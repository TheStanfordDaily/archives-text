## Daring, unusual music to come Symphony season looks good 
### Andrew M. Moravcsik 
This is a daring and unusual
season for the San Francisco
Symphony, featuring many
obscure and rarely performed
works. However, despite this
emphasis, next month's prog
rams can provide many enjoy
able evenings to the dedicated
listener. A group of varied and
distinguished guest conductors
will lead the orchestra, cul
minating in the season premiere
of Edo de Waart, San Francisco's
new permanent director.

Jan. 19, 20, 21, 22:
Bartok, Two Portraits, Op. 5;
Bartok, Vio/in Concerto No. 2;
Bartok, The Miraculous Manda
rin (Ballet Music)
In keeping with the adventur
ousness of this season's prog
ramming, this concert presents
only the works of the 20th Cen
tury Hungarian composer Bela
Bartok. Pinchas Zukerman, one
ot the world's finest violinists,
should combine with Ozawa's
empathy toward dance music to
make the evening a success.
Especially interesting is The
Miraculous Mandarin, the con
cert version of a rarely per
formed ballet written in 1919.
Describable perhaps as a syn
thesis of a rhythmic driving style
(much like Stravinsky) and
yearning soft passages, this work
should bring the concert to an
exciting conclusion.

Jan. 26, 27, 28. 29:
Bizet, Symphony in C;

Druckman, Mirage;
Brahms, Double Concerto for
Violin and Cello
A concert with something of
interest to everyone. Leonard
Slatkin, a young American guest
conductor, will begin the even
ing with Bizet's Symphony in C,
written when the composer was
only 17. He never wrote another
symphony, instead going on
to compose such masterworks as
Carmen. This youthful attempt,
however, is not a one-shot fai
lure; rather it is a charming and
melodic success.
Slatkin is especially interested
in promoting the works of
American composers (he him
self composes prolifically) and
has chosen Mirage, a recent work
by Jacob Druckman, as the sec
ond selection.
The concert will close with the
Brahms Double Concerto, a
piece so full of melody and ex
citment that one cannot help but
enjoy it. Furthermore, this per
formance will give the audience
the unique opportunity to see
the symphony's concertmaster,
Stuart Canin, as a soloist, along
with Lynn Harrell, a famous
young American cellist.
1 would recommend this con
cert to everyone, whether or not
they feel themselves to be "clas
sical music types." In addition to
the performances at the Opera
House, this program will be
given Jan. 29 at the Flint Center
in Cupertino.

Feb. 2, 3, 4, 5:
Ginastera, Concerto for String
Orchestra;
Beethoven, Piano Concerto No.
1;
Sibelius, Symphony No. 5
Leonard Slatkin's second
program with the symphony be
gins with an orchestral concerto
bv the 20th centurv Italian com

poser. Ginastera. This is a piece
that has recently found a place in
the standard repertoire. The
modern work will be followed
by Beethoven's Piano Concerto
No. 1, an early Mozartian work
that will be interpreted by Chris
toph Eschenbach, a well-known
pianist.
The Sibelius Symphony No. 5
was born of the chaos at the out
break of World War 1. Chased out
of his hometown by Fascists,
Sibelius ended up hidden in an
insane asylum in Helsinki. The
Bolsheviks commandeered it for
troop barracks and he was left
alone. Also during the years in
which the symphony was con
ceived, Sibelius underwent no
less than 14 major operations for
cancer.
These events are mirrored in
this symphony, which he re
wrote twice in an attempt to ex
press his feelings more accu
rately. The result is a gripping,
powerful work filled with angry
emotion; it is one of Sibelius'
finest symphonies.

Feb. 9, 11, 12:
Debussy, Printemps;
Debussy, Three Nocturnes;
Poulenc, La Voix Humaine /The
Human Voice)
The remarkable Sarah
Caldwell, who almost
singlehandedly brought the Bos
ton Opera to national promi
nence, will lead the symphony
and its Women's Chorus in this
vocal concert. One of the leading
lyric and dramatic conductors in
the world, Caldwell has chosen a
set of uniquely beautiful works
for this program.
Debussy's Three Nocturnes for
women's chorus and orchestra
demonstrates the amazing ver
satility ofboth the composer and
the human voice. The first noc
turne, entitled "The Fates," is a

rhythmic, driving piece,
whereas the second. "Clouds,"
is quintessential Debussy,
dreamy and impressionistic.
The final nocturne. "Sirens," is
sweet and seductive; the roman
tic legend interpreted by a wo
men's choir.
Poulenc's one-act opera. La
V'oix Humuine, is a monologue
with orchestra, portraying (in
the first person) the anguish of a
young woman talking to her ex
lover on the telephone. It simul
taneously exhibits the pain of re
jection. the impersonality of the
telephone, and the emptiness
engendered by the death of
young love. A work of warm sen
suousness and brilliant musical
description, this could well be
one of the highlights of the entire
season. PhyllisCurtin will inter
pret the solo role. This is a con
cert not to be missed by any con
noisseur of vocal music.

Feb. 16, 17, IH, 19:
Berlioz, Overture to"LeCorsair"
Bartok, Piano Concerto No. 3;
Dvorak, Symphony No. 8
David Ramadanoff will guest
conduct this program with Mi
scha Dichteras the piano soloist.
The Bartok Piano Concerto
No. 3, written as a final gift to his
wife, was the last piece com
posed before Bartok's death in
1945 (in fact, he was unable to
finish the last 17 bars).
It is a brilliant example of Bar
tok's later style, a basically intro
spective work containing many
of the gripping, driving sections
that only 20th century compos
ers were finally able to capture in
piano music. Mischa Dichter,
one of the finest pianists around
today, should provide an effec
tive interpretation.
Dvorak's Symphony No. 8 is
often lost (along with the earlier
Dvorak symphonies) in the

popular effervescence surround
ing his last work in this form, the
Symphony No. 9 "From the New
World." Nevertheless, the
Eighth Symphony stands on its
own merits. It combines
Dvorak's broad melodious style
and his addiction to folk music
from his native Czechoslovakia
with sparkling originality, both
in form and technique. This
gives his music a pleasing
freshness often hidden in the
work of his contemporaries,
making this symphony a truly
enjoyable experience.

Feb. 23, 24, 25. 26:
Beethoven. Incidental Music to
"Egrnont";
Beethoven, Symj)hony No. 9
"Chora I"
Edo de Waart, San Francisco's
new permanent conductor,
makes his season debut in this
concert, leading the Symphony
in the Incidental Music to "Eg
rnont" (the overture is well
known) and Beethoven's Sym
phony No. 9 in D minor.
What can 1 say about the
Ninth? Every possible adjective
has been used to describe Beet
hoven's final monument in the
symphonic form, and we are no
closer to understanding its time
less and universal popularity
than those listeners at the pre
miere in 1824. Many have
criticized it, multitudes worship
it; few would deny that it is an
experience everyone should
have once in their lives.
So, instead of adding to this
cacophony of comment, I will
simply say that you'd better snag
a ticket now because there won't
be any left on the eve of the con
cert. Saturday's performance is a
De Anza College.
