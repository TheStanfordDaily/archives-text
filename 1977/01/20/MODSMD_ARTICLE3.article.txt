# Stanford defies rising crime rate trend
## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
The nationwide t'-end of ever
increasing crime rates has been re
versed at Stanford and Palo Alto.
According to Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington, there has
been a "marked decrease" in
burglaries, from 214 in 1974-75 to 192
in 1975-76; petty theft, from 630 to
471; and malicious mischief a drop
from 190 to 116 cases reported on
campus.
Statistics indicatea definite increase
in robberies, five in 1974-75 to seven in
1975-76; grand theft, 116 to 137; and
bike thefts, 507 to 613.
Grand theft, a felony, is defined as
the theft of money, labor, real or per
sonal property valued at over $200, or
the theft of certain nuts, fruits and
domestic fowl valued over $50, or the
theft of guns, automobiles or farm
animals. All other theft is considered
petty theft, a misdemeanor.
Palo Alto crime reports show con
siderable stability in the crime rate.
However, statistics reveal a marked in
crease in aggravated assault, but a de
crease in the number of thefts and
burglaries committed.
Aggravated assault
Aggravated, or felony, assault is the
unlawful attempt to commit violent in
jury upon another by use of a weapon
or dangerous chemicals or with the in
tent to commit some other felony such
as rape or murder. All other assaults
are misdemeanors.
A fiscal year, starting in June, is used
by Palo Alto police for recording statis
tics, so figures for 1976-77 are still in
complete. Palo Alto police also use the
Federal Bureau of Investigation clas
sification of larceny ($5O and over) as

the measure of thefts. This category
roughly corresponds to the grand arid
petty theft categories used by Stanford
public safety officers.
Lt. Robert Ludden, of the University
of California police at Berkeley, sum
med up the situation there. "Some
crimes are up and some are down."
Decrease at Berkeley
Statistics show a dramatic decrease
in the number of aggravated assaults,
robberies, burglaries, arsons, bomb
threats and sex crimes other than rape
on the Berkeley campus. Petty thefts
and bike thefts have noticeably in
creased. The net effect of these
changes is to bring the UC-Berkeley
crime rate to a level 16.8 per cent above
that encountered at Stanford.
Comparing the three jurisdictions,
aggravated assaults are down on both
campuses while up in Palo Alto,
burglaries are down in all three areas,
while grand theft is down at Berkeley
and Palo Alto but up at Stanford. Bomb
threats, a characteristic of the period
surrounding Symbionese Liberation
Army activities, has also decreased.
Public Safety Captain Raoul
Niemeyer attributed the decrease in
crime rates to increased patrol.
"This place used to be considered a
cherry patch . . . but the word has got
ten out. We used to stumble over these
people (assorted thieves). They
seemed to be pretty sedentary, but now
our repeaters are gone and they just
aren't coming back. I have to attribute
it to concentrated, vigorous patrol,"
said Niemeyer.
Reasons for decrease
Palo Alto Police Lt. Chuck Hauser
attributed the decrease in that city's
crime to the combined effects of a large
number of factors.

"We like to attribute the decline to
crime prevention programs, field en
forcement, observation patrol and fol
lowup investigations, but it's a combi
nation of what occurs in the courts,
too. This is only one part of the overall
picture.
"There have been changes in the
economic picture, job market and so
cial and economic structure of the
community. .. . There's been a decline
in youth population. There are a lot
more older people, a lot more senior
citizens. . . . Maybe we're just spend
ing money, but we think it-'s had an
effect," said Hauser.
Assaults up
In Palo Alto, curiously, this sup
posed decrease in the number of young
people occurred while the number of
assaults, a crime classically associated
with youth, increased.
Ludden was more succinct in at
tempting to guess causes for the
change in crime rates in his jurisdic
tion.
"Most likely it's the result of in

creased patrol in the troubled areas.
The trend is going down; auto theft
and burglary went down .. .
homicides are up," said Ludden.
Berkeley suffered its first homicide
of the year Sunday, Ludden said.
Community pressure
UC-Berkeley police have been under
considerable community pressure to
reduce the number of sex offenses oc
curring in their jurisdiction. They
have apparently succeeded in doing
so. However, increases in thefts offset
these reductions.
Changes in demographic factors
over the past two years have not been
significant in any of the communities.
The statistical differences in crime
rates appear to be consistent with
changes in enforcement policies and
general increased police efficiency.
Increased community efforts to pre
vent certain crimes may also be re
flected in these changes.
The increase in bike thefts on both
campuses will be specifically consi
dered in an upcoming analysis.

Community pressure
UC-Berkeley police have been under
considerable community pressure to
reduce the number of sex offenses oc
curring in their jurisdiction. They
have apparently succeeded in doing
so. However, increases in thefts offset
these reductions.
Changes in demographic factors
over the past two years have not been
significant in any of the communities.
The statistical differences in crime
rates appear to be consistent with
changes in enforcement policies and
general increased police efficiency.
Increased community efforts to pre
vent certain crimes may also be re
flected in these changes.

creased because of this specialization, according to
John Martin, Transition manager.
The nationwide t'-end of ever
increasing crime rates has been re
versed at Stanford and Palo Alto.
According to Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington, there has
been a "marked decrease" in
burglaries, from 214 in 1974-75 to 192
in 1975-76; petty theft, from 630 to
471; and malicious mischief a drop
from 190 to 116 cases reported on
campus.
Statistics indicatea definite increase
in robberies, five in 1974-75 to seven in
1975-76; grand theft, 116 to 137; and
bike thefts, 507 to 613.
Grand theft, a felony, is defined as
the theft of money, labor, real or per
sonal property valued at over $200, or
the theft of certain nuts, fruits and
domestic fowl valued over $50, or the
theft of guns, automobiles or farm
animals. All other theft is considered
petty theft, a misdemeanor.
Palo Alto crime reports show con
siderable stability in the crime rate.
However, statistics reveal a marked in
crease in aggravated assault, but a de
crease in the number of thefts and
burglaries committed.
Aggravated assault
Aggravated, or felony, assault is the
unlawful attempt to commit violent in
jury upon another by use of a weapon
or dangerous chemicals or with the in
tent to commit some other felony such
as rape or murder. All other assaults
are misdemeanors.
A fiscal year, starting in June, is used
by Palo Alto police for recording statis
tics, so figures for 1976-77 are still in
complete. Palo Alto police also use the
Federal Bureau of Investigation clas
sification of larceny ($5O and over) as

the measure of thefts. This category
roughly corresponds to the grand arid
petty theft categories used by Stanford
public safety officers.
Lt. Robert Ludden, of the University
of California police at Berkeley, sum
med up the situation there. "Some
crimes are up and some are down."
Decrease at Berkeley
Statistics show a dramatic decrease
in the number of aggravated assaults,
robberies, burglaries, arsons, bomb
threats and sex crimes other than rape
on the Berkeley campus. Petty thefts
and bike thefts have noticeably in
creased. The net effect of these
changes is to bring the UC-Berkeley
crime rate to a level 16.8 per cent above
that encountered at Stanford.
Comparing the three jurisdictions,
aggravated assaults are down on both
campuses while up in Palo Alto,
burglaries are down in all three areas,
while grand theft is down at Berkeley
and Palo Alto but up at Stanford. Bomb
threats, a characteristic of the period
surrounding Symbionese Liberation
Army activities, has also decreased.
Public Safety Captain Raoul
Niemeyer attributed the decrease in
crime rates to increased patrol.
"This place used to be considered a
cherry patch . . . but the word has got
ten out. We used to stumble over these
people (assorted thieves). They
seemed to be pretty sedentary, but now
our repeaters are gone and they just
aren't coming back. I have to attribute
it to concentrated, vigorous patrol,"
said Niemeyer.
Reasons for decrease
Palo Alto Police Lt. Chuck Hauser
attributed the decrease in that city's
crime to the combined effects of a large
number of factors.

"We like to attribute the decline to
crime prevention programs, field en
forcement, observation patrol and fol
lowup investigations, but it's a combi
nation of what occurs in the courts,
too. This is only one part of the overall
picture.
"There have been changes in the
economic picture, job market and so
cial and economic structure of the
community. .. . There's been a decline
in youth population. There are a lot
more older people, a lot more senior
citizens. . . . Maybe we're just spend
ing money, but we think it-'s had an
effect," said Hauser.
Assaults up
In Palo Alto, curiously, this sup
posed decrease in the number of young
people occurred while the number of
assaults, a crime classically associated
with youth, increased.
Ludden was more succinct in at
tempting to guess causes for the
change in crime rates in his jurisdic
tion.

attributed the decrease in that city's
crime to the combined effects of a large
number of factors.

"We like to attribute the decline to
crime prevention programs, field en
forcement, observation patrol and fol
lowup investigations, but it's a combi
nation of what occurs in the courts,
too. This is only one part of the overall
picture.
"There have been changes in the
economic picture, job market and so
cial and economic structure of the
community. .. . There's been a decline
in youth population. There are a lot
more older people, a lot more senior
citizens. . . . Maybe we're just spend
ing money, but we think it-'s had an
effect," said Hauser.
Assaults up
In Palo Alto, curiously, this sup
posed decrease in the number of young
people occurred while the number of
assaults, a crime classically associated
with youth, increased.
Ludden was more succinct in at
tempting to guess causes for the
change in crime rates in his jurisdic
tion.
"Most likely it's the result of in

creased patrol in the troubled areas.
The trend is going down; auto theft
and burglary went down .. .
homicides are up," said Ludden.
Berkeley suffered its first homicide
of the year Sunday, Ludden said.
Community pressure
UC-Berkeley police have been under
considerable community pressure to
reduce the number of sex offenses oc
curring in their jurisdiction. They
have apparently succeeded in doing
so. However, increases in thefts offset
these reductions.
Changes in demographic factors
over the past two years have not been
significant in any of the communities.
The statistical differences in crime
rates appear to be consistent with
changes in enforcement policies and
general increased police efficiency.
Increased community efforts to pre
vent certain crimes may also be re
flected in these changes.
The increase in bike thefts on both
campuses will be specifically consi
dered in an upcoming analysis.

their registers. Efficiency at the restaurant has in
creased because of this specialization, according to
John Martin, Transition manager.
The nationwide t'-end of ever
increasing crime rates has been re
versed at Stanford and Palo Alto.
According to Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington, there has
been a "marked decrease" in
burglaries, from 214 in 1974-75 to 192
in 1975-76; petty theft, from 630 to
471; and malicious mischief a drop
from 190 to 116 cases reported on
campus.
Statistics indicatea definite increase
in robberies, five in 1974-75 to seven in
1975-76; grand theft, 116 to 137; and
bike thefts, 507 to 613.
Grand theft, a felony, is defined as
the theft of money, labor, real or per
sonal property valued at over $200, or
the theft of certain nuts, fruits and
domestic fowl valued over $50, or the
theft of guns, automobiles or farm
animals. All other theft is considered
petty theft, a misdemeanor.
Palo Alto crime reports show con
siderable stability in the crime rate.
However, statistics reveal a marked in
crease in aggravated assault, but a de
crease in the number of thefts and
burglaries committed.
Aggravated assault
Aggravated, or felony, assault is the
unlawful attempt to commit violent in
jury upon another by use of a weapon
or dangerous chemicals or with the in
tent to commit some other felony such
as rape or murder. All other assaults
are misdemeanors.
A fiscal year, starting in June, is used
by Palo Alto police for recording statis
tics, so figures for 1976-77 are still in
complete. Palo Alto police also use the
Federal Bureau of Investigation clas
sification of larceny ($5O and over) as

the measure of thefts. This category
roughly corresponds to the grand arid
petty theft categories used by Stanford
public safety officers.
Lt. Robert Ludden, of the University
of California police at Berkeley, sum
med up the situation there. "Some
crimes are up and some are down."
Decrease at Berkeley
Statistics show a dramatic decrease
in the number of aggravated assaults,
robberies, burglaries, arsons, bomb
threats and sex crimes other than rape
on the Berkeley campus. Petty thefts
and bike thefts have noticeably in
creased. The net effect of these
changes is to bring the UC-Berkeley
crime rate to a level 16.8 per cent above
that encountered at Stanford.
Comparing the three jurisdictions,
aggravated assaults are down on both
campuses while up in Palo Alto,
burglaries are down in all three areas,
while grand theft is down at Berkeley
and Palo Alto but up at Stanford. Bomb
threats, a characteristic of the period
surrounding Symbionese Liberation
Army activities, has also decreased.
Public Safety Captain Raoul
Niemeyer attributed the decrease in
crime rates to increased patrol.
"This place used to be considered a
cherry patch . . . but the word has got
ten out. We used to stumble over these
people (assorted thieves). They
seemed to be pretty sedentary, but now
our repeaters are gone and they just
aren't coming back. I have to attribute
it to concentrated, vigorous patrol,"
said Niemeyer.
