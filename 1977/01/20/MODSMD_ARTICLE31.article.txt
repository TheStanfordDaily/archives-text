# Talented musicians make merry
## 
### Dean Eyre 
As one of the highlights of last quarter. Robin
Williamson, co-founder of the Incredible
String Band (ISB),presented the musical talents
of his newly formed group, Robin Williamson
and His Merry Band, in theTresidder Lounge.
Seeing the band perform was truly an enjoy
able and educational experience.
From its origins in 1965 until termination in
1974, the success of the ISB was largely the
result of the materials produced by William
son. His reputation was a writer and musician
spread with the growth of popularity experi
enced by the group.
Two powerful and complimentary quotes
put the .talent of Williamson into perspective.
The New Musical Express wrote in 1968 that
"The Incredible String Band is the most potent,
unique and dynamic force to brighten our dull
existence for a long, long while ..." Karl Dal
las in Melody Maker, Dec. '73, said "Such di
verse persons as John Lennon and Bob Dylan
have confessed to an admiration of the Incredi
bles, and in particular the songwriting talents
of Robin Williamson."
The new "Merry Band" was formed in June
1976. The current group's music has been very
favorably compared to the best of the early ISB
sound. They completed a successful six-week

tour of the East Coast in September, playing
important locales such as The Bottom Line in
New York and the Philadelphia Folk Festival.
Besides his career in music, Williamson has
done well in other fields, having written books,
poetry and TV scripts. In response to a de
mand for a history on British traditional music,
he wrote Fiddle Tunes; Traditional Music of
England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Oak
Books, publisher for the volume, is also pub
lishing his book on penny whistles.
Lecturing at universities and colleges, Wil
liamson has also had his lyrics and poetry in
cluded in school English programs. A Cana
dian text, The Poetry of Relevance, credits him
with developing a new style of poetry, "Magi
cal Realism."
In addition to these activities and his con
tributions of writing music and lyrics, Wil
liamson also arranges instrumentation and
adaptations of traditional British music, and
joins his group with vocals, guitar, fiddle,
mandolin and penny whistle.
Who makes up the rest of the group? The
components of "The Merry Band" include
Chris Caswell, Jerry McMillan and Sylvia
Snyder.
Caswell, of British ancestry and a native of
northern California, specializes in pipes, Scot-

tish harp, vocals, penny whistle and bodhran.
Because he's played Scots drums in pipe bands
since he was seven and bagpipes since he was
in his teens, he has plenty of experience to add
to the group.
His studies include classes at the renowned
Glasgow College of Piping and lessons in Scot
tish harp in Edinburgh. At the Centre of Oral
Traditions in Devonshire, Caswell studied
traditional music, and recently he learned con
struction techniques of harps and works as a
company representative for Witcher Harps.
Jerry McMillan, of Scottish descent, is a na
tive of New York and grew up in both New
York and California. His musical background
includes playing viola at age 10, and then
branching out into Celtic and fiddle music.
Caswell and McMillan formed part of a group
called the Celtic Tradition in the early '70s.
Sylvia Snyder, raised in southern California,
began her career on classical harp while in her
teens. She played with local orchestras, and
when not performing, she teaches Celtic harp
classes. Snyder joined McMillan and Caswell
in traditional music and instrument work
shops at UCLA and at folk festivals across the
country.
The Tresidder concert was very enjoyable,
displaying the talents that have made William-

son an integral part of modern folk music and
showing great promise for his new band. The
musical artistry and lively sense of humor re
vealed an attitude ot warmth that is rare amidst
a money oriented art world. The "Merry
Band was deservedly well received during
their presentation in the second floor lounge.
Following the concert, Williamson
answered questions about the group anil his
thoughts on music.
Beginning with the Incredible String Band,
Williamson has evolved a unique mixture of
musical forms. "The basic theme is medieval
and Celtic music . . . Traditional instrumental
pieces are the basic root to build from, . . he
explained. The band, "using different styles of
music, explores the possibilities of arranging
the many and varied sounds thatemanate from
his unusual array of instruments.
He thinks ISB is perhaps becom
ing too electrified in sound, and said that he
can really "express better with acoustic
music." His present group performs inusic
much like the early ISB. but is gifted with an
"entirely unique sound with touches of jazz,
folk and classical."
Looking back over his career, Williamson
recalled that "there was a tremendous burst of
energy between 1966 and 1970 when the music

business became mammoth." The industry tie
came "glossy while a creative spark rubbed at
the edges," he said. Now that music has be
come commercial, he said, "there is a healthy
underground of coffeehouse entertainment
like the late '505."
In comparing the two cultures, Williamson
said that "American music is very classy,"
while British music to a large extent is built
upon "traditional Irish instrumentals" as well
as other native musical forms of the British
Isles. Williamson noted that the same sort of
difference between American and British
music styles can be seen between Eastern and
Western styles. For example, Ravi Shankar is
received formally in the U.S. and England,
while in India, his audiences are "rowdy."
This illustrates that musical interpretation is a
factor of the culture and the development ot
tastes within that culture, according to Wil
liamson.
Williamson described his feelings for live
performances by saying that "we are booking
concerts of medium and small size where con
tact is strong."
Those at all interested in folk music, or for
that matter, music in general, should definitely
keep track of the very promising future of
Robin Williamson and His Merry Band.
