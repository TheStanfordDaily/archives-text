# Weisberg's variety perks up Cal

### Susie Kaplan Wendy Enkema 
Cal's Zellerbach auditorium
may not have been full last Fri
day but the audience that
atteAdbd the Tim Weisberg con
cert got what they came for: an
evening of entertainment rang
ing from lyrical melodies to a
free form rock jam. In spite of the
absence of Lynn Blessing and his
keyboards, Doug Anderson,
Todd Robinson, Ty Grimes and a
guest drummer easily managed
to produce a complete show.
Weisberg, dressed in a black
velvet suit, seemed to become
his music. His body movements,
almost dancelike, seemed to
reiterate everv cadence his flute

played. It was a kind of body
language with which he spoke to
the audience.
Apparently to Weisberg an
nouncing his song titles was un
necessary, for he only intro
duced three. "Angelic Smile" of
fered a change of pace in that
only two acoustic guitars were
used; Weisberg and flute rested.
"Dion Blue" continued during
this acoustical music with the
unique sound of an alto flute. It
was during this song that Weis
berg demonstrated his ability to
reach the often untouched low
notes.
These pastoral melodies were
set off by "California Marriage"
which returned the pace to the

strong leads and drums heard
earlier in the evening. The un
ited effort of all these instru
ments, even the percussion and
bongos, helped to bond an inten
sity of sound and volume.
The band's vacillation bet
ween the easygoing, soft ballads
and the heavier rock forms of
emphasized lead and bass guitar
exemplified the innovativeness
of Weisberg's work.
The Rowans, preceding Weis
berg and company, managed to
hype the audience to levels of
laughter, participation
interaction, and enthusiasm for
listening. "Panama Red" grab
bed everyone's attention at the
start, and from then on they
never let go. "Pretty Senorita"
brought one of the band mem
bers into the audience, asking for
a dance in song; a parody of the

machismo syndrome in Mexican
male performers. The theme
again took an immediate turnab
out with "Ready forthe Rapture"
â€” a song full of strong harmony
and a quick, simple beat.
A strong focua on the
keyboard and percussion, unex
pected cut-offs in midsong as
well as a hint of a light show all
suggested a complete act as op
posed to just a musical presenta
tion. "Crazy People" seemed to
culminate all of their strong,
precise vocals, stressing themes
in their music which seem so re
levant today.
SUPERB, the ASUC student
promoters, should be com
mended for choosing their open
ing act so as to complement the
main attraction. Such was the
case with the Rowans and Tim
Weisberg.
