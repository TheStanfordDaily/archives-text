# A
						visit to MASH
## 
### Wendy Ikeguchi (First of two parts) 
P.O.W. to Hawkeye, "That
strikes me as a very ugly wo
man."
Hawkeye to P.0.W., "You
should see her naked."
The "woman" of course is
Corporal Klinger, famed
pseudo-transvestite of the
4077 th Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital, Korea. The place is
Stage 9 of 20th Century-Fox
Studios, home of M *A *S *H, the
most successful blend of comedy
and tragedy in television history
(winner of Emmys, the Peabodv
Award, etc. and one of the few
CBS shows still high in the rat
ings.) The comedy is derived
from the plight of army medical
personnel trying to survive in an
insane situation. The tragedy is
war.
Executive producer Gene
Reynolds directs the day's
episode concerning a wounded
North Korean doctor who "de
fects." Reynolds, an uncom
monly kind man, read a script I
had written for the show (which
didn't sell) and allowed me to
visit the set. I must say I went
more us a guest than as a repor
ter, although when 1 jotted notes,
Gary Burghoff (Radar) accused
me of being with the C I A.
We are surrounded by the
painted backdrop of instant
Korea, the Swamp, the O.R.
(operating room), technicians
wheeling lights and sound
equipment over the rubber floor
ing that serves as compound
dirt. The set bulletin board is
tacked with letters: a soldier
writes thatMM *S*H makes him
laugh and cry, another letter is
from Larry Gelbart, the former
creative genius behind
M*A*S*H, who's written Sly
Fox for the Broadway stage.
Relaxing
Between takes the actors relax
in the Officers Club set. There's a
lot of kidding around, some of it
funny and some not. (Actors are
people and therefore not always
amusing.) As they play Scrabble,
they often assume accents or
voice characterizations, e.g.
Alan Alda (Hawkeye) as a de
spairing Peter Lorre, "I can't find
dee letter!" or Mike Farrell (8.J.)
as a piqued Britisher, "Aow,
don't be such an arse." As the
game ends, winner Alda smiles
as fourth place Jamie Farr
(Klinger) declares, "Okay, that
was a draw."
During rehearsal, missed cues
and line flubs are not uncom
mon. For example, Hawkeye
re Frank and Margaret: "They
don't seem as bad as thevcreely
are." A poor pun can also make
for laughter: when Reynolds di
rects guest star Soon-Teck Oh,
"When Soon risesâ€”" someone
mutters. "The Sun Also Rises."
During a take, however, the ac
tors suddenly become precise
and professional and every take,
again and again, ad infinitum
and sometimes even more, is like
the one before, not a position
changed, not a tone altered. So
nearly perfect one can begin to

appreciate the incredible skill it
takes to be a good actor, espe
cially in the talented, complex
ensemble cast ofM*A *S*H. (Un
fortunately I did not talk with the
show's most experienced actor,
Harry Morgan (Potter),who was
not on call that day.)
Fun to do
A horn sounds as if from the
depths of Sherwood Forest and
Burghoff booms a musical
"IVANHOE!" in reply. Farrell
and Loretta Swit (Margaret)
dance to nonexistent music, he
sweeps her off her feet and car
ries her on to the set. The crew
agrees that M*A*S*H is a fun
show to do and that the work is
carried out with high efficiency
despite the horseplay. Scott, a
stage hand, was friendly and
willing to answer any questions,
as was wardrobe man Barry. As a
matter of fact, everyone was
quite cooperative.
Among the bells, buzzers,
phones ringing, and occasional
bursts into song are the sound
effects of Larry Linville (Frank),
whose repertoire includes sheep
bleats, chicken clucks and

chimp chuckles enough to be his
own jungle. Linville. who de
signs and flies his own gliders,
suggests that women make bet
ter pilots than men because
women are generally more
methodical. As this is Linville's
last season with M*A*S*H, the
question of a replacement an
tagonist has been raised and so
far remains unanswered. Lin
ville himself will continue his
voluminous work on his book
about his grandfather who was a
turn-of-the-century frontier doc
tor. When asked what he will do
after this season's end, Linville
quipped, "Sleep."
Loretta Swit disapproved of
Linville's smoking while she
was present so he graciously
pounded out his cigarette in a
beautifully over-played manner
to oblige her. And yes. folks, it
looks like Margaret Houlihan
will be getting married soon and
she may even borrow Klinger's
wadding dress to do it. As

Swit needlepointed a bear, she
told me that she had just finished
two paintings, one of which she
gave to Fair, and that she had no
plans for the off-season. (Last
year she starred in Broadway's
Same Time, Next Year.) How
ever, Farr did remark that, "she's
in love," but 1 did not pursue the
subject.
Burbling creativity
Alan Alda gives the impres
sion of an easy-going yet intense
personality, which is probably
due to all that creativity burbling
inside him. Besides being an ac
complished actor in such works
as the devastating prison drama
The Glass House, the black
comedy-mystery Isn't It Shock
ing? and Lily Tomlin's TV spe
cial Lily, Alda is a writer
director-producer. Last year he
created an honest, witty and
warm humor-with-feeling series
called We'll Get By which is now
off the air. Alda has also won
every conceivable TV award in
cluding what he once called the
"grand, high, exalted" one-time
only 1974 Super Emmy. He
wrote and directed the episode

"Dear Sigmund," a sure bet for
Emmy nominations.
The past summer Jamie Farr
(who still enjoys the adult flavor
of Ova'tine even though Alda
sniffed a jar of it distastefully
and noted that 110 calorics was
too much) took his nightclub act
to several East Coast colleges be
cause he loves the response of
the young audience. Recently he
gave his wife an emerald along
with the words, "You're the joy
of Life." Joy is his wife's name
and if that ain't class, what is?
Farr's a warm friendly person,
but it was odd that when we took
his picture the film broke. No
kidding.
(Part two is coming up on Tues
day, but you can catch ardent
feminist and head of Men for
ERA (equal rights amendment)
Alan Alda this Saturday nig/it
on ABC's Closeup on the ERA.
channel 7 at 10 p.m.)
