Pardon, farewells end Ford's term
Washington — While Jimmy Carter journeyed to power,
President Gerald Ford cleaned out his desk yesterday,
telephoned his farewells to world leaders and pardoned
Tokyo Rose.
Ford also approved what amounted to a token change in
the rules on clemency for Vietnam-era military deserters,
but rejected blanket amnesty.
He bestowed medals on two national security aides. He
received 24 new Republican members of Congress and
told them he intends to go on "speaking for and standing
for the goals of the Republican party."
He telephoned Soviet party leader Leonid Brezhnev for
a 15-minute farewell conversation. Ford's spokesman
would not disclose what they said.
Among other world leaders Ford called were French
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
Ford issued a pardon to Iva Toguri D'Aquino, convicted
of treason in 1949 as one of the women known to millions
of World War II servicemen as Tokyo Rose. She served 6V2
years in prison. D'Aquino now is operator of the Oriental
Gift Shop in Chicago.
Again, and finally, Ford rejected blanket amnesty for
Vietnam draft dodgers and deserters, but did direct that
honorable discharges be given to wounded or decorated
veterans who did not receive them.
A spokesman said that would apply to no more than 700
former servicemen.
At the Oval Office, Ford's desktop was clear. "It's the
first time the desk has been like that," he said.
Ford seeks decontrol of gas prices
Washington — President Gerald Ford acted yesterday to
lift price controls from gasoline, but the action on his last
day in office ran into stiff opposition in the Democratic
controlled Congress, where moves to veto the action were
immediately launched.
The efforts under way in both House and Senate to reject
the gasoline decontrol proposal seemed likely to succeed,
with many members expressing concern about the con
sumer price impact while others saying the question
should be left to the incoming Carter administration.
Congress has 15 days to nullify Ford's move. A negative
vote in either chamber would kill the action.
Congressional critics previously said the decontrol
move could add six cents a gallon to gasoline prices paid
by motorists. The Ford administration said the price hikes
would be much lower.
The administration said an end of price controls was
necessary to provide incentives for the petroleum indus
try to increase exploration and refinery capacity. The con
trols were established in the wake of the 1973-74 Arab oil
embargo when prices were rising rapidly.
Congressional sources said opposition to the move is so
great that a vote to block it could come as early as today.
Sadat attempts to calm Egyptian rioters
Cairo — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat bowed yes
terday to the pressure of rioting that took at least seven
lives and revoked government-ordered price increases on
food and other products.
Authorities ordered a 14-hour curfew in several cities
and Rave riot police orders to shoot anyone outside with
out a pass.
Four hours after the curfew went into effect at 4 p.m.
police reported they were still battling demonstrators at
several locations, one near the People's Assembly in Cairo

and another at a string of nightclubs on the road to the
Pyramids.
In the downtown area of Cairo, however, streets were
generally quiet. There was no vehicle traffic, though a few
people walked about.
Police officials said at least seven persons had been
killed and more than 200 injured in Cairo and the coastal
city of Alexandria since the demonstrations against price
increases erupted Tuesday. Witnesses to clashes said the
casualty totals were higher and blamed police fire for all of
the deaths.
Sadat, who has been pressing richer Arab nations for
more financial aid for his impoverished country, returned
to Cairo from the winter resort of Aswan to deal with the
crisis.
The deputy prime minister for economic affairs, Abdel
Moneim Kaissouni, who was responsible for the price
increases, submitted his resignation but it was im
mediately refused by Prime Minister Mamdouh Salem.
Bell approved for attorney general
Washington — Griffin Bell was approved yesterday as
President-elect Jimmy Carter's nominee to be attorney
general, making him the last of Carter's Cabinet nominees
to win recommendations from Senate panels.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10 to 3, and one
vote of present, in favor of Bell, with the three "nay" votes
coming from Republicans Charles Mathias of Maryland,
John Chafee of Rhode Island and John Heinz of Pennsyl
vania.
Sen. Donald Riegle (D-Mich.) voted present, saying he
did not support Bell for confirmation but did not wish to
go on record against sending the nomination to the Senate
floor.
Opposition to the 58-year-old Atlanta lawyer had been
based largely on his civil rights record.
Inflation held to lowest in four years
Washington — A rare annual decline in grocery prices
helped hold inflation in 1976 to the lowest rate in four
years, the government reported yesterday.
Year-end figures from the Labor Department showed
consumer prices rose a moderate four-tenths of one per
cent in December. For the year, they were up 4.8 per cent.
This was the best annual price performance the
economy has shown since 1972, when government wage
price controls held increases to 3.4 per cent.
It also was a sharp improvement from the seven per cent
increase recorded in 1975 and far better than the 12.2 per
cent jump in 1974 and the 8.8 per cent inflation rate in
1973.
Falling prices for beef, pork and poultry led a nine
tenths per cent drop in grocery prices last year, the first
over-the-year decline in 15 years, the government said. In
1975, grocery prices rose 6.2 per cent.
Food prices rose two-tenths per cent in December, be
cause of higher costs for beef, eggs, coffee, poultry, fruits,
vegetables and restaurant meals.
Coffee prices jumped another 6.8 per cent last month,
bringing the rise for the year to 57.9 per cent.
Prices for nonfood commodities and services rose last
year, but at a slower rate than in 1975.
The price figures were the most favorable of the ad
ministration's final economic statistics.
Today's weather
Variable high clouds today and tomorrow with local
late night and morning fog and low clouds. Lows both
nights in the 30s to low 40s. Highs both days in the upper
40s and 50s.
