# Main library addition to cost $8.3 million
## 
### Laura Kennedy Staff writer 
The university will sign a nearly
$8.3 million construction contract
with Dickman Construction, Inc. for
the Main Library addition within a
week to 10 days, according to Jim Nel
son, director of facilities and proper
ties.
The groundbreaking ceremony for

the addition will be held Feb. 8, when
the entire Main Library complex will
be formally renamed the Cecil H.
Green Library after its principal donor.
Dickman's bid was substantially
lower than the architect's original bid
of $11.8 million.
"Needless to say, I'm very pleased,"
said Construction Manager John Lerry
after he opened the seven general con
tractors' bids last Thursday.
"It's a good bid reflecting today's
market," said Robert Stodder, a rep
resentative for the architectural firm of
Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, Inc.
Assoc. Provost Ed Shaw said, "It's a
very good bid. It'll probably allow us to
do things we couldn't do."
In addition to construction of the
Main Library addition, the university
is considering adding a third floor to
the addition, and renovating the pre
sent Main Library.
David Weber, director of university
libraries, said, "My hope is that there
will be funds to go ahead with the third
floor and the absolutely necessary re
novations in the old building. I'm
cautiously optimistic."
However, Nelson said, "I don't think
anyone knows at this time" what addi
tional construction the university will
be able to do.
Nelson surmised that the university
would not choose either the third floor
or the renovation, but some combina
tion of both projects. He estimated that
a final decision on the extra projects
would be made in a couple weeks.
About 170 people have been invited
to the groundbreaking ceremonies, ac
cording to David Fulton, director of
communications for the General Sec
retary's Office.
