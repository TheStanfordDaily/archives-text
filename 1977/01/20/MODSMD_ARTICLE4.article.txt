# Carter begins his term today
## 
### 
Washington (AF) — Jimmy Carter,
who emerged from the obscurity of
rural Georgia to become one of the
political phenomena of the United
States' first 200 years, will be the first
president inaugurated in the nation's
third century.
There will be the usual assortment of
ceremonies today: the oath adminis
tered by the chief justice of the United
States, a chilled audience of
thousands, the inauguration parade
which organizers say will last less than
two hours.
Ahead of that come other festivities:
a gala at the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts with a wide assort
ment of show business personalities, a
prayer service on the steps of the Lin
coln Memorial featuring the Rev. Mar
tin Luther King Sr.
Carter will take the 35-word oath to
support and defend the Constitution,

administered by Chief Justice Warren
Burger, following the swearing-in of
his chosen vice president, former Sen.
Walter Mondale of Minnesota.
Other activities
For days there have been jazz and
classical music recitals, poetry read
ings, lectures and square dances in
churches, the branches of the Smith
sonian Institution, the Library of Con
gress, Capitol Hill and in the public
parks.
For the more affluent, there will be
seven inaugural balls in public build
ings and downtown hotels tonight.
Tickets to the balls cost $25 per person.
The weather forecast today in
Washington calls for temperatures of
26-30 degrees for the inaugural parade
scheduled along the IV2 miles from
Capitol Hill to the White House.
Break up the ice
The Army alerted 800 men from Ft.
George G. Meade, Md., for emergency
duty, and it called out 200 to break up
encrusted ice from the Capitol grounds
and along the parade route.
Original plans called for heating the
parade reviewing stand by solar
energy, but it appeared likely that a
supplementary electrical system
would have to be pressed into action
because of the subfreezing tempera
tures.
The grand marshal of the parade will
be former Vice President Hubert Hum
phrey, a Minnesota senator.
Future plans
In the first three months of his presi
dency, Carter's planners say Carter
will tour the United States for two
weeks, meet with the prime minister of
Canada and the president of Mexico
and address Congress and the United
Nations.
Also on Carter's suggested agenda,
drawn up by transition planners, are a
possible visit from a representative of
mainland China; a Soviet summit
meeting late in the year "wit., possible
announcement of a SALT agreement,"
and sessions with officials of Israel and
Arab nations.
"It is suggested that effective execu
tive leadership be demonstrated
through a series of early legislative vic
tories projecting the image of a 'can
do' president who has taken charge in
Washington,"says the 29-page
agenda, which concentrates mainly on
Carter's first six months. A copy was
obtained yesterday by the Associated
Press.
"As a corollary to this, the new ad
ministration cannot afford any major
early legislative defeats," the agenda
says. Proposals "should be carefully
thought through ... to maximize a
public image that a president without
previous Washington experience has
successfully demonstrated, early on,
that he can achieve major . . . reforms
and begin . . . the enactment of long
overdue legislation."
There was no immediate report of
Carter's response to the proposed
agenda, drawn up in mid- or late De
cember. But some of its suggestions
have been followed in recent weeks,
and top Carter aides have said publicly
and privately that others will be fol
lowed — indicating approval of many
of its items, if not its specific dates.

tories projecting the image of a 'can
do' president who has taken charge in
Washington,"says the 29-page
agenda, which concentrates mainly on
Carter's first six months. A copy was
obtained yesterday by the Associated
Press.
"As a corollary to this, the new ad
ministration cannot afford any major
early legislative defeats," the agenda
says. Proposals "should be carefully
thought through ... to maximize a
public image that a president without
previous Washington experience has
successfully demonstrated, early on,
that he can achieve major . . . reforms
and begin . . . the enactment of long
overdue legislation."
There was no immediate report of
Carter's response to the proposed
agenda, drawn up in mid- or late De
cember. But some of its suggestions
have been followed in recent weeks,
and top Carter aides have said publicly
and privately that others will be fol
lowed — indicating approval of many
of its items, if not its specific dates.
Washington (AF) — Jimmy Carter,
who emerged from the obscurity of
rural Georgia to become one of the
political phenomena of the United
States' first 200 years, will be the first
president inaugurated in the nation's
third century.
There will be the usual assortment of
ceremonies today: the oath adminis
tered by the chief justice of the United
States, a chilled audience of
thousands, the inauguration parade
which organizers say will last less than
two hours.
Ahead of that come other festivities:
a gala at the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts with a wide assort
ment of show business personalities, a
prayer service on the steps of the Lin
coln Memorial featuring the Rev. Mar
tin Luther King Sr.
Carter will take the 35-word oath to
support and defend the Constitution,

administered by Chief Justice Warren
Burger, following the swearing-in of
his chosen vice president, former Sen.
Walter Mondale of Minnesota.
Other activities
For days there have been jazz and
classical music recitals, poetry read
ings, lectures and square dances in
churches, the branches of the Smith
sonian Institution, the Library of Con
gress, Capitol Hill and in the public
parks.
For the more affluent, there will be
seven inaugural balls in public build
ings and downtown hotels tonight.
Tickets to the balls cost $25 per person.
The weather forecast today in
Washington calls for temperatures of
26-30 degrees for the inaugural parade
scheduled along the IV2 miles from
Capitol Hill to the White House.
Break up the ice
The Army alerted 800 men from Ft.
George G. Meade, Md., for emergency
duty, and it called out 200 to break up
encrusted ice from the Capitol grounds
and along the parade route.
Original plans called for heating the
parade reviewing stand by solar
energy, but it appeared likely that a
supplementary electrical system
would have to be pressed into action
because of the subfreezing tempera
tures.
The grand marshal of the parade will
be former Vice President Hubert Hum
phrey, a Minnesota senator.
Future plans
In the first three months of his presi
dency, Carter's planners say Carter
will tour the United States for two
weeks, meet with the prime minister of
Canada and the president of Mexico
and address Congress and the United
Nations.
Also on Carter's suggested agenda,
drawn up by transition planners, are a
possible visit from a representative of
mainland China; a Soviet summit
meeting late in the year "wit., possible
announcement of a SALT agreement,"
and sessions with officials of Israel and
Arab nations.

tive leadership be demonstrated
