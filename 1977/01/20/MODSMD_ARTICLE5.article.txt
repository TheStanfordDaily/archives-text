# Women profs view hiring policy

Of the 1146 faculty members on the Academic Council,
only 104 are women, but concern about sex discrimina
tion has ceased to be an important issue, according to
women faculty members here.
Mary Sunseri, the only female professor in the Math
Department, stated there is no discrimination there. She
said that the department tried to get more women but few
were applying for jobs because few had advanced degrees.
Those who do have their pick of positions, she said.
Science departments have a particularly low number of
female professors. The School of Earth Sciences has no
women professors at any level, and the Physics Depart
ment has one visiting woman professor.
Three of the 220 engineering professors here are female.
The Math Department and the Chemistry Department
each have one woman, one an associate professor and the
other an assistant professor.
Unconscious discrimination
Assoc. English Prof. Diane Middlebrook, former chair
person of the university's Committee on Education and
Employment of Women and current codirector of the
Center for Research on Women, said, "In my own experi
ence, discrimination hiring women at the department
level is largely unconscious."
Mary Lou Allen, adviser to Women In Science and En
gineering (WISE), said part of the problem in hiring
women comes from the "old boy network" already estab
lished. She said she feels once women establish their own
sense of "camaraderie" more women will be hired.
In the Founding Grant of the university, Sen. Leland
Stanford charged the trustees "to afford equal facilities
and give equal advantages to both sexes."
Role models
Sandra Bern, assistant professor of psychology, said the
role-model is very important. When female students see
female lecturers, but not professors, they form their own
aspirations from those facts, she said.

Anne Miner, university affirmative action officer, said
she feels the presence of women faculty members gives
students of both sexes freedom of choice in determining
their lifestyles, and enriches the intellectual quality of a
Stanford education.
The affirmative action office was founded in 1971 to
attempt to determine that all qualified people were aware
when a position was open — especially women and
minorities, Miner said.
Comparison of applicants
When an appointee is recommended for a position the
department must demonstrate the selection was fair by
comparing qualifications of all applicants.
Now is a good time to examine the affirmative action
program, Miner said. Five years ago the affirmative action
program here was better-planned and instituted earlier
than at comparable institutions. However, Miner said she
feels other universities have attained the quality of Stan
ford's programs.
She added that there are no significant differences bet
ween the sexes here in salaries or the chances of receiving
tenure. Statistically, the base percentage of females
should increase slowly during the next few years, said
Miner.
Active program
Arthur Bienenstock, faculty affirmative action officer,
said, "We have an active, successful program. Statistics
indicate we are hiring slightly more women than those
presently graduating with advanced degrees."
In a report to the Faculty Senate, he stated that 18 of the
93 appointments made last year of faculty eligible to sit on
the Academic Council were women.
Fifteen were female appointments at the assistant pro
fessor level — out of 59 total assistant professor appoint
ments.
Eleanor Maccoby, professor of psychology, said, "We
have a first rate junior (woman) faculty, although few are
tenured. I hope the situation improves as to tenured wo
men."
