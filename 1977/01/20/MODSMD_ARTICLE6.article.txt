# Is ozone layer in jeopardy?
## Experts ponder fluorocarbon ban 
### Will Nixon 
A proposed ban on fluorocarbons
used in aerosol cans has received
mixed reaction in the Stanford area.
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D
-23rd) and Senator John Dunlap (D-4th)
introduced such a ban to the California
Legislature Tuesday.
"Certainly cosmetic uses could be
banned right now," said Asst. Chemis
try Prof. Robert Wallenberg. "Why not
attach a pump to the container? I agree
with a ban right now until further
studies can be made. The questions
become much tougher when we talk
about the other uses of fluorocarbons
such as refrigeration."
During the past two years a bitter
controversy has arisen over the de
teriorating effect fluorocarbons have
on the ozone layer of the Earth's upper
atmosphere. Experiments have shown
that any decrease in this layer leads to
an increase in the incidences of human

skin cancer.
If approved, the ban will begin in
January 1978. New York, Michigan
and Oregon have already enacted simi
lar legislation.
Vasconcellos said the bill had an
"excellent" chance of passing through
both the assembly and the senate. He
said he thought the bill had strong
public support.
Dunlap said that passing this legis
lation in the senate will be "a lot of
uphill work. The vested interests will
be hard at work. But yes, 1 think it will
pass."
The bill has two parts, according to
Dunlap's assistant John Harrington.
One provision would ban the sale and
manufacture of fluorocarbon propel
lents. The other would ban the sale,
manufacture and use of aerosol cans
which contain these fluorocarbons.
The assembly had approved an al

most identical bill last year, Har
rington said. The bill then went to the
Senate Health and Welfare Committee.
However, Vasconcellos held up com
mittee work on the bill pending a Na
tional Academy of Sciences (NAS) re
port on the whole subject.
NAS released its findings in the late
summer after the Legislature had
ended its session. Under state house
rules, a previous bill can not carry over
into the new session, making this new
bill necessary.
In 1975 the senate defeated a similar
ban proposal.
"Such a ban would be a bit prema
ture." said Len Cavanagh, a program
manager in atmospheric chemistry at
the Stanford Research Institute (not
connected with the university). He
said he felt there was simply not
enough information to decide. The
NAS report recommended waiting up
