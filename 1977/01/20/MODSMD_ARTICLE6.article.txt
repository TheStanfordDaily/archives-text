# Is ozone layer in jeopardy?
## Experts ponder fluorocarbon ban 
### Will Nixon 
A proposed ban on fluorocarbons
used in aerosol cans has received
mixed reaction in the Stanford area.
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D
-23rd) and Senator John Dunlap (D-4th)
introduced such a ban to the California
Legislature Tuesday.
"Certainly cosmetic uses could be
banned right now," said Asst. Chemis
try Prof. Robert Wallenberg. "Why not
attach a pump to the container? I agree
with a ban right now until further
studies can be made. The questions
become much tougher when we talk
about the other uses of fluorocarbons
such as refrigeration."
During the past two years a bitter
controversy has arisen over the de
teriorating effect fluorocarbons have
on the ozone layer of the Earth's upper
atmosphere. Experiments have shown
that any decrease in this layer leads to
an increase in the incidences of human

skin cancer.
If approved, the ban will begin in
January 1978. New York, Michigan
and Oregon have already enacted simi
lar legislation.
Vasconcellos said the bill had an
"excellent" chance of passing through
both the assembly and the senate. He
said he thought the bill had strong
public support.
Dunlap said that passing this legis
lation in the senate will be "a lot of
uphill work. The vested interests will
be hard at work. But yes, 1 think it will
pass."
The bill has two parts, according to
Dunlap's assistant John Harrington.
One provision would ban the sale and
manufacture of fluorocarbon propel
lents. The other would ban the sale,
manufacture and use of aerosol cans
which contain these fluorocarbons.
The assembly had approved an al

most identical bill last year, Har
rington said. The bill then went to the
Senate Health and Welfare Committee.
However, Vasconcellos held up com
mittee work on the bill pending a Na
tional Academy of Sciences (NAS) re
port on the whole subject.
NAS released its findings in the late
summer after the Legislature had
ended its session. Under state house
rules, a previous bill can not carry over
into the new session, making this new
bill necessary.
In 1975 the senate defeated a similar
ban proposal.
"Such a ban would be a bit prema
ture." said Len Cavanagh, a program
manager in atmospheric chemistry at
the Stanford Research Institute (not
connected with the university). He
said he felt there was simply not
enough information to decide. The
NAS report recommended waiting up
to two more years while research con
tinues before implementing any regu
lations.
"The science should be completed
first, so that restrictions can be made
prudently rather than emotionally,"
said Jim Howell of the Du Pont com
pany public relations department. Du
Pont production of fluorocarbons
makes up roughly three per cent of its
total earnings or $250 million in sales.
The NAS report has been the most
comprehensive report to date, said
Howell. Compiling the work of much
previous research, NAS found that, at
1973 rates of worldwide fluorocarbon
production, the amount of ozone de
pletion in 100 years could range any
where from two per cent to 20 per cent.
Their best estimate was seven per cent.
Each percentage point drop in ozone
would lead to a two per cent increase

in skin cancer, NAS estimated.
Howell said that a two-year wait be
fore any regulations were introduced
would have a negligible effect on the
ozone layer. He added that the making
of propellant fluorocarbons has de
clined 35 to 40 per cent in the U.S.
since 1973.
Recent Du Pont research indicates
that the probable level of depletion is
less than the seven per cent per cen
tury given by NAS. The level could be
as low as 1.2 per cent, Howell said.
"I think that's bullshit," Vasconcel
los said when told of these Du Pont
estimates. "Evidence is mounting
every month."
He then referred to Sherry Rowland,
a professor at UC-Irvine. Rowland said
the latest evidence indicates that the
ozone layer is depleting at a higher rate
than seven per cent over a 100-
year period, a rate closer to 10 per cent

which would mean a 30-50 per cent
increase in skin cancer.
Rowland and Mario Molina, also at
UC-Irvine, started the entire con
troversy when they first presented the
hypothesis that fluorocarbons destroy
ozone in a June 1974 issue of Nature, a
British scientific journal.
"People like Du Pont are very good
with figures," said Vasconcellos' as
sistant Susie Lange. "No matter what
the percentages, human beings' lives
are at stake." She added, "The momen
tum is with us."
"You can study something to
death," said Dunlap's assistant Har
rington. "Enough study has been
made. It's as conclusive as you're
going to get. The time has come to act."
"This is a vitally important bill,"
said Dunlap. "The federal government
should take action. However, we must
take action ourselves." Various federal
agencies are now setting up regulatory
procedures, including the use of warn
ing labels on fluorocarbon spray cans.
The burden of proof of safety should
rest with the industry, in Harrington's
opinion. At Du Pont, Howell spoke of
this controversy as being a classic case
where industry, universities and the
federal government could work to
gether to reach scientific conclusions
and implement the necessary restric
tions.

Rowland and Mario Molina, also at
UC-Irvine, started the entire con
troversy when they first presented the
hypothesis that fluorocarbons destroy
ozone in a June 1974 issue of Nature, a
British scientific journal.
"People like Du Pont are very good
with figures," said Vasconcellos' as
sistant Susie Lange. "No matter what
the percentages, human beings' lives
are at stake." She added, "The momen
tum is with us."
"You can study something to
death," said Dunlap's assistant Har
rington. "Enough study has been
made. It's as conclusive as you're
going to get. The time has come to act."
"This is a vitally important bill,"
said Dunlap. "The federal government
should take action. However, we must
take action ourselves." Various federal
agencies are now setting up regulatory
procedures, including the use of warn
ing labels on fluorocarbon spray cans.
The burden of proof of safety should
rest with the industry, in Harrington's
opinion. At Du Pont, Howell spoke of
this controversy as being a classic case
where industry, universities and the
federal government could work to

and implement the necessary restric

A proposed ban on fluorocarbons
used in aerosol cans has received
mixed reaction in the Stanford area.
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D
-23rd) and Senator John Dunlap (D-4th)
introduced such a ban to the California
Legislature Tuesday.
"Certainly cosmetic uses could be
banned right now," said Asst. Chemis
try Prof. Robert Wallenberg. "Why not
attach a pump to the container? I agree
with a ban right now until further
studies can be made. The questions
become much tougher when we talk
about the other uses of fluorocarbons
such as refrigeration."
During the past two years a bitter
controversy has arisen over the de
teriorating effect fluorocarbons have
on the ozone layer of the Earth's upper
atmosphere. Experiments have shown
that any decrease in this layer leads to
an increase in the incidences of human

skin cancer.
If approved, the ban will begin in
January 1978. New York, Michigan
and Oregon have already enacted simi
lar legislation.
Vasconcellos said the bill had an
"excellent" chance of passing through
both the assembly and the senate. He
said he thought the bill had strong
public support.
Dunlap said that passing this legis
lation in the senate will be "a lot of
uphill work. The vested interests will
be hard at work. But yes, 1 think it will
pass."
The bill has two parts, according to
Dunlap's assistant John Harrington.
One provision would ban the sale and
manufacture of fluorocarbon propel
lents. The other would ban the sale,
manufacture and use of aerosol cans
which contain these fluorocarbons.
The assembly had approved an al

most identical bill last year, Har
rington said. The bill then went to the
Senate Health and Welfare Committee.
However, Vasconcellos held up com
mittee work on the bill pending a Na
tional Academy of Sciences (NAS) re
port on the whole subject.
NAS released its findings in the late
summer after the Legislature had
ended its session. Under state house
rules, a previous bill can not carry over
into the new session, making this new
bill necessary.
In 1975 the senate defeated a similar
ban proposal.
"Such a ban would be a bit prema
ture." said Len Cavanagh, a program
manager in atmospheric chemistry at
the Stanford Research Institute (not
connected with the university). He
said he felt there was simply not
enough information to decide. The
NAS report recommended waiting up
to two more years while research con
tinues before implementing any regu
lations.
"The science should be completed
first, so that restrictions can be made
prudently rather than emotionally,"
said Jim Howell of the Du Pont com
pany public relations department. Du
Pont production of fluorocarbons
makes up roughly three per cent of its
total earnings or $250 million in sales.
The NAS report has been the most
comprehensive report to date, said
Howell. Compiling the work of much
previous research, NAS found that, at
1973 rates of worldwide fluorocarbon
production, the amount of ozone de
pletion in 100 years could range any
where from two per cent to 20 per cent.
Their best estimate was seven per cent.
Each percentage point drop in ozone
would lead to a two per cent increase

in skin cancer, NAS estimated.
Howell said that a two-year wait be
fore any regulations were introduced
would have a negligible effect on the
ozone layer. He added that the making
of propellant fluorocarbons has de
clined 35 to 40 per cent in the U.S.
since 1973.
Recent Du Pont research indicates
that the probable level of depletion is
less than the seven per cent per cen
tury given by NAS. The level could be
as low as 1.2 per cent, Howell said.
"I think that's bullshit," Vasconcel
los said when told of these Du Pont
estimates. "Evidence is mounting
every month."
He then referred to Sherry Rowland,
a professor at UC-Irvine. Rowland said
the latest evidence indicates that the
ozone layer is depleting at a higher rate
than seven per cent over a 100-
year period, a rate closer to 10 per cent

which would mean a 30-50 per cent
increase in skin cancer.

pletion in 100 years could range any
where from two per cent to 20 per cent.
Their best estimate was seven per cent.
Each percentage point drop in ozone
would lead to a two per cent increase

in skin cancer, NAS estimated.
Howell said that a two-year wait be
fore any regulations were introduced
would have a negligible effect on the
ozone layer. He added that the making
of propellant fluorocarbons has de
clined 35 to 40 per cent in the U.S.
since 1973.
Recent Du Pont research indicates
that the probable level of depletion is
less than the seven per cent per cen
tury given by NAS. The level could be
as low as 1.2 per cent, Howell said.
"I think that's bullshit," Vasconcel
los said when told of these Du Pont
estimates. "Evidence is mounting
every month."
He then referred to Sherry Rowland,
a professor at UC-Irvine. Rowland said
the latest evidence indicates that the
ozone layer is depleting at a higher rate
than seven per cent over a 100-
year period, a rate closer to 10 per cent

which would mean a 30-50 per cent
increase in skin cancer.
Rowland and Mario Molina, also at
UC-Irvine, started the entire con
troversy when they first presented the
hypothesis that fluorocarbons destroy
ozone in a June 1974 issue of Nature, a
British scientific journal.
"People like Du Pont are very good
with figures," said Vasconcellos' as
sistant Susie Lange. "No matter what
the percentages, human beings' lives
are at stake." She added, "The momen
tum is with us."
"You can study something to
death," said Dunlap's assistant Har
rington. "Enough study has been
made. It's as conclusive as you're
going to get. The time has come to act."
"This is a vitally important bill,"
said Dunlap. "The federal government
should take action. However, we must
take action ourselves." Various federal
agencies are now setting up regulatory
procedures, including the use of warn
ing labels on fluorocarbon spray cans.
The burden of proof of safety should
rest with the industry, in Harrington's
opinion. At Du Pont, Howell spoke of
this controversy as being a classic case
where industry, universities and the
federal government could work to
gether to reach scientific conclusions
and implement the necessary restric
tions.
A proposed ban on fluorocarbons
used in aerosol cans has received
mixed reaction in the Stanford area.
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D
-23rd) and Senator John Dunlap (D-4th)
introduced such a ban to the California
Legislature Tuesday.
"Certainly cosmetic uses could be
banned right now," said Asst. Chemis
try Prof. Robert Wallenberg. "Why not
attach a pump to the container? I agree
with a ban right now until further
studies can be made. The questions
become much tougher when we talk
about the other uses of fluorocarbons
such as refrigeration."
During the past two years a bitter
controversy has arisen over the de
teriorating effect fluorocarbons have
on the ozone layer of the Earth's upper
atmosphere. Experiments have shown
that any decrease in this layer leads to
an increase in the incidences of human

skin cancer.
If approved, the ban will begin in
January 1978. New York, Michigan
and Oregon have already enacted simi
lar legislation.
Vasconcellos said the bill had an
"excellent" chance of passing through
both the assembly and the senate. He
said he thought the bill had strong
public support.
Dunlap said that passing this legis
lation in the senate will be "a lot of
uphill work. The vested interests will
be hard at work. But yes, 1 think it will
pass."
The bill has two parts, according to
Dunlap's assistant John Harrington.
One provision would ban the sale and
manufacture of fluorocarbon propel
lents. The other would ban the sale,
manufacture and use of aerosol cans
which contain these fluorocarbons.
The assembly had approved an al

most identical bill last year, Har
rington said. The bill then went to the
Senate Health and Welfare Committee.
However, Vasconcellos held up com
mittee work on the bill pending a Na
tional Academy of Sciences (NAS) re
port on the whole subject.
NAS released its findings in the late
summer after the Legislature had
ended its session. Under state house
rules, a previous bill can not carry over
into the new session, making this new
bill necessary.
In 1975 the senate defeated a similar
ban proposal.
"Such a ban would be a bit prema
ture." said Len Cavanagh, a program
manager in atmospheric chemistry at
the Stanford Research Institute (not
connected with the university). He
said he felt there was simply not
enough information to decide. The
NAS report recommended waiting up
to two more years while research con
tinues before implementing any regu
lations.
"The science should be completed
first, so that restrictions can be made
prudently rather than emotionally,"
said Jim Howell of the Du Pont com
pany public relations department. Du
Pont production of fluorocarbons
makes up roughly three per cent of its
total earnings or $250 million in sales.
The NAS report has been the most
comprehensive report to date, said
Howell. Compiling the work of much
previous research, NAS found that, at
1973 rates of worldwide fluorocarbon
production, the amount of ozone de
pletion in 100 years could range any
where from two per cent to 20 per cent.
Their best estimate was seven per cent.
