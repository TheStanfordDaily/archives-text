## Opinions Delts merit reinstatement 
### 
George Anders

Imagine this. It is 1972, a few
months after English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin has incited students to vio
lence. In addition to firing Franklin,
the university has suspended the En
glish Department for three years.
Buildings 40 and 50 of the Quad
have been turned over to other de
partments. Some English profs have
found offices elsewhere on campus;
others have regrouped in Palo Alto and
Mountain View. Now, midway
through their first year of suspension,
English Department members have
petitioned the university for
reinstatement.
Farfetched? Yes. But that scenario
parallels the current position of Delta
Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity here.
It's too late to question the original
suspension of the Delts. But with Jim
Lyons, dean of student affairs, due to
decide soon on whether to reinstate
the Delts, it's time to appraise the
merits of reinstatement.
Vandalism
Last summer, four Delt residents
were given one- to three-quarter sus
pensions as punishment for vandalism
the night of May 19, 1976. According
to Eric Grunseth, Delt president, all but
one of those individuals will have
graduated by next fall. The other one
was a boarder last spring and would
not be living in the house anyway,
Grunseth said.
So if the Delts were reinstated, none
of the principal offenders would be
back. Those who are hoping to return
not only have clean records but have
worked hard on constructive activities
for their fraternity.
This fall, Delts organized a canned
food drive. They are planning to offer

sports clinics to nearby orphanages
this spring. Even without a house,
Delts have continued to meet on Wed
nesday nights.
When Lyons decides on reinstate
ment, these factors are bound to have
an influence. His decision, which will
draw on recommendations from others
in the Dean of Student Affairs Office,
will be based on how well the Delts
have met criteria such as having regu
lar meetings and spending funds for
"programs of general educational
merit."
Incorrigible
In fact, it's well nigh impossible to
justify continued suspension in light
of the Delts' record this academic year.
But many who argue against reinstat
ing the Delts contend that we are being
deceived. Delts are incorrigible, these
persons say, and point to a previous
suspension of the chapter here as
"proof."
These arguments are self-refuting.
Individual Delts just don't measure up
to stories about Delt atrocities which
persons who have never set foot inside
the Delt house are so fond of telling.
Part of the problem is that Delta Tau
Delta is the most noticed fraternity
here. Some of its members are football
players, others have varsity letters in
other sports.
In a June 20, 1976 letter to former
Delt president Kevin McDermott,
Lyons insisted that Delta Tau Delta
wasn't being treated differently from
other fraternities. I'm doubtful.
Members of other fraternities here
have hurled a case of beer bottles onto
a much-traveled road below, taken aim
with bottle rockets at unwanted vis
itors and performed other acts of mis-

chief which have yet to draw any dis
ciplinary action from the university.
Singled out
If the Delts are being singled out be
cause of a concern over the perils of a
football frat it's not an especially pres
sing concern.
The Delts have always consisted of
non-football players as well as football
players. Next fall, only four of 16 re
turning Delts will be football players,
according to Grunseth. The fraternity
will be seeking to rush a diversified
group of pledges, he said.
Fraternities do change. Ten years
ago, the Delts weren't a football frat. It
doesn't look like there will be many
football players in the fraternity this
coming fall.
Besides, it's safer to let football
players live together than to have Mel
ville scholars working together in the
same department. Now that would be
dangerous.

have hurled a case of beer bottles onto
a much-traveled road below, taken aim

Singled out
If the Delts are being singled out be
cause of a concern over the perils of a
football frat it's not an especially pres
sing concern.
The Delts have always consisted of
non-football players as well as football
players. Next fall, only four of 16 re
turning Delts will be football players,
according to Grunseth. The fraternity
will be seeking to rush a diversified
group of pledges, he said.
Fraternities do change. Ten years
ago, the Delts weren't a football frat. It
doesn't look like there will be many
football players in the fraternity this
coming fall.
Besides, it's safer to let football
players live together than to have Mel
ville scholars working together in the
same department. Now that would be
dangerous.

Imagine this. It is 1972, a few
months after English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin has incited students to vio
lence. In addition to firing Franklin,
the university has suspended the En
glish Department for three years.
Buildings 40 and 50 of the Quad
have been turned over to other de
partments. Some English profs have
found offices elsewhere on campus;
others have regrouped in Palo Alto and
Mountain View. Now, midway
through their first year of suspension,
English Department members have
petitioned the university for
reinstatement.
Farfetched? Yes. But that scenario
parallels the current position of Delta
Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity here.
It's too late to question the original
suspension of the Delts. But with Jim
Lyons, dean of student affairs, due to
decide soon on whether to reinstate
the Delts, it's time to appraise the
merits of reinstatement.
Vandalism
Last summer, four Delt residents
were given one- to three-quarter sus
pensions as punishment for vandalism
the night of May 19, 1976. According
to Eric Grunseth, Delt president, all but
one of those individuals will have
graduated by next fall. The other one
was a boarder last spring and would
not be living in the house anyway,
Grunseth said.
So if the Delts were reinstated, none
of the principal offenders would be
back. Those who are hoping to return
not only have clean records but have
worked hard on constructive activities
for their fraternity.
This fall, Delts organized a canned
food drive. They are planning to offer

sports clinics to nearby orphanages
this spring. Even without a house,
Delts have continued to meet on Wed
nesday nights.
When Lyons decides on reinstate
ment, these factors are bound to have
an influence. His decision, which will
draw on recommendations from others
in the Dean of Student Affairs Office,
will be based on how well the Delts
have met criteria such as having regu
lar meetings and spending funds for
"programs of general educational
merit."
Incorrigible
In fact, it's well nigh impossible to
justify continued suspension in light
of the Delts' record this academic year.
But many who argue against reinstat
ing the Delts contend that we are being
deceived. Delts are incorrigible, these
persons say, and point to a previous
suspension of the chapter here as
"proof."
These arguments are self-refuting.
Individual Delts just don't measure up
to stories about Delt atrocities which
persons who have never set foot inside
the Delt house are so fond of telling.
Part of the problem is that Delta Tau
Delta is the most noticed fraternity
here. Some of its members are football
players, others have varsity letters in
other sports.
In a June 20, 1976 letter to former
Delt president Kevin McDermott,
Lyons insisted that Delta Tau Delta
wasn't being treated differently from
other fraternities. I'm doubtful.
Members of other fraternities here
have hurled a case of beer bottles onto
