# Protest 'Bakke'

### 
Briones, Zuniga

Thrfrecent Supreme Court ruling on
the Bakke decision raises serious ques
tions about the worth of special minor
ity admissions in public and private
universities.
The creation of special admissions
programs was a result of the civil
rights movements of the late '60s. The
initiation of those programs was only a
compromise which, by admitting
minority students, offered a temporary
and limited solution to past discrimi
nation.
The Bakke decision, if allowed to
stand, would promulgate a massive re
treat to the days of complete minority
exclusion in colleges and universities.
In view of this, the recent statewide
conference of the Coalition Against the
Bakke Decision (CABD) adopted nine
demands which includethefollowing:
—Reverse the Bakke decision
—Proportional representation in
admission and hiring of minorities
—Defend and extend minority ad
missions
—No more cutbacks in minorities'
programs
—Increase of funds and control to
minorities.
These demands directly attack those
structures and values which per
petuate racism and discrimination in

herent in educational institutions.
Students in both public and private
universities throughout the state are
presently organizing on their cam
puses to make these demands known.
The CABD chapter here sees a need
to examine Stanford's admissions pol
icy and to advocate structural change.
Stanford has no students, minority or
otherwise, involved in its admissions
process.
Admissions criteria are strongly
based upon culturally and class biased
entrance exams which have been
proven to be poor determinants of
low-income and minority applicants'
qualifications.
Furthermore, the lessening of Stan
ford's commitment to minorities is
evidenced by the financial aid cut
backs in 1975 and the fact that Stan
ford's present minority enrollement is
the lowest since 1972.
The ramifications of the Bakke deci
sion are widespread and disastrous. It
is time to demand that the rights of
low-income and minority students to
higher education be upheld and no
more compromises be made.
