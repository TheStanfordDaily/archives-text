# ACLU mistreated Gilmore
## 
### 
Paul Bauman

It is a sad comment that, of all those involved in the Gary
Gilmore execution controversy, the person who behaved
most rationally was the convicted murderer himself.
Gilmore, who was executed Monday for the murder of a
Provo, Utah motel clerk last summer, admitted he acted
senselessly and he clearly indicated that he was willing to
accept the consequences, in this case death.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and vari
ous courts, on the other hand, disregarded Utah state law,
disregarded Gilmore's wish and obligation to die, and
embarked on a personal crusade against the death penalty.
The eternally altruistic ACLU, in its usual song-and
dance routine, contended that the death penalty consti
tutes "cruel and unusual punishment" and is therefore
unconstitutional. But currently, capital punishment in
Utah is perfectly legal.
Sit in his cell
"Cruel and unusual punishment" is mentally torturing
Gilmore by forcing him to sit in his cell for months with
his fate undecided. This is what ACLU attorneys did by
repeatedly arranging execution postponements. Just
when Gilmore had mentally prepared himself to die. the
ACLU stepped in and persuaded the courts to give him
another 30-60 days to contemplate death.
To me, the words "civil liberties" in "American Civil
Liberties Union" connote freedom of the people, respon
sibility for one's actions and acceptance of the consequ
ences. These were the rules by which Gilmore and Utah
played.
By interfering, the ACLU was saying, in effect, that it
knew what was best for Gary Gilmore, better than Gary
Gilmore did — a blatant case of hypocrisy. Apparently, the
ACLU supports "civil liberties" only when they don't
offend its sensibilities.
As for the courts, Gilmore hit it right on the nose when
he called two judges who had postponed one of his execu

tion dates "moral cowards." They didn't have the strength
to see that the prescribed punishment was administered.
End the pretense
If we're going to have the death penalty, we should use
it. If we don't want to use it, we should wipe it off the
books and end the pretense of a functional capital
punishment law.
Let's be honest. The ultimate concern of the courts and
of the ACLU in the Gilmore affair was not civil rights, as
they dearly want us to believe. It was to avoid the pain of
an execution by the government on their vulnerable con
sciences. Personally, I wouldn't want it on my conscience
that I fought for the life of a murderer.
It's ironic that Gilmore could accept the death penalty,
but the ACLU couldn't.
Opponents of capital punishment should actually be
encouraged by the Gilmore case. If a convicted killer in an
ultra-conservative Mormon state who wanted to die had
so much trouble being executed, it's unlikely that anyone
anywhere else will be.
Californians ought to know. In a 1972 state-wide re
ferendum, voters overwhelmingly supported the death
penalty, a mandate which Gov. Jerry Brown has ignored
because he opposes capital punishment.
I must admit that I write all this with a bit of apprehen
sion. Writing these views at Stanford is somewhat like
waving a communist flag in front of the Pentagon. That is
to say that I don't think my rather conservative opinions
are going to go over too well among the liberal student
body here.
No matter. Your rebuttals probably nauseate me as
much as this nauseates you. But lest you get the idea that
I'm a right-wing Archie Bunker-type. I voted for Jimmy
Carter and I like Peter Frampton.

The eternally altruistic ACLU, in its usual song-and
dance routine, contended that the death penalty consti
tutes "cruel and unusual punishment" and is therefore
unconstitutional. But currently, capital punishment in
Utah is perfectly legal.
Sit in his cell
"Cruel and unusual punishment" is mentally torturing
Gilmore by forcing him to sit in his cell for months with
his fate undecided. This is what ACLU attorneys did by
repeatedly arranging execution postponements. Just
when Gilmore had mentally prepared himself to die. the
ACLU stepped in and persuaded the courts to give him
another 30-60 days to contemplate death.
To me, the words "civil liberties" in "American Civil
Liberties Union" connote freedom of the people, respon
sibility for one's actions and acceptance of the consequ
ences. These were the rules by which Gilmore and Utah
played.
By interfering, the ACLU was saying, in effect, that it
knew what was best for Gary Gilmore, better than Gary
Gilmore did — a blatant case of hypocrisy. Apparently, the
ACLU supports "civil liberties" only when they don't
offend its sensibilities.
As for the courts, Gilmore hit it right on the nose when
he called two judges who had postponed one of his execu

tion dates "moral cowards." They didn't have the strength
to see that the prescribed punishment was administered.
End the pretense
If we're going to have the death penalty, we should use
it. If we don't want to use it, we should wipe it off the
books and end the pretense of a functional capital
punishment law.
Let's be honest. The ultimate concern of the courts and
of the ACLU in the Gilmore affair was not civil rights, as
they dearly want us to believe. It was to avoid the pain of
an execution by the government on their vulnerable con
sciences. Personally, I wouldn't want it on my conscience
that I fought for the life of a murderer.
It's ironic that Gilmore could accept the death penalty,
but the ACLU couldn't.
Opponents of capital punishment should actually be
encouraged by the Gilmore case. If a convicted killer in an
ultra-conservative Mormon state who wanted to die had
so much trouble being executed, it's unlikely that anyone
anywhere else will be.
Californians ought to know. In a 1972 state-wide re
ferendum, voters overwhelmingly supported the death
penalty, a mandate which Gov. Jerry Brown has ignored
because he opposes capital punishment.
I must admit that I write all this with a bit of apprehen
sion. Writing these views at Stanford is somewhat like
waving a communist flag in front of the Pentagon. That is
to say that I don't think my rather conservative opinions
are going to go over too well among the liberal student
body here.
No matter. Your rebuttals probably nauseate me as
much as this nauseates you. But lest you get the idea that
I'm a right-wing Archie Bunker-type. I voted for Jimmy
Carter and I like Peter Frampton.

It is a sad comment that, of all those involved in the Gary
Gilmore execution controversy, the person who behaved
most rationally was the convicted murderer himself.
Gilmore, who was executed Monday for the murder of a
Provo, Utah motel clerk last summer, admitted he acted
senselessly and he clearly indicated that he was willing to
accept the consequences, in this case death.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and vari
ous courts, on the other hand, disregarded Utah state law,
disregarded Gilmore's wish and obligation to die, and
embarked on a personal crusade against the death penalty.
