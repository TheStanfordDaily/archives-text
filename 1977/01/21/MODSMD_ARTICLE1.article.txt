# Carter: friend of big biz?

### Marc Strassman Last of five parts 
What may appear to be inconsisten
cies in Jimmy Carter's political be
havior and personal character may ac
tually reflect a combination of two
strong American ideals.
Underestimating the subtlety of his
approach to governing may be just as
big a mistake for those seeking to un
derstand his presidency as undere
stimating the subtlety of his approach
to campaigning was for those who
sought to deny him the Democratic
nomination.
What appears to be the most impor
tant ambivalence in his actions until
now resides in the conflict between his
respect for and deference to the wishes
of the American business community
evidenced by many of his major ap
pointments and tentative policies and
his small town agrarian populism.
In his acceptance speech at the
Democratic convention this July, heat
tacked "big-shots" who commit
crimes without going to jail, and those
who send their children to private
schools.
Other motives
It may be however, that Carter's pre
sent efforts to establish good relations
with the business community repre
sent more than an attempt to create the
healthy economic environment he will
need in order to implement the social
programs he has promised.

Carter had mentioned often during
the campaign that he was a naval of
ficer, farmer, businessman and politi
cian. In each of these occupations he
applied his intelligence and ambition
and succeeded in achieving signific
ant results for himself and the institu
tion within which he was working.
Perhaps the most important things
he learned were the same two possibly
contradictory principles that lie at the
heart of American civilization — effi
ciency counts above all else and per
sons come first.
Pragmatism vs. populism
This conflict between pragmatism
and populism lies both at the heart of
the contemporary American dilemma
and in Carter's personality and there
fore will appear frequently in his
statements and actions.
Furthermore, it will be through his
ability to reconcile and integrate these
two tendencies that he will achieve
success as president, if he does achieve
success.
Carter's populist feelings, derived
from his smalltown origins and rela
tively humble family status, are real.
So is his respect for what can be ac
complished through the advanced
technology and sophisticated man
agement techniques he later encoun
tered in the larger world of the United
States Navy, as a state senator and gov
ernor in Atlanta. While he apparently
does not approve of the tendency to

wards greed and self-aggrandizement
that often is part of the corporate men
tality, he does seem to appreciate the
power of commorcial methods and
techniques.
Balancing act
It seems likely, then, tha* his actions
as president will be characterized by
efforts to make the fullest possible use,
both within his administration and in
terms of larger national policies, of the
pragmatic and efficient aspects of
American business while simultane
ously trying to minimize the influence
of its self-seeking and avaracious ten
dencies.
This is why Carter's corporation
officer-dominated cabinet and his pos
ition against even stand-by wage and
price controls may not necessarily
contradict his call for a "people's in
augural" and his plans to visit around
the country to meet ordinary people on
a regular basis.
Carter, who is undeniably ambiti
ous, now says that his ambition is to be
"a great president." In order to do that,
he must make real progress in solving
the country's pressing economic and
social problems.
This will require the willing cooper
ation of corporate America. It will also
necessarily require that the major
decision-makers of corporate America
put aside some of their desires for more
and more personal aggrandizement.

tality, he does seem to appreciate the
power of commorcial methods and
techniques.
Balancing act
It seems likely, then, tha* his actions
as president will be characterized by
efforts to make the fullest possible use,
both within his administration and in
terms of larger national policies, of the
pragmatic and efficient aspects of
American business while simultane
ously trying to minimize the influence
of its self-seeking and avaracious ten
dencies.
This is why Carter's corporation
officer-dominated cabinet and his pos
ition against even stand-by wage and
price controls may not necessarily
contradict his call for a "people's in
augural" and his plans to visit around
the country to meet ordinary people on
a regular basis.
Carter, who is undeniably ambiti
ous, now says that his ambition is to be
"a great president." In order to do that,
he must make real progress in solving
the country's pressing economic and
social problems.
This will require the willing cooper
ation of corporate America. It will also
necessarily require that the major
decision-makers of corporate America
put aside some of their desires for more
and more personal aggrandizement.

What may appear to be inconsisten
cies in Jimmy Carter's political be
havior and personal character may ac
tually reflect a combination of two
strong American ideals.
Underestimating the subtlety of his
approach to governing may be just as
big a mistake for those seeking to un
derstand his presidency as undere
stimating the subtlety of his approach
to campaigning was for those who
sought to deny him the Democratic
nomination.
What appears to be the most impor
tant ambivalence in his actions until
now resides in the conflict between his
respect for and deference to the wishes
of the American business community
evidenced by many of his major ap
pointments and tentative policies and
his small town agrarian populism.
In his acceptance speech at the
Democratic convention this July, heat
tacked "big-shots" who commit
crimes without going to jail, and those
who send their children to private
schools.
Other motives
It may be however, that Carter's pre
sent efforts to establish good relations
with the business community repre
sent more than an attempt to create the
healthy economic environment he will
need in order to implement the social
programs he has promised.

Carter had mentioned often during
the campaign that he was a naval of
ficer, farmer, businessman and politi
cian. In each of these occupations he
applied his intelligence and ambition
and succeeded in achieving signific
ant results for himself and the institu
tion within which he was working.
Perhaps the most important things
he learned were the same two possibly
contradictory principles that lie at the
heart of American civilization — effi
ciency counts above all else and per
sons come first.
Pragmatism vs. populism
This conflict between pragmatism
and populism lies both at the heart of
the contemporary American dilemma
and in Carter's personality and there
fore will appear frequently in his
statements and actions.
Furthermore, it will be through his
ability to reconcile and integrate these
two tendencies that he will achieve
success as president, if he does achieve
success.
Carter's populist feelings, derived
from his smalltown origins and rela
tively humble family status, are real.
So is his respect for what can be ac
complished through the advanced
technology and sophisticated man
agement techniques he later encoun
tered in the larger world of the United
States Navy, as a state senator and gov
ernor in Atlanta. While he apparently
does not approve of the tendency to

wards greed and self-aggrandizement
that often is part of the corporate men
tality, he does seem to appreciate the
power of commorcial methods and
techniques.
