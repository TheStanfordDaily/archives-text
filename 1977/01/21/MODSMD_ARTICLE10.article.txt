# Criteria for theme houses needed

I find myself at odds with parts of the
Daily editorial of Jan. 18.
The editorial does suggest the sus
picious motivation of the administra
tion in instituting the most recent
themes, American Studies and Italian
Studies, within the most aesthetically
pleasing and functionally useful hous
ing units presently on campus. Placing
the programs associated with those
themes in those settings insure their
acceptance by the students and con
sequently guarantee that those in
volved in the programs' formulation
will be awarded a gold star for their
success in implementing the concept
of residential education.
Excluding students who are paying
equivalent amounts for room and
board on the basis of their lack of intel
lectual curiosity, or at least their disin
terest in narrow substantive themes is
patently unfair. After all, Stanford is a
school of pre-meds and engineers
many of whose intellectual interests
differ sharply from those focused on in
the American Studies House and the
Italian Studies House.
Should the Androgyny House, with
a radical orientation rather than a trad
itional academic focus, be incorpo
rated into the housing system, it will
be enlightening to observe which facil
ity is occupied.
What I cannot accept is the Daily's

position that only theme houses re
volving about substantive academic
and cultural programs should be al
lowed to survive.
The Stanford student is a socially,
religiously, politically, sexually, cul
turally and intellectually oriented
being who must be allowed an outlet
and opportunity to develop in all those
modes.
Occasionally, optimal development
can only be fostered in those areas in a
group living situation where the at
mosphere is conducive to the ex
change a nd espousal of ideas as well as
the facilitation of concerted group ef
fort and communal experience.
It is imperative that the university
recognize other than traditional intel
lectual pursuits because of its
monopolistic position as a provider of
student housing. Stanford students,
such as those advocating the An
drogyny House, are unable to organize
outside of the university's auspices
without incurring the gross incon
venience which arises from living off
campus.
If there were a student ghetto con
tiguous to the Stanford campus the
dean of student affairs would possibly
be justified in summarily rejecting any
proposals for those houses not con
fined to narrow intellectual pursuits.
Such is not the case.

Arguably, Jane Lathrop Stanford
herself envisioned the formation of
student housing units focused on di
verse interests. In the 1899 amend
ments to the deed of grant on which
the university was founded she stated.
"It is desirable that the members of the
Faculty and the students should gen
erally reside on the grounds of the
University."
She continued, providing that
"Societies or associations of students
shall be permitted to build houses for
the use of members of the societies or
associations respectively." The most
conspicuous example of these
societies today are the fraternities. Cer
tainly, nobody would assert that
fraternities survive in the housing sys
tem due to their commitment to intel
lectual and cultural pursuits.
The only criteria that the dean of

student affairs should consider in de
termining whether to institute or re
tain a theme house are: 1) Is there suffi
cient student interest and will this in
terest be sustained over a period of
time sufficiently long enough to justify
the use of scarce university resources
in the program's formulation and op
eration; 2)ls a group living situation
significantly useful in achieving the
goals suggested by the theme.
Prejudice towards the content of
ideological themes is irrelevant when
these criteria are applied. Conscien
tious application of the criteria avoids
the misallocation of housing based on
student needs.
I am confident that Norm Robinson
and James Lyons could sagaciously
apply such standards.

student.)
