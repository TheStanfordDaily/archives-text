## Diebenkorn and the monotype 
### Katherine Draznin 
The current exhibit of Richard
Diebenkorn's monotypes at the
Stanford Museum should be of
special interest to the Stanford
community. Not only is Dieben
korn a Stanford graduate (class
of '49), and a former artist-in
residence (1963-4), but the
majority of monotypes were exe
cuted at Stanford under the aegis
of Nathan Oliveira, professor of
Art here. Beyond all that, the
exhibit provides a particularly
compelling view of Dieben
korn's "process" and method of
painting.
Although Diebenkorn does
not consider himself a
printmaker, he decided to
explore the monotype medium,
which had had a recent revival at
Stanford under Oliveira, when
he received two catalogues of
monotypes by Degas and Goya
from Oliveira.
Diebenkorn's first prints were
executed in Santa Monica,
California, in spring of 1974, and
a second series, shown in its en
tirety in this exhibit, was created
during a weekend visit to Stan
ford in April, 1975.
Monotype, or monoprint, is a
modified form of printmaking.
The artist cannot generate an
edition of prints of the same im
age, but uses a plate for its spe
cial qualities. The image is
applied by rag, brush, hand, or
any other means to a flat metal or
glass plate, using various prin
ters' inks or paint.
The plate will generate one
fully saturated print, but a ghost
image will remain. This "pen
timento" can be exploited for the
next print or wiped clean. Cer
tain subtle tones which could
not be otherwise achieved are
possible through this degenera
tion of the ink density.
Relentless self-criticism
Diebenkorn is relentless in his
self-criticism, and normally
meticulous about editing his
works for a show. He will not
hesitate to destroy a canvas, no
matter how much work has gone
into it, if it does not seem suc
cessful to him. This exhibit is
thus doubly unique since
monotype is a relatively "new"
medium for the artist, and he has
al lowed all of the prints from the
Stanford series to be displayed
despite what he might consider
to be flaws. The Santa Monica

Series was edited from 36 to 11
prints.
Diebenkorn is best known for
his Ocean Park paintings, begun
in the 1960's in Santa Monica.
The title derives from the loca
tion of his studio, and under
scores the influence of the land
scape. the studio environment,
and the light in his work. The
canvases, which are quite large,
were worked out through a long
process, beginning with draw
ing with charcoal or graphite di
rectly onto the canvas. The ini
tial image might be erased, or
reworked, and gradually, color
would be added and balanced.
At times, Diebenkorn has com
pletely repainted a canvas in a
day, totally reworking the im
age.
Diebenkorn develops a
dialogue with his works. Al
though his paintings are
abstract, and perhaps initially
remote to he has in
vested each canvas with a great
deal of his personality. Critic
John Russell wrote, "The Ocean
Park paintings are the record,
full and true, of one man's
negotiations with painting.
Nowhere is there a dull or
thoughtless or conventional
mark. To spend a morning in
such company is to prize, all
over again, the dignity of paint
ing."
Dialogue
It is Diebenkorn's dialogue
that makes the monotypes excit
ing, as well as making them
small revelations of his earlier
works. As one follows a series,
the images transform, and are
"corrected," yet many of the
prints are complete by them
selves. There is no dependence
upon serial imagery.
The Stanford 4-11-75 series
generated 13 prints, beginning
with a black club shape that ap
pears as a ghost in subsequent
images. Then. Diebenkorn
breaks into variations upon
themes explored in the Ocean
Park series. Geometric forms are
balanced, then reassembled
until one reaches the final print
where a minimum amount of
black remains, and large white
forms that have evolved through
the last five prints dominate the
print.
The quality of the ink in the
Stanford prints added a richness
that was not present in the more

subtle and austere grays of the
Santa Monica series. Inks were
limited to black, which degener
ated into various grays, and a
rare umber and blue. Diebenkorn
did not hesitate to reverse the
plate, to alternate between sharp
and exact lines, washes,
splotches, brushed lines or
fields, and handworked areas
that contained finger and palm
prints. The ink attains a velvet
texture in some areas, and is
speckled or washed thin in
others.
Diebenkorn wrote, in 1957,
"All paintings start out of a
mood, out of a relationship with
things or people, out of complete
visual impression. To call this
impression abstract seems to me
often to confuse the issue.
Abstract means literally to draw
from or separate. In this sense
every artist is abstract, for he
must create his own work from
his visual impressions. A realis
tic or non-objective approach
makes no difference. The result
is what counts." Diebenkorn
studied in the 1950's with mem
bers of the figurative school, but
returned to abstraction to allow
himself "to follow the painting
in terms of just what 1 want for
the painting as opposed to the
qualifying that I found 1 had to
do in figure painting."
Yet it is still surprising to find
that the sparse visual language
afforded by a black and white
monoprint could produce rich
and compelling imagery.
Diebenkorn pushed beyond the
more cerebral and less open
Santa Monica prints to a richer,
more varied, and organic lan
guage in the Stanford series. The

Stanford series strikes one as
good fun, perhaps because of the
vigor of the metamorphosis. A
humorous note is left on one
Stanford print, underscoring
what was weak in the earlier
works; "Take a good look. Dick
this is a bloody formula." The
origin of this message remains as
enigmatic as the subtle varia
tions in the Stanford series, but
the statement provided a light
touch to an otherwise serious
undertaking.
Permanent selections
The exhibit was assembled at
UCLA by Gerald Nordland,
Director of the Frederick S.
Wight Art Gallery. An excerpt
from the show's catalog,
which includes a critical essay
by Nordland, provides adequate
background for those unfamiliar
with the artist or the art form.
The museum also plans to dis
play a number of Diebenkorn's
drawings from the permanent
collection in the contemporary
section of the museum. A special
Tuesday luncheon tour of the
exhibit is scheduled for Feb.
1 at 12:15 p.m.
This is an excellent exhibit for
those acquainted with Dieben
korn's art as well as for those
who are not. The monoprint
technique has been reinvigo
rated by his willingness to re
work imagery, subjecting it to
thoughtful consideration, and
especially by his willingness to
show his process from begin
ning to completion. The result is
what counts.
The Diebenkorn exhibit will
continue through March 20. The
Stanford Museum is open week
days except Mondays from 10
a.m. to' 4:45 p.m., and on
weekends from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

during a weekend visit to Stan
ford in April, 1975.
Monotype, or monoprint, is a
modified form of printmaking.
The artist cannot generate an
edition of prints of the same im
age, but uses a plate for its spe
cial qualities. The image is
applied by rag, brush, hand, or
any other means to a flat metal or
glass plate, using various prin
ters' inks or paint.
The plate will generate one
fully saturated print, but a ghost
image will remain. This "pen
timento" can be exploited for the
next print or wiped clean. Cer
tain subtle tones which could
not be otherwise achieved are
possible through this degenera
tion of the ink density.
Relentless self-criticism
Diebenkorn is relentless in his
self-criticism, and normally
meticulous about editing his
works for a show. He will not
hesitate to destroy a canvas, no
matter how much work has gone
into it, if it does not seem suc
cessful to him. This exhibit is
thus doubly unique since
monotype is a relatively "new"
medium for the artist, and he has
al lowed all of the prints from the
Stanford series to be displayed
despite what he might consider
to be flaws. The Santa Monica

Series was edited from 36 to 11
prints.
Diebenkorn is best known for
his Ocean Park paintings, begun
in the 1960's in Santa Monica.
The title derives from the loca
tion of his studio, and under
scores the influence of the land
scape. the studio environment,
and the light in his work. The
canvases, which are quite large,
were worked out through a long
process, beginning with draw
ing with charcoal or graphite di
rectly onto the canvas. The ini
tial image might be erased, or
reworked, and gradually, color
would be added and balanced.
At times, Diebenkorn has com
pletely repainted a canvas in a
day, totally reworking the im
age.
Diebenkorn develops a
dialogue with his works. Al
though his paintings are
abstract, and perhaps initially
remote to he has in
vested each canvas with a great
deal of his personality. Critic
John Russell wrote, "The Ocean
Park paintings are the record,
full and true, of one man's
negotiations with painting.
Nowhere is there a dull or
thoughtless or conventional
mark. To spend a morning in
such company is to prize, all
over again, the dignity of paint
ing."
Dialogue
It is Diebenkorn's dialogue
that makes the monotypes excit
ing, as well as making them
small revelations of his earlier
works. As one follows a series,
the images transform, and are
"corrected," yet many of the
prints are complete by them
selves. There is no dependence
upon serial imagery.
The Stanford 4-11-75 series
generated 13 prints, beginning
with a black club shape that ap
pears as a ghost in subsequent
images. Then. Diebenkorn
breaks into variations upon
themes explored in the Ocean
Park series. Geometric forms are
balanced, then reassembled
until one reaches the final print
where a minimum amount of
black remains, and large white
forms that have evolved through
the last five prints dominate the
print.
The quality of the ink in the
Stanford prints added a richness
that was not present in the more

subtle and austere grays of the
Santa Monica series. Inks were
limited to black, which degener
ated into various grays, and a
rare umber and blue. Diebenkorn
did not hesitate to reverse the
plate, to alternate between sharp
and exact lines, washes,
splotches, brushed lines or
fields, and handworked areas
that contained finger and palm
prints. The ink attains a velvet
texture in some areas, and is
speckled or washed thin in
others.
Diebenkorn wrote, in 1957,
"All paintings start out of a
mood, out of a relationship with
things or people, out of complete
visual impression. To call this
impression abstract seems to me
often to confuse the issue.
Abstract means literally to draw
from or separate. In this sense
every artist is abstract, for he
must create his own work from
his visual impressions. A realis
tic or non-objective approach
makes no difference. The result
is what counts." Diebenkorn
studied in the 1950's with mem
bers of the figurative school, but
returned to abstraction to allow
himself "to follow the painting
in terms of just what 1 want for
the painting as opposed to the
qualifying that I found 1 had to
do in figure painting."
Yet it is still surprising to find
that the sparse visual language
afforded by a black and white
monoprint could produce rich
and compelling imagery.
Diebenkorn pushed beyond the
more cerebral and less open
Santa Monica prints to a richer,
more varied, and organic lan
guage in the Stanford series. The

Stanford series strikes one as
good fun, perhaps because of the
vigor of the metamorphosis. A
humorous note is left on one
Stanford print, underscoring
what was weak in the earlier
works; "Take a good look. Dick
this is a bloody formula." The
origin of this message remains as
enigmatic as the subtle varia
tions in the Stanford series, but
the statement provided a light
touch to an otherwise serious
undertaking.
Permanent selections
The exhibit was assembled at
UCLA by Gerald Nordland,
Director of the Frederick S.
Wight Art Gallery. An excerpt
from the show's catalog,
which includes a critical essay
by Nordland, provides adequate
background for those unfamiliar
with the artist or the art form.
The museum also plans to dis
play a number of Diebenkorn's
drawings from the permanent
collection in the contemporary
section of the museum. A special
Tuesday luncheon tour of the
exhibit is scheduled for Feb.
1 at 12:15 p.m.
This is an excellent exhibit for
those acquainted with Dieben
korn's art as well as for those
who are not. The monoprint
technique has been reinvigo
rated by his willingness to re
work imagery, subjecting it to
thoughtful consideration, and
especially by his willingness to
show his process from begin
ning to completion. The result is
what counts.
The Diebenkorn exhibit will
continue through March 20. The
Stanford Museum is open week
days except Mondays from 10

weekends from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

The current exhibit of Richard
Diebenkorn's monotypes at the
Stanford Museum should be of
special interest to the Stanford
community. Not only is Dieben
korn a Stanford graduate (class
of '49), and a former artist-in
residence (1963-4), but the
majority of monotypes were exe
cuted at Stanford under the aegis
of Nathan Oliveira, professor of
Art here. Beyond all that, the
exhibit provides a particularly
compelling view of Dieben
korn's "process" and method of
painting.
Although Diebenkorn does
not consider himself a
printmaker, he decided to
explore the monotype medium,
which had had a recent revival at
Stanford under Oliveira, when
he received two catalogues of
monotypes by Degas and Goya
from Oliveira.
Diebenkorn's first prints were
executed in Santa Monica,
California, in spring of 1974, and
a second series, shown in its en

thus doubly unique since
monotype is a relatively "new"
medium for the artist, and he has
al lowed all of the prints from the
Stanford series to be displayed
despite what he might consider
to be flaws. The Santa Monica

Series was edited from 36 to 11
prints.
Diebenkorn is best known for
his Ocean Park paintings, begun
in the 1960's in Santa Monica.
The title derives from the loca
tion of his studio, and under
scores the influence of the land
scape. the studio environment,
and the light in his work. The
canvases, which are quite large,
were worked out through a long
process, beginning with draw
ing with charcoal or graphite di
rectly onto the canvas. The ini
tial image might be erased, or
reworked, and gradually, color
would be added and balanced.
At times, Diebenkorn has com
pletely repainted a canvas in a
day, totally reworking the im
age.
Diebenkorn develops a
dialogue with his works. Al
though his paintings are
abstract, and perhaps initially
remote to he has in
vested each canvas with a great
deal of his personality. Critic
John Russell wrote, "The Ocean
Park paintings are the record,
full and true, of one man's
negotiations with painting.
Nowhere is there a dull or
thoughtless or conventional
mark. To spend a morning in
such company is to prize, all
over again, the dignity of paint
ing."
Dialogue
It is Diebenkorn's dialogue
that makes the monotypes excit
ing, as well as making them
small revelations of his earlier
works. As one follows a series,
the images transform, and are
"corrected," yet many of the
prints are complete by them
selves. There is no dependence
upon serial imagery.
The Stanford 4-11-75 series
generated 13 prints, beginning
with a black club shape that ap
pears as a ghost in subsequent
images. Then. Diebenkorn
breaks into variations upon
themes explored in the Ocean
Park series. Geometric forms are
balanced, then reassembled
until one reaches the final print
where a minimum amount of
black remains, and large white
forms that have evolved through
the last five prints dominate the
print.
The quality of the ink in the
Stanford prints added a richness
that was not present in the more

subtle and austere grays of the
Santa Monica series. Inks were
limited to black, which degener
ated into various grays, and a
rare umber and blue. Diebenkorn
did not hesitate to reverse the
plate, to alternate between sharp
and exact lines, washes,
splotches, brushed lines or
fields, and handworked areas
that contained finger and palm
prints. The ink attains a velvet
texture in some areas, and is
speckled or washed thin in
others.
Diebenkorn wrote, in 1957,
"All paintings start out of a
mood, out of a relationship with
things or people, out of complete
visual impression. To call this
impression abstract seems to me
often to confuse the issue.
Abstract means literally to draw
from or separate. In this sense
every artist is abstract, for he
must create his own work from
his visual impressions. A realis
tic or non-objective approach
makes no difference. The result
is what counts." Diebenkorn
studied in the 1950's with mem
bers of the figurative school, but
returned to abstraction to allow
himself "to follow the painting
in terms of just what 1 want for
the painting as opposed to the
qualifying that I found 1 had to
do in figure painting."
Yet it is still surprising to find
that the sparse visual language
afforded by a black and white
monoprint could produce rich
and compelling imagery.
Diebenkorn pushed beyond the
more cerebral and less open
Santa Monica prints to a richer,
more varied, and organic lan
guage in the Stanford series. The

Stanford series strikes one as
good fun, perhaps because of the
vigor of the metamorphosis. A
humorous note is left on one
Stanford print, underscoring
what was weak in the earlier
works; "Take a good look. Dick
this is a bloody formula." The
origin of this message remains as
enigmatic as the subtle varia
tions in the Stanford series, but
the statement provided a light
touch to an otherwise serious
undertaking.
Permanent selections
The exhibit was assembled at
UCLA by Gerald Nordland,
Director of the Frederick S.
Wight Art Gallery. An excerpt
from the show's catalog,
which includes a critical essay
by Nordland, provides adequate
background for those unfamiliar
with the artist or the art form.
The museum also plans to dis
play a number of Diebenkorn's
drawings from the permanent
collection in the contemporary
section of the museum. A special
Tuesday luncheon tour of the
exhibit is scheduled for Feb.

This is an excellent exhibit for
those acquainted with Dieben
korn's art as well as for those
who are not. The monoprint
technique has been reinvigo
rated by his willingness to re
work imagery, subjecting it to
thoughtful consideration, and
especially by his willingness to
show his process from begin

The current exhibit of Richard
Diebenkorn's monotypes at the
Stanford Museum should be of
special interest to the Stanford
community. Not only is Dieben
korn a Stanford graduate (class
of '49), and a former artist-in
residence (1963-4), but the
majority of monotypes were exe
cuted at Stanford under the aegis
of Nathan Oliveira, professor of
Art here. Beyond all that, the
exhibit provides a particularly
compelling view of Dieben
korn's "process" and method of
painting.
Although Diebenkorn does
not consider himself a
printmaker, he decided to
explore the monotype medium,
which had had a recent revival at
Stanford under Oliveira, when
he received two catalogues of
monotypes by Degas and Goya
from Oliveira.
Diebenkorn's first prints were
executed in Santa Monica,
California, in spring of 1974, and
a second series, shown in its en
tirety in this exhibit, was created
during a weekend visit to Stan
ford in April, 1975.
Monotype, or monoprint, is a
modified form of printmaking.
The artist cannot generate an
edition of prints of the same im
age, but uses a plate for its spe
cial qualities. The image is
applied by rag, brush, hand, or
any other means to a flat metal or
glass plate, using various prin
ters' inks or paint.
The plate will generate one
fully saturated print, but a ghost
image will remain. This "pen
timento" can be exploited for the
next print or wiped clean. Cer
tain subtle tones which could
not be otherwise achieved are
possible through this degenera
tion of the ink density.
Relentless self-criticism
Diebenkorn is relentless in his
self-criticism, and normally
meticulous about editing his
works for a show. He will not
hesitate to destroy a canvas, no
matter how much work has gone
into it, if it does not seem suc
cessful to him. This exhibit is

Dialogue
It is Diebenkorn's dialogue
that makes the monotypes excit
ing, as well as making them
small revelations of his earlier
works. As one follows a series,
the images transform, and are
"corrected," yet many of the
prints are complete by them
selves. There is no dependence
upon serial imagery.
The Stanford 4-11-75 series
generated 13 prints, beginning
with a black club shape that ap
pears as a ghost in subsequent
images. Then. Diebenkorn
breaks into variations upon
themes explored in the Ocean
Park series. Geometric forms are
balanced, then reassembled
until one reaches the final print
where a minimum amount of
black remains, and large white
forms that have evolved through
the last five prints dominate the
print.
The quality of the ink in the
Stanford prints added a richness
that was not present in the more

subtle and austere grays of the
Santa Monica series. Inks were
limited to black, which degener
ated into various grays, and a
rare umber and blue. Diebenkorn
did not hesitate to reverse the
plate, to alternate between sharp
and exact lines, washes,
splotches, brushed lines or
fields, and handworked areas
that contained finger and palm
prints. The ink attains a velvet
texture in some areas, and is
speckled or washed thin in
others.
Diebenkorn wrote, in 1957,
"All paintings start out of a
mood, out of a relationship with
things or people, out of complete
visual impression. To call this
impression abstract seems to me
often to confuse the issue.
Abstract means literally to draw
from or separate. In this sense
every artist is abstract, for he
must create his own work from
his visual impressions. A realis
tic or non-objective approach
makes no difference. The result
is what counts." Diebenkorn
studied in the 1950's with mem
bers of the figurative school, but
returned to abstraction to allow
himself "to follow the painting
in terms of just what 1 want for
the painting as opposed to the
qualifying that I found 1 had to
do in figure painting."
Yet it is still surprising to find
that the sparse visual language
afforded by a black and white
monoprint could produce rich
and compelling imagery.
Diebenkorn pushed beyond the
more cerebral and less open
Santa Monica prints to a richer,
more varied, and organic lan
guage in the Stanford series. The

Stanford series strikes one as
good fun, perhaps because of the
vigor of the metamorphosis. A
humorous note is left on one
Stanford print, underscoring
what was weak in the earlier
works; "Take a good look. Dick
this is a bloody formula." The
origin of this message remains as
enigmatic as the subtle varia
tions in the Stanford series, but
the statement provided a light
touch to an otherwise serious
undertaking.

The current exhibit of Richard
Diebenkorn's monotypes at the
Stanford Museum should be of
special interest to the Stanford
community. Not only is Dieben
korn a Stanford graduate (class
of '49), and a former artist-in
residence (1963-4), but the
majority of monotypes were exe
cuted at Stanford under the aegis
of Nathan Oliveira, professor of
Art here. Beyond all that, the
exhibit provides a particularly
compelling view of Dieben
korn's "process" and method of
painting.
Although Diebenkorn does
not consider himself a
printmaker, he decided to
explore the monotype medium,
which had had a recent revival at
Stanford under Oliveira, when
he received two catalogues of
monotypes by Degas and Goya
from Oliveira.
Diebenkorn's first prints were
executed in Santa Monica,
California, in spring of 1974, and
a second series, shown in its en
tirety in this exhibit, was created
during a weekend visit to Stan
ford in April, 1975.
Monotype, or monoprint, is a
modified form of printmaking.
The artist cannot generate an
edition of prints of the same im
age, but uses a plate for its spe
cial qualities. The image is
applied by rag, brush, hand, or
any other means to a flat metal or
glass plate, using various prin
ters' inks or paint.
The plate will generate one
fully saturated print, but a ghost
image will remain. This "pen
timento" can be exploited for the
next print or wiped clean. Cer
tain subtle tones which could
not be otherwise achieved are
possible through this degenera
tion of the ink density.
Relentless self-criticism
Diebenkorn is relentless in his
self-criticism, and normally
meticulous about editing his
works for a show. He will not
hesitate to destroy a canvas, no
matter how much work has gone
into it, if it does not seem suc
cessful to him. This exhibit is
thus doubly unique since
monotype is a relatively "new"
medium for the artist, and he has
al lowed all of the prints from the
Stanford series to be displayed
despite what he might consider
to be flaws. The Santa Monica

Series was edited from 36 to 11
prints.
Diebenkorn is best known for
his Ocean Park paintings, begun
in the 1960's in Santa Monica.
The title derives from the loca
tion of his studio, and under
scores the influence of the land
scape. the studio environment,
and the light in his work. The
canvases, which are quite large,
were worked out through a long
process, beginning with draw
ing with charcoal or graphite di
rectly onto the canvas. The ini
tial image might be erased, or
reworked, and gradually, color
would be added and balanced.
At times, Diebenkorn has com
pletely repainted a canvas in a
day, totally reworking the im
age.
Diebenkorn develops a
dialogue with his works. Al
though his paintings are
abstract, and perhaps initially
remote to he has in
vested each canvas with a great
deal of his personality. Critic
John Russell wrote, "The Ocean
