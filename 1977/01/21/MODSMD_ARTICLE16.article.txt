# 'Our Tuition' out of action
## 
### Missy Peabody 
Our Tuition has had to suspend, temporarily,
her racing career while she nurses her sore .inkles.
A group of six students here bought the three
year-old race horse a year ago and dubbed them
selves the "Seven Card Stud."
Although they lost $1200, A 1 Nicora, a member
of the group, said without regret, "We lost money
but gained a lot of fun and experience." He thinks
that Our Tuiton will make her way back to the
track this spring.
"She's still a good horse," he said, "and she'll
do well in a distance race; especially if it rains.
She has always loved to run in the mud."
"We were trying to think of ways to make
money and horse racing sounded like an exciting
idea," said Nicora. "We knew we could buy a
good horse at a reasonable amount—slooo —and
have fun at the same time."
They had intended to use their winnings to help
pay their tuition, but the Fates refused to take the
bit. Our Tuition's career was to be pockmarked
with financial drains.
The group put her into training immediately.
She was ready to run by February. 1975, but Golden
Gate Fields went on strike and the track closed
down. It reopened soon afterwards and Our Tui
tion resumed training. As her second chance to

compete approached, in May. 197b, the Fields
went on strike again.
After that, she took ill so they sent her to a horse
farm near Pleasanton to recuperate. Eventually,
she recovered her health.
Last October, she made her debut at the Bay
Meadows race track. "It was a big day." remem
bers Nicora. "She was really nervous because it
was her first time out. The TV cameras watched us
as we saddled her up. and all of us were excited to
see her race, considering all the trouble we'd had
getting her there."
Unfortunately, her first effort wasn't a reward
ing one. She came in 11th out of a field of 12.
She didn't give up, though, and her tenacity
paid off. In the next series of races, she came in
seventh, sixth, and finally third — a victory worth
$490.
"It was an amazing improvement," Nicora
commented. "She was 15 lengths bellind. when
all of a sudden she took off."
Regrettably, it was a case of too little too late.
The three year old developed sore ankles from
running on a muddy track in mid-November and
has not raced since. The Seven Card Stud dis
banded and sold their protege back to her original
owner for the price at which they had purchased
her.

Our Tuition has had to suspend, temporarily,
her racing career while she nurses her sore .inkles.
A group of six students here bought the three
year-old race horse a year ago and dubbed them
selves the "Seven Card Stud."
Although they lost $1200, A 1 Nicora, a member
of the group, said without regret, "We lost money
but gained a lot of fun and experience." He thinks
that Our Tuiton will make her way back to the
track this spring.
"She's still a good horse," he said, "and she'll
do well in a distance race; especially if it rains.
She has always loved to run in the mud."
"We were trying to think of ways to make
money and horse racing sounded like an exciting
idea," said Nicora. "We knew we could buy a
good horse at a reasonable amount—slooo —and
have fun at the same time."
They had intended to use their winnings to help
pay their tuition, but the Fates refused to take the
bit. Our Tuition's career was to be pockmarked
with financial drains.
The group put her into training immediately.
She was ready to run by February. 1975, but Golden
Gate Fields went on strike and the track closed
down. It reopened soon afterwards and Our Tui
tion resumed training. As her second chance to

compete approached, in May. 197b, the Fields
went on strike again.
After that, she took ill so they sent her to a horse
farm near Pleasanton to recuperate. Eventually,
she recovered her health.
Last October, she made her debut at the Bay
Meadows race track. "It was a big day." remem
bers Nicora. "She was really nervous because it
was her first time out. The TV cameras watched us
as we saddled her up. and all of us were excited to
see her race, considering all the trouble we'd had
getting her there."
Unfortunately, her first effort wasn't a reward
ing one. She came in 11th out of a field of 12.
She didn't give up, though, and her tenacity
paid off. In the next series of races, she came in
seventh, sixth, and finally third — a victory worth
$490.
"It was an amazing improvement," Nicora
commented. "She was 15 lengths bellind. when
all of a sudden she took off."
Regrettably, it was a case of too little too late.
The three year old developed sore ankles from
running on a muddy track in mid-November and
has not raced since. The Seven Card Stud dis
banded and sold their protege back to her original
owner for the price at which they had purchased
her.
