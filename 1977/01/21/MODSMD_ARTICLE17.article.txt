# Mem Chu sermon program
## 
### Fred Cheever 
Stanford's Memorial Church
has launched a new program of
sermons for winter quarter. The
program will attempt to address
directly the problems of the
Stanford community, both
spiritual and secular. Sermons
are scheduled on such topics as
abortion, the honor code, and al
cohol and drug abuse. The ser
mons and post-sermon discus
sions are meant to serve as a
"guide for the perplexed" and a
forum in which the problems of
the community can be freely dis
cussed.
The idea of the program came
mainly from suggestions by
members of the congregation,
mostly students who felt that
earlier sermons had not been
specific enough in their treat
ment of the problems of daily
life. The program has been or
ganized and implimented by
Robert Hamerton-Kelly, Dean of

the Chapel, and the Chapel
Board, a committee of twenty
five student parishioners who
steer the Church's social policy.
Memorial Church, situated in
the Stanford Ouadrangle, holds
non-sectarian protestant ser
vices every Sunday at 11a.m.
The new program consists of
nine sermons. Each will give the
Christian view of the week's to
pic. The sermons will be fol
lowed by discussion meetings
led by an expert on the subject
normally a person from outside
the church. The first discussion
in the series, held last Sunday,
on the topic of "Relationships
and Sexuality" was led by L)r.
Vince D'Andrea of the Cowell
Student Health Center.
So far, reaction to the program
has been generally favorable.
Hamerton-Kelly was encour
aged by a large turnout for the
first sermon. One parishioner
later commented that he was

happy that the church was fi
nally discussing the problems he
talked about every day. How
ever, another complained that
the subject matter was more fit
for the shower than the pulpit. If
the reaction remains favorable,
Hamerton-Kelly hopes to con
tinue the program; not every
quarter, but at least one quarter
every year or two, so that every
Stanford student would have a
chance to experience it at least
once during his or her four years.
The new sermon program is
part of the larger policv of the
Church and the Chapel Hoard
to communicate with the
residents of the university
and the surrounding commun
ity. In the past the Church has
organized a variety of social ac
tivities for area people, both stu
dent and non-student. On Feb.
13 after regular services,
an open meeting will be held to
hear comments and suggestions
about present and possible fu
ture church activities.
This week's sermon and dis
cussion will address the "Moral
Problems of Privilege: The Cift
and the Task".
