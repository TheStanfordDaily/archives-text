## Card spikers open season 
### Jill Lieber Julie Fiedler 
Stanford's Northern California
Championship men's volleyball
team opens the 1977 season
against UCLA tonight at 7:30 in
Pauley Pavilion. The NCAA
champion Bruins will make a re
turn visit to Stanford Feb. 11.
After the game at UCLA, the
Cards will move on to compete
in the tough UC-Santa Barbara
Tournament Saturday and Sun
day.
Many of the top teams in the
nation are entered in the UCSB
24-team tourney, with the field
including UC-Santa Barbara,
San Diego State, UC-San Diego,
UCLA, IJSC and Pepperdine.
With a league championship
already behind them, the Card
volleyball squad is setting its
goal one step higher this season.
Head coach Art Lambert is con
fident the team will better last
year's 11-4 record and he is al
ready looking toward the NCAA
Regional competition.
"We're definitely a better team
than last year," Lambert said.
"We have better balance with
stronger players at every posi
tion. Our defense and quickness
have both improved considera
bly."
Seniors Tom Duralde and
Andy Fishburn are called "two
of the top players in the country"
by Lambert.
Duralde started his volleyball

career late in high school yet has
become an Ail-American caliber
player. He played with the
Junior National Training squad
and with the strong Olympic
Club in San Francisco, and
therefore provides the Stanford
team with a great deal of com
petitive experience.
Fishburn, a high school
graduate of volleyball pow
erhouse Harvard School in Los
Angeles, is a top notch player.
On the beach he competes on the
AAA level — the most advanced
in volleyball.
Freshman Kim Lum from
Hawaii and Rod Fletcher from
Connecticut will add a great deal
of talent to the Card team. Other
new names on the roster include
freshmen Jack Foxworth, Tom
Grimes and Bill Urick. Seniors
CharlieCosgrove, Rich Rand and
Tim Williams, juniors Wendel
Birkhofer, Scott Sedlacek and
Karl Yorston and sophomores
Bob Kamei and Rich Yardley
round out the Card squad.
The Cards have nine home
matches this season in Maples
Pavilion.

stars:

his volleyball career his senior

Hands up
Stanford's Charlie Cosgrove (left) and Andy Fishburn (right) go up to block a shot in a match last
year in Maples Pavilion. Both Card volleyball players return this year to the squad, giving
Stanford experience and hopes of knocking off some big teams this season.
Stanford's Northern California
Championship men's volleyball
team opens the 1977 season
against UCLA tonight at 7:30 in
Pauley Pavilion. The NCAA
champion Bruins will make a re
turn visit to Stanford Feb. 11.
After the game at UCLA, the
Cards will move on to compete
in the tough UC-Santa Barbara
Tournament Saturday and Sun
day.
Many of the top teams in the
nation are entered in the UCSB
24-team tourney, with the field
including UC-Santa Barbara,
San Diego State, UC-San Diego,
UCLA, IJSC and Pepperdine.
With a league championship
already behind them, the Card
volleyball squad is setting its
goal one step higher this season.
Head coach Art Lambert is con
fident the team will better last
year's 11-4 record and he is al
ready looking toward the NCAA
Regional competition.
"We're definitely a better team
than last year," Lambert said.
"We have better balance with
stronger players at every posi
tion. Our defense and quickness
have both improved considera
bly."
Seniors Tom Duralde and
Andy Fishburn are called "two
of the top players in the country"
by Lambert.
Duralde started his volleyball

career late in high school yet has
become an Ail-American caliber
player. He played with the
Junior National Training squad
and with the strong Olympic
Club in San Francisco, and
therefore provides the Stanford
team with a great deal of com
petitive experience.
Fishburn, a high school
graduate of volleyball pow
erhouse Harvard School in Los
Angeles, is a top notch player.
On the beach he competes on the
AAA level — the most advanced
in volleyball.
Freshman Kim Lum from
Hawaii and Rod Fletcher from
Connecticut will add a great deal
of talent to the Card team. Other
new names on the roster include
freshmen Jack Foxworth, Tom
Grimes and Bill Urick. Seniors
CharlieCosgrove, Rich Rand and
Tim Williams, juniors Wendel
Birkhofer, Scott Sedlacek and
Karl Yorston and sophomores
Bob Kamei and Rich Yardley
round out the Card squad.
The Cards have nine home
matches this season in Maples
Pavilion.
A closer look at Stanford's top
stars:
Tom Duralde (Senior): Began
his volleyball career his senior
year in high school playing for
the USVB A club
team . . . started for Stanford as a
frosh, then took a year off to play
for San Francisco's Olympic

Club . . . Olympic Club placed

Andy Fishburn (Senior): Sec
