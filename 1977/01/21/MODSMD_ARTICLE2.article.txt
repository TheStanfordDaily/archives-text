## Jimmy takes the oath 
### 
Washington— Jimmy Carter, an out
sider no more, was inaugurated presi
dent of the United States yesterday,
urging upon his countrymen fresh
faith and new commitment to "the
bold and brilliant dream" of America.
Three minutes past a sunny, icy
noon, Carter concluded the oath of of
fice that restored the White House to
the custody of the voters and ended the
29-month appointed presidency of
Gerald Ford.
A crowd of about 1 50,000 people as
sembled in the cold of the Capitol
plaza to watch as Carter became the
39th president, and to salute the 38th.
The temperature was in the upper
20s, and it was weather for mufflers
and stocking caps along with the ruf
fles and flourishes. Carter shunned
coat or hat, despite the chill.
Mondale first
Vice President Walter Mondale was
sworn in first, by House Speaker
Thomas O'Neill.
Then Carter stepped solemnly to his
place to take the presidential oath
while his wife, Rosalynn held a family
Bible.
His inaugural address was a spare,
12-minute summons of hope, not an
agenda or blue-print.
The first words he spoke as presi
dent were words of thanks to the de
parting Ford "for all he had done to
heal our land."
Carter (James Earl Jr. by birth, Jimmy
by preference) spoke of his hopes and
goals for the four years now beginning,
for "a new dedication within our gov
ernment, and a new spirit among us
a 11...
'No new dream'
"Two centuries ago, our nation's
birth was a milestone in the long quest
for freedom, but the bold and brilliant
dream which excited the founders of
our nation still awaits its consumma
tion," he said. "I have no new dream to
set forth today, but rather urge a fresh
faith in the old spirit."
"Our government must at the same
time be both competent and compas
sionate," he said.
He promised an administration ot
quiet strength, "so sufficient that it
need not be proven in combat...
"We will be ever vigilant and never
vulnerable, and we will fight our wars
against poverty, ignorance and injus
tice, for those are the enemies against
which our forces can be honorably
marshaled," he said.
It was not a litany of programs, but
there was one specific pledge: to a new
arms limitation agreement with the
Soviet Union this year. Carter called it
"a step toward our ultimate goal—the

elimination of all nuclear weapons
from this earth."
At home, he cautioned, "we can
neither answer all questions nor solve
all problems. We cannot afford to do
everything, nor can we afford to lack
boldness as we meet the future...We
must simply do our best."
After the ceremony. Ford took a final
walk through the Capitol, receiving
applause from former colleagues as he
and his wife walked to a waiting
helicopter.
It lifted off from the snow-covered
lawn at the foot of the Capitol and cir
cled the city for a sentimental final

look.
There was a 21-gun salute at An
drews Air Forch Base, and the Fords
boarded a presidential jetliner for
Monterey, California.
Tears had glistened in Ford's eyes as
he said his goodby to about 75 of his
closest aides and advisers at a White
House breakfast early that day. "You
all contributed to an administration I
think was good, and which history
will treat kindly," he said.
At the door of the State Dining
Room, he turned to wave. "Goodby.
everybody. Thank you all very, very
much."
