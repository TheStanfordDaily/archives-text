## Pat Baldwin: hockey coach with a dream 
### Laura Ost 
This coach does not stroll
along the team bench in a busi
ness suit with hands in his
pockets nor does he police play
from a dugout.
Pat Baldwin is instead
known as center forward
number 11 for Stanford's ice
hockey team, "advising" as
much through his own hustle
and even-tempered en
thusiasm as through an active
coaching role.
Results? Baldwin coached
Stanford to an 11-1 record last
season and the team has out
scored opponents 40-20 so far
this year.
Management
"1 try and run the club so it
comes from them (the stu
dents), how they want to play,"
explained 36-year-old
"Baldy." "I just do the advis
ing. They give me the person
nel and I manage it."
He admitted that it is not
easy to be both a player and a
coach, "especially staying or
ganized and keeping my cool.
P somebody makes a mistake
I'm not sure if I've made the
same mistake."
. "He plays the coach role

pretty low key," said sopho
more wing Henry Dudley.
"He's quiet for the most part
but he senses when it's time to
come out of the player role, like
when we're just not playing
smart."
"He wants to win as much as
anybody," added Murray Ken
ney, "but he doesn't act like it's
a matter of life or death
whether we win or lose. The
main thing is to skate and have
a good time."
Have a good time
Baldwin has one fundamen
tal rule: no dope or alcohol for
24 hours before a game.
Beyond that, the players seem
to feel he emphasizes the spirit
of the game and is a vital part of
their community.
"Although he's much older
than us, he's easy to be with,
like he's just one of the guys,"
Dudley said. "He's a good guy
to party with."
Ken Breitenbach recalled his
freshman year when he made
the team.
"I was playing really shitty
because I hadn't played in a
year, and I was apprehensive of
people on the team," he said.
"Pat really helped me feel com

fortahle and get to know
everyone."
On the ice. Baldwin's quick
maneuvers are punctuated by
wild whoops and his ever
present wit. Hockey President
Danny Schley remembered a
particularly rough game last
season when two bruisers con
verged on Pat, one aiming for
his head and the other for his
knees. Baldwin slipped deftly
between them with the puck
and as thev crashed together

and slid into the boards, he
turned around and stuck his
tongue out gleefully.
Top credentials
Baldwin has taken the con
cept of Stanford hockey seri
ously, however, from the be
ginning. Eight years ago a
psychiatrist named Fuller Tor
rey started the team, and Pat
moved to California from De
troit to be the coach.
"There was a shortage of
players," he recalled, "so 1
started playing." No rookie,
Baldwin's credentials include
three years of varsity hockey at
Michigan State, five years in
the Toronto Maple Leafs' farm
system and a year overseas
with a Dutch team.
Maintaining a hockey team
at Stanford is no easy matter
since University funding is
minimal ($6,000 divided
among 13 club sports) and
there is no ice rink nearby.
"There seems to be a grow
ing pressure from the athletic
department to curtail club
sports activity." Baldwin said.
"Each year it's harder and har
der to get funding. I've seen it
(ice hockey) grow in California,
but the only way it'll grow in

this area is to get better
facilities."
'Home rink
The team currently practices
once a week in Belmont and
plays most of its games on the
road. Baldwin expressed the
hope that there might someday
be a Bay Area league and that
Stanford could have a "home"
rink.
"I want these guys to be able
to play in front of their
girlfriends," he said with a
grin.
Baldwin's creativity extends
beyond the blue line. He quit
his job with a computer com
pany last year to become self
employed. and has since re
novated two old houses
which he rents to Stanford stu
dents.
Self-employed
"1 wanted to try something
different, live by my own
means," he explained. "It's
given me a lot of time to think
about myself and my future."
Not content to rest with his
present success, Pat looks al
ready to next year when the
team will have lost its core ot
players to graduation.
