# Globetrotters offer tricks, laughter

Sweet Georgia Hrown!
Laughterand basketball magic
are coming to Stanford as the
Harlem Globetrotters, the origi
nal cage clowns, invade Maples
Pavilion this Friday at 8 p.m.
Sponsored by ASSU Special
Events, the Globetrotters and
other pre-gameacts will perform
to raise funds for Stanford club
sports.
This is the Globetrotter's sec
ond trip to Stanford in the last
two years, but this is not exactly
the same club that charmed au
diences last year. The Globetrot
ters have "gone corporate," so to
speak, under new owners Met
romedia Corporation.
"We're under our third set of
owners," says Hailie Bryant,
publicity agent and ex-
Globetrotter. "We started out
under the late Abe Saperstein
who owned the club from 1027
to 1965. Next we were under Pot
ter Palmer, based in Ghicago
until June of 1976, when Met
romedia bought the team and
moved the home office to Los
Angeles."
Half a century
The Globetrotters have been in
existence for 50 years, and in
that span they've visited 94
countries. Their season that
stretches from October to April
with a European tour from May
to July. Such stars as Wilt Cham
berlain, Connie Hawkins, and
baseball pitcher Hob Gibson
have played for the Globetrot
ters, who face perennial rival,
the Jersey Reds, Friday in
Maples.
Playing for the Globetrotters
right now is former local prep
star Nate Hranch, who per
formed his magic at
Ravenswood High School. He,
along with Fred "Curley" Neal,
runs the offense as floor general.
Heading up the show, of
course, is the legendary
Meadowlark Lemon, now in his
23rd year, as coach and head
showman. Standing 6'2" and

weighing IHO pounds, Meadow
lark is the ageless wonder of the
team; ask him his age and he'll say
lie's between 17 and 82 years
old.
Loud mouth
As coach, Meadowlark directs
the entire show, getting the four
team elements (the dribbles, the
gunner, the dunker and the
showman) to work together. As
showman, he inserts established
routines at the right time, and
extemporizes when necessary.
"Surprise is a big element
along with timing," says Hailie,
himself a 20 year veteran.
"People expect us to do certain
things like the confetti/water
bucket, the trick balls and the
dribbling act. The material just
runs out of your ears and the
showman has to be pretty much
in control."
In the same way, the Globet
rotters take care of potential
players. Each year, one or two
spots open up on the two 11-
player teams the Globetrotters
manage. To fill those openings,
about 20 to 30 players are invited
to trvout camps, the number
based on recommendations of
former Globetrotters who now
coach.
Want Wolfe?
"We look first for basketball
ability in a player," states Hailie,
an Indiana star of the late fifties,
"the same skills that make an
NHA player. Next we look for
character, and it always helps to
have an oddball personality. Fi
nally. we look to fill spots in our
four categories of players."
It was a hit different in the
early days of the club. The play
was more serious, emphasizing
skill over razzle-dazzle. They
played the Minneapolis Lakers,
champions of the then young
NHA, and beat them in a best of
five series. And in a 25-game
series with college all-stars, the
Globetrotters won all but two.
Hut today, the emphasis is on
entertainment.

nal cage clowns, invade Maples
Pavilion this Friday at 8 p.m.
Sponsored by ASSU Special
Events, the Globetrotters and
other pre-gameacts will perform
to raise funds for Stanford club
sports.
This is the Globetrotter's sec
ond trip to Stanford in the last
two years, but this is not exactly
the same club that charmed au
diences last year. The Globetrot
ters have "gone corporate," so to
speak, under new owners Met
romedia Corporation.
"We're under our third set of
owners," says Hailie Bryant,
publicity agent and ex-
Globetrotter. "We started out
under the late Abe Saperstein
who owned the club from 1027
to 1965. Next we were under Pot
ter Palmer, based in Ghicago
until June of 1976, when Met
romedia bought the team and
moved the home office to Los
Angeles."
Half a century
The Globetrotters have been in
existence for 50 years, and in
that span they've visited 94
countries. Their season that
stretches from October to April
with a European tour from May
to July. Such stars as Wilt Cham
berlain, Connie Hawkins, and
baseball pitcher Hob Gibson
have played for the Globetrot
ters, who face perennial rival,
the Jersey Reds, Friday in
Maples.
Playing for the Globetrotters
right now is former local prep
star Nate Hranch, who per
formed his magic at
Ravenswood High School. He,
along with Fred "Curley" Neal,
runs the offense as floor general.
Heading up the show, of
course, is the legendary
Meadowlark Lemon, now in his
23rd year, as coach and head
showman. Standing 6'2" and

weighing IHO pounds, Meadow
lark is the ageless wonder of the
team; ask him his age and he'll say
lie's between 17 and 82 years
old.
Loud mouth
As coach, Meadowlark directs
the entire show, getting the four
team elements (the dribbles, the
gunner, the dunker and the
showman) to work together. As
showman, he inserts established
routines at the right time, and
extemporizes when necessary.
"Surprise is a big element
along with timing," says Hailie,
himself a 20 year veteran.
"People expect us to do certain
things like the confetti/water
bucket, the trick balls and the
dribbling act. The material just
runs out of your ears and the
showman has to be pretty much
in control."
In the same way, the Globet
rotters take care of potential
players. Each year, one or two
spots open up on the two 11-
player teams the Globetrotters
manage. To fill those openings,
about 20 to 30 players are invited
to trvout camps, the number
based on recommendations of
former Globetrotters who now
coach.
Want Wolfe?
"We look first for basketball
ability in a player," states Hailie,
an Indiana star of the late fifties,
"the same skills that make an
NHA player. Next we look for
character, and it always helps to
have an oddball personality. Fi
nally. we look to fill spots in our
four categories of players."
It was a hit different in the
early days of the club. The play
was more serious, emphasizing
skill over razzle-dazzle. They
played the Minneapolis Lakers,
champions of the then young
NHA, and beat them in a best of
five series. And in a 25-game
series with college all-stars, the
Globetrotters won all but two.
Hut today, the emphasis is on
entertainment.
