Gandhi restores key democratic rights
New Delhi — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's govern
ment restored key democratic rights yesterday after 19
months of stern emergency rule — ordering the release of
political prisoners, lifting press censorship and revoking a
ban on public rallies.
The government said the decisions were taken to speed
the revival of political normalcy as the country prepares
for parliamentary elections in March.
Even before the series of announcements, four non-
Communist opposition parties made known that they had
buried their political differences to form a united front
against Gandhi's Congress party in the coming elections.
The end of censorship on the nation's press represented
one of the most dramatic actions symbolizing the relaxa
tion of the emergency.
The government invoked censorship in the first hours of
the emergency on June 26, 1975, and opposition leaders
later acknowledged that the rigid press restrictions had
done more than anything else to crush vocal disseti*
against Gandhi's rule.
Catholic schools defy apartheid laws
Johannesburg, South Africa — Roman Catholic
schools, defying apartheid laws, have opened their doors
to all races, prompting government threats yesterday to
close the schools.
Five private Catholic schools in the Johannesburg area,
two in Port Elizabeth in Cape Province and two in Win
dhoek, South-West Africa, admitted about 80 black, In
dian or mixed race students.

The administrator of Cape Province, L. Munnik, said
that unless the schools meet the requirement that they
educate only European-origin children, the withdrawal of
their registration and the closing of schools enrolling
nonwhite pupils would be considered.
UC regents debate interests code
San Francisco — University of California regents
worked at softening a proposed conflict-of-interest code
yesterday and bickered over ways to ward off collective
bargaining for UC employes.
Regent Dean Watkins proposed dropping requirements
that regents disclose investments in stocks that UC also
owns and in companies that sell supplies to the univer
sity. They would still have to disclose their property hold
ings near UC campuses and some bank investments.
The conflict-of-interest code will be submitted to the
state Fair Political Practices Commission for approval
next month after some changes expected to reduce the
required financial disclosures for regents.
On the collective-bargaining issue, several regents
suggested UC take some of the steam out of the drive for
full union rights for its employes by granting them limited
negotiating rights.
Today's weather
Variable clouds through tomorrow. Chance of sprinkles
today and tonight. Lows in the 40s. Highs in the 50s. Light
