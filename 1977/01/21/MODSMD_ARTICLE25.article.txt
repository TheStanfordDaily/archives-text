# Pass/NC: earning greater acceptance

### Randy David Staff writer 
A sampling of graduate schools
here, at UC-Berkeley and Harvard
show that most graduate admission of
fices disregard a pass grade on an
applicant's transcript, as long as they
are not excessive.
Any grades for courses outside a
student's major are almost not consi
dered in the math department here, ac
cording to Halsey Royden, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
jnd former member of the Math De
partment's admissions committee.
Courses taken with a pass grade in
math and physics are looked at with
skepticism, he said. However, the
types of courses taken and letters of
recommendation are more important
than grades in the admission process,
according to Royden.
The view of the pass grade by the
English Department is similar to that
of the Math Department. The original
purpose of the pass/no credit system
was to enable a student to take a course
outside their major without penalty of
a low grade, David Riggs, chairman of
the English Department's admissions
committee, said.
'Pass' not an evaluation
"This is still its most proper use,"
said Riggs. The problem with the pass
grade is that there is no basis for evalu
ation, he said.
It doesn't matter how many pass/no
credit courses are taken by Cal English
Department applicants, according to
Iris Roberts, admissions secretary.
Grade-point averages are only com
puted for the junior and senior years
and pass grades are not taken into con
sideration, she said.
Stanford Law School advises
applicants that it is generally detri
mental to admission to take couses
pass/no credit, according to William
Baxter, chairman of the Law School
admissions committee.
Baxter said it would not hurt stu
dents to take one or two courses with a
pass grade as long as the courses were
independent of their field of endeavor.
If a course taken with a pass grade is
"way out of the student's field, we tend
to ignore it," he said. The admissions
committee does not arbitrarily assign a
letter grade to a pass grade, according
to Baxter.
Courses taken with a pass grade do

not have an adverse effect on the
evaluation of applicants to Harvard
Law School, according to June
Thompson, assistant director of ad- i
missions there. Other courses taken for
a grade are looked at rather than
courses with a pass grade, even if a
student takes a course in his major
with a pass grade, she said. No numer
ical or letter value is placed upon a
pass grade, Thompson added.
At the Cal Law School, the admis
sions committee looks at how a pass
grade affects the other grades during
any one quarter, according to Martha
Africa, admissions officer there. In
other words, she said, if a student takes
one course pass/no credit during one
quarter and earns an A in each of the
other courses, but takes no pass/no cre
dit courses during another quarter and
earns As and Bs, the student's records ;
are looked at more carefully. "We
don't penalize people for taking
courses pass/no credit," Africa added.
Stanford Medical Center requires a
written evaluation for required
courses taken with a pass grade, ac
cording to Cheryl Lomaglio, adminis
trative assistant to the admissions
committee. However, she said, if only
a few courses are taken outside the
student's major field with a pass grade,
there is no problem. When looking at
the overall grade-point average, pass
grades are not considered, Lomaglio
added.
Grades verify personal claims
The Graduate School of Business
here looks at an applicant's transcript
as verification of his personal state
ment, according to Lawrie Lerberman,
director of admissions. A pass grade
alone does not matter, it depends on
the specific circumstances, he said. "A
pass grade is rarely the sole criteria for
admission or rejection," Lieberman
said.
"Generally one pass/no credit course
per quarter is perfectly acceptable,"
said Elizabeth Meyer, assistant direc
tor for the Academic Information
Center. As most of the graduate
schools recommended, Meyer advises
students not to take courses in their
major pass/no credit. In excess, pass
grades can hurt you, she said.
"The pass options are intended to
relieve the pressure on students for
achievement of grades," according to
the Stanford University Bulletin. A

pass grade indicates academic
achievement of not less than D. and
there is no limit on the number of
courses that can be taken pass/no cre
dit, according to the Bulletin.
The decision to offer a course with a
pass/no credit option is made by the
instructor and the department. The
student has until the middle of the
quarter to decide whether to take ad
vantage of the option.
Instructors may also choose to offer a
course mandatory pass/no credit.
Many athletic courses utilize this grad
ing system.
