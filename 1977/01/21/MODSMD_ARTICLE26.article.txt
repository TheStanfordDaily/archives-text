Storey revolt
Most of the 39 women in Storey
House boycotted dinner in their dorm
last night to emphasize their demands
that their cook be replaced and that
they get more to eat.
"We're being neglected because
we're women," said Patty Serventi, a
senior in international relations and
one of the organizers of the boycott.
"Stanford has always made money
on its food service for Storey. They
have a traditional belief that women
have small appetites, that they only eat
salads. We have several athletes in the
house. If this were a coed dorm, we'd
have enough to eat." she added.
Several residents said that a major
problem was that house cook Ignacio
"Nacho" Amaral could not read En
glish and therefore had trouble read
ing recipes.
Amaral, interviewed in Spanish in
the kitchen amid trays of roast beef and
brownies, agreed that he "sometimes"
had trouble with reading recipes. He
, said that "nobody talked to me" about
their complaints.
