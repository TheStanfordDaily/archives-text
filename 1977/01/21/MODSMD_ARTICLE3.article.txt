# Union lingering in transitional period

### Pan Demetrakakes Staff writer 
When the members of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union went
to vote Oct. 19 on a three-year contract
with the university, a lot of them didn't
like the contract.
It passed by a vote of 367-350.
What do workers think of the con
tract now, three months later?
"It's too early to tell," said Jim Pif
fero, a production control clerk at En
cina. "But the money is attractive."
It should be. Encina's production
control (PC) clerks, who process uni
versity paychecks, got more than dou
ble the pay raise awarded to the aver
age university worker. This windfall
came because this contract is the first
one to include the PC clerks.
Some of them said they were sur
prised at the way they were taken into
the union. "We signed cards saying we
wanted to be in the union, but I
thought there would be a vote or some
thing," said PC clerk Barbara Kain.
"But noâ€”they just came to us and said,
'You're in.'"
A vote was not necessary under fed
eral labor law because the university
agreed to let USE represent the PC
clerks, according to former USE Presi
dent Roger Hardy, who supervised the
signing of the contract. "Management
sold them out," he said. "They
realized that their hold on them was
getting tenuous."
Other computer operators have
more substantial complaints against
the contract. The Stanford Center for
Information Processing (SCIP) has a
policy of training all employes to be
come "shift leaders" (senior operators

during a given period of work). But
there can be only one leader per shift.
"We worked out a compromise
whereby management would put 12
workers at SLAC and 12 at Encina at
lead pay all the time," Hardy said.
The problem is that those operators
not on that list of 12 cannot become
shift leaders unless one of the 12 quits
or dies.
"A handful of senior operators went
in with Roger and came out at two or
three in the morning with the settle
ment," said Michael Coleman, a
former shop steward for SCIP. "For the
restofus, it was likea slapintheface."
Coleman claimed that the operators
who met with Hardy were the ones
who became shift leaders.
"We left how (the shift leaders)
would be picked and who they would
be up to further negotiations," Hardy
said.
However, Hardy admitted that the
arrangement is not working out. It is
currently being renegotiated between
the university and SCIP, with help
from the union.
Hardy said the problem is partly the
university's fault. "Management chose
to implement the old solution while
the new one is being worked out," he
said.
Health insurance is another problem
in the contract. Food Services worker
Saul Cardenas said that in one month
his premium rose from $18 to $40.
The university provides insurance
under a plan left over from the old con
trac. It offered a new medical/dental
plan which the workers voted down
before accepting the rest of the con
tract.
