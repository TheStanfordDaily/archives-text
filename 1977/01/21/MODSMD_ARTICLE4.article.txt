# Bingo on Palo Alto horizon

### Kurt Cobb 
Bingo may soon be coming to Palo
Alto.
At its regular meeting last Monday
the Palo Alto City Council defeated an
ordinance allowing bingo by a vote of
4-3. However, because two council
members were not present, Mayor
Stanley Norton moved for a con
tinuance until the next meeting this
Monday.
After voters amended the state con
stitution last June to allow each com
munity to decide whether it wants
bingo games, theCity Council directed

City Attorney Robert Booth to draw up
an ordinance for the regulation of such
games. Booth indicated that as many
as 60 organizations in Palo Alto could
become eligible under the new ordi
nance.
The greatest opposition to the new
ordinance so far comes from the police
department. The report submitted by
the city attorney included the depart
ment's feeling that bingo games would
bring "a substantial enforcement bur
den (on them). . .
A spokesman for the police said that
much additional investigative time

would be required to enforce the
numerous regulations and he felt that
the community had not expressed any
great desire for hi ngo.
If the measure is adopted, organiza
tions which seek licenses will have to
adhere to a long list of regulations.
Only nonprofit organizations would
be allowed to obtain licenses. The total
value of prizes awarded in any one
bingo game could not exceed $250 and
all receipts would have to be placed in
a separate account. Games could only
take place between noon and 11 p.m.
