# Iran still owes on controversial contract

The university faces the prospect of losing nearly
half a million dollars on a controversial contract with
Iran.
Approximately $425,000 remains unpaid on the
university's contracts with the National Iranian
Radio-Television (NIRT), due to unspecified Iranian
"dissatisfaction" with some of the work done, accord
ing to Earl Cilley, director of Sponsored Projects.
"Over the past 15 years, (Sponsored Projects) has
done over $990 million in research, and this is the first
such situation (of non-payment)," Cilley said.
Should the money not be recovered, losses to the
university would be made up from the Operating
Budget, according to Jon Erickson, assistant manager of
Sponsored Projects. Half of the income in that budget
comes from tuition.
The Iranian agency contracted with the university to
plan a domestic telecommunications satellite system
(the hardware portion of the contract) and to develop
programming recommendations for educational tele
vision in Iran (the software portion of the contract).
Bruce Lusignan, professor of electrical engineering,
principal investigator, and Ed Parker, professor of
communication, co-principal investigator, worked
jointly on the project, with Parker dealing solely with
software.
Speed-up requested
The original agreement signed Feb. 24,1975. retroac
tiveto Sept. 1,1974, totalled some $978,190 and stated
that the project would be completed in August, 1977,
said Cilley. The Iranians discontinued payment on the
software last spring while requesting an acceleration of
the work that summer.
Unexpectedly, at the end of October 1976. the Ira

nians terminated the contract, indicating dissatisfac
tion with the work that had been done on the software,
according to Cilley.
The Iranian Consul in San Francisco has been unav
ailable for comment on the matter. University officials
mentioned that they have not contacted Iranian offi
cials in the United States concerning this matter.
The termination clause, a standard portion of all
university overseas research projects, allows for un
ilateral termination at any time. The contractors then
have 60 days to wrap up the work plus 30 days for final
review.
Final reports to fulfill the contract obligations "are
due at the end of the month at the very latest," Cilley
said. The university remains confident that they have
fulfilled their side of the contract, although the "infor
mal group" of faculty that Vice-Provost for Research
William Massy convened in November to review the
work has not submitted an official report.
Officials expect payment
"I believe that all or a substantial part of (the out
standing sum) will be paid," said Massy. "They (the
Iranians) have not said they won't pay; they just haven't
paid as yet.
"It is kind of a fuzzy situation," Massy stated. "The
best we have is the statement in the termination notice
which indicates general dissatisfaction, but they want
to see the reports before they make up their mind."
The present dilemma of the university is due to a
complex series of factors. NIRT dissatisfaction stems
largely from work, provisions in the contract specifi
cally those dealing with software, which were what
Massy calls "rather vague." This could allow for a large
discrepancy in what NIRT expected and what the uni
versity proposed, especially when dealing with the
"constantly changing dimensions of knowledge and
technolosy in the area of communications." com

mented Cil ley.
"There appears to be some difference of opinion be
tween the principal investigator and the agency (NIRT)
as to what the priorities in the work were and what the
objectives were to be," stated Massy.
Parker said, "I've seen some contracts that were more
vague, and some that were more specific" and declared
himself "satisfied" with the work done.
Lusignan declined to comment on the Iranian dis
satisfaction and declared that "we are essentially com
pleting the contract with one or two minor excep
tions."
The lack of continuous monitoring by Iran of the
progress of the software apparently compounded the
problem.
Lusignan stated there was "consistent interaction"
between Iranian monitors and the hardware portion of
the contract, but that the software monitors were here
for only "a few days" during the contract's duration.
"The number of technical staff people (here) was not
as large as we anticipated." Cilley confirmed.
Three factors
The non-payment by the Iranians is due to three
major factors Massy indicated:
—The university's inexperience at negotiating over
seas contracts;
—Deficiencies in the university's administrative
mechanisms dealing with payment; and
—Gaps in communication inherent in international
business relations.
The university's approach to the negotiation of the
contract was based on "inexperience," said Massy.
"We assumed more of a basic understanding and
commonality — we approached the Iranians in this
thing as we would approach, say. the Energy Research
and Development Administration here in this country
We relied too much on verbal understandinc." he said.

The contract called for payments every quarter on a
cost reimbursement basis. Payments of about $84,000
per quarter were to be guaranteed by a "Standby Letter
of Credit." according to Article 3 of the contract.
As to why the university never used the letter to
recover outstanding debts, Massy replied, "As far as I
know the letter of credit was never issued."
Reattributed the university's non-action on this mat
ter to "an administrative foul-up. Our bargain-position
would be better if the letter of credit existed," he said.
Massy said he was unable to define "standby."
In January or February, 1976, a "critical piece of
particularly sophisticated work was added *o make the
work fully applicable" to the needs of the Iranians,
Lusignan said.
The Sponsored Projects Office was not notified of the
addition until June, according to Cilley.
It is unclear whether or not this action violates Arti
cle 2 of the contract which allows contract amendment
"only by written modification . . . executed by au
thorized representatives of Stanford and NIRT." Spon
ored Projects is the only group authorized to negotiate
ontracts for research here.
Payments split
Sponsored Projects was not aware that NIRT had
divided payments between hardware and software
until payments ceased on software in spring of 1976,
according to Cilley.
The Accounts Receivable Office here, accustomed to
late payment by U.S. agencies and attributing non
payment to the usual slow pace of international busi
ness. did not call attention to this until the second or
third non-payment, Cilley said. Actually, the univer
sity was receiving 50 per cent of the scheduled pay
ment each time.
Then the problem was "nobody really knew what the
