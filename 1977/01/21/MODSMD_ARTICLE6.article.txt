# Letters: native Americans

Obvious differences
I am writing this letter in support of
Stephen Carter's position on affirma
tive action (Daily, Jan. 3).
Minority people are different than
white people. No one can tell me that
the native American people living
here on the Northern Cheyenne Reser
vation are similar to people living in
Palo Alto and San Jose. There are some
striking differences.
One of the most obvious distinctions
is language. People here would rather
speak Cheyenne. In many instances,
English cannot adequately communi
cate an idea.

Living on a reservation is not the
same as growing up in Hillsborough or
Milpitas. Here, you do not find an en
vironment replete with theaters, lib
raries, museums and art galleries. In
stead, you are confronted with an envi
ronment where conditions are rather
harsh. P'or example, the unemploy
ment rate on the Northern Cheyenne
Reservation is currently around 60 per
cent.
Services which urban dwellers take
for granted are not so easily found on a
reservation. If you should require
emergency medical care you would
have a 100 mile ride ahead of you.

I realize that this country is sick and
tired of hearing about native American
problems. But until this nation lives
up to the true meaning of its name the
complaints shall and must continue.
The condition of the Cheyenne
people isn't just a pity, it's an outrage!

Long overdue
President Cerald Ford's decision to
pardon Iva Toguri, accused of having
been "Tokyo Rose" during World War
II and convicted of treason in 1949,
was long overdue.
Toguri's conviction was tainted
with perjured testimony, jingoistic
rhetoric, bungled investigations and
biased jurists. Even her prosecutor
admitted she wasn't a traitor.
In fact, she was a woman who found
herself stuck in Japan after Pearl Har
bor because of bureaucratic idiocy.
She took a post with Radio Tokyo and
served as an agent of American and
Australian prisoners of war attempting
to sabotage the Japanese propaganda
effort.
But more important than one indi
vidual's guilt or innocence is the prob
lem of reconciling laws against treason
with freedom of speech. We believe
Toguri had the right to speak her mind
against American policy without fear
of being convicted as a traitor.
Ford displayed courage in his act
. of pardon. That act, however, cannot
make up for 30 years of estrangement
; from her native land.

I realize that this country is sick and
tired of hearing about native American
problems. But until this nation lives
up to the true meaning of its name the
complaints shall and must continue.

Long overdue
President Cerald Ford's decision to
pardon Iva Toguri, accused of having
been "Tokyo Rose" during World War
II and convicted of treason in 1949,
was long overdue.
Toguri's conviction was tainted
with perjured testimony, jingoistic
rhetoric, bungled investigations and
biased jurists. Even her prosecutor
admitted she wasn't a traitor.
In fact, she was a woman who found
herself stuck in Japan after Pearl Har
bor because of bureaucratic idiocy.
She took a post with Radio Tokyo and
served as an agent of American and
Australian prisoners of war attempting
to sabotage the Japanese propaganda
effort.
But more important than one indi
vidual's guilt or innocence is the prob
lem of reconciling laws against treason
with freedom of speech. We believe
Toguri had the right to speak her mind
against American policy without fear
of being convicted as a traitor.
Ford displayed courage in his act
. of pardon. That act, however, cannot
make up for 30 years of estrangement
; from her native land.

Obvious differences
I am writing this letter in support of
Stephen Carter's position on affirma
tive action (Daily, Jan. 3).
Minority people are different than
white people. No one can tell me that
the native American people living
here on the Northern Cheyenne Reser
vation are similar to people living in
Palo Alto and San Jose. There are some
striking differences.
One of the most obvious distinctions
is language. People here would rather
speak Cheyenne. In many instances,
English cannot adequately communi
cate an idea.

Living on a reservation is not the
same as growing up in Hillsborough or
Milpitas. Here, you do not find an en
vironment replete with theaters, lib
raries, museums and art galleries. In
stead, you are confronted with an envi
ronment where conditions are rather
harsh. P'or example, the unemploy
ment rate on the Northern Cheyenne
Reservation is currently around 60 per
cent.
Services which urban dwellers take
for granted are not so easily found on a
reservation. If you should require
emergency medical care you would
have a 100 mile ride ahead of you.

I realize that this country is sick and
tired of hearing about native American
problems. But until this nation lives
up to the true meaning of its name the
complaints shall and must continue.
