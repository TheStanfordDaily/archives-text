# In defense of Gray

I'd like to commend Ray Thomas for
his column entitled "Virgins Have
Rights, Too" (Daily, Jan. 19), which
was an eloquent attack on a viewpoint
which clearly deserves the censure.
However, in his eagerness to defend
the uninitiated, Thomas attacked a far
larger and far more powerful group at
Stanford: assholes. Given Thomas'
self-proclaimed virgin status, I suspect
that he was too innocent to recognize
any of the vicious implications of his
column.
As ASSistant to the president of As
sholes Need Undeserved Support
(ANUS), I find it incumbent upon my
self to set the record straight. Although
I live down the hall from Thomas, I
have nothing to do with any virgins.
Thomas, rather insensitively,
labeled Chris Gray "devirginized" for
his witty putdown of the sexist
Chaparral. We at ANUS, with all due
respect to Thomas, would like to argue
that Gray's "devirgined" status was
undeserved. We defend Gray's right to
print unfounded accusations against
the Chaparral in a publication unre
lated to the dispute:the Stanford Daily.
Simply because Gray failed to turn
in the schedule of his Radical Film
Series to the Chaparral until the day it
went to press does not deny him the

right to slander the Chapurrui. Simply
because the failure of the Chaparral to
print his schedule was Gray's honest
mistake rather than, as he implies in
his clever and original little quiz, the
Chaparral's mistake, does not deny
Gray the right to act self-righteous.
After all, don't we all have the right
to be assholes at least once in awhile?
Members of our organization are just
as distinguished as members of
Thomas' group. They include the 37th
president of the United States, mem
bers of the ASSU Senate, a former gov
ernor of California who once starred in
Bonzo movies (not the chimp) and
those who helped make our savioui
the most famous martyr in history.
I should point out that Gray is not, as
yet, a member of ANUS. I write this
only from a deep-seated sympathy foi
his cause. While recognizing the an
guish which Thomas' callous and in
sensitive attack on Gray's admirably
clever little letter must have caused
Gray, we do wish to assuage some ol
the pain by making Gray an honorary
member of our society.
So welcome to our club, Chris, and
remember that behind every great man
there is an asshole.
