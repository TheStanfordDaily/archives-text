# University to attempt cut in use of water
## 
### Ted Hamilton Staff writer 
The university is preparing to
launch a water conservation prog
ram sometime next week, accord
ing to Plant Services Director Jason
Mavis.
The program is in response to the
recent drought that has plagued the
state, Mavis said.
Although details were not re
vealed, Mavis indicated that the
university could increase its con
trol of water use in landscape irriga
tion and particularly in the
laboratories by making sure as
pirators are turned off when not in
use.
"A great deal has already been
done, especially in student living
quarters," Mavis said. He referred
specifically to the reduced hot
water flow in the showers.
According to the acting general
manager of the San Francisco Water

Department, Kenneth Boyd, the
drought has forced the water de
partment to ask San Francisco and
surrounding midpeninsula com
munities, including the university,
to reduce water consumption by 10
per cent.
The San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission will be asked
to authorize the water department's
voluntary conservation program
tomorrow, and its approval is ex
pected, Boyd said.
"There is an absolute need to re
duce water use by 10 per cent,"
Boyd said.
The Hetch-Hetchy reservoir,
which supplies the water for San
Francisco and most of the mid
peninsula communities, has re
ceived only 40 per cent of its annual
rain and snowpack.
It public reaction to the voluntary
conservation program does not re
sult in the desired 10 per cent re

duction, the San Francisco Water
Department may have to enforce
reductive measures, Boyd said.
He said reductive measures could
mean raising water prices, an alter
native Mavis fears may be used.
"I expect to see some pricing
done," Mavis said.
As it stands, the San Francisco
Water Department already has a
proposed 20 per cent rate increase
pending before the San Francisco
Public Utilities Commission, which
if approved will go before the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors,
Boyd explained.
Recently, the university has been
more concerned with the conserva
tion of natural gas, fuel oil and elec
tricity, and is now beginning to
concentrate its efforts in water con
servation, Mavis said.
"We've had years and years of
plenty . . . now it's a whole new set
of engineering problems," Mavis
said.
