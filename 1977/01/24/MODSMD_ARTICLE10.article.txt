# Pornography reveals society's sexism
## 
### 
Pornography has been discounted as
a causal factor in sex crimes. No longer
viewed as a threat to law and order,
pornography is now a big business in
the marketplace.
Criticizing pornography is passe.
Opposition to it brings smugly per
missive snickers or indulgent chuck
les from one's peers.
After all, pornography has been
proven safe for human consumption*.
No Hustler-crazed male, the surgeon
general has affirmed, will run berserk
through the streets, raping and assault
ing. So pornography is harmless,
right?
Wrong. The harmfulness of pornog
raphy is its very essence — the oppres
sion and exploitation of women. It is
the female body, remember, which is
most often the target of pornography.
It should surprise no one that the
pornography business, which
specializes in the exploitation of the
female, is dominated by males. There
are few women producers, directors,
exhibitors or owners of "dirty movies"
or "dirty book stores." There are few
women who write pornography. The
only place in the business where
women are found in numbers is before
the camera, legs spread.
More women?
One wonders why more women are
not producing these films themselves,
or writing the literature. The answer is
that pornography is primarily a male
interest, and its content is designed to
appeal to male sexuality, not to female.
Plot after pornographic plot centers
around victimization of the female.
Abduction, rape, sadism — these fea
tures characterize most "dirty" books

and films.
As kinkiness gains acceptance with
the public, brutality toward women
becomes increasingly emphasized in
pornography. Women are even made
to appear to enjoy their oppression and
the violence committed against them,
as in The Story of O and Oh, It Hurts So

Good.
Perhaps the key to understanding
why victimization and violence to
ward women are such popular themes
in pornography can be found in the
fact that male domination of the female
is nowhere more "up front" than in
this genre. Much of male sexuality, at
least of the traditional sort, focuses on
"conquest," "banging," "sticking it
to." Power is the issue here, not sexual
ity. Physical dominance overshadows
sensual pleasure.
The more brutal the attack upon the
woman, the more pornography makes
the woman seem to enjoy it.
Scars
The wealth of testimony from rape
victims overwhelmingly affirms the
fact that physical attack is a far from
pleasurable experience and that, in
fact, it can leave emotional and some

times physical scars that last a lifetime.
Why, then, is the fantasy that women
enjoy pain still sq much a part of the
pornographic literature?
It is still there because many males
wish to justify their own desires to in
flict pain, to assert domination. And, if
anything, the fantasy is expanding,
being incorporated into more and
more pornographic forms and even
spilling over into "mainstream" fic
tion and films.
Aside from the brutal aspect of por
nography, there is another source of
harm in it. That is to the psyches of
millions of grown women and young
children. How comfortable does the
average woman feel standing in line at
a college bookstore, a supermarket or
drug store when magazine racks next
to her display in living color her
breasts and genitals?
Commodity
Oh, of course they do not belong to
her, the individual woman, but they
are like her own. There is a body, just
like hers, being sold as a commodity.
How much greater is her discomfort
when the man standing next to her,
intently staring at the magazine cover,
looks up and stares at her?
How comfortable does the average
woman feel when her child brings her
the movie section of the newspaper,
asking, "Mommy, why does this
woman in the picture have a chain on
her neck?"
Pornography may not actually cause
sex crimes. Most probably it does not.
But it does strengthen society's at
titude that women are sex objects to be
beaten, raped, "gotten and forgotten."
It strengthens the attitude that a wo

man's body is not her own but is a
commodity to be sold, ogled, oppres
sed and exploited.
There does not seem to be much, if
any pornography aimed at women as
consumers. (Playgirl and Viva sell
more copies to gay males than to
women and even in these magazines,
male fantasies predominate.)
Perhaps some day a female form of
pornography will spring up. And on
that day, perhaps the themes will be of
mutual pleasure, affection, gentle sen
suality and respect.

Pornography has been discounted as
a causal factor in sex crimes. No longer
viewed as a threat to law and order,
pornography is now a big business in
the marketplace.
Criticizing pornography is passe.
Opposition to it brings smugly per
missive snickers or indulgent chuck
les from one's peers.
After all, pornography has been
proven safe for human consumption*.
No Hustler-crazed male, the surgeon
general has affirmed, will run berserk
through the streets, raping and assault
ing. So pornography is harmless,
right?
Wrong. The harmfulness of pornog
raphy is its very essence — the oppres
sion and exploitation of women. It is
the female body, remember, which is
most often the target of pornography.
It should surprise no one that the
pornography business, which
specializes in the exploitation of the
female, is dominated by males. There
are few women producers, directors,
exhibitors or owners of "dirty movies"
or "dirty book stores." There are few
women who write pornography. The
only place in the business where
women are found in numbers is before
the camera, legs spread.
More women?
One wonders why more women are
not producing these films themselves,
or writing the literature. The answer is
that pornography is primarily a male
interest, and its content is designed to
appeal to male sexuality, not to female.
Plot after pornographic plot centers
around victimization of the female.
Abduction, rape, sadism — these fea
tures characterize most "dirty" books

and films.
As kinkiness gains acceptance with
the public, brutality toward women
becomes increasingly emphasized in
pornography. Women are even made
to appear to enjoy their oppression and
the violence committed against them,
as in The Story of O and Oh, It Hurts So

Good.
Perhaps the key to understanding
why victimization and violence to
ward women are such popular themes
in pornography can be found in the
fact that male domination of the female
is nowhere more "up front" than in
this genre. Much of male sexuality, at
least of the traditional sort, focuses on
"conquest," "banging," "sticking it
to." Power is the issue here, not sexual
ity. Physical dominance overshadows
sensual pleasure.
The more brutal the attack upon the
woman, the more pornography makes
the woman seem to enjoy it.
Scars
The wealth of testimony from rape
victims overwhelmingly affirms the
fact that physical attack is a far from
pleasurable experience and that, in
fact, it can leave emotional and some

times physical scars that last a lifetime.
Why, then, is the fantasy that women
enjoy pain still sq much a part of the
pornographic literature?
It is still there because many males
wish to justify their own desires to in
flict pain, to assert domination. And, if
anything, the fantasy is expanding,
being incorporated into more and
more pornographic forms and even
spilling over into "mainstream" fic
tion and films.
Aside from the brutal aspect of por
nography, there is another source of
harm in it. That is to the psyches of
millions of grown women and young
children. How comfortable does the
average woman feel standing in line at
a college bookstore, a supermarket or
drug store when magazine racks next
to her display in living color her
breasts and genitals?
Commodity
Oh, of course they do not belong to
her, the individual woman, but they
are like her own. There is a body, just
like hers, being sold as a commodity.
How much greater is her discomfort
when the man standing next to her,
intently staring at the magazine cover,
looks up and stares at her?
How comfortable does the average
woman feel when her child brings her
the movie section of the newspaper,
asking, "Mommy, why does this
woman in the picture have a chain on
her neck?"
Pornography may not actually cause
sex crimes. Most probably it does not.
But it does strengthen society's at
titude that women are sex objects to be
beaten, raped, "gotten and forgotten."
It strengthens the attitude that a wo

man's body is not her own but is a

her, the individual woman, but they
are like her own. There is a body, just
like hers, being sold as a commodity.
How much greater is her discomfort
when the man standing next to her,
intently staring at the magazine cover,
looks up and stares at her?
How comfortable does the average
woman feel when her child brings her
the movie section of the newspaper,
asking, "Mommy, why does this
woman in the picture have a chain on
her neck?"
Pornography may not actually cause
sex crimes. Most probably it does not.
But it does strengthen society's at
titude that women are sex objects to be
beaten, raped, "gotten and forgotten."
It strengthens the attitude that a wo

man's body is not her own but is a
commodity to be sold, ogled, oppres
sed and exploited.
There does not seem to be much, if
any pornography aimed at women as
consumers. (Playgirl and Viva sell
more copies to gay males than to
women and even in these magazines,
male fantasies predominate.)
Perhaps some day a female form of
pornography will spring up. And on
that day, perhaps the themes will be of
mutual pleasure, affection, gentle sen
suality and respect.
