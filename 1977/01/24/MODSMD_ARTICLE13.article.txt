"China will not be as re
volutionary as Mao had hoped,
but neither will it be as non
revolutionary as he had feared,"
Asst. Political Science Prof.
Harry Harding said Thursday af
ternoon during his talk, "China
After Mao — The End of the Re
volution?"
Harding, speaking to more
than one hundred people in
Branner Lounge, discussed his
recent trip to China during
which mass demonstrations
against the "Cang of Four" took
place.
Although word of the bitter
struggle inside China between
the radicals and the moderates
had reached the West, Harding
said, and it appeared to obser
vers of China that Mao had cho
sen his successor, Hua Kuo-feng,
"it was as if China hadn't heard
the news about what was hap

pening inside of China."
At 6 a.m., Oct. 21 in Peking,
Harding said he watched the
start of a small demonstration.
As the day progressed, the
number of people swelled to
amazing proportions as
truckloads of people began to ar
rive.
"We saw what a demonstra
tion meant for China. ... It is es
timated that 1.5 million people
demonstrated that day, 1.8 mill
ion the following day and 2.3
million the day after in an
enormous display of the organi
zation and mobilization charac
teristic of the People's Republic
of China."
Harding's group,'returning by
bus from a field trip, was unable
to move because of the crush of
people.
Martial music, wall to wall
people lining the streets, signs,
banners and portraits vehe

mently denouncing the Cang of
Four led by Mao's widow,
Chiang Ching, contributed to a
scene that although "extraordi
narily impressive, was in some
ways disquieting."
While cautioning that care is
necessary to avoid a premature
diagnosis of the situation, Hard
ing said he believes Chairman
Hua is in a perilous position.
"Hua as a centrist runs the risk
of being caught in the classic
squeeze play unable to please
either faction and could fall vic
tim to the struggle between the
two. ... Hua try as he may, is not
a Mao and probably never will
be."
Harding also said he does not
foresee a decreasing emphasis
on egalitarianism since the
Chinese economic system is de
pendent upon an egalitarian pol
icy.

against the "Cang of Four" took
place.
Although word of the bitter
struggle inside China between
the radicals and the moderates
had reached the West, Harding
said, and it appeared to obser
vers of China that Mao had cho
sen his successor, Hua Kuo-feng,
"it was as if China hadn't heard
the news about what was hap

pening inside of China."
At 6 a.m., Oct. 21 in Peking,
Harding said he watched the
start of a small demonstration.
As the day progressed, the
number of people swelled to
amazing proportions as
truckloads of people began to ar
rive.
"We saw what a demonstra
tion meant for China. ... It is es
timated that 1.5 million people
demonstrated that day, 1.8 mill
ion the following day and 2.3
million the day after in an
enormous display of the organi
zation and mobilization charac
teristic of the People's Republic
of China."
Harding's group,'returning by
bus from a field trip, was unable
to move because of the crush of
people.
Martial music, wall to wall
people lining the streets, signs,
banners and portraits vehe

mently denouncing the Cang of
Four led by Mao's widow,
Chiang Ching, contributed to a
scene that although "extraordi
narily impressive, was in some
ways disquieting."
While cautioning that care is
necessary to avoid a premature
diagnosis of the situation, Hard
ing said he believes Chairman
Hua is in a perilous position.
"Hua as a centrist runs the risk
of being caught in the classic
squeeze play unable to please
either faction and could fall vic
tim to the struggle between the
two. ... Hua try as he may, is not
a Mao and probably never will
be."
Harding also said he does not
foresee a decreasing emphasis
on egalitarianism since the
Chinese economic system is de
pendent upon an egalitarian pol
icy.
