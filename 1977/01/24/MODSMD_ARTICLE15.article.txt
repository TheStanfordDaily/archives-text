## Stanford alum makes good Watson wins Crosby title 
### Chris Baker 
Pebble Beach — Tom Watson
picked up his golf ball and threw
it into the bright blue waters of
the Pacific Ocean. He walked
over and kissed his lovely wife
Linda who had been following
him around all day.
Watson, class of 1971, won the
36th annual Bing Crosby
Pro-Am Golf Tournament by just
one stroke over British golfer
Tony Jacklin.
Watson shot a one under par
71 and recorded a 14 under par
72 hole total of 273. Watson was
quite familiar with the treacher
ous Pebble Beach course where
the final round of the "clam
bake" traditionally finishes up.
"Winning the Crosby means a
heck of a lot," said Watson.
"This feels like my backyard. 1
remember when I used to get up
at 5:30 in the morning and drive
down here from Stanford so that
1 could play all day. A guy would
let me play for free."
Just then a member of the
media asked Watson if he ever
went to class at Stanford.
"Only on Saturday," joked
Watson. "I have to be honest."
The Crosby victory was Wat
son's third win since he joined
the PGA tour. Watson, who col
lected $40,000 for his victory
yesterday, has now won
$579,009. He won the Byron
Nelson Classic in 1975 and, of
course, the British Open in 1974.

"God damn it's beautiful,"
said Watson, who broke the
Crosby tournament record by
four strokes. "1 haven't been this
happy since I was married. But it
doesn't mean as much (breaking
the record) with this type of
weather. We couldn't have asked
for nicer weather for the last four
days. This course is very diffe
rent with no wind."
Watson entered yesterday's
final round of the Crosby with a
one stroke lead over Jacklin, the
1971 U.S. Open champion, who
carded a 68 at Cypress Point
while Watson finished with a 67
at Monterey Peninsula.
Saturday the PGA's newest
member attracted the largest
crowds. Gerald Ford, only two
days removed from the presi
dency, was removed from the
Crosby field when he and his
professional partner Arnold
Palmer failed to make the cut.
But he still attracted the largest
galleries.
But it was a different story
today as Watson and Jacklin had
the crowd behind them.
"There must have been 1000
camera clicks on my back
swing," Watson said. "The round
today had tremendous pressure.
I was fighting my inner self all
day.
"I felt that if I kept on swing
ing the way that 1 had been sw
inging all week I would win. 1
was a little bit tight and I was

choking like hell but my swing
held up. The apprehension of
being in the lead didn't bother
me."
On the notorious eighteenth
hole — 540 yards over rocks and
the water — Watson just missed
putting the ball into the drink
but it sliced to the left and Wat
son was assured of the top prize
money.
Jacklin, whose foursome was
playing just ahead of Watson's
missed a putt that might have
sent the Crosby into a playoff.
"I hit a four iron on that shot
and the wind blew it left," said
Watson of his near choke on the
final hole of the Crosby.
Watson felt that the crucial
moment of the tournament was
when Jacklin missed a two footer
on the final hole.
"It he had made that I might
have played it differently," said
Watson.
Jacklin didn't seem too de
jected about missing the putt al

though it was worth $17,200.
"I would have like to have
made that putt but 1 was pleased
with the way 1 played. Tom ob
viously played well."
Watson credited the im
provement in his game to golfing
great Byron Nelson.
"I owe a lot to a gentleman
who used to work for ABC —
Byron Nelson. After I won the
British Open he talked to me anil
told me if 1 ever needed some
help to call him. 1 went down to
Dallas last year. I feel very fortu
nate to have as knowledgeable a
teacher as Byron."
Watson will go to San Diego
next weekend and then play in
the Hawaiian Open. He will also
try to regain the British Open
title the second week in July.
Jacklin took home $22,H00 for
his four day total of 274. bee
Elder, the first black to play in the
Master's, finished third with a 72
hole total of 275. Elder will take
home $14,200 for his efforts.

Former President Gerald Ford teamed up with professional
golfer Arnold Palmer in the Crosby Golf Tourney in Pebble
Beach last weekend. Ford had the largest gallery of any golfer
and withstood the pressure from camera bugs as well as na
tional television coverage.
Pebble Beach — Tom Watson
picked up his golf ball and threw
it into the bright blue waters of
the Pacific Ocean. He walked
over and kissed his lovely wife
Linda who had been following
him around all day.
Watson, class of 1971, won the
36th annual Bing Crosby
Pro-Am Golf Tournament by just
one stroke over British golfer
Tony Jacklin.
Watson shot a one under par
71 and recorded a 14 under par
72 hole total of 273. Watson was
quite familiar with the treacher
ous Pebble Beach course where
the final round of the "clam
bake" traditionally finishes up.
"Winning the Crosby means a
heck of a lot," said Watson.
"This feels like my backyard. 1
remember when I used to get up
at 5:30 in the morning and drive
down here from Stanford so that
1 could play all day. A guy would
let me play for free."
Just then a member of the
media asked Watson if he ever
went to class at Stanford.
"Only on Saturday," joked
Watson. "I have to be honest."
The Crosby victory was Wat
son's third win since he joined
the PGA tour. Watson, who col
lected $40,000 for his victory
yesterday, has now won
$579,009. He won the Byron
Nelson Classic in 1975 and, of
course, the British Open in 1974.

"God damn it's beautiful,"
said Watson, who broke the
Crosby tournament record by
four strokes. "1 haven't been this
happy since I was married. But it
doesn't mean as much (breaking
the record) with this type of
weather. We couldn't have asked
for nicer weather for the last four
days. This course is very diffe
rent with no wind."
Watson entered yesterday's
final round of the Crosby with a
one stroke lead over Jacklin, the
1971 U.S. Open champion, who
carded a 68 at Cypress Point
while Watson finished with a 67
at Monterey Peninsula.
Saturday the PGA's newest
member attracted the largest
crowds. Gerald Ford, only two
days removed from the presi
dency, was removed from the
Crosby field when he and his
professional partner Arnold
Palmer failed to make the cut.
But he still attracted the largest
galleries.
But it was a different story
today as Watson and Jacklin had
the crowd behind them.
"There must have been 1000
camera clicks on my back
swing," Watson said. "The round
today had tremendous pressure.
I was fighting my inner self all
day.
"I felt that if I kept on swing
ing the way that 1 had been sw
inging all week I would win. 1
was a little bit tight and I was

choking like hell but my swing
held up. The apprehension of
being in the lead didn't bother
me."
On the notorious eighteenth
hole — 540 yards over rocks and
the water — Watson just missed
putting the ball into the drink
but it sliced to the left and Wat
son was assured of the top prize
money.
Jacklin, whose foursome was
playing just ahead of Watson's
missed a putt that might have
sent the Crosby into a playoff.
"I hit a four iron on that shot
and the wind blew it left," said
Watson of his near choke on the
final hole of the Crosby.
Watson felt that the crucial
moment of the tournament was
when Jacklin missed a two footer
on the final hole.
"It he had made that I might
have played it differently," said
Watson.
Jacklin didn't seem too de
jected about missing the putt al

though it was worth $17,200.
"I would have like to have
made that putt but 1 was pleased
with the way 1 played. Tom ob
viously played well."
Watson credited the im
provement in his game to golfing
great Byron Nelson.
"I owe a lot to a gentleman
who used to work for ABC —
Byron Nelson. After I won the
British Open he talked to me anil
told me if 1 ever needed some
help to call him. 1 went down to
Dallas last year. I feel very fortu
nate to have as knowledgeable a
teacher as Byron."
Watson will go to San Diego
next weekend and then play in
the Hawaiian Open. He will also
try to regain the British Open
title the second week in July.

though it was worth $17,200.
"I would have like to have
made that putt but 1 was pleased
with the way 1 played. Tom ob
viously played well."
Watson credited the im
provement in his game to golfing
great Byron Nelson.
"I owe a lot to a gentleman
who used to work for ABC —
Byron Nelson. After I won the
British Open he talked to me anil
told me if 1 ever needed some
help to call him. 1 went down to
Dallas last year. I feel very fortu
nate to have as knowledgeable a
teacher as Byron."
Watson will go to San Diego
next weekend and then play in
the Hawaiian Open. He will also
try to regain the British Open
title the second week in July.
Jacklin took home $22,H00 for
his four day total of 274. bee
Elder, the first black to play in the
Master's, finished third with a 72
hole total of 275. Elder will take
home $14,200 for his efforts.

Former President Gerald Ford teamed up with professional
golfer Arnold Palmer in the Crosby Golf Tourney in Pebble
Beach last weekend. Ford had the largest gallery of any golfer
and withstood the pressure from camera bugs as well as na
tional television coverage.
Pebble Beach — Tom Watson
picked up his golf ball and threw
it into the bright blue waters of
the Pacific Ocean. He walked
over and kissed his lovely wife
Linda who had been following
him around all day.
Watson, class of 1971, won the
36th annual Bing Crosby
Pro-Am Golf Tournament by just
one stroke over British golfer
Tony Jacklin.
Watson shot a one under par
71 and recorded a 14 under par
72 hole total of 273. Watson was
quite familiar with the treacher
ous Pebble Beach course where
the final round of the "clam
bake" traditionally finishes up.
"Winning the Crosby means a
heck of a lot," said Watson.
"This feels like my backyard. 1
remember when I used to get up
at 5:30 in the morning and drive
down here from Stanford so that
1 could play all day. A guy would
let me play for free."
Just then a member of the
media asked Watson if he ever
went to class at Stanford.
"Only on Saturday," joked
Watson. "I have to be honest."
The Crosby victory was Wat
son's third win since he joined
the PGA tour. Watson, who col
lected $40,000 for his victory
yesterday, has now won
$579,009. He won the Byron
Nelson Classic in 1975 and, of
course, the British Open in 1974.

"God damn it's beautiful,"
said Watson, who broke the
Crosby tournament record by
four strokes. "1 haven't been this
happy since I was married. But it
doesn't mean as much (breaking
the record) with this type of
weather. We couldn't have asked
for nicer weather for the last four
days. This course is very diffe
rent with no wind."
Watson entered yesterday's
final round of the Crosby with a
one stroke lead over Jacklin, the
1971 U.S. Open champion, who
carded a 68 at Cypress Point
while Watson finished with a 67
at Monterey Peninsula.
Saturday the PGA's newest
member attracted the largest
crowds. Gerald Ford, only two
days removed from the presi
dency, was removed from the
Crosby field when he and his
professional partner Arnold
Palmer failed to make the cut.
But he still attracted the largest
galleries.
But it was a different story
today as Watson and Jacklin had
the crowd behind them.
"There must have been 1000
camera clicks on my back
swing," Watson said. "The round
today had tremendous pressure.
I was fighting my inner self all
day.
"I felt that if I kept on swing
ing the way that 1 had been sw
inging all week I would win. 1
was a little bit tight and I was

choking like hell but my swing
held up. The apprehension of
being in the lead didn't bother
me."
On the notorious eighteenth
hole — 540 yards over rocks and
the water — Watson just missed
putting the ball into the drink
but it sliced to the left and Wat
son was assured of the top prize
money.
Jacklin, whose foursome was
playing just ahead of Watson's
missed a putt that might have
sent the Crosby into a playoff.
"I hit a four iron on that shot
and the wind blew it left," said
Watson of his near choke on the
final hole of the Crosby.
Watson felt that the crucial
moment of the tournament was
when Jacklin missed a two footer
on the final hole.
"It he had made that I might
have played it differently," said
Watson.
Jacklin didn't seem too de
jected about missing the putt al

though it was worth $17,200.
"I would have like to have
made that putt but 1 was pleased
with the way 1 played. Tom ob
viously played well."
