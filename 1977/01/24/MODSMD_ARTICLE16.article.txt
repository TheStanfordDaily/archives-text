# Globetrotters dazzle crowd
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Billed as "The World's
Greatest Family Entertainment,"
the Harlem Globetrotters left no
doubts in the minds of the near
sellout crowd who watched their
antics last Friday night in
Maples Pavillion.
For the second year, the
Globetrotters were the honored
guests of the Stanford Club
Sports Council, who presented
the "Harlequins of the
Hardwood" as a tundraising
event. The council handles the
funding of inter-collegiate teams
not competing on the varsity
level. Danny Schley, a represen
tative of the council, said that the
group hopes to raise $15,000 to
finance the 13 clubs for next sea
son's competition.
The sports which receive sup
port include ice hockey, lac
rosse, cycling, women's soccer,

men's and women's crew, ski
ing, cricket and martial arts.
In the 50 years of organized
play, the Globetrotters have en
tertained an unbelievable 82
million fans. Watching the care
fully executed routines and the
infectious laughter which they
inspire, one can hardly imagine
anything but good times for the
Globetrotters. However, they
have come a long way from the
days of packing five players in
an old Ford to the present 35
man roster, traveling 75,000
miles with 180 stops on this tour.
Begun in 1927, the Globetrot
ters evolved from a Chicago
black semipro team. The team
had been renamed the "Savoy
Big Five" and were coached by a
24-year-old Abe Saperstein.
Flaying games on the ballroom
dance floor in Chicago's Savoy
Hotel, the team didn't draw

crowds large enough to pay the
players' salaries.
To save five cents a word on
telegrams to arrange bookings,
the team named changed from
Harlem New York Globetrotters
to the more familiar Harlem
Globetrotters. Scores rarely ap
peared in print so there was no
reputation to rely on as the Trot
ters traveled from town to town.
The big break for the Globe
trotters didn't come until 11)40
when they beat the national
champion New York Renais
sance team and won $1000 prize
money and therefore gained
publicity.
Then in 1946, the Globetrot
ters took a "foreign trip" — to
Hawaii. Letters spread the word
like wildfire across the nation, as
relatives heard the stories of the
court clowns whose talent had
the talent which allowed them to
razzle-dazzle opponents.

Maples Pavillion.
For the second year, the
Globetrotters were the honored
guests of the Stanford Club
Sports Council, who presented
the "Harlequins of the
Hardwood" as a tundraising
event. The council handles the
funding of inter-collegiate teams
not competing on the varsity
level. Danny Schley, a represen
tative of the council, said that the
group hopes to raise $15,000 to
finance the 13 clubs for next sea
son's competition.
The sports which receive sup
port include ice hockey, lac
rosse, cycling, women's soccer,

men's and women's crew, ski
ing, cricket and martial arts.
In the 50 years of organized
play, the Globetrotters have en
tertained an unbelievable 82
million fans. Watching the care
fully executed routines and the
infectious laughter which they
inspire, one can hardly imagine
anything but good times for the
Globetrotters. However, they
have come a long way from the
days of packing five players in
an old Ford to the present 35
man roster, traveling 75,000
miles with 180 stops on this tour.
Begun in 1927, the Globetrot
ters evolved from a Chicago
black semipro team. The team
had been renamed the "Savoy
Big Five" and were coached by a
24-year-old Abe Saperstein.
Flaying games on the ballroom
dance floor in Chicago's Savoy
Hotel, the team didn't draw

crowds large enough to pay the
players' salaries.
To save five cents a word on
telegrams to arrange bookings,
the team named changed from
Harlem New York Globetrotters
to the more familiar Harlem
Globetrotters. Scores rarely ap
peared in print so there was no
reputation to rely on as the Trot
ters traveled from town to town.
The big break for the Globe
trotters didn't come until 11)40
when they beat the national
champion New York Renais
sance team and won $1000 prize
money and therefore gained
publicity.
Then in 1946, the Globetrot
ters took a "foreign trip" — to
Hawaii. Letters spread the word
like wildfire across the nation, as
relatives heard the stories of the
court clowns whose talent had
the talent which allowed them to
razzle-dazzle opponents.
Billed as "The World's
Greatest Family Entertainment,"
the Harlem Globetrotters left no
doubts in the minds of the near
sellout crowd who watched their
antics last Friday night in
Maples Pavillion.
