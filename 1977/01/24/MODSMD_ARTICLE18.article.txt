## Lofton outjumps Olympic gold medalist 
### Bruce Anderson 
The pre-meet publicity for the
San Francisco Examiner Indoor
Games billed the long jump
competition as a matchup bet
ween the last two Olympic gold
medalists in that event, Randy
Williams and Arnie Robinson.
Williams didn't show up.
Robinson should have followed
suit.
Stanford's James Lofton up
ended the Olympic champion
with a single jump.
Thirteen thousand track en
thusiasts crowded the Cow
Palace Friday night to view Lof
ton and hundreds of other
athletes compete in the 14th An
nual Examiner Games. The
near-capacity crowd witnessed
pole vaulter Mike Tulley set a
meet record by clearing 17-8 (for
his effort the UCLA junior was
named athlete of the meet), saw
Al Feuerback win his fourth
Examiner Games shot put title
and watched as Paul Cummings
failed in his bid to become the
first miler to break four minutes
indoors in San Francisco.
It remained for Lofton, how
ever, to provide Bay Area track
enthusiasts with the biggest
upset of the evening. Taking up
where he left off last spring

when he finished third in the
NCAA finals and fifth in the U.S.
Olympic Trials, Lofton cracked a
25-7 leap on his first jump of the
new track season.
The junior from Los Angeles
fouled or passed on the remain
der of his jumps, but his initial
mark held when Robinson's best
effort produced a second-place
leap of 24-9V«.
"The runway was too short
and I'm not in good shape yet,"
Robinson said, searching for a
way to explain his defeat. He
added graciously, "I got beat by a
better person, that's all there is to
it."
The Olympic champion, rated
the No. 1 long jumper in the
world during most of the '70s,
said, "I think James is a very fan
tastic jumper."
The jumping veteran said, "To
be the best, he (Lofton) has to
jump with the best. He has to
jump more often with me and
Randy. ... I think James could
win the gold medal in 1980."
"I'm faster now than 1 was in
June," Lofton said. "I was in ex
cellent condition, physically
and mentally, tonight."
Lofton's leap was not only
good for a gold medal and a tele
vision set, it set a Stanford in

door mark, easily surpassing the
old record of 24-4V2 set by Bud
Walsh in 1966.
Shot putter Terry Albritton
also set a Stanford mark with his
fourth-place put of 64-9 3 /4. Al
britton received eligibility con
firmation from Pacific-8 faculty
representatives just hours before
the meet. Feuerbach won the
competition with a toss of 66-
11%.
Another veteran of the
Examiner Games, Stanford track
coach Payton Jordan, ably de
fended his masters'6o-yard dash
title running to the most con
vincing victory of the meet.
Jordan won the sprint with a
7.1 clocking, seven-tenths of a
second ahead of nearest rival.
Stanford engineering professor
Bill Fairbank finished fourth in
8.1 and representing the U.S.
Senate, Stanford alumnus Alan
Cranston finished sixth in 8.3.
Jordan ran well. So did the
Cardinal tracksters who practice
under his knowledgeable eye.
Stanford's mile relay team held
the lead through the first three
legs of the university mile relay

competition as Tom Shellworth
and Paul McCarthy held the lead
given them by Alan Sheats after
the first leg.
Lofton, just through long
jumping, received the baton for
the anchor leg with several yards
of space between himself and
San Jose State's Dedy Cooper.
But Cooper, the defending
NCAA high hurdles champion,
edged Lofton to give the Spar
tans a 3:24.3 victory. Stanford
finished second in 3:24.6.
Senior Steve Crowley, a late
entrant in the Devil-Take-The-
Hindmost Mile, ran an intelli
gent race, taking the lead on the
last lap to win in 4:21.3.
Stanford graduate students
also ran well Friday night. In the
mile, Mike Boit shadowed
Cummings the last five laps
around the 160-yard oval, but
wasn't able to pass the Brigham
Young alumnus. He finished
second in 4:02.8.
Paul Geis finished third in the
3000-meter run with a 8:09.2
clocking and Rich Nichols
placed third in the 600-meter
run with a 1:21.2 showing.
