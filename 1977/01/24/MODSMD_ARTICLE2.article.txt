# Students urge Carter to down B-1 bomber
## 
### Marc Strassman 
A four-hour vigil in White Plaza protesting the production of the B-l bomber
was one of 110 such demonstrations organized across the country on Friday.
One hundred postcards and a letter signed by 458 persons requesting that
President Jimmy Carter cancel production of the B-l strategic bomber system
were collected, according to Tom Wainwright, one of the campus organizers of
the Committee to Drop the B-l Bomber.
Wainwright said the vigil here was only "one of 110" nationwide demonstra
tions organized by the National B-l Bomber Peace Conversion Campaign,
which is being coordinated by the American Friends Service Committee and
Clergy and Laity Concerned.
"Five or six hundred people came by our table," said Wainwright. "and it
surprised me that most people were as knowledgeable as they were. A majority
of people who were knowledgeable signed our letter."
"Only one or two (persons) started arguing," he said. One of them claimed
that "the B-l was necessary because it was recallable." he added.
The Committee to Drop the B-l has prepared a leaflet outlining its reasons for
opposing development of the weapon system. Total cost for 224 of the swing
wing planes is estimated to be around $22 billion dollars or around $100
million per plane.
According to the leaflet, the money for "a single B-l would about pay the full
tuition for everybody at Stanford for two years."
Besides its cost, opponents of the B-l argue in their leaflet that the plane
escalates the arms race without increasing national security, and that it poses
an environmental threat.
They also say the B-l would profit a limited number of large defense contrac
tors. such as Boeing. C.eneral Electric and Rockwell International, while in
creasing the average citizen's tax burden and leaving more essential social
programs unfunded.
Wainwright said he was "really not sure" whether Carter would decide to go
ahead with the B-l program. He said he expected the president to make the
derision relatively soon.
