Mondale begins European visit
Brussels, Belgium — Vice President Walter Mondale
arrived yesterday in Brussels on the first diplomatic mis
sion of the new Carter administration. He will visit Ameri
ca's major allies.
The vice president is on a 10-day global trip that will
take him to five European capitals and Tokyo for
economic discussions and introductory talks.
In a brief arrival statement, Mondale said he would tell
Belgian leaders that the United States seeks "a relation
ship in which ideas flow both ways across the Atlantic and
all are involved in leadership."
"President Carter supports the integration of Europe
and a productive dialogue between the United States and
the European Community Common Market — and with
our NATO partners as well as European friends not in the
community," he said.
The vice president's agenda in Brussels includes meet
ings today with Belgian Prime Minister Leo Tindemans
and officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Common Market.
British economy on upswing after loan
London — Three weeks after Britain obtained a $3.9
billion loan from the International Monetary Eund, the
economy is showing pronounced signs of recovery. But
critical obstacles remain.

The beleaguered pound sterling, the world's mightiest
currency in centuries past, has halted its slide on the
foreign exchanges and crept back slightly to more than
$1.71 after hitting an all-time low of $1.57 on Oct. 28.
After many months with a balance of payments deficit,
the country has posted December figures showing a favor
able balance in trade with the rest of the world.
Record-high interest rates are falling — a spur to indust
rial expansion, it is hoped The Bank of England's base
lending rate is down to 13.25 per cent after peaking at 15
per cent in October.
At the end of 1975, the cost of living in Britain was
escalating at 25 per cent a year. Just published figures for
1976 show it cut to 15.1 per cent a year. The Labor gov
ernment's voluntary pay code with the unions has limited
wage rises to less than the rate of inflation.
However. British inflation is still twice as high as that of
trade competitors. U.S. inflation is now less than five per
cent a year.
Energy department format debated
Washington — Congressional leaders are ready to work
with the Carter administration in forging a new Cabinet
level Department of Energy, but efforts are already bog
ging down in a welter of rival plans.
The concept of a new department to coordinate the
nation's energy policy, urged by both President Jimmy
Carter and former President Gerald Ford, has wide biparti
san backing in Congress. But the main problem is decid
ing which programs to include and which to leave out
when the new super-agency is formed.
At the heart of the controversy is whether to lodge
programs that push energy production under the same
roof with those that regulate energy in the public interest.
At the same time, administration officials are hoping to
introduce in Congress this week emergency legislation
authorizing the government to allocate natural gas
supplies among pipelines, a move that would permit
surplus gas to be shifted to states with acute shortages of
the fuel.
Action on energy reorganization is mandated by the act
Congress passed last year extending the Federal Energy
Administration through the end of 1977.
Today's weather
Fair and hazy through tomorrow with patchy night and
morning fog. Little temperature change. Lows in the 40s.
Highs in the mid 50s to mid 60s. Light winds.

the country has posted December figures showing a favor
able balance in trade with the rest of the world.
Record-high interest rates are falling — a spur to indust
rial expansion, it is hoped The Bank of England's base
lending rate is down to 13.25 per cent after peaking at 15
per cent in October.
At the end of 1975, the cost of living in Britain was
escalating at 25 per cent a year. Just published figures for
1976 show it cut to 15.1 per cent a year. The Labor gov
ernment's voluntary pay code with the unions has limited
wage rises to less than the rate of inflation.
However. British inflation is still twice as high as that of
trade competitors. U.S. inflation is now less than five per
cent a year.
Energy department format debated
Washington — Congressional leaders are ready to work
with the Carter administration in forging a new Cabinet
level Department of Energy, but efforts are already bog
ging down in a welter of rival plans.
The concept of a new department to coordinate the
nation's energy policy, urged by both President Jimmy
Carter and former President Gerald Ford, has wide biparti
san backing in Congress. But the main problem is decid
ing which programs to include and which to leave out
when the new super-agency is formed.
At the heart of the controversy is whether to lodge
programs that push energy production under the same
roof with those that regulate energy in the public interest.
At the same time, administration officials are hoping to
introduce in Congress this week emergency legislation
authorizing the government to allocate natural gas
supplies among pipelines, a move that would permit
surplus gas to be shifted to states with acute shortages of
the fuel.
Action on energy reorganization is mandated by the act
Congress passed last year extending the Federal Energy
Administration through the end of 1977.
Today's weather

Mondale begins European visit
Brussels, Belgium — Vice President Walter Mondale
arrived yesterday in Brussels on the first diplomatic mis
sion of the new Carter administration. He will visit Ameri
ca's major allies.
The vice president is on a 10-day global trip that will
take him to five European capitals and Tokyo for

ship in which ideas flow both ways across the Atlantic and
all are involved in leadership."
"President Carter supports the integration of Europe
and a productive dialogue between the United States and
the European Community Common Market — and with
our NATO partners as well as European friends not in the
community," he said.
The vice president's agenda in Brussels includes meet
ings today with Belgian Prime Minister Leo Tindemans
and officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Common Market.
British economy on upswing after loan
London — Three weeks after Britain obtained a $3.9
billion loan from the International Monetary Eund, the
economy is showing pronounced signs of recovery. But
critical obstacles remain.

The beleaguered pound sterling, the world's mightiest
currency in centuries past, has halted its slide on the
foreign exchanges and crept back slightly to more than
$1.71 after hitting an all-time low of $1.57 on Oct. 28.
After many months with a balance of payments deficit,
the country has posted December figures showing a favor
