Thermostats lowered
In accordance with President Jimmy Carter's call to turn
thermostats back to 65 degrees, the university will do the
best it can to meet this request, according to Dan DeYoung,
director of service operations here.
Lower temperatures will be in store for most university
buildings, except special care units in the hospital and in
laboratories in which temperature sensitive research is
being conducted, he said.
The thermostat rollback will be done by the university
and by computer where possible. However, much of the
effectiveness of the measure will depend on voluntary
cooperation, according to DeYoung.
At present, university thermostats are set at 68 degrees.
