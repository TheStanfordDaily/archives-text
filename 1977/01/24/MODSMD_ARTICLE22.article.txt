# 'Right-to-die' act criticized
## 
### Randy Block 
The "Natural Death Act" recently
passed by the California Assembly,
and now in effect, "makes it easier for a
few of us to die, but for the rest of us,
makes it much harder," according to
Jerome Lackner, director of the
California Department of Public
Health.
In the third meeting of the "Judaica
and Medical Ethics" series at the Med
ical Center last week, Lackner and
Karen Lebacqz, public health consul
tant in bioethics, discussed the draw
backs of the controversial "right-to-die
act," AB 3060.
"This bill has little to do with the
right to die," said Lebacqz. "It should
be called a right-to-give-written
directions bill."
The purpose of the new law is to
authorize physicians to withhold or
withdraw life-sustaining devices from
adults with terminal ailments who
have signed a directive.
According to Lebacqz, the directive
remains in effect five years and can be
revoked or suspended at any time by
the patient. She said that, in her opin
ion, AB 3060 is the best of all the bills
on the subject considered by the as
sembly.
Nevertheless, she said the bill does
not go far enough. The law "applies
only to terminal patients . . . and then
only once death is imminent," as to
whether or not life-support systems
are utilized, she said.
It would not apply in the Karen
Quinlan case and the like, where the
patient's life could be extended inde
finitely, she added.
Lackner said that the present law
would give persons the "right to die"
only in a very narrow range of situa
tions.
He said the bill applies only to
mechanical means and not to antibio
tics. "Much more than the respirator,"
he said, "antibiotics prolong the act of
dying."

"We should have a right to control
our own bodies. 1 think the right (to
determine one's own treatment)
should be as broad as possible,"
Lebacqz said. "A patient, for example,
should have the right to refuse in ad
vance a blood transfusion."
Lackner, who has studied both law
and medicine, said he believes that
physicians should be allowed to deal
with the death problem themselves
without regulatory legislation. Quot
ing the aphorism, "Hard cases make
bad law," Lackner said that in order to
satisfy all the possibilities, a death

with-dignity law would have to be
weakened to the point where it is inef
fective.
Asked about reform legislation,
Lackner replied that amendments to
the original act would be difficult to
pass through the assembly in original
form, and that amendments in the ver
sion which was passed have obscured
the original intent.
"It would be easier to change the
Ten Commandments than to change
legislation in this bill. . . . Some
people think this is the first step in the
direction of euthanasia, but it's not,"
Lackner said.
