# Not needed for improved economy
## Gandhi takeover denounced 
### 
News analysis
New Delhi (AP) — When Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi assumed
emergency powers on the morning of
June 25, 1975, opponents charged she
was laying the foundation for dictato
rial rule. But she called the measures
"shock therapy" to save India and its
610 million people.
Pointing mainly now to economic
improvements she says her therapy
worked and it is time to start dismantl
ing the emergency powers and hold
elections. The opponents contend the
improvements could have come with
out emergency powers under which
civil liberties were suspended and
political opponents went to jail. They
also maintain that Indian democracy
has been harmed.
Gandhi announced last week that
elections for a new Parliament would
be held in March "to reaffirm the
power of the people and to uphold the
fair name of India as a land committed
to the path of reconciliation, peace and
progress."
The strength of the nation cited by
Gandhi is derived primarily from the
economy, which was stagnant before
the emergency but which showed sig
nificant improvement in the past year
while more developed countries saw
their economic problems worsen.
To back up Gandhi's contention,
government officials cited a record
grain crop of 118 million tons last year,
a record buffer food stock of 18 million
tons, record foreign exchange reserves
of $3 billion, a 10 per cent jump in
industrial production, a 33 per cent
increase in exports and a money
saving 10 per cent drop in imports.
The government also boasts of hav
ing considerably reduced work stop
pages through a ban on strikes, and it
also claims to have virtually wiped out
blackmarketeering and smuggling
through the large-scale arrests of per
sons accused of economic crimes.
Oppressive measures unnecessary
Nevertheless, Gandhi's critics argue
that the improvement in the economy
could have been carried out even be
fore the emergency — without sus
pending civil liberties, jailing political
opponents and imposing news censor
ship — if she had exhibited stronger
leadership during her first nine years
in office.
Her opponents also say that the main
reason for the improvement in the
economy was the record grain harvest
which they contend was brought about
primarily by good rains, not any new
government policies.
But critics and supporters al ike give
Gandhi's government credit for using
the emergency to implement a family
planning program that has achieved
results for the first time since inde
pendence. In the past this had been
considered too politically risky in a
country where social customs have
stressed large families.
The main emphasis has been on

sterilization and the government an
nounced last week that 7.0 million
persons were sterilized in the first
seven months of the 1976-77 fiscal
year, against a target of 4.3 million for
the entire year.
But the government has been hurt by
scattered riots in areas where local au
thorities have been blamed for adopt
ing compulsory measures to achieve
large numbers of sterilizations.
To opposition leaders, many of
whom spent the emergency in jail, dis
cussions about improvement of the
economy are off the mark.

'But the greatest damage from the emergency is the
creation of an atmosphere of fear which pervades
everywhere, even in the ruling Congress party. . .

They say that the country should
judge Gandhi for what she has done to
alter the political system through vari
ous measures that will remain law
even after the emergency is lifted.
Rule by fear
"But the greatest damage from the
emergency is the creation of an atmos
phere of fear which pervades
everywhere, even in the ruling Con
gress party," says an 80-year-old
former prime minister, Morarji Desai, a

prominent opposition politician.
Desai said he thought that private
businessmen and industrialists, for
example, would be reluctant to contri
bute to the opposition campaign for
fear that they would be victimized
after the election if Gandhi's Congress
party is returned to leadership.
For Gandhi, the election campaign
could have some risks, although it has
the best organization and the opposi
tion has been unable to carry out nor
mal activities for the past 19 months,
some experts say.
The main risk is that her own party

has developed serious rivalries in the
past year, between its left and right
wings, and between the old guard gen
eration that helped fight for indepen
dence and the youth wing led by Gan
dhi's 30-year-old son, Sanjay.
Most experts say the differences are
likely to be resolved in the interest of
party unity, but they add that the st
rains could have long-term implica
tions.

News analysis
New Delhi (AP) — When Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi assumed
emergency powers on the morning of
June 25, 1975, opponents charged she
was laying the foundation for dictato
rial rule. But she called the measures
"shock therapy" to save India and its
610 million people.
Pointing mainly now to economic
improvements she says her therapy
worked and it is time to start dismantl
ing the emergency powers and hold
elections. The opponents contend the
improvements could have come with
out emergency powers under which
civil liberties were suspended and
political opponents went to jail. They
also maintain that Indian democracy
has been harmed.
Gandhi announced last week that
elections for a new Parliament would
be held in March "to reaffirm the
power of the people and to uphold the
fair name of India as a land committed
to the path of reconciliation, peace and
progress."
The strength of the nation cited by
Gandhi is derived primarily from the
economy, which was stagnant before
the emergency but which showed sig
nificant improvement in the past year
while more developed countries saw
their economic problems worsen.
To back up Gandhi's contention,
government officials cited a record
grain crop of 118 million tons last year,
a record buffer food stock of 18 million
tons, record foreign exchange reserves
of $3 billion, a 10 per cent jump in
industrial production, a 33 per cent
increase in exports and a money
saving 10 per cent drop in imports.
The government also boasts of hav
ing considerably reduced work stop
pages through a ban on strikes, and it
also claims to have virtually wiped out
blackmarketeering and smuggling
through the large-scale arrests of per
sons accused of economic crimes.
Oppressive measures unnecessary
Nevertheless, Gandhi's critics argue
that the improvement in the economy
could have been carried out even be
fore the emergency — without sus
pending civil liberties, jailing political
opponents and imposing news censor
ship — if she had exhibited stronger
leadership during her first nine years
in office.
Her opponents also say that the main
reason for the improvement in the
economy was the record grain harvest
which they contend was brought about
primarily by good rains, not any new
government policies.
But critics and supporters al ike give
Gandhi's government credit for using
the emergency to implement a family
planning program that has achieved
results for the first time since inde
pendence. In the past this had been
considered too politically risky in a
country where social customs have
stressed large families.
The main emphasis has been on

sterilization and the government an
nounced last week that 7.0 million
persons were sterilized in the first
seven months of the 1976-77 fiscal
year, against a target of 4.3 million for
the entire year.
But the government has been hurt by
scattered riots in areas where local au
thorities have been blamed for adopt
ing compulsory measures to achieve
large numbers of sterilizations.
To opposition leaders, many of
whom spent the emergency in jail, dis
cussions about improvement of the
economy are off the mark.

'But the greatest damage from the emergency is the
creation of an atmosphere of fear which pervades
everywhere, even in the ruling Congress party. . .

They say that the country should
judge Gandhi for what she has done to
alter the political system through vari
ous measures that will remain law
even after the emergency is lifted.
Rule by fear
"But the greatest damage from the
emergency is the creation of an atmos
phere of fear which pervades
everywhere, even in the ruling Con
gress party," says an 80-year-old
former prime minister, Morarji Desai, a

prominent opposition politician.
Desai said he thought that private
businessmen and industrialists, for
example, would be reluctant to contri
bute to the opposition campaign for
fear that they would be victimized
after the election if Gandhi's Congress
party is returned to leadership.
For Gandhi, the election campaign
could have some risks, although it has
the best organization and the opposi
tion has been unable to carry out nor
mal activities for the past 19 months,
some experts say.
The main risk is that her own party

has developed serious rivalries in the
past year, between its left and right
wings, and between the old guard gen
eration that helped fight for indepen
dence and the youth wing led by Gan
dhi's 30-year-old son, Sanjay.
