### 
Washington (AP) â€” President
Jimmy Carter's package of $23 billion
to $30 billion in tax cuts and other
economic stimulants, still undisclosed
in detail, is scheduled to go to Con
gress formally this week.
The House Budget Committee opens
hearings today on the economy with
Congressional Budget Director Alice
Rivlin as the first witness. The Carter
proposals are to be presented Thurs
day by Bert Lance, director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget in the
new administration, Chairman Robert
Giaimo (D-Conn.), said.
Meanwhile the Senate, which con
firmed most of Carter's Cabinet
nominees last week, scheduled votes
on remaining nominees, including
two who ran into signs of some opposi
tion.
Government job programs
Carter's economic program includes
a $7 billion to $11 billion one-time re
bate of income taxes; a permanent in
dividual income tax cut of about $4
billion, mostly for small and moderate
incomes; $2 billion in tax relief for bus
iness and a still unspecified invest
ment in government programs de
signed to produce jobs.
Specific details of the program have
been scarce, but the New York Times
reported yesterday that Carter's
economic advisers are considering a
rebate in the area of $10 billion to $11
billion.
The Times said the advisers have
also decided to send checks to the 16
million families or individuals who
don't earn enough to pay taxes.
Abortion snags nominee
Debate and vote on the nomination
of Joseph Califano Jr. to be secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare was set
for today. Califano faced critical ques
tions at the hearings on his nomination
about his opposition to use of federal
funds to pay for abortions.
Another vote was set for tomorrow
on Griffin Bell to be attorney general.
Some individuals and groups con
cerned with minority and civil rights
have opposed the nomination.
The Senate will probably vote dur
ing the week on the nominations of F.
Ray Marshall to be secretary of Labor
and Rep. Andrew Young (D-Ga.), to be
ambassador to the United Nations.
Assassination investigations
The House votes Wednesday on re
establishing its special committee to

conduct an investigation of the assas
sinations of President John Kennedy
and civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr. Action has been delayed twice
as members demanded more time to
look into proposals for financing the
investigation and the methods pro
posed to be used.
The House is expected to approve
re-establishment of the committee, but
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill has
said there is no chance it wil 1 authorize
any amount approaching the $6.5 mil
lion requested for the committee's first
year of operation.
House Democrats face a showdown
on whether Rep. Robert Sikes of
Florida will continue as chairman of
the appropriations subcommittee on
military construction.
The House reprimanded Sikes last
year for allegedly violating its stand
ards by investing in a bank whose
establishment was facilitated by his of
fice and failing to report certain finan
cial holdings.
Sikes is expected to be renominated
for the chairmanship today, but some
of his colleagues want to deny Sikes
the chairmanship.
