# Profs attack consulting proposal

Some professors have sharply at
tacked a new set of proposed rules
limiting the amount of time university
faculty may engage in professional
consulting.
Professors would be allowed to con
sult for only 13 days per quarter under
the proposal, made public last month.
Formerly, as of December 1975, faculty
members could consult for private and
government firms one day each five
day work week. Limits were not set for
weekend days.
The purpose of the new policy, ac
cording to the text of the draft, is "to
erase ambiguities in the requirements
of commitment on the part of univer
sity faculty."
But Vincent Roggeveen, transporta
tion professor, offered a different view
of the motive behind the policy.
Roggeveen said the policy is a
capitulation to government auditors
who visited campus last year to in
spect the records of faculty consulting
contracts. The auditors, he said, were
dismayed when they uncovered
numerous cases in which professors
were working on government
contracted research through their de
partments and also holding individual
contracts with the government.
Government interference
Roggeveen said he feels the gov
ernment pressured the university to
impose restrictions on consulting to
limit this duplication, and terms the
affair "a clear case of government in
terference."
He said he worries about the fact that
"the university is willing to change its
policy of faculty employment" to
satisfy government auditors. He
claimed this concession has been
criticized by engineering professors at
universities around the country.
Prof. Edward Feigenbaum, chair
man of the Computer Science Depart
ment, said the new policy is intended
to increase the productivity of the fa
culty. He said professors should be
evaluated on merit rather than on the
number of hours they work each week.
"There ought to be a rigorous way of
applying the merit criterion, such as
getting statements of satisfaction from
their boss," Feigenbaum said.
But professional isolation is an even
