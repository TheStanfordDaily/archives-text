# Profs attack consulting proposal
## 
### Lonnie Rosenwald Staff writer 
Some professors have sharply at
tacked a new set of proposed rules
limiting the amount of time university
faculty may engage in professional
consulting.
Professors would be allowed to con
sult for only 13 days per quarter under
the proposal, made public last month.
Formerly, as of December 1975, faculty
members could consult for private and
government firms one day each five
day work week. Limits were not set for
weekend days.
The purpose of the new policy, ac
cording to the text of the draft, is "to
erase ambiguities in the requirements
of commitment on the part of univer
sity faculty."
But Vincent Roggeveen, transporta
tion professor, offered a different view
of the motive behind the policy.
Roggeveen said the policy is a
capitulation to government auditors
who visited campus last year to in
spect the records of faculty consulting
contracts. The auditors, he said, were
dismayed when they uncovered
numerous cases in which professors
were working on government
contracted research through their de
partments and also holding individual
contracts with the government.
Government interference
Roggeveen said he feels the gov
ernment pressured the university to
impose restrictions on consulting to
limit this duplication, and terms the
affair "a clear case of government in
terference."
He said he worries about the fact that
"the university is willing to change its
policy of faculty employment" to
satisfy government auditors. He
claimed this concession has been
criticized by engineering professors at
universities around the country.
Prof. Edward Feigenbaum, chair
man of the Computer Science Depart
ment, said the new policy is intended
to increase the productivity of the fa
culty. He said professors should be
evaluated on merit rather than on the
number of hours they work each week.
"There ought to be a rigorous way of
applying the merit criterion, such as
getting statements of satisfaction from
their boss," Feigenbaum said.
But professional isolation is an even
greater concern among some faculty.
"Many of us in our professional
fields are nourished on the outside,"
said Roggeveen.
He said it is difficult for him to keep
abreast of current transportation de
velopments while confined to the uni
versity campus.
Universities use the tenure system to
protect the special freedom of their fa
culty, Roggeveen noted. He said they
should extend this protection to allow
professors to engage in any profes
sional activities.
He said this is an important advan
tage of the academic community in
luring engineers, scientists, lawyers
and business specialists away from
more lucrative industry and govern
ment jobs.
The policy was written by the Re
search Committee of the Academic
Council, at the urging last May of Vice
Provost for Research William Massy.
The committee held hearings two
weeks ago to hear faculty comments.
The draft report will be considered
by the university Faculty Senate on
Feb. 3, as a report item. This will give

faculty an opportunity to make their
views known, if they did not do so at
the earlier meeting.
The policy defines consulting as
"professional activity related to the
person's field or discipline, where
fee-for-service or equivalent relation
ship with a third party exists." Other
outside professional activities, like
publication and affiliation with gov
ernment, educational, and other non
profit agencies, are excluded from the
restrictions.
A further exemption for "moon
lighting" has become a focus of faculty
criticism of the policy. Moonlighting
is defined in the draft as "endeavors
for financial profit that are not directly
related to the person's field."
In effect this means that a manage
ment specialist could only consult in
his field one day per week, but could
sell used cars as often as he likes.
In the attempt to restrict the off
hours of faculty, Roggeveen feels the
university is impinging on the rights
of their employes. "I don't think it's
my employer's business," he said.
"Even if Monday through Friday be
long to Stanford, do Saturday and
Sunday?" Roggeveen asked.

hours of faculty, Roggeveen feels the
university is impinging on the rights
of their employes. "I don't think it's
my employer's business," he said.
"Even if Monday through Friday be
long to Stanford, do Saturday and
Sunday?" Roggeveen asked.
Some professors have sharply at
tacked a new set of proposed rules
limiting the amount of time university
faculty may engage in professional
consulting.
Professors would be allowed to con
sult for only 13 days per quarter under
the proposal, made public last month.
Formerly, as of December 1975, faculty
members could consult for private and
government firms one day each five
day work week. Limits were not set for
weekend days.
The purpose of the new policy, ac
cording to the text of the draft, is "to
erase ambiguities in the requirements
of commitment on the part of univer
sity faculty."
But Vincent Roggeveen, transporta
tion professor, offered a different view
of the motive behind the policy.
Roggeveen said the policy is a
capitulation to government auditors
who visited campus last year to in
spect the records of faculty consulting
contracts. The auditors, he said, were
dismayed when they uncovered
numerous cases in which professors
were working on government
contracted research through their de
partments and also holding individual
contracts with the government.
Government interference
Roggeveen said he feels the gov
ernment pressured the university to
impose restrictions on consulting to
limit this duplication, and terms the
affair "a clear case of government in
terference."
He said he worries about the fact that
"the university is willing to change its
policy of faculty employment" to
satisfy government auditors. He
claimed this concession has been
criticized by engineering professors at
universities around the country.
Prof. Edward Feigenbaum, chair
man of the Computer Science Depart
ment, said the new policy is intended
to increase the productivity of the fa
culty. He said professors should be
evaluated on merit rather than on the
number of hours they work each week.
"There ought to be a rigorous way of
applying the merit criterion, such as
getting statements of satisfaction from
their boss," Feigenbaum said.
But professional isolation is an even
greater concern among some faculty.
"Many of us in our professional
fields are nourished on the outside,"
said Roggeveen.
He said it is difficult for him to keep
abreast of current transportation de
velopments while confined to the uni
versity campus.
Universities use the tenure system to
protect the special freedom of their fa
culty, Roggeveen noted. He said they
should extend this protection to allow
professors to engage in any profes
sional activities.
He said this is an important advan
tage of the academic community in
luring engineers, scientists, lawyers
and business specialists away from
more lucrative industry and govern
ment jobs.
The policy was written by the Re
search Committee of the Academic
Council, at the urging last May of Vice
Provost for Research William Massy.
The committee held hearings two
weeks ago to hear faculty comments.
The draft report will be considered
by the university Faculty Senate on
Feb. 3, as a report item. This will give

faculty an opportunity to make their
views known, if they did not do so at
the earlier meeting.
The policy defines consulting as
"professional activity related to the
person's field or discipline, where
fee-for-service or equivalent relation
ship with a third party exists." Other
outside professional activities, like
publication and affiliation with gov
ernment, educational, and other non
profit agencies, are excluded from the
restrictions.
A further exemption for "moon
lighting" has become a focus of faculty
criticism of the policy. Moonlighting
is defined in the draft as "endeavors
for financial profit that are not directly
related to the person's field."
In effect this means that a manage
ment specialist could only consult in
his field one day per week, but could
sell used cars as often as he likes.
In the attempt to restrict the off
hours of faculty, Roggeveen feels the
university is impinging on the rights
of their employes. "I don't think it's
my employer's business," he said.
