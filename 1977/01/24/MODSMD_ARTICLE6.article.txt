# Controls on loans tightened
## 
### Beth Stern 
Stricter controls on granting loans have recently been
established here in order to decrease the number of default
and delinquency cases.
The new measures involve thoroughly checking into
the credit standing of the student applying for the loan,
said Joseph Jedd, manager of Student Accounting. Besides
considering the borrower's need, the Financial Aids Of
fice also considers the student's record of repayment of
past obligations.
For instance, Jedd said, a student "can't come back for
more" if he has not paid on previous "short-term" loans
(loans paid back while the student is still in school).
He added, however, that there is room for extenuating
circumstances, such as a death in the family, divorce of
parents or accidents.
The office is also considering any occasions of late
payment (past the deferment date) of tuition and room
and board, and also whether the student has a history of
writing bad checks.
If the Student Accounting Office discovers something
in the record which indicates the student is a bad credit
risk, the Financial Aids Officeis informed, Jedd said. Both
offices then decide if the student will get the loan.
Since September 1976 pending bankruptcies have been
twice the amount of the previous year. The increase has
prompted the governm »nt to put more pressure on schools
to explain delinquencies, said Jedd.
"Years ago. we would just take the word of the student
that he couldn't pay. We would give him an extension on
his payments. Now we have to require proof of hardship.
Failure to do that could be a cause for denial of further
government support."
Proof of hardship, said Jedd, is obtained by examining
income tax reports and records of unemployment or wel
fare.
"If the student proves hardship," said Jedd. "th»«re is no
problem. Delinquency doesn't only mean non-payment It

means there is no valid reason for non-payment."
Besides tightening procedures to obtain loans, the uni
versity is presently looking into a program which has been
adopted at Harvard called the Parental Loan Program
(PLP). PLP will enable parents to pay for a student's educa
tion in monthly installments over a six-year period.
The plan would be available to a group of "middle
class" parents — those who are not eligible for govern
ment loans but are unable to finance their child's entire
education on a cash basis.
Another change in the loan process may be the estab
lishment of a maximum loan amount proportional to the
anticipated earning of the student upon graduation.
"It is important for us to know what role the student
loan assumes in the overall funding of his or her program.
The level of indebtedness can reach startling proportions,
particularly when compared with starting salaries in a
given field," said Ken Kaufman, assistant director of Fi
nancial Aids.
Compared to the group of 40 private universities which
make up the Consortium of Financing of Higher Educa
tion. the university has an average percentage of delin
quencies. The schools which had a lower percentage of
delinquencies generally had a tougher loan policy.
For example, at Northwestern University, if a student
commits himself to summer earnings and then is unable to
get a job. he cannot (as has been the case here) obtain a loan
to make up the difference.
Because of the tighter controls Jedd anticipates fewer
loans will be granted. This policy is designed to help
prevent cases such as the medical student here who,
owing the university almost $20,000, declared ban
kruptcy just four months after he graduated.
"The sad thing about this," commented Jedd. "is that
his capacity for earning will be vory gmat very soon This
could mean $20,000 lo>-t to future borrowers who really
need the money."

loans will be granted. This policy is designed to help
prevent cases such as the medical student here who,
owing the university almost $20,000, declared ban
kruptcy just four months after he graduated.
"The sad thing about this," commented Jedd. "is that
his capacity for earning will be vory gmat very soon This
could mean $20,000 lo>-t to future borrowers who really
need the money."
Stricter controls on granting loans have recently been
established here in order to decrease the number of default
and delinquency cases.
The new measures involve thoroughly checking into
the credit standing of the student applying for the loan,
said Joseph Jedd, manager of Student Accounting. Besides
considering the borrower's need, the Financial Aids Of
fice also considers the student's record of repayment of
past obligations.
For instance, Jedd said, a student "can't come back for
more" if he has not paid on previous "short-term" loans
(loans paid back while the student is still in school).
He added, however, that there is room for extenuating
circumstances, such as a death in the family, divorce of
parents or accidents.
The office is also considering any occasions of late
payment (past the deferment date) of tuition and room
and board, and also whether the student has a history of
writing bad checks.
If the Student Accounting Office discovers something
in the record which indicates the student is a bad credit
risk, the Financial Aids Officeis informed, Jedd said. Both
offices then decide if the student will get the loan.
Since September 1976 pending bankruptcies have been
twice the amount of the previous year. The increase has
prompted the governm »nt to put more pressure on schools
to explain delinquencies, said Jedd.
"Years ago. we would just take the word of the student
that he couldn't pay. We would give him an extension on
his payments. Now we have to require proof of hardship.
Failure to do that could be a cause for denial of further
government support."
Proof of hardship, said Jedd, is obtained by examining
income tax reports and records of unemployment or wel
fare.
"If the student proves hardship," said Jedd. "th»«re is no
problem. Delinquency doesn't only mean non-payment It

means there is no valid reason for non-payment."
Besides tightening procedures to obtain loans, the uni
versity is presently looking into a program which has been
adopted at Harvard called the Parental Loan Program
(PLP). PLP will enable parents to pay for a student's educa
tion in monthly installments over a six-year period.
The plan would be available to a group of "middle
class" parents — those who are not eligible for govern
ment loans but are unable to finance their child's entire
education on a cash basis.
Another change in the loan process may be the estab
lishment of a maximum loan amount proportional to the
anticipated earning of the student upon graduation.
"It is important for us to know what role the student
loan assumes in the overall funding of his or her program.
The level of indebtedness can reach startling proportions,
particularly when compared with starting salaries in a
given field," said Ken Kaufman, assistant director of Fi
nancial Aids.
Compared to the group of 40 private universities which
make up the Consortium of Financing of Higher Educa
tion. the university has an average percentage of delin
quencies. The schools which had a lower percentage of
delinquencies generally had a tougher loan policy.
For example, at Northwestern University, if a student
commits himself to summer earnings and then is unable to
get a job. he cannot (as has been the case here) obtain a loan
to make up the difference.
Because of the tighter controls Jedd anticipates fewer
loans will be granted. This policy is designed to help
prevent cases such as the medical student here who,
owing the university almost $20,000, declared ban
kruptcy just four months after he graduated.
