# U.S. military aid and human rights

Should the United States govern
ment cut off military aid to regimes in
six countries—Argentina, Haiti, In
donesia, Iran, Peru and the Philippines
— which are suspected of severe in
fringements of their citizens'
internationally-recognized human
rights?
This question will confront Con
gress in early March when it com
mences hearings on the Human Rights
Amendment to the 1977 Foreign As
sistance Act. This amendment stipu
lates that military aid must be cur
tailed to any government found to be a
gross and consistent violator of human
rights.
All Congress must do, it would
seem, is determine whether any or all
of these regimes are in fact guilty of
repressive practices such as systematic
torture and prolonged detention with
out trial of political prisoners. If so,
Congress is in effect legally bound to
end military aid.
On closer examination, however,
the issues and problems confronting
the Congress are far less straightfor
ward. First, there is the fact that the
regimes which were targeted for inves
tigation, recognizing the imminent
danger of losing U.S. arms — their
"lifeblood" — have made certain
cosmetic reforms to give themselves a
benevolent face.
Release
The Marcos regime in the Philip
pines, for instance, released roughly
1500 political prisoners for the
Christmas holidays. (An estimated 15-
20,000 Filipino political prisoners are
still being detained.)
The Suharto regime has recently an
nounced the release of several Indone
sian political prisoners, neglecting to
mention that they had been "released"
to Buru Island, which has come to be a
symbol of the "Asian Gulag" which is
Indonesia. Such public relations man
euvers may provide those con
gressmen who would rather continue
aid with the justification for doing so.
Furthermore, Congress must come
to terms with the State Department,
whose position has been that military
aid should be continued, even though
ample evidence exists documenting
cruel and inhuman treatment of politi
cal prisoners and other human rights
violations on the part of these regimes.

The curious logic of the State De
partment in this regard is revealed in
its report on the Philippines, where it
argues: "Elimination of the U.S. sec
urity assistance program could lessen
the ability of the United States to influ
ence the Philippine Government on a
range of U.S. interests in the Philip
pines, including the promotion of
human rights. . .
That human rights should be
lumped together in the State Depart
ment's thinking with other U.S. in
terests and be given no particular
priority is hardly surprising. What is
inexcusable is the department's at
tempt to ignore the reality that U.S.
military aid is part and parcel of the
repressive policies of these client re
gimes. Without such aid, they would
lack the material and technical
wherewithal to implement their anti
popular schemes.
Even when we adhere to a strict in
terpretation of human rights violations
— viz., as instances of torture and
other forms of cruel treatment of polit
ical prisoners — the evidence im
plicating the U.S. government in such
practices on the part of these regimes is
sobering. The training of certain select
military police personnel from these
countries includes a course in torture
techniques taught in Texas.
Overwhelming
When we define human rights viola
tions more broadly — as indeed we
should — to include systematic sup
pression of popular discontent
through the use of force, evidence of
U.S. complicity in such suppression is
overwhelming.
Military and police officers from
these countries receive training in riot
control and counterinsurgency
techniques in the U.S.-controlled
Panama Canal Zone.
The U.S. government has provided
the Marcos regime with such coun
terinsurgency weapons as Huey attack
helicopters, Cl3O transport planes
(convertible into gunships) and
napalm, all formerly used against the
Vietnamese. Furthermore, the major
U.S. air force base in the Philippines,
Clark Field, has been used by Philip
pine F5 fighters as a base from which
to launch counterinsurgency raids.
Moreover, now Marcos is demand
ing $1 billion in military aid (over a
five-year period) as rental payment for

continued U.S. use of its Philippine
bases. Continued presence of these
bases, then, means continued military
aid for Marcos.
Training
Finally, the Philippine police forces
receive training and substantial mate
rial support from the U.S. government
under the guise of "narcotics control."
A concrete example of the way in
which U.S.-provided training in nar
cotics control can be translated into
control of dissent occurred in April
1973, when the anti-narcotics unit of
the Philippine constabulary raided the
home of Liliosa Hilao, a suspected op
ponent of the government, and tor
tured her to death.
The link between U.S. military aid
and the repressive policies of regimes
like that of Marcos is evident. Yet the
forces pressing for the continuation of
aid to these regimes are powerful.
Within the government the State De
partment and the Pentagon are the
most vocal defenders of this view.
Moreover, if the case of South Korean
influence-peddling is symptomatic of
a more pervasive phenomenon, the
proponents of continued aid within
Congress itself may prove to be a sig
nificant force.
In spite of this, mass pressure on
Congress (through letter-writing for
instance) to cut off aid can have an
impact. The case of Chile serves as a
precedent. The Pinochet regime is no
longer receiving overt U.S. military as
sistance because enough Americans
demanded an end to U.S. support for
this dictator. It can happen again.
