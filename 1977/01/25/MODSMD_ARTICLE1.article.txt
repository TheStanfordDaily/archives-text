# Pre-meds air gripes about chem series
## 
### J.P. Monen 
A re-examination of the organic
chemistry series is being called for in a
petition which began circulating
through chemistry and biology classes
last week.
The petition, drawn up by sopho
more pre-med Dave McFarland and
other Phi Sigma House chemistry stu
dents, states that "constructive
changes need to be made'in the organic
chemistry series."
"We are not a group of radical pre
meds trying to overthrow the chemis
try department," stressed McFarland.
"We feel we have some legitimate
gripes that should at least be given
consideration."
McFarland singled out the labs as
the weakest link in the organic chain.
"The Chem 130 lab is under a very
tight time schedule; if something goes
wrong, you are out of luck," he said.
Translating textbooks
"The lab final had little to do with
the lab itself. The mean on the final
was about 150 out of 400. One of the
textbooks used in the lab was written
entirely in German. 1 spent hours in the
chemistry library translating the text
and running all over digging out refer
ence materials. An entirely dispropor
tionate amount of time was demanded
for three units," McFarland added.
Tom Wolff, a teaching assistant for
Chem 130 defends the use of Beilstein,
the German text.
"As long as the course is taught
there is no substitute for it," Wolff
said. However, Wolff conceded that
the Chemistry Department needs to
give "more overall thought" to the or
ganic series.
He said he does not see much good
resulting from a petition. "It is hard to
alter a system which has operated so
long," said Wolff. "It is very difficult to
initiate change."
McFarland disagreed.
"The physics and biology depart
ments used to be as bad as chemistry,
Wit they were improved. The bio labs
are pass/fail, very low-keyed and very
good as a result."
The Chem 36 lab will become pass I
fail this spring.
Organic: tough stuff
The organic chemistry series begins
after one quarter of general chemistry
compared to one year of general at
most universities.
"More preparation is needed before
students get thrown into organic,"
contended McFarland.
The organic series consists of a four
unit class winter quarter and a three
unit class and three unit lab in both
spring and autumn quarters.
McFarland said he feels that the 250
signatures which have been collected
should be enough to convince the om
budsman that "there are enough dis
gruntled students to warrant a formal
complaint to the Chemistry Depart
ment."
McFarland said he will collect more
signatures and go to the Chemistry
Department himself, if necessary, but
he thinks that the department is "wil
ling" to listen to the students. "We're
going to go through the proper chan
nels with this thing," he said.
Ombudsman John Goheen said he is
"undecided at the moment as to the
best course of action" and declined to
comment on the petition.
James LuValle, director of the or
ganic chemistry program, was ill and
unavailable for comment.

chemistry library translating the text
and running all over digging out refer
ence materials. An entirely dispropor
tionate amount of time was demanded
for three units," McFarland added.
Tom Wolff, a teaching assistant for
Chem 130 defends the use of Beilstein,
the German text.
"As long as the course is taught
there is no substitute for it," Wolff
said. However, Wolff conceded that
the Chemistry Department needs to
give "more overall thought" to the or
ganic series.
He said he does not see much good
resulting from a petition. "It is hard to
alter a system which has operated so
long," said Wolff. "It is very difficult to
initiate change."
McFarland disagreed.
"The physics and biology depart
ments used to be as bad as chemistry,
Wit they were improved. The bio labs
are pass/fail, very low-keyed and very
good as a result."
The Chem 36 lab will become pass I
fail this spring.
Organic: tough stuff
The organic chemistry series begins
after one quarter of general chemistry
compared to one year of general at
most universities.
"More preparation is needed before
students get thrown into organic,"
contended McFarland.
The organic series consists of a four
unit class winter quarter and a three
unit class and three unit lab in both
spring and autumn quarters.
McFarland said he feels that the 250
signatures which have been collected
should be enough to convince the om
budsman that "there are enough dis
gruntled students to warrant a formal
complaint to the Chemistry Depart
ment."
McFarland said he will collect more
signatures and go to the Chemistry
Department himself, if necessary, but
he thinks that the department is "wil
ling" to listen to the students. "We're
going to go through the proper chan
nels with this thing," he said.
Ombudsman John Goheen said he is
"undecided at the moment as to the
best course of action" and declined to
comment on the petition.
James LuValle, director of the or
ganic chemistry program, was ill and
unavailable for comment.
A re-examination of the organic
chemistry series is being called for in a
petition which began circulating
through chemistry and biology classes
last week.
The petition, drawn up by sopho
more pre-med Dave McFarland and
other Phi Sigma House chemistry stu
dents, states that "constructive
changes need to be made'in the organic
chemistry series."
"We are not a group of radical pre
meds trying to overthrow the chemis
try department," stressed McFarland.
"We feel we have some legitimate
gripes that should at least be given
consideration."
McFarland singled out the labs as
the weakest link in the organic chain.
"The Chem 130 lab is under a very
tight time schedule; if something goes
wrong, you are out of luck," he said.
Translating textbooks
"The lab final had little to do with
the lab itself. The mean on the final
was about 150 out of 400. One of the
textbooks used in the lab was written
entirely in German. 1 spent hours in the
chemistry library translating the text
and running all over digging out refer
ence materials. An entirely dispropor
tionate amount of time was demanded
for three units," McFarland added.
