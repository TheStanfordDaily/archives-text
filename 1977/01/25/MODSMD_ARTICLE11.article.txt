# Jerry Brown remains an enigma
## 
### 
There are many misunderstandings and mixed
impressions regarding Governor Edmund "Jerry"
Brown Jr., perhaps rightly so. The young governor
of California has become an enigma. He cannot be
labeled by traditional political standards — liberal
or conservative — and, indeed, often appears to be a
mixture of many elements.
Brown has been described with rarely used
generalities ranging from a "spiritual intellect" and
"Buddhist philosopher" to a "practical idealist."
Only one point remains clear — Brown is unique.
As a result of Brown's unorthodox approach, he
has achieved a politically mystical aura, making it
difficult to distinguish appearance from reality and
the image from the man.
Just what is the basis for the myth surrounding
Jerry Bfown? Born into political life, living in the
shadow of his father, Pat Brown, two-timegovernor
of California, Jerry often found grounds for disag
reement with his "liberal, big government" father
and developed both liberal and conservative
characteristics.
Yale Law School
In 1956 he entered a Jesuit seminary but after
three-and-a-half years decided to leave and study
law. With his graduation from Yale Law School, his
liberal activist record in civil rights and anti-
Vietnam movements, and his father's name, he en
tered upon a political career.
In five years Brown managed to advance from the
Los Angeles Community College Board in 1969 to
secretary of state in 1970 and finally, after develop
ing the nation's toughest, most efficient campaign
laws, to governor of California in 1974.
Once he took office, the anomaly of Jerry Brown
became easily apparent. After his seven minute in
augural address, Californians realized this was no
ordinary governor. He quickly set in with 14 or 16
hour work days, demanding the same dedication
from his appointees, who consist of a remarkably
high proportion of well educated 1960s reformers,
minorities and women.
Too much work
He found no time for public appearances and
gubernatorial acts of pageantry, arguing that there
was too much work to be done. Stressing that the
times demanded sacrifice, he did away with the
governor's limousine, started driving in a motor
pool Plymouth, and refused to live in the Reagan
built governor's mansion, choosing instead to live
in a small apartment across the street from the capi
tol.
All these actions and the results of his monk-like
labor started the political press wheels rolling.

Brown was a new sensation, a young, dynamic
leader representing the new wave in politics. Just
how much substance lies behind these claims can
be seen by Brown's record.
On the negative side, his former advisers and
critics point out that Brown tends to be eccentric at
times, delegates authority poorly and is dictatorial
once he has decided on a course of action. He has
been known to take serious problems too lightly, to

annoy aides with his aloof manner, and to cut back
programs without enough thought to new ones. All
the while he acts as a monetary skinflint. Further
more, with his bid for the presidency, he has been
called an ambitious political opportunist.
On the other side, almost all observers readily
admit he has achieved major political feats. A re
cent survey among California voters gave Brown an
unprecedented 85 per cent approval rating as gov
ernor.
National appeal
Presidential primaries revealed not only his am
bition and determination but also his national ap
peal. In every primary he entered, Brown either
soundly defeated Carter or did much better than
expected.
Indicative of the political power Brown has
gathered was Carter's gesture to the California de
legation thanking them for not "unleashing"
Brown earlier.
Jerry Brown has aggregated several clever politi
cal accomplishments. He has uncannily been able
to mix elements of conservative fiscal policy and
liberal progressive thought. In this way he gained
support from both Republicans and Democrats. As
Brown said, "We're going to move left and right at
the same time."
Most politicians would find themselves on shaky
ground making a statement like that, but Brown's
ability to project confidence and authroity in what
he says and to back it up with an almost impeccable
record protects him.
When asked in Newsweek about his record as

governor, Brown openly replied, "1 have the best
record of achievement in the country."
The accomplishments of the Brown administra
tion over the past two years can be summarized by
its legislative record: a compromise on the Califor
nia coastal problem, closing of business tax
loopholes, income tax assistance for the working
poor, three bills for nuclear safety, redrafting of the
criminal sentencing system including heavier sen
tences for heroin pushers and armed criminals, re
ducing penalties for minor marijuana use, creation
of a new $1 billion housing program, and formation
of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board.
In front of this record has been the "new spirit"
and political dynamics of Jerry Brown. He speaks
mystically about his vision of "planetary realism"
and"the age of limits."
Brown is always ready to point out problems in
the state, nation and world, but unlike his fellow
politicians, he doesn't claim to have all the
answers.
Ironically, as a Democratic governor from the
largest state in the union, Brown argues we must
limit the size of our government.
Pressing problems
The past record and political rhetoric of Jerry
Brown must be given a favorable appraisal but there
are several pressing problems in California today,
and Brown's ability to face these challenges will
perhaps be the best test of his quality as a governor
and his future promise.
The statewide unemployment rate is near 10 per
cent. In addition Brown faces problems with in
creased property tax burdens on low and middle
income home owners, a faltering program on
urban renewal and pollution control, and needed
reform in the State Health Department.
He is currently working on a $1.2 billion Serrano
school reform plan, and just released the new state
budget which indicates reform will have to be ac
complished without increased taxes.
Brown will most likely continue to approach
problems with his unorthodox methods. For exam
ple, last week he spent an entire evening in San
Francisco slums talking to tenants about their
needs and complaints.
Yes, problems do exist. Then what can be antici
pated in the future? Perhaps there are only two
things we can be certain to find in upcoming
California politics — to expect the unexpected, and
to remember there will be anything but "govern
ment as usual" under Jerry Brown.
