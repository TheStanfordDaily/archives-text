# Are Israelis blocking peace?

The Israeli government's blunt an
nouncement last week that it will not
negotiate with the PLO "anywhere or
in any form" and will "oppose vigor
ously" a Palestinian state on the West
Bank, was discouraging and disquiet
ing.
In recent months, prospects for
peace in the Middle East have never
seemed more favorable. The govern
ments of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and
Saudi Arabia are now publicly com
mitted to a settlement with Israel based
on secure and recognized borders.
But they also insist on the right of
Palestinians to a state of their own, and
it is clear peace will not come until that
issue is resolved.
Israel claims the PLO is bent on its
destruction. But there are unmistaka
ble signs that the PLO is prepared to
abandon that policy. Last fall two PLO
representatives told a group of Ameri
can Jewish leaders that the PLO will
accept the existence of "two sovereign
states ... a Palestinian state and a
Jewish state."
Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the

PLO's political department, has
pledged that when the Palestinians
have a state of their own "we stop
armed struggle."
And a year ago the London represen
tative of the PLO, Said Hammami,
proposed that a Palestinian state be es
tablished side by side with Israel, with
the people of both states "recognizing
each other and the other's right to live
in peace."
Hammami added, "I don't want the
future Palestinian state to be a base for
violence. . . . We propose a Palestinian
state for the sake of peace."
Fortunately the Israeli government
does not speak for all its citizens. A
number of leading Israelis, including
public officials and members of parli
ament. are calling for direct talks with
the Palestinians and the encourage
ment of moderate forces within the
PLO.
Four Israelis, led by Major Gen. Mati
Peled, met recently with PLO rep
resentatives in Paris and reported that
even "a little encouragement" by Is-

rael could bring about an official re
nunciation of the PLO's covenant
against Israel.
Abba Eban, an elder statesman who
is challenging Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin for leadership of the Labor party,
urges that Israel "have dialogue with
any Palestinian representation that ac
cepts Israel's status."
And the credo of the Israeli Council
for Israel-Palestinian Peace states that
"the only road to peace is through the
coexistence of two sovereign states,
each of which will be the national
home of its people â€” the state of Israel
and the state of Palestine."
There are forces working for concili
ation on both sides of this tragic dis
pute. Now that sentiment among the
Arabs favors a peaceful settlement it
would be sad beyond measure if in
transigence on the part of the Israeli
government were to stand in the way
of the peace which has for so long
eluded the people of the Middle East.
