In the movie "Two Minute Warning" the teams
on the field at the Coliseum are clearly USC and
Stanford. The world-famous LSJL'MB even ap
pears twice in brief scenes. Which Stanford-SC
game are the film clips taken from? -D.F.
The film clips are from that memorable game in
October of '75 when the Stanford team kicked a
last, split-second field goal and beat USC by 13 to
10.
Nancy Peterson, Athletic Information Director,
tells me the movie isn't too hot, since "they try to
throw everything in" — from brutality to ro
mance. But, she says, there are some great shots of
—ours truly—Larry Reynolds, Ron Inge, and
Savann Thompson. And Peterson says, the movie
copies the Stanford "look" in detail, including the
"clashing" maroon pants and red jackets worn by
the coaches.
As for the shots of the crowd, Peterson specu
lates they were taken during another game.
In the movie, the grandstands are packed. But
for the real game, the L.A. Coliseum, with a
capacity of 92,000, held only about 68,000 fans.

I have heard that the chocolate shakes at
McDonald's not only do not contain milk but ac-

tually consist primarily of petroleum by
products. What exactly are the ingredients of
McDonald's chocolate shakes? -R.G.
Well, I've heard of hair in a milk shake, or an
occasional fly in a shake, or even a stray chunk of
fingernail in a milk shake . . . but petroleum by
products??? Sorry, but I couldn't find anything to
support that one.
I talked to the manager of the Menlo Park
McDonald's, Ken Eschman, who listed all the in
gredients. Chocolate shakes, he says, are made
with chocolate syrup and an ice milk mix.
That mix (processed by Carnation Co.) contains
REAL milk, sugar, corn syrup solids, cream, cel
lulose, salt, vanilla, and a stabilizer called
"hexameta phosphate." In case you're wonder
ing, a "stabilizer" keeps the thickness of the shake
consistent.
Since I know almost nothing about chemistry,
hexameta phosphate sounded suspicious to me,
and I called Dr. James Lu Valle in the Chemistry
Dept. Although he wasn't too specific about the
origin of the substance, he did say it has "nothing
to do with petroleum by-products."
So, the way it looks is that about the only things
you have to worry about when you're guzzling
that chocolate shake are calories and zits!

for the real game, the L.A. Coliseum, with a
capacity of 92,000, held only about 68,000 fans.

I have heard that the chocolate shakes at
McDonald's not only do not contain milk but ac-

tually consist primarily of petroleum by
products. What exactly are the ingredients of
McDonald's chocolate shakes? -R.G.
Well, I've heard of hair in a milk shake, or an
occasional fly in a shake, or even a stray chunk of
fingernail in a milk shake . . . but petroleum by
products??? Sorry, but I couldn't find anything to
support that one.
I talked to the manager of the Menlo Park
McDonald's, Ken Eschman, who listed all the in
gredients. Chocolate shakes, he says, are made
with chocolate syrup and an ice milk mix.
That mix (processed by Carnation Co.) contains
REAL milk, sugar, corn syrup solids, cream, cel
lulose, salt, vanilla, and a stabilizer called
"hexameta phosphate." In case you're wonder
ing, a "stabilizer" keeps the thickness of the shake
consistent.
Since I know almost nothing about chemistry,
hexameta phosphate sounded suspicious to me,
and I called Dr. James Lu Valle in the Chemistry
Dept. Although he wasn't too specific about the
origin of the substance, he did say it has "nothing
to do with petroleum by-products."
So, the way it looks is that about the only things
you have to worry about when you're guzzling
that chocolate shake are calories and zits!

In the movie "Two Minute Warning" the teams
on the field at the Coliseum are clearly USC and
Stanford. The world-famous LSJL'MB even ap
pears twice in brief scenes. Which Stanford-SC
game are the film clips taken from? -D.F.
The film clips are from that memorable game in
October of '75 when the Stanford team kicked a
last, split-second field goal and beat USC by 13 to
10.
Nancy Peterson, Athletic Information Director,
tells me the movie isn't too hot, since "they try to
throw everything in" — from brutality to ro
mance. But, she says, there are some great shots of
—ours truly—Larry Reynolds, Ron Inge, and
Savann Thompson. And Peterson says, the movie
copies the Stanford "look" in detail, including the
"clashing" maroon pants and red jackets worn by
the coaches.
As for the shots of the crowd, Peterson specu
lates they were taken during another game.
In the movie, the grandstands are packed. But
for the real game, the L.A. Coliseum, with a
capacity of 92,000, held only about 68,000 fans.
