## Problems with science news 
### Malinda Elliott 
The year was 1973. Inside a
laboratory at Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), in a double
walled room, behind steel-lined
doors, a bushy-haired, 27-year
old Israeli named Uri Geller sat
drawing pictures in a childlike
scrawl.
Outside the room, physicists
Russell Targ and Harold Putoff
waited with the rest of their re
search team for Geller's sketches
of seemingly inconsequential
objects — a firecracker, a bunch
of grapes, a dove in flight.
Later, during the same exper
iment, an ex-police commis
sioner from Burbank, California,
Pat Price, sat in the same room
and drew more pictures — of
familiar Bay Area spots such as
the Allied Arts shopping plaza
in Menlo Park.
ESP
Both Geller and Price were at
tempting to visualize some
"target" set for them secretly by
the SRI experimenters. To draw
their pictures of objects without
prior knowledge of what they
would mentally "see," the two
men were using what Puthoff
and Targ call "a biological in
formation channel whose
characteristics appear to fall out
side the range of known percep
tual modalities" — the layman
would call it "extrasensory per
ception," better known as ESP.
Both Geller and Price were re
latively successful at visualizing
and drawing things they had not
previously seen or heard of.
According to the formal scien
tific convention, Puthoff and
Targ published the official re
port of their work in a respected
journal, Nature, in October,
1974. The report was remarkable
only in that it gave more official
credence to a field historically
reserved for "kooks."
Yet in spite of the conservative
method of announcement, the
study sparked controversial
press reports. The publicity has
overshadowed the project's
modest budget and the small
scale of the experiments.
Critical
Some of the press converage
has been sharply critical. Time,
Scientific American, and the
Humanist have all questioned
Geller's credibility and the ex
perimenters' methods.
According to Ron Deutsch, di
rector of public relations for

SRI, "This quarter-million
dollar study has brought us more
publicity than the rest of our
million-dollar research put to
gether."
SRl's headaches over the pub
licity generated by Puthoff and
Targ's experiments point up the
dominant problems facing sci
ence news bureaus today.
The press, it seems, is faced
with a hard task in choosing re
levant science stories and play
ing them accurately. There is
always the temptation to sen
sationalize.
Walter Sullivan, science wri
ter for the New York Times, once
estimated that a tidal wave of be
tween 1000 and 1500 science
news press releases washed over
his desk every day.
The question clearly is: Which
releases are newsworthy? An
overburdened science writer or
editor often goes for one with
"color."
Accuracy needed
Like SRI, the Stanford Medical
Center News Service is respon
sible for getting news to science
writers, and trying to get accu
rate play for its releases. Spyros
Andreopoulos, director of the
service, remembers well the day
when the first heart transplant in
the United States was performed
by Norman Shumway at the
Stanford Hospital.
"There were 150 newsmen in
the basement as soon as the news
was out," he recalls. And they
stayed there until the patient,
Mike Kasperak, died two weeks
later.
"When three major networks
have that much commitment,
you have to give them something
to do every day. . . . We had to
dream up all sorts of features for
them to do," says Andreopoulos.
Fortunate rarity
Fortunately for the lpngevity
of directors of scientific news
bureaus, highly colorful events,
such as ESP breakthroughs and
heart transplants, are rare.
Still, the difficulty of report
ing events accurately from the
scientists' viewpoint, and in
terestingly for the public, re
mains a problem. Newsmen will
try to add color to highlight
otherwise dry copy. Scientists
will remain touchy about accu
racy. The news bureau is in bet
ween.
Andreopoulos sees two trends
that he thinks may be improving

the communication of science
news in the press. First, he
points to a growing tendency to
print the opinions of scientific
experts.
"I think you'll be seeing more
of that kind of science/opinion
news," says Andreopoulos.
In-depth reporting
A second direction in science
news, according to An
dreopoulos, is the in-depth re
porting of trends — in such
fields as genetic engineering and
organ transplants —rather than
concentration on news-as-an
event. This development means
the press is focusing on the im
plications of scientific dis
coveries.
These science reporting
trends are indications of the pub
lic's interest, its demand to know
more about the direction and re
levancy of science.
According to Herbert Holley,
Technology Utilization Officer
at Ames Air Force Base, who
publicizes the results of the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space
Administration research: "There
is no lack of interest on either
side. Both the scientist and the
public are interested in com
munication."
Unpredictable
Still, although directors of
news services may analyze
trends, no one is really quite sure
what makes a science news story
newsworthy to the science wri
ter or the public. "It's totally un
predictable," says Bob Beyers,
director of the Stanford Univer
sity News Service.
What is heartening is the gen
eral willingness of both press
and scientists, with the news
bureaus acting as inter
mediaries, to keep working at
communication. Hall Puthoff,
who probably has had as strong a
dose of press publicity as any
scientists, gives the press a high
rating for accuracy and fairness.
"On the whole, 90 percent of
what the press printed was fair
and accurate," he says.
