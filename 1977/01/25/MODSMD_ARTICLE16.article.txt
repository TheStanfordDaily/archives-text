# One of first woman priests
## Wendy Smith to be ordained here 
### Jordan Lorence 
The Episcopal Church has
never had women priests. That
is, until this year. Last Sep
tember, the General Convention
of the Episcopal Church broke
with 2000 years of tradition and
approved the ordination of
women starting Jan. 1, 1977.
Asst. Dean of the Chapel Wendy
Smith will become one of the
first women priests when she is
ordained in Memorial Church on
Feb. 9.
Smith became interested in
the ministry when she took clas
ses from Stanford's Dean of the
Chapel, Robert Hamerton-kelly,
at Scripps College in Claremont.
"After I graduated in 1968, I
went to Harvard Divinity
School," Smith said. "I wanted
to serve in the Christian minis
try. I thought I would have to go
into education, which was one of
the few church vocations open to
women. I thought it would take
20 or 30 years before the Church
would change its mind."
She graduated from Harvard
with a master's in theology in
1970. She then became very in
volved with the Episcopal
Church when they opened the
diaconate to women a few
months after he graduation.
"I started with youth work and
then moved to the diaconate.
This was an important step," she
said, "because every priest must
first be a deacon."
Differences
There are some differences be
tween the two positions," Smith
said. "Both are ordained posi
tions. Deacons can baptize,
marry and bury, but only a priest
can celebrate the Eucharist or
grant absolution.

"I thought I would have to go into education, which
was one of the few church vocations open to women.
I thought it would take 20 or 30 years before the
Church would change its mind."

Entering the Episcopal priest
hood is more rigorous than any
other denomination, according
to Smith. "First, you must get a
parish to sponsor you. Then,
there is a long series of medical
and psychological tests, screen
ing committees and approval
from the bishop. When that's all
over, you are only a candidate for
holy orders."
"One of the worst parts,"
Wendy said, '*was the General
Ordination Examination. This
tests your ability to apply
theological learning to practical
situations. You are given seven
questions to complete in six
days. I submitted 66 typed pages
at the end of the time," she ad
ded.
Wendy attended the General
Convention in Minneapolis last
September that approved the or
dination of women.
Reconciliation
"In Minneapolis, my em
phasis was on reconciliation. At
the 1973 Convention, the wo
men's ordination issue almost
passed. But the proponents were
very militant and gave a very bad
impression. They 'demanded'
that women be ordained. I
wanted to soften that militant
approach," Smith said.
"The Minneapolis Conven-

tion was very different. There
was a very strong sense of the
Holy Spirit," she added.
According to canon law, the
two houses of the Convention
had to pass the women's mea
sure. The House of Bishops pas
sed it by a vote of 96-90. The
House of Deputies, composed of
both clergy and laity, passed the
measure by a close vote, using a
complex voting procedure.
No angry speeches
"Although the vote was close,
there were no angry or bitter
speeches. The emphasis was on
reconciliation," Wendy said.
This change in Church policy
was not simply a matter of wo
men's liberation, but a matter of
interpreting the Bible and
church tradition. Wendy
explained the issues involved.
"Most of the present tradition
is based on assumptions of the
Church Fathers, who lived in the
second through fourth centuries.
They thought women were
physically and mentally inferior
to men and that menstruation
made them spiritually impure.
Today we believe these ideas to
be false," Smith said.
No longer valid
Many of the other traditional
arguments to exclude women
from the priesthood are no
longer valid, according to Smith.
"People will quote some pas
sages from the Apostle Paul
(e.g., But I do not uiJow a woman
to teach or exercise authority
over a man, but remain quiet,' I
Timothy 2:12) to show that
women should not be ordained.
They forget that Paul wrote to a
specific cultural context and not
for us today."
She also said that Jesus up

graded the status of women. He
chose males as apostles simply
because, "the culture at that time
was very patriarchal. No one
would have listened to a woman
apostle. Even so, Paul wrote
about women apostles in Ro
mans 16," according to Smith.
After the fall
"Besides," she said, "the ef
fects of the Fall were wiped out
after Jesus died on the Cross and
rose from the dead. As Paul
wrote in Galatians 3:28, 'There is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither slave nor free man, there
is neither male nor female; for
you are all one in Christ Jesus.'
At the eternal level, earthly
distinctions have no more mean
ing." Smith said.
"Smith's interpretation of

Scripture and Church tradition
is disputed by many. Father
Richard Deitch, Rector of the
Church of the Advent of Christ
the King in San Francisco and
vice president of the Diocesan
Council of the Diocese of
California, disagrees with
Smith.
"I'm opposed to the ordina
tion of women because it was
approved on the basis of wo
men's liberation and not theol
ogy," Deitch said. "This is not to
say that women are not to have
any role in the Church. Women
have very important and inf
luential positions at my
church." he said. "I can't spend

. . the culture at that time was very patriarchial. No
one would have listened to a woman apostle."

any money unless I get permis
sion from our treasurer, who is a
woman."
Status raising
Father Deitch finds support
for his stance from the actions of
Jesus. "Jesus overturned every
social taboo and prejudice of his
day,"he said. "He associated
with prostitutes, tax collectors
and Samaritans. He broke the
Sabbath customs of his day. He
raised the status of women im
mensely. But when he picked
His apostles, Jesus chose men.
He could have selected women,

but He did not. If priests are fol
lowing in the line of the Apos
tles. then we should not ordain
women either," Deitch said.
"God sent his Son in the form
of a male, I don't think God
makes mistakes. He knew what
He was doing," he added.
Arrogant
Finally, Deitch said he
thought it was "arrogant" for the
three million member Episcopal
Ghurch to act on this issue with
out the consensus of the other 67
million Anglicans worldwide.
He added that, "the Episcopal
Ghurch is only one small part of
the holy catholic and apostolic
Ghurch. This issue should be de

cided by an ecumenical council
composed of representatives
from the Roman Catholic
Ghurch, the Orthodox Churches
and the other Anglican
Churches."
Whatever the arguments,
Wendy Smith will be ordained at
8 p.m. on Eeb. 9 at Memorial
Church. She wants to invite the
entire Stanford community to
her ordination. And, as many
have already told her, the biggest
problem might be whether she
should be called, "Mother
Smith."

diaconate to women a few
months after he graduation.
"I started with youth work and
then moved to the diaconate.
This was an important step," she
said, "because every priest must
first be a deacon."
Differences
There are some differences be
tween the two positions," Smith
said. "Both are ordained posi
tions. Deacons can baptize,
marry and bury, but only a priest
can celebrate the Eucharist or
grant absolution.

"I thought I would have to go into education, which
was one of the few church vocations open to women.
I thought it would take 20 or 30 years before the
Church would change its mind."

Entering the Episcopal priest
hood is more rigorous than any
other denomination, according
to Smith. "First, you must get a
parish to sponsor you. Then,
there is a long series of medical
and psychological tests, screen
ing committees and approval
from the bishop. When that's all
over, you are only a candidate for
holy orders."
"One of the worst parts,"
Wendy said, '*was the General
Ordination Examination. This
tests your ability to apply
theological learning to practical
situations. You are given seven
questions to complete in six
days. I submitted 66 typed pages
at the end of the time," she ad
ded.
Wendy attended the General
Convention in Minneapolis last
September that approved the or
dination of women.
Reconciliation
"In Minneapolis, my em
phasis was on reconciliation. At
the 1973 Convention, the wo
men's ordination issue almost
passed. But the proponents were
very militant and gave a very bad
impression. They 'demanded'
that women be ordained. I
wanted to soften that militant
approach," Smith said.
"The Minneapolis Conven-

tion was very different. There
was a very strong sense of the
Holy Spirit," she added.
According to canon law, the
two houses of the Convention
had to pass the women's mea
sure. The House of Bishops pas
sed it by a vote of 96-90. The
House of Deputies, composed of
both clergy and laity, passed the
measure by a close vote, using a
complex voting procedure.
No angry speeches
"Although the vote was close,
there were no angry or bitter
speeches. The emphasis was on
reconciliation," Wendy said.
This change in Church policy
was not simply a matter of wo
men's liberation, but a matter of
interpreting the Bible and
church tradition. Wendy
explained the issues involved.
"Most of the present tradition
is based on assumptions of the
Church Fathers, who lived in the
second through fourth centuries.
They thought women were
physically and mentally inferior
to men and that menstruation
made them spiritually impure.
Today we believe these ideas to
be false," Smith said.
No longer valid
Many of the other traditional
arguments to exclude women
from the priesthood are no
longer valid, according to Smith.
"People will quote some pas
sages from the Apostle Paul
(e.g., But I do not uiJow a woman
to teach or exercise authority
over a man, but remain quiet,' I
Timothy 2:12) to show that
women should not be ordained.
They forget that Paul wrote to a
specific cultural context and not
for us today."
She also said that Jesus up

graded the status of women. He
chose males as apostles simply
because, "the culture at that time
was very patriarchal. No one
would have listened to a woman
apostle. Even so, Paul wrote
about women apostles in Ro
mans 16," according to Smith.
After the fall
"Besides," she said, "the ef
fects of the Fall were wiped out
after Jesus died on the Cross and
rose from the dead. As Paul
wrote in Galatians 3:28, 'There is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither slave nor free man, there
is neither male nor female; for
you are all one in Christ Jesus.'
At the eternal level, earthly
distinctions have no more mean
ing." Smith said.
"Smith's interpretation of

Scripture and Church tradition
is disputed by many. Father
Richard Deitch, Rector of the
Church of the Advent of Christ
the King in San Francisco and
vice president of the Diocesan
Council of the Diocese of
California, disagrees with
Smith.
"I'm opposed to the ordina
tion of women because it was
approved on the basis of wo
men's liberation and not theol
ogy," Deitch said. "This is not to
say that women are not to have
any role in the Church. Women

church." he said. "I can't spend

one would have listened to a woman apostle."

any money unless I get permis
sion from our treasurer, who is a
woman."
Status raising
Father Deitch finds support
for his stance from the actions of
Jesus. "Jesus overturned every
social taboo and prejudice of his
day,"he said. "He associated
with prostitutes, tax collectors
and Samaritans. He broke the
Sabbath customs of his day. He
raised the status of women im
mensely. But when he picked
His apostles, Jesus chose men.
He could have selected women,

but He did not. If priests are fol
lowing in the line of the Apos
tles. then we should not ordain
women either," Deitch said.
"God sent his Son in the form
of a male, I don't think God
makes mistakes. He knew what
He was doing," he added.
Arrogant
Finally, Deitch said he
thought it was "arrogant" for the
three million member Episcopal
Ghurch to act on this issue with
out the consensus of the other 67
million Anglicans worldwide.
He added that, "the Episcopal
Ghurch is only one small part of
the holy catholic and apostolic
Ghurch. This issue should be de

cided by an ecumenical council
composed of representatives
from the Roman Catholic
Ghurch, the Orthodox Churches
and the other Anglican
Churches."
Whatever the arguments,
Wendy Smith will be ordained at
8 p.m. on Eeb. 9 at Memorial
Church. She wants to invite the
entire Stanford community to
her ordination. And, as many
have already told her, the biggest
problem might be whether she
should be called, "Mother
Smith."

Wendy attended the General
Convention in Minneapolis last
September that approved the or
dination of women.
Reconciliation
"In Minneapolis, my em
phasis was on reconciliation. At
the 1973 Convention, the wo
men's ordination issue almost
passed. But the proponents were
very militant and gave a very bad
impression. They 'demanded'
that women be ordained. I
wanted to soften that militant
approach," Smith said.
"The Minneapolis Conven-

tion was very different. There
was a very strong sense of the
Holy Spirit," she added.
According to canon law, the
two houses of the Convention
had to pass the women's mea
sure. The House of Bishops pas
sed it by a vote of 96-90. The
House of Deputies, composed of
both clergy and laity, passed the
measure by a close vote, using a
complex voting procedure.
No angry speeches
"Although the vote was close,
there were no angry or bitter
speeches. The emphasis was on
reconciliation," Wendy said.
This change in Church policy
was not simply a matter of wo
men's liberation, but a matter of
interpreting the Bible and
church tradition. Wendy
explained the issues involved.
"Most of the present tradition
is based on assumptions of the
Church Fathers, who lived in the
second through fourth centuries.
They thought women were
physically and mentally inferior
to men and that menstruation
made them spiritually impure.
Today we believe these ideas to
be false," Smith said.
No longer valid
Many of the other traditional
arguments to exclude women
from the priesthood are no
longer valid, according to Smith.
"People will quote some pas
sages from the Apostle Paul
(e.g., But I do not uiJow a woman
to teach or exercise authority
over a man, but remain quiet,' I
Timothy 2:12) to show that
women should not be ordained.
They forget that Paul wrote to a
specific cultural context and not
for us today."
She also said that Jesus up

graded the status of women. He
chose males as apostles simply
because, "the culture at that time
was very patriarchal. No one
would have listened to a woman
apostle. Even so, Paul wrote
about women apostles in Ro
mans 16," according to Smith.
After the fall
"Besides," she said, "the ef
fects of the Fall were wiped out
after Jesus died on the Cross and
rose from the dead. As Paul
wrote in Galatians 3:28, 'There is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither slave nor free man, there
is neither male nor female; for
you are all one in Christ Jesus.'
At the eternal level, earthly
distinctions have no more mean
ing." Smith said.
"Smith's interpretation of

Scripture and Church tradition
is disputed by many. Father
Richard Deitch, Rector of the
Church of the Advent of Christ
the King in San Francisco and
vice president of the Diocesan
Council of the Diocese of
California, disagrees with
Smith.
"I'm opposed to the ordina
tion of women because it was
approved on the basis of wo

sion from our treasurer, who is a
woman."
Status raising
Father Deitch finds support
for his stance from the actions of
Jesus. "Jesus overturned every
social taboo and prejudice of his
day,"he said. "He associated
with prostitutes, tax collectors
and Samaritans. He broke the
Sabbath customs of his day. He
raised the status of women im
mensely. But when he picked
His apostles, Jesus chose men.
He could have selected women,

but He did not. If priests are fol
lowing in the line of the Apos
tles. then we should not ordain
women either," Deitch said.
"God sent his Son in the form
of a male, I don't think God
makes mistakes. He knew what
He was doing," he added.
Arrogant
Finally, Deitch said he
thought it was "arrogant" for the
three million member Episcopal
Ghurch to act on this issue with
out the consensus of the other 67
million Anglicans worldwide.
He added that, "the Episcopal
Ghurch is only one small part of
the holy catholic and apostolic
Ghurch. This issue should be de

cided by an ecumenical council
composed of representatives
from the Roman Catholic
Ghurch, the Orthodox Churches
and the other Anglican
Churches."
Whatever the arguments,
Wendy Smith will be ordained at
8 p.m. on Eeb. 9 at Memorial
Church. She wants to invite the
entire Stanford community to
her ordination. And, as many
have already told her, the biggest
problem might be whether she
should be called, "Mother
Smith."


Wendy Smith ~ Da,ly pho, ° by Usa Cannon
The Episcopal Church has
never had women priests. That
is, until this year. Last Sep
tember, the General Convention
of the Episcopal Church broke
with 2000 years of tradition and
approved the ordination of
women starting Jan. 1, 1977.
Asst. Dean of the Chapel Wendy
Smith will become one of the
first women priests when she is
ordained in Memorial Church on
Feb. 9.
Smith became interested in
the ministry when she took clas
ses from Stanford's Dean of the
Chapel, Robert Hamerton-kelly,
at Scripps College in Claremont.
"After I graduated in 1968, I
went to Harvard Divinity
School," Smith said. "I wanted
to serve in the Christian minis
try. I thought I would have to go
into education, which was one of
the few church vocations open to
women. I thought it would take
20 or 30 years before the Church
would change its mind."
She graduated from Harvard
with a master's in theology in
1970. She then became very in
volved with the Episcopal
Church when they opened the
diaconate to women a few
months after he graduation.
"I started with youth work and
then moved to the diaconate.
This was an important step," she
said, "because every priest must
first be a deacon."
Differences
There are some differences be
tween the two positions," Smith
said. "Both are ordained posi
tions. Deacons can baptize,
marry and bury, but only a priest
can celebrate the Eucharist or
grant absolution.

"I thought I would have to go into education, which
was one of the few church vocations open to women.
I thought it would take 20 or 30 years before the

Entering the Episcopal priest
hood is more rigorous than any
other denomination, according
to Smith. "First, you must get a
parish to sponsor you. Then,
there is a long series of medical
and psychological tests, screen
ing committees and approval
from the bishop. When that's all
over, you are only a candidate for
holy orders."

reconciliation," Wendy said.
This change in Church policy
was not simply a matter of wo
men's liberation, but a matter of
interpreting the Bible and
church tradition. Wendy
explained the issues involved.
"Most of the present tradition
is based on assumptions of the
Church Fathers, who lived in the
second through fourth centuries.
They thought women were
physically and mentally inferior
to men and that menstruation
made them spiritually impure.
Today we believe these ideas to
be false," Smith said.
No longer valid
Many of the other traditional
arguments to exclude women
from the priesthood are no
longer valid, according to Smith.
"People will quote some pas
sages from the Apostle Paul
(e.g., But I do not uiJow a woman
to teach or exercise authority
over a man, but remain quiet,' I
Timothy 2:12) to show that
women should not be ordained.
They forget that Paul wrote to a
specific cultural context and not
for us today."
She also said that Jesus up

graded the status of women. He
chose males as apostles simply
because, "the culture at that time
was very patriarchal. No one
would have listened to a woman
apostle. Even so, Paul wrote
about women apostles in Ro
mans 16," according to Smith.
After the fall
"Besides," she said, "the ef
fects of the Fall were wiped out
after Jesus died on the Cross and
rose from the dead. As Paul
wrote in Galatians 3:28, 'There is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither slave nor free man, there
is neither male nor female; for
you are all one in Christ Jesus.'
At the eternal level, earthly
distinctions have no more mean

"Smith's interpretation of

Scripture and Church tradition
is disputed by many. Father
Richard Deitch, Rector of the
Church of the Advent of Christ
the King in San Francisco and
vice president of the Diocesan
Council of the Diocese of
California, disagrees with
Smith.
"I'm opposed to the ordina
tion of women because it was
approved on the basis of wo
men's liberation and not theol
ogy," Deitch said. "This is not to
say that women are not to have

sion from our treasurer, who is a
woman."
Status raising
Father Deitch finds support
for his stance from the actions of
Jesus. "Jesus overturned every
social taboo and prejudice of his
day,"he said. "He associated
with prostitutes, tax collectors
and Samaritans. He broke the
Sabbath customs of his day. He
raised the status of women im
mensely. But when he picked
His apostles, Jesus chose men.
He could have selected women,

but He did not. If priests are fol
lowing in the line of the Apos
tles. then we should not ordain
women either," Deitch said.
"God sent his Son in the form
of a male, I don't think God
makes mistakes. He knew what
He was doing," he added.
Arrogant
Finally, Deitch said he
thought it was "arrogant" for the
three million member Episcopal
Ghurch to act on this issue with
out the consensus of the other 67
million Anglicans worldwide.
He added that, "the Episcopal
Ghurch is only one small part of
the holy catholic and apostolic
Ghurch. This issue should be de

cided by an ecumenical council
composed of representatives
from the Roman Catholic
Ghurch, the Orthodox Churches
and the other Anglican
Churches."
Whatever the arguments,
Wendy Smith will be ordained at
8 p.m. on Eeb. 9 at Memorial
Church. She wants to invite the
entire Stanford community to
her ordination. And, as many
have already told her, the biggest
problem might be whether she
should be called, "Mother
Smith."


Wendy Smith ~ Da,ly pho, ° by Usa Cannon
The Episcopal Church has
never had women priests. That
is, until this year. Last Sep
tember, the General Convention
of the Episcopal Church broke
with 2000 years of tradition and
approved the ordination of
women starting Jan. 1, 1977.
Asst. Dean of the Chapel Wendy
Smith will become one of the
first women priests when she is
ordained in Memorial Church on
Feb. 9.
Smith became interested in
the ministry when she took clas
ses from Stanford's Dean of the
Chapel, Robert Hamerton-kelly,
at Scripps College in Claremont.
"After I graduated in 1968, I
went to Harvard Divinity
School," Smith said. "I wanted
to serve in the Christian minis
try. I thought I would have to go
into education, which was one of
the few church vocations open to
women. I thought it would take
20 or 30 years before the Church
would change its mind."
She graduated from Harvard
with a master's in theology in
1970. She then became very in
volved with the Episcopal
Church when they opened the
diaconate to women a few
months after he graduation.
"I started with youth work and
then moved to the diaconate.
This was an important step," she
said, "because every priest must
first be a deacon."
Differences
There are some differences be
tween the two positions," Smith
said. "Both are ordained posi
tions. Deacons can baptize,
marry and bury, but only a priest
can celebrate the Eucharist or
grant absolution.

"I thought I would have to go into education, which
was one of the few church vocations open to women.
I thought it would take 20 or 30 years before the
Church would change its mind."

Entering the Episcopal priest
hood is more rigorous than any
other denomination, according
to Smith. "First, you must get a
parish to sponsor you. Then,
there is a long series of medical
and psychological tests, screen
ing committees and approval
from the bishop. When that's all
over, you are only a candidate for
holy orders."
"One of the worst parts,"
Wendy said, '*was the General
Ordination Examination. This
tests your ability to apply
theological learning to practical
situations. You are given seven
questions to complete in six
days. I submitted 66 typed pages
at the end of the time," she ad
ded.
Wendy attended the General
Convention in Minneapolis last
September that approved the or
dination of women.
Reconciliation
"In Minneapolis, my em
phasis was on reconciliation. At
the 1973 Convention, the wo
men's ordination issue almost
passed. But the proponents were
very militant and gave a very bad
impression. They 'demanded'
that women be ordained. I
wanted to soften that militant
approach," Smith said.
"The Minneapolis Conven-

tion was very different. There
was a very strong sense of the
Holy Spirit," she added.
According to canon law, the
two houses of the Convention
had to pass the women's mea
sure. The House of Bishops pas
sed it by a vote of 96-90. The
House of Deputies, composed of
both clergy and laity, passed the
measure by a close vote, using a
complex voting procedure.
No angry speeches
"Although the vote was close,
there were no angry or bitter
speeches. The emphasis was on
reconciliation," Wendy said.
This change in Church policy
was not simply a matter of wo
men's liberation, but a matter of
interpreting the Bible and
