# 'Society doesn't understand'
## Prostitute advocates decriminalized regulation 
### Marc Strassman 
fact that "we have a society that
does not recognize sexuality as a
basic need. Society doesn't un
derstand sexuality and prostitu
tion and therefore fears it," she
said.
She said that "a prostitute was
a symptom of society's inability
to deal with communication
about sexuality," and she gave
two examples from her own ex
perience to support this conten
tion.
She related how a client of
hers had confessed that he had
"this fantasy, something he had
wanted to try for eight or nine
years, ever since he'd been mar
ried." Newby said that this wor
ried her, as she imagined all
sorts of dreadful possibilities.
She encouraged him to tell her
his fantasy, and finally, he reluc
tantly blurted out that he would
like to have intercourse "in a
position other than missionary."
Be assertive
Newby commented that this
demonstrated a severe "lack of
communication" between her
client and the woman he had
been married to for almost a de
cade. "Why not be more asser
tive? Why didn't he just flip her
over?" she asked rhetorically,
and concluded the story by
commenting that "he paid a hell
of a lot to try another position."
Her second example involved
"a beautiful room," with wood
paneling, thick carpets, a large
brass bed with red satin sheets,
and an ornate chandelier that
glowed softly, filling the room
with "subtle lighting. It's my
favorite room to work in,"

"Ninety per cent or more of the
women who are prostitutes are
prostitutes for one very good
reason that B.F. Skinner would
really understand: the reward is
high enough to get the be
havior," according to Randa
Newby, chief of the speaker's
bureau of COYOTE (Call Off
Your Old Tired Ethics) or, as she
called it, the "Hookers Union."
Newby argued that the prim
ary cause of prostitution is
economic, saying that women
usually become "working wo
men" because society offers
them no other opportunities to
earn an adequate living.
"Secretaries aren't paid very
much," she pointed out, saying
that it was typical for
businessmen to pay their sec
retaries $550 a month, hardly
enough to survive on in a big
city, and then solicit each others
secretaries to go to bed with
them for $100.
"It's the businessman who is
the criminal. Something is
wrong with the society if you
have to break the laws to sur
vive," she said.
Newby made these remarks
while speaking to an audience of
around 250 people, in the Tre
sidder Large Lounge last Thurs
day night in the second of an
eight-part Tresidder Thursday
Evening Lecture Series. The sub
ject of the series for winter quar
ter is "A Look at the Turbulent
605."
Lack of understanding
Newby attributed public out
cries against prostitution to the

Newby commented.
These amenities were appa
rently lost on her client, because
before they could begin, he
asked her, "Aren't you going to
turn off the lights?" Not wanting
to embarrass him, she
apologized profusely, saying,
"Oh, sorry, 1 forgot," and got out
of bed to turn off the lights. Re
turning in the dark, she stubbed

her foot, destroying her rnood,
and could hardly "fake being
nice" for the rest of the time she
was with him.
To secure women's rights
Newby said that COYOTE's ef
forts on behalf of prostitutes
grew out of the larger women's
movement and the movement
for civil rights of the 19605. The
basic goal of her organization.

she said, is to secure "women's
rights to their own bodies, the
right not to be considered sub
human, or subordinate to the
male."
She said that more severe
penalties for prostitution than
for theft seem to indicate society
believes "going to bed with a
man is more disgusting than
ripping someone off."
Crime 'for the act'
She pointed out that being a
prostitute was not a crime; ar
rests, she said, can only be made
on account of "soliciting for the
act, or for the act."
And most ot the time, there is
no need for a woman to solicit,
she said. All a woman has to do
in order to be solicited by a man
is to go into town and "walk
slower than a fast run."
During the question and ans
wer period that followed her
talk, Newby explained
COYOTE's preferences regard
ing the future legal status of
prostitution.
"We oppose straight legaliza
tion; we would approve a 'regu
lated situation' " solution, she
said.
The problems with legaliza
tion, she argued, include giving
vice squads the authority to
issue "hooker passes" and pros
titutes having no choice of the
hours they would work or the
persons they would have as
clients.
Regulated situations (through
decriminalization), on the other
hand, would take prostitution
"off the books" and establish
committees, including prosti

tutes, to regulate the trade.
Newby suggested that prosti
tutes could be issued
"passports " that would he like
health cards, and would agree to
"maybe leave certain sections —
like around school kids —
alone."
Prostitutes who violate the
code of regulations, she said,
would be issued "citations like
parking tickets," and if a prosti
tute accumulated too many cita
tions, her license would be re
voked.
She mentioned in this regard
that many housewife friends of
hers have told her that they'd go
to wurk with her if they weren't
afraid of being arrested.
June initiative
Newby said that with the help
of the California JC's (Junior
Chamber of Commerce),
COYOTE would be putting an
initiative on the June ballot to
decriminalize prostitution.
Guilt and lack of money are
what keep more women from
using male prostitutes, Newby
argued. Other factors preventing
women from hiring men in this
capacity are the fact that a
woman "needs a longer time"
and that men can't always be
counted on to perform sexually,
which is easier for a woman,
given their respective
anatomies, said Newby.
Newby is writing a master's
thesis on male sexuality as part
of her academic work at San
Francisco State. She said she
hopes to sell it to Penthouse
magazine and then to enroll in a
Ph.D. program, hopefully, here.

rights to their own bodies, the
right not to be considered sub
human, or subordinate to the
male."
She said that more severe
penalties for prostitution than
for theft seem to indicate society
believes "going to bed with a
man is more disgusting than
ripping someone off."
Crime 'for the act'
She pointed out that being a
prostitute was not a crime; ar
rests, she said, can only be made
on account of "soliciting for the
act, or for the act."
And most ot the time, there is
no need for a woman to solicit,
she said. All a woman has to do
in order to be solicited by a man
is to go into town and "walk
slower than a fast run."
During the question and ans
wer period that followed her
talk, Newby explained
COYOTE's preferences regard
ing the future legal status of
prostitution.
"We oppose straight legaliza
tion; we would approve a 'regu
lated situation' " solution, she
said.
The problems with legaliza
tion, she argued, include giving
vice squads the authority to
issue "hooker passes" and pros
titutes having no choice of the
hours they would work or the
persons they would have as
clients.
Regulated situations (through
decriminalization), on the other
hand, would take prostitution
"off the books" and establish
committees, including prosti

tutes, to regulate the trade.
Newby suggested that prosti
tutes could be issued
"passports " that would he like
health cards, and would agree to
"maybe leave certain sections —
like around school kids —
alone."
Prostitutes who violate the
code of regulations, she said,
would be issued "citations like
parking tickets," and if a prosti
tute accumulated too many cita
tions, her license would be re
voked.
She mentioned in this regard
that many housewife friends of
hers have told her that they'd go
to wurk with her if they weren't
afraid of being arrested.
June initiative
Newby said that with the help
of the California JC's (Junior
Chamber of Commerce),
COYOTE would be putting an
initiative on the June ballot to
decriminalize prostitution.
Guilt and lack of money are
what keep more women from
using male prostitutes, Newby
argued. Other factors preventing
women from hiring men in this
capacity are the fact that a
woman "needs a longer time"
and that men can't always be
counted on to perform sexually,
which is easier for a woman,
given their respective
anatomies, said Newby.
Newby is writing a master's
thesis on male sexuality as part
of her academic work at San
Francisco State. She said she
hopes to sell it to Penthouse
magazine and then to enroll in a
Ph.D. program, hopefully, here.

Sex not a crime?
Randa Newby, chief of the speaker's bu reau for COYOTE (Call
Off Your Old Tired Ethics) called for decriminalization with legal
regulation of the "world's oldest profession" at a lecture in
Tresidder Large Lounge last Thursday.
fact that "we have a society that
does not recognize sexuality as a
basic need. Society doesn't un
derstand sexuality and prostitu
tion and therefore fears it," she
said.
She said that "a prostitute was
a symptom of society's inability
to deal with communication
about sexuality," and she gave
two examples from her own ex
perience to support this conten
tion.
She related how a client of
hers had confessed that he had
"this fantasy, something he had
wanted to try for eight or nine
years, ever since he'd been mar
ried." Newby said that this wor
ried her, as she imagined all
sorts of dreadful possibilities.
She encouraged him to tell her
his fantasy, and finally, he reluc
tantly blurted out that he would
like to have intercourse "in a
position other than missionary."
Be assertive
Newby commented that this
demonstrated a severe "lack of
communication" between her
client and the woman he had
been married to for almost a de
cade. "Why not be more asser
tive? Why didn't he just flip her
over?" she asked rhetorically,
and concluded the story by
commenting that "he paid a hell
of a lot to try another position."
Her second example involved
"a beautiful room," with wood
paneling, thick carpets, a large
brass bed with red satin sheets,
and an ornate chandelier that
glowed softly, filling the room
with "subtle lighting. It's my
favorite room to work in,"

"Ninety per cent or more of the
women who are prostitutes are
prostitutes for one very good
reason that B.F. Skinner would
really understand: the reward is
high enough to get the be
havior," according to Randa
Newby, chief of the speaker's
bureau of COYOTE (Call Off
Your Old Tired Ethics) or, as she
called it, the "Hookers Union."
Newby argued that the prim
ary cause of prostitution is
economic, saying that women
usually become "working wo
men" because society offers
them no other opportunities to
earn an adequate living.
"Secretaries aren't paid very
much," she pointed out, saying
that it was typical for
businessmen to pay their sec
retaries $550 a month, hardly
enough to survive on in a big
city, and then solicit each others
secretaries to go to bed with
them for $100.
"It's the businessman who is
the criminal. Something is
wrong with the society if you
have to break the laws to sur
vive," she said.
Newby made these remarks
while speaking to an audience of
around 250 people, in the Tre
sidder Large Lounge last Thurs
day night in the second of an
eight-part Tresidder Thursday
Evening Lecture Series. The sub
ject of the series for winter quar
ter is "A Look at the Turbulent
605."
Lack of understanding

Newby commented.
These amenities were appa
rently lost on her client, because
before they could begin, he
asked her, "Aren't you going to
turn off the lights?" Not wanting
to embarrass him, she
apologized profusely, saying,
"Oh, sorry, 1 forgot," and got out
of bed to turn off the lights. Re
turning in the dark, she stubbed

her foot, destroying her rnood,
and could hardly "fake being
nice" for the rest of the time she
was with him.
To secure women's rights

forts on behalf of prostitutes
grew out of the larger women's
movement and the movement
for civil rights of the 19605. The

his fantasy, and finally, he reluc
tantly blurted out that he would
like to have intercourse "in a
position other than missionary."
Be assertive
Newby commented that this
demonstrated a severe "lack of
communication" between her
client and the woman he had
been married to for almost a de
cade. "Why not be more asser
tive? Why didn't he just flip her
over?" she asked rhetorically,
and concluded the story by
commenting that "he paid a hell
of a lot to try another position."
Her second example involved
"a beautiful room," with wood
paneling, thick carpets, a large
brass bed with red satin sheets,
and an ornate chandelier that
glowed softly, filling the room
with "subtle lighting. It's my
favorite room to work in,"

"Ninety per cent or more of the
women who are prostitutes are
prostitutes for one very good
reason that B.F. Skinner would
really understand: the reward is
high enough to get the be
havior," according to Randa
Newby, chief of the speaker's
bureau of COYOTE (Call Off
Your Old Tired Ethics) or, as she
called it, the "Hookers Union."
Newby argued that the prim
ary cause of prostitution is
economic, saying that women
usually become "working wo
men" because society offers
them no other opportunities to
earn an adequate living.
"Secretaries aren't paid very
much," she pointed out, saying
that it was typical for
businessmen to pay their sec
retaries $550 a month, hardly
enough to survive on in a big
city, and then solicit each others
secretaries to go to bed with
them for $100.
"It's the businessman who is
the criminal. Something is
wrong with the society if you
have to break the laws to sur
vive," she said.
Newby made these remarks
while speaking to an audience of
around 250 people, in the Tre
sidder Large Lounge last Thurs
day night in the second of an
eight-part Tresidder Thursday
Evening Lecture Series. The sub
ject of the series for winter quar
ter is "A Look at the Turbulent
605."
Lack of understanding
Newby attributed public out
cries against prostitution to the

Newby commented.
These amenities were appa
rently lost on her client, because
before they could begin, he
asked her, "Aren't you going to
turn off the lights?" Not wanting
to embarrass him, she
apologized profusely, saying,
"Oh, sorry, 1 forgot," and got out
of bed to turn off the lights. Re
turning in the dark, she stubbed

her foot, destroying her rnood,
and could hardly "fake being
nice" for the rest of the time she
was with him.
To secure women's rights
Newby said that COYOTE's ef
forts on behalf of prostitutes
grew out of the larger women's
movement and the movement
for civil rights of the 19605. The
basic goal of her organization.

she said, is to secure "women's
rights to their own bodies, the
right not to be considered sub
human, or subordinate to the
male."
She said that more severe
penalties for prostitution than
for theft seem to indicate society
believes "going to bed with a
man is more disgusting than
ripping someone off."
Crime 'for the act'
She pointed out that being a
prostitute was not a crime; ar
rests, she said, can only be made
on account of "soliciting for the
act, or for the act."
And most ot the time, there is
no need for a woman to solicit,
she said. All a woman has to do
in order to be solicited by a man
is to go into town and "walk
slower than a fast run."
During the question and ans
wer period that followed her
talk, Newby explained
COYOTE's preferences regard
ing the future legal status of
prostitution.
"We oppose straight legaliza
tion; we would approve a 'regu
lated situation' " solution, she
said.
The problems with legaliza
tion, she argued, include giving
vice squads the authority to
issue "hooker passes" and pros
titutes having no choice of the
hours they would work or the
persons they would have as
clients.
Regulated situations (through
decriminalization), on the other
hand, would take prostitution
"off the books" and establish
committees, including prosti

tutes, to regulate the trade.
Newby suggested that prosti
tutes could be issued
"passports " that would he like
health cards, and would agree to
"maybe leave certain sections —
like around school kids —
alone."
Prostitutes who violate the
code of regulations, she said,
would be issued "citations like
parking tickets," and if a prosti
tute accumulated too many cita
tions, her license would be re
voked.
She mentioned in this regard
that many housewife friends of
hers have told her that they'd go
to wurk with her if they weren't
afraid of being arrested.
June initiative
Newby said that with the help
of the California JC's (Junior
Chamber of Commerce),
COYOTE would be putting an
initiative on the June ballot to
decriminalize prostitution.
Guilt and lack of money are
what keep more women from
using male prostitutes, Newby
argued. Other factors preventing
women from hiring men in this
capacity are the fact that a
woman "needs a longer time"
and that men can't always be
counted on to perform sexually,
which is easier for a woman,
given their respective
anatomies, said Newby.
Newby is writing a master's
thesis on male sexuality as part
of her academic work at San
Francisco State. She said she
hopes to sell it to Penthouse
magazine and then to enroll in a
Ph.D. program, hopefully, here.

talk, Newby explained
COYOTE's preferences regard
ing the future legal status of
prostitution.
"We oppose straight legaliza
tion; we would approve a 'regu
lated situation' " solution, she
said.
The problems with legaliza
tion, she argued, include giving
vice squads the authority to
issue "hooker passes" and pros
titutes having no choice of the
hours they would work or the
persons they would have as
clients.
Regulated situations (through
decriminalization), on the other
hand, would take prostitution
"off the books" and establish
committees, including prosti

tutes, to regulate the trade.
Newby suggested that prosti
tutes could be issued
"passports " that would he like
health cards, and would agree to
"maybe leave certain sections —
like around school kids —
alone."
Prostitutes who violate the
code of regulations, she said,
would be issued "citations like
parking tickets," and if a prosti
tute accumulated too many cita
tions, her license would be re
voked.
She mentioned in this regard
that many housewife friends of
hers have told her that they'd go
to wurk with her if they weren't
afraid of being arrested.
June initiative
Newby said that with the help
of the California JC's (Junior
Chamber of Commerce),
COYOTE would be putting an
initiative on the June ballot to
decriminalize prostitution.
Guilt and lack of money are
what keep more women from
using male prostitutes, Newby
argued. Other factors preventing
women from hiring men in this
capacity are the fact that a
woman "needs a longer time"
and that men can't always be
counted on to perform sexually,
which is easier for a woman,
given their respective
anatomies, said Newby.
Newby is writing a master's
thesis on male sexuality as part
of her academic work at San
Francisco State. She said she
hopes to sell it to Penthouse
magazine and then to enroll in a
Ph.D. program, hopefully, here.
