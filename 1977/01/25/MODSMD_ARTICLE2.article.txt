# Business, education schools get top rating
## 
### Fred Cheever 
The graduate schools of business
and education here are ranked first in
the nation, according to a nationwide
survey of 453 educators sponsored by
the University of California Academic
Senate.
The School here was ranked
third in the nation according to the
survey which updates a 1969 survey of
146 deans where the university was
ranked first in education, second in
business and sixth in law.
This year's survey results were pub
lished in the February issue of Change
Magazine. The survey did not include
medical schools.
Private universities took the three
top positions in all three fields covered
by the study. UCLA and UC-Berkeley
led the pack among public institu
tions.
The report termed the School of
Education here "preeminent" in the
field, rating far better than Harvard,
which took second place in the survey.
Education school Dean Arthur Col
adarci said he was gratified but not
surprised by the findings. He attri
buted the success to "a strong faculty
and a well selected student body."
Heads the pack
In recent years other less extensive
surveys have also given top ratings to
the School of Education here. The top
10 schools in the field of education in
order were Stanford, Harvard,
Chicago. UCLA, Berkeley, Wisconsin,
Columbia, Ohio State, Michigan and
Illinois, with the last three tied in the
ratings.
Stanford School of Business top rat
ing came as no surprise. Assoc. Dean
James VanHorne attributed the first
place standing to "good overall per
formance" and stated that the School
of Business possessed "excellence ac
ross both teaching and research."
The top 10 schools in business in
order were Stanford. Harvard. MIT,
Chicago, Carnegie Melon, Berkeley.
Pennsylvania, UCLA, Northwestern
and Cornell.
leap forward
Stanford Law School's third place
standing showed dramatic improve
ment from its sixth place position in
the 1969 survey. The Law School,
which moved into its new quarters in
1975, is receiving increased recogni
tion for the caliber of its relatively
voung faculty.
Curriculum changes adopted by the
school several years ago have now be
come models in the law field. The top
10 ranked schools in law in order were
Harvard. Yale, Stanford, Michigan,
Chicago. Berkeley, Columbia.
Pennsylvania, Virginia and UCLA.

The survey, similar to the 1969 sur
vey, rated both "faculty quality" and
"academic attractiveness." The Law
School here came in third in "faculty
quality" behind Harvard and Yale, and
second in "academic attractiveness"
behind Yale.
Both Coladarci and VanHorne ex
pressed some doubt about the accu
racy of the survey. Both said they felt
that it was an opinion poll and re
flected highly subjective feelings
within the educational community.
Coladarci stated that he felt the rat
ing of the top schools was probably
accurate, but that the ratings of the
smaller schools were probably less ac
curate.
