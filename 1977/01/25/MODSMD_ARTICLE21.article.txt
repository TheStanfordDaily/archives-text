# Student responsibility has played central role in development of Honor Code at Stanford
## 
### 
The central operational meaning of the Hou.v Code at
Stanford is delegation to students of primary responsibility
for honesty in academic work, according to the Student
Conduct Legislative Committee.
By unanimous vote, the SCLC agrees with former Aca
demic Secretary H. Donald Winbigler that "the most crucial
question appears to be whether students of the present and
future will be willing to assume that responsibility and devote
the effort necessary:
"A) to achieve a new student consensus on applications
of the Honor Code which will be appropriate to the contem
porary milieu and climate of opinion;
"B) to devise mechanisms which will assure the effective
ness of those applications, as student attitudes continue to
change; and
"CI to provide for the perpetuation of such mecha
nisms."
The SCLC requested Winbigler to write a history of the
development of the Honor Code at Stanford, published in
in The Daily columns below. It adopted this portion of his
report as a starting point for its own deliberations.
Individuals interested in commenting on the Honor Code
may do so by contacting Prof. Philip Rhinelander, philo
sophy (ext. 7-2586 or 325-0909). Written comments are
especially welcome. These may be sent to Rhinelander in care
of James Siena, legal adviser to President Richard W. Lyman,

OBSERVATIONS ON THE BACKGROUND
OF THE STANFORD HONOR CODE
1891 to 1965
The following account is based upon an oral report
submitted to the Student Conduct Legislative Council on
March 4, 1976, by H. Donald Winbigler, formerly dean of
students, ft is the product of an effort to marshal informa
tion from the period of 1891 to 1965 which will contribute
to the current deliberations on the present status and future
of the Stanford Honor Code. In this account particular
attention is given to the context in which the honor system
originated and was developed at Stanford.
The founding grant of the University charged the Trustees
to give to the President of the University sweeping responsi
bilities, with commensurate powers, which were not explicit
with respect to student conduct and discipline, but which
were clearly understood to include this aspect of student
affairs.
From the opening of the University in 1891, President
David Starr Jordan exercised this responsibility, largely
through a Committee on Student Affairs appointed by him.
The first Stanford Register contained the following statement
which reflects President Jordan's philosophy and, no doubt,
was formulated by him:
In the government of the University, the largest liberty
consistent with good work and good order will be given to
the students. The University is not a reform school; its
bounty is intended for the earnest and industrious student,
and the indolent or unworthy will not be retained in the
institution.
The Register, which was issued annually from 1892 to
1947, was a year-end publication which was essentially a
compilation of the documents now identified as Courses and
Degrees, Information, Faculty-Staff Directory, Student Di
rectory and the Commencement Program. By 1895-96, the
statement cited above had been revised to read as it appears
below, and in this form, it was carried in the Register for
many years:
In the government of the University, the largest liberty
consistent with good work and good order is allowed.
Students are expected to show, both within and without the
University, such respect for order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is demanded of good citizens.
Failure to do this will be sufficient cause for removal from
the University.
The language of the final two sentences cited has a
familiar ring to many generations of Stanford students as a
result of its later incorporation in the formulation of The
Fundamental Standard.
In the early years there was so little congruence between
undergraduate ebullience and faculty notions of the decorum
"demanded of good citizens" that serving on the Committee
on Student Affairs was hazardous. As souvenirs of member
ship on the Committee, its veterans in many cases bore scars,
emotional if not physical.
It may be of some interest now that an early chairman of
the committee was John M. Stillman, professor of chemistry
and grandfather of Rev. John Duryea, recently chaplain at St.
Anne's Chapel in Palo Alto. At another time, the chairman
was Arthur B. Clark, father of Birge M. Clark, local architect
and lecturer, emeritus, in architecture.
During the first 13 years of the University's existence, the
faculty was gradually assuming more collective responsibili
ties, not only through membership on committees, but
through a faculty-wide body, known as the University
Council, which was advisory to the President and was
composed of all associate and full professors. The chief
matters entrusted specifically to the Council were: 1) require
ments for admission, b) requirements for degrees, and c) the
recommendation of candidates for degrees.
In 1904, a full decade after Senator Stanford's death, Mrs.
Stanford was in the process of divesting herself of her special
role as the surviving Founder of the institution and of
establishing the Board of Trustees as the permanent gov
erning body of the institution, becoming herself just one of
the trustees. The Board had existed from the beginning of the
University, but its role had earlier been subordinate in many
respects to that of the Founders.
Many crucial questions were then raised regarding the
balance of authority and responsibility among the Trustees,
the President and the faculty. Several of these questions were
tesolved officially in the Articles of Organization of the
Faculty, which was adopted by the Board of Trustees on
March 31, 1904, as an outgrowth of an extensive study by a
committee of the faculty and a committee of the Trustees
working jointly.
The Articles contain four provisions which are particular
ly relevant to the present subject. The first defined a
responsibility and duty of the President as follows:
The President shall be primarily responsible for the
enforcement of discipline in the University.
The second was a provision for the establishment of the
Academic Council as the voting body of the faculty, succes
soi to the University Council.
The third was a provision for the assignment to the
Academic Council of a few specific duties, along with one
marvelously general authorization stated as follows:
The Academic Council is vested with all the powers and
duties usually vested in the faculties of similar institutions to
discuss and decide upon all matters of internal policy, except
as herein otherwise provided,
The fourth was a provision for two categories of commit
tee, academic and administrative, with the Committee on
Student Affairs being continued and specified as an adminis
trative committee. Academic committees were appointed by
the Executive Committee of the Academic Council, and
administrative committees by the President.
During the next decade, under the Articles of Organiza
tion, the faculty increased its exercise of collective responsi
bility, both through the Academic Council directly and
through academic and administrative committees.
In a similar development, Stanford students expressed a
desire and willingness to assume greater collective responsi
bility in the area of student affairs. The primary media for
these expressions were the Associated Students and parallel
organizations of women students and men students, known
as Women's Conference and Men's Conference, respectively.
Within the ASSU. executive and legislative functions were
merged in an Executive Committee (Ex Com), which was
composed of maior student officers elected from the student
body at large, ano representatives of various student constitu
encies e'ected by the respective constituencies. Women's
Conference survived into the sixties as the Associated Women
Students (AWS) of Stanford University Men's Conference
was short lived.

The Register for the academic year 1914-15 records the
following:
In 1911-12, the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs
entered into an agreement with the University Conferences
by which responsibility for the government of students and
for maintaining University standards was assumed by the men
and women of the University.
It is quite probable that faculty frustration, stemming
from the efforts of the Committee over two decades to cope
with its responsibilities, was a strong inducement for trying
out this further delegation to the students.
In any event this agreement marked the beginning of
Stanford's student judicial councils, viz.. Women's Council
and Men's Council. For women, this delegation of responsi
bility continued without interruption for some 55 years. For
men, it was suspended in 1918 by the then President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and was resumed during the academic year
1919-1920.
It was also under this agreement that the students, largely
through standing committees, formulated the Fundamental
Standard, incorporating in it the familiar Jordan language. No
need was then felt for a codification of the Standard, and it
was taken for granted that it embraced the observance of
University regulations, irrespective of their source.
A by-product of the upsurge of student responsibility in
the late teens was experimentation with an honor system,
primarily in the Law School, but also to a lesser extent in
other departments. The ASSU promoted the idea of a
University-wide honor system, making a presentation on the
subject to the Academic Council as early as May of 1914.
In the spring of 1921, after a seven-year campaign by
students, when the total enrollment of the institution was
2,333, some 1,700 students signed individual petitions to the
faculty, asking that the honor system be extended to the
entire campus.
On May 23, 1921, the Academic Council, on recommen
dation of its Executive Committee, took action to establish a
campus-wide honor system. The Executive Committee had
developed the proposal with the assistance, collaboration and
urging of students. Whatever meanings may have been read
into the Stanford Honor Code subsequently, its original
concept and intent were made abundantly clear in the
language of the Academic Council action, which deserves
careful attention, and which is recorded in the Minutes of the
Council as follows.
The original motion for the adoption of the Committee
proposal, with amendments, was then put to vote and
adopted as follows:
1. Responsibility for honesty in the conduct of examina
tions is assumed by the students of the University, such
responsibility to be known as the Honor System.
2. The primary responsibility for the Honor System rests
upon each individual student who is pledged not to receive or
give aid in examinations.
3. Collective responsibility for the Honor System within
a department of the University should be accepted by the
major students of that department. Through existing depart
mental organizations or otherwise such major students should
take special cjre that the system is conserved and strength
ened within the department. It is hoped that they may
receive the encouragement and cooperation of the instructors
in the department in their efforts to this end.
4. The Student Councils shall have general supervisory
control over the conduct of examinations, and may adopt
regulations and suggestions for the same. Such control may
be exercised through the department groups of major stu
dents, wherever such method is found to be effective. But
when need arises, the Councils shall take direct control of the
conduct of examinations in a particular course or group of
courses.
5. The Student Councils shall, with the approval of the
President of the University, prepare a statement for all new
students to sign, such statement to be included among the
Registrar's matriculation blanks, and rules and suggestions for
the conduct of examinations to be printed upon the examina
tion blanks furnished by the University.
6. Infractions of the Honor System shall be dealt with by
the Student Councils in the same manner as other cases of
discipline.
7. The upper division students shall create a committee
to be known as the Honor System Committee, which shall
arrange for assemblies of new students early in each quarter
for the purpose of explaining the Honor System, shall
promote the organization of departmental groups of major
students to conserve the system within the departments, shall
prepare a statement concerning the Honor System to be
printed in the freshmen handbook, and shall assume leader
ship in developing and strengthening student opinion and
responsibility with regard to the Honor System.
Second: That the following legislation be enacted:
1. Responsibility for honesty in examinations is hereby
placed upon the students of the University.
2. The instructor shall provide a room where the exami
nation may be held without crowding, or two sets of
questions may be used in alternate seats, or examinations in
two different courses may be given in the same room, the
students in different courses alternating. After the questions
have been presented and inquiries answered the instructor
shall withdraw from the room.
For the benefit of any who may be perplexed by the
emphasis which this action placed upon the responsibilities to
be assumed by upper division students, specifically by major
department, certain contemporary circumstances should be
noted.
First, during the preceding decade, every Stanford student
had been identified with some major department upon
matriculation. Secondly, the initial experiments with the
Honor System had been conducted within departments, each
one under the stimulus of the leadership of the students of
the department. Third, the scheme of general education
known as the Lower Division, which had been adopted in
1920, was in the process of being established in the spring of
1921.
Under the new program, students would not declare
majors until they had completed the Lower Division require
ments and had been admitted into the Upper Division. It was
assumed that the Upper Division students of a department
could and would assume the responsibilities heretofore
shouldered by the major students of the department.
In fact, however, many students did not complete their
Lower Division requirements until much later than the
beginning of the |unior year. In many departments, the group
officially recognized as Upper Division majors came to
represent a small proportion of the students taking courses in
the department.
Accordingly, the Upper Division students of a department
did not represent a viable unit for the exercise of collective
responsibility under the Honor System. In practice, there
fore, this function was performed primarily by campus-wide
student agencies.
Prior to that historic Council meeting in the spring of
1921, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that the
faculty would approve the proposed Honor System. There
were indications that even some who voted for the proposal
did so with the expectation that the experiment would fail,
and that in reasonably short order, the Council would be
called upon to withdraw the delegation of responsibility
which this action mandated.
The record of the Council debate which preceded the
action is revealing. It reads:
The president next presented the recommendation of the
Executive Committee adopted May 19th, 1921, providing for
a plan for student responsibility for honesty in examinations
Mr. Green for the Committee reported that: First, a
distinct movement had been made by a group of students to
arouse interest in the Student Body in an honor system;
Second, a student assembly had been held; third, a proposed
plan had been presented to the President; Fourth, the
recommendation as presented was the result of a conference
between a group of students and a subcommittee of the
Executive Committee
Mr. Green moved that the recommendation of the Execu
tive Committee be adopted by the Council.
A general discussion followed in which Dr. Meyer, Mr.
Whi taker, Mr A.B. Clark opposed the motion.
Mr. Whittier stated that under the Proctor system at
Harvard cheating was impossible and he felt certain that,
except the honor system, it was the only method that would

prove successful. Mr. Whittier favored giving the proposed
plan a trial.
Mr. Mitchell moved that paragraph two under the pro
posed legislation be amended to include after the word
"crowding," the following: "or two sets of questions may be
used in alternate seats."
On being put to vote, the amendment earned.
Mr. Cottrell moved to amend paragraph two under the
proposed legislation by adding the following to the amend
ment proposed by Mr. Mitchell: "or examinations in two
different courses may be given in the same room, the
students in different courses alternating."
On being put to vote, the amendment earned.
Mr. Moreno rno»ed that the regulation (second part of
paragraph two) requiring instructss to withdraw from the
room after the questions have been presented and inquiries
answered be omitted.
A brief discussion followed in which Mr. Adams, Mr.
Wildman and Mr. Swain opposed the amendment.
On being put to vote, the motion was lost.
Mr. Cottrell moved that the recommendation be amended
to include, "written reports"and "theses."
On being put to vote, the motion was lost.
It is worthy to note that this record was set down 55 years
ago.
Despite the anticipation on the part of many of the
faculty that the Honor System would fail, the momentum of
the students' seven-year effort to gain its acceptance by the
faculty was sufficient, not only to sustain it during its trial
period, but to establish it as a completely accepted tradition.
It was first confronted with the Honor Code when, as a
neophyte assistant professor, I gave my first examination in
the autumn of 1940. On the morning of the exam, I realized
with some shock that I did not know how I was expected to
behave. By that time, the Honor Code was taken very much
for granted and there was no orientation program for new
faculty members. I have no recollection now of how I got the
hang of it, but somehow I did.
During World War 11, the civilian enrollment at Stanford
dropped from a previous peak of 4,364 to below 2,500; and
there was a time when as many of 3,000 in uniform
(primarily men, but as many as 40 women) were studying on
the campus in government-sponsored programs, having been
assigned here by the Army.
There naturally arose the question of whether the stu
dents in these programs should be asked to subscribe to the
Honor Code. The decision was left to each class. The
obligations of the Honor Code were explained to each class,
although there was insufficient time and opportunity for the
kind of extensive and careful orientation which was then
regularly provided for new civilian students in connection
with preregistration.
Each class was asked to determine by vote whether
examinations should be given under the Honor System. Given
the diverse backgrounds of the individuals involved and the
absence of thorough orientation, it was not considered
surprising that most of the classes chose to have their
examinations proctored. Only a few of the smallest classes
chose to function under the Honor Code.
I have not discovered authentic records of how Men's
Council and Women's Council functioned during their first
years. It is clear, however, that student initiative was respon
sible for introducing the label. Honor Code, as a replacement
for Honor System. It was also responsible for the expansion
of the basic concept of the Honor Code from the original
limited notion of honesty in examinations to the broader
idea of honesty in all academic work.
This was accomplished, in part, through the efforts of
generations of students on the Honor Code Committee, each
attempting to redefine the Code in contemporary terms, and,
in part, through precedents set by decisions of Men's and
Women's Councils. By the '40s it was fully accepted that the
Honor Code applied to laboratory work and to papers as well
as to examinations. Plagiarism received major attention in the
'50s.
During the Wilbur Presidency, until 1943, the findings of
the Councils in all judicial cases were recommendations to
the President, who acted upon them personally. In 1945, the
Office of Dean of Students was established, and the President
delegated to the Dean most of the responsibilities he had
previously carried directly with respect to student conduct.
As Registrar in the Office of the Dean of Students from
1945 to 1950, I was intimately involved with preregistration
and orientation. In this connection, I had opportunity to
observe first-hand the serious efforts of students to maintain
the Honor Code and to promote its general health through
the education and indoctrination of new students. The term
"indoctrination" is not here used carelessly, for indoctrina
tion in the tenets of the Code was then regarded by the
leadeiship of the student body as entirely proper, and even
essential to the survival of the Code. It was considered
particularly important in view of the rapid expansion of
enrollment, which by the autumn of 1947 exceeded 8,000.
Beginning in 1950, as Dean of Students, I exercised the
responsibility, delegated by the President, of acting on
recommendations of Men's and Women's Councils, subject to
direct appeal to the President. In Honor Code cases the two
Councils sat together as the ASSU Judicial Council. In
Fundamental Standard cases, they usually sat separately as
Men's Council and Women's Council, respectively, although
occasionally when both men and women were involved in a
specific case, the two operated together as the ASSU Judicial
Council.
As dean, I also served as advisor to the ASSU Commission
on the Fundamental Standard, which was charged with
promoting and interpreting the Fundamental Standard, and
as advisor to the ASSU Commission on the Honor Code,
which had similar responsibilities with respect to the Honor
Code. Although at no time did I sit with the Councils during
the proceedings of a case, I met with the members on
occasion, at their request, to discuss policies and procedures;
and I was fully informed regarding these procedures.
When an alleged, or suspected. Honor Code violation was
reported, it was referred to the chairman of the Judicial
Council, along with whatever evidence had been submitted.
The Council was responsible for both the investigation and
the adjudication of the matter.
Cases were handled in informal hearings. There was no
prosecution, as such, and no hearing officer. The Council
could call witnesses, faculty or students, who were expected
to respond honestly and fully to any relevant questions
regarding the case, in so far as they had such information.
The prevailing attitude of students at the time was that
the Honor Code required honesty and openness in responding
to questions from a duly constituted body of one's peers,
even though it might involve self-incrimination. In fact,
students who, in moments of weakness made mistakes, in the
majority of cases, regarded it as the honorable thing to do to
admit their errors candidly when confronted with evidence of
them.
The relative homogeneity of the student body at that
time, no doubt, contributed significantly to the maintenance
of consensus in questions of this sort. It was also aided by the
fact that all cases were dealt with confidentially and suspects
could admit their mistakes, and take their penalties, with a
minimum risk of public exposure.
Members of Men's and Women's Councils were elected at
large from the student body. These positions were prestigi
ous, comparable in popular esteem to that of ASSU President
and Vice-President at that time, when the ASSU presidency
commanded considerably more prestige, in my opinion, than
it has in recent years. Positions on Men's and Women's
Councils were much more sought after than were positions
on the ASSU Ex Com (Executive Committee), predecessor to
LASSU (the Legislature of ASSU) and, later, to the ASSU
Senate.
In the early 19505, the ASSU Commissions on the
Fundamental Standard and the Honor Code, respectively,
took very seriously their responsibilities for the interpreta
tion and application of the Standard and the Code, and for
the education and indoctrination of students in matters
relating to them.
Year by year, there was, of course, fluctuation in the zeal
of these bodies. In a given year, for example, an all-out effort
would be made, leading to a judgment at some point that the
campus had become saturated with discussion of such
matters, and a period of relaxation would follow. But

regularly, in preregistration and orientation programs, maior
attention was given to the intent, the values, the applications
and procedures involved in the Honor Code and the Funda
mental Standard
Frequently, series of discussions were held in residences,
especially freshmen residences with sponsors taking leader
ship, but also in upper-class houses. Faculty members often
participated in these discussions, particularly those involving
the Honor Code. These programs represented continuous
efforts to reinterpret and redefine the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code in terms of contemporary relevance.
During this period, students generally expressed great
pride in their identification with Stanford, and pride in the
Honor Code contributed significantly to institutional morale.
On the other hand, it was not generally assumed that
Stanford students were natively any more honest than others,
nor that the act of matriculating at Stanford automatically
equipped an individual to suppress self-interest in any situa
tion which presented the student with a conflict between
self-interest and the expectations of the Honor Code.
In short, it was not assumed that the Code would work
automatically, but rather that it was a cultivated taste. It was
thought that most individuals had to learn to appreciate the
full values of living and working under the freedom of the
Honor Code, and in the atmosphere of mutual trust which it
engendered.
The nature of group responsibility, including what was
referred to as "third-person responsibility," was a perennial
question. The expectation that a student would "turn in" a
suspected violator was frequently troublesome. But in keep
ing with the 1921 action of the Academic Council, the
Commission on the Honor Code held that the primary group
responsibility was to create an environment which encour
aged honesty and discouraged dishonesty.
The second level of responsibility was to prevent specific
acts of dishonesty by intervention, when the occasion pre
sented itself. It was observed that a student could often sense
"an accident about to happen" and, by taking appropriate
and timely initiative, prevent it. In this connection, there was
talk in the '50s of trying to revive an earlier practice involving
pencil tapping as a warning to those whose eyes appeared to
be straying unduly.
The next level of group responsibility, in case the viola
tion actually occurred, was to attempt to persuade the
suspect to turn himself in. The turning in of a suspected
violator by a "third person" was regarded as a last resort,
when all else failed.
The two commissions were also responsible for the publi
cation of a pamphlet on the Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code, which was circulated to all new students. There
were lengthy discussions on the content of this booklet. In
this connection, a major issue arose on the question of the
right of the student to take his examination out of the
classroom. Gradually it had come to be assumed, in some
quarters, that every student had such a right under the Honor
Code.
The practice became so general that there developed a
concern that the opportunity for the exercise of group
responsibility was being weakened, and that public confi
dence in the integrity of the Honor Code was being under
mined thereby.
Finally in 1955, after a couple of years of wrestling with
the problem, the Honor Code Commission persuaded the
ASSU Executive Committee to adopt a provision that,
provided alternate seats were available, examinations might
be taken from the examination room, only with the prior
consent of the instructor. It was then understood that, under
the 1921 action of the Academic Council, the Ex Com had
the authority to make such a determination, but since it
represented the exercise of a delegated authority, it was
reported officially to the Academic Council on April 1, 1955.
The Ex Com action was also ratified by the student body in a
referendum.
The Honor Code Commission was generally confident
that it possessed the means to maintain adequate awareness,
on the part of students, of their obligations under the Honor
Code. However, it was less sure of means to maintain
awareness, on the part of the faculty, of their obligations, as
provided in the 1921 action.
On the one hand, there were apprehensions that a few
faculty members were invading student prerogatives in
matters involving honesty in academic work. On the other
hand, there were greater apprehensions that more faculty
members were too passive with respect to the Honor Code
and were failing to provide the "encouragement and coopera
tion" hoped for in 1921.
On the Commission's initiative, arrangements were made
for the President's Office to send a copy of the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code pamphlet to all new faculty
members with their letters of appointment. Also, on its
intiative, in 1954, the expectation of faculty cooperation was
incorporated in the ASSU By-Law on the Honor Code. This
action was officially approved by the Executive Committee
of the Academic Council (predecessor to the Senate of the
Academic Council) in an action which is recorded in Execu
tive Committee Minutes for June 9, 1954 as follows:
The Academic Secretary also reported that the Executive
Committee of ASSU sought the approval of the faculty upon
an addition to Section 2 of Article 1 of the ASSU By-Laws.
The complete Section 2, with the recommended edition
underlined, reads as follows:
Section 2: The Honor Code.
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students,
individually and collectively:
1. That they will do their share and take an active
part in seeing to it that others as well as themselves
uphold the spirit and the letter of the Honor Code.
2. That they will not give or receive aid in examina
tions; that they will not give nor receive unper
mitted aid in class work; in the preparation of
reports, or in any other work that is to be used by
the instructor as the basis of grading.
B. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the
honor of its students by refraining from proctor ing
examinations, or otherwise taking special steps to
prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above.
C. The students and the faculty will work together to
establish those conditions under which optimum acad
emic performance can be achieved.
Dean l/Vinbigler explained that, although a specif*! student
committee had done a great amount of work during the year
on the instrumentation of the Honor Code, the work of this
committee had not been completed and would be continued
in full force during the academic year, 1954-55. The recom
mended changes were sought as a means of emphasizing
cooperation between faculty members and students in the
maintenance of the Code. The Executive Committee un
animously approved the recommended revision of the sec
tion.
With but one additional amendment to incorporate the
1955 revision regarding the taking of examinations from the
classroom, the foregoing statement stands today as the
official regulation of the Honor Code.
In 1955-56, it occurred to students that the Fundamental
Standard was an all-embracing concept and that the Honor
Code should be regarded as an application of the Fundament
al Standard to academic work. As a practical matter, the
Fundamental Standard Commission had experienced some
difficulty in identifying meaningful agenda, and the two
Commissions were combined as a single body, known as the
Fundamental Standard Commission. That year, the chairman
of the Commission was a graduate student in education, and
representatives of the faculty and staff were invited to sit
with the Commission.
It now appears ironic that 1955 was the year that the
ASSU Legislature replaced the old Ex Com. In retrospect, it
is clear that the birth of LASSU marked the beginning of an
adversarial relationship between the legislative and executive
branches of ASSU which contributed significantly to a
reduction in the capacity of ASSU to represent the student
body with a united and authoritative voice. Gradually, the
adversarial spirit, which was first generated between the
executive and legislative branches, affected relationships
between the ASSU and the faculty and officers of the
University.
By the early '60s, a combination of this adversarial spirit.
