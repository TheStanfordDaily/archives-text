A New World Record

Rtttviewftd by 81l Wernecke
The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), which vis
its the Cow Palace tonight, has finally achieved
widespread commercial success. On A New
World Record, however, the group fails to match
their best efforts—due not to commercialism, but
rather to the group's own limitations.
The album does display some of ELO's best
features in spectacular fashion. The string ar
rangements which have become the group's
trademark provide strong support without intrud
ing or becoming trite. The trio of Kaminski,
McDowell and Gale plays with a gusto and preci
sion that is admirable.
The album's opening cut, "Tightrope", is a
good example of ELO's mastery of the strings both
in the introduction and choruses of a song. The
introductory arrangement is repeated at album's
end in "Shangri-la", which ties the work together
quite effectively.
Hook lines
Another high point on "Record" is the strength
of ELO's hook lines and choruses. As on their past
hits, "Evil Woman" and "Strange Magic", a single
phrase is repeated with a varying instrumental
background, with an effect that is often hard to
forget.
The rocker "Do Ya", a song taken from the
group's first incarnation as The Move, carries this

effect off well. "So Fine" and "Livin'Thing" open
up side two in the same manner.
Despite these strong points, though, thegroup's
inability to avoid their weaknesses on Record
makes it a lesser album than their Face the Music
of a year ago. Writer, arranger and lead vocalist
Jeff Lynne appears to be running low on creativ
ity; his string arrangements and hook lines fail to
compensate for the rest of the album.
Poor lead vocals
Lynne's lead vocals have always been poor, and
his increased use of an echo technique and back
ing female vocals do not help matters. With its
sappy words and string arrangements, along with
Lynne's vocals, "Telephone Line" sounds like the
early Bee Gees.
Another fault is Lynne's inability to write ver
ses with the same skill as his hook lines. The cuts
"Tightrope", "So Fine", and "Livin' Thing" all
meander through their verses until they reach
their hooks. "Above the Clouds", which lacks the
hook line, never seems to get off the ground.
Lynne does strike some successful notes. In
much the same style as "Roll Over Beethoven",
the cut "Rockaria" displays Lynne's affinity for
Chuck Berry's brand of rock-and-roll. The combi
nation of a cutting lead guitar and a clever bridge
carry "Do Ya" very nicely.
A New World Record is not a bad album, just
disappointing. ELO fans will probably enjoy it;
but for the uninitiated, I wouldn't recommend
taking a chance.

ity; his string arrangements and hook lines fail to
compensate for the rest of the album.
Poor lead vocals
Lynne's lead vocals have always been poor, and
his increased use of an echo technique and back
ing female vocals do not help matters. With its
sappy words and string arrangements, along with
Lynne's vocals, "Telephone Line" sounds like the
early Bee Gees.
Another fault is Lynne's inability to write ver
ses with the same skill as his hook lines. The cuts
"Tightrope", "So Fine", and "Livin' Thing" all
meander through their verses until they reach
their hooks. "Above the Clouds", which lacks the
hook line, never seems to get off the ground.
Lynne does strike some successful notes. In
much the same style as "Roll Over Beethoven",
the cut "Rockaria" displays Lynne's affinity for
Chuck Berry's brand of rock-and-roll. The combi
nation of a cutting lead guitar and a clever bridge
carry "Do Ya" very nicely.
A New World Record is not a bad album, just
disappointing. ELO fans will probably enjoy it;
but for the uninitiated, I wouldn't recommend
taking a chance.

The Electric Light Orchestra tonight
The Electric Light Orchestra will be appearing tonight at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. Their
latest album, A New World Record, has proved to be a disappointment.

The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), which vis
its the Cow Palace tonight, has finally achieved
widespread commercial success. On A New
World Record, however, the group fails to match
their best efforts—due not to commercialism, but
rather to the group's own limitations.
The album does display some of ELO's best
features in spectacular fashion. The string ar
rangements which have become the group's
trademark provide strong support without intrud
ing or becoming trite. The trio of Kaminski,
McDowell and Gale plays with a gusto and preci
sion that is admirable.
The album's opening cut, "Tightrope", is a
good example of ELO's mastery of the strings both
in the introduction and choruses of a song. The
introductory arrangement is repeated at album's
end in "Shangri-la", which ties the work together
quite effectively.
Hook lines
Another high point on "Record" is the strength
of ELO's hook lines and choruses. As on their past
hits, "Evil Woman" and "Strange Magic", a single
phrase is repeated with a varying instrumental
background, with an effect that is often hard to
forget.
The rocker "Do Ya", a song taken from the
group's first incarnation as The Move, carries this

effect off well. "So Fine" and "Livin'Thing" open
up side two in the same manner.
Despite these strong points, though, thegroup's
inability to avoid their weaknesses on Record
makes it a lesser album than their Face the Music
of a year ago. Writer, arranger and lead vocalist
Jeff Lynne appears to be running low on creativ
ity; his string arrangements and hook lines fail to
compensate for the rest of the album.

Lynne's lead vocals have always been poor, and
his increased use of an echo technique and back
