# A 						people's pianist....
## Oscar captures crowd 
### David L. Miller 
If you dig jazz, you ALREADY love Oscar Peter
son.
You know what to expect when you hear him:
virtuosity, unbelievably fast runs, constantly
changing rhythms with frequent double times,
huge ten-finger chords, dignity, a little boogie
woogie. arid an unsurpassable emotional inten
sity.
Peterson's technical skill is a step above every
body else in the business. He has three hands.
Yet, he's a traditionalist, a people's pianist.
Peterson draws people of all ages. Everybody can
understand his musical ideas and groove to them.
He plays old favorites.
Evoking nostalgic memories of those good old
times, Peterson opened Sunday night at Ber
keley's Zellerbach Auditorium playing Old Folks
and Indiana.
Groaning almost painfully at each song's
climax, Pelerson irretrievably captured the audi
ence from the first note. He received many stand
ing ovations in addition to loud, long hooting
applauses.
Classical discipline
Peterson played with the discipline of a classi
cal concert pianist steeped in the blues. Hisarticu
lations were crystal. His rhythms danced insideof
you. The combination worked perfectly.
Peterson's techique was acrobatic, but never ar
rogant. His lightning improvisations were al
ways meaningful, often restrained and melodic.
His sensitive rendition of Body and Soul (made
famous by Billie Holiday, with whom Peterson
played) filled the auditorium with a wailing gos
pel blues, and ended with a short, abstract state
ment of Play Misty For Me.

Unquestionably, the evening's highpoint was a
long Ellington medley just before intermission.
Playing Take the A Train, Got It Bad and That
Ain't Good, Caravan, Satin Doil,C-/am Blues, and
Mood Indigo, Peterson exhibited innumerable
rhythmic complexities, tremendous dynamic
control, and genius.
Left-handed boogie woogie
During the second half, Peterson launched
through Who Can 1 Turn To, and Reunion Blues,
bringing the audience to its feet with left-handed
boogie woogie bass lines and sharp plucking con
versational phrasings.
Using 88 ivory keys, Peterson creates an or
chestra of sound. He moans and sweats and rocks
back and forth. Continually spinning variations of
themes, he extends climaxes with growing swirl
ing chords, fast parallel two-handed runs, con
trasting soft sections leading to even more power
ful climaxes.
In a single piece, Peterson will catch you, build
you up to a peak, play slowly faster than anyone
you've ever heard, fly you through musical roller
coasters, flow from phase to phase to phase, re
state four or five themes and ten or 20 rhythms,
bring you down gently and then haul the piece in
and by god you're still there!
Peterson was born in Montreal 51 years ago and
has been a lifetime resident of Canada. Known
primarily as a trio musician, he has been perform
ing solo concerts since he joined Norman Branz's
Pablo jazz label four years ago. His last Bay Area
performance was in April, with Ella Fitzgerald,
Count Basie, and Joe Pass.
Peterson is the first in a U.C. Berkeley series of
solo pianists. Eubie Blake and Earl "Fatha" Hines
appear Friday at 8 p.m. inZellerbach Auditorium.

If you dig jazz, you ALREADY love Oscar Peter
son.
You know what to expect when you hear him:
virtuosity, unbelievably fast runs, constantly
changing rhythms with frequent double times,
huge ten-finger chords, dignity, a little boogie
woogie. arid an unsurpassable emotional inten
sity.
Peterson's technical skill is a step above every
body else in the business. He has three hands.
Yet, he's a traditionalist, a people's pianist.
Peterson draws people of all ages. Everybody can
understand his musical ideas and groove to them.
He plays old favorites.
Evoking nostalgic memories of those good old
times, Peterson opened Sunday night at Ber
keley's Zellerbach Auditorium playing Old Folks
and Indiana.
Groaning almost painfully at each song's
climax, Pelerson irretrievably captured the audi
ence from the first note. He received many stand
ing ovations in addition to loud, long hooting
applauses.
Classical discipline
Peterson played with the discipline of a classi
cal concert pianist steeped in the blues. Hisarticu
lations were crystal. His rhythms danced insideof
you. The combination worked perfectly.
Peterson's techique was acrobatic, but never ar
rogant. His lightning improvisations were al
ways meaningful, often restrained and melodic.
His sensitive rendition of Body and Soul (made
famous by Billie Holiday, with whom Peterson
played) filled the auditorium with a wailing gos
pel blues, and ended with a short, abstract state
ment of Play Misty For Me.

Unquestionably, the evening's highpoint was a
long Ellington medley just before intermission.
Playing Take the A Train, Got It Bad and That
Ain't Good, Caravan, Satin Doil,C-/am Blues, and
Mood Indigo, Peterson exhibited innumerable
rhythmic complexities, tremendous dynamic
control, and genius.
Left-handed boogie woogie
During the second half, Peterson launched
through Who Can 1 Turn To, and Reunion Blues,
bringing the audience to its feet with left-handed
boogie woogie bass lines and sharp plucking con
versational phrasings.
Using 88 ivory keys, Peterson creates an or
chestra of sound. He moans and sweats and rocks
back and forth. Continually spinning variations of
themes, he extends climaxes with growing swirl
ing chords, fast parallel two-handed runs, con
trasting soft sections leading to even more power
ful climaxes.
In a single piece, Peterson will catch you, build
you up to a peak, play slowly faster than anyone
you've ever heard, fly you through musical roller
coasters, flow from phase to phase to phase, re
state four or five themes and ten or 20 rhythms,
bring you down gently and then haul the piece in
and by god you're still there!
Peterson was born in Montreal 51 years ago and
has been a lifetime resident of Canada. Known
primarily as a trio musician, he has been perform
ing solo concerts since he joined Norman Branz's
Pablo jazz label four years ago. His last Bay Area
performance was in April, with Ella Fitzgerald,
Count Basie, and Joe Pass.
Peterson is the first in a U.C. Berkeley series of
solo pianists. Eubie Blake and Earl "Fatha" Hines
appear Friday at 8 p.m. inZellerbach Auditorium.
