Luxury Liner
Emmylou Harris
Warner Bros.
Reviewed by 81l Lartans
Although Emmylou Harris
will probably never divorce her
self from the music and influ
ence of the late Gram Parsons,
with Luxury Liner, her third
major solo album, she further es
tablishes herself as a singer in
her own right, a sensitive in
terpreter of country and country
pop &uugS.
Born in Alabama, Harris was a
highly motivated drama student
at the University of North
Carolina until she began to take
music seriously. Discovered in a
Washington, D.C. club by the
Flying Burrito Brothers in 1971,
Harris was coaxed out to
California by the Burritos' foun
der, Gram Parsons.
Emmylou and Gram formed a
musical partnership lasting just
two albums. Parsons died in
1973. He had envisioned bring
ing country music to large audi
ences through what he liked to
call "contemporary musics." It
is ironic that his pupil, Emmylou
Harris, is winning far more ac
ceptance for the country idiom
than Parsons did.
Following the successful Elite
Hotel album, which included
the chart-topping, heart-rending
"Sweet Dreams," Luxury Liner
continues the Harris homage to
Parsons.
Search for love
The title cut is a Parsons song
about a forlorn soul conduction a
mobile search for love. Jumping
and restless, spiced up with
scalding peddle steel guitar, it
recalls Parsons' "Las Vegas,"
which Harris recorded both with
Gram and on "Elite Hotel."
The other Parsons composi
tion on Luxury Liner could well
have been written about Em
mylou. "She" looks to the youth

of a hard-working southern girl
whose life's energy was con
sumed by song.
Emmylou has often been com
pared with Linda Ronstadt, on
whose recordings she has sung.
Two major differences should be
noted. For the most part.
Ronstadt sings what they think
of as country music in L A. Har
ris sticks closer to the real thing.
On Luxury Liner Harris reaches
back to 1938 with the mournful
"Hello Stranger," a song about
two parties parted by the incarc
eration of one. Even Chuck Ber
ry's "You Never Can Tell" is
treated with enough peddle steel
and cajun fiddle to be a success
ful vehicle for bright
country tones.
Fragile and tender
The other difference between
Ronstadt and Harris is stylistic.
Ronstadt belts out syllables with
fierce intensity, and she has the
lungs to do it. Harris, whose
voice is thinner, understates her
songs. Consequently, she
sounds more fragile and evokes
more tenderness.
The highlight of Luxury Liner
is the cynical, disillusioned
"You're Supposed to be Feeling
Good." Harris tantalizes by al
most, but not quite, singing her
heart out, as if fully giving
would entail enduring more
hurt.
The album is characterized by
restraint. This quality, under
scored by judicious production
by Brian Ahern, should endear
Emmylou to a new, larger fol
lowing. By the way, the lyrics are
included but they are rendered
unnecessary by Harris' clarity
and expressiveness.
Should Emmylou Harris
achieve greater commercial suc
cess with Luxury Liner, she de
serves it. Check her out next Fri
day at Mem Aud. I'm sure you'll
agree.

Wings Over America
Paul McCartney and Wings
Capitol
Renewed by 81l Larkins
Paul McCartney's "eclecti
cism," as one might call his ex
perimentation with different
sounds, has earned him as many
detractors as admirers. From the
Rudy Vallee levity of the 20s
("You Cave Me the Answer"), to
feathery felicity ("Bluebird"), to
crass Hollywood commer
cialism ("Live and Let Die"),
Wings Over America covers all
of Paul's styles and phases, with
appropriate acknowledgement
of his career as a Beatle.
A three-record set recorded
during Wings' tour of North
America last summer, Over
America is not a "live" album as
perfected by Frampton, with
requisite roais of delight from
obediantly respondent masses.
Instead McCartney has all but
ignored the crowd noises and
the tedious "Do You Feel Al
right?" chants. As a result, the
album comes off as a sampler of
unconnected great and inconse
quential efforts.
Brought to us in an ugly grey
representation of a jet fuselage,
Wings Over America might more
accurately be titled Paul Over
America. As the album's pro
ducer, Paul foregoes no oppor
tunity to remind us who sings
lead vocals and plays bass in his
band.
Drowned out
Paul's pounding bass domi
nates otherwise fine versions of
"Listen to What the Man Said,"
"Silly Love Songs," and virtu
ally all of the album's rockers,
such as "Rock Show," "Magneto
and Titanium Man," and "Hi,
Hi, Hi." On the latter cut, fiery
slide guitar work by Denny
Laine is simply drowned out.
Similarly, Laine's clever piano
on "Lady Madonna" is barely
audible.
McCartney wisely relegates

his charming spouse Linda, who
plays keyboards and sings, to a
back-up role. Linda's talents are
stretched to their limit by less
than imaginative, indeed bland,
harmony on "I've Just Seen a
Face."
Most welcome and refreshing
are spare, uncluttered renditions
of the sentimental "My Love"
and "Long and Winding Road."
Missing are the lush. i.e. pon
derous, studio strings that mar
red the originals, and the results
are two of this album's most
satisfying cuts.
Sincere vocal
On "Maybe I'm Amazed," one
of McCartney's best loved songs,
Paul delivers a strong, sincere
vocal, which is precisely what
we don't hear on the more trite
material ("Picasso's Last
Words," "Let 'em It," etc.).
Over America could have
been a tasteful double album. As
it stands, McCartney's choice of
material defies explanation. On
the primarily acoustic third side
he gives us the highly unlikely,
folksy "Richard Cory" by Paul
Simon. "Let Me Roll It," while a
good parody of John Lennon, has
no place on a "live" album. It's
boring.
Conspicuously missing from
this uneven collection are
"Junior's Farm" and "Let it Be."
A four man horn section ac
companied Wings throughout
their American tour, but simple
arangements and undermixing
indicate that the horns were to
McCartney merely an after
thought. Which leads one to ask
how much thought did go into
this album? McCartney's con
firmed admirers will probably
adore "Over America;" his
critics will undoubtedly find
new and extensive evidence of
McCartney's slide into the
quagmire of trite commer
cialism.
