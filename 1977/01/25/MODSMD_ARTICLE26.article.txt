# Skilled violist plays unentertaining music

### Glenn Weadock 
Violist Marcus Thompson's recital in Kresge
Auditorium last Friday evening was the second in
the series of performances presented this winter
by The Lively Arts at Stanford. The music was
largely contemporary and non-melodic; one of the
pieces included a computerized electronic ac
companiment to the solo viola. But Thompson, a
30-year-old humanities professor at MIT with a
doctorate from the Julliard School of Music,
played with force and dignity, and demonstrated
a high level of technical ability.
The first piece on the program was the three
movement Sonata for Viola and Piano in G Minor
by Felix Mendelssohn. The Allegro proved
Thompson's ability to play rapid running pas
sages with precise, percussive fingers. The dark
colored Menuetto, with an attractive, slow middle
section, was played well with the exception of
some rough note attacks, but the Andante con
Variazioni, which lasted for an unusually long
time, had some problems: occasional swelled
notes, the bow skipping across the string and not
really digging in during fortissimo passages, and
(strangely) no vibrato on many notes.
However, the finish, replete with bouncing bow
and arpeggio effects, came off very strongly. Ac
companying pianist Seth Carlin, did a marvelous
job throughout the evening; Mendelssohn gave
some of the most interesting and beautiful music
to the piano, and Carlin played with fine style.
West Coast premiere?
The second piece, a viola sonata by the Russian
Dmitri Shostakovitch, was written in 1975 and
had probably never been heard on the West Coast
before: no American edition exists yet, and
Thompson played from a West German edition.
The sonata is in three movements; the first,
Moderato, begins with a humorous pizzicato
motif which reappears in various forms through
out the movement. The humor soon disappears,
however, and the rest of the movement is dis
jointed, nonmelodic rambling with predictable
alternations of loud and soft passages.
The Allegretto is technically very difficult and
rhythmically intriguing, and ends "up in the air"

to be followed immediately by the Adagio. This
last movement, based on a four-note theme, wore
out its welcome long before its unimpressive
finish.
Viola-computer duet
Another contemporary work, by Barry Vercoe
of MIT, was entitled Synapse for Viola and Com
puter, and involved an electronic "orchestra"
(two speakers on stage) which provided
Thompson's accompaniment. The piece (which
was written for Thompson) employed many elec
tronic effects and notes at extreme ends of the
audible range; there was one hilarious ten-second
dialogue between the viola and a viola-like com
puter sound, but the rest of the piece was simply
an unnatural string of sounds which conveyed no
musical meaning.
The last piece, Paul Hindemith's Sonata Op. 11
No. 4, is just not attractive music. There isn't
much dynamic contrast, there is a great deal of
rhythmic repetition, and the work has few discer
nible themes. The audience responded enthusias
tically, though, giving Thompson four curtain
calls, after which he and Carlin played an air from
a Bach cantata as an encore.
Overall, Thompson played very well; he man
aged difficult pizzicato and bouncing bow pas
sages with skill, and drew a fine, full sound from
his 200-year-old instrument. However, he lacked
the final degrees of finesse that distinguish the
virtuoso from the very competent musician.
Sometimes the notes were not quite in tune, the
vibrato was overly wide (particularly in the Bach),
and the bow didn't always "catch" the string at
first in loud passages.
A viola recital is an interesting and unusual
event, and it was unfortunate that less than 30
Stanford students attended; however, the music
on the program was not entertaining, pleasing, or
musically satisfying (the exceptions being a
David Amram piece and the Bach encore), and no
amount of technical ability or enthusiastic play
ing could make it so. The music Thompson
played bore no relation to nature and was blank of
emotional content; the works were therefore col
lections of musical notes, not pieces of music.
