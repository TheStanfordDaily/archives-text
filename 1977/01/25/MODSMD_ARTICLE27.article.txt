(Second of two parts; in case you missed
Part I in last Thursday's Daily', v/s're
visiting the set of that enormously suc
cessful tragi-comic television show,
M*A*S*H")
Alan Alda as Hawkeye reflects on the
enemy: "I don't know why they're shoot
ing at us. All we want to do is bring them
democracy and white bread. Transplant
the American Dream. Freedom,
achievement, hyperacidity. Affluence,
flatulence, technology, tension. The ina
lienable right to an early coronary sitting
at your desk while plotting to stab your
boss in the back. Now that's entertain
ment!"
As an ardent feminist and head of Men
for ERA, M*A*S*H star Alan Alda has
appeared on Issues fr Answers and the
Democratic Telethon to speak for the
Equal Rights Amendment ("Equality of
rights under law shall not be denied or
abridged by the U.S. or by any state on
account of sex.") Alda's segment of
"ABC Closeup on the ERA" aired Satur
day and the amendment itself will soon
come up to vote in some of the 15 holdout
states, three of which are needed by
Spring '79 for the ERA to become part of
the Constitution.
Alda comments that the anti-ERA
people are "Afraid of the responsibility
of freedom" and that sadly in some cases
this fear has led to lies. Alda believes that
even if the ERA does not pass, everybody
(including the anti's) will have benefit
ted from the debate and subsequent laws
passed.
Chess whiz Mike Farrell (8.J.) and I
talked politics a bit, but the election re
sults now make the matter academic.
Suffice to say he liked Stanford grad
David Harris.
Interesting people
Other people of interest on the set:
guest star Soon-Teck Oh (Pacific Over
tures star and former director of L.A.'s

East-West Players) believes that while
times are getting better for Asian actors,
there's still a long way to go. Leland, an
ex*n» is working on improving Asian
status ii» the Screen Actors Guild.
Another fellow ». nned Mello claims he
has the blood of an A s ;t*rius gorilla and
please, don't ask. '
Kelly Nakahara (Nurse Kelley,
Gary Burghoff (Radar) for his advice con
cerning her sick cat. Burghoff, who plays
a mean jazz piano, is resident animal doc
and his Malibu home is a refuge for
wayward birds.
Burghoff related a touching story
about a quail that flew into the large glass
window of his home and was knocked
unconscious. He rushed to its aid, pres
sed its little lungs and did everything
short of mouth-to-beak resuscitation to
revive the poor creature, but alas, the
quail was no more. So the valiant Mr.
Burghoff took it inside, plucked it,
cooked it, ate it, and (I quote) "It was
delicious."When asked how he could do
such a thing he replied, "Ecology."
Good ingredients
Bill Christopher (Father Mulcahy),
who played Joplin rag during the lunch
break, turned out to be pleasantly talka
tive, and we discussed the ingredients
that make M*A*S*H so good. He de
scribes his own character as "gentle, ef
fective in spite of himself" and espe
cially enjoys Mulcahy's wry sense of
humor: "I once worked my way through
school as a B-girl (hooker) in San Diego,"
he said.
But the Father may delineate another
extreme in the scope of M*A*S*H. For
example, from Gelbart's Humanities
Award-winning "The Interview"
episode, Mulcahy intones, "When the
doctors cut into a patient, and it's cold,
you know, the way it is now today, steam
rises from the body...And the doctor will
warm himself over the open wound.
Could anyone look on that and not feel

changed?"
A scene is filmed in which wounded
soldiers in torn clothing and bloody
bandages moan in pain as they are car
ried by stretcher from the hospital bus.
The scene is over, the soldiers rise and
become extras, instantly insensitive to
and unaffected by their grotesque ap
pearance. They chat, laugh, and join in a
fcctme of gin rummy.
It is an eeil? ••'rnngely disturbing and
almost obscene scene, ana yoi il
represent another harsh reality of
M*A*S*H, the callous and casual man
ner in which we treat the outrageous in
sult of the horror that is war. M*A*S*H
pokes us in the conscience and strives to
maintain contact with the human ele
ment. It is a bitter indictment against war
and a mad hope for the survival of hu
manity.
The humor of JVf*A*S*H consists of
sublime biting satire and flashy farce. It
is subtle through understatement,
natural, realistic, wise and often
desperate—but only in the sense that
here are people reaching out to hold orrto
some semblance of sanity through laugh
ter. M*A*S*H is humanity crying out,
winning at times but often losing, e.g. the
death of Col. Blake.
Take all that and combine it with the
excellent writing, talented cast, splendid
direction, slick one-camera photo
graphy, and snappy editing that lets
M*A*S*H say in a sentence what most
TV shows say in a scene. Add the overall
intelligence, integrity, charm, and sharp
social commentand you have M*A *S*H.
At the end of the day I succeeded in
flash bulb dazing Alda before he rushed
off to be late for an appointment. It's been
said that television is all business and
that may be true, but after my visit I can
not help feeling that, in M*A*S*H at
least, there does exist a certain—pardon
the cliche —magic, its origin uncertain,
but definitely present and accounted for.

Burghoff related a touching story
about a quail that flew into the large glass
window of his home and was knocked
unconscious. He rushed to its aid, pres

short of mouth-to-beak resuscitation to
revive the poor creature, but alas, the

Bill Christopher (Father Mulcahy),
who played Joplin rag during the lunch
break, turned out to be pleasantly talka
tive, and we discussed the ingredients
that make M*A*S*H so good. He de
scribes his own character as "gentle, ef
fective in spite of himself" and espe
cially enjoys Mulcahy's wry sense of
humor: "I once worked my way through
school as a B-girl (hooker) in San Diego,"
he said.
But the Father may delineate another
extreme in the scope of M*A*S*H. For
example, from Gelbart's Humanities
Award-winning "The Interview"
episode, Mulcahy intones, "When the
doctors cut into a patient, and it's cold,
you know, the way it is now today, steam
rises from the body...And the doctor will
warm himself over the open wound.
Could anyone look on that and not feel

changed?"
A scene is filmed in which wounded
soldiers in torn clothing and bloody
bandages moan in pain as they are car
ried by stretcher from the hospital bus.
The scene is over, the soldiers rise and
become extras, instantly insensitive to
and unaffected by their grotesque ap
pearance. They chat, laugh, and join in a
fcctme of gin rummy.
It is an eeil? ••'rnngely disturbing and
almost obscene scene, ana yoi il
represent another harsh reality of
M*A*S*H, the callous and casual man
ner in which we treat the outrageous in
sult of the horror that is war. M*A*S*H
pokes us in the conscience and strives to
maintain contact with the human ele
ment. It is a bitter indictment against war
and a mad hope for the survival of hu
manity.
The humor of JVf*A*S*H consists of
sublime biting satire and flashy farce. It
is subtle through understatement,
natural, realistic, wise and often
desperate—but only in the sense that
here are people reaching out to hold orrto
some semblance of sanity through laugh
ter. M*A*S*H is humanity crying out,
winning at times but often losing, e.g. the
death of Col. Blake.
Take all that and combine it with the
excellent writing, talented cast, splendid
direction, slick one-camera photo
graphy, and snappy editing that lets
M*A*S*H say in a sentence what most
TV shows say in a scene. Add the overall
intelligence, integrity, charm, and sharp
social commentand you have M*A *S*H.

A scene is filmed in which wounded
soldiers in torn clothing and bloody
bandages moan in pain as they are car

The scene is over, the soldiers rise and

M*A*S*H, the callous and casual man

pokes us in the conscience and strives to
maintain contact with the human ele

and a mad hope for the survival of hu
manity.
The humor of JVf*A*S*H consists of
sublime biting satire and flashy farce. It
is subtle through understatement,
natural, realistic, wise and often
desperate—but only in the sense that
here are people reaching out to hold orrto
some semblance of sanity through laugh
ter. M*A*S*H is humanity crying out,
winning at times but often losing, e.g. the
death of Col. Blake.
Take all that and combine it with the
excellent writing, talented cast, splendid
direction, slick one-camera photo
graphy, and snappy editing that lets
M*A*S*H say in a sentence what most
TV shows say in a scene. Add the overall
intelligence, integrity, charm, and sharp
social commentand you have M*A *S*H.
At the end of the day I succeeded in
flash bulb dazing Alda before he rushed

the cliche —magic, its origin uncertain,
but definitely present and accounted for.

Alan Alda as Hawkeye reflects on the
enemy: "I don't know why they're shoot
ing at us. All we want to do is bring them
democracy and white bread. Transplant
the American Dream. Freedom,
achievement, hyperacidity. Affluence,
flatulence, technology, tension. The ina
lienable right to an early coronary sitting

As an ardent feminist and head of Men
for ERA, M*A*S*H star Alan Alda has
appeared on Issues fr Answers and the
Democratic Telethon to speak for the
Equal Rights Amendment ("Equality of
rights under law shall not be denied or
abridged by the U.S. or by any state on
account of sex.") Alda's segment of
"ABC Closeup on the ERA" aired Satur
day and the amendment itself will soon
come up to vote in some of the 15 holdout
states, three of which are needed by
Spring '79 for the ERA to become part of
the Constitution.
Alda comments that the anti-ERA
people are "Afraid of the responsibility
of freedom" and that sadly in some cases
this fear has led to lies. Alda believes that
even if the ERA does not pass, everybody
(including the anti's) will have benefit

Burghoff related a touching story
about a quail that flew into the large glass
window of his home and was knocked
unconscious. He rushed to its aid, pres
sed its little lungs and did everything
short of mouth-to-beak resuscitation to
revive the poor creature, but alas, the
quail was no more. So the valiant Mr.
Burghoff took it inside, plucked it,
cooked it, ate it, and (I quote) "It was
delicious."When asked how he could do
such a thing he replied, "Ecology."
Good ingredients
Bill Christopher (Father Mulcahy),
who played Joplin rag during the lunch
break, turned out to be pleasantly talka

that make M*A*S*H so good. He de
scribes his own character as "gentle, ef
fective in spite of himself" and espe
cially enjoys Mulcahy's wry sense of
humor: "I once worked my way through
school as a B-girl (hooker) in San Diego,"
he said.
But the Father may delineate another
extreme in the scope of M*A*S*H. For
example, from Gelbart's Humanities
Award-winning "The Interview"
