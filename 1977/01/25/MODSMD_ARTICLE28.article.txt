Loan 'strengthens' British reserves
London — Britain received another massive in
ternational loan yesterday to bolster its reserves ot
foreign currency. The move immediately
strengthened the pound.
The $1.5 billion loan was made by a group of
major North American, German and British banks.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey told the
House of Commons. He added it would provide
important medium-term strength to the nation's
currency reserves.
Healey described the terms of the loan as "the
best that have been achieved in the market lo* a
comparable operation" since the government b" r
rowed $2.5 billion from an international banking
group in May 1974. Observers said the terms were
about the finest available, indicating growing op
timism for Britain's economic outlook.
The Bank of England said the new loan would be
drawn in two installments, one of $1 billion in the
near future, and the balance six months later.
Yesterday's move follows the announcement ear
lier this month of a $3.9 billion International
Monetary Fund (IMF) loan and agreement by West
ern bankers for a $3 billion "safety net" credit to
stabilize Britain's official sterling reserves, whose
volatility has been a major cause of the pound's
weakness.
After the announcement of the new loan, the
pound closed at $1.7187, up from $1.7162 Friday.
By mid-afternoon, a source close to the Bank of
England said it had bought about $70 million, fol
lowing purchases of between $600 million and
$700 million the previous week.
Top Spanish military judge abducted
Madrid — Kidnapers seized Spain's top military
judge yesterday and riot police routed leftist de
monstrators in street battles that killed one woman
student and injured eight other persons, officials
said.
The spiraling violence threatened this country's
delicate political balance.
Four gunmen abducted Lt. Gen. Emilio Villaes
cusa, president of the Supreme Court of Military
Justice, as he left his downtown apartment for his
office Monday morning, the army said. The kid
napers drove off with the 64-year-old army general
in his own car.
The newspaper Diario 16 said radical leftists
telephoned the paper and claimed responsibility
for the abduction. Police said one of the kidnapers
was identified as a member of a radical group.
Just a few minutes after the kidnaping, police
firing tear gas and rubber bullets and swinging riot
sticks clashed with left-wing protesters at the Mad
rid University campus and on the central Gran Via
avenue.
A woman student, Maria Najera Julian, 20, suf
fered fatal head injuries and eight other persons
Were injured. News accounts speculated the young
woman may have been hit by a police smoke gre
nade.
The demonstrators were denouncing the killing
of a student protester Sunday by two unidentified
men who apparently belonged to an ultraright or
ganization. That shooting occurred as police broke
up groups of leftist demonstrators demanding am
nesty for political prisoners.

Carter rescinds gas price decontrol
Washington — President Jimmy Carter yesterday
rescinded his predecessor's order lifting price and
allocation controls on gasoline. He said he wants to
review former President Gerald Ford's claim that
competition would restrain prices.
On the day before he left office, Ford lifted the
Federal Energy Administration controls on
gasoline. His action would have been effective
March 1 unless Congress objected.
"President Carter does not by this withdrawal
intend to imply any position on the ultimate merits
or demerits of gasoline decontrol." Wh : .t~ House
Press Secretary jody Powell told reporters, "ln
siouJ, h" ,n conduct a revie« r " 112
trols as an integral part of the development of an
over-all energy policy.
"Among other things, such a review will
examine the prior administration's contention that
competitive market forces would restrain prices for
motor gasoline below levels which would be per
missible even if controls remained in effect.'
Consumer groups have disputed this Ford ad
ministration contention, arguing that lifting the
controls would increase the cost of gasoline tor
consumers beyond increases which the controls
allowed.
Whites end Rhodesian shuttle talks
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Britain's shuttle diplo
macy to achieve a settlement between Rhodesia's
white minority and the black majority failed yes
terday.
Prime Minister lan Smith rejected British prop
osals for a transition government leading to black
rule in 14 months and told Rhodesians he did so
because they allowed for immediate control of the
country by a "Marxist indoctrinated minority."
One black nationalist group immediately ac
cused Smith of "opting for war." British Foreign
Secretary Anthony Crosland warned that southern
Africa faces "calamitous consequences."
Smith's action appeared to doom chances of a
return to the deadlocked Geneva conference, con
vened in November on the initiative of former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to seek agree
ment on the transfer of rule from the white minority
to the black majority in Rhodesia.
However, Smith said in a nationwide radio and
television speech that he would seek an internal
settlement between his government and the coun
try's 6.4 million blacks. He said it would be done
within the framework of a plan he accepted from
Kissinger in September and which black
nationalist leaders rejected at Geneva.
A recently formed conservative black group, the
Zimbabwe United People's Organization, said
Smith was right to reject the proposals and indi
cated its willingness-to enter negotiations for an
internal settlement.
Ivor Richard, the British chairman of the Geneva
conference who presented the proposals to Smith
earlier in ihe day in an effort to reconvene the talks,
said he saw no purpose in returning to Geneva
unless Smith changed his stance.
Richard blamed Smith for the collapse of negotia
tions and said he felt "sad and apprehensive" about
the future of Rhodesia, a British colony until Smith
unilaterally declared it independent in 1965. Black
guerrillas have been conducting a hit-and-run war

against whites in border areas for four years.
Cold wave freezes industry, farming
Florida — More than $120 million in damage to
Florida's citrus crop, a record-setting ice jam on the
Mississippi River and closed factory doors con
tinued to remind the nation of last week's deep
freeze temperatures, despite some weekend respite
from the cold.
Even the soft drink industry began feeling the
effects of the frigid weather, as energy shortages in
the South reduced the production of carbon
dioxide needed for the carbonated beverages.
Thousands were reported out of work as fuel
cutbacks continued to plague manufacturing firms
from Georgia to New York. The Federal Energy
Administration estimated yesteraay that up to
300,000 workers had been laid off during last
week's frigidity.
The more moderate weekend and yesterday's
readings will be followed by colder temperatures in
midweek, likely to aggravate the crop problems,
fuel shortages and transportation woes across the
eastern two-thirds of the nation, officials said.
In hard-hit Florida, agriculture experts met yes
terday to assess the damage from the worst freeze in
15 years. Growers have estimated that it will top
$120 million.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except patchy night and
morning fog and occasional high clouds. Lows to
night in upper 30s and 40s. Highs both days in the
upper 50s to mid 60s. Light winds.
