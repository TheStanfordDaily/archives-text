# It's good but not enough
## Reactions to pardon vary 
### Marc Strassman 
President Jimmy Carter's an
nouncement Friday of an uncondi
tional pardon for draft resisters has eli
cited opinions ranging from delight to
disappointment around campus.
"It was a good try," said Julia Brown,
a Columbae resident who describes
herself as "a middle-class American
suburbanite."
"I think it was a typical example of
an action by a supposedly liberal
Democratic government that really
isn't," she added.
David Harris, former student body
president here and a former Democra
tic candidate for Congress in the 12th
District, said, "I'm glad he did it, (but)
it's certainly not complete. Deserters
and those with less than honorable
discharges still haven't been dealt with

and they have to be dealt with."
Carter's unconditional pardon will
remove the threat of prosecution for
approximately 13,000 individuals
who refused induction into the armed
forces during the Vietnam Era or who
fled the country to avoid the draft, and
another estimated 250,000 persons
who never registered at all.
Resisting 'not wrong*
"I find it astounding," continued
Harris, who spent 18 months in federal
prison for refusing induction, "that 15
years after the war started, the only
issue the country's discussing is
whether we're still criminals for hav
ing opposed it."
In his own case, Harris said, "I don't
want to be forgiven. I wasn't wrong.
And neither were all those who re
fused to be called up."
Harris said that although he under
stands the President's action allows
him to "have my criminal record re
moved," Harris is not goiag to have
that done. "I worked real hard to get
that record. I'm not going to give it
away," he said.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), who defeated Harris last
November, speaking through his press
secretary Bill Johnson, said, "I'm de
lighted that President Carter has
moved rapidly on the amnesty issue. I
would hope that in respect to the less
than honorable discharges, he proceed
on a very lenient basis, upgrading the
discharges to honorable for anyone not
involved in a violent breach of the
law."
Extend pardon
"I am personally familiar with a
number of cases of very minor of
fenses, like smoking marijuana. If
you're going to pardon at all, it seems
very appropriate to include all those
actions which may have stemmed
from the unusual and controversial
circumstances of the Vietnam War,"

McCloskey continued.
"I am hopeful that the president will
resolve the problem of draft deserters
with the same sense of compassion he
has shown for those who evaded the
draft in a non-violent way. The Viet
nam War will not truly be a memory,"
he concluded, "until we recognize that
non-violent draft deserters deserve the
same forgiveness accorded to evaders."
Wendy Turnbull, media director of
the Western Regional Office of Am
nesty International, was more far
reaching in her criticism.
"We are delighted as far as the gen
eral pardon goes," she said but added,
"We are concerned about those who
resisted induction with force, with
those AWOL (absent without leave),
and with those who received less than
honorable discharges, which we un
derstand number 203,000. We are also
concerned that Carter would make this
an amnesty instead of a pardon, which
