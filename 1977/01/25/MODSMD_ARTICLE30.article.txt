## Bingo clears hurdle 
### Kurt Cobb Staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council passed
an ordinance last night to allow bingo
games in the city by a vote of 5-4. If the
council passes the measure again at its
second reading two weeks from now,
bingo will become legal.
The measure had been defeated at
the previous council meeting, but
Mayor Stanley Norton moved at that
meeting for a continuance because two
council members were absent. Con
sequently, the ordinance was given a
"second chance" to be passed.
The ordinance limits the total value
of prizes awarded at any one bingo
