# ASSU may drop charter
## No Hawaii flight? 
### Kathy Trafton Staff writer 
Joe Hess, manager of the ASSU
Travel Service, reported to the ASSU
Senate last night that the prospects for
a second Hawaiian charter this spring
are grim.
Part of the problem is that the Travel
Service would have to pay for two
round-trips between Hawaii and the
mainland. The first round-trip would
take passengers to Hawaii and the sec
ond round-trip would bring the pas
sengers back to the mainland. Ideally,
charters can be coordinated with
another group traveling from Hawaii
to the mainland. Hess said.
Hess said that there is a lot more
interest in Hawaii this year than in the
past. "It appears that we're always
going to have some demand at Stan
ford for charter flights. There is a high
convenience value for time here," he
said.
"This year more people have used
the charters than ever before. That
kind of surprised all of us. There has
been increasing concentration in the
air travel business, and we thought
that ABC (Advanced Booking Char
ters) would whittle away. But we are
going to be hurt by aircraft availabil
ity," he said.
Guest prof
Carter Lake of the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board told the senate that
"we are making great strides in pick
ing a guest professor." The board is
waiting for responses from such pros
pectives as "mostly libertarian"
economists and psychologists whom it
has contacted. Lake said.

Lake said that because the board's
fee assessment failed last year, there is
only enough money to hire one profes
sor. The board has about $3900 to
spend, he said.
The professor will not be required to
have an academic degree.
"We're looking at a black ex-convict
who's co-taught with Prof. Zimbardo
who knows his shit and can hold an
audience spell-bound," Lake said.
The senate appointed four represen
tatives to the ASSU Nominations
Committee.
"We now have an all-male Nomina
tions Committee," COP Vice President
A 1 Tomasczuk said.
Gregory Dowson was appointed
graduate representative until the end
of this quarter. Bill Offitz will then take
over the position. Kevin Childress was
selected undergraduate representa
tive, and Rodney Johnson was picked
as representative-at-large.
Administrative aide
Senate Chairman Pat Hall set up a
committee to appoint a new staff assis
tant for the Nominations Committee.
The assistant "is to act as a resource
person for students on university
committees, to keep file on the agen
das and minutes for all the committee
meetings, and to act as a liason bet
ween the senate and the COP," said
Steve Studman, who held the position
last quarter.
Studman said that he resigned from
the position because he felt it was too
much work for one person. "They
should have a task force to get informa
tion," he said.

to the mainland. Hess said.
Hess said that there is a lot more
interest in Hawaii this year than in the
past. "It appears that we're always
going to have some demand at Stan
ford for charter flights. There is a high
convenience value for time here," he
said.
"This year more people have used
the charters than ever before. That
kind of surprised all of us. There has
been increasing concentration in the
air travel business, and we thought
that ABC (Advanced Booking Char
ters) would whittle away. But we are
going to be hurt by aircraft availabil
ity," he said.
Guest prof
Carter Lake of the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board told the senate that
"we are making great strides in pick
ing a guest professor." The board is
waiting for responses from such pros
pectives as "mostly libertarian"
economists and psychologists whom it
has contacted. Lake said.

Lake said that because the board's
fee assessment failed last year, there is
only enough money to hire one profes
sor. The board has about $3900 to
spend, he said.
The professor will not be required to
have an academic degree.
"We're looking at a black ex-convict
who's co-taught with Prof. Zimbardo
who knows his shit and can hold an
audience spell-bound," Lake said.
The senate appointed four represen
tatives to the ASSU Nominations
Committee.
"We now have an all-male Nomina
tions Committee," COP Vice President
A 1 Tomasczuk said.
Gregory Dowson was appointed
graduate representative until the end
of this quarter. Bill Offitz will then take
over the position. Kevin Childress was
selected undergraduate representa
tive, and Rodney Johnson was picked
as representative-at-large.
Administrative aide
Senate Chairman Pat Hall set up a
committee to appoint a new staff assis
tant for the Nominations Committee.
The assistant "is to act as a resource
person for students on university
committees, to keep file on the agen
das and minutes for all the committee
meetings, and to act as a liason bet
ween the senate and the COP," said
Steve Studman, who held the position
last quarter.
Studman said that he resigned from
the position because he felt it was too
much work for one person. "They
should have a task force to get informa
tion," he said.
Joe Hess, manager of the ASSU
Travel Service, reported to the ASSU
Senate last night that the prospects for
a second Hawaiian charter this spring
are grim.
Part of the problem is that the Travel
Service would have to pay for two
round-trips between Hawaii and the
mainland. The first round-trip would
take passengers to Hawaii and the sec
ond round-trip would bring the pas
sengers back to the mainland. Ideally,
charters can be coordinated with
another group traveling from Hawaii
to the mainland. Hess said.
