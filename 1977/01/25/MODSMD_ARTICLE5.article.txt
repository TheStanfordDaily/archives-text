# U.S. to spend more on allies

Brussels, Belgium (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter is considering boosting
U.S. spending for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), but
other NATO members should be ready
to increase their own contributions as
well, Vice President Walter Mondale
told the alliance yesterday.
Despite plans to reduce the Penta
gon budget, "President Carter . . . told
me that he is prepared to consider in
creased U.S. investment in NATO's
defense," Mondale told NATO minis
ters at the start of his 10-day world
tour.
But the new vice president warned
the ministers that though the United
States might make some unilateral in
creases, further increases would be
made only as part of a cooperative ef
fort by all 15 nations in the alliance.
On to Germany
His comments came in a speech to
the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
minister-level supervisory body, in
this headquarters city of the European
community. It was closed to reporters,
but the prepared text was later made
available and the vice president spoke
to reporters about it.
Mondale then flew to Bonn for a
meeting today with Chancellor Hel
mut Schmidt.
Since taking office last Thursday,
Carter has restated his campaign
promise to cut the defense budget by
between $5 billion and $7 billion by
eliminating waste.
Mondale said that with Carter's in
structions he was reporting to the
NATO ministers that "his new budget
and these efficiencies will not result in
any decrease in planned investment in
NATO defense — and these plans in
volve some growth."
More for NATO
"He told me that he is prepared to
consider increased U.S. investment in
NATO's defense," Mondale said.
Carter told the NATO ministers in a
message last month that the alliance
"lies at the heart of the partnership
between North America and Western
Europe" and was essential to security.
The Mondale speech represented an
affirmation of tangible support.

In speaking with reporters, the vice
president emphasized the section of
his speech dealing with NATO spend
ing and said Pentagon cuts would not
affect "NATO defense muscle."
The warning that other members of
NATO must consider possible in
creases in their own contributions
comes in the wake of British plans to
cut their over-all military budget, a
move that would probably mean re
duced British spending on NATO.
Alliance 'ill-prepared'
In a grim assessment of NATO's
condition after a visit to the area, Sens.
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Dewey Bartlett
(R-Okla.), warned that Soviet forces
have been strengthened to a point
where the military balance in Europe
has been "dramatically altered" in the
Communist side's favor.
Their report to the Senate Armed
Services committee came as Congress
prepares for its annual study of U.S.
military posture and weapons re
quirements.
Nunn told a news conference that
Carter was aware of the NATO study,
and said he himself had discussed it
briefly with Mondale on Saturday.
'Flexible response' criticized
While outlining a long list of de
ficiencies in almost every aspect of
NATO's military structure, the report
focused on the question of how much
warning time the forces defending
Western Europe, and Germany in par
ticular, would have to prepare for a
Warsaw Pact attack.
The present U.S. strategy of "flexi
ble response" to an attack assumes that
there would be about three weeks
notice, time enough to tighten de
fenses and bring in reinforcements
from other parts of Europe and the Un
ited States and Canada.
But the Senate report, which draws
heavily on a Pentagon-authorized
study last year by retired Lt. Gen.
James Hollingsworth, argued that
Communist forces already massed on
the German border have "an ability to
initiate a potentially devastating inva
sion . . . with as little as a few days
warning."
