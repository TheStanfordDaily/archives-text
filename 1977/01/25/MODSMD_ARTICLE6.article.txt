# Fate of Bonfire in limbo

### Will Nixon 
A Santa Clara County supervisor is
seeking student opinion here on
whether the Big Game Bonfire tradi
tion should be continued.
Geraldine Steinberg, Santa Clara
County representative on the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD) said she wants to gauge
student enthusiasm for continuing the
big blaze so that she "can better repre
sent their interests" should the issue
come up for a vote in early February,
according to her aide, Beth Zientek.
On Jan. 5, the BAAPCD, the commis
sion which will determine the fate of
the bonfire, reached a seven to seven
deadlock vote on a motion to drop con
sideration of a regulation which would
effectively ban the bonfire. Four mem
bers were not present for the vote.
BAAPCD member Dan McCor-
Quodale, another Santa Clara County
supervisor, recommended that the
subject be brought up again in early
February. He had voted against the
motion. Two other Santa Clara County
representatives on the BAAPCD,
Steinberg and Ruth Koehler, sup
ported the motion. By supporting the
motion, Steinberg and Koehler expres
sed disapproval of a total ban on the
bonfire.
"I would guess that if there were
enough votes not to drop the motion
then there would be enough votes to
prohibit the bonfire," said BAAPCD
Information Officer Paul Brand.
Feebler flame
The original regulation proposal
was submitted by Ecology Action of
Menlo Park. It requested that the
BAAPCD restrict recreational fires to
nine cubic feet and one gallon of
lighter fluid. According to a study by
BAAPCD researcher Milton Phelds
tein, a 45-foot-high bonfire has a vol
ume of almost 32,000 cubic feet. The
last bonfire in 1975 was 25 feet high,
smaller than fires held in previous
years. This year's fire would have been
even smaller.
The fire's polluting effects have be
come a point of controversy during re
cent years. The BAAPCD has received
numerous complaints from Palo Alto
residents. In 1975, rhe BAAPCD sent a
letter to the ASSU Council of Presi
dents urging a more environmentally
acceptable pre-game event other than
the bonfire.
"If she (Steinberg) can have some
sampling of student opinion at Stan
ford, she can better represent their in
terests," said Zientek. Steinberg, who
became a county supervisor this year,
said she "will go to bat for Stanford,"
added Zientek.
"I'd be interested to know how the

students feel," said Los Altos Coun
cilwoman Koehler. She said the prop
osition to restrict recreational fires to
nine cubic feet and one gallon of
lighter fluid is unreasonable.
"Holding fires under a certain size
would mean that someone from
BAAPCD would have to be there to
measure every burning fire," said
Koehler.
Student support present
Jordan Schwartz, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council which spon
sors the bonfire, said he felt that this
tradition has "wide student support."
"The bonfire has two purposes; the
tradition and to serve as a rallying
point for Stanford support," he said.
"It seemed people were positive this
year, not overwhelmingly so, but it

seemed to me that the bonfire had very
positive support," Schwartz said. He
interpreted the quiet response to the
event this year as opposed to previous
years as a vote of support.
"If you were to hold an election
today on support of the bonfire, the
result would be very, very close," said
ASSU President Vic Petroff. He termed
the bonfire "one of the most divisive
issues that (the COP) faces every year."
James Lyons, dean of student affairs,
called the bonfire "a matter of primar
ily student concern." He said the ad
ministration prefers not to become too
involved in the matter.
"The event has had value in the past,
but it certainly has less value today
now that it is so tinged with hard feel
ings," said Lyons.
