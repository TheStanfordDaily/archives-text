### 
As one who has often disagreed with various
aspects of the Daily in the past, I know how
essential it is for these disagreements to be
made public and'conveyed to the appropriate
part of the Daily staff. Now that I am chairman
of the Board of Directors of the Stanford Daily
Publishing Corporation, as well as the student
representative on the board, I feel it is incum
bent upon me to provide members of the Stan
ford community with an opportunity to air
their differences.
Therefore, on Jan. 26 at 4:15 p.m. inTresidder
132, there will be an open forum to discuss the
Daily for all concerned Stanford persons.
Please come and bring any and all criticisms,
suggestions, complaints and grievances which

you may have, and which may cover anything
from editorial policy to newswriting com
petency to advertisement acceptance policy. I
promise to listen to each of you and to take back
your thoughts to the Board of Directors.
Moreover, I plan to establish these open forums
as a monthly occurrence, so members of the
community can and will have constant input
into their — our — paper.
1 urge all those interested to come to the open
forum. After all, you can't be heard unless you
make some noise.
