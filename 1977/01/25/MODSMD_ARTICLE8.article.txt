# Theme houses transcend dorms

The January 18 Daily editorial cal
ling for an examination of the theme
house concept represents a portion of
the student body narrow in thought
and limited in vision, unlike Daily
staffs of yesteryear.
The Daily correctly states that the
theme house concept is designed for
those who wish to extend the semi
formal educational process into their
daily living situation, but narrowly de
fines "substantive academic prog
rams" to be solely those officially
sanctioned by the university via de
partmental programs.
Such an attitude totally mis
construes the point of the theme house
program. Students wishing to pursue
lifestyles which incorporate facets of
various academic disciplines typically
seek theme houses which articulate
these concepts.
While the German, French and Ita
lian theme houses represent a facet of
such articulation, they by no means
define the whole, nor should they re
ceive deferential (sic) treatment with
"different criteria" established for
their justification.
All theme houses should represent a
lifestyle or philosophy which requires
residents to make substantial intel
lectual commitments, and those which
question traditional values, such as the
proposed Androgyny House, repre

sent the apotheosis of such commit
ment.
Theme houses should not be
evangelical, but should be ideological.
The ideology of alternative lifestyles
involves intellectual commitments
which transcend the mundane exis
tence of dormitory life, the scourge of a
preponderance of Stern and Wilbur re
sidents.
This opportunity is an essential
element of one's liberal arts education.
To subsume ideology and proselytism
under the same label is a gross miscon
ception of the liberal arts educational
process, reminiscent of those right
wing conservatives who confuse in
struction about Marxist ideology with
communist indoctrination.
The establishment of Androgyny
House would be a major contribution
to the stagnant, sexist, purportedly
"intellectual" community at Stanford.
Androgyny House residents' com
mitment to feminism and liberation
from our discriminatory and confining
sex roles would be a welcome relief to
attitudes in a community represented
(?) by a tabloid (sic) that feels compel
led to make excuses for its new editor
because of her sex.
Androgyny House's proposed
consciousness-raising sessions should
be requisite fare for Daily staffers.
Feminism deemphasizes sex as a de

fining characteristic, stressing
humanism over sex, enabling people
to choose careers and lifestyles with
out concern about sex
appropriateness. Sex comes to assume
the relative importance of hair color,
supplanted by more salient charac
teristics.
The Androgyny House would at
tempt to free men and women from
their prescribed sex roles, eradicating
sexism and providing the campus with
a refreshing, new outlook on what it
means to be a human in an artifically
dichotomized world.
