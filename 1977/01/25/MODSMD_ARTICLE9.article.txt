# Studying languages raises awareness

John Toenje's Jan. 17 Daily column
was much appreciated, for it is a plea
sure to see the question of language
debated in a philosophical vein.
Toenjes emphasizes the irrational
nature of language in contrast to
statements made by French and Italian
Dept. Chairman Alphonse Juilland
and Philosophy Prof. Julius
Moravcsik. Although I am not sure the
professors have been as categorical as
Toenjes' column implies, the follow
ing considerations may be in order.
Throughout the past century,
French literature for one, tends to de
pict language as a meeting ground be
tween the rational and the irrational.
'Pure event'
Between the "pure event" of crea
tive expression and "nothingness" in
Valery's terms, stretches the whole
range of verbal communication. The
20th century writer who is an heir to
Freud and Jung must communicate
precisely from such depths.
But the very idea of communication
implies reliance on a common code
which is eminently rational.
Even the surrealists who relentlessly
exploited the sub-conscious, were
forced to associate language with the
"central point" at which all conflict
ing tensions are resolved. The clarity

and sheer beauty of their writing dur
ing the war years testify to their ac
complishment.
Another question
But the case for language study re
volves around another question. To
what extent do we wish to identify
with the advent of words within ourse
lves and in the great writers?
At what distance do we wish to
place ourselves as we observe, for in
stance, the sinuous, labyrinthine self
awareness to be found in the original
mold of Proust's expression?
Obviously, the alternative to close
ness in this sense is reading in transla
tion. But this is a derivative approach
which requires less preparation, less
discipline and ultimately less know
ledge.
The study of a foreign language en
hances many levels of awareness, but
it requires time and effort. Here there
can be no substitute for rationality.
