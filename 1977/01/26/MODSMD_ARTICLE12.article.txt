# What if King Kong came to Stanford?
## 
### 
Jane Goodall leaned back in her
chair at Stanford's Primate Research
Lab as the frizzy orangutan named Til
ley clunked plastic blocks onto the
sentence board. Jane read each one
aloud.
"So-cheetah-says-to-Tarzan
'human-see, human-do.' Oh Tilley,
you are so witty," chirped Jane. Tilley
slapped more blocks on the board.
"I-want-banana," he said.
Jane scratched the red bush on top of
his head. "Certainly, dear Tilley. I'll
have to get it from inside." Tilley
cooed with delight.
As she reached the door, the tele
phone rang. "Hello, Jane Goodall
speaking." The other voice was weak
and distant.
"Jane? (static) Gombe East. Guer
rilla! Guerrilla!"
"Oh no! Has anyone been kid
naped?" she shrilled.
"No, gorilla, not guerrilla. We've
found a 90 foot ape named King
Kong."
"Don't give me any monkey busi
ness. Is this for real?" said the Sultana
of Simians.
Local natives
"Yes, Jane. The local natives led us
to him. We've put him on an oil tanker
for Stanford. He should arrive in a few
weeks. Jane, do you know what this
means? Fame, fortune, your face on
National Geographic."
"Yes, yes," said Jane absently, as she
envisioned neon lights before her,
reading: "Jane and Kong." She had hit
the big time.
The next few weeks were hectic for
Gombe West. The Primate Research
Lab was too small to accommodate
King Kong and the ape refused to live
in Stern, so he was placed, sedated and
chained, into Stanford Stadium. Jane
began her observations of King with
Tilley acting as interpreter.
"Gee, he is the biggest ape I've ever
seen," said Jane. "Tilley, ask him why
he is staring at me in such a peculiar
fashion."
Long, deep moan s
Tilley emitted a long series of
grunts, shrieks and whoops. Kong

answered with a long, deep moan. Til
ley then flipped some blocks onto his
language board. Jane read them.
"Kong-says-he-is-in-love-with-the
cute-blonde-next-to-me. Why, that's
me!" discerned Jane. "But it will never
work. We're from different religious
backgrounds."

Just then, President Richard Lyman
walked up to Jane. "Jane, we've de
cided to show King Kong to the public.
After all, it is getting expensive to buy
all those bananas for him. Why don't
you get Kong all gussied up and give
him another shot of tranquilizer or
something."
"But President Lyman, I don't think
it would be wise," pleaded the Gorilla
Goddess. "Kong isn't used to civiliza
tion yet. He might try to escape. If
money is the problem, we could sell
'Kong Chips' to the fraternities to use
in the next Big Game Bonfire."
'Raise a stink'
"No," replied Lyman, "the en
vironmentalists would raise a stink,
not to mention the fire. We're going
ahead with the public showing. See
you tonight."
That evening, people streamed to
humble Stanford Stadium to see the
unveiling of King Kong.
Vendors from White Plaza proved
innovative with their specially created
"Kong" merchandise which they
hawked. The candymen sold Rhesus
Peanut Cups. The snackmen peddled
corn chips in the shape of monkeys
called "Cheetahs." And the more
avant-garde of the entrepreneurs sold
ape-shaped water pipes called,
"Kongs."
The crowd murmured in awe as it

entered the stadium and saw the huge
ape. King Kong grew restless as the
stadium filled to capacity. The Stan
ford Band played, "Hey, Hey, We're
the Monkees."
The crowd exploded with applause
when Jane promenaded into the spot
light. Reporters and fans broke
through the arm-linked policemen and
mobbed her.
Shackles fell
King Kong looked down and
growled in protest as the little men
tussled "his girl." The chains snap
ped. The shackles fell. King Kong was
free.
Everyone ran for his life. Kong
reached down into the panicking
surges of humanity, brushing people
away from his beloved Jane as if they
were wingless flies. He clutched her in
his massive grip and stalked toward
the exit. He had one goal in mind,
Hoover Tower.
Nothing would stop him now. His
huge legs, like awesome Roman col
umns, would pile-drive any hapless
hero who dared to stand in his way.
He reached Hoo Tow, and carefully
placed Jane on his shoulder. He
grasped the gray tower and huffed and
tugged himself to the top. Police sur
rounded the tower and flooded the top
with searchlights. Jane screamed in
terror. The crowd gazed on helplessly.
And King Kong beat his chest and bel
lowed his royalty to the world.
In the chaos below, a man dressed in
a white dinner jacket and black bowtie
tapped the quivering chief of police
with his walking stick.
'Excuse me'
"Excuse me, officer," said the man,
"but what is going on here?"
The policeman whirled around.
"Senator Morrow! Am I glad to see
you. King Kong has escaped and grab
bed Jane Goodall and I don't know
what to do and ..."
"There, there, my good man," com
forted the august senator. I'll have that
ape down in a jiffy, or my name isn't
Rick Morrow."
Ricker grabbed a megaphone and
started negotiating with Kong.

"Hi Kong. My name is Sen. Rick
Morrow. You can call me Ricker. I was
thinking that maybe we could talk
about your situation." King leaned
over to hear the words of the puny hu
man.
"First, I'd like to talk to you about
Jane. Maybe we can make some sort of
a deal. As an ASSU senator, I help
select guest professors for Stanford
each year. Maybe we could get you to
teach a class on the Marxist and/or
feminist perspective on apedom. Why,
we might even form a new Department
of Apeology at Stanford and make you
the chairperson."
Kong shook Hoover's pinnacle and
roared his disapproval. "Ok, ok," said
Morrow. "You will be called 'chaircre
ature. I don't mean to be apeist. We
could even rename the Stanford golf
course 'Stanford's Missing Links.' But
you'll have to give us Jane back first."
Clutched wildly
King Kong raised to full length to
protest such an inhuman, er.ingorilla
demand. Suddenly, his left foot shot
from under him. He screamed and
clutched wildly for the spire, but it was
too late. He plummeted down and
crashed into the concrete by Mem
Aud.
"What happened? mused Morrow
incredulously. He looked up and saw a
fuzzy red orangutan climbing down
from the tower.
"Tilley, you crazy ape! What were
you doing?" Tilley whipped out his
sentence board. "Kong-fell-because-
I-put-banana-peel-under-his-foot," he
replied.
"Tilley. that's great," cried Morrow
jubilantly. "I'm going to nominate you
for the new school mascot."
Just then JaneGoodall walked off the
elevator from Hoover Tower, battered
but all right.
People began to walk away. Soon the
crowd was no more. A lone man stood
over the corpse of King Kong. It was
Stanford's new football coach, Bill
Walsh. He stared for a moment, sighed
and turned away, saying, "No Rose
Bowl next year. Kong would have
made a heck of a linebacker."
