# Letters: hand-slapping, abortion

Morale booster
The new idea to slap "ten" with a fan
before each basketball game is indeed
a great morale booster for the Stanford
team. The hand-slapping really in
creases spectator involvement in the
games as a Jan. 19 Daily article de
scribed.
Yet, it is ironic that the team came up
with such an "original" idea shortly
after playing Colorado State Univer
sity (CSU). The CSU team has been
using the hand-slapping as a spirit
booster for several years and used it
when playing Stanford.
I would think the Stanford team
could have at least mentioned that it
saw the same thing done by the Col
orado State team. Let's give the credit
for this unique idea where the credit is
due!

Callous extinction
A painful anniversary was marked
this past weekend. Four years ago the
Supreme Court withdrew the protec
tion of law from a minority segment of
society in its controversial decision on
abortion. The result has been an in
crease to one million occurences per
year of sanctioned death. It is a terrible
thing to see such a callous extinction
of human life.
Proponents of abortion advance sev
eral basic arguments in their defense.
The first is usually the woman's right
to control her own body. Any limita
tion on this control is considered to be
an unjustifiable intervention.
But the time for control is before
conception, not after. Once created,
life cannot be disposed of on grounds
so weak.
The next suggestion is that mental
and emotional suffering may be in
flicted by unwanted pregnancy, espe

cially on teenagers. This is undoub
tedly true, but hardly sufficient to jus
tify the taking of another life.
Which brings us to the one irreduci
ble argument which abortionists must
make is their postition is to have any
support at all: namely that an unborn
child is not life.
But that is simply not true. The em
bryo is indeed alive. It is genetically
complete. Nothing more will be added
â€” ever. It will only develop the nature
which is present from the first mo
ment. It grows. It does things no in
animate object ever could. The fetus is
clearly alive. It is merely at an earlier
stage of development.
A variation on this argument is that
abortion is only a withdrawal of life
support. If the unborn child is incapa
ble of sustaining life outside the
womb, they say, they let nature take its
course. But the extension of that is the
ancient Spartan custom of abandoning
babies on the hillside to let them die.

Even after birth, a child needs suste
nance for its life to continue. Inability
to be entirely self-supporting is no jus
tification for removing life-support,
before or after.
The only abortion argument which
can be sustained is the protection of
the health of the mother. If one life is to
be exchanged for another, the parent
can legitimately claim right of survi
val. Hut outside this boundary the for
cible termination of defenseless life
cannot be tolerated.
The current availability of abortion
is an offense to the spirit of a nation
which has long prided itself on being a
champion of human rights And it is a
source of profound sorrow to many
thoughtful people. We must have a
Constitutional amendment guarante
eing the full protection of the law to
the unborn.
