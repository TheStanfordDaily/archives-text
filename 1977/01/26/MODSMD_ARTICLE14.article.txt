# Stanford Enology Club
## Wine tasting gains popularity here 
### Harry Killas 
Where do you go on campus to
taste a $25 bottle of 1966 Haut
Brion? Or learn to distinguish
between a Sauvignon Blanc and
a Chardonnay, or between a
Spanish and an Italian wine?
Each quarter, three wine-tasting
courses are offered by two
former Standord students who
call themselves Wine As
sociates.
Alec White, a buyer for Gemel
lo's winery, and Bruce Cass, a
member of the Alcohol Educa
tion Research Institute, are two
knowledgable enologists who in
1973 taught an undergraduate
special on viticulture for four
quarters.
Although the university co
vered the cost of the wines, it
refused to pay Cass and White
$30 as an honorarium. Con
sequently, with ASSU support,
Cass and White formed the Stan
ford Enology Club, through
which they run the wine-tasting
courses. The club exists in the
books, but is not an active cam
pus organization.
Wine Associates offer three
courses: Basic Wine Tasting
($45), California ($4O), and
European ($5O) tasting classes.
This quarter, the Basic class
meets on Mondays, the Califor
nian on Tuesdays and the Euro
pean on Thursdays, all at 7:30
p.m. Each course lasts nine
weeks and includes a final on
which the students usually do
well. Call Wine Associates at
365-1414 for information on
where and how to get into these
classes.
The Basic class assumes one
knows nothing about wines.

Lectures cover the history of
wine and techniques of tasting.
Class members are exposed to
wines from California and
Europe, to different grapes (such
as Cabernet and Chardonnay),
and to roses, champagnes,
aperitifs, and fortified wines,
brandies and cognacs. This is the
most popular class, according to
White.
The California class explores
local varieties and wineries. The
European class covers the many
regions of France (such as Bor
deaux and the Loire), as well as
Cerman, Spanish, and Italian
wines. Much attention is given
to reading the labels and under
standing the appellations.
Each class begins with an in
formal lecture for about an hour
and a half Then the ten wines to
be tasted are served, usually in
pairs to facilitate comparison.
Students of the courses, how
ever, are advised to bring four
wine glasses to class. Cass and
White serve fruit, cheese and
bread to neutralize the palate be
tween wines.
Reaction important
They also encourage note tak
ing, not so much in the lectures,
but during the actual tasting of
the wines. White and Cass say
that if one writes down his own
reaction to the wine, he will be
able to remember that wine more
distinctly. Consequently, stu
dents often grope for fruits, nuts
and other adjectives to remind
them of what a wine smells and
tastes like.
Cass says that response to
these courses has been very en
thusiastic. Senior Monica Sloan
remarked that the European

course made her "a more dis
criminating consumer with a
more developed palate. I espe
cially enjoyed the unpretentious
approach to wine."
People who take the Basic
class view it more as a lecture,
says Cass, whereas the European
and California classes are more
"seminarish." They are a good
place to discover the better buys
and restaurants and, Cass adds,
"they are lots of fun, with some
ribald stories and good times."
Various Stanfordites have taken
the courses — about ten profes
sors, some undergraduates, but
mostly business, medicine and
other graduate students.
Demand for more
Bob Matthews is a fourth-year
student in electrical engineering
and the secretary-treasurer of the
Enology Club. He and Cass
noticed that there was an im
mediate and enthusiastic de
mand for more wine information
after one finished the courses,
but that the courses were "as far
as you could go." After taking all
three courses, he became in
volved in a tasting group which
meets every other Thursday to
compare and discuss wines.
Starting February 2 and con
tinuing every Wednesday at 7:30

p.m., Cass and White will hold
six tasting sessions at different
localities on campus. A different
Californian varietal will be
tasted each night: Zinfandel,
Cabernet, Riesling, Chardonnay,
Sauvignon Blanc, and Gewuz
traminer. Eight wines (and
therefore eight glasses) of each
variety include six new releases
and two old stand-bys. At the
evening's end, they will be
ranked.
Information
Cass expects the cost of most
of the tastings to be around four
dollars, with the Zinfandel night
around $2.50. Reservations are
essential so that they know how
much wine to buy. Cass says that
tasting groups are a "good way
to meet people and a cheap way
to get information." They are
also good for establishing your
own opinion, adds Matthews.
Cass and Matthews indicated
that the Enology Club should
provide information to the
community. Matthews says,
"We need a place to go to find
out what (tasting) groups need
members. The Club could pro
vide that service."
Wine Associates hope to pub
lish a mailing list, and maybe a
newsletter, for people in the tast

ing groups and past students.
This will also make the Club
more active on campus. Cass
notes that in the past, publicity
has been a weak area. Fliers are
expensive, word of mouth is
often unreliable. Because of poor
support last spring quarter, the
European class was not offered.
Education and appreciation
Cass has been approached by
some RAs and resident faculty
members to offer seminars on al
cohol education at various
dorms, especially freshman
ones. He strongly believes that
since people "learn to drink at
Stanford," they need to be edu
cated in the use of alcohol. "We
need some sensory appreciation
to go with it,"he said.
Currently, however, Cass is
trying to get academic credit for
their wine courses. The lectures
would perhaps have a broader
focus and incorporate general
"alcohol education," and the
aesthetics of drinking. They
would also like class space and
salary for teachers. But Cass says
the university is "nervous"
about the alcohol issue, largely
because of Mrs. Stanford's will
and the recent "pub" debate, in
which a move to establish a pub
on campus failed.

Line 'em up
Cass says it's important when learning about wines to line them
up and compare. Here Randy Quinn pours a 1970 Gemello's
Zinfandel as Sue Matthews looks on.

on campus.
