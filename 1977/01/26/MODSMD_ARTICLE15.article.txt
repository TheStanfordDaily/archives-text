# Women's center: something to CROW about
## 
### Karen Koman 
Unbeknownst to the MCP's
(that's Male Chauvinist Pigs)
that graze complacently on the
perenially puddle-ridden grass
of Stanford, there exists a fervent
group of feminists who are work
ing to even the score around
here. The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) is in its third
year of existence and, according
to Marilyn Yalom, a research
scholar at the CROW, has just en
tered into a new era of develop
ment and growth.
CROW has become quite a vi
able organization, as evidenced
by the number of supporters it
has amassed and its recent entr
ance into Stanford academia
with its Thursday noon lecture
series and a number of woman
related courses developed
within various departments on
campus.
The lecture series covers such
topics as "Sexuality"; "Birth
Control"; and"The Use of
Psychotropic Drugs by Women".
The lectures, which correspond
to a class on "Woman's Health",
are open to the public and have
been amazingly popular, attract
ing between 150 and 200 people
at each lecture, according to
Yalom.
Another indication that in

terest in studying the role of
women has not faded is the re
cent awarding of five research
grants to CROW by the Ford
Foundation. The grants, total
ling $6500, have been allotted to
several faculty members, enabl
ing them to pursue various pro
jects about women and their
traditional "function" in soci
ety.
Margo Davis, a lecturer in Un
dergraduate Studies, and
Michelle Rosaldo, Asst. Prof, of
Anthropology,were beneficiaries
of the largest grant, $2500, for
their study of "Women in Higher
Education at Stanford." Their
research will concentrate on
women faculty members here
who have distinguished them
selves in the past half-century.
David Tyack and Myra Strober
were recipients of a $1000 grant
for their project, entitled
"Feminization of Teaching in
the 19th Century". Through re
search, they will attempt to de
termine why women
monopolize the field of elemen
tary education and the effect that
this has had on our culture.
Men in education
In an interview with Joy
Yamahoto of CROW, Tyack re
vealed some of his viewpoints
on the teaching profession and

his concern about its future. One
particular curiosity for Tyack is
"why men dominate over a pre
dominately female occupation,"
in the guise of principals and
school board officials.
He concluded, "I am a little
leery about males being pre
scriptive about ideology and
practice; I think men have been
prescribing for women too long.
Rather than telling women this
is what they should be doing, I
hope women can use the data (of
this study) in figuring out how to
get leverage on the system."
Yalom, one of the three full
time staff members at CROW, is
elated at the recent flurry of in
terest in feminism which has
been noticable on campus. She
cited the "thorough integration"
of feminism and its broad spec
trum of goals into the university
community as one of the main
concerns of CROW at this time.
Yalom stressed her concern
that CROW and its feminist goals
not be relegated to an isolated
stratum in the Stanford com
munity. Her definition of
feminists is "people interested
in ameliorating the condition of
women. This includes the evolu
tion of the roles of men and
women in our society." What
she advocates is a humanist

movement which would liberate
both sexes from their
stereotyped roles, thus creating a
healthier, less oppressive envi
ronment.
Imbalance
Yalom said that while she is
a feminist, she refuses to also be
labeled a "man-hater". While
viewing the recent furor over
androgyny as significant, she
feels that "feminism is still a
necessary term because of the
imbalance that has existed
throughout history between men
and women. Now this imbalance
is being redressed and until ev
erything is resolved, it is neces
sary to distinguish ourselves
from other more general groups
such as the humanists."
Minority
When asked her opinion on
the stereotyped "bra-burner"
image of a feminist, Yalom re
plied that the majority of
feminists were not so vehement
or radical. A number of women
have over-reacted at times, while
a small minority have used the
movement to "express their own
personal animosities and hang
ups". These women, however,
are in the minority and
shouldn't be considered por

traits of the "typical" feminist,
she said.
Stanford, according to Yalom,
is a "little provincial or in the
boondocks" in regard to the
feminist movement. "Women
are under-represented on the fa
culty, especially in tenure posi
tions" and she feels that it will be
a long time "before we can
achieve any type of balance,"
Yalom said.
No role models
The main problem with the
scarcity of women professors is
not that women are being dis
criminated against by their male
teachers, but rather that they
have few "role models" to look
up to and imitate, according to
Sandra Bern, asst. prof, in
psychology.
The future seems a little bit
brighter for the women's move
ment under the Carter administ
ration. CROW has
ceived a letter from Carter's staff
outlining plans to integrate a
"talent bank of women" into the
government. "But don't count
on it," advises Yalom.
"Women may have a handful of
more jobs in the lower levels of
government, but in the higher
decision-making ranks, women
will probably be as scarce as
ever."
