# Motorized bicycles reclassified
## Mopeds sell as novel transport 
### Bill Burger 
California residents are taking
a new form of transportation to
the streets this year: mopeds.
Commonly seen in almost every
European country, these
motorized bicycles are now sel
ling well in California where
only a year ago they were reclas
sified from motorcycle status to
that of a motorized bicycle.
The new law means that
mopeds do not have to be
licensed with the state; their op
eration, however, is restricted to
persons possessing a valid
driver's license or to 15 year-olds
who have a driver's permit.
Mopeds may use bike lanes, ex
cept in public parks and their top
speed is limited to 30 mph.
All the mopeds we investi
gated used two cycle engines
which require a gas and oil mix
ture for fuel, and all got between
100 and 150 mpg. They also had
one-speed automatic transmis
sions using no clutch.

Of the one Redwood City and
four Palo Alto stores we
visited, the only one which
specializes in mopeds is "Effort
less Bike," located at 2123 El
Camino. Open only two months,
this store sells two brands of
mopeds: Puch, made in Austria
with models selling at $470 and
$500, and Smily, Italian made,
with a model priced at $195.
Dennis Chretion, who jointly
owns the shop with Pete Mod
rich, reports that "sales have
been good thus far." He expects
sales to pick up considerably in
the spring, and the store war
ranty includes six months parts
and labor.
Rhea's Schwinn Cyclery, 424
Emerson Street in Palo Alto, has
had Batavus mopeds in stock
since the week before Christmas.
Made in Holland, Batavus has
two models priced at $439 and
$469. The warranty at Rhea's is
also six months parts and labor,
and Rhea says that the bikes are

selling well. She also expects the
sales to pick up this spring.
The Western Auto Store at 620
Emerson St. in Palo Alto sells a
Czech-made Jawa-Babette
moped selling for $299 plus
dealer preparation and assembly
charges. Only two bikes are car
ried in stock but orders take only
a week to fill. Sales are reported
to be good at the store and the
buyers are said to be happy.
Western Auto has carried
mopeds for eight months now
and the warranty is 30 days or
300 miles parts and labor. A free
150 to 200 mile service check is
also given by the store.
Tony's Bike Shop, 4151 El
Camino Way in Palo Alto, carries
the only American made moped,
Columbia, whose commuter
model sells for $499. Tony's
began carrying the mopeds just
over a month ago and has a one
year warranty on the Columbia
moped's frame and a 90 day war
ranty on everything, including

tires, tubes and light bulbs.
Viva Vespa, located at 2671 El
Camino in Redwood City, sells
the Italian made Vespa Products
mopeds. This brand comes in
five models ranging in price
from $:i95 to $515. The same
basic frame and engine is used in
all these models, however, and
the price varies with the acces
sories included. Viva Vespa has
been selling mopeds for over a
year and a half now, and owner
Gordon Myers expects sales to
pick-up again this spring as it
did last year. Viva Vespa's war
ranty is nine months parts and
labor.
It seems clear that mopeds are
here to stay in California. Four
Palo Alto stores, all carrying
mopeds for less than a year, are
now competing for their share of
the community's business and
all seem pleased with their pros
pects. Stanford University rep
resents a tremendous potential
pool of buyers.
