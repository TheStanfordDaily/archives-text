# Cold winter creates energy crisis; lack of natural gas causes problem
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —One cold
winter and suddenly the U.S.
energy crisis is back. This time,
however, you can't blame the
Arabs.
The problem is that there's not
enough natural gas to go around.
The result has been grim:
schools closed, industries shut
down and hundreds of
thousands ot workers laid oft in
areas hardest hit by shortages.
President Carter, the Federal
Power Commission (FPC), the
Federal Energy Administration
(FEA), and congressional com
mittees are working on
emergency measures that may
help, but won't fully solve the
problem.
Last Friday, the day after his
inauguration. Carter ordered the
thermostats in the White House
and other federal buildings
turned down to 65 degrees
Fahrenheit and urged the rest of
the nation to follow his example.

Carter says it may be several
years before those thermostats
can be turned back up.
Here, in question-and-answer
form is a rundown of what's
gone wrong, why, and what is
being done about it:
Q. .1 remember the Arab oil em
bargo back in 1973 and the
gasoline lines and all that, but
it's been over four years and we
haven't had any energy crisis.
Now all of a sudden we're run
ning out of fuel. Why didn't any
body warn us this was coming?
A. Arab oil has nothing to do
with this winter's problem,
which is caused by a shortage of
our own natural gas. Further
more, we were warned re
peatedly by government gas ex
perts, the gas industry, and news
media. But some of us weren't
listening.
Q. There wasn't any gas shortage
the last couple of winters, was
there? How come it suddenly
developed now?
A. There has been a natural gas
shortage since about 1971 and it
has grown steadily larger each
winter, but it didn't hurt much
for two reasons: at first, the only
customers to have service shut
off temporarily were industrial
plants which had contracted for
"interruptible" service and were
prepared to switch to other fuels.
More recently, the cuts have
gone deeper, into industries that
depend on continuous natural
gas service including some that
cannot use other fuels. When
their gas is shut off, their plants
shut down and their workers go
home.
Secondly, the United States
had unusually mild winters for
the past few years. Otherwise the
shortage would have hit harder,
sooner. This year, parts of the
United States have had record

cold weather and the gas supply
just can't meet the heavy de
mand.
Q. Does this mean that gas will
be shut off to homes and hospi
tals and essential public services
too?
A. No. The FEA says there is
enough gas to serve these high
priority users, provided it is de
livered where it is most needed.
The immediate problem is plant
and business shutdowns.
Q. How many shutdowns are
there?
A. Nobody knows for sure, but
the FFC has been checking by
telephone with interstate
pipelines. The FPC has reported
shutdowns most frequently in
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
South Carolina, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and Ohio, with
scattered plant closings in New
Jersey, Maryland, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois
and Indiana.
Q There must be thousands of
people out of work, then.
A. Hundreds of thousands. The
rough, incomplete estimates re
ported to the FPC already add up
to nearly 600,000 put out of work
for some period of time during
the past week by natural gas
shortages.
It's possible that different
pipelines serving overlapping
areas may be inadvertently re
porting the same layoffs twice,
but on the other hand the total
comes from estimates by only
five out of the 29 biggest
pipelines so there must be many
more that have not been counted
yet.
It seems fair to say at least half
a million workers have been
idled so far.
Q. Why can't those plants burn
oil or something ? Is there a shor
tage of that, too?

A. No, the FEA says there
plenty of fuel oil, but soi
plants can only use gas for c
tain industrial processes wh
others simply do not ha
standby oil burners. To nu
matters worse, some plants t
could burn fuel oil can't ge
because the cold weather l
frozen rivers and lakes, hamp
ing deliveries by barges.
Q. How did the natural gas sh
tage develop?
A. For one thing, oil compan
moved a lot of their drilling
the Middle East in the 19605, a
new gas is often discover
while drilling for oil, so gas c
coveries in the United States •
creased.
A more fundamental reasoi

there are fewer and fewer
them waiting to be foui
Meanwhile, the natural gas
dustry built up its ma r ket w
discount rates for large indi
rial users and advertising

Since about 1968, the Uni
States has simply been burn
up more gas than it finds ev
year, and siphoning off its
serves. That sort ofthi ng can'l

into shortages.
Q. What can be done about i
A. Petroleum companies wan
drill in new areas, especially
the seacoasts where the Intei
Department is auctioning leaf
