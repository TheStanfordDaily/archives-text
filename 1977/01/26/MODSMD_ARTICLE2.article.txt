# Senate confirms Bell despite controversy
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —The Senate on
Tuesday confirmed President Jimmy
Carter's nomination of Griffin Bell, an
Atlanta lawyer and former federal
judge, to be Attorney General. The vote
was 75 to 21.
Carter's selection to head the Justice
Department stirred more controversy
than any of Carter's other Cabinet ap
pointments and the Senate vote was
preceeded by more than six hours of at
times acrimonious debate.
Republican opponents contended
the Democratic majority was not ap
plying the same standards to Bell that
they would have had he been the
nominee of a GOP president. Some of
them also raised questions of
"cronyism because of Carter's long
time friendship with Bell.
But most of the debate over Bell cen
tered around his civil rights record, an
issue emphasized by blacks and liberal
organizations who opposed his nomi-

nation. Carter has called Bell's civil
rights record "superb."
Bell will take his oath of office in a
ceremony at the Justice Department
today, a White House spokesman said.
Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) said
six days of hearings by the Senate
Judiciary Committee left "great gaps"
in the record. He moved to send the
nomination back to the committee for
further hearings. The Senate rejected
his motion by a vote of 70 to 25.
Earlier Brooke had clashed sharply
with Sen. Birch B.tyh (D-Ind.) who led
the floor fight for Bell's confirmation.
The two liberal senators usually are
allied on civil rights issues but this
time they were on opposite sides.
Brooke was among Republican
senators who suggested that if Bell
were the nominee of a Republican
president, he would be rejected by the
heavily Democratic Senate.
Bayh denied Democrats were

"rubber-stamping" the Atlanta
lawyer because he was the nominee of
a Democratic president and at one
point accused Brooke of demagoguery.
Brooke protested and asked for an
apology. Bayh said he had made the
remark inadvertently, "in the heat of
passion."
Bell, 58. served on the sth U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for nearly 15
years by appointment of John Kennedy
and has been described by Carter as the
best-qualified person he could find to
head the Justice Dapartment.
But at hearings held by the Senate
Juciciery Committee, his nomination
drew strong opposition from the Na
tional Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People, the Congres
sional Black Caucus, Americans for
Democratic Action and other civil
rights and liberal organizations.
Brooke, the Senate's only black, cal
led the six days of hearings held by the
Judiciary panel "pro forma and per
functory" and said additional witnes
ses should have been summoned in an
effort to get all the facts about Bell's
record.
The committee voted 10 to 3 to re
commend Senate confirmation, with
all the dissenting votes cast by Repub
licans.

record.
The committee voted 10 to 3 to re
commend Senate confirmation, with
all the dissenting votes cast by Repub
licans.
Washington (AP) —The Senate on
Tuesday confirmed President Jimmy
Carter's nomination of Griffin Bell, an
Atlanta lawyer and former federal
judge, to be Attorney General. The vote
was 75 to 21.
Carter's selection to head the Justice
Department stirred more controversy
than any of Carter's other Cabinet ap
pointments and the Senate vote was
preceeded by more than six hours of at
times acrimonious debate.
Republican opponents contended
the Democratic majority was not ap
plying the same standards to Bell that
they would have had he been the
nominee of a GOP president. Some of
them also raised questions of
"cronyism because of Carter's long
time friendship with Bell.
But most of the debate over Bell cen
tered around his civil rights record, an
issue emphasized by blacks and liberal
organizations who opposed his nomi-

nation. Carter has called Bell's civil
rights record "superb."
Bell will take his oath of office in a
ceremony at the Justice Department
today, a White House spokesman said.
Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) said
six days of hearings by the Senate
Judiciary Committee left "great gaps"
in the record. He moved to send the
nomination back to the committee for
further hearings. The Senate rejected
his motion by a vote of 70 to 25.
Earlier Brooke had clashed sharply
with Sen. Birch B.tyh (D-Ind.) who led
the floor fight for Bell's confirmation.
The two liberal senators usually are
allied on civil rights issues but this
time they were on opposite sides.
Brooke was among Republican
senators who suggested that if Bell
were the nominee of a Republican
president, he would be rejected by the
heavily Democratic Senate.
Bayh denied Democrats were

"rubber-stamping" the Atlanta
lawyer because he was the nominee of
a Democratic president and at one
point accused Brooke of demagoguery.
Brooke protested and asked for an
apology. Bayh said he had made the
remark inadvertently, "in the heat of
passion."
Bell, 58. served on the sth U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for nearly 15
years by appointment of John Kennedy
and has been described by Carter as the
best-qualified person he could find to
head the Justice Dapartment.
But at hearings held by the Senate
Juciciery Committee, his nomination
drew strong opposition from the Na
tional Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People, the Congres
sional Black Caucus, Americans for
Democratic Action and other civil
rights and liberal organizations.
Brooke, the Senate's only black, cal
led the six days of hearings held by the
Judiciary panel "pro forma and per
functory" and said additional witnes
ses should have been summoned in an
effort to get all the facts about Bell's
record.
