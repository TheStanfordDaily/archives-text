# UCD study reveals voters misunderstood 'yes' on 15
## 
### 
Davis(AP) —California voters
defeated the nuclear power
plants initiative by 2-1 at the
polls last June, and it could have
been even more of a landslide
because many voted yes when
they meant to vote no, a study
says.
More than 12 per cent of the
voters who responded to a sur
vey by researchers at the Univer
sity of California here indicated
they voted incorrectly on Prop.

15.
The ballot measure would
have required nuclear plant
operators to meet safety stan
dards set by the legislature and
waive liability limits. Other
wise, new plants could not be
built and old ones would have
been restricted or phased out.
It was worded so that those
wanting mandated guidelines
for nuclear development voted
yes, and those who did not voted
no.
"In a close race, these 'misun
derstoods' might have caused
the proposition to win even
though it was not a reflection of
voter attitude," said Alexander
(iroth and Howard Schutz, pro
fessors who conducted the sur
vey and wrote a 55-page report.
They received 633 responses
from 1000 voters in Sacramento
County, where Prop. 15 trailed
3-2.
Eighty-one people, or 12.8 per
cent, said they misunderstood
the ves-no proposition.
Oi those. 72 per cent said they

voted yes when they meant to
vote no, and 2H per cent voted no
when they favored mandated
guidelines.
The survey also found that
women, Democrats who backed
Gov. Edmund Brown |r. and
young voters cast most votes in
favor of Prop. 15.
Of those who voted for Hrown
in the presidential primary. 59
per cent voted yes on Prop. 15.
Forty-six per cent of the voters
for limmy Carter also voted yes.
