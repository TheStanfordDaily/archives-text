## 'Rugby players are the Scrum of the Earth' Stanford hosts Bay Area Touring Side in biggest match of the season 
### 
Tacked up on rugger Chuck Nelson's
door are the words "Give Blood, Play
Rugby." The famed bumper stickers of the
sport say, "Rugby Players are the Scrum of
the Earth," and"It Takes Leather Balls to
play Rugby.
"To be a good rugby player," said Nel
son, "you've got to be able to play with
bruises and bangs."
Rugby is a physical sport with cleets and
mouthpieces about the only equipment a
player uses.
"There are a lot more injuries in rugby
than football," Nelson said. "But they are
usually scrapes and scratches. Shins take
a beating but there aren't knee injuries as in
football because there is no blocking in
rugby."
Teammate Mike Thurman said proudly
revealing his scabby bruised knees,
"Rugby is undisciplined hitting - it's freer

than football."
Football middle linebacker Gordy Cere
si no said he played rugby in high school but
won't play at Stanford because it is too
rough. And Ceresino is no meek Pac-8
linebacker!
But the Cards don't think the sport is
dangerous. Thurman called rugby a
"fraternity on the field." Nelson enjoys the
comraderie and the kegs of beer after the
game.
"We get together after the game and
there is always a lot of singing," he said.
"Loud rasty songs," Thurman explained.
"At one of the parties, one guy started to
strip," Nelson said.
Today at 3:30 the Cards take on the Bay
Area Touring Side (BATS), one of the na
tion's top teams. Stanford alumni on the
team include Jerry Robinson, Kip Oxman,
Gordy Riegel and Doug Single.
