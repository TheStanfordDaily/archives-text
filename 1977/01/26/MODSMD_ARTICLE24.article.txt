Volleyball
In its first competition of the
season, the Stanford volleyball
team jumped into southern
California action last weekend,
meeting nine teams in three
days.
The Cards, predictably, fell to
six-time national champions
UCLA (15-9, 15-6, 15-5) Friday
night, but displayed a good per
formance the next two days to
garner seventh place (of 22
teams) in the UC-Santa Barbara
Invitational Tournament.
"We were cold going against
UCLA," said assistant coach
Steve Dougherty, who noted that
the Bruins havebeen involved in

weekly competition since the
academic year began. "Starting
your season opener against the
NCAA champions isn't the
easiest thing to do."
After the UCLA loss however,
the Cards demonstrated their
previous night's lacking poten
tial. In Saturday's competition,
Stanford spikers took seven of
eight games to win their pool
and advance to higher competi
tion.
Sunday produced a 3-5 overall
game score with the Cards hand
ily defeating a tough California
team 15-7, 15-9.
Stanford makes its home
debut Saturday, when the Cards
host Humboldt State in Maples

Pavilion at 2 p.m.
Wrestling
After posting two wins in a
double-dual meet last Saturday,
Stanford's wrestling team has a
busy slate this week.
Tomorrow the Cards travel to
Stanislaus State for a double
dual match against Stanislaus
State and Cal Lutheran at 5 p.m.
Saturday the grapplers will
compete in the San Francisco
State tournament.

son has been named to the
Academic All-America football
