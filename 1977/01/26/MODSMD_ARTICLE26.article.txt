# Cardinals open 2-game road trip
## 
### David Georgette 
Dick Dißiaso's Cardinal ca
pers, 9-18 on the year and 1-3 in
Pacific-8 play, continue their
mid-season break from confer
ence competition when they fly
to Colorado today to face the Air
Force Academy Falcons (4-11)
tomorrow night.
Saturday Stanford takes on the
Utah State Aggies in Logan.
KZSU will broadcast both
games, with tip-off tomorrow at
6:45 (PST).
"This week has always been
reserved for the rival game," said
Dißiaso referring to the past two
seasons when Cal and Stanford
met during this part of the sea
son. "This year the game was al
ready scheduled then (at the end
of the year) and I couldn't
change it,"he said.
"I sort of like the opening,"
Dißiaso said. However, he added
that next year there will proba
bly be no break in conference ac
tion because of the new Pac-10
alignment.
Emotional
Commenting on the Cards'
performance so far this season,
Dißiaso said, "The team is play
ing with a great deal of emotion
and determination. The players
have had to overcome a lot of
adversity to be successful."
Some of the adversity came in
the form of a foot injury to start
ing forward Jay Carter. The
junior, averaging 10.4 points
and seven rebounds a contest, is
expected to see some playing
time on the road trip.
On the Cards' last visit to the
Rockies, Dißiaso's team finished
thoif successful string of holiday
games with an 83-76 victory over
Colorado State.
Apparently, the high eleva
tions do not bother the Cards.
The heights of the Falcons
should not concern the Cards too
much, either, because the Air
Force has no players listed on its
roster over 6-foot-8, and only
two over 6-6.
Tight defense
Air Force six-year head coach
Hank Egan tries to make up for
the lack of size with emphasis on
tight defensive basketball. The
Falcons have given up an aver

age of a little over 60 points a
game the past couple of seasons.
Dißiaso said the Falcons have
been "very successful in control
ling the tempo. Air Force is an
excellent, aggressive defensive
team. They run a disciplined,
ball-control offense."
He cited the play of Falcon
forward Tom Schneeberger, cal
ling the junior "a good shooter
and an aggressive rebounder."
Schneeberger is averaging 17.3
points and nearly 10 rebounds a
game. Cuard Bob Djokovich is
Air Force's second leading
scorer at 11.9 points a name.
Over in Ogden, the Aggies
have gotten an average crowd of
almost 8000 fans a game during
the past five years. "Utah State is
very successful at home," said
Dißiaso. Over the last three years
Utah State has a 35-4 record at
home.
Dißiaso said the Aggies are an
"up and down" team, having
encountered hard times on the
road while winning at home.
Dutchman
The independent Aggies'
fourth-year head coach, Dutch
Bel nap, stresses a balanced and
quick style of play this year to try
to combat the difficulties inex
perience can bring.
Even with seven returning let
termen, seven of the 12 Aggie
players are freshmen or sopho
mores.
Junior 6-8 frontliner MikeSan
tos is one of the key players for
Utah State. He is averaging 17.6
points and 10.2 rebounds per
game.
Santos is supported by for
ward Blair Martineau and guard
Darryl Owens, who are averag
ing 14.4 and 13 points a game,
respectively.
