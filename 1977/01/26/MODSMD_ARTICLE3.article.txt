# SLAC official advises parity with USSR

### Lindsey How 
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
gave policy recommendations on na
tional security and arms control to the
new Senate Committee on Foreign Re
lations last Wednesday.
Speaking as a private citizen, Drell
said that the U.S. should work to re
duce the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, but still maintain a nuclear
force equivalent to that of the Soviet
Union.
The U.S.'s nuclear weapons are not
for the purpose of nuclear attack, but to
dissuade the Soviet Union or any other
nation from launching a nuclear at
tack. Drell said. A second strike capa
bility insures that the U.S. will be able
to retaliate against a nuclear attack.
"The strategic forces of the United
States are immensely powerful," he
said. "The Soviet Union has no edge,
let alone advantage in their overall
strategic forces."
While U.S. missile development has
neither the intensity or scope of Soviet
efforts, he said, "The U.S., with its lead
in technology, presently has very
many more deployed MIRV's (multi
ple independently targeted reentry
vehicles) and is pursuing highly
sophisticated accuracy programs."
Slight edge unimportant
However, since the outcome of a
nuclear conflict would result in de
struction of both sides, a slight edge is
unimportant, said Drell.
The United States and the Soviet
Union have the opportunity to act as
leaders in deterrence of proliferation
of nuclear weapons, Dresll added. The
survival of mankind as will remain
precarious in a world with over
stocked nuclear arsenals.
The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT) area beginning step in thegoal
of reduction of nuclear weapons, Drell
said. However, the danger of nuclear
weapons is not in their accumulation
but in their use. He said he feels there
is less chance of their use now because
ofSALT than in 1962, when the Cuban
•missile crisis occurred.
Stable deterrence
He listed six conditions that he said
the Senate should consider in for
mulating a policy of stable deterrence
between the Soviet Union and the Un
ited States.
Among these conditions is clear
evidence neither country seeks
strategic superiority. A rough overall
equivalence of forces is necessary, but
an insistence on strict equality in each
individual weapon category would
serve no useful purpose, said Drell.
Any surveillance of equipment by the
opposing side would need to be so de
tailed that neither side would agree to
such a search, he said.
Drell said the U.S. was already de
termining missile development in hos
tile countries by the National Techni
cal Means (N'TM), a system of satel
lites. He said NTM was a verifiable
way of enforcing limited arms control,
since missile testing cannot be hidden
from satellites.
Who strikes first?
A country with forces inferior to the
other side's would be threatened by
prospects of a first strike from the op
ponent. and would be placed under
tension to launch its own system be-
fore the actual strike of the other side.
The solution to this situation, said
Drell, is a mix of strategic forces de
signed so that a large faction of each
side will survive the first attack.
Secure and effective command and
control of one's nuclear forces is
necessary to avoid accidental nuclear
launch. The maintenance of strong
conventional forces is important to
give effective non-nuclear military op
tions for meeting national security
commitments, he added.
The idea of limited nuclear wars in
an attempt to limit casualties is in
valid, Drell said, adding that Secretary
of Defense-designate Harold Brown
agrees with that belief. In a nuclear
attack, however limited, civilian death
would number in the millions. Drell
said. The possibility also remains that
retaliation of the other side would not
be limited in scope to military sites.

but in their use. He said he feels there
is less chance of their use now because
ofSALT than in 1962, when the Cuban
•missile crisis occurred.
Stable deterrence
He listed six conditions that he said
the Senate should consider in for
mulating a policy of stable deterrence
between the Soviet Union and the Un
ited States.
Among these conditions is clear
evidence neither country seeks
strategic superiority. A rough overall
equivalence of forces is necessary, but
an insistence on strict equality in each
individual weapon category would
serve no useful purpose, said Drell.
Any surveillance of equipment by the
opposing side would need to be so de
tailed that neither side would agree to
such a search, he said.
Drell said the U.S. was already de
termining missile development in hos
tile countries by the National Techni
cal Means (N'TM), a system of satel
lites. He said NTM was a verifiable
way of enforcing limited arms control,
since missile testing cannot be hidden
from satellites.
Who strikes first?
A country with forces inferior to the
other side's would be threatened by
prospects of a first strike from the op
ponent. and would be placed under
tension to launch its own system be-
fore the actual strike of the other side.
The solution to this situation, said
Drell, is a mix of strategic forces de
signed so that a large faction of each
side will survive the first attack.
Secure and effective command and
control of one's nuclear forces is
necessary to avoid accidental nuclear
launch. The maintenance of strong
conventional forces is important to
give effective non-nuclear military op
tions for meeting national security
commitments, he added.
The idea of limited nuclear wars in
an attempt to limit casualties is in
valid, Drell said, adding that Secretary
of Defense-designate Harold Brown
agrees with that belief. In a nuclear
attack, however limited, civilian death
would number in the millions. Drell
said. The possibility also remains that
retaliation of the other side would not
be limited in scope to military sites.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
gave policy recommendations on na
tional security and arms control to the
new Senate Committee on Foreign Re
lations last Wednesday.
Speaking as a private citizen, Drell
said that the U.S. should work to re
duce the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, but still maintain a nuclear
force equivalent to that of the Soviet
Union.
The U.S.'s nuclear weapons are not
for the purpose of nuclear attack, but to
dissuade the Soviet Union or any other
nation from launching a nuclear at
tack. Drell said. A second strike capa
bility insures that the U.S. will be able
to retaliate against a nuclear attack.
"The strategic forces of the United
States are immensely powerful," he
said. "The Soviet Union has no edge,
let alone advantage in their overall
strategic forces."
While U.S. missile development has
neither the intensity or scope of Soviet
efforts, he said, "The U.S., with its lead
in technology, presently has very
many more deployed MIRV's (multi
ple independently targeted reentry
vehicles) and is pursuing highly
sophisticated accuracy programs."
Slight edge unimportant
However, since the outcome of a
nuclear conflict would result in de
struction of both sides, a slight edge is
unimportant, said Drell.
The United States and the Soviet
Union have the opportunity to act as
leaders in deterrence of proliferation
of nuclear weapons, Dresll added. The
survival of mankind as will remain
precarious in a world with over
stocked nuclear arsenals.
The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT) area beginning step in thegoal
of reduction of nuclear weapons, Drell
said. However, the danger of nuclear
weapons is not in their accumulation
but in their use. He said he feels there

ofSALT than in 1962, when the Cuban
•missile crisis occurred.
