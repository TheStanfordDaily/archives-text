# Building a women's cage program
## Mc Crea faces tough job 
### Jeff Wahba 
"Don't get the wrong impres
sion, I'm not really that mean but
they needed it today," first-year
women's basketball coach Dotty
McCrea apologized after closing
last Monday afternoon's basket
ball practice.
There were a lot of things to be
upset about. She had just wit
nessed two players, far from the
ball, go crashing into each other
and fall to the ground.
Several times during the final
eight minute scrimmage it was
necessary to scream, "You've
done the same mistake three or
four times in a row now." And
neither the red or white squads
were able to score more than two
baskets in the game.
But McCrea was not discour
aged. This is the challenge she
has been looking for — to build a
top women's basketball prog
ram.
Good record
McCrea, a native of Matawan,
N.J., in the heart of women's
basketball, has the credentials to
do it. She played on the U.S.
Womens National Team in 1973
and barely missed making the
Olympic team last year.
Her coaching career includes
an assistant coaching job at Im
maculata College — one of the
nation's top women's basketball
schools.
Comparing the Immaculata's
program to Stanford's is a tall or
der. "Basketball has a special
importance at Immaculata and
they do an excellent job of re
cruiting. They have a lot of
built-in advantages; the high
school programs in their area are
very good, they are able to attract
good players because they are
known for their program, and
they are also able to subsidize
their players to some extent,"
she said.
But in spite of the Eastern
dominance, including the Rut
gers program where McCrea
coached last year, she was wil
ling to take a stab at women's
basketball on the West Coast
which is still "several notches
below the East."
At Rutgers 1 thought my per
formance would largely be the
outcome of how well I recruited
and not because of my abilities
as a coach," McCrea said.
Coaching ability
"Here, because there aren't the
talent rich high school prog
rams, building the Stanford
program will be a reflection of

my ability as a coach.
"Also, Dick Dißiaso gave me a
really positive attitude of what
he envisioned the program to
be," McCrea said. Some schools
have token women's basketball
teams because of the Title IX
regulation. But I got the impres
sion that Stanford really wanted
to build a strong women's bas
ketball team and I've been given
the support to do that,"" McCrea
explained.
After fall practice and seven
games, McCrea realizes that a lot
must still be done to build a top
program. "Our goal this year is
just to get our opponents to be
lieve they are going to have to
work to beat us," she said.
League crown
"It would be nice to win a
league championship but that
will probably have to wait,"
especially since the Cardinals
have dropped their first three
league games.
Every year the women's squad
has been termed a young team by
whoever their present coach
happens to be and McCrea
doesn't hesitate to use this adjec
tive.
"I think in past years the squad
has lost some of it's soph mores
and juniors just because they

were tired of the program or we
ren't getting anything out of it."
McCrea said.
"My goal is to build a program
here the women and community
will he proud of. This will keep
the varsity players from losing
interest. With a good program it
should be no problem," she in
sisted.
Frosh domination
The challenge is ahead of her
si nee t wo-t hi rds of her roster are
freshmen and sophmores.
But McCrea is also using bas
ketball camps and clinics to
build a strong program here.
"I'm associated with the
largest basketball camp organi
zation in the country and visit
many schools in the area giving
clinics. I think this is probably
the best way of getting the Stan
ford program known," McCrea
said.
"By trying to improve the high
school programs in the Bay Area
I'll eventually have a close base
to recruit from."
"Also I was able to hire Sue
Rojcewicz (a member of the 1970
Olympic team) as an assistant
and her addition will not only
benefit the team coaching-wise,
but in attracting high school
seniors as well."
