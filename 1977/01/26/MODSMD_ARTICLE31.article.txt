Nixon challenges control of tapes
Washington — Richard Nixon's lawyers
asked the Supreme Court yesterday to strike
down a three-year-old law that gives the gov
ernment control of the former chief executive's
presidential papers and tape recordings.
A legal brief filed with the high court said
Nixon had been unfairly singled out as an unre
liable custodian of the materials, which include
the Watergate tapes.
The law challenged by Nixon's lawyers in a
series of court fights applies only to Nixon's
papers and tapes.
It would eventually provide for public access
to the materials. There is one proposal for allow
ing any interested person to hear some of the
Watergate tapes.
The 500 hours of tape recordings are the result
of Nixon's decision to secretly record hundreds
of telephone and White House Oval Office con
versations.
The law, passed three months after Nixon's
resignation from the White House, allows him to
recover private and personal materials.
But in their brief the Nixon lawyers com
plained that government archivists and not
Nixon would decide what is private.
Kelley plans to stay until 1978
Washington — FBI Director Clarence Kelley
plans to retire after another 11 months in office,
it was disclosed yesterday.
In a letter to Atty. Cen.-designate Criffin Bell,
Kelley said, "I intend to remain as FBI director
until Jan. 1, 1978 at which time I will retire."
During this period, Kelley said, "I hope pro
cedures will be devised to choose my successor
and I will assist in this process in order that a
smooth transition is effected."
The Justice Department released the letter,
dated Monday, shortly after Sen. John Danforth
of Missouri said he had learned of Kelley's plan
to retire by the end of the year.
It he remains in office through October he
becomes eligible for a considerable pension in
crease. He became director in July 1973.
The disclosure that Kelley planned to retire
came as the Senate prepared to vote on Bell's
nomination. The nomination was approved la
ter.
A new federal law sets a 10-year term for the
FBI director. But there are legal questions about
whether a president could replace an FBI direc
tor who had served less than 10 years if he chose
to do so.
Kelley said he was spelling out his intentions
because he thought it would be a good idea to
clear up the confusion.
Bell's statements during Senate committee
hearings earlier this month caused some uncer
tainty about what he had in mind for Kelley.
At one point. Bell said Kelley would be re
placed "before too long," but he later said he did
not intend to fire Kelley.
Carter may propose tax rebate
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's $31
billion economic program may include a $50
cash payment for nearly every American, in

cluding the non-taxpaying poor, Bert Lance,
Carter's budget director, said yesterday.
Lance said the payments would be in the form
of a tax rebate for each personal exemption
claimed by taxpayers for 1976. There also would
be a cash payment for persons receiving Social
Security benefits and for low-income persons
who do not pay taxes.
Lance said Carter has also decided to ask Con
gress to encourage business investment by rais
ing the investment tax credit to 12 per cent from
10 per cent.
However, some liberal Democrats and the
AFL-CIO criticized Carter's emphasis and said
they would try to shift the focus of the legislative
package to job creation and minimize the tax
relief.
Congressional leaders who met with Carter at
the White House quoted the president as saying
that his is "the best way" to stimulate the
economy. Rep. John Brademas, the House major
ity whip, said Carter pledged "to meet Congress
more than half way" in the quest for action on
his programs.
Lance told reporters it may not be possible to
provide payments to all the poor, especially
those with incomes below $4000, because it
could cost nearly as much in administrative
costs to reach them as the amount of the pay
ments themselves.
VP optimistic after Schmidt talk
Bonn, West Germany — Vice President Wal
ter Mondale said his four-hour meeting yester
day with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt had enhanced chances for a "coopera
tive solution" to U.S.-German differences over
the spread of nuclear technology.
But at a news conference after the meeting, the
two men sidestepped direct comment on a con
troversia' German plan to sell nuclear technol
ogy to Brazil, calling the deal a "sensitive ques
tion."
The meeting also dealt with economic topics,
and Mondale said Schmidt had agreed on the
need for international economic stimulation.
Asked whether Bonn would proceed with the
Brazilian nuclear deal, Schmidt said: "Just as the
Federal Republic of Germany has so far fulfilled
the agreements it entered into along with their
contractual obligations, it will do so in the fu
ture."
But, he said, "This does not exclude addi
tional contractual obligations being entered into
in this field in the future."
He did not elaborate. But German reports said
the Bonn government, under pressure from
Washington, is considering ways to drop sensi
tive aspects of the deal while retaining lucrative
reactor contracts.
Besides reactors, the $4 billion deal involves
uranium enrichment and fuel processing
facilities that could be used to convert used nuc
lear fuel into plutonium usable in atomic
weapons.
Portillo offers diplomatic services
Mexico City — President Jose Lopez Portillo of
Mexico says he is willing to serve as a bridge
builder to help the United States improve its

relations with the rest of Latin America.
"It would give me great pleasure to be a vehi
cle for harmony," he said in an interview with
the Associated Press.
Portillo, who is scheduled to meet with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in Washington next month,
also indicated a willingness to assist the United
States in resolving its disputes with Panama and
Cuba.
Lopez Portillo was one of eight Latin Ameri
can chiefs of state who last week urged the Un
ited States to reach a prompt solution of its dis
pute with Panama over the Panama Canal.
Lopez Portillo, who took office Dec. 1, said he
attaches great importance for Mexico to his
Washington visit.
"For better or for worse the solution to many
domestic problems passes through
Washington,"he added.
He described as "absolutely true" Carter's in
augural address remark that many of his deci
sions as president would inevitably affect mill
ions of people in other countries.
Asked if the Cuban and Panamanian issues are
part of his Washington agenda, the Mexican
president said that the agenda has not yet been
completed.
Court rejects integration plan
Washington — The Supreme Court, again in
dicating that it wants federal judges to apply
more stringent tests before ordering widespread
school desegregation, barred yesterday the
court-ordered plan to integrate schools in In
dianapolis.
The justices voted 6-3 to strike down a federal
judge's desegregation order, upheld by the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that would have
required the busing of about 10,000 black stu
dents.
The case was sent back to the appeals court
with instructions to re-examine the facts in light
of two recent Supreme Court rulings which, in
effect, make it more difficult to prove racial dis
crimination.
In those earlier cases, the court moved to es
tablish an "intent" test for racial discrimination.
Under that test, the court has said it's not enough
to show that blacks are adversely affected more
than whites. Rather, the court said it is necessary
to show that the parties being charged with dis
crimination actually intended to do so.
In the past, the court also has had reservations
about how far federal judges can go to alleviate
racial discrimination.
The court last month set aside an integration
order for Austin, Tex., public schools. Speaking
in a concurring opinion then. Justice Louis Pow
ell Jr. said remedies have to fit the type of segre
gation in effect.
Powell took a dim view, as the court had in
past decisions, on inter-district remedies when
discrimination was not proved to exist in all the
districts affected.
Violence, arrests continue in Spain
Madrin — Police arrested more than 60 per
sons yesterday in an effort to stem rising politi
cal violence that has left six dead. But new dis
orders were feared as angry leftists took to the

streets to demand vengeance for rightist vio
lence.
More than 35,000 workers walked off their
jobs in Madrid and some 30.000 struck the Bar
celona SEAT plant, Spain's largest automobile
factory, to protest the machine-gun killing of
four Communists by gunmen presumed to be
right-wing extremists.
Leftists in Madrid called for a general strike
today.
Premier Adolfo Suarez called in top military
and civilian cabinet members to discuss the vio
lence, which included the country's second
major political kidnapping in less than two
months.
Police reportedly arrested 24 persons, includ
ing 19 foreigners, in the hunt for gunmen who
burst into offices used by Communist labor
lawyers Monday night. The killers shot four per
sons fatally and wounded five others. News
paper funeral notices identified the dead as
three lawyers and a worker, all members of the
illegal Communist party.
Some 500 demonstrators protested outside the
hospital where one of the lawyers died. Inside,
50 hospital employes struck to protest the kil
lings.
The slayings came a few hours after the abduc
tion of Lt. Gen. Emilio Villaescusa, president of
the Supreme Court of Military Justice. Police
picked up more than 40 persons for questioning
in the kidnapping but reported no clues.
Negotiations unlikely in Zambia
Lusaka — Cuban advisers are training guerril
las for the war against Rhodesia's white minority
regime, black nationalist sources here said yes
terday as prospects dimmed for a negotiated
peace in the racially torn country.
In Rhodesia, the mood of whites ranged from
jubilant to fearful yesterday, a day after Prime
Minister Ian Smith rejected a new British peace
plan for transition to black majority rule.
White Rhodesian officials have expressed
concern in recent months that Cuban troops
based in Angola might enter the four-year-old
Rhodesian war in some way. An estimated
12,000 to 15,000 Cuban troops remained in An
gola after helping a Marxist-oriented group win
a civil war and take power last year in the former
Portuguese colony.
The nationalist sources here said Cubans are
training members of the Zimbabwe People's
Army, the military arm of the Patriotic Front of
black nationalists Joshua Nkomo and Robert
Mugabe. Zimbabwe is the black nationalists'
name for Rhodesia.
In rejecting the latest British peace proposals
on Monday, Smith said they would have led to
an immediate surrender of power to a "Marxist
indoctrinated minority" of black nationalists.

based in Angola might enter the four-year-old
Rhodesian war in some way. An estimated
12,000 to 15,000 Cuban troops remained in An
gola after helping a Marxist-oriented group win
a civil war and take power last year in the former
Portuguese colony.
The nationalist sources here said Cubans are
training members of the Zimbabwe People's
Army, the military arm of the Patriotic Front of
black nationalists Joshua Nkomo and Robert
Mugabe. Zimbabwe is the black nationalists'
name for Rhodesia.
In rejecting the latest British peace proposals
on Monday, Smith said they would have led to
an immediate surrender of power to a "Marxist
indoctrinated minority" of black nationalists.

Nixon challenges control of tapes
Washington — Richard Nixon's lawyers
asked the Supreme Court yesterday to strike
down a three-year-old law that gives the gov
ernment control of the former chief executive's
presidential papers and tape recordings.
A legal brief filed with the high court said
Nixon had been unfairly singled out as an unre
liable custodian of the materials, which include
the Watergate tapes.
The law challenged by Nixon's lawyers in a
series of court fights applies only to Nixon's
papers and tapes.
It would eventually provide for public access
to the materials. There is one proposal for allow
ing any interested person to hear some of the
Watergate tapes.
The 500 hours of tape recordings are the result
of Nixon's decision to secretly record hundreds
of telephone and White House Oval Office con
versations.
The law, passed three months after Nixon's
resignation from the White House, allows him to
recover private and personal materials.
But in their brief the Nixon lawyers com
plained that government archivists and not
Nixon would decide what is private.
Kelley plans to stay until 1978
Washington — FBI Director Clarence Kelley
plans to retire after another 11 months in office,
it was disclosed yesterday.
In a letter to Atty. Cen.-designate Criffin Bell,
Kelley said, "I intend to remain as FBI director
until Jan. 1, 1978 at which time I will retire."
During this period, Kelley said, "I hope pro
cedures will be devised to choose my successor
and I will assist in this process in order that a
smooth transition is effected."
The Justice Department released the letter,
dated Monday, shortly after Sen. John Danforth
of Missouri said he had learned of Kelley's plan
to retire by the end of the year.
It he remains in office through October he
becomes eligible for a considerable pension in
crease. He became director in July 1973.
The disclosure that Kelley planned to retire
came as the Senate prepared to vote on Bell's
nomination. The nomination was approved la
ter.
A new federal law sets a 10-year term for the
FBI director. But there are legal questions about
whether a president could replace an FBI direc
tor who had served less than 10 years if he chose
to do so.
Kelley said he was spelling out his intentions
because he thought it would be a good idea to
clear up the confusion.
Bell's statements during Senate committee
hearings earlier this month caused some uncer
tainty about what he had in mind for Kelley.
At one point. Bell said Kelley would be re
placed "before too long," but he later said he did
not intend to fire Kelley.
Carter may propose tax rebate
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's $31
billion economic program may include a $50
cash payment for nearly every American, in

cluding the non-taxpaying poor, Bert Lance,
Carter's budget director, said yesterday.
Lance said the payments would be in the form
of a tax rebate for each personal exemption
claimed by taxpayers for 1976. There also would
be a cash payment for persons receiving Social
Security benefits and for low-income persons
who do not pay taxes.
Lance said Carter has also decided to ask Con
gress to encourage business investment by rais
ing the investment tax credit to 12 per cent from
10 per cent.
However, some liberal Democrats and the
AFL-CIO criticized Carter's emphasis and said
they would try to shift the focus of the legislative
package to job creation and minimize the tax
relief.
Congressional leaders who met with Carter at
the White House quoted the president as saying
that his is "the best way" to stimulate the
economy. Rep. John Brademas, the House major
ity whip, said Carter pledged "to meet Congress
more than half way" in the quest for action on
his programs.
Lance told reporters it may not be possible to
provide payments to all the poor, especially
those with incomes below $4000, because it
could cost nearly as much in administrative
costs to reach them as the amount of the pay
ments themselves.
VP optimistic after Schmidt talk
Bonn, West Germany — Vice President Wal
ter Mondale said his four-hour meeting yester
day with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt had enhanced chances for a "coopera
tive solution" to U.S.-German differences over
the spread of nuclear technology.
But at a news conference after the meeting, the
two men sidestepped direct comment on a con
troversia' German plan to sell nuclear technol
ogy to Brazil, calling the deal a "sensitive ques
tion."
The meeting also dealt with economic topics,
and Mondale said Schmidt had agreed on the
need for international economic stimulation.
Asked whether Bonn would proceed with the
Brazilian nuclear deal, Schmidt said: "Just as the
Federal Republic of Germany has so far fulfilled
the agreements it entered into along with their
contractual obligations, it will do so in the fu
ture."
But, he said, "This does not exclude addi
tional contractual obligations being entered into
in this field in the future."
He did not elaborate. But German reports said
the Bonn government, under pressure from
Washington, is considering ways to drop sensi
tive aspects of the deal while retaining lucrative
reactor contracts.
Besides reactors, the $4 billion deal involves
uranium enrichment and fuel processing
facilities that could be used to convert used nuc
lear fuel into plutonium usable in atomic
weapons.
Portillo offers diplomatic services
Mexico City — President Jose Lopez Portillo of
Mexico says he is willing to serve as a bridge
builder to help the United States improve its

relations with the rest of Latin America.
"It would give me great pleasure to be a vehi
cle for harmony," he said in an interview with
the Associated Press.
Portillo, who is scheduled to meet with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in Washington next month,
also indicated a willingness to assist the United
States in resolving its disputes with Panama and
Cuba.
Lopez Portillo was one of eight Latin Ameri
can chiefs of state who last week urged the Un
ited States to reach a prompt solution of its dis
pute with Panama over the Panama Canal.
Lopez Portillo, who took office Dec. 1, said he
attaches great importance for Mexico to his
Washington visit.
"For better or for worse the solution to many
domestic problems passes through
Washington,"he added.
He described as "absolutely true" Carter's in
augural address remark that many of his deci
sions as president would inevitably affect mill
ions of people in other countries.
Asked if the Cuban and Panamanian issues are
part of his Washington agenda, the Mexican
president said that the agenda has not yet been
completed.
Court rejects integration plan
Washington — The Supreme Court, again in
dicating that it wants federal judges to apply
more stringent tests before ordering widespread
school desegregation, barred yesterday the
court-ordered plan to integrate schools in In
dianapolis.
The justices voted 6-3 to strike down a federal
judge's desegregation order, upheld by the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that would have
required the busing of about 10,000 black stu
dents.
The case was sent back to the appeals court
with instructions to re-examine the facts in light
of two recent Supreme Court rulings which, in
effect, make it more difficult to prove racial dis
crimination.
In those earlier cases, the court moved to es
tablish an "intent" test for racial discrimination.
Under that test, the court has said it's not enough
to show that blacks are adversely affected more
than whites. Rather, the court said it is necessary
to show that the parties being charged with dis
crimination actually intended to do so.
In the past, the court also has had reservations
about how far federal judges can go to alleviate
racial discrimination.
The court last month set aside an integration
order for Austin, Tex., public schools. Speaking
in a concurring opinion then. Justice Louis Pow
ell Jr. said remedies have to fit the type of segre
gation in effect.
Powell took a dim view, as the court had in
past decisions, on inter-district remedies when
discrimination was not proved to exist in all the
districts affected.
Violence, arrests continue in Spain
Madrin — Police arrested more than 60 per
sons yesterday in an effort to stem rising politi
cal violence that has left six dead. But new dis
orders were feared as angry leftists took to the

streets to demand vengeance for rightist vio
lence.
More than 35,000 workers walked off their
jobs in Madrid and some 30.000 struck the Bar
celona SEAT plant, Spain's largest automobile
factory, to protest the machine-gun killing of
four Communists by gunmen presumed to be
right-wing extremists.
Leftists in Madrid called for a general strike
today.
Premier Adolfo Suarez called in top military
and civilian cabinet members to discuss the vio
lence, which included the country's second
major political kidnapping in less than two
months.
Police reportedly arrested 24 persons, includ
ing 19 foreigners, in the hunt for gunmen who
burst into offices used by Communist labor
lawyers Monday night. The killers shot four per
sons fatally and wounded five others. News
paper funeral notices identified the dead as
three lawyers and a worker, all members of the
illegal Communist party.
Some 500 demonstrators protested outside the
hospital where one of the lawyers died. Inside,
50 hospital employes struck to protest the kil
lings.
The slayings came a few hours after the abduc
tion of Lt. Gen. Emilio Villaescusa, president of
the Supreme Court of Military Justice. Police
picked up more than 40 persons for questioning
in the kidnapping but reported no clues.
Negotiations unlikely in Zambia
Lusaka — Cuban advisers are training guerril
las for the war against Rhodesia's white minority
regime, black nationalist sources here said yes
terday as prospects dimmed for a negotiated
peace in the racially torn country.
In Rhodesia, the mood of whites ranged from
jubilant to fearful yesterday, a day after Prime
Minister Ian Smith rejected a new British peace
plan for transition to black majority rule.
White Rhodesian officials have expressed
concern in recent months that Cuban troops
based in Angola might enter the four-year-old

lawyers Monday night. The killers shot four per
sons fatally and wounded five others. News
paper funeral notices identified the dead as
three lawyers and a worker, all members of the
illegal Communist party.
Some 500 demonstrators protested outside the
hospital where one of the lawyers died. Inside,
50 hospital employes struck to protest the kil

The slayings came a few hours after the abduc

the Supreme Court of Military Justice. Police
picked up more than 40 persons for questioning
in the kidnapping but reported no clues.
Negotiations unlikely in Zambia
Lusaka — Cuban advisers are training guerril
las for the war against Rhodesia's white minority
regime, black nationalist sources here said yes
terday as prospects dimmed for a negotiated
peace in the racially torn country.
In Rhodesia, the mood of whites ranged from
jubilant to fearful yesterday, a day after Prime
Minister Ian Smith rejected a new British peace
plan for transition to black majority rule.
White Rhodesian officials have expressed
concern in recent months that Cuban troops
based in Angola might enter the four-year-old
Rhodesian war in some way. An estimated
12,000 to 15,000 Cuban troops remained in An
gola after helping a Marxist-oriented group win
a civil war and take power last year in the former
Portuguese colony.
The nationalist sources here said Cubans are
training members of the Zimbabwe People's
Army, the military arm of the Patriotic Front of
black nationalists Joshua Nkomo and Robert
Mugabe. Zimbabwe is the black nationalists'
name for Rhodesia.
In rejecting the latest British peace proposals
on Monday, Smith said they would have led to
an immediate surrender of power to a "Marxist
indoctrinated minority" of black nationalists.

Nixon challenges control of tapes
Washington — Richard Nixon's lawyers
asked the Supreme Court yesterday to strike
down a three-year-old law that gives the gov
ernment control of the former chief executive's
presidential papers and tape recordings.
A legal brief filed with the high court said
Nixon had been unfairly singled out as an unre
liable custodian of the materials, which include
the Watergate tapes.
The law challenged by Nixon's lawyers in a
series of court fights applies only to Nixon's
papers and tapes.
It would eventually provide for public access
to the materials. There is one proposal for allow
ing any interested person to hear some of the
Watergate tapes.
The 500 hours of tape recordings are the result
of Nixon's decision to secretly record hundreds
of telephone and White House Oval Office con
versations.
The law, passed three months after Nixon's
resignation from the White House, allows him to
recover private and personal materials.
But in their brief the Nixon lawyers com
plained that government archivists and not
Nixon would decide what is private.
Kelley plans to stay until 1978
Washington — FBI Director Clarence Kelley
plans to retire after another 11 months in office,
it was disclosed yesterday.
In a letter to Atty. Cen.-designate Criffin Bell,
Kelley said, "I intend to remain as FBI director
until Jan. 1, 1978 at which time I will retire."
During this period, Kelley said, "I hope pro
cedures will be devised to choose my successor
and I will assist in this process in order that a
smooth transition is effected."
The Justice Department released the letter,
dated Monday, shortly after Sen. John Danforth
of Missouri said he had learned of Kelley's plan
to retire by the end of the year.
It he remains in office through October he
becomes eligible for a considerable pension in
crease. He became director in July 1973.
The disclosure that Kelley planned to retire
came as the Senate prepared to vote on Bell's
nomination. The nomination was approved la
ter.
A new federal law sets a 10-year term for the
FBI director. But there are legal questions about
whether a president could replace an FBI direc
tor who had served less than 10 years if he chose
to do so.
Kelley said he was spelling out his intentions
because he thought it would be a good idea to
clear up the confusion.
Bell's statements during Senate committee
hearings earlier this month caused some uncer
tainty about what he had in mind for Kelley.
At one point. Bell said Kelley would be re
placed "before too long," but he later said he did
not intend to fire Kelley.
Carter may propose tax rebate
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's $31
billion economic program may include a $50
cash payment for nearly every American, in

cluding the non-taxpaying poor, Bert Lance,
Carter's budget director, said yesterday.
Lance said the payments would be in the form
of a tax rebate for each personal exemption
claimed by taxpayers for 1976. There also would
be a cash payment for persons receiving Social
Security benefits and for low-income persons
who do not pay taxes.
Lance said Carter has also decided to ask Con
gress to encourage business investment by rais
ing the investment tax credit to 12 per cent from
10 per cent.
However, some liberal Democrats and the
AFL-CIO criticized Carter's emphasis and said
they would try to shift the focus of the legislative
package to job creation and minimize the tax
relief.
Congressional leaders who met with Carter at
the White House quoted the president as saying
that his is "the best way" to stimulate the
economy. Rep. John Brademas, the House major
ity whip, said Carter pledged "to meet Congress
more than half way" in the quest for action on
his programs.
Lance told reporters it may not be possible to
provide payments to all the poor, especially
those with incomes below $4000, because it
could cost nearly as much in administrative
costs to reach them as the amount of the pay
ments themselves.
VP optimistic after Schmidt talk
Bonn, West Germany — Vice President Wal
ter Mondale said his four-hour meeting yester
day with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt had enhanced chances for a "coopera
tive solution" to U.S.-German differences over
the spread of nuclear technology.
But at a news conference after the meeting, the
two men sidestepped direct comment on a con
troversia' German plan to sell nuclear technol
ogy to Brazil, calling the deal a "sensitive ques
tion."
The meeting also dealt with economic topics,
and Mondale said Schmidt had agreed on the
need for international economic stimulation.
Asked whether Bonn would proceed with the
Brazilian nuclear deal, Schmidt said: "Just as the
Federal Republic of Germany has so far fulfilled
the agreements it entered into along with their
contractual obligations, it will do so in the fu
ture."
But, he said, "This does not exclude addi
tional contractual obligations being entered into
in this field in the future."
He did not elaborate. But German reports said
the Bonn government, under pressure from
Washington, is considering ways to drop sensi
tive aspects of the deal while retaining lucrative
reactor contracts.
Besides reactors, the $4 billion deal involves
uranium enrichment and fuel processing
facilities that could be used to convert used nuc
lear fuel into plutonium usable in atomic
weapons.
Portillo offers diplomatic services
Mexico City — President Jose Lopez Portillo of
Mexico says he is willing to serve as a bridge
builder to help the United States improve its

relations with the rest of Latin America.
"It would give me great pleasure to be a vehi
cle for harmony," he said in an interview with
the Associated Press.
Portillo, who is scheduled to meet with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in Washington next month,
also indicated a willingness to assist the United
States in resolving its disputes with Panama and
Cuba.
Lopez Portillo was one of eight Latin Ameri
can chiefs of state who last week urged the Un
ited States to reach a prompt solution of its dis
pute with Panama over the Panama Canal.
Lopez Portillo, who took office Dec. 1, said he
attaches great importance for Mexico to his
Washington visit.
"For better or for worse the solution to many
domestic problems passes through
Washington,"he added.
He described as "absolutely true" Carter's in
augural address remark that many of his deci
sions as president would inevitably affect mill
ions of people in other countries.
Asked if the Cuban and Panamanian issues are
part of his Washington agenda, the Mexican
president said that the agenda has not yet been
completed.
Court rejects integration plan
Washington — The Supreme Court, again in
dicating that it wants federal judges to apply
more stringent tests before ordering widespread
school desegregation, barred yesterday the
court-ordered plan to integrate schools in In
dianapolis.
The justices voted 6-3 to strike down a federal
judge's desegregation order, upheld by the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that would have
required the busing of about 10,000 black stu
dents.
The case was sent back to the appeals court
with instructions to re-examine the facts in light
of two recent Supreme Court rulings which, in
effect, make it more difficult to prove racial dis
crimination.
In those earlier cases, the court moved to es
tablish an "intent" test for racial discrimination.
Under that test, the court has said it's not enough
to show that blacks are adversely affected more
than whites. Rather, the court said it is necessary
to show that the parties being charged with dis
crimination actually intended to do so.
In the past, the court also has had reservations
about how far federal judges can go to alleviate
racial discrimination.
The court last month set aside an integration
order for Austin, Tex., public schools. Speaking
in a concurring opinion then. Justice Louis Pow
ell Jr. said remedies have to fit the type of segre
gation in effect.
Powell took a dim view, as the court had in
past decisions, on inter-district remedies when
discrimination was not proved to exist in all the
districts affected.
Violence, arrests continue in Spain
Madrin — Police arrested more than 60 per
sons yesterday in an effort to stem rising politi
cal violence that has left six dead. But new dis
orders were feared as angry leftists took to the

streets to demand vengeance for rightist vio
lence.
More than 35,000 workers walked off their
jobs in Madrid and some 30.000 struck the Bar
celona SEAT plant, Spain's largest automobile
factory, to protest the machine-gun killing of
four Communists by gunmen presumed to be
right-wing extremists.
Leftists in Madrid called for a general strike
today.
Premier Adolfo Suarez called in top military
and civilian cabinet members to discuss the vio
lence, which included the country's second
major political kidnapping in less than two
months.
Police reportedly arrested 24 persons, includ
ing 19 foreigners, in the hunt for gunmen who
burst into offices used by Communist labor
lawyers Monday night. The killers shot four per
sons fatally and wounded five others. News

Violence, arrests continue in Spain
Madrin — Police arrested more than 60 per
sons yesterday in an effort to stem rising politi
cal violence that has left six dead. But new dis
orders were feared as angry leftists took to the

streets to demand vengeance for rightist vio
lence.
More than 35,000 workers walked off their
jobs in Madrid and some 30.000 struck the Bar
celona SEAT plant, Spain's largest automobile
factory, to protest the machine-gun killing of
four Communists by gunmen presumed to be
right-wing extremists.
Leftists in Madrid called for a general strike
today.
Premier Adolfo Suarez called in top military
and civilian cabinet members to discuss the vio
lence, which included the country's second
major political kidnapping in less than two
months.
Police reportedly arrested 24 persons, includ
ing 19 foreigners, in the hunt for gunmen who
burst into offices used by Communist labor
lawyers Monday night. The killers shot four per
sons fatally and wounded five others. News
paper funeral notices identified the dead as
three lawyers and a worker, all members of the
illegal Communist party.
Some 500 demonstrators protested outside the
hospital where one of the lawyers died. Inside,
50 hospital employes struck to protest the kil
lings.
The slayings came a few hours after the abduc
tion of Lt. Gen. Emilio Villaescusa, president of
the Supreme Court of Military Justice. Police
picked up more than 40 persons for questioning
in the kidnapping but reported no clues.
Negotiations unlikely in Zambia
Lusaka — Cuban advisers are training guerril
las for the war against Rhodesia's white minority
regime, black nationalist sources here said yes
terday as prospects dimmed for a negotiated
peace in the racially torn country.
In Rhodesia, the mood of whites ranged from
jubilant to fearful yesterday, a day after Prime
Minister Ian Smith rejected a new British peace
plan for transition to black majority rule.
White Rhodesian officials have expressed
concern in recent months that Cuban troops
based in Angola might enter the four-year-old
Rhodesian war in some way. An estimated
12,000 to 15,000 Cuban troops remained in An
gola after helping a Marxist-oriented group win
a civil war and take power last year in the former
Portuguese colony.
The nationalist sources here said Cubans are
training members of the Zimbabwe People's
Army, the military arm of the Patriotic Front of
black nationalists Joshua Nkomo and Robert
Mugabe. Zimbabwe is the black nationalists'
name for Rhodesia.
In rejecting the latest British peace proposals
on Monday, Smith said they would have led to
an immediate surrender of power to a "Marxist
indoctrinated minority" of black nationalists.

Nixon challenges control of tapes
Washington — Richard Nixon's lawyers
asked the Supreme Court yesterday to strike
down a three-year-old law that gives the gov
ernment control of the former chief executive's
presidential papers and tape recordings.
A legal brief filed with the high court said
Nixon had been unfairly singled out as an unre
liable custodian of the materials, which include
the Watergate tapes.
The law challenged by Nixon's lawyers in a
series of court fights applies only to Nixon's
papers and tapes.
It would eventually provide for public access
to the materials. There is one proposal for allow
ing any interested person to hear some of the
Watergate tapes.
The 500 hours of tape recordings are the result
of Nixon's decision to secretly record hundreds
of telephone and White House Oval Office con
versations.
The law, passed three months after Nixon's
resignation from the White House, allows him to
recover private and personal materials.
But in their brief the Nixon lawyers com
plained that government archivists and not
Nixon would decide what is private.
Kelley plans to stay until 1978
Washington — FBI Director Clarence Kelley
plans to retire after another 11 months in office,
it was disclosed yesterday.
In a letter to Atty. Cen.-designate Criffin Bell,
Kelley said, "I intend to remain as FBI director
until Jan. 1, 1978 at which time I will retire."
During this period, Kelley said, "I hope pro
cedures will be devised to choose my successor
and I will assist in this process in order that a
smooth transition is effected."
The Justice Department released the letter,
dated Monday, shortly after Sen. John Danforth
of Missouri said he had learned of Kelley's plan
to retire by the end of the year.
It he remains in office through October he
becomes eligible for a considerable pension in
crease. He became director in July 1973.
The disclosure that Kelley planned to retire
came as the Senate prepared to vote on Bell's
nomination. The nomination was approved la
ter.
A new federal law sets a 10-year term for the
FBI director. But there are legal questions about
whether a president could replace an FBI direc
tor who had served less than 10 years if he chose
to do so.
Kelley said he was spelling out his intentions
because he thought it would be a good idea to
clear up the confusion.
Bell's statements during Senate committee
hearings earlier this month caused some uncer
tainty about what he had in mind for Kelley.
At one point. Bell said Kelley would be re
placed "before too long," but he later said he did
not intend to fire Kelley.
Carter may propose tax rebate
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's $31
billion economic program may include a $50
cash payment for nearly every American, in

cluding the non-taxpaying poor, Bert Lance,
Carter's budget director, said yesterday.
Lance said the payments would be in the form
of a tax rebate for each personal exemption
claimed by taxpayers for 1976. There also would
be a cash payment for persons receiving Social
Security benefits and for low-income persons
who do not pay taxes.
Lance said Carter has also decided to ask Con
gress to encourage business investment by rais
ing the investment tax credit to 12 per cent from
10 per cent.
However, some liberal Democrats and the
AFL-CIO criticized Carter's emphasis and said
they would try to shift the focus of the legislative
package to job creation and minimize the tax
relief.
Congressional leaders who met with Carter at
the White House quoted the president as saying
that his is "the best way" to stimulate the
economy. Rep. John Brademas, the House major
ity whip, said Carter pledged "to meet Congress
more than half way" in the quest for action on
his programs.
Lance told reporters it may not be possible to
provide payments to all the poor, especially
those with incomes below $4000, because it
could cost nearly as much in administrative
costs to reach them as the amount of the pay
ments themselves.
VP optimistic after Schmidt talk
Bonn, West Germany — Vice President Wal
ter Mondale said his four-hour meeting yester
day with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt had enhanced chances for a "coopera
tive solution" to U.S.-German differences over
the spread of nuclear technology.
But at a news conference after the meeting, the
two men sidestepped direct comment on a con
troversia' German plan to sell nuclear technol
ogy to Brazil, calling the deal a "sensitive ques
tion."
The meeting also dealt with economic topics,
and Mondale said Schmidt had agreed on the
need for international economic stimulation.
Asked whether Bonn would proceed with the
Brazilian nuclear deal, Schmidt said: "Just as the
Federal Republic of Germany has so far fulfilled
the agreements it entered into along with their
contractual obligations, it will do so in the fu
ture."
But, he said, "This does not exclude addi
tional contractual obligations being entered into
in this field in the future."
He did not elaborate. But German reports said
the Bonn government, under pressure from
Washington, is considering ways to drop sensi
tive aspects of the deal while retaining lucrative
reactor contracts.
Besides reactors, the $4 billion deal involves
uranium enrichment and fuel processing
facilities that could be used to convert used nuc
lear fuel into plutonium usable in atomic
weapons.
Portillo offers diplomatic services
Mexico City — President Jose Lopez Portillo of
Mexico says he is willing to serve as a bridge
builder to help the United States improve its

relations with the rest of Latin America.
"It would give me great pleasure to be a vehi
cle for harmony," he said in an interview with
the Associated Press.
Portillo, who is scheduled to meet with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in Washington next month,
also indicated a willingness to assist the United
States in resolving its disputes with Panama and
Cuba.
Lopez Portillo was one of eight Latin Ameri
can chiefs of state who last week urged the Un
ited States to reach a prompt solution of its dis
pute with Panama over the Panama Canal.
Lopez Portillo, who took office Dec. 1, said he
attaches great importance for Mexico to his
Washington visit.
"For better or for worse the solution to many
domestic problems passes through
Washington,"he added.
He described as "absolutely true" Carter's in
augural address remark that many of his deci
sions as president would inevitably affect mill
ions of people in other countries.
Asked if the Cuban and Panamanian issues are
part of his Washington agenda, the Mexican
president said that the agenda has not yet been
completed.
Court rejects integration plan
Washington — The Supreme Court, again in
dicating that it wants federal judges to apply
more stringent tests before ordering widespread
school desegregation, barred yesterday the
court-ordered plan to integrate schools in In
dianapolis.
The justices voted 6-3 to strike down a federal
judge's desegregation order, upheld by the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that would have
required the busing of about 10,000 black stu
dents.
The case was sent back to the appeals court
with instructions to re-examine the facts in light
of two recent Supreme Court rulings which, in
effect, make it more difficult to prove racial dis
crimination.
In those earlier cases, the court moved to es
tablish an "intent" test for racial discrimination.
Under that test, the court has said it's not enough
to show that blacks are adversely affected more
than whites. Rather, the court said it is necessary
to show that the parties being charged with dis
crimination actually intended to do so.
In the past, the court also has had reservations
about how far federal judges can go to alleviate
racial discrimination.
The court last month set aside an integration
order for Austin, Tex., public schools. Speaking
in a concurring opinion then. Justice Louis Pow
ell Jr. said remedies have to fit the type of segre
gation in effect.
Powell took a dim view, as the court had in
past decisions, on inter-district remedies when

judge's desegregation order, upheld by the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that would have
required the busing of about 10,000 black stu
dents.
The case was sent back to the appeals court
with instructions to re-examine the facts in light
of two recent Supreme Court rulings which, in
effect, make it more difficult to prove racial dis
crimination.
In those earlier cases, the court moved to es
tablish an "intent" test for racial discrimination.
Under that test, the court has said it's not enough
to show that blacks are adversely affected more
than whites. Rather, the court said it is necessary
to show that the parties being charged with dis
crimination actually intended to do so.
In the past, the court also has had reservations
about how far federal judges can go to alleviate
racial discrimination.
The court last month set aside an integration
order for Austin, Tex., public schools. Speaking
in a concurring opinion then. Justice Louis Pow
ell Jr. said remedies have to fit the type of segre
gation in effect.
Powell took a dim view, as the court had in
past decisions, on inter-district remedies when
discrimination was not proved to exist in all the
districts affected.
Violence, arrests continue in Spain
Madrin — Police arrested more than 60 per
sons yesterday in an effort to stem rising politi
cal violence that has left six dead. But new dis
orders were feared as angry leftists took to the

streets to demand vengeance for rightist vio
lence.
More than 35,000 workers walked off their
jobs in Madrid and some 30.000 struck the Bar
celona SEAT plant, Spain's largest automobile
factory, to protest the machine-gun killing of
four Communists by gunmen presumed to be
right-wing extremists.
Leftists in Madrid called for a general strike
today.
Premier Adolfo Suarez called in top military
and civilian cabinet members to discuss the vio
lence, which included the country's second
major political kidnapping in less than two
months.
Police reportedly arrested 24 persons, includ
ing 19 foreigners, in the hunt for gunmen who
burst into offices used by Communist labor
lawyers Monday night. The killers shot four per
sons fatally and wounded five others. News
paper funeral notices identified the dead as
three lawyers and a worker, all members of the
illegal Communist party.
Some 500 demonstrators protested outside the
hospital where one of the lawyers died. Inside,
50 hospital employes struck to protest the kil
lings.
The slayings came a few hours after the abduc
tion of Lt. Gen. Emilio Villaescusa, president of
the Supreme Court of Military Justice. Police
picked up more than 40 persons for questioning
in the kidnapping but reported no clues.
Negotiations unlikely in Zambia
Lusaka — Cuban advisers are training guerril
las for the war against Rhodesia's white minority
regime, black nationalist sources here said yes
terday as prospects dimmed for a negotiated
peace in the racially torn country.
In Rhodesia, the mood of whites ranged from
jubilant to fearful yesterday, a day after Prime
Minister Ian Smith rejected a new British peace
plan for transition to black majority rule.
White Rhodesian officials have expressed
concern in recent months that Cuban troops
based in Angola might enter the four-year-old
Rhodesian war in some way. An estimated
12,000 to 15,000 Cuban troops remained in An
gola after helping a Marxist-oriented group win
a civil war and take power last year in the former
Portuguese colony.
The nationalist sources here said Cubans are
training members of the Zimbabwe People's
Army, the military arm of the Patriotic Front of
black nationalists Joshua Nkomo and Robert
Mugabe. Zimbabwe is the black nationalists'
name for Rhodesia.
In rejecting the latest British peace proposals
on Monday, Smith said they would have led to
an immediate surrender of power to a "Marxist
indoctrinated minority" of black nationalists.

Nixon challenges control of tapes
Washington — Richard Nixon's lawyers
asked the Supreme Court yesterday to strike
down a three-year-old law that gives the gov
ernment control of the former chief executive's
presidential papers and tape recordings.
A legal brief filed with the high court said
Nixon had been unfairly singled out as an unre
liable custodian of the materials, which include
the Watergate tapes.
The law challenged by Nixon's lawyers in a
series of court fights applies only to Nixon's
papers and tapes.
It would eventually provide for public access
to the materials. There is one proposal for allow
ing any interested person to hear some of the
Watergate tapes.
The 500 hours of tape recordings are the result
of Nixon's decision to secretly record hundreds
of telephone and White House Oval Office con
versations.
The law, passed three months after Nixon's
resignation from the White House, allows him to
recover private and personal materials.
But in their brief the Nixon lawyers com
plained that government archivists and not
Nixon would decide what is private.
Kelley plans to stay until 1978
Washington — FBI Director Clarence Kelley
plans to retire after another 11 months in office,
it was disclosed yesterday.
In a letter to Atty. Cen.-designate Criffin Bell,
Kelley said, "I intend to remain as FBI director
until Jan. 1, 1978 at which time I will retire."
During this period, Kelley said, "I hope pro
cedures will be devised to choose my successor
and I will assist in this process in order that a
smooth transition is effected."
The Justice Department released the letter,
dated Monday, shortly after Sen. John Danforth
of Missouri said he had learned of Kelley's plan
to retire by the end of the year.
It he remains in office through October he
becomes eligible for a considerable pension in
crease. He became director in July 1973.
The disclosure that Kelley planned to retire
came as the Senate prepared to vote on Bell's
nomination. The nomination was approved la
ter.
A new federal law sets a 10-year term for the
FBI director. But there are legal questions about
whether a president could replace an FBI direc
tor who had served less than 10 years if he chose
to do so.
Kelley said he was spelling out his intentions
because he thought it would be a good idea to
clear up the confusion.
Bell's statements during Senate committee
hearings earlier this month caused some uncer
tainty about what he had in mind for Kelley.
At one point. Bell said Kelley would be re
placed "before too long," but he later said he did
not intend to fire Kelley.
Carter may propose tax rebate
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's $31
billion economic program may include a $50
cash payment for nearly every American, in

cluding the non-taxpaying poor, Bert Lance,
Carter's budget director, said yesterday.
Lance said the payments would be in the form
of a tax rebate for each personal exemption
claimed by taxpayers for 1976. There also would
be a cash payment for persons receiving Social
Security benefits and for low-income persons
who do not pay taxes.
Lance said Carter has also decided to ask Con
gress to encourage business investment by rais
ing the investment tax credit to 12 per cent from
10 per cent.
However, some liberal Democrats and the
AFL-CIO criticized Carter's emphasis and said
they would try to shift the focus of the legislative
package to job creation and minimize the tax
relief.
Congressional leaders who met with Carter at
the White House quoted the president as saying
that his is "the best way" to stimulate the
economy. Rep. John Brademas, the House major
ity whip, said Carter pledged "to meet Congress
more than half way" in the quest for action on
his programs.
Lance told reporters it may not be possible to
provide payments to all the poor, especially
those with incomes below $4000, because it
could cost nearly as much in administrative
costs to reach them as the amount of the pay
ments themselves.
VP optimistic after Schmidt talk
Bonn, West Germany — Vice President Wal
ter Mondale said his four-hour meeting yester
day with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt had enhanced chances for a "coopera
tive solution" to U.S.-German differences over
the spread of nuclear technology.
But at a news conference after the meeting, the
two men sidestepped direct comment on a con
troversia' German plan to sell nuclear technol
ogy to Brazil, calling the deal a "sensitive ques
tion."
The meeting also dealt with economic topics,
and Mondale said Schmidt had agreed on the
need for international economic stimulation.
Asked whether Bonn would proceed with the
Brazilian nuclear deal, Schmidt said: "Just as the
Federal Republic of Germany has so far fulfilled
the agreements it entered into along with their
contractual obligations, it will do so in the fu
ture."
But, he said, "This does not exclude addi
tional contractual obligations being entered into
in this field in the future."
He did not elaborate. But German reports said
the Bonn government, under pressure from
Washington, is considering ways to drop sensi
tive aspects of the deal while retaining lucrative
reactor contracts.
Besides reactors, the $4 billion deal involves
uranium enrichment and fuel processing
facilities that could be used to convert used nuc
lear fuel into plutonium usable in atomic
weapons.
Portillo offers diplomatic services
Mexico City — President Jose Lopez Portillo of
Mexico says he is willing to serve as a bridge
builder to help the United States improve its

relations with the rest of Latin America.
"It would give me great pleasure to be a vehi
cle for harmony," he said in an interview with
the Associated Press.
Portillo, who is scheduled to meet with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in Washington next month,
also indicated a willingness to assist the United
States in resolving its disputes with Panama and
Cuba.
Lopez Portillo was one of eight Latin Ameri
can chiefs of state who last week urged the Un
ited States to reach a prompt solution of its dis
pute with Panama over the Panama Canal.
Lopez Portillo, who took office Dec. 1, said he
attaches great importance for Mexico to his
Washington visit.
"For better or for worse the solution to many
domestic problems passes through
Washington,"he added.
He described as "absolutely true" Carter's in
augural address remark that many of his deci
sions as president would inevitably affect mill
ions of people in other countries.
Asked if the Cuban and Panamanian issues are
part of his Washington agenda, the Mexican
president said that the agenda has not yet been
completed.
Court rejects integration plan
Washington — The Supreme Court, again in
dicating that it wants federal judges to apply
more stringent tests before ordering widespread
school desegregation, barred yesterday the
court-ordered plan to integrate schools in In
dianapolis.
