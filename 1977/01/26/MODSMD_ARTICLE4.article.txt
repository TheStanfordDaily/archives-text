# Poor safety measures increase bike thefts 17%
## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
Despite consistently high bike theft
rates, the university has no plans to
replace theft-prone bike racks here, ac
cording to Associate Planner Steve
Schmidt.
Stanford Department of Public
Safety statistics reveal that 613 bikes
were stolen from campus last year, a 17
per cent increase from the 1975 theft
rate.
Public Safety Captain Raoul
Niemeyer blamed poorly locked bikes
and poorly designed racks for the
thefts. The currently used stone blocks
and linear racks make it difficult to
lock the bicycle properly: through
both wheels and the frame, to a statio-

nary object.
"Most bikes that were stolen were
locked only to themselves," said
Niemeyer. "Those things (stone
blocks) are worthless. They don't do
much more than stand up the bike.
You need to get the bike locked up
high so they (bike thieves) can't get
any leverage with bolt cutters. . . .
They should have more and better
racks throughout campus."
More secure racks
According to Schmidt, all new con
struction projects will have "Rack 3"
bike racks included with the build
ings. The Rack 3 consists of a metal bar
assembly in which metal prongs sec
ure the wheels and frame of the bicycle
and are then locked into place with a

padlock provided by the cyclist. A
Rack 3, which holds two bikes, costs
$83.50.
Niemeyer proposed installing sim
ple poles feet high with rings at
tached through wi.; r h a chain could be
fed to lock a bicycle. Such a rack would
be considerably cheaper â™¦he Rack
3, he pointed out.
Even with Rack 3s installed
newly constructed buildings, cyclists
will have to carry chains to lock their
bikes anywhere else on campus.
Nevertheless, Schmidt said he be
lieves the Rack 3 is a good investment.
)ust a padlock
"For the long term, the Rack 3 is
better. All you need is a padlock. If you
go off campus it's another matter.
People find a lot of alternates. You can
chain them to railings, benches and
trees," said Schmidt.
Chaining bikes to railings and to
other objects not intended for bikes has
been the cause of numerous accidents,
according to John Catania, manager of
grounds and contracts.
However, there is no budget for new
racks. Replacing lost or stolen racks is
"being considered," he said.
Niemeyer recommended using a
good case-hardened lock and chain to
secure bicycles, since most bike
thieves are juveniles and carry only
short bolt cutters in their pants or
under their jackets.
U-shaped bar
A solid U-shaped metal bar with a
locking device that fits through the
frame and one wheel of a bicycle is also
often recommended since it cannot be
cut with bolt cutters. In order for it to
be effective, however, a thin pole must
be available around which the bar can
be locked. Otherwise, the bike will be
locked solely to itself and can easily be
carried away.
One common tactic used by bike
thieves is to ride bicycles through
campus until they find a bike they
want. Then they park and lock their
bikes, steal the victim's bike and ride it
away, and then take a bus back to get
their own bikes, explained Niemeyer.
Another method often used is to
simply cart bikes away in a van.
They got away
"In another large-scale operation we
had three areas staked out. They were
coming in with trucks and taking
mostly bikes locked only to them
selves. They'd get six to eight in one
crack. We never caught these guys. We
had numerous stakeouts but it was a
matter of manpower constraints," said
Niemeyer.
Roble, Mirrilees, Toyon, and the
Chemistry and Biology buildings from
8 to 10 in the evening are especially

prone to bike theft, according to
Niemeyer.
Unlike Stanford, Palo Alto has
shown a steadily decreasing bike theft
rate over the past three years. Palo Alto
Police Lt. Chuck Hauser credited his
department with the decrease.
Palo Aito program
"We have a fairly aggressive bike
program, involving talks, licensings
a.">d citations. We will stop and check
bike.j A lot of citations were issued

(for vehicle code violations), but only
after we double-checked the owner
ship," said Hauser.
Once a bike is stolen, the chances of
recovery are not very good.
According to Hauser, "We are re
covering about 22 per cent of all stolen
and abandoned bikes. A lot hinges on
getting the theft reported and having
the bike licensed. Not all the bikes are
moved out of the area. A lot are just
moved in the local area."
