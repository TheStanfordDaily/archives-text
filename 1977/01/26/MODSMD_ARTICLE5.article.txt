# Survey shows blacks desire more progress
## 
### Marc Strassman 
The American black community is
not monolithic in its views but largely
remains unsatisfied with civil rights
progress, concluded Thomas Rhue,
former director of the African and
Afro-American Studies Program here,
from the first nationwide survey of
blacks by blacks.
Rhue presented his findings and
discussed the methodology of the sur
vey he conducted last year to a group
of around 25 in a lecture sponsored by
the African and Afro-American
Studies Program Office yesterday af
ternoon in Jordan Hall.
Rhue's survey involved a scientifi
cally selected sample of black resi
dents of the 16 American cities with
the largest black populations. Five
hundred and eighty-nine question
naires were returned out of 600
mailed.
In Rhue's survey, he found that re
spondents in the survey were in sub
stantia] agreement with a number of
black leaders about the most important
issues facing black Americans. These
issues, in descending order of impor
tance, were unemployment, educa
tion, crime and housing, Rhue said.
Getting worse?
The second major finding of his sur
vey, said Rhue, was that "66 per cent of
those sampled thought that conditions
of life for blacks were staying the same
or getting worse."
Another significant finding was that
40 per cent of those polled said they
thought that integration had had no
effect on race relations.
In addition, over 80 per cent of the
respondents, when asked whether
they thought that government efforts
on their behalf had been "too strong,
just about right, or too weak,"
answered "too weak" in the fields of
housing and jobs.
Education progress
Rhue said that among theblacks pol
led. the government had been judged
somewhat more favorably in educa
tion, with 60 per cent of those sur
veyed judging the government "too
weak" in that area.
Overall response to government ef
forts was more positive among re
spondents in the South, where. Rhue
said, the federal government had been
more active on behalf of blacks.
The cities from which samples were
drawn in the study were, in descend
ing order of black population: Los
Angeles, Dallas. Houston, New Or
leans, Atlanta, Washington. D.C., Bal
timore. Philadelphia, Newark. New
York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis
and St. Louis. The city with the na
tion's 16th largest black population.
Oakland, was used for pre-testing the
survey questions.
Rhue said that the survey's sample

was nationally representative since 18
per cent of those polled were un
employed or had no income.
Thirty-three per cent of those sur
veyed, he said, claimed to belong to no
church.
Among the methodological prob
lems cited by Rhue was discovering
that whole blocks containing people to
te polled had been "wiped away by
urban renewal."
Interviewer bias
Rhue discussed the bias that some
times enters into survey situations de
pending on whether the interviewer
and the interviewee are of the same or
different races.
There is no guarantee that blacks
will be completely honest with black
interviewers, Rhue said, but "blacks
have sometimes told whites a whole
lot of things."
Rhue recounted some of his more
interesting experiences in trying to
collect opinions. A woman in
Philadelphia who would not let him
into her bouse (old him before she sent
him away, that the issue she was most
interested in was sleep. A retired
woman sitting on a stoop in
Washington. D.C. refused to give him
any answers but wished him "good
luck" anyway. An interviewee in Los
Angeles wanted Rhue to put the inter
viewee's name on his answers and
send them directly to Jimmy Carter.
Devil
Rhue also reported a potential pollee
in Houston who screamed when !-he
saw him and told him that "you never
know what form the devil will take."
Her lengthy answers, Rhue explained,
were all expressed in terms of New
Testament theology. Her principal
political concept, Rhue reported, was
that "Jesus will take care of you."
Rhi-e concluded his talk with what
he called "by no means scientific"
generalizations that emerged from the
study.
In addition to the already mentioned
conclusion that black attitudes are of
"all kinds," he mentioned the follow
ing as major subjects of black concern:
—lack of national leadership;
—the continued existence of "tre
mendous poverty" among blacks, par
ticularly in the Northeast;
—crime.
Rhue said that he detected a "new
attitude of self-help, a feeling that we
need to do it ourselves," among the
blacks he surveyed.
He also said he found a "sense of
pride," an awareness that times and
conditions have at other times been
worse for black people."

Rhue discussed the bias that some
times enters into survey situations de
pending on whether the interviewer
and the interviewee are of the same or
different races.
There is no guarantee that blacks
will be completely honest with black
interviewers, Rhue said, but "blacks
have sometimes told whites a whole
lot of things."
Rhue recounted some of his more
interesting experiences in trying to
collect opinions. A woman in
Philadelphia who would not let him
into her bouse (old him before she sent
him away, that the issue she was most
interested in was sleep. A retired
woman sitting on a stoop in
Washington. D.C. refused to give him
any answers but wished him "good
luck" anyway. An interviewee in Los
Angeles wanted Rhue to put the inter
viewee's name on his answers and
send them directly to Jimmy Carter.
Devil
Rhue also reported a potential pollee
in Houston who screamed when !-he
saw him and told him that "you never
know what form the devil will take."
Her lengthy answers, Rhue explained,
were all expressed in terms of New
Testament theology. Her principal
political concept, Rhue reported, was
that "Jesus will take care of you."
Rhi-e concluded his talk with what
he called "by no means scientific"
generalizations that emerged from the
study.
In addition to the already mentioned
conclusion that black attitudes are of
"all kinds," he mentioned the follow
ing as major subjects of black concern:
—lack of national leadership;
—the continued existence of "tre
mendous poverty" among blacks, par
ticularly in the Northeast;
—crime.
Rhue said that he detected a "new
attitude of self-help, a feeling that we
need to do it ourselves," among the
blacks he surveyed.
He also said he found a "sense of
pride," an awareness that times and
conditions have at other times been
worse for black people."
The American black community is
not monolithic in its views but largely
remains unsatisfied with civil rights
progress, concluded Thomas Rhue,
former director of the African and
Afro-American Studies Program here,
from the first nationwide survey of
blacks by blacks.
Rhue presented his findings and
discussed the methodology of the sur
vey he conducted last year to a group
of around 25 in a lecture sponsored by
the African and Afro-American
Studies Program Office yesterday af
ternoon in Jordan Hall.
Rhue's survey involved a scientifi
cally selected sample of black resi
dents of the 16 American cities with
the largest black populations. Five
hundred and eighty-nine question
naires were returned out of 600
mailed.
In Rhue's survey, he found that re
spondents in the survey were in sub
stantia] agreement with a number of
black leaders about the most important
issues facing black Americans. These
issues, in descending order of impor
tance, were unemployment, educa
tion, crime and housing, Rhue said.
Getting worse?
The second major finding of his sur
vey, said Rhue, was that "66 per cent of
those sampled thought that conditions
of life for blacks were staying the same
or getting worse."
Another significant finding was that
40 per cent of those polled said they
thought that integration had had no
effect on race relations.
In addition, over 80 per cent of the
respondents, when asked whether
they thought that government efforts
on their behalf had been "too strong,
just about right, or too weak,"
answered "too weak" in the fields of
housing and jobs.
Education progress
Rhue said that among theblacks pol
led. the government had been judged
somewhat more favorably in educa
tion, with 60 per cent of those sur
veyed judging the government "too
weak" in that area.
Overall response to government ef
forts was more positive among re
spondents in the South, where. Rhue
said, the federal government had been
more active on behalf of blacks.
The cities from which samples were
drawn in the study were, in descend
ing order of black population: Los
Angeles, Dallas. Houston, New Or
leans, Atlanta, Washington. D.C., Bal
timore. Philadelphia, Newark. New
York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis
and St. Louis. The city with the na
tion's 16th largest black population.
Oakland, was used for pre-testing the
survey questions.
Rhue said that the survey's sample

was nationally representative since 18
per cent of those polled were un
employed or had no income.
Thirty-three per cent of those sur
veyed, he said, claimed to belong to no
church.
Among the methodological prob
lems cited by Rhue was discovering
that whole blocks containing people to
te polled had been "wiped away by
urban renewal."

The second major finding of his sur
vey, said Rhue, was that "66 per cent of
those sampled thought that conditions
of life for blacks were staying the same
or getting worse."
Another significant finding was that
40 per cent of those polled said they
thought that integration had had no
effect on race relations.
In addition, over 80 per cent of the
respondents, when asked whether
they thought that government efforts
on their behalf had been "too strong,
just about right, or too weak,"
answered "too weak" in the fields of
housing and jobs.
Education progress
Rhue said that among theblacks pol
led. the government had been judged
somewhat more favorably in educa
tion, with 60 per cent of those sur
veyed judging the government "too
weak" in that area.
Overall response to government ef
forts was more positive among re
spondents in the South, where. Rhue
said, the federal government had been
more active on behalf of blacks.
The cities from which samples were
drawn in the study were, in descend
ing order of black population: Los
Angeles, Dallas. Houston, New Or
leans, Atlanta, Washington. D.C., Bal
timore. Philadelphia, Newark. New
York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis
and St. Louis. The city with the na
tion's 16th largest black population.
Oakland, was used for pre-testing the
survey questions.
Rhue said that the survey's sample

was nationally representative since 18
per cent of those polled were un
employed or had no income.
Thirty-three per cent of those sur
veyed, he said, claimed to belong to no
church.
Among the methodological prob
lems cited by Rhue was discovering
that whole blocks containing people to
te polled had been "wiped away by
urban renewal."
Interviewer bias
Rhue discussed the bias that some
times enters into survey situations de
pending on whether the interviewer
and the interviewee are of the same or
different races.
There is no guarantee that blacks
will be completely honest with black
interviewers, Rhue said, but "blacks
have sometimes told whites a whole
lot of things."
Rhue recounted some of his more
interesting experiences in trying to
collect opinions. A woman in
Philadelphia who would not let him
into her bouse (old him before she sent
him away, that the issue she was most
interested in was sleep. A retired
woman sitting on a stoop in
Washington. D.C. refused to give him
any answers but wished him "good
luck" anyway. An interviewee in Los
Angeles wanted Rhue to put the inter
viewee's name on his answers and
send them directly to Jimmy Carter.
Devil
Rhue also reported a potential pollee
in Houston who screamed when !-he
saw him and told him that "you never
know what form the devil will take."
Her lengthy answers, Rhue explained,
were all expressed in terms of New
Testament theology. Her principal
political concept, Rhue reported, was
that "Jesus will take care of you."
Rhi-e concluded his talk with what
he called "by no means scientific"
generalizations that emerged from the
study.
In addition to the already mentioned
conclusion that black attitudes are of
"all kinds," he mentioned the follow
ing as major subjects of black concern:
—lack of national leadership;
—the continued existence of "tre
mendous poverty" among blacks, par
ticularly in the Northeast;
—crime.
Rhue said that he detected a "new
attitude of self-help, a feeling that we
need to do it ourselves," among the
blacks he surveyed.
He also said he found a "sense of
pride," an awareness that times and
conditions have at other times been
worse for black people."
