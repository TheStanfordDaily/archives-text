# Lyman views minority admissions
## 
### Karen Wada Staff writer 
President Richard Lyman said he prefers affirmative
action to minority admissions committees on KZSU's
Campus Conference last night.
He said minority applications hereare currently read by
staff members of the same race as the applicants. "A black
will probably read the black applications . . . but he won't
be the only one reading them." he said.
Presently, only the medical school has a special admis
sions committee, which Lyman said he would eliminate if
he had the power.
He explained that he does not have as much policy
making influence as people believe. University decisions
involve not just himself but deans, the Academic Senate,
and the student body.
Students on committees
"Students sit on all the standing committees here."
Lyman noted, adding that such participation is vital ex
cept in areas like proposed mandatory faculty evaluation,
an idea with which he is "sympathetic . . . with excep
tions."
"Students shouldn't try to keep up with established
scholars (in cases like this)." Lyman said. He said he
thought students should sit in as evaluators rather than as

members of tenure committees.
Lyman sidestepped a question on President jimmy Car
ter's pardoning of draft evaders. "Time will tell ... we
don't know yet if the rest of Carter's proposition will go
through. He hit the solution that antagonized a lot of
people."
Stressing its diversity, Lyman also praised under
graduate life here. He said differences in students' educa
tional backgrounds and goals, and their "lifestyles and
purposes in life" create a unique atmosphere which en
courages nonconformity and experimentation.
To gain the most from a Stanford education, Lyman told
students to take the initiative. "Those who don't ask much
don't get much."
Faculty members also need to go out of their way to "be
responsive . . . with varying degrees of success."
Athletic scholarships
Lyman defended his sponsorship of need-only NCAA
scholarships, saying universities spend too much money
on athletics. The problem is that not enough presidents
go to meetings. I don't mean presidents know any more
about it; they just are more objective.
"I don t blame athletic directors for trying to get as
much as they can Luckily, here, we have an athletic direc
tor who is for need-only scholarships."
