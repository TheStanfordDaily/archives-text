# Fire forces temporary closing of pizza place
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Frankie and Johnnie and Luigi Too,
the popular West Mountain View Ita
lian restaurant, will be closed until
Feb. 5 due to a small fire in a pizza
oven.
The fire, a result of "too many piz
zas" in the oven at once, caused $1000
worth of damage on Sunday night at
the restaurant, according to owner
Frank D'Ambrosio.
The restaurant will be closed until

Feb. 5, said D'Ambrosio, although the
repair work will only take about a day
and a half.
"We're going to let everyone take a
vacation and relax for a week," he said.
"We are going to rent the whole top
floor at the Sahara and go skiing," he
said, adding that he would pay for the
staff's accommodations.
D'Ambrosio said the fire was caused
indirectly, by adjustments that had
been made in the oven's heating con
trol system earlier that day.
Although the exterior appearance of
his place "may not be much," said
D'Ambrosio, he works hard to main
tain the efficiency of his kitchen. In
pursuit of that goal, he explained he
had called an experienced technician
to "calibrate the oven," around 1 p.m.
on Sunday, after which the oven began
to smolder.
Later that night, the oven overheated
because of overuse, which D'Ambrosio
didn't expect because he was used to
the way the oven worked before it was
recalibrated Sunday afternoon.
The overheated metal parts in the
oven made its wood components
smolder.
Around 8 p.m.. just as the smolder
ing wood began bursting into flame,
one of the cooks discovered it and put
the blaze out with a carbon dioxide
extinguisher.
The total damage, said D'Ambrosio,
was "not a heck of a lot; we'll have to
put in a new beam."
He said that the restaurant, which
was filled at the time to the legal limit
of fiH persons, was evacuated in an or
derly manner with no problems.
