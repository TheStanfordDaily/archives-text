## Problems on Iran contract 
### 
National Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT) is
withholding payment on a research contract
with the university. As a result, administrators
are faced with still more problems on a contract
which has been disruptive since it was signed
in winter 1975.
The contract's announcement resulted in
massive student protests in spring 1975, be
cause many believed the contract would result
in development of a satellite system to be used
for spying on Iranians.
Although present administration efforts to
recover the sum are laudable, the nonpayment
problem appears to have arisen partly because
of bureaucratic mistakes here.
The contract calls for a "Standby Letter of
Credit" which will "guarantee payment" by the
Iranians should something go wrong with the
primary payment system.
Yet no one responsible for administration of
research noticed Iran had never sent a letter of
credit of any sort. Presumably, the letter was
never issued. This inexcusable failure went
unnoticed until the university sought to invoke
the letter of credit.

Furthermore, no one appears to know how a
"Standby Letter of Credit" differs from conven
tional letters of credit. William Massy, vice
provost for research, said he is unable to define
the term, and local bankers say they have never
heard of such a means of payment.
The university is not entirely to blame for
nonpayment on the contract. However, major
changes must be made in methods of negotia
tion and administration of research contracts
here.
On overseas contracts, payment should be on
an irrevocable letter of credit basis only.
Under this system, contract recipients would
place money in an escrow account in a bank
and issue a letter to the university which allows
the university to tap the account as costs are
incurred.
For the NIRT contract, the university should
continue its efforts to recover the money owed.
Moreover, the "informal faculty group" look
ing into university performance on the NIRT
contract should quickly issue its report and
make that report public.
