# Gandhi serves capitalists

After 19 months of emergency rule,
Indira Gandhi's Jan. 18 announcement
of March parliamentary elections
came as a surprise to most observers.
But to decide if these elections can
succeed in permanently restoring
democratic rights in "the world's
largest democracy," it is necessary to
look at the social and economic condi
tions that led up to Gandhi's declara
tion of a state of emergency on June 26,
1975.
(Gandhi declared the emergency
after she was convicted June 12, 1975
of election fraud. The Indian Supreme
Court overturned this ruling after
Gandhi's Congress party majority in
parliament retroactively dissolved the
election fraud law.)
The most dismal aspect of India is its
poverty. India met independence in
1947 with an economy as backwards as
China's, yet 29 years of rule by the
Congress party, first led by Jawaharlal
Nehru and then by his daughter, Indira
Gandhi, have been unable to do any
thing to raise the standard of living.
Gandhi and the Congress party have
tried to avoid responsibility for India's
deteriorating conditions by demagog
ically posing as defenders of the poor
and claiming to be socialist. In reality
they represent the most powerful sec
tor of the Indian bourgeoisie.
This continuing poverty has led to
massive dissillusionment with the
Congress party. In January 1974, in
Gujurat state, student demonstrations
against inflation quickly led to large
demonstrations against food shortages
in the government-run ration shops.
The demands soon escalated to in
clude the ouster of the Congress par
ty's corrupt chief minister of the state
and the dissolution of the State Legis
lative Assembly. On Jan. 10. the state
capital of Ahmedabad was paralyzed
by a general strike. A successful
statewide general strike followed.
Killed more than 85
Gandhi responded by sending in
federal troops who killed more than 85
people. But the demonstrators con
tinued and by mid-March had forced
the resignation of the minister and dis
solution of the assembly.
This upheaval was unprecedented
in post-independence India, touching
virtually every city and town in the
state. Students in Buhar, one of India's
poorest states, followed the first pro
testers' example and on June 5,
500,000 people marched through the
state capital demanding dissolution of
the assembly.
Gandhi again sent troops who killed
over 80 people. She disclaimed re
sponsibility for the deaths by saying
the unrest was a "fascist" attempt to
stifle democracy.
As the unrest in Buhar developed,
the country was hit by a 20-day general
strike of railway workers in May of

1974, the first such strike since 1960.
Ghandhi broke the strike by arresting
tens of thousands of workers.
The unrest spread, resulting in a
demonstration of 100,000 in New
Delhi on Mar. 6, 1975. A coalition of
reformist and right-wing parties
emerged from these demonstrations
and won the Gujurat state election in
June 1975.
The Indian capitalists, a majority of
whom still supported the Congress
party, feared these parties would be
unable to control mass upsurges that
might emerge.
To prevent such a possibility, the
Indian capitalists supported Gandhi's
martial law. Support of the coup paid
off for the capitalists in the form of
reduced taxes and budget concessions
that will benefit the corporate sector to
the tune of 960 million rupees a year.
Almost all parties except the Con
gress party were banned.
According to the London-based
Committee for Justice for Indian Polit
ical Prisoners, there are now about
200,000 political prisoners.
73-page document
The International League for Human
Rights submitted a 73-page document
to the United Nations on June 1,1976,
listing hundreds of political prisoners
said to have been tortured by the Gan
dhi regime by beatings with steel rods
and rifle butts, the use of electric
shocks, burning with candles and
tying rods to prisoners' necks in order'
to strain the spinal cords.
The regime's use of terror was ex
tended to the poor layers of the popula
tion by launching "slum clearance"
and antibeggar drives.
The Associated Press reported on
Jan. 21 that although press censorship
has eased, "publication of news that
can cause public disorders," (such as
reports of inflation which touched off
the 1974 Gujurat demonstration) is
banned.
The general passivity of the Indian
people after the social unrest of 1974-
75, plus good monsoons which al
lowed stockpiling of grain and a cut in
inflation, along with concern for a
poor international image and the ex
pectation of a big Congress party vic
tory have made Gandhi decide to try
the parliamentary system again.
The Jan. 19 New York Times re
ported Gandhi as stating she would
"permit all legitimate activity neces
sary for recognized parties to put their
points of view before the people."
However, 26 political and religious
groups were banned during the
emergency, and it is not clear all of
these will be allowed to function.
Gandhi's statement on Jan. 18 that
she would tolerate no disruption indi
cates that a return to mass demonstra
tion and strikes (although public ral
lies supposedly will be allowed)

would be met once again by repression
and possibly a return to dictatorship.
But India's continuing social and
economic crisis, despite good
economic news recently, makes more
Gujurats certain.
As a capitalist politician, Gandhi's
need to put the profits of the capitalists
before the needs of the workers will
lead to the use of any means, including
a return to dictatorship, to beat back
the Indian people's demands for a de
cent standard of living.
