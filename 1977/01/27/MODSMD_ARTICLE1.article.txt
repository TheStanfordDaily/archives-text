### 
Washington (AP) — Bill Moyers, a
former top aide to President Lyndon
Johnson, is a frontrunner to be named
CIA director, sources said yesterday.
But President Jimmy Carter's spokes
man discouraged speculation about
the choice.
Moyers is out of the country at this
time, according to his employer CBS
News. A spokesman for CBS said that
Moyers .. has not been offered a job
in the Carter administration by the
president or anyone claiming to repre
sent the president. He is not contend
ing for any job."
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell had said Carter might an
nounce his choice for the job this
week. But he said last night, "1 don't
think you should definitely assume
there will be an announcement before
the end of this week. ..
Second choice
Moyers would be Carter's second
nominee to head the Central Intelli
gence Agency. Carter's first, Theodore
Sorensen, a former aide to President
John Kennedy, withdrew a week ago
Monday in the face of stiff Senate op

position.
Informed sources said Moyers is a
top contender for the CIA job. Moyers,
presently anchorman and chief repor
ter for CBS Reports, was not available
for comment. But an assistant said it
was pure "speculation" that he was a
top contender for the CIA.
Others mentioned for the job have

urity affairs, and retired Army Lt. Cen.
James Gavin.
Age a handicap

Moyers, 42, coveted an important
foreign policy advisory role during the
presidency of his original political
patron, Lyndon Baines Johnson.
However, Johnson chose to use him
as press secretary and all-purpose ad
viser. He had been deputy director of
the Peace Corps and became publisher
of Newsday on Long Island after leav
ing government.
Moyers joined the Public Broadcast

ing System in 1970 and was editor in
chief of Bill Moyer's Journal for five
years. He joined CBS in 1976.
It also was learned that the front
runner to become head of ACTION, the
umbrella federal agency for volunteer
groups such as the Peace Corps and
VISTA, is Sam Brown, state treasurer
in Colorado.
Brown, 33, was a war protester dur
ing the Vietnam years and an organizer
for Sen. Eugene McCarthy when he ran
for president. Brown would succeed
Michael Balzano.
A top contender to head the Vete
rans Administration is Max Cleland, a
paraplegic who lost both legs and an
arm in Vietnam combat as an Army
captain.
Cleland was a Georgia state senator
when Carter was governor. He spon
sored a resolution calling for with

former top aide to President Lyndon
Johnson, is a frontrunner to be named
CIA director, sources said yesterday.
But President Jimmy Carter's spokes
man discouraged speculation about
the choice.
Moyers is out of the country at this
time, according to his employer CBS
News. A spokesman for CBS said that
Moyers .. has not been offered a job
in the Carter administration by the
president or anyone claiming to repre
sent the president. He is not contend
ing for any job."
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell had said Carter might an
nounce his choice for the job this
week. But he said last night, "1 don't
think you should definitely assume
there will be an announcement before
the end of this week. ..
Second choice
Moyers would be Carter's second
nominee to head the Central Intelli
gence Agency. Carter's first, Theodore
Sorensen, a former aide to President
John Kennedy, withdrew a week ago
Monday in the face of stiff Senate op

position.
Informed sources said Moyers is a
top contender for the CIA job. Moyers,
presently anchorman and chief repor
ter for CBS Reports, was not available
for comment. But an assistant said it
was pure "speculation" that he was a
top contender for the CIA.
Others mentioned for the job have
included Paul Warnke, former assis
tant defense secretary for national sec
urity affairs, and retired Army Lt. Cen.
James Gavin.
Age a handicap
It was learned that Gavin, 70, who
was suggested to Carter by House
Speaker Thomas O'Neill is handicap
ped in the consideration by his age.
Moyers, 42, coveted an important
foreign policy advisory role during the
presidency of his original political
patron, Lyndon Baines Johnson.
However, Johnson chose to use him
as press secretary and all-purpose ad
viser. He had been deputy director of
the Peace Corps and became publisher
of Newsday on Long Island after leav
ing government.
Moyers joined the Public Broadcast

ing System in 1970 and was editor in
chief of Bill Moyer's Journal for five
years. He joined CBS in 1976.
It also was learned that the front
runner to become head of ACTION, the
umbrella federal agency for volunteer
groups such as the Peace Corps and
VISTA, is Sam Brown, state treasurer
in Colorado.
Brown, 33, was a war protester dur
ing the Vietnam years and an organizer
for Sen. Eugene McCarthy when he ran
for president. Brown would succeed
Michael Balzano.
A top contender to head the Vete
rans Administration is Max Cleland, a
paraplegic who lost both legs and an
arm in Vietnam combat as an Army
captain.
Cleland was a Georgia state senator
when Carter was governor. He spon
sored a resolution calling for with
drawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam.
