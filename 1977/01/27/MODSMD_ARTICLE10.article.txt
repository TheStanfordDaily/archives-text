In the various articles and commen
taries about the financial problems of
the Overseas Studies Program. I have
not been able to find any discussion of
what appears to me to be the major
issue. The current financial crises
stems from a decision made by some
one in the university administration
that the overseas campus office had to
reduce its budget by 50 per cent â€” at a
time when other departments were
supposed to make budget cuts of ap
proximately 15 per cent.
I have never seen in print nor been
given any satisfactory reason for this
rather large disparity in budget cuts. In
fact, it seems to me that there might be
convincing educational reasons for en
larging the Overseas Study Program
rather than reducing its size.
There are, of course, rumors floating
around that the "real reason" for the
cutbacks is the political weakness of
the overseas campus office in the uni
versity power structure (it has no de
partment to defend it). I invite com
ment from those individuals who
made the decision to reduce the over
seas campus budget and would espe
cially like to see a discussion of the
educational criteria used to make a de
cision which gives overseas study
sur.h a low priority at Stanford.
