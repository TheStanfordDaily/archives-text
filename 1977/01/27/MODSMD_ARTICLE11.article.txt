# Need for more black faculty, courses
## 
### 
On Nov. 18, 1968 — seven months
after Martin Luther King's assassina
tion and a little more than a year after
Stanford had begun to feel the pinch of
the nationwide "black studies move
ment," a rather important meeting of
the members of the Committee on the
Undergraduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies took place
here. Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs
presided over the meeting.
Together with student representa
tives, other faculty and staff members
present included Sanford Dornbusch,
Peter Duignan, G. Wesley Johnson,
Bruce Johnston, Martin Lowenkopf,
Patrick Manning and Hans Weiler. A
rare species now, black faculty at Stan
ford were all but nonexistent then.
Concerns
The minutes of that meeting indi
cate that a couple of matters were of
considerable concern to those in at
tendance: the need to increase black
faculty representation on campus and
the scarcity of courses related to as
pects of the "black experience." Here
are some passages from those minutes:
1 "The English Department has re
cently hired William Chace to teach
Afro-American literature (spring quar
ter), and is now looking for a specialist
in African literature."
2 "The Art Department is looking for
a faculty member interested in African
art."
3 "Professor Manning reported that
Professor Bertrand in the French De
partment has expressed an interest in
developing a course on French African
literature, if given time off from his
teaching duties to do so."
4 "Dr. Gibbs will send a memo to the
provost to ask him not to forget the
Sociology Department in the universi
ty's efforts to develop Afro-American
studies."
5 "It was also suggested that the
committee look into the possibility of
developing an introductory survey
course in Afro-American civilization
paralleling the African Civilizations
course. Presumably, such a course
would have been jointly taught by his
torians and anthropologists."
Need
An additional concern of the com
mittee was the need for someone, pref

erably an Afro-American, to teach
courses in the tremendously important
area of Afro-American politics.
It is interesting to note that, almost a
decade after the Nov. 18, 1968 meet
ing, there are still painfully obvious
deficiencies at this university in the
area of the recruitment of black faculty
and the development of black-related
courses. Moreover, the most glaring

deficiencies exist in precisely the areas
that were of such great concern a de
cade ago.
The English Department has never
hired anyone on a nontemporary basis
to teach African literature, though
there are a number of specialists in Af
rican literature around and courses in
this area are regularly offered at
numerous institutions that are not re
puted to be nearly as "hotshot" as
Stanford. In fact, many high schools
offer such courses.
With regard to the nontemporary fa
culty member in African art, appa
rently the Art Department is still look
ing .. .
By-product
Whatever the mystification, the fact
is that a by-product of Europe's expan
sion overseas has been the phenome
non of increasing numbers of non-
European peoples speaking European
languages. These non-Europeans—in
Asia, in Africa, in Latin America and
in the European and American met
ropoles — produce literature. To ig
nore the study of this literature in lan
guage classes (especially French,
Spanish and Portuguese) is to engage
not only in the business of building
language skills but also the business of
reproducing do facta racist ideology.
Encouragingly, the Spanish De
partment has offered a tenured posi

tion to a black woman who is in
terested in the literary expression of
various "underclasses" in the black
world. In certain other romance lan
guage departments, substantial de
ficiencies still exist. By the way, the
proposed course in French-African lit
erature never really got off the ground.
Persistent need
The Sociology Department has
managed, through the years, to obtain
black academics on various part-time
and short-term contracts. Nonetheless,
the need persists for black faculty (to
teach both traditional sociology
courses and black-related ones) and for
courses in the area of African and
Afro-American studies (e.g., in com
parative and historical sociology, ur
banism and the study of sociocultural
change).
Regarding the matter of anthropol
ogy courses on Afro-American
societies and culture, no such courses
presently exist here — in spite of the
fact that "Afro-American anthropol
ogy" (encompassing the United States,
Latin America and the Caribbean) is a
rapidly growing field of inquiry.
Though government agencies and
corporations — the folks who supply a
good deal of money to certain sectors
of this university — presently tend to
be more interested in Latin America
and Asia, for reasons having to do with
economic and politico-military
strategy, many students would wel
come courses and expertise in Afro-
American anthropology.
Still no courses
In spite of the large number of
Afro-American students who elect to
major in, and/or take courses in, politi
cal science, there are still no courses
here on Afro-American involvement
in the political arena. And there is not
a single black political scientist here
with a faculty position — a fact which
hardly makes it easy for the Political
Science Department to attract and
maintain good, black graduate stu

dents.
At Stanford, a development has oc
cured that was not foreseen a decade
ago: the tremendous increase in the
number of black undergraduate pre
meds. There is obviously a need for
black faculty members to offer coun
seling and advice (third world stu
dents often find it hard to establish
personal ties with white professors)
and to serve as role models.
There are a helluva lot of blacks with
Fh.D.s in the biological sciences.
A final word: obviously, the needs
this column has discussed are neither
all inclusive nor solely peculiar to the
black community. In these areas,
chicanos and native Americans have
fared no better. In some cases, they
have even fared worse.
If there are those who feel that this
university has "paid its dues" to the
Stanford third world community,
there are others who know better.

When submitted to the Daily, the
titlefor my column of Jan. 13,1977 was
"Racism and affirmative action," not
"Affirmative action can't reduce ra
cism." I have never argued, verbally or
in print, that affirmative action prog
rams serve no function in the eradica
tion of racism. Only an imbecile would
make such an argument.
In the column, "Hearst, Money and
the Law" Daily, Dec. 9, my position
was similarly distorted. Toward the
end of my version of the article, I
wrote: "Nor is it that the poor are never
'equal before the law' — just that, in
capitalist society, 'justice* is, in the
final analysis, a commodity."
When the column was printed, the
word "never" had been changed to
"ever" and the words "just that" had
been omitted. This change had the ef
fect of reducing part of my analysis to
the level of the absurd.

this area are regularly offered at
numerous institutions that are not re
puted to be nearly as "hotshot" as
Stanford. In fact, many high schools
offer such courses.
With regard to the nontemporary fa
culty member in African art, appa
rently the Art Department is still look

By-product
Whatever the mystification, the fact
is that a by-product of Europe's expan
sion overseas has been the phenome
non of increasing numbers of non-
European peoples speaking European
languages. These non-Europeans—in
Asia, in Africa, in Latin America and
in the European and American met
ropoles — produce literature. To ig
nore the study of this literature in lan
guage classes (especially French,
Spanish and Portuguese) is to engage
not only in the business of building
language skills but also the business of
reproducing do facta racist ideology.
Encouragingly, the Spanish De
partment has offered a tenured posi

tion to a black woman who is in
terested in the literary expression of
various "underclasses" in the black
world. In certain other romance lan
guage departments, substantial de
ficiencies still exist. By the way, the
proposed course in French-African lit
erature never really got off the ground.
Persistent need
The Sociology Department has
managed, through the years, to obtain
black academics on various part-time
and short-term contracts. Nonetheless,
the need persists for black faculty (to
teach both traditional sociology
courses and black-related ones) and for
courses in the area of African and
Afro-American studies (e.g., in com
parative and historical sociology, ur
banism and the study of sociocultural
change).
Regarding the matter of anthropol
ogy courses on Afro-American
societies and culture, no such courses
presently exist here — in spite of the
fact that "Afro-American anthropol
ogy" (encompassing the United States,
Latin America and the Caribbean) is a
rapidly growing field of inquiry.
Though government agencies and
corporations — the folks who supply a
good deal of money to certain sectors
of this university — presently tend to
be more interested in Latin America
and Asia, for reasons having to do with
economic and politico-military
strategy, many students would wel
come courses and expertise in Afro-
American anthropology.
Still no courses
In spite of the large number of
Afro-American students who elect to
major in, and/or take courses in, politi
cal science, there are still no courses
here on Afro-American involvement
in the political arena. And there is not
a single black political scientist here
with a faculty position — a fact which
hardly makes it easy for the Political
Science Department to attract and
maintain good, black graduate stu

dents.
At Stanford, a development has oc
cured that was not foreseen a decade
ago: the tremendous increase in the
number of black undergraduate pre
meds. There is obviously a need for
black faculty members to offer coun
seling and advice (third world stu
dents often find it hard to establish
personal ties with white professors)
and to serve as role models.
There are a helluva lot of blacks with
Fh.D.s in the biological sciences.
A final word: obviously, the needs
this column has discussed are neither
all inclusive nor solely peculiar to the
black community. In these areas,
chicanos and native Americans have
fared no better. In some cases, they
have even fared worse.
If there are those who feel that this
university has "paid its dues" to the
Stanford third world community,
there are others who know better.

When submitted to the Daily, the
titlefor my column of Jan. 13,1977 was
"Racism and affirmative action," not
"Affirmative action can't reduce ra
cism." I have never argued, verbally or
in print, that affirmative action prog
rams serve no function in the eradica
tion of racism. Only an imbecile would
make such an argument.
In the column, "Hearst, Money and
the Law" Daily, Dec. 9, my position
was similarly distorted. Toward the
end of my version of the article, I
wrote: "Nor is it that the poor are never
'equal before the law' — just that, in
capitalist society, 'justice* is, in the
final analysis, a commodity."
When the column was printed, the
word "never" had been changed to
"ever" and the words "just that" had
been omitted. This change had the ef
fect of reducing part of my analysis to
the level of the absurd.

On Nov. 18, 1968 — seven months
after Martin Luther King's assassina
tion and a little more than a year after
Stanford had begun to feel the pinch of
the nationwide "black studies move
ment," a rather important meeting of
the members of the Committee on the
Undergraduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies took place
here. Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs
presided over the meeting.
Together with student representa
tives, other faculty and staff members
present included Sanford Dornbusch,
Peter Duignan, G. Wesley Johnson,
Bruce Johnston, Martin Lowenkopf,
Patrick Manning and Hans Weiler. A
rare species now, black faculty at Stan
ford were all but nonexistent then.
Concerns
The minutes of that meeting indi
cate that a couple of matters were of
considerable concern to those in at
tendance: the need to increase black
faculty representation on campus and
the scarcity of courses related to as
pects of the "black experience." Here
are some passages from those minutes:
1 "The English Department has re
cently hired William Chace to teach
Afro-American literature (spring quar
ter), and is now looking for a specialist
in African literature."
2 "The Art Department is looking for
a faculty member interested in African
art."
3 "Professor Manning reported that
Professor Bertrand in the French De
partment has expressed an interest in
developing a course on French African
literature, if given time off from his
teaching duties to do so."
4 "Dr. Gibbs will send a memo to the
provost to ask him not to forget the
Sociology Department in the universi
ty's efforts to develop Afro-American
studies."
5 "It was also suggested that the
committee look into the possibility of
developing an introductory survey
course in Afro-American civilization
paralleling the African Civilizations
course. Presumably, such a course
would have been jointly taught by his
torians and anthropologists."
Need
An additional concern of the com
mittee was the need for someone, pref

erably an Afro-American, to teach
courses in the tremendously important
area of Afro-American politics.
It is interesting to note that, almost a
decade after the Nov. 18, 1968 meet
ing, there are still painfully obvious
deficiencies at this university in the
area of the recruitment of black faculty
and the development of black-related
courses. Moreover, the most glaring

deficiencies exist in precisely the areas
that were of such great concern a de
cade ago.
The English Department has never
hired anyone on a nontemporary basis
to teach African literature, though
there are a number of specialists in Af
rican literature around and courses in
this area are regularly offered at
numerous institutions that are not re
puted to be nearly as "hotshot" as
Stanford. In fact, many high schools
offer such courses.

hardly makes it easy for the Political
Science Department to attract and
maintain good, black graduate stu

dents.
At Stanford, a development has oc
cured that was not foreseen a decade
ago: the tremendous increase in the
number of black undergraduate pre
meds. There is obviously a need for
black faculty members to offer coun
seling and advice (third world stu
dents often find it hard to establish
personal ties with white professors)
and to serve as role models.
There are a helluva lot of blacks with
Fh.D.s in the biological sciences.
A final word: obviously, the needs
this column has discussed are neither
all inclusive nor solely peculiar to the
black community. In these areas,
chicanos and native Americans have
fared no better. In some cases, they
have even fared worse.
If there are those who feel that this
university has "paid its dues" to the
Stanford third world community,
there are others who know better.

When submitted to the Daily, the
titlefor my column of Jan. 13,1977 was
"Racism and affirmative action," not
"Affirmative action can't reduce ra
cism." I have never argued, verbally or
in print, that affirmative action prog
rams serve no function in the eradica
tion of racism. Only an imbecile would
make such an argument.
In the column, "Hearst, Money and
the Law" Daily, Dec. 9, my position
was similarly distorted. Toward the
end of my version of the article, I
wrote: "Nor is it that the poor are never
'equal before the law' — just that, in
capitalist society, 'justice* is, in the
final analysis, a commodity."
When the column was printed, the
word "never" had been changed to
"ever" and the words "just that" had
been omitted. This change had the ef
fect of reducing part of my analysis to
the level of the absurd.

On Nov. 18, 1968 — seven months
after Martin Luther King's assassina
tion and a little more than a year after
Stanford had begun to feel the pinch of
the nationwide "black studies move
ment," a rather important meeting of
the members of the Committee on the
Undergraduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies took place
here. Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs
presided over the meeting.
Together with student representa
tives, other faculty and staff members
present included Sanford Dornbusch,
Peter Duignan, G. Wesley Johnson,
Bruce Johnston, Martin Lowenkopf,
Patrick Manning and Hans Weiler. A
rare species now, black faculty at Stan
ford were all but nonexistent then.
Concerns
The minutes of that meeting indi
cate that a couple of matters were of
considerable concern to those in at
tendance: the need to increase black
faculty representation on campus and
the scarcity of courses related to as
pects of the "black experience." Here
are some passages from those minutes:
1 "The English Department has re
cently hired William Chace to teach
Afro-American literature (spring quar
ter), and is now looking for a specialist
in African literature."
2 "The Art Department is looking for
a faculty member interested in African
art."
3 "Professor Manning reported that
Professor Bertrand in the French De
partment has expressed an interest in
developing a course on French African
literature, if given time off from his
teaching duties to do so."
4 "Dr. Gibbs will send a memo to the
provost to ask him not to forget the
Sociology Department in the universi
ty's efforts to develop Afro-American
studies."
5 "It was also suggested that the
committee look into the possibility of
developing an introductory survey
course in Afro-American civilization
paralleling the African Civilizations
course. Presumably, such a course
would have been jointly taught by his
torians and anthropologists."
Need
An additional concern of the com
mittee was the need for someone, pref

erably an Afro-American, to teach
courses in the tremendously important
area of Afro-American politics.
It is interesting to note that, almost a
decade after the Nov. 18, 1968 meet
ing, there are still painfully obvious
deficiencies at this university in the
area of the recruitment of black faculty
and the development of black-related
courses. Moreover, the most glaring

deficiencies exist in precisely the areas
that were of such great concern a de
cade ago.
The English Department has never
hired anyone on a nontemporary basis
to teach African literature, though
there are a number of specialists in Af
rican literature around and courses in
this area are regularly offered at
numerous institutions that are not re
puted to be nearly as "hotshot" as
Stanford. In fact, many high schools
offer such courses.
With regard to the nontemporary fa
culty member in African art, appa
rently the Art Department is still look
ing .. .
By-product
Whatever the mystification, the fact
is that a by-product of Europe's expan
sion overseas has been the phenome
non of increasing numbers of non-
European peoples speaking European
languages. These non-Europeans—in
Asia, in Africa, in Latin America and
in the European and American met
ropoles — produce literature. To ig
nore the study of this literature in lan
guage classes (especially French,
Spanish and Portuguese) is to engage
not only in the business of building
language skills but also the business of
reproducing do facta racist ideology.
Encouragingly, the Spanish De
partment has offered a tenured posi

tion to a black woman who is in
terested in the literary expression of
various "underclasses" in the black
world. In certain other romance lan
guage departments, substantial de
ficiencies still exist. By the way, the
proposed course in French-African lit
erature never really got off the ground.
Persistent need
The Sociology Department has
managed, through the years, to obtain
black academics on various part-time
and short-term contracts. Nonetheless,
the need persists for black faculty (to
teach both traditional sociology
courses and black-related ones) and for
courses in the area of African and
Afro-American studies (e.g., in com
parative and historical sociology, ur
banism and the study of sociocultural
change).
Regarding the matter of anthropol
ogy courses on Afro-American
societies and culture, no such courses
presently exist here — in spite of the
fact that "Afro-American anthropol
ogy" (encompassing the United States,
Latin America and the Caribbean) is a
rapidly growing field of inquiry.
Though government agencies and
corporations — the folks who supply a
good deal of money to certain sectors
of this university — presently tend to
be more interested in Latin America
and Asia, for reasons having to do with
economic and politico-military
strategy, many students would wel
come courses and expertise in Afro-
American anthropology.
Still no courses
In spite of the large number of
Afro-American students who elect to
major in, and/or take courses in, politi
cal science, there are still no courses
here on Afro-American involvement
in the political arena. And there is not
a single black political scientist here
with a faculty position — a fact which
hardly makes it easy for the Political
Science Department to attract and
maintain good, black graduate stu

dents.
At Stanford, a development has oc

ford were all but nonexistent then.
Concerns
The minutes of that meeting indi
cate that a couple of matters were of
considerable concern to those in at
tendance: the need to increase black
faculty representation on campus and
the scarcity of courses related to as
pects of the "black experience." Here
are some passages from those minutes:
1 "The English Department has re
cently hired William Chace to teach
Afro-American literature (spring quar
ter), and is now looking for a specialist
in African literature."
2 "The Art Department is looking for
a faculty member interested in African
art."
3 "Professor Manning reported that
Professor Bertrand in the French De
partment has expressed an interest in
developing a course on French African
literature, if given time off from his
teaching duties to do so."
4 "Dr. Gibbs will send a memo to the
provost to ask him not to forget the
Sociology Department in the universi
ty's efforts to develop Afro-American
studies."
5 "It was also suggested that the
committee look into the possibility of
developing an introductory survey
course in Afro-American civilization
paralleling the African Civilizations
course. Presumably, such a course
would have been jointly taught by his
torians and anthropologists."
Need
An additional concern of the com
mittee was the need for someone, pref

erably an Afro-American, to teach
courses in the tremendously important
area of Afro-American politics.
It is interesting to note that, almost a
decade after the Nov. 18, 1968 meet
ing, there are still painfully obvious
deficiencies at this university in the
area of the recruitment of black faculty
and the development of black-related
courses. Moreover, the most glaring

deficiencies exist in precisely the areas
that were of such great concern a de
cade ago.
The English Department has never
hired anyone on a nontemporary basis
to teach African literature, though
there are a number of specialists in Af
rican literature around and courses in
this area are regularly offered at
numerous institutions that are not re
puted to be nearly as "hotshot" as
Stanford. In fact, many high schools
offer such courses.
With regard to the nontemporary fa
culty member in African art, appa
rently the Art Department is still look
ing .. .
By-product
Whatever the mystification, the fact
is that a by-product of Europe's expan
sion overseas has been the phenome
non of increasing numbers of non-
European peoples speaking European
languages. These non-Europeans—in
Asia, in Africa, in Latin America and
in the European and American met
ropoles — produce literature. To ig
nore the study of this literature in lan
guage classes (especially French,
Spanish and Portuguese) is to engage
not only in the business of building
language skills but also the business of
reproducing do facta racist ideology.
Encouragingly, the Spanish De
partment has offered a tenured posi

tion to a black woman who is in
terested in the literary expression of
various "underclasses" in the black
world. In certain other romance lan
guage departments, substantial de
ficiencies still exist. By the way, the
proposed course in French-African lit
erature never really got off the ground.
Persistent need
The Sociology Department has
managed, through the years, to obtain
black academics on various part-time
and short-term contracts. Nonetheless,
the need persists for black faculty (to
teach both traditional sociology
courses and black-related ones) and for
courses in the area of African and
Afro-American studies (e.g., in com
parative and historical sociology, ur
banism and the study of sociocultural
change).
Regarding the matter of anthropol
ogy courses on Afro-American
societies and culture, no such courses
presently exist here — in spite of the
fact that "Afro-American anthropol
ogy" (encompassing the United States,
Latin America and the Caribbean) is a
rapidly growing field of inquiry.
Though government agencies and
corporations — the folks who supply a
good deal of money to certain sectors
of this university — presently tend to
be more interested in Latin America
and Asia, for reasons having to do with
economic and politico-military
strategy, many students would wel
come courses and expertise in Afro-
American anthropology.
Still no courses
In spite of the large number of
Afro-American students who elect to
major in, and/or take courses in, politi
cal science, there are still no courses
here on Afro-American involvement
in the political arena. And there is not
a single black political scientist here
with a faculty position — a fact which
hardly makes it easy for the Political
Science Department to attract and
maintain good, black graduate stu

dents.
At Stanford, a development has oc
cured that was not foreseen a decade
ago: the tremendous increase in the
number of black undergraduate pre
meds. There is obviously a need for
black faculty members to offer coun
seling and advice (third world stu
dents often find it hard to establish
personal ties with white professors)
and to serve as role models.
There are a helluva lot of blacks with
Fh.D.s in the biological sciences.
A final word: obviously, the needs
this column has discussed are neither
all inclusive nor solely peculiar to the
black community. In these areas,
chicanos and native Americans have
fared no better. In some cases, they
have even fared worse.
If there are those who feel that this
university has "paid its dues" to the
Stanford third world community,
there are others who know better.

When submitted to the Daily, the
titlefor my column of Jan. 13,1977 was
"Racism and affirmative action," not
"Affirmative action can't reduce ra
cism." I have never argued, verbally or
in print, that affirmative action prog
rams serve no function in the eradica
tion of racism. Only an imbecile would
make such an argument.
In the column, "Hearst, Money and
the Law" Daily, Dec. 9, my position
was similarly distorted. Toward the
end of my version of the article, I
wrote: "Nor is it that the poor are never
'equal before the law' — just that, in
capitalist society, 'justice* is, in the
final analysis, a commodity."
When the column was printed, the
word "never" had been changed to
"ever" and the words "just that" had
been omitted. This change had the ef
fect of reducing part of my analysis to
the level of the absurd.
