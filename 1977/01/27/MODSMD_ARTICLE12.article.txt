Students should have the opportun
ity to decide whether elected ASSU
officials are paid and to get their share
of the payments back if they strenu
ously object to such salaries.
Those are the principles behind a
measure 1 will bring before the ASSU
Senate By-Laws Committee this week,
and hopefully before the full senate at
its next meeting. The move already has
been approved by the Senate Finance
Committee.
My proposed addition to the ASStI
By-Laws would read, "The Financial
Manager may not include in the
budget money for salaries or tuition
grants to popularly elected officers of
the ASSU or officers of the Senate.
Such funds must be raised through a
fee assessment."
Currently, some $10,070 in salaries
and tuition grants is paid annually
from the ASSU budget to members of
the Council of Presidents (COP) and
the Senate chairperson and parliamen
tarian. Students are given no direct
voice over these funds; they are merely
skimmed off the top of ASSU opera
tions.
1 believe- that refundable fee assess
ments are the least noxious way to
fund potentially controversial ASSU

expenditures. First, they are subject to
scrutiny and rejection by the voters,
and second, they may be reclaimed
even if approved.
Certainly payments to ASSU
politicos must be classified as a con
troversial expenditure. Recent elec
tions have demonstrated a low esteem
in which ASSU government is held by
the students.
Outside of electing joke and protest
candidates, however, students have no
present means for expressing their
outrage at the conduct of ASSI) gov
ernment. My "Power of the Pursestr
ings" amendment will give them that
leverage, if they choose to use it.
One can anticipate, of course, the
wailing with which the ASSU
bureaucracy is likely to greet this
proposal. "The end of student gov
ernment," some may call it. It is not.
First, the outcome of a fee assess
ment on salaries is not at all clear. A
look at the votes on assessments over
the past three years shows that stu
dents generally have been most will
ing to approve even those projects
from which they don't receive im
mediate benefit.
Indeed, it is only those assessments
which have been widely pictured as

ill-conceived ventures (the record
co-op) or designed to benefit a few at
the expense of the many (Nor Cal
PIRG) that have been defeated.
If salaries for elected officials cannot
pass muster before such a tame electo
rate, who would be so arrogant as to
insist that they should be paid?
Second, even if the fee assessment
were defeated, the damage to ASSU
government would be not at all clear.
Students currently serve on the senate,
on a number of university committees,
and a number of student organizations
without pay. They do so for the status,
experience and satisfaction that such
service gives them.
There is no reason that such motiva
tion would not apply just as well, if not
better, to the COP and the offices of the
senate.
In short, the "Power of the Purse
strings" amendment would give the
students a handle over funds that are
currently taken from them to pay for
something they may not want.
If this change seems desirable to
you, please contact an ASSI 'senator in
the coming week and express your
opinion.
