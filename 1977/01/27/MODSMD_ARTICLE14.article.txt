# Political prisoners find a friend
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Some 10,000 persons are free today be
cause of Amnesty International, according
to Wendy Turnbull, media director of the
organization's western division.
She made her remarks yesterday at noon
to an audience of about 60 at Bolivar House.
Turnbull quoted Soviet dissident Andrei
Amalrik, who recently visited here on the
effect of Amnesty International (AI) on rep
ressive governments that seek to quash dis
sent: "you may not get the man you're work
ing for released, but you may prevent the
next one from being arrested."
Turnbull named Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Uruguay as the Latin American coun
tries which are presently the worst as far as
human rights violation are concerned.
Wrong thinking
"In Uruguay," she said, "you can get ar
rested if you even think about saying some
thing against the government."
Turnbull cited a number of developments
as hopeful signs on the human rights front
in Latin America, including:
—President Carter's "mentioning human
rights by name twice in his inaugural ad
dress" and his statement in that speech that
"covert actions" would be used on a more
limited basis than previously;
—passage by Congress of legislation
which provides for the termination of U.S.
military aid to governments violating
human rights;
—passage by Congress of "the first Harkin
amendment," which provides for the ter
mination of U.S. economic aid in such
cases;
—a Congressional mandate that the U.S.
governor on the board of the Inter-American
Development bank vote against multilateral
loans to countries that are "gross violators
of human rights;"
—recently made recommendations con
tained in the Linowitz Report, prepared
under Sol Linowitz, chairman of the board
of Xerox, which called for opening Ameri
can borders to political refugees and open
ing local American embassies for political
asylum. Turnbull cited this as evidence that
even "multinational chairmen of the board"
are "feeling very sensitive to these issues."
In addition to these measures, Turnbull

also mentioned an ongoing investigation by
Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wisc.) into the ques
tion of whether private banks, which oper
ate under charters granted by the federal
government, ought to be restricted in their
right to make loans to repressive govern
ments to make up for the capital these gov
ernments are being prevented from receiv
ing under bilateral or multilateral govern
ment aid programs.
She said that in the case of countries such
as Haiti, where human rights are often viol
ated but where, because of their low level of
economic development, cutting off trade
would adversely affect the general popula
tion, AI is "not asking for a cutoff of trade
but to use trade for leverage."
While she reported no success in this re
gard till now, she said approaches had been
made to various banks and businesses to
"make human, as well as economic" con
siderations conditions for the granting of
loans to less-developed countries.
Turnbull said that Argentina is scheduled
to become the next special target of Al's
efforts to protect human rights and secure
the release of political prisoners.
She showed the audience a copy of a list
she recently received from Al's main office
in London listing examples of "scientific
and cultural repression" in Argentina since
the military coup there last Mar. 24. The list,
she said, included "5000 disappearances"
of journalists, psychologists and others, and
examples of numerous dismissals from uni
versities and other educational institutions.
AI methodology
The organization's methods, said
Turnbull, include sending missions to the
country involved, holding hearings within
the United States and "massive letter writ
ing campaigns" directed towards officials
in the offending country. She also said that
AI encouraged people to communicate their
concern to their elected representatives in
Washington.
Asked about the construction of nuclear
power generating plants in Brazil, Turnbull
admitted that she was "a one-issue candi
date" and could not say whether construc
tion of such facilities would be good, bad or
indifferent for Brazil.

She said the organization's annual budget
was around $475,000. She said that as a
matter of policy, "no government funds"
are accepted.
She said that the European leadership of
AI, whose central office is in London, is
somewhat suspicious of the American
branch, worrying that its members may be
"capitalist, imperialists pigs," who are tak
ing "laundered money." For this reason,
Turnbull said, all donations larger than five
per cent of the annual budget must be ap
proved by the international office.
"They don't like Ford and Rockefeller
(Foundation) money. We do," she said.
Turnbull said that AI chapters never work
for prisoners in their own country. She said
that there were some members of a German
chapter of AI currently in the United States
looking into the situation of native Ameri
cans.
She said that the group is "very careful
not to make things more dangerous" for its
members in countries known for their
human rights violations. Nevertheless, she
admitted, two people from Al's Moscow of
fice have been sent to Siberia because of
their work on behalf of human rights.
Turnbull said that AI had grown over the
last two years from 2500 members to 55,000
divided into 87 groups around the country,
each of which pays $450 annually to sup
port the work of the organization's central
secretariat, which prepares and distributes
information about political prisoners.

last two years from 2500 members to 55,000
divided into 87 groups around the country,
each of which pays $450 annually to sup
port the work of the organization's central
secretariat, which prepares and distributes
information about political prisoners.
Some 10,000 persons are free today be
cause of Amnesty International, according
to Wendy Turnbull, media director of the
organization's western division.
She made her remarks yesterday at noon
to an audience of about 60 at Bolivar House.
Turnbull quoted Soviet dissident Andrei
Amalrik, who recently visited here on the
effect of Amnesty International (AI) on rep
ressive governments that seek to quash dis
sent: "you may not get the man you're work
ing for released, but you may prevent the
next one from being arrested."
Turnbull named Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Uruguay as the Latin American coun
tries which are presently the worst as far as
human rights violation are concerned.
Wrong thinking
"In Uruguay," she said, "you can get ar
rested if you even think about saying some
thing against the government."
Turnbull cited a number of developments
as hopeful signs on the human rights front
in Latin America, including:
—President Carter's "mentioning human
rights by name twice in his inaugural ad
dress" and his statement in that speech that
"covert actions" would be used on a more
limited basis than previously;
—passage by Congress of legislation
which provides for the termination of U.S.
military aid to governments violating
human rights;
—passage by Congress of "the first Harkin
amendment," which provides for the ter
mination of U.S. economic aid in such
cases;
—a Congressional mandate that the U.S.
governor on the board of the Inter-American
Development bank vote against multilateral
loans to countries that are "gross violators
of human rights;"
—recently made recommendations con
tained in the Linowitz Report, prepared
under Sol Linowitz, chairman of the board
of Xerox, which called for opening Ameri
can borders to political refugees and open
ing local American embassies for political
asylum. Turnbull cited this as evidence that
even "multinational chairmen of the board"
are "feeling very sensitive to these issues."
In addition to these measures, Turnbull

also mentioned an ongoing investigation by
Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wisc.) into the ques
tion of whether private banks, which oper
ate under charters granted by the federal
government, ought to be restricted in their
right to make loans to repressive govern
ments to make up for the capital these gov
ernments are being prevented from receiv
ing under bilateral or multilateral govern
ment aid programs.
She said that in the case of countries such
as Haiti, where human rights are often viol
ated but where, because of their low level of
economic development, cutting off trade
would adversely affect the general popula
tion, AI is "not asking for a cutoff of trade
but to use trade for leverage."
While she reported no success in this re
gard till now, she said approaches had been
made to various banks and businesses to
"make human, as well as economic" con
siderations conditions for the granting of
loans to less-developed countries.
Turnbull said that Argentina is scheduled
to become the next special target of Al's
efforts to protect human rights and secure
the release of political prisoners.
She showed the audience a copy of a list
she recently received from Al's main office
in London listing examples of "scientific
and cultural repression" in Argentina since
the military coup there last Mar. 24. The list,
she said, included "5000 disappearances"
of journalists, psychologists and others, and
examples of numerous dismissals from uni
versities and other educational institutions.
AI methodology
The organization's methods, said
Turnbull, include sending missions to the
country involved, holding hearings within
the United States and "massive letter writ
ing campaigns" directed towards officials
in the offending country. She also said that
AI encouraged people to communicate their
concern to their elected representatives in
Washington.
Asked about the construction of nuclear
power generating plants in Brazil, Turnbull
admitted that she was "a one-issue candi
date" and could not say whether construc
tion of such facilities would be good, bad or
indifferent for Brazil.

She said the organization's annual budget
was around $475,000. She said that as a
matter of policy, "no government funds"
are accepted.
She said that the European leadership of
AI, whose central office is in London, is
somewhat suspicious of the American
branch, worrying that its members may be
"capitalist, imperialists pigs," who are tak
ing "laundered money." For this reason,
Turnbull said, all donations larger than five
per cent of the annual budget must be ap
proved by the international office.
"They don't like Ford and Rockefeller
(Foundation) money. We do," she said.
Turnbull said that AI chapters never work
for prisoners in their own country. She said
that there were some members of a German
chapter of AI currently in the United States
looking into the situation of native Ameri
cans.
She said that the group is "very careful
not to make things more dangerous" for its
members in countries known for their
human rights violations. Nevertheless, she
admitted, two people from Al's Moscow of
fice have been sent to Siberia because of
their work on behalf of human rights.

not to make things more dangerous" for its
members in countries known for their
human rights violations. Nevertheless, she
admitted, two people from Al's Moscow of
fice have been sent to Siberia because of
their work on behalf of human rights.
Turnbull said that AI had grown over the
last two years from 2500 members to 55,000
divided into 87 groups around the country,
each of which pays $450 annually to sup
port the work of the organization's central
secretariat, which prepares and distributes
information about political prisoners.
Some 10,000 persons are free today be
cause of Amnesty International, according
to Wendy Turnbull, media director of the
organization's western division.
She made her remarks yesterday at noon
to an audience of about 60 at Bolivar House.
Turnbull quoted Soviet dissident Andrei
Amalrik, who recently visited here on the
effect of Amnesty International (AI) on rep
ressive governments that seek to quash dis
sent: "you may not get the man you're work
ing for released, but you may prevent the
next one from being arrested."
Turnbull named Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Uruguay as the Latin American coun
tries which are presently the worst as far as
human rights violation are concerned.
Wrong thinking
"In Uruguay," she said, "you can get ar
rested if you even think about saying some
thing against the government."
Turnbull cited a number of developments
as hopeful signs on the human rights front
in Latin America, including:
—President Carter's "mentioning human
rights by name twice in his inaugural ad
dress" and his statement in that speech that
"covert actions" would be used on a more
limited basis than previously;
—passage by Congress of legislation
which provides for the termination of U.S.
military aid to governments violating
human rights;
—passage by Congress of "the first Harkin
amendment," which provides for the ter
mination of U.S. economic aid in such
cases;
—a Congressional mandate that the U.S.
governor on the board of the Inter-American
Development bank vote against multilateral
loans to countries that are "gross violators
of human rights;"
—recently made recommendations con
tained in the Linowitz Report, prepared
under Sol Linowitz, chairman of the board
of Xerox, which called for opening Ameri
can borders to political refugees and open
ing local American embassies for political
asylum. Turnbull cited this as evidence that
even "multinational chairmen of the board"
are "feeling very sensitive to these issues."
In addition to these measures, Turnbull

also mentioned an ongoing investigation by
Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wisc.) into the ques
tion of whether private banks, which oper
ate under charters granted by the federal
government, ought to be restricted in their
right to make loans to repressive govern
ments to make up for the capital these gov
ernments are being prevented from receiv
ing under bilateral or multilateral govern
ment aid programs.
She said that in the case of countries such
as Haiti, where human rights are often viol
ated but where, because of their low level of
economic development, cutting off trade
would adversely affect the general popula
tion, AI is "not asking for a cutoff of trade
but to use trade for leverage."
While she reported no success in this re
gard till now, she said approaches had been
made to various banks and businesses to
"make human, as well as economic" con
siderations conditions for the granting of
loans to less-developed countries.
Turnbull said that Argentina is scheduled
to become the next special target of Al's
efforts to protect human rights and secure
the release of political prisoners.
She showed the audience a copy of a list
she recently received from Al's main office
in London listing examples of "scientific
and cultural repression" in Argentina since
the military coup there last Mar. 24. The list,
she said, included "5000 disappearances"
of journalists, psychologists and others, and
examples of numerous dismissals from uni
versities and other educational institutions.
AI methodology
The organization's methods, said
Turnbull, include sending missions to the
country involved, holding hearings within
the United States and "massive letter writ
ing campaigns" directed towards officials
in the offending country. She also said that
AI encouraged people to communicate their
concern to their elected representatives in
Washington.
Asked about the construction of nuclear
power generating plants in Brazil, Turnbull
admitted that she was "a one-issue candi
date" and could not say whether construc
tion of such facilities would be good, bad or
indifferent for Brazil.

She said the organization's annual budget
was around $475,000. She said that as a
matter of policy, "no government funds"
are accepted.
She said that the European leadership of
AI, whose central office is in London, is
somewhat suspicious of the American
branch, worrying that its members may be
"capitalist, imperialists pigs," who are tak
ing "laundered money." For this reason,
Turnbull said, all donations larger than five
per cent of the annual budget must be ap
proved by the international office.
"They don't like Ford and Rockefeller
(Foundation) money. We do," she said.
Turnbull said that AI chapters never work
for prisoners in their own country. She said
that there were some members of a German
chapter of AI currently in the United States
looking into the situation of native Ameri
cans.
