# Too much violence on TV; NBC planning action
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” There is too
much violence on television,
says the president of the NBC
television network, and he's
doing something about it.
"We're saying, 'Enough of
that,' " Robert Howard said in an
interview with the Associated
Press.
He commented in the face of
mounting attacks on television
violence from such quarters as
the Parent-Teachers Associa
tion, the American Medical As
sociation, the National Citizens

Committee for Broadcasting and
the advertising industry.
The network chief said NBC
would de-emphasize violence in
the season that begins next fall,
although it would retain shows
like Police Story, and Colombo.
He added that the network
began planning for the change
last fall in the belief that a desire
for gratuitous violence has "run
the course." And he said NBC's
affiliates have been pressing for
less of it.
He said NBC had all but com

pleted its selections, to be an
nounced in mid-April, of 50
pilot programs for the coming
season. Twenty-one are com
edies and most of the rest are var
iety shows, family programs and
dramas that shun violence, he
said.
Despite NBC's Jan. 5
documentary on Violence in
America, on why people enjoy
violence, which made the oppo
site claim, Howard denied that
violence was the route to high
ratings.
