# Hunger activities planned

### Claire Oshetsky 
The members of the Stanford
Committee on Hunger are cur
rently working on several pro
jects to follow up last quarter's
successful Day of Fasting. On
Feb. 23, a peninsula-wide Miles
for Meals Walkathon will be
held in San Francisco. The Stan
ford Committee on Hunger will
publicize the event on campus
and work for the support of the
students.
The committee has planned a
SWOPSI course for the spring
quarter which will deal with
local, national and world food
problems. Guest faculty mem
bers from the Food Research In
stitute, Political Science De
partment, Economics Depart
ment and Medical School will
lecture. Several films are plan
ned for the spring quarter, deal
ing with both nutrition and
hunger relief.
The committee says it does not
plan another Day of Fasting this
year. Maxine Anderson, man
ager of the Food Service,
explained.
"The Stanford Committee on
Hunger cooperated beautifully
with us, but the Day of Fasting
takes money out of our budget
which we have counted on," she
said.
The last Day of Fasting raised
nearly $4000, most of which went
to UNICEF. The number of stu
dents who participated in the
project grew substantially from
the year before, according to
Curtis Whitman, an active
member of the committee.
"People's awareness is what
counts, and we reached a sub
stantial number of people. Hope
fully, next year's Day of Fasting
will be even more of a success,"

he said.
The Stanford Committee on
Hunger consists of 10 active
members and about 25 less ac
tive members, according to Dan
Caldwell, a member of the com
mittee.

"The amount of work we do is
limited by the number of people
interested. If people can only do
a little, we still have projects for
them," he said. The committee
meets weekly in the Round
Room of Memorial Church.
