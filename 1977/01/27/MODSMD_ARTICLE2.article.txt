# County transit system to undergo expansion
## 
### Randy Block 
The Santa Clara County transit sys
tem is being enlarged, and studies for
alternative modes of transit are being
made with revenues from the x /i per
cent transit tax approved in an initia
tive in March last year.
The expected revenue of $89.2 mill
ion over the next five years will be
used to expand the county's bus fleet
from 236 to 516, and replace 78 de
teriorated buses, according to County
Supervisor Geraldine Steinberg.
In addition, she said, frequency of
service will be doubled on existing
routes and new routes will be added
with the eventual goal of serving 98
per cent of the county's population
with bus routes within V* mile of their
homes.
Serving business areas
An express bus now operates bet
ween Saratoga and the California Av
enue Southern Pacific depot. The bus
serves many important employment
locations, including Stanford Indust
rial Park. A new vehicle repair facility
will be built in the county within the
next five years.
Studies of light-rail transit, similar
to San Francisco's streetcars, have
been made here by the consulting firm
of DeLeuw, Cather and Company.
In addition, the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG) and the
Metropolitan Transportation Commis
sion (MTC) is now studying possible
light-rail routes throughout the
county.
Municipal governments have been
requested to express an opinion on the
study, which has already recom
mended one route. Many city govern
ments have delayed their responses
until the ABAG-MTC study can be
completed.
Palo Alto City Council has taken no
stand, but recommended at its Jan. 4
meeting that the preferred corridor be
preserved for future options, and that
the county transit board make no deci
sions regarding light-rail until the
ABAG-MTC study is completed.
Palo Alto prefers buses
None of the five routes examined by
the DeLeuw and Cather study would
serve Palo Alto. A Palo Alto municipal
staff report issued last month, stated.
"Buses have been in the past and will

continue to be Palo Alto's preferred
transit alternative."
The report continued. "Light-rail is
generally a poor choice for Santa Clara
County, because the high capital re
quirements work against providing an
adequate level of transit service now
and in the near future."
Until 1972 a county-wide transit
system was nonexistent here, accord
ing to Steinberg. In that year, the Santa
Clara County Transit District (SCCTD)
was formed, supplanting several
municipal systems. State aid money
was made available by an Act of the
California Assembly that year.
However, after five years a transit
district is required to match the state
funds one to one. Thus, according to
Steinberg, had the tax not been ap
proved, the SC(7TD would have had to
close in 1977 because of removal of
State support, as well as Federal
matching funds.
The first buses should be in use this
summer. The system will not be able to
handle all its potential customers,
however, she said.
"We want to capture 30 per cent of
all trips in Santa Clara County," Stein
berg explained. "We don't have the
system to attract them now."
Light-rail a possibility
Steinberg said she believes that in
creasing transportation pressures will
soon justify light-rail here. "We are
sure that we will need some kind of rail
transit by 1990."
If there is no increase in public
transportation use, she said, 50 per
cent increase in traffic on roads in the
county can be expected.
Asked to compare bus and light-rail,
Steinberg explained that to riders the
only significant difference is that
light-rail, running on its own right
of-way and not on streets, does not
have to compete with auto traffic as
much as a bus.
The light-rail vehicle costs $750,000
as against $75,000 for a bus, according
to Prof. Vincent Roggeveen, of the
Civil Engineering Department.
In addition, the right-of-way must be
acquired, and the track built. The rail
vehicle itself does not emit exhaust,
however the electric power operation
may produce pollution.
