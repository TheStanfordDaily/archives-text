# Thai professor predicts civil war in homeland

Civil war is likely in Thailand
in the near future, according to
Puey Ungpakorn, former dean of
economics at a Bangkok univer
sity who was exiled after Oc
tober's military coup there.
Many Thais "have come to the
conclusion that armed struggle
is the only alternative," Puey
told an audience at the Law
School Tuesday night. He
criticized the recently installed
"fascist military regime."
Puey, a prominent intellectual
in Thailand before the coup and
an active participant in the mod
erate democratic government
which governed that country be
tween 1973 and last October, has
been touring the United States
for the past four weeks in an ef
fort to inform the American
people about the situation in
Thailand and raise support for
reform.
Puey termed the government
of Tanin Krainixien, present
prime minister of Thailand,
"civilian government under
military rule," adding that the
military leaders who staged the
coup still run the country.
He described the tight press
censorship and lack of civil
rights under the new govern
ment and estimated that some

5000 political arrests had taken
place since October.
Thailand, said Puey, though
"one of the best among develop
ing countries" with steady
economic growth, posseses an
impoverished countryside be
cause the benefits of growth and
progress are concentrated
among the rich and around the
urban centers, Bangkok in par
ticular. The situation can only be
improved through basic social
reforms, he said.
The communist insurgents,
who have plagued Thailand for
decades, thrive in the im
poverished rural areas and are
active, Puey estimated, in 35 of
Thailand's 73 provinces. " n
Since the coup "intellectuals
feel they must chose either dic
tatorship of the right or of the
left," which will help speed a
civil war, he said.
Puey, himself, said he sides
with neither the communists nor
the present government, since a
victory by either group would
not bring freedom to Thailand.
He advocated instead a moderate
democratic government which
would let Thailand "live in an
atmosphere of freedom." How
ever, he said, he has little hope
that this will happen.
