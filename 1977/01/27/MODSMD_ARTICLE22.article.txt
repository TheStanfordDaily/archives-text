# Grand jury recommended
## Test results withheld from FDA 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Food and Drug
Administration is recommending a federal
grand jury investigation into allegations
that a major drug company withheld
selected test results to win approval for two
drugs and a food additive.
FDA officials said a letter sent to the Jus
tice Department alleged that G.D. Searle &
Co. of Skokie, 111., decided which tests it
wanted the FDA to see. The agency recom
mended the grand jury investigate whether
the company or its officers committed any
criminal offense, the officials said.
FDA sources said the allegations in
volved data submitted by Searle in asking
agency approval to market at least three
substances: aspartame, an artificial
sweetener for foods; aldactone, a diuretic;
and flagyl, a treatment for vaginitis.
The FDA approved aspartame but with

drew approval after it began suspecting the
test data. No aspartame has gone on the
market. Aldactone and flagyl are still in use
but are labelled with safety warnings.
Justice Department spokesman Mark
Sheehan confirmed receipt of the letter but
said ..o decision has been made whether to
convene a grand jury.
Both the FDA and the Justice Department
declined to release the Jan. 10 letterbut FDA
sources said the allegations made in the
document were similar to those made by an
FDA task force last year.
That earlier report concluded "Searle has
not submitted all the facts of experiments to
FDA, retaining unto itself the unpermitted
option of filtering, interpreting and not
submitting information which we would
consider material to the safety evaluation of
the product.

"At the heart of FDA's regulatory process
is its ability to rely upon the integrity of the
basic safety data submitted by sponsors of
regulated products. Our investigation
clearly demonstrates that, in theG.D. Searle
Co., we have no basis for such reliance
now," the report said.
The task force also had recommended
federal prosecutors call a grand jury inves
tigation.
A spokesman for the company said it
could not comment on the specific allega
tions in the FDA letter "because we don't
know what they are. We have maintained
from the beginning that if this does go to a
grand jury we will vigorously defend our
position and we feel we can do so."
Searle has strongly disputed the conclu
sions of the earlier task force report, calling
it "incomplete, biased and distorted."
