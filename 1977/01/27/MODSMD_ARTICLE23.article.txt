# Raw egg-eating record cracked
## 
### 
Clovis (AP) — Construction worker How
ard Newell elected to pass his usual break
fast of eggs and bacon Wednesday morning
after claiming a new record for raw egg
swallowing the night before — 63 within 15
minutes.
Newell's achievement was dimmed only
slightly by a quick trip to the men's room
after his feat earned him the plaudits of a
crowd of about 200 at the Cowtown USA
saloon.
"1 talked to my doctor and he said I'd
better get rid of these eggs right away," the
168-pound Newell said shortly before
throwing up.
Newell, 27, broke an unofficial record set
earlier this month by Art Railow, of Bur
roak, lowa, who ate 50 raw egges in 42 mi
nutes. Railow has vowed another assault on
the record on Feb. 27.

Newell gulped 50 eggs — six at a time in a
wineglass — in the first three minutes.
An effort to crack the reported world
record of 13 eggs in 3.8 seconds failed. Newell
started his assault with a tall glass of 14 eggs
but took 4.3 seconds to get it down. He
apologized afterward.
"I feel like a turkey with egg on my face,"
Newell said. "I ate a lot more in a lot less
time before, but everybody just freaked me
out. I never did it before with a lot of people
around."
Consumption of the 63 eggs took an
elapsed time of 14 minutes, 25 seconds, in
cluding the 10-minute break.
According to theGuinness Book of World
Records, the record for consumption of
soft-boiled eggs was set by Douglas L.
Burch, who ate 32 in 130 seconds in 1975.
There is no entry for raw egg-eating.
