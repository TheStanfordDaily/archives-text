## A
						piece of crap' 'Nickelodeon' sinks 
### Howard Baldwin 
Dearly Beloved, we are
gathered here today to mourn
the passing of a highly-esteemed
career, one that could have
skyrocketed off to previously
unexplored heights, unfettered
by sadness and defeat. I speak, of
course, of the career of the man
who has brought countless
laughter to millions and who has
enriched the lives and bank ac
counts of hundreds of others,
Peter Bogdanovich.
It was Peter who vividly ex
posed the underpinnings of both
a small Texas town and Cybill
Shepherd in The Last Picture
Show. It was Peter who deli
vered to Barbra Streisand and
Kyan O'Neal their best roles to
date (and possibly their best
ever, at the rate they're going) in
Whnt's Up, Doc? It was Peter
who presented America with its
littlest sweetheart, Tatum
O'Neal, who blasphemed her
way into the hearts of Americans
in Paper Moon.
Sadly though, all that has pas
sed now. Peter's career took sick
with Daisy Miller, who also took
sick. Daisy died, and so did the
film. Whatever they succumbed
to was contagious, and his
career was infected.
Intensive care
It entered intensive care after
At Long Last Love, a silly
travesty that took the whole cast
down along with it — Burt
Reynolds, Madeline kahn, John
Hillerman, Eileen Brennan and
Cybill (again?).
Worried, Peter called in the
best specialists he could find.
They told him to return to basics,
to return to what which he knew
best, to do a film that only he
could rightly bring to the screen
in all its splendor and glory!
The pioneer days of movies!
Nickelodeons! D.W. Griffith!
Who better than a former film
buff to document those carefree
frenetic times? It was to be Pe
ter's comeback, his career's re
covery, the triumphant return of
the prodigal son to his rightful
place among the brilliant young
directors of Hollvwood. And

they called it. .. Nickelodeon.
It's a piece of crap.
Idiocy
I've never said that about any
movie before, though I've often
had the urge, but never before
has a movie aspired so high and
sunk so low to produce a discor
dant, discouraging, ragged, un
satisfying two hours of idiocy.
Gathering up all his sure-fire
elements, Bogdanovich took
both O'Neals, Burt Reynolds,
nostalgia, and wrapped them up
into the sloppiest, most unorigi
nal piece of mishmosh possible.
Nickelodeon has that abused
look of films that have had two
directors. Like The Man Who
Fell To Earth, it looks like two
films with the same cast that
were spliced together midway
and released as supposedly mak
ing sense.
Leo Harrigan (O'Neal) is a car
bon copy of the solid old idiot
Howard Bannister in Whnt's Up,
Doc? Tatum exudes none of the
charm for which she is famed.
She acts like she's doing the
movie under penalty of torture.
Reynolds once again shows his
penchant for comedy, once
again in a movie that does not tax
his talents in the least.
Pure Bogdanovich
The first half of Nickelodeon is
pure Bogdanovich, a wild,
happy picture of accidental
careers that sprouted in the si
lent era, a madcap stream of
people being in the right place at
the right time for love, for suc
cess, for happiness. And then it
all falls apart.
Imitating the fast-paced, witty
dialogue of Paper Moon, the
characters banter back and forth
while the audience waits for a
non-existent punch line. The
pace is fast, but the wit is left
behind. The dramatic path of the
story is nonexistent. Caps in
time and sense make the produc
tion look like Swiss cheese.
What little fun that shines
through is completely engulfed
by the devilry of the monopolis
tic Patents Company, which
tormented and sabotaged inde
pendent filmmakers in the silent

era. Its destructive rampage
bulldozes undaunted.
Incoherent garbage
Not only is the Patents Com
pany strangling them, but their
own employer. A.). Cobb (Brian
Keith) has been tampering with
their product, making it into in
coherent garbage (a lot like Nic
kelodeon). Yet at the end of the
film, a cinematic garbage pail in
itself, Cobb spouts the
philosophy of film as told to
Bogdanovich by Jimmy Stewart.
The heartwarming touch is so to
tally out of place for the villain
ous bastard that its inclusion is
ridiculous.
Another unnecessary tribute
is the overlong excerpt of D.W.
Griffith's Birth Of A Nation at
the end. Bogdanovich's idoliza
tions of the silent film particip
ants don't even halfway make up
for the shoddy way he's treated
them for the entire movie. The
tribute is out of place, out of line,
and Peter is out of luck.
Bogdanovich deserves to end
up like Harrigan and his gang,
washed up and rinsed out, if all
he can turn out are schizoid
pieces of schlock unsure of
whether to be tributes or razzber
ries, comedies or tragedies.


A nasty serve

feud with the Baron in Herbert Ross' The Seven Percent Solu
