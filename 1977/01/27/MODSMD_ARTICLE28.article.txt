# Danica gives excellent concert
## 
### Nan Thompson 
It would be hard to say who
enjoyed themselves more at
Danica's performance last
Saturday evening, the audience
or Danica. The musical excel
lence of the concert was rivalled
only by the enthusiasm the voc
alists demonstrated for the East
European folksongs which they
sang.
Danica is a group of 35 singers
and musicians from all over the
Hay area who have discovered
the beauty of this ethnic music
and hope to share it with others.
The blend of their voices was
evidence of the fact that some
members of the group have been
singing together for six years.
Danica had the rare talent of
evoking the audience's emotions
while singing in languages few
of the listerners could under
stand. The vocal tones they pro
duced were amazingly rich and
full.
The choral skills these songs
from the Balkan region de
manded would challenge any

singer. The performance was
almost entirely a capella. The
melodies contained both soft,
chanted harmonies and high
yodel-like inflections.
Their performance was au
gmented by musicians playing
authentic regional instruments.
Stewart Mennin skillfully
played a Bulgarian tune on the
gajda, an instrument which re
sembles the Scottish bagpipe.
Later, Mennin executed a
clarinet solo in the Albanian
style which sounded like jazz.
The songs Danica sings are all
authentic East European
melodies. Some have been col
lected during travels, others
have been purchased from
Yugoslavian sources or learned
from recent immigrants.
The directors of the group,
Susan Mintz and Frank
Dubinskas are hoping that
Danica will be able to make an
album soon. Their talent is cer
tainly worthy of recording. Any
music lover should be sorry to
have missed it.
