# Seven Percent: a 'tight, efficient thriller'
## 
### 
By Howard Baldwin
For those of you who have
grown old wondering why
Melanie Griffith tried to seduce
Paul Newman in The Drowning
Pool; why Dustin Hoffman and
Marthe Keller were mugged in
Marathon Man; and why Night
Moves ended in such carnage, at
last someone has made a film
tied up neatly like a Christmas
package. Herbert Ross' (The
Sunshine Boys, Play It Again,
Sam) The Seven Percent Solu
tion, thanks to Nicholas Meyer's
superbly constructed screen
play from his novel, is a tight,
efficient thriller without loose

ends to detract from its effect.
From the beginning credits
(when we learn that this is the
story of a three-year disappear
ance of the master detective
Sherlock Holmes) to the final
curtain, each clue is dangled,
tracked and explained in the
same logical and deductive
order that the protagonists
Holmes and Sigmund Freud
would have employed.
Never is the audience left to
ponder the improbability or im
plausibility of a turn of events, a
welcome respite from the dark
and murky mystery plots that
have all the logical progression

of a novel with intermittent
pages torn out.
The Seven Percent Solution is
nothing of the sort. It leaps
athletically along, barely stop
ping to rest and never getting
winded. It answers everything
you want to know about Sher
lock Holmes but were afraid to
ask. tying up his phobias and
anxieties in neat little boxes
borne of hypnosis and
psychoanalysis.
Dr. Watson (Robert Duval 1)
leads Holmes (Nicol William
son) to Vienna by devising a
false trail of Moriarty (Laurence

Olivier), Holmes' arch nemesis.
There he places Holmes in the
care of none other than Sigmund
Freud (Alan Arkin), who cures
him of his addiction to cocaine
and then enlists his help in the
case of a kidnapped actress
(Vanessa Redgrave).
The all-star cast also includes
Joel Grey, Jeremy Kemp and
Samantha Eggar. Its acting is un
iformly perfect. With each role
Robert Duval 1 confirms his ta
lent as a character actdr. He will
be dealt a severe injustice if he is
not nominated for the Academy
Award for either this or his role
in Network.
As for Nicol Williamson,
watching him first employ and

then explain Holmes' deductive
powers when he first meets
Freud boggles the senses. His
energetic performance infuses
the production with a vitality
that in turn is transferred to the
viewer.
The Seven Percent Solution is
a noteworthy film, a cut above
most others for three reasons: (a)
because its originality shines
while others resemble dull car
bon copies, (b) because it is intel
ligent while most are ridicul
ously banal, and (c) because.it
refused to cut corners and de
grade itself for the sake of gim
mickry and sensationalism — a
rare attribute indeed.
