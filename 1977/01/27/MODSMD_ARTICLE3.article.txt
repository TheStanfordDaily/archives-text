If Bakke vs the Regents of the Uni
versity of California were heard and
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court,
"there would be very few, if any,
minority students in (professional)
schools throughout the nation," Ernest
Gelhorn, dean of law at Arizona State
University said Tuesday.
Gelhorn explained that "by the
standards of 10 years ago, there would
have been no problem (enrolling rep
resentative percentages of minority
students)" but that greater competi
tion for admission has raised stan
dards so high that few minority stu
dents can meet them.
According to a Report on Special
Admissions at Boalt Hall After Bakke
Oct. 5, 1976, "the number of blacks
and Mexican Americans admitted
under the regular program and who
eventually enroll has been in the order
of one or two each year."
The report is the result of a joint ef
fort by Jack Owens, law professor;
Roger Bait, a recent graduate; Prof. Jan
Vetter, the present chairman of the
Boalt Admissions Committee; Prof.
David Feller, an admissions commit
tee member; and Fran Layton, a first
year law student and prior Director of
Admissions at Boalt. All were chosen
by Boalt Law School Dean Sanford
Kadish.
At the law school here, a Law Quo

student based on the applicant's grade
point average, LSAT score, and the
quality of the student's undergraduate
institution as indicated on standar
dized statistical tables, explained Law
School Dean Charles Meyers.
50-point spread
The lowest non-minority LQI score
accepted for the present first-year class
was 1451. Almost any minority
applicant with an LQI within 50 points
of the lowest non-minority LQI will be
admitted, but Meyers said, "We don't
think it's fair to go much below that 50
points."
However, Law Prof. William Baxter
said that minority students that are ac
cepted are "sometimes four or five
hundred points" below the band.
Meyers said there was little attrition
in the Law School here, but whereas 95
per cent of non-minority graduates
here pass the bar examination on the
