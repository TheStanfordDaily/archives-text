# Alums make good
## Waterwheel has fluid style 
### Dean Eyre 
Waterwheel is an approp
riately descriptive name for both
the duo of Mark Hanson and
Fred Cummins and for the fluid
style that these artists have de
veloped for their first album.
Hanson, 24, was raised in
Minnesota and earned an A.B.
degree in music from Stanford in
1973. His musical career began
as a guitar player in junior high.
At Stanford, he learned music

theory, was a Mendicant, and
has recently been studying
under the tutelage of Bill Con
nors, a jazz guitarist who played
with Chick Correa.
Cummins, 25, and a native of
Pasadena, received an M.A. de
gree in music from Stanford in
1973. As a youngster in the fifth
grade, he played the string bass
in the traditional vertical posi
tion. In his junior year at Stan
ford, a university renowned for

its independent tradition, he
started playing the bass on his
knee, explaining it as "some
thing that happened."
Music major
For Cummins, majoring in
music at Stanford had addi
tional, unexpected fringe be
nefits: "I didn't have to focus on
a specific instrument. The result
was six quarters of private in
struction" on several different
instruments, two of which
would be critical for his album
debut.
Cummins and Hanson started
playing together professionally
in 1973. Both of them had sung
in the Mendicants and Hanson
"wrote a letter (to Fred)," indi
cating his admiration for Cum
mins' singing and bass playing.
Hanson suggested that "they get
together": the result is Water
wheel.
While certain individual ele
ments of the songs of the album
can be identified as classical,
folk, jazz, and blues, the delicate
blend of these styles results in
the creative performance of
Waterwheel.
The principal musical direc
tion of this album is a tranquil
and subdued collection of bal
lads, traditional, folk tunes and
original compositions by Han
son. One particularly critical
and unique facet of this album is
the set of ballads based upon
American and English poetry.
The impressionistic verses of
Wordsworth, Y.B. Yeats, Wil
liam Carlos Williams and Cary
Snyder are put to music with
equally evocative melodic ar
rangements. These ballads,
exemplified by "Nuns Fret Not"
by Wordsworth, reflect an Old
English, medieval melodic style.
The ballads serve as a sensitive
vehicle for Cummins' artistic
expression and music writing
ability.
The album's featured instru
ments reflect the understated

and introspective themes of the
songs: piano and string bass
(played by Cummins), six-string
and twelve-string guitars, har
monica (Hanson), mandolin
(Rick Bamman), and drums and
congo for percussion (Bob Garri
son).
There are four folk tunes
which are representative of the
high quality of the recordings on
this album. Although they share
similar musical roots, they offer
different characteristics. The
traditional "Shenandoah" fea
tures a mandolin solo by Rick
Bamman and fine vocals by
VVaterwheel to accompany their
guitar and bass playing.
Light jazz
"My Fortune," penned by
Hanson has a rhythm figure
which adds a light jazz feel to the
arrangement. The instrumental
portion between verses presents
a transition in rhythmic struc
ture and a strong running bass
line. Hanson has a selection of
lyrics describing a traveler's
longing for a return to his Mis
sissippi home.
Another traditional song, "Jay
Gould's Daughter," is creatively
arranged with harmonizing voc
als, a haunting harmonica recre
ation of a train whistle's wail by
Hanson, and a strong instrumen
tal section highlighted by a
transition in rhythm, giving the
clickety-clack feel of the train
tracks. While basically a folk
song, a bluegrass feel emerges
recalling the Southern and rural
origins of the lyrics.
"Say Goodbye," authored by
Hanson, includes a
rhythmic,finger-picked guitar
accompaniment to a lullaby
melody that recreates the style of
Peter, Paul, and Mary, and is un
iquely suited for such a mood.
Hanson wrote a blues number,
"Mississippi Paddleboat Blues,"
recalling the riverlife of gambl
ing and lost-card-game-blues.
The fine narrative lyrics are ba
lanced by off-beat syncopation
and improvisational solos on
piano by Cummins and on guitar
by Hanson.
Waterwheel stands as intrigu
ing a collection of original and
traditional music that reflects
and, more importantly, captures
the warmth and love for music
felt in the live performances by
Hanson and Cummins. For those
concerned about the preserva
tion and evolution of traditional
American folk music, this album
deserves a critical examination.
