# Mason to play at Winterland
## 
### John Baer Doug Apostol 
Dave Mason is synonymous with white soul.
His song, his delivery and his background flow
together to produce a special sort of rocky blues.
But Mason is more than the typical commercial
artist. With his quiet manner, he touches his audi
ence with musical insights into his personal life.
His creations are all intensely human, ranging
from the mixture of anger and perserverance, felt
in his "Show Me Some Affection," to the thought
ful and somber rhythm of his recent hit, "Give Me
a Reason Why."
Before attacking the musical world on his own,
Mason teamed with a variety of musical greats. He
emoted on the bass and sitar for Stevie Winwood
and Traffic. Later, he performed with Mama Cass,

Rita Coolidge, Graham Nash, and everyone's favo
rite, Ghris Mills (now the honored guest of Kairos
House.)
Once again it is the time for Mason. This Satur
day night Dave Mason returns to the San Fran
cisco stomping grounds at Winterland. Two years
ago his stirring performance was nothing less
than a sellout supershow. Supported by glowing
frisbees and a pungent smoke cloud, Mason kept
the audience on its feet for song after song. Then
with his exciting encore of "All Along the Watch
tower," he drew such thunderous applause that it
registered 4.2 on the Richter Scale centered in
north San Francisco.
Yes, the tranquil Mason is a maker of emotion.
This Saturday night is the perfect time to get
ready, to get psyched, and to experience Mason.
