Carter seeks new energy powers
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
asked Congress yesterday to give him
emergency authority to transfer natural gas to
areas with the worst gas shortages.
The legislation sent to Congress by the new
president also would allow intrastate pipelines
to make emergency gas sales to interstate lines
at unregulated prices until July 31 — a move
that could raise the monthly gas bills of natural
gas consumers.
Shortages of natural gas and other fuels con
tinued to worsen in the Midwest and East as a
new cold wave surged southward out of
Canada. Several states faced severe energy
shortages.
Pennsylvania Cov. Milton Shapp ordered all
public and private schools in the state to close
today and tomorrow to conserve energy.
Ohio Cov. James Rhodes called for prayers
"to get us through the coldest days of oar
time." He lifted environmental regulations to
allow fuel-starved businesses and residents to
bum air-polluting, high-sulfur coal.
Parts of Maryland and Virginia around the
Chesapeake Bay were declared federal disaster
areas yesterday because the bay is frozen, inter
fering with shipments of fuel and leaving
many boatmen and fishermen out of work.
Shipments of fuel oil and grain were still
blocked by heavy ice clogging the Mississippi
and Ohio rivers.
Rhodes also warned of another potential
hazard from the cold — spring floods could
carry massive ice floes capable of smashing the
bridges which span the Ohio River.
Carter asked Congress for emergency author
ity to transfer natural to areas with the worst
gas shortages. His proposal also would allow
intrastate pipelines to make emergency gas
sales to interstate lines at unregulated prices
until July 31.
Cabinet confirmations completed
Washington — The Senate completed con
firmation of President Jimmy Carter's Cabinet
yesterday by approving F. Ray Marshall as sec
retary of labor.
The 74-20 vote came after nearly five hours
of debate about organized labor's role in soci
ety and whether Marshall is too close to labor
to satisfy Senate conservatives.
Marshall, 48, is a University of Texas
economist.
Young receives ambassadorship
Washington — Former civil rights leader
Andrew Young Jr. was confirmed by the Senate
yesterday as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
His appointment "is a symbol of great prog
ress in civil rights and equality in our land,"
declared Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). "He is a
man of great and rare ability."
Young, 44, had once indicated a reluctance
to leave Congress, where he has served since
1973 from an Atlanta district.
But on one of his six trips to Africa, he said,
he realized the rest of the world anticipates

leadership from the Carter administration.
Young, a long-time political ally of President
Jimmy Carter, was approved on an 89 to 3 vote.
Dissenting were Sen. William Scott (R-Va.);
Carl Curtis (R-Neb.), and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).
Curtis said his opposition is "based on my
general opposition to his record on foreign pol
icy and national defense." Curtis previously
had expressed concern about the new ad
ministration's views of Vietnam.
Young told his confirmation hearing Tues
day that he hoped the United States would
move toward letting the Hanoi government
into the U.N. He said one of the issues still to be
settled is a report from the Vietnamese on
Americans missing in action.
Parole granted if Hunt pays fine
Washington — Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt will be released from prison Feb.
25 if he takes care of a $10,000 fine still pend
ing against him, the U.S. Parole Commission
announced yesterday.
The commission granted Hunt's petition for
parole from a prison term of 30 months to eight
years for his role in planning the June 1972
break-in at Democratic National Headquarters
in the Watergate building.
But the commission approved the parole
only if Hunt pays the fine or makes other ar
rangements with the court to dispose of it.
Justice Department spokesman Dean St. De
nnis said if Hunt is unable to pay the fine, he
could file a financial statement with a federal
prosecutor who would refer it to the court.
Under this procedure, a federal judge could
decide whether to reduce the fine, eliminate it
entirely, or adopt some arrangement requiring
payment on the installment plan.
In Miami, Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said
payment of the fine will be a problem for Hunt,
"but it will be made." He said Hunt did not
have much money at his disposal, but the
$10,000 will be found somewhere. He said
Hunt would return to Miami after his release.
He has spent about two and a half years be
hind bars after he pleaded guilty, Jan. 11,1973,
to charges stemming from the break-in.
House Demos vote to oust Sikes
Washington — Proponents of a tough ethics
code for members of Congress claimed a major
victory yesterday as House Democrats voted to
oust Rep. Robert Sikes of Florida from a key
subcommittee chairmanship.
Sikes lost on a 189-93 vote in his effort to
keep control of a panel that annually doles out
millions for construction of military facilities.
The challenge to Sikes grew out of a re
primand given him by the House last year for
misuse of influence in certain financial deal
ings.
"I'll tell you one thing, you're looking at a
very live corpse. . . . I've lost an election but
I'm not dead," Sikes said to reporters who
caught him in a hallway outside his office after
the caucus vote.
He blamed the defeat on opposition to his
advocacy of a strong national defense and "a
growing intolerance for the people who do not

support the straight liberal line of the Democ
ratic party."
The edge by which Sikes lost in the caucus
vote surprised even the most optimistic mem
bers of the reform group which viewed the case
as pivotal to its hopes to create a strict code of
conduct for legislators this year.

minister, goes on trial today charged with tak

of Lockheed aircraft in this country. He also is
charged with violations of foreign currency
regulations.
Tanaka has denied all charges.
Going on trial with Tanaka are his former
secretary, Toshio Enomoto, 50, and three
former executives of Marubeni. They are part
of 18 persons arrested as a result of the Loc
kheed investigation.

bulldozer" for his direct, aggressive manner,
served as prime minister from 1972 to 1974. He

little enforcement.
Tour of allies takes VP to Rome
Rome — Vice President Walter Mondale
paid a symbolic visit to the Berlin wall yester
day and then came to Italy, appealing for sub
stantial cuts in the sale of conventional
weapons.
After inspecting the Communist-built wall
separating East and West Berlin. Mondale said,
"We can only pray that progress will see the
day when this kind of wall will disappear and
that all people will be able to share the values
that we cherish, such as freedom and democ
racy."
Mondale held talks with Italian Premier
Giulio Andreotti and then said in a statement
the Carter administration hopes "the arms
producing nations of the world, including my

own, could cooperate for a program of substan
tially reduced sales of conventional arms
around the world."
Mondale sees Pope Paul VI today and then
flies to London for the fourth leg of his 10-
nation tour.
Woman may get high court post
Sacramento — A 40-year-old woman
member of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s cabinet
was widely reported yesterday as being in line
for one of two vacancies Brown will fill within
two weeks on the California Supreme Court.
Rose Elizabeth Bird, Brown's Agriculture
and Services Agency secretary, would become
the first woman on the California Supreme
Court bench.
The Sacramento Bee, citing unnamed
sources inside and outside the administration,
reported yesterday that Bird likely would be
named chief justice to succeed Donald Wright,
who retires Feb. 1.
Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, will make
the appointments "within two weeks," the Bee
reported.
UFW insurance assessment cut
Sacramento — A $940,000 assessment
against the United Farm Workers (UFW) of
America over unemployment insurance pay
ments has been cut to $101,953, but a UFW
spokesman said today it doesn't even owe a
dollar.
The state Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board announced more than a year ago it was
assessing Cesar Chavez' union the nearly $1
million figure.
A review of the UFW appeal resulted in the
90 per cent reduction, and the matter will be
heard by an administrative law judge March 2
in San Jose, board officials said.
"We owe nothing," UFW spokesman Marc
Grossman said. "It's just a gimmick by grow
ers."
Miami revives Indian* symbol
Oxford, Ohio — It's no longer in bad taste to
cheer an "Indian" at Miami University — as
long as he's been officially endorsed.
The Miami native American tribe of Ok
lahoma have authorized Miami University to
call its team "Redskins." They also have as
sured university officials they have no objec
tion to the school having a native American
dancer appear at athletic events as long as the
dances were authentic and respectful to native
American tradition.
University officials, in turn, have assured
tribal officials that the revival of the tradition
for university events will be "in keeping with
high standards of 'Indian' custom."
The mascot of athletic teams, "Chief
Miami," makes his reappearance Saturday at
the Miami-Eastern Michigan basketball game.
Several years ago, Miami's "Redskins" went
the way of Stanford's "Indians" and symbols
from many other schools which were dis
carded because of complaints that they were
demeaning to native Americans.

Miami has started over on a new image for its
mascot, seeking guidance from the original
source almost every step of the way.
The university invited and then hosted two
Miami chiefs, who offered advice when artist
John Ruthven was commissioned to paint an
official Miami "Indian."
Prints from that painting have created an
image far different from the once-popular
"rampant redskin" caricature School officials
say Chief Miami will not be a caricature, but
will enhance the school's reputation.
In addition, Miami has created an American
Heritage scholarship for a native American,
preferably a Miamian.

Miami revives Indian* symbol
Oxford, Ohio — It's no longer in bad taste to
cheer an "Indian" at Miami University — as
long as he's been officially endorsed.
The Miami native American tribe of Ok
lahoma have authorized Miami University to
call its team "Redskins." They also have as
sured university officials they have no objec
tion to the school having a native American
dancer appear at athletic events as long as the
dances were authentic and respectful to native
American tradition.
University officials, in turn, have assured
tribal officials that the revival of the tradition
for university events will be "in keeping with
high standards of 'Indian' custom."
The mascot of athletic teams, "Chief
Miami," makes his reappearance Saturday at
the Miami-Eastern Michigan basketball game.
Several years ago, Miami's "Redskins" went
the way of Stanford's "Indians" and symbols
from many other schools which were dis
carded because of complaints that they were
demeaning to native Americans.

Miami has started over on a new image for its
mascot, seeking guidance from the original
source almost every step of the way.
The university invited and then hosted two
Miami chiefs, who offered advice when artist
John Ruthven was commissioned to paint an
official Miami "Indian."
Prints from that painting have created an
image far different from the once-popular
"rampant redskin" caricature School officials
say Chief Miami will not be a caricature, but
will enhance the school's reputation.
In addition, Miami has created an American
Heritage scholarship for a native American,
preferably a Miamian.

Carter seeks new energy powers
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
asked Congress yesterday to give him
emergency authority to transfer natural gas to
areas with the worst gas shortages.
The legislation sent to Congress by the new
president also would allow intrastate pipelines
to make emergency gas sales to interstate lines
at unregulated prices until July 31 — a move
that could raise the monthly gas bills of natural
gas consumers.
Shortages of natural gas and other fuels con
tinued to worsen in the Midwest and East as a
new cold wave surged southward out of
Canada. Several states faced severe energy
shortages.
Pennsylvania Cov. Milton Shapp ordered all
public and private schools in the state to close
today and tomorrow to conserve energy.
Ohio Cov. James Rhodes called for prayers
"to get us through the coldest days of oar
time." He lifted environmental regulations to
allow fuel-starved businesses and residents to
bum air-polluting, high-sulfur coal.
Parts of Maryland and Virginia around the
Chesapeake Bay were declared federal disaster
areas yesterday because the bay is frozen, inter
fering with shipments of fuel and leaving
many boatmen and fishermen out of work.
Shipments of fuel oil and grain were still

and Ohio rivers.
Rhodes also warned of another potential
hazard from the cold — spring floods could
carry massive ice floes capable of smashing the
bridges which span the Ohio River.
Carter asked Congress for emergency author
ity to transfer natural to areas with the worst

Young receives ambassadorship
Washington — Former civil rights leader
Andrew Young Jr. was confirmed by the Senate
yesterday as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
His appointment "is a symbol of great prog
ress in civil rights and equality in our land,"
declared Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). "He is a
man of great and rare ability."
Young, 44, had once indicated a reluctance
to leave Congress, where he has served since
1973 from an Atlanta district.
But on one of his six trips to Africa, he said,
he realized the rest of the world anticipates

leadership from the Carter administration.
Young, a long-time political ally of President
Jimmy Carter, was approved on an 89 to 3 vote.
Dissenting were Sen. William Scott (R-Va.);
Carl Curtis (R-Neb.), and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).
Curtis said his opposition is "based on my
general opposition to his record on foreign pol
icy and national defense." Curtis previously
had expressed concern about the new ad
ministration's views of Vietnam.
Young told his confirmation hearing Tues
day that he hoped the United States would
move toward letting the Hanoi government
into the U.N. He said one of the issues still to be
settled is a report from the Vietnamese on
Americans missing in action.
Parole granted if Hunt pays fine
Washington — Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt will be released from prison Feb.
25 if he takes care of a $10,000 fine still pend
ing against him, the U.S. Parole Commission
announced yesterday.
The commission granted Hunt's petition for
parole from a prison term of 30 months to eight
years for his role in planning the June 1972
break-in at Democratic National Headquarters
in the Watergate building.
But the commission approved the parole
only if Hunt pays the fine or makes other ar
rangements with the court to dispose of it.
Justice Department spokesman Dean St. De
nnis said if Hunt is unable to pay the fine, he
could file a financial statement with a federal
prosecutor who would refer it to the court.
Under this procedure, a federal judge could
decide whether to reduce the fine, eliminate it
entirely, or adopt some arrangement requiring
payment on the installment plan.
In Miami, Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said
payment of the fine will be a problem for Hunt,
"but it will be made." He said Hunt did not
have much money at his disposal, but the
$10,000 will be found somewhere. He said
Hunt would return to Miami after his release.
He has spent about two and a half years be
hind bars after he pleaded guilty, Jan. 11,1973,
to charges stemming from the break-in.
House Demos vote to oust Sikes
Washington — Proponents of a tough ethics
code for members of Congress claimed a major
victory yesterday as House Democrats voted to
oust Rep. Robert Sikes of Florida from a key
subcommittee chairmanship.
Sikes lost on a 189-93 vote in his effort to
keep control of a panel that annually doles out
millions for construction of military facilities.
The challenge to Sikes grew out of a re
primand given him by the House last year for
misuse of influence in certain financial deal
ings.
"I'll tell you one thing, you're looking at a
very live corpse. . . . I've lost an election but
I'm not dead," Sikes said to reporters who
caught him in a hallway outside his office after
the caucus vote.
He blamed the defeat on opposition to his
advocacy of a strong national defense and "a
growing intolerance for the people who do not

support the straight liberal line of the Democ
ratic party."
The edge by which Sikes lost in the caucus
vote surprised even the most optimistic mem
bers of the reform group which viewed the case
as pivotal to its hopes to create a strict code of
conduct for legislators this year.
Japan PM bribe trial begins
Tokyo — Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime
minister, goes on trial today charged with tak
ing bribes in the Lockheed payoff scandal that
has rocked Japan's political world.
Tanaka, 58, is accused of having received

served as prime minister from 1972 to 1974. He
was arrested July 27, 1976, jailed and then re
leased on bail last Aug. 17.

Parole granted if Hunt pays fine
Washington — Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt will be released from prison Feb.
25 if he takes care of a $10,000 fine still pend
ing against him, the U.S. Parole Commission
announced yesterday.
The commission granted Hunt's petition for
parole from a prison term of 30 months to eight
years for his role in planning the June 1972
break-in at Democratic National Headquarters
in the Watergate building.
But the commission approved the parole
only if Hunt pays the fine or makes other ar
rangements with the court to dispose of it.
Justice Department spokesman Dean St. De
nnis said if Hunt is unable to pay the fine, he
could file a financial statement with a federal
prosecutor who would refer it to the court.
Under this procedure, a federal judge could
decide whether to reduce the fine, eliminate it
entirely, or adopt some arrangement requiring
payment on the installment plan.
In Miami, Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said
payment of the fine will be a problem for Hunt,
"but it will be made." He said Hunt did not
have much money at his disposal, but the
$10,000 will be found somewhere. He said
Hunt would return to Miami after his release.
He has spent about two and a half years be
hind bars after he pleaded guilty, Jan. 11,1973,
to charges stemming from the break-in.
House Demos vote to oust Sikes
Washington — Proponents of a tough ethics
code for members of Congress claimed a major
victory yesterday as House Democrats voted to
oust Rep. Robert Sikes of Florida from a key
subcommittee chairmanship.
Sikes lost on a 189-93 vote in his effort to
keep control of a panel that annually doles out
millions for construction of military facilities.
The challenge to Sikes grew out of a re
primand given him by the House last year for
misuse of influence in certain financial deal
ings.
"I'll tell you one thing, you're looking at a
very live corpse. . . . I've lost an election but
I'm not dead," Sikes said to reporters who
caught him in a hallway outside his office after
the caucus vote.
He blamed the defeat on opposition to his
advocacy of a strong national defense and "a
growing intolerance for the people who do not

support the straight liberal line of the Democ
ratic party."
The edge by which Sikes lost in the caucus
vote surprised even the most optimistic mem
bers of the reform group which viewed the case
as pivotal to its hopes to create a strict code of
conduct for legislators this year.

UFW insurance assessment cut
Sacramento — A $940,000 assessment
against the United Farm Workers (UFW) of
America over unemployment insurance pay

spokesman said today it doesn't even owe a
dollar.
The state Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board announced more than a year ago it was
assessing Cesar Chavez' union the nearly $1
million figure.
A review of the UFW appeal resulted in the

Miami revives Indian* symbol
Oxford, Ohio — It's no longer in bad taste to
cheer an "Indian" at Miami University — as
long as he's been officially endorsed.
The Miami native American tribe of Ok
lahoma have authorized Miami University to
call its team "Redskins." They also have as
sured university officials they have no objec
tion to the school having a native American
dancer appear at athletic events as long as the
dances were authentic and respectful to native
American tradition.
University officials, in turn, have assured
tribal officials that the revival of the tradition
for university events will be "in keeping with
high standards of 'Indian' custom."
The mascot of athletic teams, "Chief
Miami," makes his reappearance Saturday at
the Miami-Eastern Michigan basketball game.
Several years ago, Miami's "Redskins" went
the way of Stanford's "Indians" and symbols
from many other schools which were dis
carded because of complaints that they were
demeaning to native Americans.

Miami has started over on a new image for its
mascot, seeking guidance from the original
source almost every step of the way.
The university invited and then hosted two
Miami chiefs, who offered advice when artist
John Ruthven was commissioned to paint an
official Miami "Indian."
Prints from that painting have created an
image far different from the once-popular
"rampant redskin" caricature School officials
say Chief Miami will not be a caricature, but
will enhance the school's reputation.
In addition, Miami has created an American
Heritage scholarship for a native American,
preferably a Miamian.

Carter seeks new energy powers
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
asked Congress yesterday to give him
emergency authority to transfer natural gas to
areas with the worst gas shortages.
The legislation sent to Congress by the new
president also would allow intrastate pipelines
to make emergency gas sales to interstate lines
at unregulated prices until July 31 — a move
that could raise the monthly gas bills of natural
gas consumers.
Shortages of natural gas and other fuels con
tinued to worsen in the Midwest and East as a
new cold wave surged southward out of
Canada. Several states faced severe energy
shortages.
Pennsylvania Cov. Milton Shapp ordered all
public and private schools in the state to close
today and tomorrow to conserve energy.
Ohio Cov. James Rhodes called for prayers
"to get us through the coldest days of oar
time." He lifted environmental regulations to
allow fuel-starved businesses and residents to
bum air-polluting, high-sulfur coal.
Parts of Maryland and Virginia around the
Chesapeake Bay were declared federal disaster
areas yesterday because the bay is frozen, inter
fering with shipments of fuel and leaving
many boatmen and fishermen out of work.
Shipments of fuel oil and grain were still
blocked by heavy ice clogging the Mississippi
and Ohio rivers.
Rhodes also warned of another potential
hazard from the cold — spring floods could
carry massive ice floes capable of smashing the
bridges which span the Ohio River.
Carter asked Congress for emergency author
ity to transfer natural to areas with the worst
gas shortages. His proposal also would allow
intrastate pipelines to make emergency gas
sales to interstate lines at unregulated prices
until July 31.
Cabinet confirmations completed
Washington — The Senate completed con
firmation of President Jimmy Carter's Cabinet
yesterday by approving F. Ray Marshall as sec

The 74-20 vote came after nearly five hours

ety and whether Marshall is too close to labor
to satisfy Senate conservatives.
Marshall, 48, is a University of Texas
economist.
Young receives ambassadorship
Washington — Former civil rights leader
Andrew Young Jr. was confirmed by the Senate
yesterday as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
His appointment "is a symbol of great prog
ress in civil rights and equality in our land,"
declared Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). "He is a
man of great and rare ability."
Young, 44, had once indicated a reluctance
to leave Congress, where he has served since
1973 from an Atlanta district.
But on one of his six trips to Africa, he said,
he realized the rest of the world anticipates

leadership from the Carter administration.
Young, a long-time political ally of President
Jimmy Carter, was approved on an 89 to 3 vote.
Dissenting were Sen. William Scott (R-Va.);
Carl Curtis (R-Neb.), and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).
Curtis said his opposition is "based on my
general opposition to his record on foreign pol
icy and national defense." Curtis previously
had expressed concern about the new ad
ministration's views of Vietnam.
Young told his confirmation hearing Tues
day that he hoped the United States would
move toward letting the Hanoi government
into the U.N. He said one of the issues still to be
settled is a report from the Vietnamese on
Americans missing in action.

Carter seeks new energy powers
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
asked Congress yesterday to give him
emergency authority to transfer natural gas to
areas with the worst gas shortages.
The legislation sent to Congress by the new
president also would allow intrastate pipelines
to make emergency gas sales to interstate lines
at unregulated prices until July 31 — a move
that could raise the monthly gas bills of natural
gas consumers.
Shortages of natural gas and other fuels con
tinued to worsen in the Midwest and East as a
new cold wave surged southward out of
Canada. Several states faced severe energy
shortages.
Pennsylvania Cov. Milton Shapp ordered all
public and private schools in the state to close
today and tomorrow to conserve energy.
Ohio Cov. James Rhodes called for prayers
"to get us through the coldest days of oar
time." He lifted environmental regulations to
allow fuel-starved businesses and residents to
bum air-polluting, high-sulfur coal.
Parts of Maryland and Virginia around the
Chesapeake Bay were declared federal disaster
areas yesterday because the bay is frozen, inter
fering with shipments of fuel and leaving
many boatmen and fishermen out of work.
Shipments of fuel oil and grain were still
blocked by heavy ice clogging the Mississippi
and Ohio rivers.
Rhodes also warned of another potential
hazard from the cold — spring floods could
carry massive ice floes capable of smashing the
bridges which span the Ohio River.
Carter asked Congress for emergency author
ity to transfer natural to areas with the worst
gas shortages. His proposal also would allow
intrastate pipelines to make emergency gas

Young receives ambassadorship
Washington — Former civil rights leader
Andrew Young Jr. was confirmed by the Senate
yesterday as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
His appointment "is a symbol of great prog
ress in civil rights and equality in our land,"
declared Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). "He is a
man of great and rare ability."
Young, 44, had once indicated a reluctance
to leave Congress, where he has served since
1973 from an Atlanta district.
But on one of his six trips to Africa, he said,
he realized the rest of the world anticipates

leadership from the Carter administration.
Young, a long-time political ally of President
Jimmy Carter, was approved on an 89 to 3 vote.
Dissenting were Sen. William Scott (R-Va.);
Carl Curtis (R-Neb.), and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).
Curtis said his opposition is "based on my
general opposition to his record on foreign pol
icy and national defense." Curtis previously
had expressed concern about the new ad
ministration's views of Vietnam.
Young told his confirmation hearing Tues
day that he hoped the United States would

Parole granted if Hunt pays fine
Washington — Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt will be released from prison Feb.
25 if he takes care of a $10,000 fine still pend
ing against him, the U.S. Parole Commission
announced yesterday.
The commission granted Hunt's petition for
parole from a prison term of 30 months to eight
years for his role in planning the June 1972
break-in at Democratic National Headquarters
in the Watergate building.
But the commission approved the parole
only if Hunt pays the fine or makes other ar
rangements with the court to dispose of it.
Justice Department spokesman Dean St. De
nnis said if Hunt is unable to pay the fine, he
could file a financial statement with a federal
prosecutor who would refer it to the court.
Under this procedure, a federal judge could
decide whether to reduce the fine, eliminate it
entirely, or adopt some arrangement requiring
payment on the installment plan.
In Miami, Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said
payment of the fine will be a problem for Hunt,
"but it will be made." He said Hunt did not
have much money at his disposal, but the
$10,000 will be found somewhere. He said
Hunt would return to Miami after his release.
He has spent about two and a half years be
hind bars after he pleaded guilty, Jan. 11,1973,
to charges stemming from the break-in.
House Demos vote to oust Sikes
Washington — Proponents of a tough ethics
code for members of Congress claimed a major
victory yesterday as House Democrats voted to
oust Rep. Robert Sikes of Florida from a key
subcommittee chairmanship.
Sikes lost on a 189-93 vote in his effort to
keep control of a panel that annually doles out
millions for construction of military facilities.
The challenge to Sikes grew out of a re
primand given him by the House last year for
misuse of influence in certain financial deal
ings.
"I'll tell you one thing, you're looking at a
very live corpse. . . . I've lost an election but
I'm not dead," Sikes said to reporters who
caught him in a hallway outside his office after
the caucus vote.
He blamed the defeat on opposition to his
advocacy of a strong national defense and "a
growing intolerance for the people who do not

support the straight liberal line of the Democ
ratic party."
The edge by which Sikes lost in the caucus
vote surprised even the most optimistic mem
bers of the reform group which viewed the case
as pivotal to its hopes to create a strict code of
conduct for legislators this year.
Japan PM bribe trial begins
Tokyo — Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime
minister, goes on trial today charged with tak
ing bribes in the Lockheed payoff scandal that

of Lockheed aircraft in this country. He also is
charged with violations of foreign currency
regulations.
Tanaka has denied all charges.
Going on trial with Tanaka are his former
secretary, Toshio Enomoto, 50, and three
former executives of Marubeni. They are part
of 18 persons arrested as a result of the Loc
kheed investigation.
Tanaka, once known as the "computerized

education and welfare announced plans yes

the poor.
HEW Secretary Joseph Califano Jr. said the

sions on what specific reforms will be prop
osed.
The secretary, who was sworn in on Tues

HEW's powerful Office for Civil Rights, where
he said there is "too much data collection, too
little enforcement.
Tour of allies takes VP to Rome
Rome — Vice President Walter Mondale
paid a symbolic visit to the Berlin wall yester
day and then came to Italy, appealing for sub
stantial cuts in the sale of conventional
weapons.
After inspecting the Communist-built wall
separating East and West Berlin. Mondale said,
"We can only pray that progress will see the
day when this kind of wall will disappear and
that all people will be able to share the values
that we cherish, such as freedom and democ
racy."
Mondale held talks with Italian Premier
Giulio Andreotti and then said in a statement
the Carter administration hopes "the arms
producing nations of the world, including my

own, could cooperate for a program of substan
tially reduced sales of conventional arms
around the world."
Mondale sees Pope Paul VI today and then
flies to London for the fourth leg of his 10-

Woman may get high court post
Sacramento — A 40-year-old woman
member of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s cabinet
was widely reported yesterday as being in line
for one of two vacancies Brown will fill within
two weeks on the California Supreme Court.
Rose Elizabeth Bird, Brown's Agriculture
and Services Agency secretary, would become
the first woman on the California Supreme
Court bench.
The Sacramento Bee, citing unnamed
sources inside and outside the administration,
reported yesterday that Bird likely would be

who retires Feb. 1.
Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, will make
the appointments "within two weeks," the Bee
reported.
UFW insurance assessment cut
Sacramento — A $940,000 assessment
against the United Farm Workers (UFW) of
America over unemployment insurance pay
ments has been cut to $101,953, but a UFW
spokesman said today it doesn't even owe a
dollar.
The state Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board announced more than a year ago it was
assessing Cesar Chavez' union the nearly $1
million figure.
A review of the UFW appeal resulted in the
90 per cent reduction, and the matter will be
heard by an administrative law judge March 2
in San Jose, board officials said.
"We owe nothing," UFW spokesman Marc
Grossman said. "It's just a gimmick by grow
ers."
Miami revives Indian* symbol
Oxford, Ohio — It's no longer in bad taste to
cheer an "Indian" at Miami University — as
long as he's been officially endorsed.
The Miami native American tribe of Ok
lahoma have authorized Miami University to
call its team "Redskins." They also have as

UFW insurance assessment cut
Sacramento — A $940,000 assessment
against the United Farm Workers (UFW) of
America over unemployment insurance pay

Miami revives Indian* symbol
Oxford, Ohio — It's no longer in bad taste to
cheer an "Indian" at Miami University — as
long as he's been officially endorsed.
The Miami native American tribe of Ok
lahoma have authorized Miami University to
call its team "Redskins." They also have as
sured university officials they have no objec
tion to the school having a native American
dancer appear at athletic events as long as the
dances were authentic and respectful to native
American tradition.
University officials, in turn, have assured
tribal officials that the revival of the tradition
for university events will be "in keeping with
high standards of 'Indian' custom."
The mascot of athletic teams, "Chief
Miami," makes his reappearance Saturday at
the Miami-Eastern Michigan basketball game.
Several years ago, Miami's "Redskins" went
the way of Stanford's "Indians" and symbols
from many other schools which were dis
carded because of complaints that they were
demeaning to native Americans.

Miami has started over on a new image for its
mascot, seeking guidance from the original
source almost every step of the way.
The university invited and then hosted two
Miami chiefs, who offered advice when artist
John Ruthven was commissioned to paint an
official Miami "Indian."
Prints from that painting have created an
image far different from the once-popular
"rampant redskin" caricature School officials
say Chief Miami will not be a caricature, but
will enhance the school's reputation.
In addition, Miami has created an American
Heritage scholarship for a native American,
preferably a Miamian.

Carter seeks new energy powers
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
asked Congress yesterday to give him
emergency authority to transfer natural gas to
areas with the worst gas shortages.
The legislation sent to Congress by the new
president also would allow intrastate pipelines
to make emergency gas sales to interstate lines
at unregulated prices until July 31 — a move
that could raise the monthly gas bills of natural
gas consumers.
Shortages of natural gas and other fuels con
tinued to worsen in the Midwest and East as a
new cold wave surged southward out of
Canada. Several states faced severe energy
shortages.
Pennsylvania Cov. Milton Shapp ordered all
public and private schools in the state to close
today and tomorrow to conserve energy.
Ohio Cov. James Rhodes called for prayers
"to get us through the coldest days of oar
time." He lifted environmental regulations to
allow fuel-starved businesses and residents to
bum air-polluting, high-sulfur coal.
Parts of Maryland and Virginia around the
Chesapeake Bay were declared federal disaster
areas yesterday because the bay is frozen, inter
fering with shipments of fuel and leaving
many boatmen and fishermen out of work.
Shipments of fuel oil and grain were still
blocked by heavy ice clogging the Mississippi
and Ohio rivers.
Rhodes also warned of another potential
hazard from the cold — spring floods could
carry massive ice floes capable of smashing the
bridges which span the Ohio River.
Carter asked Congress for emergency author
ity to transfer natural to areas with the worst
gas shortages. His proposal also would allow
intrastate pipelines to make emergency gas
sales to interstate lines at unregulated prices
until July 31.
Cabinet confirmations completed
Washington — The Senate completed con
firmation of President Jimmy Carter's Cabinet
yesterday by approving F. Ray Marshall as sec
retary of labor.
The 74-20 vote came after nearly five hours
of debate about organized labor's role in soci
ety and whether Marshall is too close to labor
to satisfy Senate conservatives.
Marshall, 48, is a University of Texas
economist.
Young receives ambassadorship
Washington — Former civil rights leader
Andrew Young Jr. was confirmed by the Senate
yesterday as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
His appointment "is a symbol of great prog
ress in civil rights and equality in our land,"
declared Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). "He is a
man of great and rare ability."
Young, 44, had once indicated a reluctance
to leave Congress, where he has served since
1973 from an Atlanta district.
But on one of his six trips to Africa, he said,
he realized the rest of the world anticipates

leadership from the Carter administration.
Young, a long-time political ally of President
Jimmy Carter, was approved on an 89 to 3 vote.
Dissenting were Sen. William Scott (R-Va.);
Carl Curtis (R-Neb.), and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).
Curtis said his opposition is "based on my
general opposition to his record on foreign pol
icy and national defense." Curtis previously
had expressed concern about the new ad
ministration's views of Vietnam.
Young told his confirmation hearing Tues
day that he hoped the United States would
move toward letting the Hanoi government
into the U.N. He said one of the issues still to be
settled is a report from the Vietnamese on
Americans missing in action.
Parole granted if Hunt pays fine
Washington — Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt will be released from prison Feb.
25 if he takes care of a $10,000 fine still pend
ing against him, the U.S. Parole Commission
announced yesterday.
The commission granted Hunt's petition for
parole from a prison term of 30 months to eight
years for his role in planning the June 1972
break-in at Democratic National Headquarters
in the Watergate building.
But the commission approved the parole
only if Hunt pays the fine or makes other ar
rangements with the court to dispose of it.
Justice Department spokesman Dean St. De
nnis said if Hunt is unable to pay the fine, he
could file a financial statement with a federal
prosecutor who would refer it to the court.
Under this procedure, a federal judge could
decide whether to reduce the fine, eliminate it
entirely, or adopt some arrangement requiring
payment on the installment plan.
In Miami, Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said
payment of the fine will be a problem for Hunt,
"but it will be made." He said Hunt did not
have much money at his disposal, but the
$10,000 will be found somewhere. He said
Hunt would return to Miami after his release.
He has spent about two and a half years be
hind bars after he pleaded guilty, Jan. 11,1973,
to charges stemming from the break-in.
House Demos vote to oust Sikes
Washington — Proponents of a tough ethics
code for members of Congress claimed a major
victory yesterday as House Democrats voted to
oust Rep. Robert Sikes of Florida from a key
subcommittee chairmanship.
Sikes lost on a 189-93 vote in his effort to
keep control of a panel that annually doles out
millions for construction of military facilities.
The challenge to Sikes grew out of a re
primand given him by the House last year for
misuse of influence in certain financial deal
ings.
"I'll tell you one thing, you're looking at a
very live corpse. . . . I've lost an election but
I'm not dead," Sikes said to reporters who
caught him in a hallway outside his office after
the caucus vote.
He blamed the defeat on opposition to his
advocacy of a strong national defense and "a
growing intolerance for the people who do not

support the straight liberal line of the Democ
ratic party."
The edge by which Sikes lost in the caucus
vote surprised even the most optimistic mem
bers of the reform group which viewed the case
as pivotal to its hopes to create a strict code of
conduct for legislators this year.

bum air-polluting, high-sulfur coal.
Parts of Maryland and Virginia around the
Chesapeake Bay were declared federal disaster
areas yesterday because the bay is frozen, inter
fering with shipments of fuel and leaving
many boatmen and fishermen out of work.
Shipments of fuel oil and grain were still
blocked by heavy ice clogging the Mississippi
and Ohio rivers.
Rhodes also warned of another potential
hazard from the cold — spring floods could
carry massive ice floes capable of smashing the
bridges which span the Ohio River.
Carter asked Congress for emergency author
ity to transfer natural to areas with the worst
gas shortages. His proposal also would allow
intrastate pipelines to make emergency gas
sales to interstate lines at unregulated prices
until July 31.
Cabinet confirmations completed
Washington — The Senate completed con
firmation of President Jimmy Carter's Cabinet
yesterday by approving F. Ray Marshall as sec
retary of labor.
The 74-20 vote came after nearly five hours
of debate about organized labor's role in soci
ety and whether Marshall is too close to labor
to satisfy Senate conservatives.
Marshall, 48, is a University of Texas
economist.
Young receives ambassadorship
Washington — Former civil rights leader
Andrew Young Jr. was confirmed by the Senate
yesterday as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
His appointment "is a symbol of great prog
ress in civil rights and equality in our land,"
declared Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). "He is a
man of great and rare ability."
Young, 44, had once indicated a reluctance
to leave Congress, where he has served since
1973 from an Atlanta district.
But on one of his six trips to Africa, he said,
he realized the rest of the world anticipates

leadership from the Carter administration.
Young, a long-time political ally of President
Jimmy Carter, was approved on an 89 to 3 vote.
Dissenting were Sen. William Scott (R-Va.);
Carl Curtis (R-Neb.), and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).
Curtis said his opposition is "based on my
general opposition to his record on foreign pol
icy and national defense." Curtis previously
had expressed concern about the new ad
ministration's views of Vietnam.
Young told his confirmation hearing Tues
day that he hoped the United States would
move toward letting the Hanoi government
into the U.N. He said one of the issues still to be
settled is a report from the Vietnamese on
Americans missing in action.
Parole granted if Hunt pays fine
Washington — Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt will be released from prison Feb.
25 if he takes care of a $10,000 fine still pend
ing against him, the U.S. Parole Commission
announced yesterday.
The commission granted Hunt's petition for
parole from a prison term of 30 months to eight
years for his role in planning the June 1972
break-in at Democratic National Headquarters
in the Watergate building.
But the commission approved the parole
only if Hunt pays the fine or makes other ar
rangements with the court to dispose of it.
Justice Department spokesman Dean St. De
nnis said if Hunt is unable to pay the fine, he
could file a financial statement with a federal
prosecutor who would refer it to the court.
Under this procedure, a federal judge could
decide whether to reduce the fine, eliminate it
entirely, or adopt some arrangement requiring
payment on the installment plan.
In Miami, Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said
payment of the fine will be a problem for Hunt,
"but it will be made." He said Hunt did not
have much money at his disposal, but the
$10,000 will be found somewhere. He said
Hunt would return to Miami after his release.
He has spent about two and a half years be
hind bars after he pleaded guilty, Jan. 11,1973,
to charges stemming from the break-in.
House Demos vote to oust Sikes
Washington — Proponents of a tough ethics
code for members of Congress claimed a major
victory yesterday as House Democrats voted to
oust Rep. Robert Sikes of Florida from a key
subcommittee chairmanship.
Sikes lost on a 189-93 vote in his effort to
keep control of a panel that annually doles out
millions for construction of military facilities.
The challenge to Sikes grew out of a re
primand given him by the House last year for
misuse of influence in certain financial deal
ings.
"I'll tell you one thing, you're looking at a
very live corpse. . . . I've lost an election but
I'm not dead," Sikes said to reporters who
caught him in a hallway outside his office after
the caucus vote.
He blamed the defeat on opposition to his
advocacy of a strong national defense and "a
growing intolerance for the people who do not

support the straight liberal line of the Democ
ratic party."
The edge by which Sikes lost in the caucus
vote surprised even the most optimistic mem
bers of the reform group which viewed the case
as pivotal to its hopes to create a strict code of
conduct for legislators this year.
Japan PM bribe trial begins
Tokyo — Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime
minister, goes on trial today charged with tak
ing bribes in the Lockheed payoff scandal that
has rocked Japan's political world.
Tanaka, 58, is accused of having received
$1.7 million in bribes from the Lockheed Air

of Lockheed aircraft in this country. He also is
charged with violations of foreign currency
regulations.

secretary, Toshio Enomoto, 50, and three
former executives of Marubeni. They are part
of 18 persons arrested as a result of the Loc

bulldozer" for his direct, aggressive manner,
served as prime minister from 1972 to 1974. He

leased on bail last Aug. 17.
HEW plans major welfare study
Washington — The new secretary of health,
education and welfare announced plans yes
terday for a major study of the U.S. welfare
system to produce recommendations on how
President Jimmy Carter should carry out his
campaign pledge to overhaul aid programs for
the poor.
HEW Secretary Joseph Califano Jr. said the
recommendations will go to Carter by May 1.
Califano, in his first news conference as head
of the government's largest department, said
he will take responsibility for making the deci
sions on what specific reforms will be prop
osed.
The secretary, who was sworn in on Tues
day, also announced he plans to restructure
HEW's powerful Office for Civil Rights, where
he said there is "too much data collection, too
little enforcement.
Tour of allies takes VP to Rome
Rome — Vice President Walter Mondale
paid a symbolic visit to the Berlin wall yester
day and then came to Italy, appealing for sub
stantial cuts in the sale of conventional
weapons.
After inspecting the Communist-built wall
separating East and West Berlin. Mondale said,
"We can only pray that progress will see the
day when this kind of wall will disappear and
that all people will be able to share the values
that we cherish, such as freedom and democ
racy."
Mondale held talks with Italian Premier
Giulio Andreotti and then said in a statement
the Carter administration hopes "the arms
producing nations of the world, including my

own, could cooperate for a program of substan
tially reduced sales of conventional arms
around the world."
Mondale sees Pope Paul VI today and then
flies to London for the fourth leg of his 10-
nation tour.
Woman may get high court post
Sacramento — A 40-year-old woman
member of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s cabinet
was widely reported yesterday as being in line
for one of two vacancies Brown will fill within
two weeks on the California Supreme Court.
Rose Elizabeth Bird, Brown's Agriculture
and Services Agency secretary, would become
the first woman on the California Supreme
Court bench.
The Sacramento Bee, citing unnamed
sources inside and outside the administration,
reported yesterday that Bird likely would be
named chief justice to succeed Donald Wright,
who retires Feb. 1.
Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, will make
the appointments "within two weeks," the Bee
reported.
UFW insurance assessment cut
Sacramento — A $940,000 assessment
against the United Farm Workers (UFW) of
America over unemployment insurance pay
ments has been cut to $101,953, but a UFW
spokesman said today it doesn't even owe a
dollar.
The state Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board announced more than a year ago it was
assessing Cesar Chavez' union the nearly $1
million figure.
A review of the UFW appeal resulted in the
90 per cent reduction, and the matter will be
heard by an administrative law judge March 2
in San Jose, board officials said.
"We owe nothing," UFW spokesman Marc
Grossman said. "It's just a gimmick by grow
ers."
Miami revives Indian* symbol
Oxford, Ohio — It's no longer in bad taste to
cheer an "Indian" at Miami University — as
long as he's been officially endorsed.
The Miami native American tribe of Ok
lahoma have authorized Miami University to
call its team "Redskins." They also have as
sured university officials they have no objec
tion to the school having a native American
dancer appear at athletic events as long as the
dances were authentic and respectful to native
American tradition.
University officials, in turn, have assured
tribal officials that the revival of the tradition
for university events will be "in keeping with
high standards of 'Indian' custom."
The mascot of athletic teams, "Chief
Miami," makes his reappearance Saturday at
the Miami-Eastern Michigan basketball game.
Several years ago, Miami's "Redskins" went
the way of Stanford's "Indians" and symbols
from many other schools which were dis
carded because of complaints that they were
demeaning to native Americans.

Miami has started over on a new image for its
mascot, seeking guidance from the original
source almost every step of the way.
The university invited and then hosted two
Miami chiefs, who offered advice when artist
John Ruthven was commissioned to paint an
official Miami "Indian."
Prints from that painting have created an
image far different from the once-popular
"rampant redskin" caricature School officials
say Chief Miami will not be a caricature, but
will enhance the school's reputation.
In addition, Miami has created an American
Heritage scholarship for a native American,
preferably a Miamian.
