# New recycling program set
## 
### Mark Schleiss Staff writer 
A new program is being developed by students here
that would expand recycling efforts on campus.
The Stanford Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling
Program (SWERP) is a volunteer group organized and
headed by students Roy Skogstrom and Katy Swaim.
The main objective of SWERP is to broaden current
recycling of paper and solid waste.
The organization is a product of SWOPSI class 1728,
which is open to everyone on campus interested in
recycling, said Skogstrom. The class, "A Recycling
Plan for Stanford," plans to work in conjunction with
the current recycling program here, Alpha Place.
Skogstrom, a class member, stated that SWERP had
two main goals.
"Our primary objective is to expand the present re
cycling at Alpha Place by including more dorms, resi
dences and offices," Skogstrom said. Alpha Place is
currently the only group collecting recycleable mate
rials here.
Reduce waste
The second goal, according to Skogstrom, is to assist
the SWOPSI class in planning and initiating a
university-wide program for solid waste recycling and
to assist in making recommendations to university of
ficials on ways to reduce the solid waste production at
the university.
"Our eventual goal," said Skogstrom, "is to incorpo
rate Alpha Place into the SWOPSI program under the
common name of SWERP. This plan isn't very clear yet,

but we would pay Alpha Place for their share of the
work."
Alpha Place, a volunteer organization, raises money
to train the handicapped, and has collection deposits
for glass, aluminum and paper throughout the campus.
A chief goal of SWERP is to place bins in more loca
tions.
Skogstrom stated that people are needed to help the
SWERP program. "Right now we need all the people
we can get to expand the Alpha Place project to all the
dorms, and we have things to do for every possible
volunteer."
Skogstrom said that Alpha Place currently could
reach only about half the dorms, and at least two people
from each residence on campus are needed to be in
charge of the Alpha Place collection bins.
Meetings
The first meeting for all those interested in the
SWERP recycling project is Monday at 2:30 at Alpha
Place on Pampas Lane. All those interested in working
on the SWERP volunteer bureau for Alpha Place should
call Roy Skogstrom at 329-1791 or Katy Swaim at 327-
9753.
The SWOPSI class is taught by Howard Selznick and
Jeff Norment. Norment is a student at Santa Cruz Uni
versity with experience in many recycling programs
and Selznick is an environmental engineer with the
Metcalf-Eddy firm.
"Our overall program is still in the planning stage,
but by the end of the quarter we hope to have a specific
plan to help supplement the Alpha program," said
Selznick.

The organization is a product of SWOPSI class 1728,
which is open to everyone on campus interested in
recycling, said Skogstrom. The class, "A Recycling
Plan for Stanford," plans to work in conjunction with
the current recycling program here, Alpha Place.
Skogstrom, a class member, stated that SWERP had
two main goals.
"Our primary objective is to expand the present re
cycling at Alpha Place by including more dorms, resi
dences and offices," Skogstrom said. Alpha Place is
currently the only group collecting recycleable mate
rials here.
Reduce waste
The second goal, according to Skogstrom, is to assist
the SWOPSI class in planning and initiating a
university-wide program for solid waste recycling and
to assist in making recommendations to university of
ficials on ways to reduce the solid waste production at
the university.
"Our eventual goal," said Skogstrom, "is to incorpo
rate Alpha Place into the SWOPSI program under the
common name of SWERP. This plan isn't very clear yet,

but we would pay Alpha Place for their share of the
work."
Alpha Place, a volunteer organization, raises money
to train the handicapped, and has collection deposits
for glass, aluminum and paper throughout the campus.
A chief goal of SWERP is to place bins in more loca
tions.
Skogstrom stated that people are needed to help the
SWERP program. "Right now we need all the people
we can get to expand the Alpha Place project to all the
dorms, and we have things to do for every possible
volunteer."
Skogstrom said that Alpha Place currently could
reach only about half the dorms, and at least two people
from each residence on campus are needed to be in
charge of the Alpha Place collection bins.
Meetings
The first meeting for all those interested in the
SWERP recycling project is Monday at 2:30 at Alpha
Place on Pampas Lane. All those interested in working
on the SWERP volunteer bureau for Alpha Place should
call Roy Skogstrom at 329-1791 or Katy Swaim at 327-
9753.
The SWOPSI class is taught by Howard Selznick and
Jeff Norment. Norment is a student at Santa Cruz Uni
versity with experience in many recycling programs
and Selznick is an environmental engineer with the
Metcalf-Eddy firm.
"Our overall program is still in the planning stage,
but by the end of the quarter we hope to have a specific
plan to help supplement the Alpha program," said
Selznick.
