# Minority enrollment may drop if discrimination case upheld
## 
### 
first try, only 62.5 per cent of the
minority students do likewise.
Some minority students do meet the
same admissions standards as non
minority applicants, according to
Thelton Henderson, assistant dean at
the Law School. Meyers, in a letter to
minority alumni, wrote that the prob
lem of minority enrollment "was
twofold: (1) the pool of qualified
applicants was too small and (2) the
yield rate (the number of accepted stu
dents enrolling) from the pool of ad
mittees was too small.
"Stanford is handicapped by its
suburban location and paradoxically,
by the small size of its student body,
which inevitably causes the absolute
number of minority students to be
smaller," he continued.
Too little, too late
Henderson said he thinks "we've
been contacting (minority students) a
little too late" so that they have already
decided to attend another school.
In addition, "there seems to be some
decline in minority interest in legal
education that appears to be nation
wide," Meyers said.
For this year, 3193 students applied
to the Law School, of which 399 were
minorities, Henderson said. Of the 160
students enrolled, four are black and
11 are Chicano.
The Law School has stepped up its

recruitment efforts, but will not ap
point a full-time administrator for re
cruitment until Bcikke is resolved, said
Meyers. The faculty decided last
month to continue the present admis
sions policy until a decision is
reached, he added.
In a letter to the president of the As
sociation of American Law Schools
(AALS) and the president of the Law
School Admission Council, Meyers
said that "if the United States Supreme
Court affirms Bakke, the constitutional
law experts around here believe that it
is just a matter of time before private
universities are made subject to Four
teenth Amendment standards under
Section 1981 or Title VI of the 1964
(Civil Rights) Act or both." Both mea
sures prohibit discrimination on the
basis of race.
No other alternative
Meyers also said, however, that at
some future time "special admissions
programs may survive Constitutional
challenge because it can be de
monstrated that few, if any, minorities
will be admitted other than by prog
rams employing racial classifica
tions."
No other admissions programs have
been devised that would yield suffi
cient minority students without a
"race-conscious" factor, Gelhorn said.
