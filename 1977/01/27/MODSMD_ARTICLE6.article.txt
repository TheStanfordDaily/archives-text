# C-15 reconvenes over private hearings issue
## 
### Mike Chartson Staff writer 
The Committee of Fifteen (C-l 5) has
reconvened at the request of university
President Richard Lyman and is dis
cussing whether students should have
the right to a private hearing before the
Student Judicial Council (SJC) on re
quest.
The atmosphere of the first two
meetings held Jan. 12 and Tuesday
was described as "amicable" as the
student, faculty and administration
committee members met to discuss
seven topics which Lyman cited as de
serving committee action.
Past C-15 sessions have been

plagued by tense feelings among
members, according to sophomore
Andrew Goldenkranz, C-15 chairman,
because they were only called during
crisis situations. However, meetings
this year are expected to be much less
tense and more productive, he said.
The C-15 is the body which drafted
and may amend the university Legisla
tive and Judicial Charter. There are six
students, six faculty members and
three administrators on the committee.
Only the beginning
Goldenkranz said discussions on
whether students should have the
right to a private hearing before the
Student Judicial Council (SJC) on re
quest have just started.
Presently, students may have a pri
vate hearing only upon mutual agree
ment between the student and the
chairman of the SJC.
Most administrative and procedural
concerns were concluded at Tuesday's
meeting and the committee began ad
dressing the seven specific areas listed
by Lyman.
Besides the private hearing ques
tion, Lyman suggested that the C-15
discuss:
—the need for community educa
tion on the Honor Code;
—instructor violations of the Honor
Code;
—the possible option of pleading a
disciplinary case before the Dean of
Student Affairs without first admitting
guilt;
—annual, automatic meetings of the
C-15;
—a re-evaluation of the student
member selection process for the SJC;
and
—more student input into the selec
tion of the Committee on Honor Code
Violations chairperson.
Lyman also asked that apparent
"ambiguities" in the charter regarding
student rights to public or private dis
position of disciplinary cases be dis
cussed.
Charter changes
Goldenkranz expressed optimism
that the deliberations of the C-15
would produce some meaningful
changes in the charter. "Everyone has
been trying to work together to try to
make the judicial system the fairest
and most efficient system we can cont
rive," he said.
"We've had some real lively discus
sion. The tone has been amiable," he
added.
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, shared Goldenkranz's view
of the atmosphere, calling it "amica
ble," but said he felt "it's too early to
tell" whether the committee delibera
tions will result in any changes in the
charter.
Presently, the committee is also dis
cussing whether the letter from Lyman
was a directive, limiting the agenda to
those specific items he listed, or
simply a suggestion of items to dis
cuss.
In the meantime, Goldenkranz said
there is plenty of work to be done.
"We've only just begun and there's
alot to do," he said.
"I think it's going to be a very in
teresting series of meetings ahead of
us," Goldenkranz said.
The C-15 will reconvene next week.
