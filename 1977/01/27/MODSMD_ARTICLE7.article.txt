## Opinions Editorial Reinstate Delts 
### 
Delta Tau Delta fraternity has asked the university to reinstate
its on-campus residence privileges, which were canceled for this
year following vandalization of two other fraternities by a Delt
"foot patrol" last May.
Six students — five Delts and one Delt boarder — were con
victed by the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) and penalized.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons tossed the fraternity off
campus for three years, while letting individual members of the
frat live on campus if they wished.
It's been almost a year since that incident. Now is the time for
the Delts to be allowed back on campus — subject to some tight
restrictions.
Specifically, Delta Tau Delta should be required to post a
$1500 penal bond, which would be forfeited if any Delt pledge or
active were convicted by the courts or by the SJC of an offense
against persons or property in the university community.
The university would return $500 at the end of each year
during which no Delt offenses occurred. The fraternity would
remain on probation during the three-year term of the bond.
Should an offense occur during the probationary period, the
Delts would be treated like any other house on probation. Penal
ties could range from mere forfeiture of the bond for a minor
offense, to permanent expulsion of the fraternity for gross viola
tions. At the end of the three-year period, the Delts would be
removed from probation and the remainder of their bond re
turned.
This plan has many advantages. First, it imposes no actual
penalty on the Delts beyond that which they have already suf
fered. If members of the fraternity behaved, the full amount of the
bond would be returned by the end of the probationary period.
The university terminated the Delta Tau Delta residence
privileges because the Delts did not seem to be furthering the
goals of residential education which are applied to every on
campus house. This was the basis of the notion of "collective
responsibility" used against the frat.
The Delts have already punished the individuals who did the
most damage — fining them and expelling them from the frater
nity. Additionally, each member of the "patrol" has posted an
individual bond.
But the university's proper interest in having civilized tenants
would best be served by this requirement of a substantial bond
with clear criteria for forfeiture, not vague bureaucratic
guidelines.
After all, no one wants to be Delt with by bureaucrats.
