# 'Daily' chem story distorts drive goals

McFarland, Zasada

We would like to thank the Daily for
its well-intentioned but inept attempt
to delineate the position of those stu
dents supporting reform of the organic
chemistry series (Daily Jan. 25). Unfor
tunately, the Daily article's half
presentation and occasional misquota
tions were worse than no presentation
at all, and have forced the following
clarification of our position. We shall
try to be as concise as possible:
First, we are not asking that the or
ganic chemistry classes be made easier
(as per the Daily's flippant caption).
Organic chemistry is a difficult and
tedious subject — we all agree on that.
We are simply saying that it is capable
of being taught more effectively than is
being done here.
Second, it is not our intention to dic
tate teaching methods to the Chemis
try Department — that would not only
be fruitless, but entirely presumptu
ous. What we do wish to do is shake up
the complacency and self-satisfaction
of a department whose techniques are
below the quality expected at a univer
sity of Stanford's reputation.
The major complaint is that students
are completing the organic chem
series without learning chemistry. Our
concern is not with the grading sys
tem, which is properly outside our in
fluence.
The primary difficulty lies in the
Chemistry Department's conception of
the organic chem series as little more
than an early selection process for
medical students. Therefore, 1) much
of the professional staff has disdain for
its students and for the course in gen
eral. leading to 2) many indolent in
struction techniques which have little
regard for education, but are intended
merely to generate material for exami
nation, and 3) laboratory courses
which are poorly taught, poorly
examined and unnecessarily high
pressu red.
Our intention is to convince the
Chemistry Department first that there
is almost universal student dissatisfac
tion with the organic chem series, and
second that this dissatisfaction is not
merely the grumbling of overworked
pre-meds, but the considered opinion
of chemistry and non-chemistry
majors alike that the series can and
should be reformed.
At this writing we have over 250
signatures to that effect, and expect to
easily double that number

It is our further hope that we will not
be forced to publicly list either student
grievances or suggested reforms at this
time — as we believe the resultant pub
lic debate would be entirely unproduc
tive. Rather, we wish the Chemistry
Department to work with a yet-to-be
defined student committee and the
university itself to both list the prob
lems and come up with reforms. Our
petition is to this effect, and no more.
In summary, we believe that the or
ganic chemistry series as now taught
incorporates real blockades to effec
tive education which are not inherent
to the subject of chemistry itself; and
which can be remedied by a serious
cooperative effort between students
and faculty.

time — as we believe the resultant pub
lic debate would be entirely unproduc
tive. Rather, we wish the Chemistry
Department to work with a yet-to-be
defined student committee and the
university itself to both list the prob
lems and come up with reforms. Our
petition is to this effect, and no more.
In summary, we believe that the or
ganic chemistry series as now taught
incorporates real blockades to effec
tive education which are not inherent
to the subject of chemistry itself; and
which can be remedied by a serious
cooperative effort between students
and faculty.

We would like to thank the Daily for
its well-intentioned but inept attempt
to delineate the position of those stu
dents supporting reform of the organic
chemistry series (Daily Jan. 25). Unfor
tunately, the Daily article's half
presentation and occasional misquota
tions were worse than no presentation
at all, and have forced the following
clarification of our position. We shall
try to be as concise as possible:
First, we are not asking that the or
ganic chemistry classes be made easier
(as per the Daily's flippant caption).
Organic chemistry is a difficult and
tedious subject — we all agree on that.
We are simply saying that it is capable
of being taught more effectively than is
being done here.
Second, it is not our intention to dic
tate teaching methods to the Chemis
try Department — that would not only
be fruitless, but entirely presumptu
ous. What we do wish to do is shake up
the complacency and self-satisfaction
of a department whose techniques are
below the quality expected at a univer
sity of Stanford's reputation.
The major complaint is that students
are completing the organic chem
series without learning chemistry. Our
concern is not with the grading sys
tem, which is properly outside our in
fluence.
The primary difficulty lies in the
Chemistry Department's conception of
the organic chem series as little more
than an early selection process for
medical students. Therefore, 1) much
of the professional staff has disdain for
its students and for the course in gen
eral. leading to 2) many indolent in
struction techniques which have little
regard for education, but are intended
merely to generate material for exami
nation, and 3) laboratory courses
which are poorly taught, poorly
examined and unnecessarily high
pressu red.
Our intention is to convince the
Chemistry Department first that there
is almost universal student dissatisfac
tion with the organic chem series, and
second that this dissatisfaction is not
merely the grumbling of overworked
pre-meds, but the considered opinion
of chemistry and non-chemistry
majors alike that the series can and
should be reformed.
At this writing we have over 250
signatures to that effect, and expect to
easily double that number

It is our further hope that we will not
be forced to publicly list either student
grievances or suggested reforms at this
time — as we believe the resultant pub
lic debate would be entirely unproduc
tive. Rather, we wish the Chemistry
Department to work with a yet-to-be
defined student committee and the
university itself to both list the prob
lems and come up with reforms. Our
petition is to this effect, and no more.
In summary, we believe that the or

tive education which are not inherent
