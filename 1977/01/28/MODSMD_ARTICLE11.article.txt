# Letters: chemistry, feminism

Deeply misguided
I am writing in response to the arti
cle {Daily, Jan. 25) concerning the ef
forts of Dave McFarland to alter the
undergraduate curriculum in chemis
try.
McFarland, who the article implied
is a chemistry major, is deeply mis
guided in his interpretation of what
constitutes a desirable education for a

chemistry undergraduate. His objec
tion to "running all over, digging out
reference materials" is absurd.
One of the most important skills a
chemist should develop is the ability
to obtain information firsthand from
the literature, and any undergraduate
program that fails to stress this is in
complete.
He also expressed displeasure at
having to consult a reference book that
was printed in German. Considering
that a large number of articles in the
field are published in foreign lan
guages, especially German, it would
seem that exposure to the process of
translation would be beneficial and
necessary.
But perhaps the most important
point is McFarland's desire to restruc
ture the first quarters of the chemistry
sequence, a desire which has been voi
ced by non-premed chemistry majors
for years.
1 agree wholeheartedly with his
view that the first few quarters should
be devoted to general chemical con
cepts and laboratory techniques, al
lowing for a gentler transition into the
organic lecture and lab courses.
However, it should be noted that the
cause of the deficiency in the current
curriculum in this respect can be
traced to the department's accomoda
tion of the requirements of the large
number of biology majors who need
exposure to organic chemistry before
their first quarter of biochemistry,
which occurs in only the second quar
ter of the biology core.
If the organic sequence were to be
postponed for say a year, the biology
majors would be forced to begin their
core sequence a year later.
It would seem more logical for
McFarland to petition both depart
ments involved to obtain an alteration
in the biology core so that the first
quarter of biochemistry is introduced
at some later point in the sequence (a
change which really wouldn't cause
much disruption), and to obtain an alt
eration in the chemistry sequence as
outlined above.
This arrangement would better suit
the needs of all parties involved.

Chasing windmills
Once again a Stanford feminist has
done the movement a disservice by
chasing windmills. Shannon Blando's
attack on pornography represents
another Daily column highlighting tri
vial issues (remember the criticism of
"Andy Capp"?) at the expense of sub
stantive ones.
To read Blando's diatribe one would
think that women have achieved job

parity, nondiscriminatory credit rat
ings and equal financial status under
law. Blando's article only draws
needed attention away from these and
other important issues of the women's
movement.
If Blando was striking out against
rape, she certainly chose an indirect
route. She completely ignored the hor
ror of a criminal justice system that
treats a raped woman as though she
were the defendent.
Neither does her column attack the
insensitive public attitude that after
being raped a woman is somehow less
valuable as a person.
Further, with respect to other in
stances of physical brutality, she neg
lects the real problem of battered
wives, and in turn focuses on pictures
of made-up models which appeal to a
limited audience.
Finally, nothing has been said about
her article's rather anti-libertarian im
plications for the First Amendment.
As a former staff member in Rep. Bella
Abzug's office, I recall her reason for
not objecting to the House rule pro
hibiting wearing hats in chambers: "1
only fight for the big causes."
While Bella may not have always
acted on this philosophy, it certainly is
appropriate advice for the women's
movement.

Best guarantee
I was interested to read the Daily's
Jan. 26 editorial and its recommenda
tions about future financial arrange
ments for research contracts with
foreign governments.
I agree it would have been preferable
to have secured a letter of credit to back
up the payment schedule, as the con
tract provided. It is also unfortunate
the administrative followup proce
dure failed on this point on this con
tract.
However, I have studied the contract
provisions and continue to believe our
contract with Iran is valid. I believethe
Iranian gove-nment will honor its ob
ligations under it, just as Stanford is
honoring its obligations to complete
and deliver the reports the contract re
quires, to National Iranian Radio and
Television.
A review of others' experiences with
Iran confirms the belief they honor
their obligations.
In the final analysis, what supports
any contract is the good faith and bus
iness reputation of the parties to it: that
is the best and most important guaran
tee.
