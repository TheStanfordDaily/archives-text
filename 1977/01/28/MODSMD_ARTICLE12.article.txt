# Sexism not pornographer's source

While reading the column entitled
"Pornography reveals society's
sexism," (Dnily, Jan. 24) I could not
help but feel pity for Shannon Blando.
Any person who is that out of touch
with the real world is to me a sorry case
indeed.
Although I personally do not carefor
hardcore pronography either, I highly
doubt that its "very essence (is) the
oppression and exploitation of wo
men."
Eor some, pornography is the only
form of sexual release. For others, it is a
source of a "few good laughs" during a
drunken assault on San Francisco's
North Beach. The single largest pur
chasers of pornography are the simply
curious.
Furthermore, there are men. women
and couples who use pornography as a
form of sexual forep lay. After all, if you
are excited by sadomasochism, it is
quite a lot more practical to read a
quick passage or check out a few pic
tures than it is for you or your mate to

bear the marks of whatever kinkiness
would otherwise prevail in the bed
room.
Perverse
There are. of course, those who are
sexually and otherwise perverted.
These are the people who enjoy watch
ing others he hurt, raped or otherwise
sexually mistreated. These are the
people who become rapists or sadistic
housewives (oh. yes. Shannon, there
are female sadists, too).
These people are severely disturbed
and need therapy. But to accuse an en
tire society of being sexist on the basis
of these isolated individuals is, in my
opinion, wholly false.
Moreover, pornography often does
have its social benefits. The statistics
revealing a reduction in the number of
rapes after the introduction of pornog
raphy are undeniable. I for one would
prefer to have crazed males read Hus
tler than to close all vents to a would
be rapist's passion.
To sav that women are totally

excluded from the arena of pornog
raphy is simply false. Some of the most
prolific writers of pornography today
are women — remember Erica Jong
and Xaviera Hollander? Moreover,
there are plenty of females who enjoy
pornography, especially its milder
forms.
Not proof
Just because Viva and PJaygirl ap
peal to homosexuals more than to
women does not prove that society is
sexist. It simply reveals that women do
not view the male form with the same
relish that men view the female form.
Any woman who feels discomfort
from the admiring glance of a male is
missing out on one of society's simpler
joys. I for one appreciate an occasional
glance as do my friends. And the
women I know certainly do not feel
threatened by the wishful gaze of an
admirer. Eye contact expresses ap
preciation of beauty and the desire to
be introduced more often than it asks
for a quick "bang."

Finally, society does often repress
women, but not in the way Shannon
Blando would claim. Society has
labeled women as the sex which can
not enjoy physical passion outside
marriage while no man is considered
abnormal if he has lovers before mar
riage.
The sexism of society does not hold
that "a woman's body is not h»'r own.
but is a commodity to be sold, ogled,
oppressed and exploited." The sexism
of society lies in the fact that women
are expected to bury the natural feelings
of love, emotion and horniness behind
a cold facade while men are allowed to
openly reveal their passion.
The sexism of society is not the dis
comfort a woman feels "when a man
standing next to her, staring intently at
the magazine cover, looks up and
stares at her," but is the fact that she
dare not smile at him or laugh when he
looks up.
