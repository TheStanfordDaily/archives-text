# Daniel Barker discusses how to do it
## Stanford students are Rhodes scholars 
### Lisa Sonne 
"You always think it's some
body you never met, then when
you win the Rhodes, you say
'wow' and start looking around
and realizing that a lot more
people you know should have
applied, especially here at Stan
ford."
Daniel Barker, a Stanford
economics major finishing up
his honors thesis on welfare
poverty, radiates confidence,
humor and humility as he dis
cusses at ease the hows and
whys of becoming Stanford's
43rd Rhodes Scholar. Barker is
one of 32 men and women from
the United States selected this
year for the prestigious scholar
ship to Oxford University in En
gland.
Barker's Rhodes scholarship,
one of 180 annually awarded
(the 32 from the United States
comprise the largest national de
legation), are the vision of Cecil
Rhodes, a British colonial
pioneer and statesman who
wanted, through scholarships to
his alma mater, to better man
kind by aiding the education of
potential leaders. In his will,
Rhodes established the scholar
ships for people with "literary
and scholastic ability and at
tainments; truthfulness, cour
age, devotion to duty, sympathy
for and protection of the weak,
kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; exhibition of physi
cal vigor as shown by fondness
for and success in sports and
moral force of character and in
stincts to lead."
Misconceptions
"1 think there are a lot of mis
conceptions about the Rhodes
scholarship," stressed Barker.
"Athletics are important only
because they want a strong,
well-rounded individual. You
don't have to be a jock. One of the
guys who applied said he climbs
trees for athletic activity, and he
won a Rhodes.
"1 think women will give the
sports criterion an even broader
image away from the stereotype
jock. ' This is the first year the
competition has been open to
females and 12 of the 32 awards
went to women.
Candidates must be unmar
ried and between the ages of 18
and 24 to apply. The scholarship
covers tuition, room and board at
Oxford, provides an ample liv
ing allowance, ?nd is often re
newable after the initial two year
grant. Legal changes in the Un
ited Kingdom in 1976 permitted
the Rhodes Board of Trustees to
open the competition to women,
a development which Barker
feels "most Stanford women
aren't aware of."
Rhodes also specified in his
will that a person must not
merely be a bookworm to qualify
for a scholarship. Barker con
tinued.
"1 think someone would be
kidding themselves to apply if
they had less than a B plus, A
minus average. What they are

looking for is an active, vigorous
individual who's going to use
his experience to be a future
leader," he said.
Policy making
Barker's diverse background
displays those capabilities. Be
fore transferring here as a junior,
he attended Brigham Young
University where he partici
pated in several extra curricular
activities and helped redesign
the University's grading policy
in religion classes. It was in this
process that he "confirmed his
inclination to study policy mak
ing," a pursuit which he will
continue through Oxford's
philosophy and politics courses.
Serving for two years as a
Mormon missionary in Ger
many, Canada, and the United
States strengthened the Salt
Lake City native's religious pre
cepts "which guide my life." It
also helped him appreciate "the
awareness that can only come
from actively participating in a
culture different than one's
own;" something he is now
eager to do in England.
Transferring to Stanford and
"interacting with peers and fa
culty with a different orientation
than my own . . . taught me to
question, and has given me a
drive to learn more and more."
At Stanford, Barker investi
gated the Affirmative Action as a
Research Assistant to Walter
Williams, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution last year
while continuing his economics
major and his youth leadership
role in the local Mormon
Church.
Expansion
He served last summer in the
Stanford in Washington intern
ship program, "an experience I
recommend to anyone for cul
tural as well as political expan
sion." Barker was part of the
New England Congressional
Caucus staff, and also acted as an
activities coordinator for interns
of several universities.
Last fall Barker was busy get
ting together his Rhodes appli
cation with its accompanying
pictures and essay, which
needed to reach the Rhodes State
Committee of Selection by Oct.
31. He was also interviewed by
Stanford's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA) com
posed of faculty, former scholars
and staff. Their evaluative report
was also mailed to the State
Committee.
Candidates can apply either in
their home state or in tbe state in
which they have received at least
two years of college training.
Barker chose to apply in Utah.
After interviewing the applic
ants, a State Committee may
nominate only two candidates to
appear before the District Com
mittee, a district comprising six
or seven states. (California is in
the same district as Hawaii,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Col
orado and New Mexico.) Each of
the eight geographical districts

annually interviews the candi
dates from its states and then
chooses on the spot four final
candidates, making 32 winners.
After the candidates' success
ful election, the Rhodes Scholar
ship authorities in Oxford .seek
places for them in one of Ox
ford's many colleges, some of
which were founded in the 11th
Century.

Barker, who now waits to hear
which Oxford college he'll be at
tending, feels that someone in
terested in applying should
work hard on their applications
so that they can survive the ini
tial screening process to the
State interviews. After that,
Barker said most of the selective
process is "chemistry." Because
the "candidates screened at that

level are all really good, the de
cisions are fairly arbitrary."
Barker shook his head, re
membering the challenges of the
Rhodes interviewers (all previ
ous Rhodes scholars). He confes
ses that for him the interview
was almost the most relaxed part
of the process after all the ten
sion and waiting (and flying to
Utah in mid-December with a

Human Bio. final in his suitcase,
yet to be taken.)
Mr. Barker, please
He was introduced to his in
terview panel as "Mr. Barker,
who should be able to answer
any questions you may have on
Law, Economics or Social Pol
icy." At the State level he was
asked by one sharp questioner
how he resolved his religious be
liefs with the views of Marxist
Professor John Curley, who
wrote one of Barker's recom
mendations.
"In my case the odds paid off."
he grinned. "I remember last
spring when I went in to talk to
Jeanette Phillips (Stanford's
Rhodes application adviser and
the overseas opportunities ad
viser) at Bechtel International
Center. She looked over my re
cord and told me I probably had
as good a chance as anybody."
Now Barker is working with
Philips to better publicize the
Rhodes scholarship program,
and other overseas study oppor
tunities. Like Barker, the youth
ful and enthusiastic Philips feels
"that a lot of Stanford students
could qualify and it doesn't ever
occur to them."
Bike riders
Philips urges people not to
worry about the exact Rhodes
criterian, saying "they don't re
ally consider all that." She en
courages those who have "excel
lent academic records, outside
activities, and a strong interest
in Great Britain to apply. If you
ride your bike around campus
that's enough athletics," she
adds.
Stirring capaccino in the Cof
fee House, Philips discussed the
program, initiated by Barker, to
be held Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at
Bechtel for all students in
terested in studying in Great Bri
tain: "Peter Stansky (Stanford's
Rhodes Chairman this year) will
be there, as will several former
Rhodes and Marshall scholars.
We'll also be discussing several
non-scholarship alternatives
such as Stanford-in-Britain at
Cliveden, and the process of ap

plying to British universities as
an American student."
Marshall scholarships are
another generous, prestigious
two year scholarship. They are
applicable to any British univer
sity. and are open to students
under 26, regardless of sex or
marital status. The program was
established in 1953 by the gov
ernment of the United Kingdom
as an expression of gratitude for
the European Recovery Program
instituted by General Marshall
in 1947.
Strict criterion
Barker feels that the Marshall
scholarship, which he unsuc
cessfully applied for. is based
"more strictly on your academic
record than the Rhodes."
Philips points out that the
Marshall is not as strict as the
Rhodes in geographic competi
tion. The Marshall's 30 scholars
are composed of four students
from each of five regions, and 10
students chosen at large.
"Theoretically," says Philips,
"all 10 of the 'at large' could be
from California."
The winners of the Marshall
awards have not yet been an
nounced, but Philips is hopeful
that Stanford will be rep
resented.
Begin now
Philips urges people who are
thinking about applying for one
of these awards to come to her
office, on the second floor of
Bechtel, in the near future. "The
October deadlines (Oct. 22 for
Marshall, Oct. 31 for Rhodes)
come at a time when students are
still trying to settle their fall
quarter. I'll be glad to give advise
and help with essays if people
come in early . . . now is the time
to start." she continued, "and
yes, I will tell someone if they
shouldn't bother applying.
"Hopefully our program Feb.
1 will increase student aware
ness and involvement. Harvard,
Yale and Princeton consistently
get more Rhodes awards than we
do, but then they have three to
four times as many students ap
plying."

kind by aiding the education of
potential leaders. In his will,
Rhodes established the scholar
ships for people with "literary
and scholastic ability and at
tainments; truthfulness, cour
age, devotion to duty, sympathy
for and protection of the weak,
kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; exhibition of physi
cal vigor as shown by fondness
for and success in sports and
moral force of character and in
stincts to lead."
Misconceptions
"1 think there are a lot of mis
conceptions about the Rhodes
scholarship," stressed Barker.
"Athletics are important only
because they want a strong,
well-rounded individual. You
don't have to be a jock. One of the
guys who applied said he climbs
trees for athletic activity, and he
won a Rhodes.
"1 think women will give the
sports criterion an even broader
image away from the stereotype
jock. ' This is the first year the
competition has been open to
females and 12 of the 32 awards
went to women.
Candidates must be unmar
ried and between the ages of 18
and 24 to apply. The scholarship
covers tuition, room and board at
Oxford, provides an ample liv
ing allowance, ?nd is often re
newable after the initial two year
grant. Legal changes in the Un
ited Kingdom in 1976 permitted
the Rhodes Board of Trustees to
open the competition to women,
a development which Barker
feels "most Stanford women
aren't aware of."
Rhodes also specified in his
will that a person must not
merely be a bookworm to qualify
for a scholarship. Barker con
tinued.
"1 think someone would be
kidding themselves to apply if
they had less than a B plus, A
minus average. What they are

looking for is an active, vigorous
individual who's going to use
his experience to be a future
leader," he said.
Policy making
Barker's diverse background
displays those capabilities. Be
fore transferring here as a junior,
he attended Brigham Young
University where he partici
pated in several extra curricular
activities and helped redesign
the University's grading policy
in religion classes. It was in this
process that he "confirmed his
inclination to study policy mak
ing," a pursuit which he will
continue through Oxford's
philosophy and politics courses.
Serving for two years as a
Mormon missionary in Ger
many, Canada, and the United
States strengthened the Salt
Lake City native's religious pre
cepts "which guide my life." It
also helped him appreciate "the
awareness that can only come
from actively participating in a
culture different than one's
own;" something he is now
eager to do in England.
Transferring to Stanford and
"interacting with peers and fa
culty with a different orientation
than my own . . . taught me to
question, and has given me a
drive to learn more and more."
At Stanford, Barker investi
gated the Affirmative Action as a
Research Assistant to Walter
Williams, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution last year
while continuing his economics
major and his youth leadership
role in the local Mormon
Church.
Expansion
He served last summer in the
Stanford in Washington intern
ship program, "an experience I
recommend to anyone for cul
tural as well as political expan
sion." Barker was part of the
New England Congressional
Caucus staff, and also acted as an
activities coordinator for interns
of several universities.
Last fall Barker was busy get
ting together his Rhodes appli
cation with its accompanying
pictures and essay, which
needed to reach the Rhodes State
Committee of Selection by Oct.
31. He was also interviewed by
Stanford's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA) com
posed of faculty, former scholars
and staff. Their evaluative report
was also mailed to the State
Committee.
Candidates can apply either in
their home state or in tbe state in
which they have received at least
two years of college training.
Barker chose to apply in Utah.
After interviewing the applic
ants, a State Committee may
nominate only two candidates to
appear before the District Com
mittee, a district comprising six
or seven states. (California is in
the same district as Hawaii,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Col
orado and New Mexico.) Each of
the eight geographical districts

annually interviews the candi
dates from its states and then
chooses on the spot four final
candidates, making 32 winners.
After the candidates' success
ful election, the Rhodes Scholar
ship authorities in Oxford .seek
places for them in one of Ox
ford's many colleges, some of
which were founded in the 11th
Century.

Barker, who now waits to hear
which Oxford college he'll be at
tending, feels that someone in
terested in applying should
work hard on their applications
so that they can survive the ini
tial screening process to the
State interviews. After that,
Barker said most of the selective
process is "chemistry." Because
the "candidates screened at that

level are all really good, the de
cisions are fairly arbitrary."
Barker shook his head, re
membering the challenges of the
Rhodes interviewers (all previ
ous Rhodes scholars). He confes
ses that for him the interview
was almost the most relaxed part
of the process after all the ten
sion and waiting (and flying to
Utah in mid-December with a

Human Bio. final in his suitcase,
yet to be taken.)
Mr. Barker, please
He was introduced to his in
terview panel as "Mr. Barker,
who should be able to answer
any questions you may have on
Law, Economics or Social Pol
icy." At the State level he was
asked by one sharp questioner
how he resolved his religious be
liefs with the views of Marxist
Professor John Curley, who
wrote one of Barker's recom
mendations.
"In my case the odds paid off."
he grinned. "I remember last
spring when I went in to talk to
Jeanette Phillips (Stanford's
Rhodes application adviser and
the overseas opportunities ad
viser) at Bechtel International
Center. She looked over my re
cord and told me I probably had
as good a chance as anybody."
Now Barker is working with
Philips to better publicize the
Rhodes scholarship program,
and other overseas study oppor
tunities. Like Barker, the youth
ful and enthusiastic Philips feels
"that a lot of Stanford students
could qualify and it doesn't ever
occur to them."
Bike riders
Philips urges people not to
worry about the exact Rhodes
criterian, saying "they don't re
ally consider all that." She en
courages those who have "excel
lent academic records, outside
activities, and a strong interest
in Great Britain to apply. If you
ride your bike around campus
that's enough athletics," she
adds.
Stirring capaccino in the Cof
fee House, Philips discussed the
program, initiated by Barker, to
be held Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at
Bechtel for all students in
terested in studying in Great Bri
tain: "Peter Stansky (Stanford's
Rhodes Chairman this year) will
be there, as will several former
Rhodes and Marshall scholars.
We'll also be discussing several
non-scholarship alternatives
such as Stanford-in-Britain at
Cliveden, and the process of ap

plying to British universities as
an American student."
Marshall scholarships are
another generous, prestigious
two year scholarship. They are
applicable to any British univer
sity. and are open to students
under 26, regardless of sex or
marital status. The program was
established in 1953 by the gov
ernment of the United Kingdom
as an expression of gratitude for
the European Recovery Program
instituted by General Marshall
in 1947.
Strict criterion
Barker feels that the Marshall
scholarship, which he unsuc
cessfully applied for. is based
"more strictly on your academic
record than the Rhodes."
Philips points out that the
Marshall is not as strict as the
Rhodes in geographic competi
tion. The Marshall's 30 scholars
are composed of four students
from each of five regions, and 10
students chosen at large.
"Theoretically," says Philips,
"all 10 of the 'at large' could be
from California."
The winners of the Marshall
awards have not yet been an
nounced, but Philips is hopeful
that Stanford will be rep
resented.
Begin now
Philips urges people who are
thinking about applying for one
of these awards to come to her
office, on the second floor of
Bechtel, in the near future. "The
October deadlines (Oct. 22 for
Marshall, Oct. 31 for Rhodes)
come at a time when students are
still trying to settle their fall
quarter. I'll be glad to give advise
and help with essays if people
come in early . . . now is the time
to start." she continued, "and
yes, I will tell someone if they
shouldn't bother applying.
"Hopefully our program Feb.
1 will increase student aware
ness and involvement. Harvard,
Yale and Princeton consistently
get more Rhodes awards than we
do, but then they have three to
four times as many students ap
plying."

"You always think it's some
body you never met, then when
you win the Rhodes, you say
'wow' and start looking around
and realizing that a lot more
people you know should have
applied, especially here at Stan

Daniel Barker, a Stanford

poverty, radiates confidence,

43rd Rhodes Scholar. Barker is

(the 32 from the United States

went to women.
Candidates must be unmar
ried and between the ages of 18
and 24 to apply. The scholarship
covers tuition, room and board at
Oxford, provides an ample liv
ing allowance, ?nd is often re
newable after the initial two year
grant. Legal changes in the Un
ited Kingdom in 1976 permitted
the Rhodes Board of Trustees to
open the competition to women,
a development which Barker
feels "most Stanford women
aren't aware of."
Rhodes also specified in his
will that a person must not
merely be a bookworm to qualify
for a scholarship. Barker con
tinued.
"1 think someone would be
kidding themselves to apply if
they had less than a B plus, A
minus average. What they are

looking for is an active, vigorous
individual who's going to use
his experience to be a future
leader," he said.
Policy making
Barker's diverse background
displays those capabilities. Be
fore transferring here as a junior,
he attended Brigham Young
University where he partici
pated in several extra curricular
activities and helped redesign
the University's grading policy
in religion classes. It was in this
process that he "confirmed his
inclination to study policy mak
ing," a pursuit which he will
continue through Oxford's
philosophy and politics courses.
Serving for two years as a
Mormon missionary in Ger
many, Canada, and the United
States strengthened the Salt
Lake City native's religious pre
cepts "which guide my life." It
also helped him appreciate "the
awareness that can only come
from actively participating in a
culture different than one's
own;" something he is now
eager to do in England.
Transferring to Stanford and
"interacting with peers and fa
culty with a different orientation
than my own . . . taught me to
question, and has given me a
drive to learn more and more."
At Stanford, Barker investi
gated the Affirmative Action as a
Research Assistant to Walter
Williams, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution last year
while continuing his economics
major and his youth leadership
role in the local Mormon
Church.
Expansion
He served last summer in the
Stanford in Washington intern
ship program, "an experience I
recommend to anyone for cul
tural as well as political expan
sion." Barker was part of the
New England Congressional
Caucus staff, and also acted as an
activities coordinator for interns
of several universities.
Last fall Barker was busy get
ting together his Rhodes appli
cation with its accompanying
pictures and essay, which
needed to reach the Rhodes State
Committee of Selection by Oct.
31. He was also interviewed by
Stanford's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA) com
posed of faculty, former scholars
and staff. Their evaluative report
was also mailed to the State
Committee.
Candidates can apply either in
their home state or in tbe state in
which they have received at least
two years of college training.
Barker chose to apply in Utah.
After interviewing the applic
ants, a State Committee may
nominate only two candidates to
appear before the District Com
mittee, a district comprising six
or seven states. (California is in
the same district as Hawaii,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Col
orado and New Mexico.) Each of
the eight geographical districts

annually interviews the candi
dates from its states and then
chooses on the spot four final
candidates, making 32 winners.
After the candidates' success
ful election, the Rhodes Scholar
ship authorities in Oxford .seek
places for them in one of Ox
ford's many colleges, some of
which were founded in the 11th
Century.

Barker, who now waits to hear
which Oxford college he'll be at
tending, feels that someone in
terested in applying should
work hard on their applications
so that they can survive the ini
tial screening process to the
State interviews. After that,
Barker said most of the selective
process is "chemistry." Because
the "candidates screened at that

level are all really good, the de
cisions are fairly arbitrary."
Barker shook his head, re
membering the challenges of the
Rhodes interviewers (all previ
ous Rhodes scholars). He confes
ses that for him the interview
was almost the most relaxed part
of the process after all the ten
sion and waiting (and flying to
Utah in mid-December with a

Human Bio. final in his suitcase,
yet to be taken.)
Mr. Barker, please
He was introduced to his in
terview panel as "Mr. Barker,
who should be able to answer
any questions you may have on
Law, Economics or Social Pol
icy." At the State level he was
asked by one sharp questioner
how he resolved his religious be
liefs with the views of Marxist
Professor John Curley, who
wrote one of Barker's recom
mendations.
"In my case the odds paid off."
he grinned. "I remember last
spring when I went in to talk to
Jeanette Phillips (Stanford's
Rhodes application adviser and
the overseas opportunities ad
viser) at Bechtel International
Center. She looked over my re
cord and told me I probably had
as good a chance as anybody."
Now Barker is working with
Philips to better publicize the
Rhodes scholarship program,
and other overseas study oppor
tunities. Like Barker, the youth
ful and enthusiastic Philips feels
"that a lot of Stanford students
could qualify and it doesn't ever
occur to them."
Bike riders
Philips urges people not to
worry about the exact Rhodes
criterian, saying "they don't re
ally consider all that." She en
courages those who have "excel
lent academic records, outside
activities, and a strong interest
in Great Britain to apply. If you
ride your bike around campus
that's enough athletics," she
adds.
Stirring capaccino in the Cof
fee House, Philips discussed the
program, initiated by Barker, to
be held Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at
Bechtel for all students in
terested in studying in Great Bri
tain: "Peter Stansky (Stanford's
Rhodes Chairman this year) will
be there, as will several former
Rhodes and Marshall scholars.
We'll also be discussing several
non-scholarship alternatives
such as Stanford-in-Britain at
Cliveden, and the process of ap

plying to British universities as
an American student."
Marshall scholarships are
another generous, prestigious
two year scholarship. They are
applicable to any British univer
sity. and are open to students
under 26, regardless of sex or
marital status. The program was
established in 1953 by the gov
ernment of the United Kingdom
as an expression of gratitude for
the European Recovery Program
instituted by General Marshall
in 1947.
Strict criterion
Barker feels that the Marshall
scholarship, which he unsuc
cessfully applied for. is based
"more strictly on your academic
record than the Rhodes."
Philips points out that the
Marshall is not as strict as the
Rhodes in geographic competi
tion. The Marshall's 30 scholars
are composed of four students
from each of five regions, and 10
students chosen at large.
"Theoretically," says Philips,
"all 10 of the 'at large' could be
from California."
The winners of the Marshall
awards have not yet been an
nounced, but Philips is hopeful
that Stanford will be rep
resented.
Begin now
Philips urges people who are
thinking about applying for one
of these awards to come to her
office, on the second floor of
Bechtel, in the near future. "The
October deadlines (Oct. 22 for
Marshall, Oct. 31 for Rhodes)
come at a time when students are
still trying to settle their fall
quarter. I'll be glad to give advise
and help with essays if people
come in early . . . now is the time
to start." she continued, "and
yes, I will tell someone if they
shouldn't bother applying.
"Hopefully our program Feb.
1 will increase student aware
ness and involvement. Harvard,
Yale and Princeton consistently
get more Rhodes awards than we
do, but then they have three to
four times as many students ap
plying."

"You always think it's some
body you never met, then when
you win the Rhodes, you say
'wow' and start looking around
and realizing that a lot more
people you know should have
applied, especially here at Stan
ford."
Daniel Barker, a Stanford
economics major finishing up
his honors thesis on welfare
poverty, radiates confidence,
humor and humility as he dis
cusses at ease the hows and
whys of becoming Stanford's
43rd Rhodes Scholar. Barker is
one of 32 men and women from
the United States selected this
year for the prestigious scholar
ship to Oxford University in En
gland.
Barker's Rhodes scholarship,
one of 180 annually awarded
(the 32 from the United States
comprise the largest national de
legation), are the vision of Cecil
Rhodes, a British colonial
pioneer and statesman who
wanted, through scholarships to
his alma mater, to better man
kind by aiding the education of
potential leaders. In his will,
Rhodes established the scholar
ships for people with "literary
and scholastic ability and at
tainments; truthfulness, cour
age, devotion to duty, sympathy
for and protection of the weak,
kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; exhibition of physi
cal vigor as shown by fondness
for and success in sports and
moral force of character and in
stincts to lead."
Misconceptions
"1 think there are a lot of mis
conceptions about the Rhodes
scholarship," stressed Barker.
"Athletics are important only
because they want a strong,
well-rounded individual. You
don't have to be a jock. One of the
guys who applied said he climbs
trees for athletic activity, and he
won a Rhodes.
"1 think women will give the
sports criterion an even broader
image away from the stereotype
jock. ' This is the first year the

fore transferring here as a junior,
he attended Brigham Young
University where he partici
pated in several extra curricular
activities and helped redesign
the University's grading policy
in religion classes. It was in this
process that he "confirmed his
inclination to study policy mak
ing," a pursuit which he will
continue through Oxford's
philosophy and politics courses.
Serving for two years as a
Mormon missionary in Ger
many, Canada, and the United
States strengthened the Salt
Lake City native's religious pre
cepts "which guide my life." It
also helped him appreciate "the
awareness that can only come
from actively participating in a
culture different than one's
own;" something he is now
eager to do in England.
Transferring to Stanford and
"interacting with peers and fa
culty with a different orientation
than my own . . . taught me to
question, and has given me a
drive to learn more and more."
At Stanford, Barker investi
gated the Affirmative Action as a
Research Assistant to Walter
Williams, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution last year
while continuing his economics
major and his youth leadership
role in the local Mormon
Church.
Expansion
He served last summer in the
Stanford in Washington intern
ship program, "an experience I
recommend to anyone for cul
tural as well as political expan
sion." Barker was part of the
New England Congressional
Caucus staff, and also acted as an
activities coordinator for interns
of several universities.
Last fall Barker was busy get
ting together his Rhodes appli
cation with its accompanying
pictures and essay, which
needed to reach the Rhodes State
Committee of Selection by Oct.
31. He was also interviewed by
Stanford's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA) com
posed of faculty, former scholars
and staff. Their evaluative report
was also mailed to the State
Committee.
Candidates can apply either in
their home state or in tbe state in
which they have received at least
two years of college training.
Barker chose to apply in Utah.
After interviewing the applic
ants, a State Committee may
nominate only two candidates to
appear before the District Com
mittee, a district comprising six
or seven states. (California is in
the same district as Hawaii,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Col
orado and New Mexico.) Each of
the eight geographical districts

annually interviews the candi
dates from its states and then
chooses on the spot four final
candidates, making 32 winners.
After the candidates' success
ful election, the Rhodes Scholar
ship authorities in Oxford .seek
places for them in one of Ox
ford's many colleges, some of
which were founded in the 11th
Century.

Barker, who now waits to hear
which Oxford college he'll be at
tending, feels that someone in
terested in applying should
work hard on their applications
so that they can survive the ini
tial screening process to the
State interviews. After that,
Barker said most of the selective
process is "chemistry." Because
the "candidates screened at that

level are all really good, the de
cisions are fairly arbitrary."
Barker shook his head, re
membering the challenges of the
Rhodes interviewers (all previ
ous Rhodes scholars). He confes
ses that for him the interview
was almost the most relaxed part
of the process after all the ten
sion and waiting (and flying to
Utah in mid-December with a

Human Bio. final in his suitcase,
yet to be taken.)
Mr. Barker, please
He was introduced to his in
terview panel as "Mr. Barker,
who should be able to answer
any questions you may have on
Law, Economics or Social Pol
icy." At the State level he was
asked by one sharp questioner
how he resolved his religious be
liefs with the views of Marxist
Professor John Curley, who
wrote one of Barker's recom
mendations.
"In my case the odds paid off."
he grinned. "I remember last
spring when I went in to talk to
Jeanette Phillips (Stanford's
Rhodes application adviser and
the overseas opportunities ad
viser) at Bechtel International
Center. She looked over my re
cord and told me I probably had
as good a chance as anybody."
Now Barker is working with
Philips to better publicize the
Rhodes scholarship program,
and other overseas study oppor
tunities. Like Barker, the youth
ful and enthusiastic Philips feels
"that a lot of Stanford students
could qualify and it doesn't ever
occur to them."
Bike riders
Philips urges people not to
worry about the exact Rhodes
criterian, saying "they don't re
ally consider all that." She en
courages those who have "excel
lent academic records, outside
activities, and a strong interest
in Great Britain to apply. If you
ride your bike around campus
that's enough athletics," she
adds.
Stirring capaccino in the Cof
fee House, Philips discussed the
program, initiated by Barker, to
be held Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at
Bechtel for all students in
terested in studying in Great Bri
tain: "Peter Stansky (Stanford's
Rhodes Chairman this year) will
be there, as will several former
Rhodes and Marshall scholars.
We'll also be discussing several
non-scholarship alternatives
such as Stanford-in-Britain at
Cliveden, and the process of ap

plying to British universities as
an American student."
Marshall scholarships are
another generous, prestigious
two year scholarship. They are
applicable to any British univer
sity. and are open to students
under 26, regardless of sex or
marital status. The program was
established in 1953 by the gov
ernment of the United Kingdom
as an expression of gratitude for
the European Recovery Program
instituted by General Marshall
in 1947.
Strict criterion
Barker feels that the Marshall
scholarship, which he unsuc
cessfully applied for. is based
"more strictly on your academic
record than the Rhodes."
Philips points out that the
Marshall is not as strict as the
Rhodes in geographic competi
tion. The Marshall's 30 scholars
are composed of four students
from each of five regions, and 10
students chosen at large.
"Theoretically," says Philips,
"all 10 of the 'at large' could be
from California."
The winners of the Marshall
awards have not yet been an
nounced, but Philips is hopeful
that Stanford will be rep
resented.
Begin now
Philips urges people who are
thinking about applying for one
of these awards to come to her
office, on the second floor of
Bechtel, in the near future. "The
October deadlines (Oct. 22 for
Marshall, Oct. 31 for Rhodes)
come at a time when students are
still trying to settle their fall
quarter. I'll be glad to give advise
and help with essays if people
come in early . . . now is the time
to start." she continued, "and
yes, I will tell someone if they
shouldn't bother applying.
"Hopefully our program Feb.
1 will increase student aware
ness and involvement. Harvard,
Yale and Princeton consistently
get more Rhodes awards than we
do, but then they have three to
four times as many students ap
plying."

"You always think it's some
body you never met, then when
you win the Rhodes, you say
'wow' and start looking around
and realizing that a lot more
people you know should have
applied, especially here at Stan
ford."
Daniel Barker, a Stanford
economics major finishing up
his honors thesis on welfare
poverty, radiates confidence,
humor and humility as he dis
cusses at ease the hows and
whys of becoming Stanford's
43rd Rhodes Scholar. Barker is
one of 32 men and women from
the United States selected this
year for the prestigious scholar
ship to Oxford University in En
gland.
Barker's Rhodes scholarship,
one of 180 annually awarded
(the 32 from the United States
comprise the largest national de
legation), are the vision of Cecil
Rhodes, a British colonial
pioneer and statesman who
wanted, through scholarships to
his alma mater, to better man
kind by aiding the education of
potential leaders. In his will,
Rhodes established the scholar
ships for people with "literary
and scholastic ability and at
tainments; truthfulness, cour
age, devotion to duty, sympathy
for and protection of the weak,
kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; exhibition of physi
cal vigor as shown by fondness
for and success in sports and
moral force of character and in
stincts to lead."
Misconceptions
"1 think there are a lot of mis
conceptions about the Rhodes
scholarship," stressed Barker.
"Athletics are important only
because they want a strong,
well-rounded individual. You
don't have to be a jock. One of the
guys who applied said he climbs
trees for athletic activity, and he
won a Rhodes.
"1 think women will give the
sports criterion an even broader
image away from the stereotype
jock. ' This is the first year the
competition has been open to
females and 12 of the 32 awards
went to women.
Candidates must be unmar
ried and between the ages of 18
and 24 to apply. The scholarship
covers tuition, room and board at
Oxford, provides an ample liv
ing allowance, ?nd is often re
newable after the initial two year
grant. Legal changes in the Un
ited Kingdom in 1976 permitted
the Rhodes Board of Trustees to
open the competition to women,
a development which Barker
feels "most Stanford women
aren't aware of."
Rhodes also specified in his
will that a person must not
merely be a bookworm to qualify
for a scholarship. Barker con
tinued.
"1 think someone would be
kidding themselves to apply if
they had less than a B plus, A
minus average. What they are

looking for is an active, vigorous
individual who's going to use
his experience to be a future
leader," he said.

Research Assistant to Walter
Williams, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution last year
while continuing his economics
major and his youth leadership
role in the local Mormon
Church.
Expansion
He served last summer in the
Stanford in Washington intern
ship program, "an experience I
recommend to anyone for cul
tural as well as political expan
sion." Barker was part of the
New England Congressional
Caucus staff, and also acted as an
activities coordinator for interns
of several universities.
Last fall Barker was busy get
ting together his Rhodes appli
cation with its accompanying
pictures and essay, which
needed to reach the Rhodes State
Committee of Selection by Oct.
31. He was also interviewed by
Stanford's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA) com
posed of faculty, former scholars
and staff. Their evaluative report
was also mailed to the State
Committee.
Candidates can apply either in
their home state or in tbe state in
which they have received at least
two years of college training.
Barker chose to apply in Utah.
After interviewing the applic
ants, a State Committee may
nominate only two candidates to
appear before the District Com
mittee, a district comprising six
or seven states. (California is in
the same district as Hawaii,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Col
orado and New Mexico.) Each of
the eight geographical districts

annually interviews the candi
dates from its states and then
chooses on the spot four final
candidates, making 32 winners.
After the candidates' success
ful election, the Rhodes Scholar
ship authorities in Oxford .seek
places for them in one of Ox
ford's many colleges, some of
which were founded in the 11th
Century.

Barker, who now waits to hear
which Oxford college he'll be at
tending, feels that someone in
terested in applying should
work hard on their applications
so that they can survive the ini
tial screening process to the
State interviews. After that,
Barker said most of the selective
process is "chemistry." Because
the "candidates screened at that

level are all really good, the de
cisions are fairly arbitrary."
Barker shook his head, re
membering the challenges of the
Rhodes interviewers (all previ
ous Rhodes scholars). He confes
ses that for him the interview
was almost the most relaxed part
of the process after all the ten
sion and waiting (and flying to
Utah in mid-December with a

Human Bio. final in his suitcase,
yet to be taken.)
Mr. Barker, please
He was introduced to his in
terview panel as "Mr. Barker,
who should be able to answer
any questions you may have on
Law, Economics or Social Pol
icy." At the State level he was
asked by one sharp questioner
how he resolved his religious be
liefs with the views of Marxist
Professor John Curley, who
wrote one of Barker's recom
mendations.
"In my case the odds paid off."
he grinned. "I remember last
spring when I went in to talk to
Jeanette Phillips (Stanford's
Rhodes application adviser and
the overseas opportunities ad
viser) at Bechtel International
Center. She looked over my re
cord and told me I probably had
as good a chance as anybody."
Now Barker is working with
Philips to better publicize the
Rhodes scholarship program,
and other overseas study oppor
tunities. Like Barker, the youth
ful and enthusiastic Philips feels
"that a lot of Stanford students
could qualify and it doesn't ever
occur to them."
Bike riders
Philips urges people not to
worry about the exact Rhodes
criterian, saying "they don't re
ally consider all that." She en
courages those who have "excel
lent academic records, outside
activities, and a strong interest
in Great Britain to apply. If you
ride your bike around campus
that's enough athletics," she
adds.
Stirring capaccino in the Cof
fee House, Philips discussed the
program, initiated by Barker, to
be held Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at
Bechtel for all students in
terested in studying in Great Bri
tain: "Peter Stansky (Stanford's
Rhodes Chairman this year) will
be there, as will several former
Rhodes and Marshall scholars.
We'll also be discussing several
non-scholarship alternatives
such as Stanford-in-Britain at
Cliveden, and the process of ap

plying to British universities as
an American student."
Marshall scholarships are
another generous, prestigious
two year scholarship. They are
applicable to any British univer
sity. and are open to students
under 26, regardless of sex or
marital status. The program was
established in 1953 by the gov
ernment of the United Kingdom
as an expression of gratitude for
the European Recovery Program
instituted by General Marshall
in 1947.
Strict criterion
Barker feels that the Marshall
scholarship, which he unsuc
cessfully applied for. is based
"more strictly on your academic
record than the Rhodes."
Philips points out that the
Marshall is not as strict as the
Rhodes in geographic competi
tion. The Marshall's 30 scholars
are composed of four students
from each of five regions, and 10
students chosen at large.
"Theoretically," says Philips,
"all 10 of the 'at large' could be
from California."
The winners of the Marshall
awards have not yet been an
nounced, but Philips is hopeful
that Stanford will be rep
resented.
Begin now
Philips urges people who are
thinking about applying for one
of these awards to come to her
office, on the second floor of
Bechtel, in the near future. "The
October deadlines (Oct. 22 for
Marshall, Oct. 31 for Rhodes)
come at a time when students are
still trying to settle their fall
quarter. I'll be glad to give advise
and help with essays if people
come in early . . . now is the time
to start." she continued, "and
yes, I will tell someone if they
shouldn't bother applying.
"Hopefully our program Feb.
1 will increase student aware
ness and involvement. Harvard,
Yale and Princeton consistently
get more Rhodes awards than we
do, but then they have three to
four times as many students ap
plying."

"You always think it's some
body you never met, then when
you win the Rhodes, you say
'wow' and start looking around
and realizing that a lot more
people you know should have
applied, especially here at Stan
ford."
Daniel Barker, a Stanford
economics major finishing up
his honors thesis on welfare
poverty, radiates confidence,
humor and humility as he dis
cusses at ease the hows and
whys of becoming Stanford's
43rd Rhodes Scholar. Barker is
one of 32 men and women from
the United States selected this
year for the prestigious scholar
ship to Oxford University in En
gland.
Barker's Rhodes scholarship,
one of 180 annually awarded
(the 32 from the United States
comprise the largest national de
legation), are the vision of Cecil
Rhodes, a British colonial
pioneer and statesman who
wanted, through scholarships to
his alma mater, to better man
kind by aiding the education of
potential leaders. In his will,
Rhodes established the scholar
ships for people with "literary
and scholastic ability and at
tainments; truthfulness, cour
age, devotion to duty, sympathy
for and protection of the weak,
kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; exhibition of physi
cal vigor as shown by fondness
for and success in sports and
moral force of character and in
stincts to lead."
Misconceptions
"1 think there are a lot of mis
conceptions about the Rhodes
scholarship," stressed Barker.
"Athletics are important only
because they want a strong,
well-rounded individual. You
don't have to be a jock. One of the
guys who applied said he climbs
trees for athletic activity, and he
won a Rhodes.
"1 think women will give the
sports criterion an even broader
image away from the stereotype
jock. ' This is the first year the
competition has been open to
females and 12 of the 32 awards
went to women.
Candidates must be unmar
ried and between the ages of 18
and 24 to apply. The scholarship
covers tuition, room and board at
Oxford, provides an ample liv
ing allowance, ?nd is often re
newable after the initial two year
grant. Legal changes in the Un
ited Kingdom in 1976 permitted
the Rhodes Board of Trustees to
open the competition to women,
a development which Barker
feels "most Stanford women
aren't aware of."
Rhodes also specified in his
will that a person must not
merely be a bookworm to qualify
for a scholarship. Barker con
tinued.
"1 think someone would be
kidding themselves to apply if
they had less than a B plus, A
minus average. What they are

looking for is an active, vigorous
individual who's going to use
his experience to be a future
leader," he said.
Policy making
Barker's diverse background
displays those capabilities. Be
fore transferring here as a junior,
he attended Brigham Young
University where he partici
pated in several extra curricular
activities and helped redesign
the University's grading policy
in religion classes. It was in this
process that he "confirmed his
inclination to study policy mak
ing," a pursuit which he will
continue through Oxford's
philosophy and politics courses.
Serving for two years as a
Mormon missionary in Ger
many, Canada, and the United
States strengthened the Salt
Lake City native's religious pre
cepts "which guide my life." It
also helped him appreciate "the
awareness that can only come
from actively participating in a
culture different than one's
own;" something he is now
eager to do in England.
Transferring to Stanford and
"interacting with peers and fa
culty with a different orientation
than my own . . . taught me to
question, and has given me a
drive to learn more and more."

gated the Affirmative Action as a
