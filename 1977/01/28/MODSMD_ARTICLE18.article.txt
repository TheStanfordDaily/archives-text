# Dissidents fight UFW pact
## 
### 
Fresno (AP) — Dissident
Teamsters agricultural officials
are suing their parent union, be
cause they feel the union is at
tempting to give Cesar Chavez
sole jurisdiction in organizing
field hands.
Meanwhile in Sacramento,
Chavez and 150 of his United
Farm Workers (UFW) yesterday
marched into the state farm labor
board's headquarters, demand
ing that it speed up its opera
tions.
The suit against the parent un
ion, filed in Superior Court here,
says the Western Conference of
Teamsters has placed its agricul
tural local in trusteeship and has
closed the union's agricultural
labor offices in Stockton, Fresno
and Bakersfield.
The suit makes no mention of
recent negotiations to end the
long, bitter dispute between the
Teamsters and the UFW.
However, Pete Baclig, who
signed the suit as secretary of
Teamsters Agricultural Local
946, said yesterday that the ac
tion is an attempt to stop an ag
reement.
No UFW jurisdiction
"We are against any jurisdic
tional agreement with the
UFW," Baclig said in a tele
phone interview. "We will do
everything that is legally within
our power to stop any agreement
between the UFW and
Teamsters."
Chavez reiterated his previous
denials that a pact has been
reached by which the UFW
would have sole authority in or
ganizing field hands and the
Teamsters sole jurisdiction in
canneries.

"We don't have an agree
ment," Chavez said. "It's just a
big rumor."
Chairman listens
In Sacramento, Gerald Brown,
chairman of the Agricultural
Labor Relations Board, com
mented on the Chavez charges
after a two-hour session.
"We listened to them and
explained what we've been do
ing," said Brown. "Time will see
it improve."
"He didn't make any prom
ises," Chavez told newsmen. "If
we don't get some action we'll
come back with a larger group. It
we have to stay all summer, we'll
stay here."
Dragging its feet
Chavez charged that the board
was dragging its feet on certify
ing elections which the UFW
won, ruling on unfair labor prac
tice charges filed by union
members who were fired, and
deciding whether votes of strik
ers will be counted.
Brown denied that the board
was delaying action. He said it
had been out of business most of
last year because the legislature
cut off its funds, but claimed it
had moved as fast as possible
since it was reactivated in
November.
"We've been asking the work
ers to be patient for a long, long
time." Chavez said. "We're not
going to front for the board any
more."
Deadline dispute
The dispute over votes of
strikers involves a deadline in
the state farm labor law.
The law, which became effec
tive in August 1975, provides
that for elections held within IB
months after the law took effect
involving strikes which started
before the effective date of the
law, the board can make rules for
counting strikers' votes.
Growers say the 18 months is
up Feb. 28. Chavez claims the
deadline should be extended be
cause the board was out of busi
ness for six months, and the in
tent of the law was for strikers'
votes to be counted.
Votes 'crucial'
Chavez says strikers' vote£ are
crucial in determining elections
held, but not certified, at Gallo's
vineyards in Livingston, D'Ar

rigo lettuce fields in the Salinas
and Imperial valleys, Superior
Farming Company's vineyards
at Delano, and at Egg City in
Ventura County.
The UFW lost its first rep
resentation election yesterday
since the California Agricultural
Labor Relations Board resumed
work.
The voters at N. A. Pricola Pro
duce, near Brawley, all Mexican
nationals, cast nine ballots for
the Cesar Chavez union and 12
for no union.
The union also contends that
if an election is thrown out be

cause a grower committed an un
fair practice, strikers should be
allowed to vote in any new elec
tion held after Feb. 28.
Also, the union says strikers
should be able to vote in elec
tions held after Feb. 28 in places
like theCoachella Valley, where
no elections could be held last
year because the board was in
operative during the peak of its
harvest season.
Newsmen and television
cameras wen present when the
Chavez delegation crowded into
a small room in the board's
headquarters.

"We've been asking the work
ers to be patient for a long, long
time." Chavez said. "We're not
going to front for the board any
more."
Deadline dispute
The dispute over votes of
strikers involves a deadline in
the state farm labor law.
The law, which became effec
tive in August 1975, provides
that for elections held within IB
months after the law took effect
involving strikes which started
before the effective date of the
law, the board can make rules for
counting strikers' votes.
Growers say the 18 months is
up Feb. 28. Chavez claims the
deadline should be extended be
cause the board was out of busi
ness for six months, and the in
tent of the law was for strikers'
votes to be counted.
Votes 'crucial'
Chavez says strikers' vote£ are
crucial in determining elections
held, but not certified, at Gallo's
vineyards in Livingston, D'Ar

rigo lettuce fields in the Salinas
and Imperial valleys, Superior
Farming Company's vineyards
at Delano, and at Egg City in
Ventura County.
The UFW lost its first rep
resentation election yesterday
since the California Agricultural
Labor Relations Board resumed
work.
The voters at N. A. Pricola Pro
duce, near Brawley, all Mexican
nationals, cast nine ballots for
the Cesar Chavez union and 12
for no union.
The union also contends that
if an election is thrown out be

cause a grower committed an un
fair practice, strikers should be
allowed to vote in any new elec
tion held after Feb. 28.
Also, the union says strikers
should be able to vote in elec
tions held after Feb. 28 in places
like theCoachella Valley, where
no elections could be held last
year because the board was in
operative during the peak of its
harvest season.
Newsmen and television
cameras wen present when the
Chavez delegation crowded into
a small room in the board's
headquarters.

Cesar Chavez marched on the state's farm labor board head
quarters yesterday, charging the board with delaying action on
certain rulings and certifications. He added that his group
would return and "stay all summer" if no response is forthcom
ing.
Fresno (AP) — Dissident
Teamsters agricultural officials
are suing their parent union, be
cause they feel the union is at
tempting to give Cesar Chavez
sole jurisdiction in organizing
field hands.
Meanwhile in Sacramento,
Chavez and 150 of his United
Farm Workers (UFW) yesterday
marched into the state farm labor
board's headquarters, demand
ing that it speed up its opera
tions.
The suit against the parent un
ion, filed in Superior Court here,
says the Western Conference of
Teamsters has placed its agricul
tural local in trusteeship and has
closed the union's agricultural
labor offices in Stockton, Fresno
and Bakersfield.
The suit makes no mention of
recent negotiations to end the
long, bitter dispute between the
Teamsters and the UFW.
However, Pete Baclig, who
signed the suit as secretary of
Teamsters Agricultural Local
946, said yesterday that the ac
tion is an attempt to stop an ag
reement.
No UFW jurisdiction
"We are against any jurisdic
tional agreement with the
UFW," Baclig said in a tele
phone interview. "We will do
everything that is legally within
our power to stop any agreement
between the UFW and
Teamsters."
Chavez reiterated his previous
denials that a pact has been
reached by which the UFW
would have sole authority in or
ganizing field hands and the
Teamsters sole jurisdiction in
canneries.

"We don't have an agree
ment," Chavez said. "It's just a
big rumor."
Chairman listens
In Sacramento, Gerald Brown,
chairman of the Agricultural
Labor Relations Board, com
mented on the Chavez charges
after a two-hour session.
"We listened to them and
explained what we've been do
ing," said Brown. "Time will see
it improve."
"He didn't make any prom
ises," Chavez told newsmen. "If
we don't get some action we'll
come back with a larger group. It
we have to stay all summer, we'll
stay here."
Dragging its feet
Chavez charged that the board
was dragging its feet on certify
ing elections which the UFW
won, ruling on unfair labor prac
tice charges filed by union
members who were fired, and
deciding whether votes of strik
ers will be counted.
Brown denied that the board
was delaying action. He said it
had been out of business most of
last year because the legislature
cut off its funds, but claimed it
had moved as fast as possible
since it was reactivated in
November.
"We've been asking the work

board's headquarters, demand
ing that it speed up its opera
tions.
The suit against the parent un
ion, filed in Superior Court here,
says the Western Conference of
Teamsters has placed its agricul
tural local in trusteeship and has
closed the union's agricultural
labor offices in Stockton, Fresno
and Bakersfield.
The suit makes no mention of
recent negotiations to end the
long, bitter dispute between the
Teamsters and the UFW.
However, Pete Baclig, who
signed the suit as secretary of
Teamsters Agricultural Local
946, said yesterday that the ac
tion is an attempt to stop an ag
reement.
No UFW jurisdiction
"We are against any jurisdic
tional agreement with the
UFW," Baclig said in a tele
phone interview. "We will do
everything that is legally within
our power to stop any agreement
between the UFW and
Teamsters."
Chavez reiterated his previous
denials that a pact has been
reached by which the UFW
would have sole authority in or
ganizing field hands and the
Teamsters sole jurisdiction in
canneries.

"We don't have an agree
ment," Chavez said. "It's just a
big rumor."
Chairman listens
In Sacramento, Gerald Brown,
chairman of the Agricultural
Labor Relations Board, com
mented on the Chavez charges
after a two-hour session.
"We listened to them and
explained what we've been do
ing," said Brown. "Time will see
it improve."
"He didn't make any prom
ises," Chavez told newsmen. "If
we don't get some action we'll
come back with a larger group. It
we have to stay all summer, we'll
stay here."
Dragging its feet
Chavez charged that the board
was dragging its feet on certify
ing elections which the UFW
won, ruling on unfair labor prac
tice charges filed by union
members who were fired, and
deciding whether votes of strik
ers will be counted.
Brown denied that the board
was delaying action. He said it
had been out of business most of
last year because the legislature
cut off its funds, but claimed it
had moved as fast as possible
since it was reactivated in
November.
"We've been asking the work
ers to be patient for a long, long
time." Chavez said. "We're not
going to front for the board any
more."
Deadline dispute
The dispute over votes of
strikers involves a deadline in
the state farm labor law.
The law, which became effec
tive in August 1975, provides
that for elections held within IB
months after the law took effect
involving strikes which started
before the effective date of the
law, the board can make rules for
counting strikers' votes.
Growers say the 18 months is
up Feb. 28. Chavez claims the
deadline should be extended be
cause the board was out of busi
ness for six months, and the in
tent of the law was for strikers'
votes to be counted.
Votes 'crucial'
Chavez says strikers' vote£ are
crucial in determining elections
held, but not certified, at Gallo's
vineyards in Livingston, D'Ar

rigo lettuce fields in the Salinas
and Imperial valleys, Superior
Farming Company's vineyards
at Delano, and at Egg City in
Ventura County.
The UFW lost its first rep
resentation election yesterday
since the California Agricultural
Labor Relations Board resumed
work.
The voters at N. A. Pricola Pro
duce, near Brawley, all Mexican
nationals, cast nine ballots for
the Cesar Chavez union and 12
for no union.
The union also contends that
if an election is thrown out be

cause a grower committed an un
fair practice, strikers should be
allowed to vote in any new elec
tion held after Feb. 28.
Also, the union says strikers
should be able to vote in elec
tions held after Feb. 28 in places
like theCoachella Valley, where
no elections could be held last
year because the board was in
operative during the peak of its
harvest season.
Newsmen and television
cameras wen present when the
Chavez delegation crowded into
a small room in the board's
headquarters.
