# CIA linked to Irish conflict?
## 
### 
The CIA may be operating in
Northern Ireland, according to
Lucy Haessler who visited the
country in December.
She pointed out Tuesday that
50 per cent of the multinational
corporations in Northern Ireland
were American-owned and said
she thought it significant that
big factories were not bombed.
Haessler, co-chairperson of
the Santa Cruz Chapter of the
Women's International League,
said it was a strongly held theory
that the British Army was in Ire
land partly to protect U.S. capi
tal. She questioned Britain's
ability to afford the billion
pounds needed every year to
maintain its force in Ireland.
Speaking at the Bechtel Inter
national Center, she said many
people believe the CiA is fund
ing the Provisionals.

The Washington Connection —

an article appearing in the De
cember 1975 issue of the United
Irishman.
The article sparked a
Washington Post investigation
into the connection between the
CIA and an organization known
as the Irish National Caucus
(INC). The article stated AFL
CIO Vice President Thomas
"Teddy" Gleason, who is pur
ported to have CIA ties, was
executive secretary of the INC.
Haessler described the British
forces in Northern Ireland as "an
unwelcome presence" adding
that peoplealso wanted to get rid
of paramilitary organizations
from both sides.
Haessler was full of praise for
the women's peace movement
headed by Betty Williams and
Mairead Corrigan. She claimed
the movement had gone a long
way towards unifying Catholics
and Protestants.

She defended the movement
against charges that it had no
program apart from organizing
marches. The women are also
involved in important commun
ity services and planned to build
centers to keep children off the
streets, Haessler said.
One of the terrible consequ
ences of the conflict, she added,
was the psychological damage to
the children of both sides. It was
her opinion that the movement
had set the stage for the recon
ciliation of a people sick of vio
lence.
Haessler paid tribute to the
"eloquence, determination and
courage" of the women who
persevered despite the inhuman
treatment they experienced.
Haessler said one highlight of
the visit was the peace rally, at
tended by more than 15,000
people.

took place in the Valley of

program apart from organizing
marches. The women are also
involved in important commun
ity services and planned to build
centers to keep children off the
streets, Haessler said.
One of the terrible consequ
ences of the conflict, she added,
was the psychological damage to
the children of both sides. It was
her opinion that the movement
had set the stage for the recon
ciliation of a people sick of vio
lence.
Haessler paid tribute to the
"eloquence, determination and
courage" of the women who
persevered despite the inhuman
treatment they experienced.
Haessler said one highlight of
the visit was the peace rally, at
tended by more than 15,000
people.

The CIA may be operating in
Northern Ireland, according to
Lucy Haessler who visited the
country in December.
She pointed out Tuesday that
50 per cent of the multinational
corporations in Northern Ireland
were American-owned and said
she thought it significant that
big factories were not bombed.
Haessler, co-chairperson of
the Santa Cruz Chapter of the
Women's International League,
said it was a strongly held theory
that the British Army was in Ire
land partly to protect U.S. capi
tal. She questioned Britain's
ability to afford the billion
pounds needed every year to
maintain its force in Ireland.
Speaking at the Bechtel Inter
national Center, she said many
people believe the CiA is fund
ing the Provisionals.
Haessler displayed a reprint of
The Washington Connection —

an article appearing in the De
cember 1975 issue of the United
Irishman.
The article sparked a
Washington Post investigation
into the connection between the
CIA and an organization known
as the Irish National Caucus
(INC). The article stated AFL
CIO Vice President Thomas
"Teddy" Gleason, who is pur
ported to have CIA ties, was
executive secretary of the INC.
Haessler described the British
forces in Northern Ireland as "an
unwelcome presence" adding
that peoplealso wanted to get rid
of paramilitary organizations
from both sides.
Haessler was full of praise for
the women's peace movement
headed by Betty Williams and
Mairead Corrigan. She claimed
the movement had gone a long
way towards unifying Catholics
and Protestants.

She defended the movement
against charges that it had no
program apart from organizing
marches. The women are also
involved in important commun
ity services and planned to build
centers to keep children off the
streets, Haessler said.
