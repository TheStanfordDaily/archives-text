# Carter's gas proposal: unprecedented
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Stripped of legalistic jargon,
the emergency legislation proposed Wednesday by
President limmy Carter seeks unprecedented fed
eral authority to ration natural gas.
Congress is expected to approve Carter's request
quickly, under pressure of a gas shortage that has
already idled an estimated 400.000 or more workers
and threatens to grow worse with the predicted
return of severely cold weather.
When he announced his plan. Carter preferred to
call his proposal a "reallocation." hut the bill
would authorize him to order any interstate
pipeline to transfer some of its natural gas to any
other interstate pipeline or local distribution com
pany that needs it desperately for homes, essential
services, small businesses and property protection.
Federal Power Commission rules would do the
rest, guiding the gas first to those top-priority cus
tomers and only after them to other gas-short indus
tries and businesses.
Under Carter's proposal, shifting of gas from
pipeline to pipeline and region to region would

take place regardless of the donor-pipeline's con
tracts to deliver gas to its own lower-priority cus
tomers.
Declining production
For the past six years, U.S. natural gas production
has been steadily declining, unable to meet existing
contracted requirements, much less the potential
new demands of homes and industries.
Cas supplies fell last winter almost 15 per cent
short of requirements despite mild weather, ac
cording to Federal Energy Administration (FEA)
figures.
Many industries had bought gas, at discount
prices, on "interruptible" contracts. Knowing their
gas might be shut off occasionally if shortages de
veloped generally, these industries could turn to
other fuels or alter their operations temporarily
without having to shut down.
No delivery
Even so, nearly seven per cent of the gas due to
customers with "firm" delivery contracts, which

do not provide for interruptions, could not be deli
vered last winter.
For the current winter, the FEA had estimated a
general shortage of nearly 18 per cent and a shor
tage of more than eight per cent on "firm" require
ments — if the weather was "normal."
It isn't.
Cold weather hurts
Unusually cold weather has pushed gas needs
upward by an estimated 600 billion cubic feet this
winter, says Carter's energy adviser James
Schlesinger. That figure would raise the over-all
shortage to more than 22 per cent of requirements.
That shortage is not evenly distributed. Some
pipelines have relatively adequate gas supplies
under long-term contracts while others, whose
purchase contracts have been running out. find
they cannot buy new gas to replace dwindling
supplies, s
Such pipelines are in far worse shape than the
nationwide average, and so are the distribution
utilities that depend on them.
