## Air Force fires at Cards, 69-62 
### Gary Cohen 
Colorado Springs, Colo. — A
funny thing happened on the
way to the Academy. A game
that Stanford was supposed to
have locked up was stolen, and
the Cards fell to a scrappy Air
Force squad, 69-62. Before the
loss, however, there were several
occurrences which make the end
results seem much more plausi
ble.
On Tuesday, in practice,
Wolfe Perry sprained an ankle.
With a cold added to the injury,
Perry's effectiveness was mini
mal. Then Paul Giovacchini and
Jeff McHugh also sprained their
ankles, and the Cards had to op
erate at the bare minimum.
Yet the game was close
throughout. The Cards shot 56
per cent from the floor in the first
half and found themselves in a
38-38 halftime tie.
In the second half it looked as
if only Mike Bratz came to play
for Stanford. Bratz scored 14
points in the second half, and the
rest of the team totaled only 10.
As Air Force coach Hank Egan
said later, "They obviously we
ren't at full strength, but this was
our best game to date. I was
pretty pleased with our defense
in the second half."
Coach Dick Dißiaso pointed to

the injuries as factors in the loss.
"Our offense, without Perry
and McHugh, had no execution.
There are things that Wolfe and
Jeff do that are essential to the
offense.
"We tried to go to Belton more
often, but we couldn't get him
the ball. Air Force played ex
tremely good defense through
out. Our guys were exhausted at
the end." he said.

Paul Giovacchini goes against an opponent in an earlier game this season. The 6-foot-1 guard
from Salt Lake City scored six points against Air Force last night.

Cards' Mike Bratz keeps the ball from"the enemy.'' Bratz
scored 25 points last night in Stanford's 69-62 loss to Air Force.
Colorado Springs, Colo. — A
funny thing happened on the
way to the Academy. A game
that Stanford was supposed to
have locked up was stolen, and
the Cards fell to a scrappy Air
Force squad, 69-62. Before the
loss, however, there were several
occurrences which make the end
results seem much more plausi
ble.
On Tuesday, in practice,
Wolfe Perry sprained an ankle.
With a cold added to the injury,
Perry's effectiveness was mini
mal. Then Paul Giovacchini and
Jeff McHugh also sprained their
ankles, and the Cards had to op
erate at the bare minimum.
Yet the game was close
throughout. The Cards shot 56
per cent from the floor in the first
half and found themselves in a
38-38 halftime tie.
In the second half it looked as
if only Mike Bratz came to play
for Stanford. Bratz scored 14
points in the second half, and the
rest of the team totaled only 10.
As Air Force coach Hank Egan
said later, "They obviously we
ren't at full strength, but this was
our best game to date. I was
pretty pleased with our defense
in the second half."
Coach Dick Dißiaso pointed to

the injuries as factors in the loss.
"Our offense, without Perry
and McHugh, had no execution.
There are things that Wolfe and
Jeff do that are essential to the
offense.
"We tried to go to Belton more
often, but we couldn't get him
the ball. Air Force played ex
tremely good defense through
out. Our guys were exhausted at
the end." he said.
