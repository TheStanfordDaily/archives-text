### Dean Eyre 
Following a week's rest from
I'ac-8 competition, Stanford
gymnasts face UCLA tonight in
the last home meet of the year.
The meet is scheduled for 7 p.m.
in Encina Gym, with the Cards
hoping to show improvement
since the last confrontation of
the two teams during which the
Bruins won. 193.4 to 159.3.
This season is considered a re
building period for Stanford
gymnastics, and a critical part of
the team's success in future com
petition rests upon head coach
Sadao Hamada, now in his fifth
year of guiding the program.
Regarded as one of the leading
coaches for gymnastics in the
country, Hamada also conducts
classes in gymnastics for the
physical education department.
A 1969 graduate of Nippon Col
lege, an internationally
acclaimed producer of gym
nasts. he helped lead his team to
second place in the All-Japan
Championships that year. While
attending Kent State to earn his
master's in physical education,
he assisted in coaching duties
for the school's gymnastics
team.
In competition. Hamada com
piled an impressive record, in
cluding a second in all-around at
the National Senior ASSU
Championships in 1970 and
1971. During 1972, he won the
side horse competition in the
United States Gymnastics Fed
eration meet, and placed third in
USGF and AAU all around com
petition.
The key to returning Stan
ford's gymnastics program to top
form is coaching young athletes
in the finer techniques, the dif
ference that can distinguish a
first place finish from merely
runner-up. One of the top pros
pects is Tad Bostick, a freshman
from Austin, Texas.
Performing in the AAU Junior
Olympics, Bostick finished
fourth in the 13-14 year age
group nationals and sixth in the
15-18 age group.
In high school, Bostick won

the 1976 top all-around state ti
tle, and won the USGF regional
all-around title.
Recalling his first years of
gymnastics, Bostick said, "I
started at 10 working a couple
days a week, and entered a high
class when competing at 12." He
represented both a private club
and his school team during a
very successful high school
career.
The biggest transition from
high school to the college level
has been the number of hours
spent practicing.
"In high school we worked
two hours a night five times a
week," Bostick explained. The
Cards work out for about three
and a half hours an afternoon six
days a week.
The pressure of meets in an
individual sport can affect
athletes in varying degrees, but
Bostick has gotten used to pre
paring for it.
"1 started young. ... In high
school it was kind of a bigger
deal — there was a lot of pressure
to win. Here I'm unknown; no
body knows who I am," he said.
Bostick described this season
as one for rebuilding, with the
team's specialists spreading to
other events. He is very optimis
tic about the Card's future and
described his confidence in
Hamada. saying "As far as
coaching, we're a better team
than the others we've come up
against."
The season has been
scheduled to provide the team
with meet experience, but also
sufficient individual practice
preparation. Bostick said that in
high school his season was
"pretty long, from January to
May. Now it's January to early
March."
The progress this winter has
made the team excited about
next season's squad.
"Everybody's looking forward
to next year. The coach is doing a
lot of recruiting and there'll be
more scholarships. Now there is
only one scholarship," said Bos
tick.

This season is considered a re
building period for Stanford
gymnastics, and a critical part of
the team's success in future com
petition rests upon head coach
Sadao Hamada, now in his fifth
year of guiding the program.
Regarded as one of the leading
coaches for gymnastics in the
country, Hamada also conducts
classes in gymnastics for the
physical education department.
A 1969 graduate of Nippon Col
lege, an internationally
acclaimed producer of gym
nasts. he helped lead his team to
second place in the All-Japan
Championships that year. While
attending Kent State to earn his
master's in physical education,
he assisted in coaching duties
for the school's gymnastics
team.
In competition. Hamada com
piled an impressive record, in
cluding a second in all-around at
the National Senior ASSU
Championships in 1970 and
1971. During 1972, he won the
side horse competition in the
United States Gymnastics Fed
eration meet, and placed third in
USGF and AAU all around com
petition.
The key to returning Stan
ford's gymnastics program to top
form is coaching young athletes
in the finer techniques, the dif
ference that can distinguish a
first place finish from merely
runner-up. One of the top pros
pects is Tad Bostick, a freshman
from Austin, Texas.
Performing in the AAU Junior
Olympics, Bostick finished
fourth in the 13-14 year age
group nationals and sixth in the
15-18 age group.
In high school, Bostick won

the 1976 top all-around state ti
tle, and won the USGF regional
all-around title.
Recalling his first years of
gymnastics, Bostick said, "I
started at 10 working a couple
days a week, and entered a high
class when competing at 12." He
represented both a private club
and his school team during a
very successful high school
career.
The biggest transition from
high school to the college level
has been the number of hours
spent practicing.
"In high school we worked
two hours a night five times a
week," Bostick explained. The
Cards work out for about three
and a half hours an afternoon six
days a week.
The pressure of meets in an
individual sport can affect
athletes in varying degrees, but
Bostick has gotten used to pre
paring for it.
"1 started young. ... In high
school it was kind of a bigger
deal — there was a lot of pressure
to win. Here I'm unknown; no
body knows who I am," he said.
Bostick described this season
as one for rebuilding, with the
team's specialists spreading to
other events. He is very optimis
tic about the Card's future and
described his confidence in
Hamada. saying "As far as
coaching, we're a better team
than the others we've come up
against."
The season has been
scheduled to provide the team
with meet experience, but also
sufficient individual practice
preparation. Bostick said that in
high school his season was
"pretty long, from January to
May. Now it's January to early
March."
The progress this winter has
made the team excited about
next season's squad.
"Everybody's looking forward
to next year. The coach is doing a
lot of recruiting and there'll be
more scholarships. Now there is
only one scholarship," said Bos
tick.

I'ac-8 competition, Stanford
