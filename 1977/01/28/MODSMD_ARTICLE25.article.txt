# Spangler finds success through starvation diet
## 
### Ben Webster 
Last year he was out for the season after a
concussion, strained ankle, separated shoul
der and mononucleosis set in. And this year he
may not even have a season after the Athletic
Department reassesses the status of its club
sports program. But this year is Stanford wres
tler Jim Spangler's time to shine.
Spangler sparkled in this month's tourna
ments, winning all three of his matches at the
Humboldt invitational, and placing fourth in
California at last week's Bakersfield Champ
ionships. But the brown-haired, red tank
topped sophomore, now 11-3, was not satisfied
with his Bakersfield performance. It conjured

"I never seem to have any luck down there,"
he began the story of the day that ended both
his wrestling and academic careers at Los Al
tos' Await High. Spangler had cruised to a re
spectable 41-0 tab and the climax of his season
was the California State Finals match in
Bakersfield.
With six seconds left. Jim led 3-2. "After the
guy threw me completely off the mat, the next
thing 1 knew 1 had blacked out for a second. I
had lost 4-3, and I had my hands locked around
the neck of the referee."
A post-wrestle ensued, as team mates drag
ged the furious loser away from the terrified
official. Spangler never got his second place
medal. Nor any other tournament honors, since

his name was stricken entirely from the state's
record books.
Out-of-towner
His wrestling and All Central Coast defen
sive half-backing careers behind him, Jim
graduated at mid term and left Await im
mediately. He and a friend then proceeded to
wander around the West. The odometer of the
family station wagon clicked off 8000 miles,
the pals skiied the Rockies up and down, and
Spangler visited the many universities that
had been recruiting him throughout the year.
"That trip was the one thing responsible for
my coming to Stanford. My parents were both
alumni, and of course they sort of wanted me to
follow along. But I had no interest in Stanford
— I really didn't want to go here."
Charisma
It was only after Spangler visited the other
Pac-8 campuses and universities throughout
the western states that he realized that "none of
them had the warm, friendly quality of stu
dents I'd always seen at Stanford." It was this
"quality" — not the wishes of his parents or the
coaxing of excited recruiters — that made up
Jim's mind.
Certainly some of the other schools showed
off better wrestling programs than Stanford.
Even today, powerhouses DC-Davis and
UCLA, well aware of the system's precarious
position on the Farm, are still offering Jim full
scholarships for his last two years. The only
thing that might possibly interest Spangler
would be a transfer south for just winter quar
ter so that he could continue wrestling if the
Stanford athletic decision goes the wrong way.
Starvation diet
But a dedicated wrestler has to do a lot on his
own, too. Spangler does more than a lot. The
144 pounder (his normal weight is 165) skips
every lunch, all but two breakfasts, and makes
only one trip weekly to the dinner table.
"Ever since seventh grade I've been fortu
nate to have fine coaches and good programs.
After seven years, you get used to starving."
Spangler's diet, which would do little to fill
out a molting cardinal, is observed throughout
wrestling season. He runs and lifts weights
year 'round. Jim also stays in shape by playing
tennis and handball, hunting on his uncle's
ranch, and hoping for an occasional ski trip to
the Sierras.
Dying to get in
In marked contrast to his rival UCLA
wrestlers, many of whom were suspended this
year for academic infractions, Spangler thinks
of other things besides locker and pinning
combinations. His favorite subjects are in the
economic field, and he hopes to spend two
years in business school before entering the
managerial phase of his father's large funeral
directing business in Los Altos.
Spangler's athletic future at Stanford is filled
with uncertainty. But certainly Jim is one of the
finest wrestlers on the coast.
At least the Pac-8 finals will be held at Cor
vallis, not in Bakersfield. And the NCAA's are
in Oklahoma.


up memories of another less than successful
journey to that town two years ago.
