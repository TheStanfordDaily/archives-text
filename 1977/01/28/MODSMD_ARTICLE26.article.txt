# Belton: A Long Way From New York
## 
### Gary Sprague 
So you want to know a little about what
Kimberly Belton is like. Consider this, if you
will:
Cheerleader. Running up and down the
court, yelling encouragement and slapping
five. Exulting after a slam dunk. Keeping his
teammates in stitches with slapstick
routines.
Yep. say his teammates, that's Kim Bel
ton.
Consider this, then, if you will:
Quiet. Reserved. A freshman 3000 miles
from home adjusting to life at a large uni
versity. A few close friends.
Aha, say his dormmates, that's the real
Kim Belton.
What's my line?
It may seem difficult to reconcile the two
extremes of ebullience and reticence in one
person, but Belton is just such a synthesis.
"I'm really two different persons," Belton
said. "Basketball is one life, and my per
sonal life is another. On the court I'm outgo
ing. Outside I'm pretty easygoing. It comes
from basketball being a world in itself."
Wolfe Perry, one of Belton's close friends
on and off the court, found the freshman
forward from the Bronx something of an
enigma when they first met.
Two personalties
"Off the court he's quiet and to himself,"
Perry said, "but he's hyper and talkative on
the court. I used to think he didn't like being
here (because he was so quiet), but that's
just the way he is."
Belton's public exuberance is a continua
tion of a similar high school predisposition.
By bringing this attitude towards the game
to Stanford, a school not noted for colorful
basketball players, Belton was immediately
tagged as the team cheerleader.
"He's a lot of fun to be around," Perry
said. "But he has a horrible sense of humor.
He does funny little slapstick things. Bet
ween him and Jay Carter, you'll laugh all
day."
Fun and games
Belton has not turned the Card practices
into a revival of Luugh-in, however. Since
one of coach Dick Dißiaso's rules forbids

joking and laughing during workouts, Perry
noted that the Carter and Belton Show usu
ally performs out of Dißiaso's sight.
Belton's other major contribution to keep
ing the team up has been his liberal distribu
tion of nicknames to everyone he comes ac
ross. "We have thousands," Belton said.
"One guy might have three or four. Every
body has a hand in it."
Nicknames
Some of the nicknames have been cir
culating since the first practice: A Belton
sampler:
Tom Schmalzried: "Dennis the Menace,
because of his haircut."
Kim Belton: "Willie, because some TV
announcer called me Willie Belton."
Jay Carter: "Jimmy Carter."
Wolfe Perry: "He doesn't need a
nickname."
Dozing oil'
Off the court, Belton's evenness of com
posure goes beyond equanimity to a some
times surprising degree.
"He falls asleep a lot in Human Sex
class," Ferry said, "which 1 find to be very
strange."
Much of his reserve stems from the dif
ficult adjustments required of a native of
New York. Being 3000 miles away from
family and friends made the first few
months difficult. Other tensions were
added by the pressure inherent on freshmen
starting in big time college basketball. With
Ceorge Schader out for the season, Belton
was expected to carry much of the Stanford
front line load from the start.
Wear and tear
The biggest transition from high school to
college ball has been the more intensive
physical wear and tear caused by road trips,
hotel rooms and plane schedules, as well as
the faster paced and more physical college
game. And although Belton is not the single
focus of the Stanford team, his status as a
starting freshman has singled him out for
increased attention.
"In the Washington State game," Belton
said, "we were down by five with a few
seconds left. Somebody from the crowd yel
led, 'Hey Belton, welcome to the Pac-B.'

Hey.' I told him, 'I'll he back.' They know
I'm a freshman. They thrive on taunting
you."
Loser image
Coming from the East Coast, Belton
brought clean slate of expectations to
California. What he has seen is an apparent
prejudice towards Stanford basketball on
the part of the Pac-8 and sportswriters.
"It seems to me people in the Pac-8 don't
want Stanford to do well." Belton said. The
consensus, he continued, is that in the
natural order of life in the Pac-8, Stanford is
not supposed to be a winning team.
"Stanford has been so low," Belton said,
"they don't want (Stanford) to go up."
Belton claimed that Stanford's academic
reputation provided an easy excuse —
academic schools aren't supposed to win.
Blow out
Another example of sports pundits writ
ing off Stanford comes from the Arizona
game. Although Stanford played well, the
papers seemed to degrade the effort by not
ing benevolently that the Cards were not
blown out of the arena.
As for the next four years, Belton hopes to
enter the field of broadcast communication
with the goal of helping family and friends
who have helped him get to Stanford.
"They're not doing too well now," Belton
said. "I want to help them. I'm in a good
position to help them."
Until then, Stanford fans will be treated to
Belton's enthusiastic style of play. For Pac-8
opponents, they might wish Belton would
calm down a bit,
Gimme five
"In the Washington State game he
dunked one," Perry recalled, "and almost
tore some guy's head off. (Kim) was jump
ing in the air, slapping five. Meanwhile,
Washington State snuck downcourt and
scored, so he had to turn around and run
backupcourt. That's the type of person he is
— exciteable."
Perry paused for a minute, then looked up
smiling.
"And that's kind of dangerous," Perry
said, "because he's so big."
