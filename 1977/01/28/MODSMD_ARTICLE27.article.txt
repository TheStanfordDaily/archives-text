tage of natural gas in several other Eastern and Midwest
ern states has closed schools, factories and municipal
buildings.

states.
I he governor also asked that all restaurants, theaters,
sports arenas and other non-essential commercial firms

declare the state a disaster area and thus trigger a variety of
federal aid programs to help cushion the economic losses
of last week's killer freeze of fruits and vegetables.

strictions on burning air-polluting, high-sulfur coal as a
natural gas shortage idled more than 22,000 workers in

Congress considers tax cut proposals
Washington — The Carter administration said yester
day it is planning more individual and business tax cuts in
addition to the quick tax rebate of $50 for nearly every
American.
Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal told a House
Budget Committee hearing that Carter's $31 -bi 1 lion
economic stimulus plan of tax breaks and jobs programs is
just the first step to be taken by the new administration.
The rebate checks could be in the mail as early as April,
under Carter's program.

Mondale affirms U.S. support of Britain
London — Vice President W'alter Mondale and British
Prime Minister James Callaghan talked yesterday about
international economic problems and southern Africa and
then announced that Callaghan, at President Jimmy Car
ter's invitation, would visit the United States in March.
In a brief, joint news conference after a private meeting
that lasted more than an hour, Mondale told Callaghan the
United States government was standing fully behind
British efforts at mediating the transfer of power to the
black majority in Rhodesia.
The overnight stop in London is part of Mondale's
10-day world tour in which he is getting acquainted with
leaders of Western Europe and Japan and talking primar
ily about economic problems of the developed nations and
how they can affect the underdeveloped nations.
Vance softens U.S. position on Cuba
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance says the
Carter administration would regard Cuba's release of
political prisoners as an indication Cuba is seriously in
terested in restoring relations with the United States, ac
cording to testimony released yesterday.
Vance offered this viewpoint in response to written
questions put to him Jan. 11 by Sen. Clifford Case (R-N.J.).
Case is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee which questioned Vance on his nomination to succeed
Henry Kissinger as secretary of state.
Carter aides have said that although the president wants
to improve relations with Cuba, he does not necessarily
expect quick progress. The administration is considering
easing a U.S. trade embargo on Cubd as a friendly gesture
that might lead to talks with the Castro government.
'Living will' bill clears hurdle
Sacramento — A bill to make a portion of California's
landmark "right-to-death" law retroactive won narrow
approval in the Assembly yesterday.
The measure, AB 14, by Assemblyman Barry Keene
(D-Eureka), would validate so-called living wills that were
signed before Jan. 1, authorizing a doctor to remove life
support equipment from a dying patient.
The law, the first of its kind in the nation, took effect this
month. But Keene said he thinks some people mistakenly
thought it went into effect when Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
signed it last Sept. 30.
The bill now goes before the Senate.
Pope rejects female priest prpposal
Vatican City — The Roman Catholic Church said yes
terday it will not ordain women as priests because Christ
"was and remains a man," and his apostles, all men, chose
other men as their successors.

Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith went
directly against the recommendation of another Vatican
body and practice among Protestant Christian
denominations of ordaining women. .
