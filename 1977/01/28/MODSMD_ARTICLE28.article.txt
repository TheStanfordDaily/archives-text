USE panel nominates interim president
The executive committee of the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union elected group representative
Anne Schlagenhatt to serve as interim president until the
regular election of union officials in April.
Schlagenhaft must still he approved by USE's members
at the membership meeting next Tuesday. She said, "I
don't foresee any problems ... the membership doesn't
really have a choice."
She will fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Roger
Hardy, who resigned the presidency of the union Jan. 12.
Schlagenhaft, 26, was the unanimous choice of the
executive committee. A life sciences technician at the
Medical Center, she has served as shop steward for the
Medical Center and as a contract negotiator.
She said she plans to keep her Stanford job while she
serves as president, since she will not draw a salary from
the union. She also says she doesn't plan to run for presi
dent in April.
