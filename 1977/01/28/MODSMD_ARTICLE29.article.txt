# Pregnancy rate here declines

The number of pregnancies here in
1976 decreased for the first time in
three years, Cowell Health Center
statistics revealed recently.
"I really don't have any idea why,"
said Cowell physician John Dorman,
immediately dismissing increasing
abstinence as a possible cause. "1 cer
tainly doubt that people's sexual prac
tices have changed," he said.
Dorman did note, however, that the
use of diaphragms has definitely been
"on the upswing" for the past two
years. "People are getting more skilled
with the use of them. They can be ef
fective 96-97 per cent of the time if
used religiously and used correctly,"
he said.

The number of pregnancies totaled
92 for last year, as opposed to 103 in
1975, 79 in 1974 and 66 in 1973. The
numbers do, however, include mar
ried students and their spouses, and
includes both desired and unwanted
pregnancies.
The statistics did not distinguish be
tween married and unmarried
mothers.
Cowell is expecting a large compu
ter printout evaluation that will give
"details on who the people are who are
getting pregnant," Dorman said. At
tention will then be focused mainly on
the unwanted pregnancies.
"Obviously desired pregnancies are
not a problem," Dorman said.

If it could be determined specifi i: a I lv
which "populations" on campus were
having the most problems with un
wanted pregnancies, the people .it
Peer Counseling working in conjunt
tion with Cowell could then foc us
their control efforts towards those
people, he said.
Counseling efforts in the past have
focused on freshmen, who have gener
ally contributed very little to the
number of pregnancies, Dorman said
He said the low number of freshman
pregnancies was not necessarily a di
rect result of counseling, but indicated
that perhaps freshmen don't get to
know each other well enough to lind
themselves in pregnancy-producing
situations.
