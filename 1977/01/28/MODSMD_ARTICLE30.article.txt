# Grads face better job market
## 
### Tim Reagan Staff writer 
The job outlook for Stanford graduates is fairly good this
year, according to Ralph Keller, Stanford Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC) director.
Keller expects a good year for students with engineering
degrees and most others. As is traditionally the case, the
picture is not so good for liberal arts students.
"The two best indicators of the job picture are what the
College Placement Council (CPC) tells us and what hap
pened last year," said Keller.
According to the CPC, job offers nationwide are up 20
per cent this year over last year. Stanford experienced an
11 percent increase last yearand expects another increase
this year, according to Keller.
Statistics misleading
These statistics may be somewhat misleading and are
difficult to interpret, said Keller. They count jobs offered,
not jobs filled. One person may receive seven offers, but
will only be able to accept one. Presumably, those he

rejects will be filled by someone else.
"We can't be sure of this year's result until the year is
over," said Keller.
Stanford graduates have not had much trouble in the
past finding jobs. According to Keller, this is because
graduates here are of high quality.
Hiring women
Women still face some discrimination, said Keller, but
that is rapidly decreasing. The situation is much better
now than it was even three or four years ago. he added.
Underemployment is becoming a problem, said Keller.
While the U.S. turns out over one million graduates with
baccalaureate degrees each year — a four-fold increase
over 1950 — the number of suitable jobs has increased
only 15 per cent There are more qualified candidates than
jobs, so some people must accept jobs for which they are
overqualified.
Eighty per cent of the job market is in the field of busi
ness. For this reason, liberal arts students are at a disad
vantage, said Keller.
