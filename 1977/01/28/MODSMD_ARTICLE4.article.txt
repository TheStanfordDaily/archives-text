# Keep Delts off campus, university panel advises

### Pan Demetrakakes Staff writer 
The petition of the Delta Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity for
reinstatement on campus should be denied, but their sus
pension should be reduced from three years to two, the
Subcommittee on Residences of the Committee on Ser
vices to Students voted 5-2 last night.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson
will forward the recommendation, along with his own, to
Dean of Students James Lyons, who will make the final
decision. Lyons' decision will be subject to review by
President Richard Lyman.
Neither Robinson nor Lyons could be reached for com
ment. However, subcommittee member Greg Fieschala
said, "Although he is not obligated to, I would expect
(Robinson) to follow the recommendation."
Delta Tau Delta was suspended for three years last June
following a spree the previous month in which several
members vandalized two other frats.
When he approved the decision to suspend the frater
nity, Lyons included a provision allowing the Delts to
petition for reinstatement in one year. He included criteria
which he felt the Delts should fulfill in order to be
reinstated.

The majority report of the subcommittee tested the Delts
against these criteria and stated that they did not satisfy
several of them, according to Pieschala.
One of the most important criteria requires the Delts to
institute steps for "accountability" of the members' ac
tions. The report said that the subcommittee appreciated
the Delts' actions in this regard, but stated: "The commit
tee learnea that a certain number of sophomores were part
of the incident. . . . The reinstitution of the house . 11 au
tumn would effectively mean that these questionable par
ticipants would be seniors in the house."
On this point, the report added: "The presence of self
policing. . .wouldbesoprohibitiveastoiinpairDeltaTau
Delta's functioning as a viable living unit."
However, the minority report, written by Chairman Tim
Ferguson and DeWayne Purslev, says, "Those implicated
in the crimes last May have long since been expelled by
Delta Tau Delta."
Steve Schwartz, a spokesman for the Delts, put it more
succinctly: "If we meet the criteria and then they say
'That's not enough,' then the criteria are bullshit.
"Their decision really disregards all the effort we
made," Schwartz went on. "We've busted our butt. 1 don't
see what more we can do."
