# Administrators mull means to collect debt from Iranians
## 
### Mike Charlson Jim Tranquada Staff writers 
University officials remain optimis
tic that the approximately $425,000
still outstanding on the university's
contract with National Iranian Radio-
Television (NIRT) would be paid by
the Iranians as the contract nears com
pletion.
Despite official optimism, however,
the university is looking into legal as
pects of the situation, according to
Mike Hudnall, staff counsel for the Of
fice of Business and Finance.
"We are looking into all available
channels for getting the money, and
legal channels is one of them," Hud
nall said.
University obligations under the
contract will be completed after sub
mission of final reports by principal
researcher Bruce Lusignan, according
to Earl Cilley, director of sponsored
projects.
Lusignan, an electrical engineering
associate professor, is expected to
finish the reports in about a week, Cil
ley said.
University handling
Asst. Sponsored Projects Director
Jon Erickson mentioned that univer
sity handling of the Iranians' slow
payment would reflect three main
areas of concern, including the finan
cial cost to the university, the universi
ty's research reputation and the uni
versity's relationship with the Iranian
government.
Hudnall stressed that legal channels

would be a matter of last resort, and
that "we are nowhere near that yet."
However, he said that the university
is willing to do whatever is necessary
to recover the money.
"We consider the contract valid and
enforceable," Hudnall said. "I'm sure
we will take all the steps necessary to
enforce it."
No comment
Iranian officials have declined to
comment on the matter. Contacted by
the Daily, M. Fartash, commercial
counselor with the Iranian Embassy in
Washington, said that all comment
had to come directly from NIRT in
Teheran. He suggested that contact be
made by letter through the embassy.
"Any organization back home is
fully independent," Fartash
explained. "They can do whatever
they want."
Meanwhile, deliberations of the "in
formal faculty group" looking into
university performance on the con
tract continued. Cilley said he expects
a report from the group "reasonably
soon."
Public report?
He said he felt that the results would
eventually be made public.
"I would think that eventually it (the
report) would come into some kind of
public domain," Cilley said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs here, reported that an
updated report on the NIRT contract
was not scheduled for the Board of
Trustees meeting on Feb. 7.
Information that a problem existed
with payment on the contract first sur
faced when the Daily learned that the
board would hear a report on it at its
regular December meeting.
Board not alarmed
Yet board members said they felt
that the information provided them
included no cause for alarm. Trustee
P'lora Hewlett reported that "very little
was told to us. What was told to us was
not disturbing to me," she said.
Trustees Otis Pease and Thomas
Pike echoed Hewlett's assessment as
did Trustee William Ayer.

"It wasn't my impression that the
university had not fulfilled its end of
the contract," Ayer said.
Go learn something
In a second telephone conversation,
however, Ayer declined to comment
further.
"I don't think it (the contract prob
lem) is an appropriate subject for you
or me. Why don't you go to class and
try to learn something instead of trying
to change the world?" he said.
Cilley said that Erickson was incor
rect in a Daily article on Jan. 21, that if
the money was not recovered, it would
be taken out of the operating budget,
which is funded by tuition.
Kenneth Creighton. university con
troller, said that the university main
tains a reserve fund "that has been
built up over the past number of years
tOr Da a ' debts and unallowable ex
penses."
Not bad yet
Cilley stressed that the NIRT con
tract did not fall into the category of
bad debts yet. He explained that until
the university files the final reports, its
obligations under the contract are not
complete. Presently, the Iranians are
"just late paying us," he said.
According to a study conducted by
the American Council on Education,
released earlier this month, 49 Ameri
can colleges and universities "already
had or expected soon to have formal
links" with Iranian institutions as of
last May.
Of those contacted by the Daily, in
cluding UCLA, USC, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Harvard and
the Stanford School of Education, only
one minor problem with payment
could be found.
Lester Cordon, director of the Har
vard Institute of International De
velopment, reported that his agency's
multimillion-dollar contract had some
slow payment problems a few months
ago. They are all cleared up now. how
ever, and work is continuing, he said.
Overall, comments describing rela
tions with Iran as "excellent" were
common.

eventually be made public.
"I would think that eventually it (the
report) would come into some kind of
public domain," Cilley said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs here, reported that an
updated report on the NIRT contract
was not scheduled for the Board of
Trustees meeting on Feb. 7.
Information that a problem existed
with payment on the contract first sur
faced when the Daily learned that the
board would hear a report on it at its
regular December meeting.
Board not alarmed
Yet board members said they felt
that the information provided them
included no cause for alarm. Trustee
P'lora Hewlett reported that "very little
was told to us. What was told to us was
not disturbing to me," she said.
Trustees Otis Pease and Thomas
Pike echoed Hewlett's assessment as
did Trustee William Ayer.

"It wasn't my impression that the
university had not fulfilled its end of
the contract," Ayer said.
Go learn something
In a second telephone conversation,
however, Ayer declined to comment
further.
"I don't think it (the contract prob
lem) is an appropriate subject for you
or me. Why don't you go to class and
try to learn something instead of trying
to change the world?" he said.
Cilley said that Erickson was incor
rect in a Daily article on Jan. 21, that if
the money was not recovered, it would
be taken out of the operating budget,
which is funded by tuition.
Kenneth Creighton. university con
troller, said that the university main
tains a reserve fund "that has been
built up over the past number of years
tOr Da a ' debts and unallowable ex
penses."
Not bad yet
Cilley stressed that the NIRT con
tract did not fall into the category of
bad debts yet. He explained that until
the university files the final reports, its
obligations under the contract are not
complete. Presently, the Iranians are
"just late paying us," he said.
According to a study conducted by
the American Council on Education,
released earlier this month, 49 Ameri
can colleges and universities "already
had or expected soon to have formal
links" with Iranian institutions as of
last May.
Of those contacted by the Daily, in
cluding UCLA, USC, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Harvard and
the Stanford School of Education, only
one minor problem with payment
could be found.
Lester Cordon, director of the Har
vard Institute of International De
velopment, reported that his agency's
multimillion-dollar contract had some
slow payment problems a few months
ago. They are all cleared up now. how
ever, and work is continuing, he said.
Overall, comments describing rela
tions with Iran as "excellent" were
common.
University officials remain optimis
tic that the approximately $425,000
still outstanding on the university's
contract with National Iranian Radio-
Television (NIRT) would be paid by
the Iranians as the contract nears com
pletion.
Despite official optimism, however,
the university is looking into legal as
pects of the situation, according to
Mike Hudnall, staff counsel for the Of
fice of Business and Finance.
"We are looking into all available
channels for getting the money, and
legal channels is one of them," Hud
nall said.
University obligations under the
contract will be completed after sub
mission of final reports by principal
researcher Bruce Lusignan, according
to Earl Cilley, director of sponsored
projects.
Lusignan, an electrical engineering
associate professor, is expected to
finish the reports in about a week, Cil
ley said.
University handling
Asst. Sponsored Projects Director
Jon Erickson mentioned that univer
sity handling of the Iranians' slow
payment would reflect three main
areas of concern, including the finan
cial cost to the university, the universi
ty's research reputation and the uni
versity's relationship with the Iranian
government.
Hudnall stressed that legal channels

would be a matter of last resort, and
that "we are nowhere near that yet."
However, he said that the university
is willing to do whatever is necessary
to recover the money.
"We consider the contract valid and
enforceable," Hudnall said. "I'm sure
we will take all the steps necessary to
enforce it."
No comment
Iranian officials have declined to
comment on the matter. Contacted by
the Daily, M. Fartash, commercial
counselor with the Iranian Embassy in
Washington, said that all comment
had to come directly from NIRT in
Teheran. He suggested that contact be
made by letter through the embassy.
"Any organization back home is
fully independent," Fartash
explained. "They can do whatever
they want."
Meanwhile, deliberations of the "in
formal faculty group" looking into
university performance on the con
tract continued. Cilley said he expects
a report from the group "reasonably
soon."

Institute of Technology, Harvard and
the Stanford School of Education, only
one minor problem with payment
could be found.
Lester Cordon, director of the Har
vard Institute of International De
velopment, reported that his agency's
multimillion-dollar contract had some
slow payment problems a few months
ago. They are all cleared up now. how
ever, and work is continuing, he said.
Overall, comments describing rela
tions with Iran as "excellent" were
common.
University officials remain optimis
tic that the approximately $425,000
still outstanding on the university's
contract with National Iranian Radio-
Television (NIRT) would be paid by
the Iranians as the contract nears com
pletion.
Despite official optimism, however,
the university is looking into legal as
pects of the situation, according to
Mike Hudnall, staff counsel for the Of
fice of Business and Finance.
"We are looking into all available
channels for getting the money, and
legal channels is one of them," Hud
nall said.
University obligations under the
contract will be completed after sub
mission of final reports by principal
researcher Bruce Lusignan, according
to Earl Cilley, director of sponsored
projects.
Lusignan, an electrical engineering
associate professor, is expected to
finish the reports in about a week, Cil
ley said.
University handling
Asst. Sponsored Projects Director
Jon Erickson mentioned that univer
sity handling of the Iranians' slow
payment would reflect three main
areas of concern, including the finan
cial cost to the university, the universi
ty's research reputation and the uni
versity's relationship with the Iranian
government.
Hudnall stressed that legal channels

would be a matter of last resort, and
that "we are nowhere near that yet."
However, he said that the university
is willing to do whatever is necessary
to recover the money.
"We consider the contract valid and
enforceable," Hudnall said. "I'm sure
we will take all the steps necessary to
enforce it."
No comment
Iranian officials have declined to
comment on the matter. Contacted by
the Daily, M. Fartash, commercial
counselor with the Iranian Embassy in
Washington, said that all comment
had to come directly from NIRT in
Teheran. He suggested that contact be
made by letter through the embassy.
"Any organization back home is
fully independent," Fartash
explained. "They can do whatever
they want."
Meanwhile, deliberations of the "in
formal faculty group" looking into
university performance on the con
tract continued. Cilley said he expects
a report from the group "reasonably
soon."
Public report?
He said he felt that the results would
eventually be made public.
"I would think that eventually it (the
report) would come into some kind of
public domain," Cilley said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs here, reported that an
updated report on the NIRT contract
was not scheduled for the Board of
Trustees meeting on Feb. 7.
Information that a problem existed
with payment on the contract first sur
faced when the Daily learned that the
board would hear a report on it at its
regular December meeting.
Board not alarmed
Yet board members said they felt
that the information provided them
included no cause for alarm. Trustee
P'lora Hewlett reported that "very little
was told to us. What was told to us was
not disturbing to me," she said.
Trustees Otis Pease and Thomas
Pike echoed Hewlett's assessment as
did Trustee William Ayer.

"It wasn't my impression that the
university had not fulfilled its end of
the contract," Ayer said.
Go learn something
In a second telephone conversation,
however, Ayer declined to comment
further.
"I don't think it (the contract prob
lem) is an appropriate subject for you
or me. Why don't you go to class and
try to learn something instead of trying
to change the world?" he said.
Cilley said that Erickson was incor
rect in a Daily article on Jan. 21, that if
the money was not recovered, it would
be taken out of the operating budget,
which is funded by tuition.
Kenneth Creighton. university con
troller, said that the university main
tains a reserve fund "that has been
built up over the past number of years
tOr Da a ' debts and unallowable ex
penses."
Not bad yet
Cilley stressed that the NIRT con
tract did not fall into the category of
bad debts yet. He explained that until
the university files the final reports, its
obligations under the contract are not
complete. Presently, the Iranians are
"just late paying us," he said.
According to a study conducted by
the American Council on Education,
released earlier this month, 49 Ameri
can colleges and universities "already
had or expected soon to have formal
links" with Iranian institutions as of
last May.
