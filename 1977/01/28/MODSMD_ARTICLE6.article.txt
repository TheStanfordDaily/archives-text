Students who plan to attend medical
school are now required to take the
New Medical College Admission Test
(NMCAT), being given for the first
time this spring.
According to the NMCAT student
manual, "the test was designed in an
attempt to assess not only the student's
knowledge in the specific science
areas of biology, chemistry and
physics, but also his or her analytical
skills. Every effort was made in the test
development to assure that these as
sessments are particularly relevant to
the content of medical curricula and
the practice of medicine."
One Stanford student who took the
old MCAT suggested that a new test
was necessary because "people were
catching on" to the old one.
"The old test had four parts, and
they were all pretty straightforward.
People knew what to expect on the
test, so they were studying for it,"he
said.
Preparatory school
Some students he knew had taken a
preparatory course offered by a com
mercial school and had received ex
ceptionally high test scores, presuma
bly as a result, he added.
Another pre-med here had a diffe
rent criticism of the MCAT. "The old
one had a general information section

where you had to know trivia from
other areas, such as humanities and
social science," he mentioned. "They
were trying to see if students were
well-rounded, but it's really impossi
ble to test for something like that."
The new test was developed by the
American Institute for Research in the
Behavioral Sciences under the direc
tion of the Association of American
Medical Colleges.
Test sections
The NMCAT has four sections and
six separate scores: science (with sub
sections and separate scores on biol
ogy, chemistry and physics), science
problems, skills analysis: reading and
skills analysis: quantitative. The
scores will range from Ito 15,15 being
the highest.
The NMCAT student manual out
lines in more detail what information
will be needed for the test. The
Academic Information Center (AIC)
strongly recommends that all students
who plan to take the test consult this
manual, which is available at the AIC!.
and will soon be in the Stanford
Bookstore.
In general, the test questions on the
NMCAT try to determine how well the
student can apply information ob
tained from a written passage or graph
to problems related to the practice of
medicine.

NMCAT try to determine how well the
student can apply information ob
tained from a written passage or graph
to problems related to the practice of
medicine.
