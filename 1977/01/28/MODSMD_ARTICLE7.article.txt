## Opinions Viewpoint Some parting thoughts 
### 
It's time for me to clear out my desk, so I'll
leave you with some parting thoughts.
I've learned it's impossible to radically
change the Daily in one volume. But I think I've
given it a push in the right direction.
Specifically, I hope the Daily has been more
than just a less-boring alternative to a lecture in
an early-morning class. If you've looked for
ward to reading any of our editions this year, I'll
be satisfied.
People tell me the Daily is biased — except
things have been better this year. They say the
Daily is bland — except this year. Comments
like those indicate a change is taking place —
one which I think is for the better.
It's been manifested in several ways. For one,
the news you read every day is more likely to
come from one of our reporters than from the
University News Service or another news
paper. Our corps of "beat" reporters, assigned
to cover various sectors in the university, has
made it possible.
Further, I think the paper is better looking
than it has been in previous years. The color
picture on today's front page is a case in point.
Some would complain that the Daily should
not spend its money on such things. The color
picture cost about 0.1 per cent of our yearly
operating budget. But if it has brightened the
day of some of our readers, I think it's worth it.
Clearly, though, it is a luxury, and one which
nobody should expect to see more than once a

year, for a change of pace.
The Daily faces some rough times ahead. Al
though our financial situation has improved
dramatically from what it was three years ago
— when the Daily's publisher almost went
bankrupt — the corporation's reserve fund is
still dangerously low. A bad year for advertis
ing sales —which comprise some 83 per cent of
our $300,000 annual revenues — would de
stroy us.
I also perceive a more serious problem for the
long-range future of the Daily. The stereotypi
cal "gung-ho" reporter is on the way out.
No longer do we find a core of Daily "red
hots" whose priorities are: Daily first, classes
second.
We've made some strides toward alleviating
that problem by putting a senior staffer in
charge of recruiting and training. But the trend
toward a studious, uninvolved student body
could prove calamitous — for the Daily and all
other extracurricular organizations — if not re
versed.
Bonny Rodden takes over as editor for Mon
day's edition. I wish her luck.
To my staff, and to those persons who are so
important to producing each day's issue but
never see their names in the staff box, I say,
"Thanks."
