# DNA research poses tough questions

Halsted Holman

The Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 hearings here
on experimentation with recombinant
DNA have important implications for
relationships between the university
and the surrounding community and
for the practice of science. The hear
ings occur in a context of nationwide
consideration of the health and public
policy issues raised by the emergence
of recombination techniques.
Recombination means combining of
genetic material from organisms of dif
ferent types and studying the effects of
the new genes upon the organisms in
which they are placed and which
thereby become new or "novel" or
ganisms.
Issues which arise include: 1) the
purposes and benefits of the studies; 2)
potential dangers to animal and plant
life from the recombinants; 3) the ef
fectiveness of measures taken to
minimize dangers and monitor
hazards; 4) public representation on
bodies responsible for decisions con
cerning the research; and 5) methods
for determining national priorities for
scientific and technological develop
ment.
Not new issues
The issues raised are not new. They
have been present to some degree
whenever scientific developments
have had an impart on society. How
ever, they are particularly vivid in this
case for at least three reasons. First, the
product of this research is potentially
self-replicating; The reproduction of
harmful microorganisms might not be
stoppable, as the production of a
chemical is.
Second, experiences with modern
technology underscore the need for
caution in modifying the environ
ment. Third, the right of individuals
and communities to know about and
assent to actions which may affect
them as received increasing political
and legal recognition.
(Guidelines from the National Insti
tutes of Health (NIH) govern recom
binant research conducted under fed

eral auspices. However, recombinant
research in industry and elsewhere is
free of regulation. Additional issues
therefore are: 1) a national regulatory
policy applicable to everyone; and 2)
the adequacy of the current NIH
guidelines for that purpose.
Informed consent
Informed consent in medical care
provides a useful context in which to
examine the recombinant issue.
Physicians contemplating diagnostic
procedures or treatments must con
sider the potential outcome for the pa
tient if the action is not taken, the pos
sible benefit to the patient of the ac
tion, alternatives to the contemplated
action and harms which might occur
from the action.
Absolute answers often are not av
ailable. Therefore, weighing of poten
tial benefits and risks must occur and
informed consent of the patient as
sumes great importance. A recent,
unanimous decision of the California
Supreme Court has reversed the histor
ical practice that physicians may de
cide what the patient is to know. Now
physicians must provide the patient
with whatever information is neces
sary to permit the patient to make an
informed decision.
Analogous positions
The modern powers of science and
technology place scientists and re
search institutions in positions
analogous to those of physicians and
medical institutions. Similarly, com
munities are placed in a position com
parable to that of the patient.
The issue then becomes one of
societal consent to activities intended
to benefit the society which bears the
consequences and finances the ac
tivities. A federal research grant,
applied for by an individual scientist,
is actually awarded to the institution
in which the scientist works. Thus, the
scientist and the institution both bear
responsibility for the outcome. These
circumstances require new relation
ships between scientists and their in

stitutions on the one hand and society
on the other.
It has been argued that pure science
is itself free of moral value and there
fore should be free of social regulation.
Social consequences occur only when
that knowledge is put to use. This ar
gument has been invalidated by the
evolution of science.
Passed the stage
Science no longer consists of a few
enterprising individuals describing
and analyzing nature. It has also pas
sed the stage where description of na
ture leads later to social effects, as
atomic physics led to use of nuclear
energy. Today, the quest of knowledge
itself involves social effects as, for
example, in recombination research
where novel, self-replicating or
ganisms are produced as the means of
attaining new knowledge.
Whenever the actions of an indi
vidual or group affect another, moral
issues intrude. Modern science and
mortality have become indissolublv
linked. Thus recombinant research
poses issues as important for the lay
citizen as for the scientist, and the de
bate about recombinant experimenta
tion is defining new relationships be
tween them.
Questions
While large social issues underlie
the forthcoming hearings, the issues
can in part be reduced to specific ques
tions. These include: 1) how real are

the expected benefits and by what al
ternative means can they be achieved;
2) how effective are the safety proce
dures, and how wisely were they cho
sen; 3) how well has pertinent infor
mation been disseminated to the pub
lic, and how can this best be done; 4)
how widespread should recombinant
experimentation become before
adequate information about safety is
gained; 5) how representative are the
bodies which will review performance
as experimentation proceeds, and how
can they best conduct the review; 6)
where does liability reside in the case
of error; 7) what are the appropriate
mechanisms for public participation
in the formulation of science policy at
federal, regional and local levels?
The answers ultimately given to
these and other questions could have
an enormous impact in the well-being
and development of science and of
society. Both could be enriched, or the
relationships between them could be
poisoned. The debate has already pro
duced important views and sugges
tions. In some areas, considerable ag
reement has been achieved; in others
both clarity and consensus are mis
sing.
In consideration of these matters at
Stanford, the views of people from all
segments of the community will be
most valuable.

ical practice that physicians may de
cide what the patient is to know. Now
physicians must provide the patient
with whatever information is neces
sary to permit the patient to make an
informed decision.
Analogous positions
The modern powers of science and
technology place scientists and re
search institutions in positions
analogous to those of physicians and
medical institutions. Similarly, com
munities are placed in a position com
parable to that of the patient.
The issue then becomes one of
societal consent to activities intended
to benefit the society which bears the
consequences and finances the ac
tivities. A federal research grant,
applied for by an individual scientist,
is actually awarded to the institution
in which the scientist works. Thus, the
scientist and the institution both bear
responsibility for the outcome. These
circumstances require new relation
ships between scientists and their in

stitutions on the one hand and society
on the other.
It has been argued that pure science
is itself free of moral value and there
fore should be free of social regulation.
Social consequences occur only when
that knowledge is put to use. This ar
gument has been invalidated by the
evolution of science.
Passed the stage
Science no longer consists of a few
enterprising individuals describing
and analyzing nature. It has also pas
sed the stage where description of na
ture leads later to social effects, as
atomic physics led to use of nuclear
energy. Today, the quest of knowledge
itself involves social effects as, for
example, in recombination research
where novel, self-replicating or
ganisms are produced as the means of
attaining new knowledge.
Whenever the actions of an indi
vidual or group affect another, moral
issues intrude. Modern science and
mortality have become indissolublv
linked. Thus recombinant research
poses issues as important for the lay
citizen as for the scientist, and the de
bate about recombinant experimenta
tion is defining new relationships be
tween them.
Questions
While large social issues underlie
the forthcoming hearings, the issues
can in part be reduced to specific ques
tions. These include: 1) how real are

the expected benefits and by what al
ternative means can they be achieved;
2) how effective are the safety proce
dures, and how wisely were they cho
sen; 3) how well has pertinent infor
mation been disseminated to the pub
lic, and how can this best be done; 4)
how widespread should recombinant
experimentation become before
adequate information about safety is
gained; 5) how representative are the
bodies which will review performance
as experimentation proceeds, and how
can they best conduct the review; 6)
where does liability reside in the case
of error; 7) what are the appropriate
mechanisms for public participation
in the formulation of science policy at
federal, regional and local levels?
The answers ultimately given to
these and other questions could have
an enormous impact in the well-being
and development of science and of
society. Both could be enriched, or the
relationships between them could be
poisoned. The debate has already pro
duced important views and sugges
tions. In some areas, considerable ag
reement has been achieved; in others
both clarity and consensus are mis

In consideration of these matters at
Stanford, the views of people from all
segments of the community will be

The Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 hearings here
on experimentation with recombinant
DNA have important implications for
relationships between the university
and the surrounding community and
for the practice of science. The hear
ings occur in a context of nationwide
consideration of the health and public
policy issues raised by the emergence
of recombination techniques.
Recombination means combining of
genetic material from organisms of dif
ferent types and studying the effects of
the new genes upon the organisms in
which they are placed and which
thereby become new or "novel" or
ganisms.
Issues which arise include: 1) the
purposes and benefits of the studies; 2)
potential dangers to animal and plant
life from the recombinants; 3) the ef
fectiveness of measures taken to
minimize dangers and monitor
hazards; 4) public representation on
bodies responsible for decisions con
cerning the research; and 5) methods
for determining national priorities for
scientific and technological develop
ment.
Not new issues
The issues raised are not new. They
have been present to some degree
whenever scientific developments
have had an impart on society. How
ever, they are particularly vivid in this
case for at least three reasons. First, the
product of this research is potentially
self-replicating; The reproduction of
harmful microorganisms might not be
stoppable, as the production of a
chemical is.
Second, experiences with modern
technology underscore the need for
caution in modifying the environ
ment. Third, the right of individuals
and communities to know about and
assent to actions which may affect
them as received increasing political
and legal recognition.
(Guidelines from the National Insti
tutes of Health (NIH) govern recom
binant research conducted under fed

eral auspices. However, recombinant
research in industry and elsewhere is
free of regulation. Additional issues
therefore are: 1) a national regulatory
policy applicable to everyone; and 2)
the adequacy of the current NIH
guidelines for that purpose.
Informed consent
Informed consent in medical care
provides a useful context in which to
examine the recombinant issue.
Physicians contemplating diagnostic
procedures or treatments must con
sider the potential outcome for the pa
tient if the action is not taken, the pos
sible benefit to the patient of the ac
tion, alternatives to the contemplated
action and harms which might occur
from the action.
Absolute answers often are not av
ailable. Therefore, weighing of poten
tial benefits and risks must occur and
informed consent of the patient as
sumes great importance. A recent,
unanimous decision of the California
Supreme Court has reversed the histor
ical practice that physicians may de
cide what the patient is to know. Now
physicians must provide the patient
with whatever information is neces

The Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 hearings here
on experimentation with recombinant
DNA have important implications for
relationships between the university
and the surrounding community and
for the practice of science. The hear
ings occur in a context of nationwide
consideration of the health and public
policy issues raised by the emergence
of recombination techniques.
Recombination means combining of
genetic material from organisms of dif
ferent types and studying the effects of
the new genes upon the organisms in
which they are placed and which
thereby become new or "novel" or
ganisms.
Issues which arise include: 1) the
purposes and benefits of the studies; 2)
potential dangers to animal and plant
life from the recombinants; 3) the ef
fectiveness of measures taken to
minimize dangers and monitor
hazards; 4) public representation on
bodies responsible for decisions con
cerning the research; and 5) methods
for determining national priorities for
scientific and technological develop
ment.
Not new issues
The issues raised are not new. They
have been present to some degree
whenever scientific developments
have had an impart on society. How
ever, they are particularly vivid in this
case for at least three reasons. First, the
product of this research is potentially
self-replicating; The reproduction of
harmful microorganisms might not be
stoppable, as the production of a
chemical is.
Second, experiences with modern
technology underscore the need for
caution in modifying the environ
ment. Third, the right of individuals
and communities to know about and
assent to actions which may affect
them as received increasing political
and legal recognition.
(Guidelines from the National Insti
tutes of Health (NIH) govern recom
binant research conducted under fed

eral auspices. However, recombinant
research in industry and elsewhere is
free of regulation. Additional issues
therefore are: 1) a national regulatory
policy applicable to everyone; and 2)
the adequacy of the current NIH
guidelines for that purpose.
Informed consent
Informed consent in medical care
provides a useful context in which to
examine the recombinant issue.
Physicians contemplating diagnostic
procedures or treatments must con
sider the potential outcome for the pa
tient if the action is not taken, the pos
sible benefit to the patient of the ac
tion, alternatives to the contemplated
action and harms which might occur
from the action.
Absolute answers often are not av
ailable. Therefore, weighing of poten
tial benefits and risks must occur and
informed consent of the patient as
sumes great importance. A recent,
unanimous decision of the California
Supreme Court has reversed the histor
ical practice that physicians may de
cide what the patient is to know. Now
physicians must provide the patient
with whatever information is neces
sary to permit the patient to make an
informed decision.
Analogous positions
The modern powers of science and
technology place scientists and re
search institutions in positions
analogous to those of physicians and
medical institutions. Similarly, com
munities are placed in a position com
parable to that of the patient.
The issue then becomes one of
societal consent to activities intended
to benefit the society which bears the
consequences and finances the ac
tivities. A federal research grant,
applied for by an individual scientist,
is actually awarded to the institution
in which the scientist works. Thus, the
scientist and the institution both bear
responsibility for the outcome. These
circumstances require new relation
ships between scientists and their in

stitutions on the one hand and society
on the other.
It has been argued that pure science
is itself free of moral value and there
fore should be free of social regulation.
Social consequences occur only when
that knowledge is put to use. This ar
gument has been invalidated by the
evolution of science.
Passed the stage
Science no longer consists of a few
enterprising individuals describing
and analyzing nature. It has also pas
sed the stage where description of na
ture leads later to social effects, as
atomic physics led to use of nuclear
energy. Today, the quest of knowledge
itself involves social effects as, for
example, in recombination research
where novel, self-replicating or
ganisms are produced as the means of
attaining new knowledge.
Whenever the actions of an indi
vidual or group affect another, moral
issues intrude. Modern science and
mortality have become indissolublv
linked. Thus recombinant research
poses issues as important for the lay
citizen as for the scientist, and the de
bate about recombinant experimenta
tion is defining new relationships be
tween them.
Questions
While large social issues underlie
the forthcoming hearings, the issues
can in part be reduced to specific ques
tions. These include: 1) how real are

the expected benefits and by what al
ternative means can they be achieved;
2) how effective are the safety proce
dures, and how wisely were they cho
sen; 3) how well has pertinent infor
mation been disseminated to the pub
lic, and how can this best be done; 4)
how widespread should recombinant
experimentation become before
adequate information about safety is
gained; 5) how representative are the
bodies which will review performance
as experimentation proceeds, and how
can they best conduct the review; 6)
where does liability reside in the case
of error; 7) what are the appropriate
mechanisms for public participation
in the formulation of science policy at
federal, regional and local levels?
The answers ultimately given to
these and other questions could have
an enormous impact in the well-being
and development of science and of
