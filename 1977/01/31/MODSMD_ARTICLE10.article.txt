# University should retain Cliveden
## 
### 
Jim Knox

I assume that the Daily's Jan. 19
editorial on overseas campuses was
prompted by the opinion submitted by
Robert Smith on behalf of the Save
Cliveden Committee and printed in
the Daily on Jan. 18.
If this is the case, I am surprised that
the Daily did not respond to any of the
points made in that opinion. If any
thing the Daily has the dubious dis
tinction of being successfully rebutted
before even printing its own shallow
remarks.
First, to set the record straight, the
issue at stake is not the relocation of
the British overseas campus. There
had been talk of a possible move to
London or Oxford. But London has
been determined to be prohibitively
expensive.
No move to Oxford is likely in the
near future because of a lack of fi
nances and facilities. The question for
the present is whether Stanford will
have an overseas campus at Cliveden
or no British campus at all.
Other arrangements
The Daily's editorial board seems to
feel that because of a common lan
guage and a similar culture, Stanford
does not need an overseas campus in
Britain. It feels that arrangements
should be madefor students to study at
English universities on an individual
exchange basis.
This ignores many basic obstacles
which I will discuss later. But more
importantly the proposed weakening
of the British program seems a back

handed implication that Britain is not
a worthy location for any overseas
studies at all, or at least not as worthy
as other locations. This feeble notion
must be attacked first.
The logic seems to go something 1 ike
this — the greater the culture differ
ence of the overseas study location, the
more rewarding and beneficial the ex
perience will be. If this is the case, why
don't we establish overseas centers in
Zaire and the Amazon jungle? The
reason is obvious — cultural differ
ence, in and of itself, is valueless.
Benefits
One of the most valuable benefits to
be derived from living in a foreign cul
ture is that it enables one to gain valu
able insights into his own. And this
can be achieved in Britain perhaps bet
ter than anywhere else.
For in Britain the roots of our coun
try lie. From Britain we have inherited
our literary, political and social herit
age. To become acquainted with Bri
tain is to delve into the history of the
United States. To learn her customs
and ideas is to begin to understand the
forces which helped mold our country.
And while we share our heritage
with Britain, the frequently voiced
opinion that Britain is not a foreign
country, but rather more like a 51st
state is totally ludicrous, as anyone
who has gotten a ride with a Scottish
lorry driver, spoken to a Welsh fisher
man, tasted the horrendous British
cuisine, read the Manchester Guar
dian, or attended a cricket or football

(soccer to us foreigners) match will
certainly affirm.
Denial
Even some who acknowledge the
value of study in Britain question the
wisdom of locating a special Stanford
facility there. But it seems obvious to
me that if Stanford were to abandon
our British campus it would be acting
only to deny a vast number of students
the opportunity to study overseas.
Even if Stanford could arrange an
exchange system with one or more En
glish universities, and that is a very
optimistic assumption, how many
places could we hope to secure? 10?
15?
And what if students were forced to
make their own arrangements? That
would mean hassling over transporta
tion, accommodations, scheduling
and transferral of credit. How many of
us could ever hope to overcome these
difficulties? In neither situation could
the number ever approach 230, which
is how many Stanford students study
in Britain each year.
Lone opportunity
Another fact lost on many people is
that for a great number of students Bri
tain represents the only opportunity to
participate on the overseas program.
Many Stanford students do not speak
French, Italian or German. Can these
people justifiably be denied the
chance to study overseas? Further
more, Britain is the ideal place for En
glish and history majors to study on
their chosen fields.
The Daily's proposal to eliminate a

Stanford facility in Britain also ignores
the benefits of the unjustifiably
maligned "group experience." Stu
dents enjoy the Cliveden program, but
that fact is usually seen in a negative
!i g ht , , 2
However, at Cliveden close personal
contact with Stanford faculty is much
easier to find than it is in Caiiforiya.
And the common bond of shared ex
perience produces close relationships
among the students. Together these
can provoke great personal and educa
tional growth that would surely be ab
sent without the group atmosphere.
Most qualified
Finally, I hope that the wishes of the
students have some impact on this is
sue. Perhaps those most qualified to
speak on the value of a Stanford over
seas campus in Britain are those who
have been to Cliveden. And there is no
doubt in my mind that the overwhelm
ing majority favor its retention.
Traditionally there are more applic
ants to Britain than to any other over
seas campus. This alone is a strong
argument for its retention. The British
program is also one of the most
economical.
Does it make sense to dismantle the
strongest of the overseas programs?
Apparently the Daily thinks so, but I
do not. And furthermore. I find it a sad
situation when the student newspaper
speaks out contrary to the wishes of so
many students, when it should instead
be advocating their cause.

speak on the value of a Stanford over
seas campus in Britain are those who
have been to Cliveden. And there is no
doubt in my mind that the overwhelm

Traditionally there are more applic

argument for its retention. The British

Does it make sense to dismantle the

Apparently the Daily thinks so, but I
do not. And furthermore. I find it a sad
situation when the student newspaper
speaks out contrary to the wishes of so
many students, when it should instead
be advocating their cause.

I assume that the Daily's Jan. 19
editorial on overseas campuses was
prompted by the opinion submitted by
Robert Smith on behalf of the Save
Cliveden Committee and printed in
the Daily on Jan. 18.
If this is the case, I am surprised that
the Daily did not respond to any of the
points made in that opinion. If any
thing the Daily has the dubious dis
tinction of being successfully rebutted
before even printing its own shallow
remarks.
First, to set the record straight, the
issue at stake is not the relocation of
the British overseas campus. There
had been talk of a possible move to
London or Oxford. But London has
been determined to be prohibitively
expensive.
No move to Oxford is likely in the
near future because of a lack of fi
nances and facilities. The question for
the present is whether Stanford will
have an overseas campus at Cliveden
or no British campus at all.
Other arrangements
The Daily's editorial board seems to
feel that because of a common lan
guage and a similar culture, Stanford
does not need an overseas campus in
Britain. It feels that arrangements
should be madefor students to study at
English universities on an individual
exchange basis.
This ignores many basic obstacles
which I will discuss later. But more
importantly the proposed weakening
of the British program seems a back

handed implication that Britain is not
a worthy location for any overseas
studies at all, or at least not as worthy
as other locations. This feeble notion
must be attacked first.
The logic seems to go something 1 ike
this — the greater the culture differ
ence of the overseas study location, the
more rewarding and beneficial the ex
perience will be. If this is the case, why
don't we establish overseas centers in
Zaire and the Amazon jungle? The
reason is obvious — cultural differ
ence, in and of itself, is valueless.
Benefits
One of the most valuable benefits to
be derived from living in a foreign cul
ture is that it enables one to gain valu
able insights into his own. And this
can be achieved in Britain perhaps bet
ter than anywhere else.
For in Britain the roots of our coun
try lie. From Britain we have inherited
our literary, political and social herit
age. To become acquainted with Bri
tain is to delve into the history of the
United States. To learn her customs
and ideas is to begin to understand the
forces which helped mold our country.
And while we share our heritage
with Britain, the frequently voiced
opinion that Britain is not a foreign
country, but rather more like a 51st
state is totally ludicrous, as anyone
who has gotten a ride with a Scottish
lorry driver, spoken to a Welsh fisher
man, tasted the horrendous British
cuisine, read the Manchester Guar
dian, or attended a cricket or football

(soccer to us foreigners) match will
certainly affirm.
Denial
Even some who acknowledge the
value of study in Britain question the
wisdom of locating a special Stanford
facility there. But it seems obvious to
me that if Stanford were to abandon
our British campus it would be acting
only to deny a vast number of students
the opportunity to study overseas.
Even if Stanford could arrange an
exchange system with one or more En
glish universities, and that is a very
optimistic assumption, how many
places could we hope to secure? 10?
15?
And what if students were forced to
make their own arrangements? That
would mean hassling over transporta
tion, accommodations, scheduling
and transferral of credit. How many of
us could ever hope to overcome these
difficulties? In neither situation could
the number ever approach 230, which
is how many Stanford students study
in Britain each year.
Lone opportunity
Another fact lost on many people is
that for a great number of students Bri
tain represents the only opportunity to
participate on the overseas program.
Many Stanford students do not speak
French, Italian or German. Can these
people justifiably be denied the
chance to study overseas? Further
more, Britain is the ideal place for En
glish and history majors to study on
their chosen fields.
The Daily's proposal to eliminate a

Stanford facility in Britain also ignores
the benefits of the unjustifiably
maligned "group experience." Stu
dents enjoy the Cliveden program, but
that fact is usually seen in a negative
!i g ht , , 2
However, at Cliveden close personal
contact with Stanford faculty is much
easier to find than it is in Caiiforiya.

make their own arrangements? That
would mean hassling over transporta
tion, accommodations, scheduling
and transferral of credit. How many of
us could ever hope to overcome these
difficulties? In neither situation could
the number ever approach 230, which
is how many Stanford students study
in Britain each year.
Lone opportunity
Another fact lost on many people is
that for a great number of students Bri
tain represents the only opportunity to
participate on the overseas program.
Many Stanford students do not speak
French, Italian or German. Can these
people justifiably be denied the
chance to study overseas? Further
more, Britain is the ideal place for En
glish and history majors to study on
their chosen fields.
The Daily's proposal to eliminate a

Stanford facility in Britain also ignores
the benefits of the unjustifiably
maligned "group experience." Stu
dents enjoy the Cliveden program, but
that fact is usually seen in a negative
!i g ht , , 2
However, at Cliveden close personal
contact with Stanford faculty is much
easier to find than it is in Caiiforiya.
And the common bond of shared ex
perience produces close relationships
among the students. Together these
can provoke great personal and educa
tional growth that would surely be ab
sent without the group atmosphere.
Most qualified
Finally, I hope that the wishes of the
students have some impact on this is
sue. Perhaps those most qualified to
speak on the value of a Stanford over
seas campus in Britain are those who
have been to Cliveden. And there is no
doubt in my mind that the overwhelm
ing majority favor its retention.
Traditionally there are more applic
ants to Britain than to any other over
seas campus. This alone is a strong
argument for its retention. The British
program is also one of the most
economical.
Does it make sense to dismantle the
strongest of the overseas programs?
Apparently the Daily thinks so, but I
do not. And furthermore. I find it a sad
situation when the student newspaper
speaks out contrary to the wishes of so
many students, when it should instead
be advocating their cause.

I assume that the Daily's Jan. 19
editorial on overseas campuses was
prompted by the opinion submitted by
Robert Smith on behalf of the Save
Cliveden Committee and printed in
the Daily on Jan. 18.
If this is the case, I am surprised that
the Daily did not respond to any of the
points made in that opinion. If any
thing the Daily has the dubious dis
tinction of being successfully rebutted
before even printing its own shallow
remarks.
First, to set the record straight, the
issue at stake is not the relocation of
the British overseas campus. There
had been talk of a possible move to
London or Oxford. But London has
been determined to be prohibitively
expensive.
No move to Oxford is likely in the
near future because of a lack of fi
nances and facilities. The question for
the present is whether Stanford will
have an overseas campus at Cliveden
or no British campus at all.
Other arrangements
The Daily's editorial board seems to
feel that because of a common lan
guage and a similar culture, Stanford
does not need an overseas campus in
Britain. It feels that arrangements
should be madefor students to study at
English universities on an individual
exchange basis.
This ignores many basic obstacles
which I will discuss later. But more
importantly the proposed weakening
of the British program seems a back

handed implication that Britain is not
a worthy location for any overseas
studies at all, or at least not as worthy
as other locations. This feeble notion
must be attacked first.
The logic seems to go something 1 ike
this — the greater the culture differ
ence of the overseas study location, the
more rewarding and beneficial the ex
perience will be. If this is the case, why
don't we establish overseas centers in
Zaire and the Amazon jungle? The
reason is obvious — cultural differ
ence, in and of itself, is valueless.
Benefits
One of the most valuable benefits to
be derived from living in a foreign cul
ture is that it enables one to gain valu
able insights into his own. And this
can be achieved in Britain perhaps bet
ter than anywhere else.
For in Britain the roots of our coun
try lie. From Britain we have inherited
our literary, political and social herit
age. To become acquainted with Bri
tain is to delve into the history of the
United States. To learn her customs
and ideas is to begin to understand the
forces which helped mold our country.
And while we share our heritage
with Britain, the frequently voiced
opinion that Britain is not a foreign
country, but rather more like a 51st
state is totally ludicrous, as anyone
who has gotten a ride with a Scottish
lorry driver, spoken to a Welsh fisher
man, tasted the horrendous British
cuisine, read the Manchester Guar
dian, or attended a cricket or football

(soccer to us foreigners) match will
certainly affirm.
Denial
Even some who acknowledge the
value of study in Britain question the
wisdom of locating a special Stanford
facility there. But it seems obvious to
me that if Stanford were to abandon
our British campus it would be acting
only to deny a vast number of students
the opportunity to study overseas.
Even if Stanford could arrange an
exchange system with one or more En
glish universities, and that is a very
optimistic assumption, how many
places could we hope to secure? 10?
15?
And what if students were forced to
make their own arrangements? That
would mean hassling over transporta
tion, accommodations, scheduling
and transferral of credit. How many of
