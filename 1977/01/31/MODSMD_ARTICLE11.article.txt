# So, your dorm wants to put on a musical
## 
### Carlin Chrisman 
Grease ended a .successful
four-day run before a packed
house at Cedro Hull lust night.
The players uppeared to enjoy
the prduction almost as much as
those who watched. But the final
product belied the long hours of
work, the fiustrations and dis
ruptions which occur in a dorm
when a play is produced.

The deepset eyes made him
look a little like James Dean. So
did his sleeveless T-shirt. His
blue jeans were rolled up over
his ankles and grease dripped oft
his slicked-back hair. It shone
under the harsh lights of the
washroom.
An equally tough-looking
character strolled through the
door and proceeded to give the
pseudo-Dean's face a thorough
working over — with an eyeliner
and some make-up.
Beside them, a sophomore was
metamorphosed into a frumpy
high school English teacher. The
stereotype was complete down
to the requisite horn-rimmed
glasses and graying hair.
Out in the lounge, some
people were putting last-second
touches on a large blue backdrop
while the dining room, 2000
miles off Broadway, had evolved
into a stage.
Grease had arrived at Stan

ford. Hail Teen Angel and bee
bop-a-100-bam-bam (my baby).
And changes had come to the
Wilbur dormitory complex as
the steady throb ol rock and roll
heralded Cedro Hall's first d ress
rehearsal of the popular Broad
way musical: While dorm plays
involve a goodly number of hall
residents, they also tend to dis
rupt normal living patterns.
Lounges become work areas,
schedules start revolving around
ehearsals and the danger of
tripping over electrical wiring is
increased tenfold. But some
times frustration builds within
the dorm.
About 90 people live in Cedro
and maybe half are involved in
Grease. Those working on the
musical said it seemed to have a
positive effect on Cedro. "It's re
ally brought people together,"
said Janice Cohn, who played
one of the leading roles. "1 think
the dorm is much closer now
than when we started."
But others weren't so sure.
Steve Schiller is Cedro's house
manager. He said that if Grease
had brought a new unity to the
dorm, he was not aware of it.
"There was a lot of division in
the beginning," he said. "Some
people didn't like the play —
they thought it was lewd and
had no redeeming value. There

was a petition to change it. Then
there were problems with the
budget."
Some dorm residents wanted
to limit the musical's funding to
$75. The director and producer
wanted $150.
"The acrimony generated by
decision-making has been a
source of frustration to me,"
Schiller said. But then he added,
"1 know I'm in the minority.
Most of the others are very en
thusiastic. ... I guess I'll just
wait and see if the effort was
worth it."
Brend Shaphren, director of
the musical, said talk about
dorm unity is "just a crock. The
best thing about the play is that it
gives people who are interested
in the theatre a chance to do
things they couldn't in the Stan
ford drama department. The
ones who are really involved are
the ones who get something out
of it."
Shaphren's view was sup
ported, offhandedly, by Carlos

Hernandez, a Cedroite who is
not in Crease. "I feel kind of left
out because I'm not in the play. I
have a job in the city on
weekends so 1 couldn't try out."
Hernandez said he tried to
help out by carrying cables when
he could find time.
"1 think there's some division
between the people in the play
and those who aren't." Hernan
dez added. "A few people, even
some of the cast, were bad
mouthing the play at first . . . 1
can't say how other people in the
dorm feel about the play. The
only ones you see are the cast
and crew members. Most of the
others are out studying.
"The guys across the hall are
at the library as usual — I don't
think I've ever heard them talk
about it."he said.
But dorm plays have enjoyed a
fair amount of success in past
years. If "the effort" was mea
sured solely in terms of audi
ence, then Cedro's production of
Grease was a smash. It was

"standing room only" for the
performances.
People who were taking part
in the musical did not necessar
ily measure success in those
terms. "Working with someone
is the best way to get to know
them," Mary Bateson said She
has just recently moved away
from Cedrobut comes back regu
larly for rehearsals. "You can't
form real friendships just eating
with people or seeing them
around."
And Todd Perkins, who was in
charge of sound production, ag
reed. "If nothing else, I've gotten
to know a couple of people bet
ter. 1 really think we'll feel some
thing for each other when it's
over. Even people who aren't in
it benefit, because it gives the
dorm a sense of identity. People
from other dorms drop by to see
how it's coming along."
It kind of gives you a sense of
fellowship to know that
everyone else's studies are going
to hell."
