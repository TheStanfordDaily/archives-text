### David Georgette 
The UCLA Bruins showed this weekend
why they are tlie class of Pac.ific-8 basketball
as they collected two more victories to up
their overall record to 16-2.
Yesterday sophomore guard Kay Hamil
ton hit for 30 points as the Bruins defeated
Tennessee, 103-89, in Atlanta.
UCLA was red-hot from the field in the
first half and led 52-42 at the half. The Vol
unteers closed to within four in the first few
minutes of the second half, but three
straight baskets by sophomore David
Greenwood built up the Br.uins' lead which
they maintained the rest of the game.
Dynamic duo
The Vols' dynamic duo of Bernie King
and Ernie Grunfeld combined for 54 points,
with King scoring a game-high 31 points.
Greenwood canned 24 and Marques
Johnson had 25 for the Bruins.
Friday night Johnson had destroyed USC
at Pauley Pavilion with 26 points, including
five slam dunks, and grabbed 15 rebounds
as UCLA triumphed, 77-50.
Greenwood added 17 forthe Bruins while
Greg White, who had been sidelined with a
foot stress fracture, led the Trojans with 17

points.
Before the game, the Bruin fans had
counted to 20, and they got their wish as the
defeat was the Trojans' 20th straight confer
ence loss.
The Bruin backers taunted USC's coach
Bob Boyd at the end of the game, calling for
Mark Wulfemever, the former Trojan guard
who quit the team a few days ago.
In the other conference match-up of the
weekend, Washington (13-5) jumped off toa
big lead in Pullman and then held off two
late surges by Washington State to win
71-68, and remain tied with the Bruins for
the conference lead with a 4-1 mark.
Kim Stewart topped the Huskies with 21
points. The loss dropped WSII to 3-2 in the
conference.
Road losses
The Oregon schools had a rough time on
the road. Friday night the Beavers fell 55-51
to the Seattle Chieftains. Oregon State (11 -9)
led 51-46 with less than five minutes to
play, but they failed to score a point the rest
of the way.
Trailing 52-51 with two minutes togo, the
Beavers played for the last shot, but George
Tucker missed a baseline jumper with 10

seconds to go. Seattle insured its victory
with three free throws.
Glen Williams scored 22 points for St.
John's as the Redman beat the Oregon
Ducks, 61-51. The Ducks are now 12-7.
