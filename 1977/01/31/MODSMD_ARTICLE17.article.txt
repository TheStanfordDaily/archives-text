# Utah State mauls Cardinals
## 
### Rich Domich Gary Cohen 
The Utah State Aggies are not
known as the best of hosts.
About once a week throughout
the winter they invite 7000-
10,000 friends over for a party i°
which the sole source of enter
tainment is the embarrassment
of a dozen unsuspecting stran
gers
Of the past 50 parties, 44 have
been successful. Diane von
Farstenberger couldn't have
thrown a better feast than Satur
day night's.
Utah State's friends witnessed
Stanford's biggest loss of the
season, 103-84. From the Cardi
nals' perspective, the game
could best be termed sub-par.
The contest was fast paced
from the start, with Stanford fal
ling behind by 10 in the early
going, but coming up with a 20-9
spurt to take the lead at 32-31.
Foul trouble
The Cards were still leading
36-35 when freshman forward
Tom Schmalzried picked up his
third foul. Kimberly Belton had
already heard his third whistle,
so the Cards had to go the re
mainder of the first half without
two of their best rebounders.
Center Jeff McHugh did a good
job on the boards (11 rebounds),
but Stanford trailed 46-40 at the
intermission.
Utah State opened the second
stanza with a 30-17 burst that
virtually ended the game. Stan
ford's depleted forecourt al
lowed Utah State's front line to
score 81 points.
Poor defense
Eventually, Belton, Schmal
zried and substitute Dick

Dohrmann all fouled out.
Throughout the second half, the
Aggies penetrated the Stanford
zone for lay-ins and short jum
pers. As Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso said later, "we did not play
good defense."
The loss brings the Cardinal
season record to 9-8. Stanford
now plays 10 Pacific-8 contests.
Although the Cards went 0-2
on the road, there were some
bright spots for Stanford.
Paul Giovacchini played very
well running the offense, while
Mike Bratz worked without the
ball. Jeff McHugh had a great
performance after missing the
Air Force game with an ankle in
jury. And as always there was
Dißiaso.

The second-year coach usu
ally gets the most from all of his
players home or away, healthy or
not. Of the team's six top players
at the start of the season, only
two really played against Air
Force, and three at Utah State.
Coaches all around the coun
try have marveled at DiBiaso's
ability to "get the most from his
team." Despite a seventh place
finish last year. DiBiaso was co-
Coach of the Year in the confer
ence.
As Utah State coach Dutch
Belnap said after the game, "I'd
hate to have to play him every
day for a living. "That's probably
about the way Stanford feels
about Utah State.

The Utah State Aggies are not
known as the best of hosts.
About once a week throughout
the winter they invite 7000-
10,000 friends over for a party i°
which the sole source of enter
tainment is the embarrassment
of a dozen unsuspecting stran
gers
Of the past 50 parties, 44 have
been successful. Diane von
Farstenberger couldn't have
thrown a better feast than Satur
day night's.
Utah State's friends witnessed
Stanford's biggest loss of the
season, 103-84. From the Cardi
nals' perspective, the game
could best be termed sub-par.
The contest was fast paced
from the start, with Stanford fal
ling behind by 10 in the early
going, but coming up with a 20-9
spurt to take the lead at 32-31.
Foul trouble
The Cards were still leading
36-35 when freshman forward
Tom Schmalzried picked up his
third foul. Kimberly Belton had
already heard his third whistle,
so the Cards had to go the re
mainder of the first half without
two of their best rebounders.
Center Jeff McHugh did a good
job on the boards (11 rebounds),
but Stanford trailed 46-40 at the
intermission.
Utah State opened the second
stanza with a 30-17 burst that
virtually ended the game. Stan
ford's depleted forecourt al
lowed Utah State's front line to
score 81 points.
Poor defense
Eventually, Belton, Schmal
zried and substitute Dick

Dohrmann all fouled out.
Throughout the second half, the
Aggies penetrated the Stanford
zone for lay-ins and short jum
pers. As Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso said later, "we did not play
good defense."
The loss brings the Cardinal
season record to 9-8. Stanford
now plays 10 Pacific-8 contests.
Although the Cards went 0-2
on the road, there were some
bright spots for Stanford.
Paul Giovacchini played very
well running the offense, while
Mike Bratz worked without the
ball. Jeff McHugh had a great
performance after missing the
Air Force game with an ankle in
jury. And as always there was
Dißiaso.

The second-year coach usu
ally gets the most from all of his
players home or away, healthy or
not. Of the team's six top players
at the start of the season, only
two really played against Air
Force, and three at Utah State.
Coaches all around the coun
try have marveled at DiBiaso's
ability to "get the most from his
team." Despite a seventh place
finish last year. DiBiaso was co-
Coach of the Year in the confer
ence.
As Utah State coach Dutch
Belnap said after the game, "I'd
hate to have to play him every
day for a living. "That's probably
about the way Stanford feels
about Utah State.

Poor defense
Eventually, Belton, Schmal
zried and substitute Dick

Dohrmann all fouled out.
Throughout the second half, the
Aggies penetrated the Stanford
zone for lay-ins and short jum
pers. As Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso said later, "we did not play
good defense."
The loss brings the Cardinal
season record to 9-8. Stanford
now plays 10 Pacific-8 contests.
Although the Cards went 0-2
on the road, there were some
bright spots for Stanford.
Paul Giovacchini played very
well running the offense, while
Mike Bratz worked without the
ball. Jeff McHugh had a great
performance after missing the
Air Force game with an ankle in
jury. And as always there was
Dißiaso.

The second-year coach usu
ally gets the most from all of his
players home or away, healthy or
not. Of the team's six top players
at the start of the season, only
two really played against Air
Force, and three at Utah State.
Coaches all around the coun
try have marveled at DiBiaso's
ability to "get the most from his
team." Despite a seventh place
finish last year. DiBiaso was co-
Coach of the Year in the confer
ence.
As Utah State coach Dutch
Belnap said after the game, "I'd
hate to have to play him every
day for a living. "That's probably
about the way Stanford feels
about Utah State.
