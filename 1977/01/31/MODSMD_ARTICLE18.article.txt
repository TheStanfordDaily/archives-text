# Feminine intuition
## Farewell to swimming 
### Jill Lieber 
Sports writing is probably the
most personal form of jour
nalism. In today's sports cover
age — be it journalism or broad
casting — the fans want "up
close and personal" features.
They want to see their heroes in
the locker room following a
major victory. They want to
know what an athlete feels like
as he crosses the finish line in
the Olympic marathon.
1 have never had problems in
getting anyone to talk — male
athletes especially. Phyllis
George said one time that
athletes aren't as open to male
sports writers because they see
the male sportswriter idolizing
them — wishing he too were a
part of the team. But female
sportswriters pose no threats
like that. They lend a sympathe
tic ear.
But this quarter, instead of re
lying on whatever part of my
personality that had caused
athletes to open up in inter
views, I decided to become "one
of thegang." Before swim season
even started I knew a lot of
people on the team because of a
class 1 took in the fall — "Swim
ming Theory and Technique."
Ah, 1 thought, my friends will
tell me what's going on behind
the scenes.
However, there comes a time
in a journalist's career when a
line must be drawn between
friend and journalist. That be
came clearly evident to myself as
well as the swim team and prob
ably anyone who follows the
Daily sports pages.
Wednesday Jan. 12 an article
appeared in the Daily on Sandy
Mac Donald, a butterflier whose
strong motivation and desire 1
admire immensely. I wrote about
Sandy as a guy who may never
set world records but whose de

termination and hard work make
those who do set records envy
him.
After the article was printed I
got numerous cold stares from
the team and finally, in a letter to
the editor, it was explained just
what caused the upset. I had
made Sandy look like a team
mascot, the letter implied.
Then, exactly one week later 1
wrote an article on Mike Bruner.
The article raised a lot of eye
brows and was heavily criticized
among students as well as the
team. Even one of my best
friends who is also a swimmer,
Kevin Reel, said, "How could
you print that personal stuff?''
"Mike said it to me," 1 replied.
"He knew the tape recorder was
on."
Looking back at the night
Bruner and 1 talked, 1 realized
that a lot of what he said to me —
that he was bummed out about
an old girlfriend, that he was in
secure out of the water and that
he was fighting to break out of
his image as being obnoxious —
all were told to me as a friend

rather than as a journalist.
Now he won't speak to me and
I am uncomfortable around the
rest of the team. Writing sports,
be it for the Daily or the Son
Francisco Chronicle, is not worth
the pain of losing friends.
Up to this point I've had a lot
of fun. I've met some great
people. I've eaten breakfast with
Johnny Bench, spent the after
noon at poolside with Franklin
Mieuli, owner of the Warriors,
watched Monday night football
with many Stanford football
players, and looked at Mike
Bruner's Olympic gold medals
as well as the slides he took of
the Games.
I've met these athletes as
people and written about them
as people. I enjoy the psychology
of sports and believe readers do
too. But after the criticism the
past few weeks I've started won
dering if people wouldn't rather
read features that contain statis
tics and sugary quotes from
coaches.

And it was hard to criticize the
coaches who didn't permit a
top-notch sprinter compete
Saturday because he hadn't been
regularly attending morning
workouts.
To nip the problem in the bud I
will no longer be covering
swimming. As Leonard Koppett
of the New York Times told me,
"It's not worth covering a team if
it affects you personally."
There is no other writer on the
Daily staff who enjoys swim

ten too close to the members on
the team. Neither they nor I can
separate friendship from busi
ness.

termination and hard work make
those who do set records envy
him.
After the article was printed I
got numerous cold stares from
the team and finally, in a letter to
the editor, it was explained just
what caused the upset. I had
made Sandy look like a team
mascot, the letter implied.
Then, exactly one week later 1
wrote an article on Mike Bruner.
The article raised a lot of eye
brows and was heavily criticized
among students as well as the
team. Even one of my best
friends who is also a swimmer,
Kevin Reel, said, "How could
you print that personal stuff?''
"Mike said it to me," 1 replied.
"He knew the tape recorder was
on."
Looking back at the night
Bruner and 1 talked, 1 realized
that a lot of what he said to me —
that he was bummed out about
an old girlfriend, that he was in
secure out of the water and that
he was fighting to break out of
his image as being obnoxious —
all were told to me as a friend

rather than as a journalist.
Now he won't speak to me and
I am uncomfortable around the
rest of the team. Writing sports,
be it for the Daily or the Son
Francisco Chronicle, is not worth
the pain of losing friends.
Up to this point I've had a lot
of fun. I've met some great
people. I've eaten breakfast with
Johnny Bench, spent the after
noon at poolside with Franklin
Mieuli, owner of the Warriors,
watched Monday night football
with many Stanford football
players, and looked at Mike
Bruner's Olympic gold medals
as well as the slides he took of
the Games.
I've met these athletes as
people and written about them
as people. I enjoy the psychology
of sports and believe readers do
too. But after the criticism the
past few weeks I've started won
dering if people wouldn't rather
read features that contain statis
tics and sugary quotes from
coaches.

typewriter and found it difficult
to write an article on Saturday's
swim meet against Arden Hills
and UO!\ I couldn't bring myself
to criticize anyone on the team.
1 couldn't let their complaints
about tough workouts go into
print.
1 couldn't directly quote a
friend who told me — as a friend
— "The only fun I'm having is
when I get in bed at 11 o'clock."
And it was hard to criticize the
coaches who didn't permit a
top-notch sprinter compete
Saturday because he hadn't been
regularly attending morning
workouts.
To nip the problem in the bud I
will no longer be covering
swimming. As Leonard Koppett
of the New York Times told me,
"It's not worth covering a team if
it affects you personally."
There is no other writer on the
Daily staff who enjoys swim
ming more than I. Hut I have got
ten too close to the members on
the team. Neither they nor I can
separate friendship from busi
ness.
Sports writing is probably the
most personal form of jour
nalism. In today's sports cover
age — be it journalism or broad
casting — the fans want "up
close and personal" features.
They want to see their heroes in
the locker room following a
major victory. They want to
know what an athlete feels like
as he crosses the finish line in
the Olympic marathon.
1 have never had problems in
getting anyone to talk — male
athletes especially. Phyllis
George said one time that
athletes aren't as open to male
sports writers because they see
the male sportswriter idolizing
them — wishing he too were a
part of the team. But female
sportswriters pose no threats
like that. They lend a sympathe
tic ear.
But this quarter, instead of re
lying on whatever part of my
personality that had caused
athletes to open up in inter
views, I decided to become "one
of thegang." Before swim season
even started I knew a lot of
people on the team because of a
class 1 took in the fall — "Swim
ming Theory and Technique."
Ah, 1 thought, my friends will
tell me what's going on behind
the scenes.
However, there comes a time
in a journalist's career when a
line must be drawn between
friend and journalist. That be
came clearly evident to myself as

ably anyone who follows the

typewriter and found it difficult
to write an article on Saturday's
swim meet against Arden Hills
and UO!\ I couldn't bring myself
to criticize anyone on the team.
1 couldn't let their complaints
about tough workouts go into
print.
1 couldn't directly quote a
friend who told me — as a friend
— "The only fun I'm having is
when I get in bed at 11 o'clock."
And it was hard to criticize the
coaches who didn't permit a
top-notch sprinter compete
Saturday because he hadn't been
regularly attending morning
workouts.
To nip the problem in the bud I
will no longer be covering
swimming. As Leonard Koppett
of the New York Times told me,
"It's not worth covering a team if
it affects you personally."
There is no other writer on the
Daily staff who enjoys swim
ming more than I. Hut I have got
ten too close to the members on
the team. Neither they nor I can
separate friendship from busi
ness.
Sports writing is probably the
most personal form of jour
nalism. In today's sports cover
age — be it journalism or broad
casting — the fans want "up
close and personal" features.
They want to see their heroes in
the locker room following a
major victory. They want to
know what an athlete feels like
as he crosses the finish line in
the Olympic marathon.
1 have never had problems in
getting anyone to talk — male
athletes especially. Phyllis
George said one time that
athletes aren't as open to male
sports writers because they see
the male sportswriter idolizing
them — wishing he too were a
part of the team. But female
sportswriters pose no threats
like that. They lend a sympathe
tic ear.
But this quarter, instead of re
lying on whatever part of my
personality that had caused
athletes to open up in inter
views, I decided to become "one
of thegang." Before swim season
even started I knew a lot of
people on the team because of a
class 1 took in the fall — "Swim
ming Theory and Technique."
Ah, 1 thought, my friends will
tell me what's going on behind
the scenes.
However, there comes a time
in a journalist's career when a
line must be drawn between
friend and journalist. That be
came clearly evident to myself as
well as the swim team and prob
ably anyone who follows the
Daily sports pages.
Wednesday Jan. 12 an article
appeared in the Daily on Sandy
Mac Donald, a butterflier whose
strong motivation and desire 1
admire immensely. I wrote about
Sandy as a guy who may never
set world records but whose de

termination and hard work make
those who do set records envy
him.
After the article was printed I
got numerous cold stares from
the team and finally, in a letter to
the editor, it was explained just
what caused the upset. I had
made Sandy look like a team
mascot, the letter implied.
Then, exactly one week later 1
wrote an article on Mike Bruner.
The article raised a lot of eye
brows and was heavily criticized
among students as well as the
team. Even one of my best
friends who is also a swimmer,
Kevin Reel, said, "How could
you print that personal stuff?''
"Mike said it to me," 1 replied.
"He knew the tape recorder was
on."
Looking back at the night
Bruner and 1 talked, 1 realized
that a lot of what he said to me —
that he was bummed out about
an old girlfriend, that he was in
secure out of the water and that
he was fighting to break out of
his image as being obnoxious —
all were told to me as a friend

rather than as a journalist.
Now he won't speak to me and
I am uncomfortable around the
rest of the team. Writing sports,
be it for the Daily or the Son
Francisco Chronicle, is not worth
the pain of losing friends.
Up to this point I've had a lot
of fun. I've met some great
people. I've eaten breakfast with
Johnny Bench, spent the after
noon at poolside with Franklin
Mieuli, owner of the Warriors,
watched Monday night football
with many Stanford football
players, and looked at Mike
Bruner's Olympic gold medals
as well as the slides he took of
the Games.
