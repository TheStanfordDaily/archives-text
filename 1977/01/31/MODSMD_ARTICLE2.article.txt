# Recombinant DNA research: will we get magic or mutants?
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Arthur Clarke, a noted science fic
tion writer and author of 2001 and
Childhood's End, likes to say that "any
sufficiently developed technology is
indistinguishable from magic."
The magic that Mickey Mouse tried
to use as the sorceror's apprentice to
lighten his work load and improve his
environment got out of control with
devastating effect.
Now, as the 20th century (during
which science bestowed on humanity
hydrogen bombs, thalidomide,
polyvinyl chloride and television) en
ters its final quarter, a controversy has
arisen about whether certain experi
ments in genetic manipulation, so as
tounding as to be almost magical,
ought to be carried out because they
can be and because some scientists
have promised wholesale benefits
from them.
These experiments in genetic man
ipulation, or recombinant DNA re
search, will be the subject of two pub
lic meetings, open to all, to be held
tonight and tomorrow night in the new
Sherman Fairchild Center Auditorium
at the Medical Center at 8.
Tonight
Tonight's meeting will feature re
marks by David Hogness, professor of
biochemistry and co-author of the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH)
guidelines now regulating recombin
ant DNA research, on the nature of this
research and why it is important.
Tomorrow night's meeting will be
an open forum for discussing issues
relating to the research. David Clem, a
city councilman from Cambridge,
Mass., and Richard Goldstein, a Har
vard University microbiologist, will
speak to the meeting on recent con
flicts about recombinant DNA research
between townspeople and researchers
in that university community.
Anyone interested in speaking at
tomorrow's meeting should submit a
brief written notification to Anthony
Sidlow, Department of Health Physics,
Encina Hall.
Recombinant DNA research in

volves the creation of new biological
entities by implanting genetic material
(DNA) from one species (such as to
bacco mossaic virus) into the nucleus
of another species (such asE. coli bac
terium).
Possible benefits
Possible benefits from recombinant
DNA research include:
—the ability to produce cheaply
large quantities of such useful phar
maceuticals as insulin, antibiotics and
hormones;
—precise correction of hereditary
genetic defects;
—innovative forms of cancer
therapy; and
—"supercrops" with minimal needs
for additional nutrients.
Possible dangers from this research
include the production of mutant
species that will be immune to all
existing antibiotics and highly viru
lent in their effects on humans. Should
dangerous new species escape from
research laboratories into the general
environment they could reproduce
wildly with devastating effect.
Central issues in the nation-wide
controversy over the research are
whether it ought to be allowed to con
tinue at all, what adequate safeguards
are for experiments of various serious
ness, and who should set standards.
Of crucial importance in the debate
is the question of whether the possible
benefit of the genetic research are large
enough to offset the possible dangers.
'Ban studies'
A Cornell University professor,
Liebe Cavalieri. last week told a joint
session of the state assembly's Re
sources, Land Use and Energy Com
mittee and the Health Committee that
he thought the legislature should ban
most DNA studies now underway in
California, because the potential risks
are greater than potential benefits.
Cavalieri recommended that recom
binant DNA research be limited to one
or two laboratories under strict state
control.
Paul Berg, professor of biochemistrv
here, told the same joint assembly

committee Friday that "the only exper
iments being done today are experi
ments . . . that most people feel have
little or no risk," according to the As
sociated Press story published in
Saturday's Palo Alto Times.
Berg, in 1973, was one of the first
