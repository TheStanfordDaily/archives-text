Rally against Gandhi draws 50,000
New Delhi, India — More than 50,000 persons
turned out yesterday for the first opposition rally
permitted by the government in 19 months of
emergency rule as active political campaigning
began for the March parliamentary elections.
"1 never expected the turnout to be so great,"
former Deputy Prime Minister Morarji Desai told
the rally, which was organized on two days' notice
with little publicity. "It shows that the spirit of the
people is still alive."
Reports reaching New Delhi said the newly
formed Janata (People's) party headed by Desai also
held rallies in four other Indian cities — Jaipur,
Patna, Kanpur and Bombay — to kick off the cam
paign against Prime Minister Indira Candhi's Con
gress party, which has ruled India since indepen
dence in 1947.
The Congress party has not yet formal lv begun its
campaign, although Gandhi's controversial son,
Sanjay, has been barnstorming the country attack
ing the Janata party, which was formed las* week
through the merger of four non-Communist opposi
tion groups.
The rally in New Delhi was considered the most
significant because it was held on the same site —
the spacious Ram Lila grounds — where the last
opposition public meeting took place on June 25.
1975. A few hours afterward, the government proc
laimed an emergency, suspended civil liberties,
jailed opposition leaders and imposed press cen
sorship.
Carter urges four-day work week
Washington — Wearing a sweater and long un
derwear, President Jimmy Carter toured a chilly,
partially shut-down factory near Pittsburgh yester
day to emphasize the nation's deep-freeze energy
crisis. He called upon Americans to make even
greater sacrifices to ease the fuel shortage.
Carter urged persons with fireplaces toburn logs,
turn their thermostats as low as 50 degrees and
follow his long-underwear-and-sweater example.
He called on businesses and institutions to switch
to a four-day work week of 10 hours each day,

saying it's more energy efficient.
At the Pennsylvania turbine plant and in a wide
ranging conversation with reporters on his return
trip to Washington, Carter said he wants authority
to take natural gas away from industries that
employ few persons and make non-crucial pro
ducts and allocate it to industries that employ many
persons and make more essential goods.
He promised a comprehensive energy policy by
April 20. He said he would telephone and meet
with Congressional committee chairmen today to
discuss amendments, if any seem advisable, to his
emergency energy legislation before Congress. The
legislation would permit Carter to direct the dis
tribution of natural gas from areas with abundant
reserves to areas where shortages exist.
Congress works on gas rationing bill
Washington — The bitter weather and fuel
emergency dominates Congress this week as both
chambers work on legislation to give President
Jimmy Carter the natural gas rationing authority he
seeks.
Votes may come in the House and Senate by
tomorrow.
The House Commerce Committee planned to
finish work on its version today so that leaders
could schedule it for handling under speedup pro
cedures tomorrow.
The corresponding measure is already on the Se
nate floor, but faces a series of attempts to amend it.
Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), said he
would try to bring it to a vote today, but the odds
appeared against action that fast.
Carter's energy chief. James Schlesinger, earlier
pleaded for passage of the measure without major
change so that Carter could act quickly to control
gas supplies in hard-hit states where nearly half a
million workers have been idled by shutdown,
many schools are closed and, Schlesinger has said,
heating supplies for residences may be threatened
if the cold continues.
Archeologist freed after three years
Paris — French archeologist Francoise Claustre,
held hostage by rebels in the African country of
Chad for almost three years, and her husband have

been freed, the presidential palace announced last
night.

taing by telephone that t heClaustres had been freed
and taken to Tripoli, Libya.
In Tripoli, the Arab Revolution News Agency
said the Claustres were "in good health." An

the couple's return to Prance would be disclosed at
a news conference in the Libyan capital today.
NBC to televise Olympic games
Moscow — The National Broadcasting Co. has
been awarded the exclusive rights to televise the
1980 Moscow Olympic Games in the United States,
a company spokesman said yesterday.
The spokesman, emerging from private negotia
tions with representatives of the Soviet Olympic

ion.

Rally against Gandhi draws 50,000
New Delhi, India — More than 50,000 persons
turned out yesterday for the first opposition rally
permitted by the government in 19 months of
emergency rule as active political campaigning
began for the March parliamentary elections.
"1 never expected the turnout to be so great,"
former Deputy Prime Minister Morarji Desai told
the rally, which was organized on two days' notice
with little publicity. "It shows that the spirit of the
people is still alive."
Reports reaching New Delhi said the newly
formed Janata (People's) party headed by Desai also
held rallies in four other Indian cities — Jaipur,
Patna, Kanpur and Bombay — to kick off the cam
paign against Prime Minister Indira Candhi's Con
gress party, which has ruled India since indepen
dence in 1947.
The Congress party has not yet formal lv begun its
campaign, although Gandhi's controversial son,
Sanjay, has been barnstorming the country attack
ing the Janata party, which was formed las* week
through the merger of four non-Communist opposi
tion groups.
The rally in New Delhi was considered the most
significant because it was held on the same site —
the spacious Ram Lila grounds — where the last
opposition public meeting took place on June 25.

laimed an emergency, suspended civil liberties,

Carter urges four-day work week
Washington — Wearing a sweater and long un
derwear, President Jimmy Carter toured a chilly,
partially shut-down factory near Pittsburgh yester
day to emphasize the nation's deep-freeze energy
crisis. He called upon Americans to make even
greater sacrifices to ease the fuel shortage.
Carter urged persons with fireplaces toburn logs,
turn their thermostats as low as 50 degrees and
follow his long-underwear-and-sweater example.
He called on businesses and institutions to switch
to a four-day work week of 10 hours each day,

saying it's more energy efficient.
At the Pennsylvania turbine plant and in a wide
ranging conversation with reporters on his return
trip to Washington, Carter said he wants authority
to take natural gas away from industries that
employ few persons and make non-crucial pro
ducts and allocate it to industries that employ many
persons and make more essential goods.
He promised a comprehensive energy policy by
April 20. He said he would telephone and meet
with Congressional committee chairmen today to
discuss amendments, if any seem advisable, to his
emergency energy legislation before Congress. The
legislation would permit Carter to direct the dis
tribution of natural gas from areas with abundant
reserves to areas where shortages exist.
Congress works on gas rationing bill
Washington — The bitter weather and fuel
emergency dominates Congress this week as both
chambers work on legislation to give President
Jimmy Carter the natural gas rationing authority he
seeks.
Votes may come in the House and Senate by
tomorrow.
The House Commerce Committee planned to
finish work on its version today so that leaders
could schedule it for handling under speedup pro
cedures tomorrow.
The corresponding measure is already on the Se
nate floor, but faces a series of attempts to amend it.
Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), said he
would try to bring it to a vote today, but the odds
appeared against action that fast.
Carter's energy chief. James Schlesinger, earlier
pleaded for passage of the measure without major
change so that Carter could act quickly to control
gas supplies in hard-hit states where nearly half a
million workers have been idled by shutdown,
many schools are closed and, Schlesinger has said,
heating supplies for residences may be threatened
if the cold continues.

Congress works on gas rationing bill
Washington — The bitter weather and fuel
emergency dominates Congress this week as both
chambers work on legislation to give President
Jimmy Carter the natural gas rationing authority he
seeks.
Votes may come in the House and Senate by
tomorrow.
The House Commerce Committee planned to
finish work on its version today so that leaders
could schedule it for handling under speedup pro
cedures tomorrow.
The corresponding measure is already on the Se
nate floor, but faces a series of attempts to amend it.
Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), said he
would try to bring it to a vote today, but the odds
appeared against action that fast.
Carter's energy chief. James Schlesinger, earlier
pleaded for passage of the measure without major
change so that Carter could act quickly to control
gas supplies in hard-hit states where nearly half a
million workers have been idled by shutdown,
many schools are closed and, Schlesinger has said,
heating supplies for residences may be threatened
if the cold continues.

NBC to televise Olympic games
Moscow — The National Broadcasting Co. has
been awarded the exclusive rights to televise the
1980 Moscow Olympic Games in the United States,
a company spokesman said yesterday.
The spokesman, emerging from private negotia
tions with representatives of the Soviet Olympic
Organizing Committee and state television, refused
to give details on the terms of the contract, which
some have speculated could cost up to $100 mill

recent years have been cornered by the American
Broadcasting Co., will be signed by NBC and the

said there is no doubt that his company has clearly
been awarded the contract.
In New York, an NBC spokesman said: "We have
been very pleased with the spirit, cooperation and
friendly atmosphere which have marked our
negotiations. Particularly, we wish to express our
appreciation to Mr. Ignati Novikov, president of the
delegation of the organizing committee of the 1980
Games in Mosocw, for his direction in coordinating
these arrangements."

Rally against Gandhi draws 50,000
New Delhi, India — More than 50,000 persons
turned out yesterday for the first opposition rally
permitted by the government in 19 months of
emergency rule as active political campaigning
began for the March parliamentary elections.
"1 never expected the turnout to be so great,"
former Deputy Prime Minister Morarji Desai told
the rally, which was organized on two days' notice
with little publicity. "It shows that the spirit of the
people is still alive."
Reports reaching New Delhi said the newly
formed Janata (People's) party headed by Desai also
held rallies in four other Indian cities — Jaipur,
Patna, Kanpur and Bombay — to kick off the cam
paign against Prime Minister Indira Candhi's Con
gress party, which has ruled India since indepen
dence in 1947.
The Congress party has not yet formal lv begun its
campaign, although Gandhi's controversial son,
Sanjay, has been barnstorming the country attack
ing the Janata party, which was formed las* week
through the merger of four non-Communist opposi
tion groups.
The rally in New Delhi was considered the most
significant because it was held on the same site —
the spacious Ram Lila grounds — where the last
opposition public meeting took place on June 25.

laimed an emergency, suspended civil liberties,
jailed opposition leaders and imposed press cen
sorship.
Carter urges four-day work week
Washington — Wearing a sweater and long un
derwear, President Jimmy Carter toured a chilly,
partially shut-down factory near Pittsburgh yester
day to emphasize the nation's deep-freeze energy
crisis. He called upon Americans to make even
greater sacrifices to ease the fuel shortage.
Carter urged persons with fireplaces toburn logs,
turn their thermostats as low as 50 degrees and
follow his long-underwear-and-sweater example.
He called on businesses and institutions to switch
to a four-day work week of 10 hours each day,

saying it's more energy efficient.
At the Pennsylvania turbine plant and in a wide
ranging conversation with reporters on his return
trip to Washington, Carter said he wants authority
to take natural gas away from industries that
employ few persons and make non-crucial pro
ducts and allocate it to industries that employ many
persons and make more essential goods.
He promised a comprehensive energy policy by
April 20. He said he would telephone and meet
with Congressional committee chairmen today to
discuss amendments, if any seem advisable, to his
emergency energy legislation before Congress. The
legislation would permit Carter to direct the dis
tribution of natural gas from areas with abundant
reserves to areas where shortages exist.
