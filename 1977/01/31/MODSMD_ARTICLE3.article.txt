## It's COLD back East

New York (AP) — More than 1.5 million persons were
out of work as a cold wave continued through the
weekend, forcing the closing of factories and businesses
and a curtailment of natural gas consumption. At least 45
deaths were blamed on the weather in the nation's eastern
and mid-western states.
Ohio reported the highest number of workers sent home
when plants closed. The state Department of Community
Development said yesterday one million persons, 25 per
cent of the state's work force, had been laid off because of
the Arctic-like weather.
Weather-related deaths from exposure, fires, heart at
tacks and carbon monoxide poisoning were reported in 10
states and 16 persons weremissing in the ruin of a burned
out hotel in Breckinridge, Minn. Workmen were trying to
dig through the still smoking rubble.
President Jimmy Carter flew to Pittsburgh yesterday to
examine western Pennsylvania, an area hit hard by the
frigid winter and resulting energy crisis. "1 want to see
first-hand the impact of the weather on a high concentra
tion of employment," Carter said.
Temperatures near or below zero combined with winds
of 25 to 40 miles an hour along the north Atlantic Coast,
the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley and the
northern Plains. Wind-chill factors of 60 below zero or
more were common across portions of Minnesota and the
Dakotas early in the weekend.
Little relief
Although temperatures eased upward yesterday into
the teens and 20s in the northern parts of the Kast, little
relief from the cold weather was forecast for the rest of the
weekend, and unseasonably cold temperatures were ex
pected through today. Freezing rain mixed with snow fell
from Texas across the Southeast as afternoon tempera
tures ranged from highs in the upper 20s to the upper 30s
yesterday.
New gas shutoffs in New York state were expected to
more than double the 100,000 layoffs recorded there al
ready.
The gas crisis prompted Gov. Hugh Carey to order on
Saturday that all schools in the state heated by natural gas

close for the coming week. He also suspended laws requir
ing apartment buildings be kept at temperatures above 05
degrees.
Thousands laid off
At least 20,000 workers were laid off in New Jersey on
Friday and residents were ordered to turn down the heat
in their homes. Officials said further restrictions on the
use of natural gas could bring as many as 400,000 layoifs
in coming days.
Thousands of persons were out of work in a dozen other
eastern states, officials said.
Carter said Saturday he may urge industries to go on a
four-day work week because of the shortage of natural gas
brought on by heavy demand.
Disaster relief
Carter also said he was ordering federal disaster relief
for New York and Pennsylvania because of the extreme
cold, snow and ice in those states and will sign emergency
aid legislation for Florida today because of weather
inflicted crop losses there.
Carter said 11 states are in "some degree of crisis" and
six states are having problems because of blizzard condi
tions.
Buffalo continued to feel the whip of high winds yester
day. two days after a blizzard spun off Lake Erie, paralyz
ing the area.
Carter declared Buffalo and Frie County and three sur
rounding counties in a state of emergency Saturday, mak
ing federal aid available.
Worst ever
The blizzard, which began Friday afternoon, lasted \7 x k
hours before ending early Saturday morning and was the
worst storm of the worst winter in the history of Buffalo,
meterologists said. Buffalo, which normally gets about 44
inches of snow by this time of year, has had 153 inches.
Indiana schools will remain closed and officials said the
natural gas supply in the state was unchanged — "criti
cal."
On the West Coast, Californians had the satisfaction of
being one up on their eastern counterparts.
