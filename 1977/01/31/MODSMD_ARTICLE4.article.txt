# Friedman discusses Chile involvement, favors 'inefficient bureaucracies'
## 
### Marc Strassman News analysis 
After receiving the Nobel Prize in
economics last year. Milton Friedman
has drawn widespread criticism for
having given economic advice to lead
ers of Chile's junta.
But Friedman, now a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, told the Daily,
"I'm not going to take any responsibil
ity for policies of the junta."
His advice was limited to five or six
days at the end of March 1975, Fried
man said, when he met with persons in
and out of Chile's government, includ
ing Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Chile's
president.
Friedman reviewed his involvement
with Chile and offered views on pre
sent economic conditions during an
exclusive interview Friday with the
Daily.
The advice he gave Chile's rulers,
said Friedman, was no different from
what he said in public lectures there.
"I always say the same thing in public
as I say in private," he asserted.
'No contact'
"I have had no contact with any offi
cial of Chile since then," he said.
Whatever his connection with junta
policy makers. Friedman said he ag
reed with Chile's three-part economic
policy. This policy features:
—freeing prices and markets;
—returning manufacturing and
banking enterprises to private owner

ship; and
—cutting government spending as a
means of reducing monetary growth.
Peduced monetary growth, accord
ing to Friedman, is the "one thing
that's essential."
The Chilean economy, he said, "is
not well; it is far from being well." But,
he added, "there is no painless way" to
make necessary corrections.
Sick economy
Comparing the Chilean economy to
a very sick patient, Friedman said that
for such a patient, there is "never a
cure that gets him up the next day."
Most of the cuts in government
spending have affected only middle
and upper class bureaucrats, said
Friedman. Me added that the junta has
introduced make-work programs to
provide temporary assistance to indi
viduals hurt by government policy.
The junta is following policies that
will eventually make its own replace
ment possible, Friedman said "Chile
will not be able to get rid of the junta
unless it gets its inflation rate down to
the 30-35 per cent per year that has
been the normal rate there," he added.
Friedman said he went to Chile be
cause, like natural scientists who go
where mountains and oceans are to
study these things, he, as an economist
and expert on inflation, went where
inflation existed.
He said the hyperinflation experi
enced by Chile under the junta was the

result of Allende government policies,
such as price freezing and the doubl
ing or tripling of wages. Inflation ap
peared during the Pinochet regime's
tenure, but was not caused by that re
gime's policies, he said.
Recalling the 1970 Nobel Prize
ceremonies, Friedman said a lecture

by Saul Bellow was "the best" part of
the event.
Friedman said he was not much af
fected by "so-called protests" against
him there. Protesters claimed he was
"the power behind the throne." re

sponsible for the day-to-day opera
tions of the junta.
Just as his name was read to receive
his award, said Fi iedman, "a young
man (who had sneaked in on his
father's ticket) stood up and shouted,
Down with capitalism! Freedom for
Chile!"
Asked what he expected President
Jimmy Carter to do, Friedman said,
"Whatever is politically profitable.
"The name and personality of the
president make far less difference" on
economic policy than commonly sup
posed.
Saving inefficiency
He said he favored "inefficient
bureaucracies," since their ineffi
ciency is the "one thing saving us."
Friedman said he favored a "free
market" economy as the most effective
way to prevent capitalists from gain
ing too much political power.
Me said that "big business, as rep
resented by such groups as the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, is not a promo
ter of free enterprise."
Friedman called for abolishing all
federal regulatory agencies, such as
the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the Federal Communications
Commission, which he said resulted in
government monopolies in transporta
tion and broadcasting.
He also called for eliminating
licenses to practice medicine. Prohibi-
