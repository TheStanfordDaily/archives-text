# Terman Building engineered for energy
## 
### Laura Kennedy 
The Frederick E. Terman Engineering Building,
scheduled to be completed in April, is one of the
most energy-conscious buildings ever built on this
campus.
Among its revolutionary features: windows that
open.
"If there had been no energy crisis, it would have
been different," said L. Farrell McGhie, associate
dean of the School of Engineering. The school
hopes to move into the Terman Building by June, he
said.
Planning on the $9.2 million Terman Building
began in 1973 at the height of the energy crisis, said
McGhie. Originally, he noted, the engineering
school faculty wanted no part of the building to be
artificially cooled. „
Outside exposure
However, with such a large building, "it simply
was not possible" to design all rooms with an out
side exposure, said McGhie.
The Terman Building is built in an "L" shape, to
allow for as many windows as possible. All the
offices, located on the second, third and fourth
floors, will be naturally cooled.
Louvered shutters can be rolled across the win
dows to cut off the sun and still let air through. In
addition, office doors have an unusual two-part
construction that allows professors to let air
through the door's louvers without disturbing the
privacy of the office.
Roughly 70 per cent of Terman will be air
conditioned, according to senior planner Carroll
Rankin, architect for the project.
In addition to the long-term energy savings of the
building due to lowered cooling costs and de
creased wattage of the lighting, the $7 million tab
for construction is cheaper than for comparable

buildings, Rankin said.
Using wooden beams in all exterior work above
the first floor and in all interior work was cheaper
than using reinforced concrete, Rankin said.
No solar energy
The initial expense and the "state of the art" of
solar energy when Terman was planned three years
ago caused the School of Engineering to abandon
the idea of using solar energy, according to
McGhie. He said the school was unable to get a
research grant to finance the research it considered
was necessary before solar energy could be used in
the building.
The building should last at least 100 years, said
Rankin, noting that fossil fuel is not expected to run
out before then.
The Terman Building will be heated by the Uni
versity's steam system, while the classrooms,
laboratories, library and computer room will be
artificially cooled, said Rankin.
Computer students on the Terman side of cam
pus, who presently have to trek across campus to
Low Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) facilities in
the Stanford Center for Research and Development
in Teaching, will get a break when LOTS terminals
are installed in the first floor of Terman.
Also on the first floor will be two classrooms, two
other classrooms equipped with closed-circuit
television, a 260-seat lecture hall and a student
lounge area.
Ground level
The first floor will be at ground level on the side
facing the Mitchell F'arth Sciences Building. Tel
man's two-story principal entrance will be an ex
tension of the mall between the Mitchell and
Durand Buildings.
The principal entrance will lead out to a wide
rear deck, extending around the "L" of the build

ing, and looking out over an eight-inch deep pool,
ivy-covered "islands" and a small waterfall.
A curving ramp walk will border the far side of
the pool, leading to a basement entrance.
Laboratories, all located in the basement, will
extend to the full 18-foot height of the basement to
accommodate ductwork and high lab equipment.
An unusual feature of Terman Building is that all
ductwork and piping will not be covered up by a
dropped ceiling but left exposed.
"Well, after all, it's an engineering building,"
one workmaft pointed out.
Basement offices
Also in the basement will be two levels of offices,
all with windows facing the pool. The interior labs
will get exposure to outside light through shafts
coming down from the first floor, cutting through
the basement mezzanine corridor.
The large number of offices in Terman Building
is necessary because 75 per cent of the students in
the School of Engineering are graduate students,
said Rankin. "They're mostly pencil-paper kind of
engineers," he explained.
Rankin said oach office in the new building can
accommodate three graduate students or one pro
fessor.
The engineering library will be in the second to
fourth floors of the "fat leg" of the "L," facing the
Women's Gvm. The floor levels of the two stories of
stacks at each side of the library do not conform to
the three stories of offices to the left of the library.
The different floor levels will be connected by
ramps ornamented with a large round window on
each floor.
The steep roof of Terman Building will allow a
fifth floor, occupied by design studios for Mechani
cal Engineering on the "fat leg" side and offices on
the "narrow log side.
