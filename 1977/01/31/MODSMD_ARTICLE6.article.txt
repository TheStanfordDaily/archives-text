## Raising hell 
### 
It is a newspaper's duty to print the news and
raise hell.
â€”The Chicago Times, 1861
Raising hell is a bit like raising children.
There are many ways of going about it and no
matter which method you choose, you are
never sure how your final product will turn out.
But at least you can define your ideal product
and establish some guidelines which will aid
you in coming as close to your ideal as possible.
I want this volume to raise hell. By spring,
this newspaper should stimulate you, entertain
you and inform you to the point where you
actively look for the Daily each morning be
cause you need it to start the day off right. This
is my goal for Volume 171 which begins today.
You may notice there are few new names in
our staff box. How can the paper be much diffe
rent, you may ask, when familiar names merely
have been juggled to fill new positions? Actu
ally the phenomenon shows that we have a very
strong and experienced staff. Instead of being
busy learning mechanical skills, the editors can

concentrate on improving the content of their
pages. Reporters will have the opportunity to
develop their skills more thoroughly instead of
sacrificing their talents to the Peter Principle.
In news, we are organizing team reporting
and improving the beat system to provide you
with more thorough coverage. We will be run
ning more previews in news and entertainment
to inform you of the relevance of individuals
and events before they speak or occur. We will
provide you with a more thorough guide of how
to entertain yourself with an expanded Spec
trograph and film summaries. The features de
partment has been expanded to give you more
colorful stories in an attractive format.
We are working on improving the Daily but
we need your help. Come to our monthly
forums led by corporation chairman Robert
Michael Smith. Call us with story ideas or join
our staff and write for us. We want the Daily to
be your newspaper. Let's raise hell together.
