# Smokers have rights, too

Kim Howland

Both smokers and non-smokers
would probably agree that cigarette
smoking is one of the most annoying
and dirty habits anyone could have.
Few would argue the point that the
rights of non-smokers are consistently
ignored, and in public places few
non-smokers ever actually protest
against smoking, even-when it is par
ticularly irritating.
This is not, however, the case at
Stanford. In fact, at Stanford the pen
dulum seems to have swung in the op
posite direction so that one finds the
rights of smokers, particularly the lib
erty to smoke and study in an area
conducive to studying, continually
ignored.
1 myself am a cigarette smoker. 1
realize smoking is highly irritating to
most non-smokers, and it is important
to me that their privileges to study, live
in their dormitory rooms, and eat
without being bothered by cigarette
smoke are not disregarded.
No concessions
At Stanford, however, while par
ticular attention is paid to the non
smoker's rights, no concessions are
made except by a few individuals for
smokers. This point was made espe
cially clear to me recently when an
announcement was printed in the
"Toyon Garbage List" that there is to

be no smoking henceforth in the "Gold
Room" or the "Moose Room," the only
study areas available to students at
reasonable hours in Toyon Hall.
Since 1 do not smoke in my room
because my roommates are nonsmok
ers, I have found that there is no well
lit, reasonably quiet place for me to
smoke and study. This is not to say that
nonsmokers should be forced to put up
with smoke-filled rooms in which to
study; on the contrary, their point is
well taken.
Room for smokers
Why isn't there, however, a room
conducive to study which is desig
nated for smoking? Gertainly one
could not argue that the downstairs
lobby of Meyer Library or the terrace
are comparable, especially at night, to
other study areas in Meyer in which
smoking is not allowed.
Also, the Transition at Tresidder
Union is quite inadequate for study
ing, unless of course, one washes to
discuss one's work with a friend.
While smoking is certainly not a
habit that should be condoned by the
university, the fact that there are Stan
ford students who smoke should be
acknowledged. Why shouldn't smok
ers have the opportunity to study
under favorable conditions and still be
able to smoke?

If one or possibly two rooms in
Meyer and one of the two study rooms
in, for example, Toyon Hall, were de
signated for smoking, nonsmokers
would still be able to study without
being troubled by eye irritating smoke,
and smokers would be able to smoke
and study in a room which is well lit
and quiet.
With this sort of arrangement,
neither the smoker's nor the
nonsmoker's rights would be in
fringed upon, and each could study in
a way that suits him best.
