Rarely has technology
served music so well.
The Beogram 4002 is an audio component of such
quality in concept, performance, and design that the
alternatives seem hopelessly outdated.
Computer logic circuits provide for completely
automatic operation of the Beogram 4002, a single touch
of the Start switch and further assistance is unnecessary.
The entire cycie—from your touch to music—takes
hardly more than two seconds. When a selection is
finished, the arm returns automatically to the rest \
position and shuts the unit off. Power assisted manual I
operation allows you to scan the entire record at slow i
or fast speed in either direction; you can cue the stylus
tip into exactly the groove you select. The sophisticated,
tangential tracking system eliminates the distortions
caused by angular tracking error, skating force, and
horizontal friction. The Beogram 4002 turntable comes
furnished with Bang & Olufsen's finest cartridge, the
critically acclaimed MMC 6000.
To appreciate the features and distinction of the
Beogram 4002 requires a personal evaluation.
Stop in and ask us for a complete demonstration.
