To hear music beautifully reproduced is one of iife's greatest pleasures But it's a pleasure that the
people who listen to little radios, giant consoles or poorly designed all-in-one compacts never have.
The truth is, only real high fidelity components give you real high fidelity sound. Real high fidelity
can be really expensive if you're a purist who doesn't care about price. But at Alco you can also get a
quality Pioneer System featuring the SX-750 receiver for a lot less money than you'd expect to pay! So
bad sound is unnecessary. It's unjustifiable. Come in and we'll prove it! Also featured in this system
are two Klipsch Heresy Stereo Loudspeakers and a super Technics SL-23 belt-drive turntable
complete with Base, tinted dustcover and an Audio Technica AT-444 cartridge.
