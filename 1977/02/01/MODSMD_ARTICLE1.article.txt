# Law prof, to get high post in Justice Department?
## 
### 
Barbara Babcock, associate profes
sor of law here, confirmed yesterday
that she is being considered for a posi
tion as head of the civil division of the
U.S. Justice Department.
Babcock refused to comment further
on the appointment until results are
officially announced by President
Jimmy Carter. That announcement is
expected to come later this week.
Before coming to the Law School,
Babcock directed the Public Defender
Service in Washington, D.C. While in
that position, she directed a large staff
which supervised defense of persons
not normally able to secure adequate
legal counseling—mostly the poor,
members of minority groups and the
mentally ill.
Babcock, who teaches civil proce
dure here is also the author of a civil
casebook Sex Discrimination: Causes
and Remedies. She will also co-author
an upcoming book, also on civil pro
cedure, with Paul Carringdon of the
Michigan Law School.
Babcock is a native of Washington,
D.C. She is a graduate of the University
of Pennsylvania and Yale Law School.
She served as a law clerk to Judge
Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of
Appeals, then spent two years with the
firm of Washington attorney Edward
Bennett Williams.
In a series of lectures given to incom
ing freshmen in 1974, Babcock
examined the responsibility of lawyers
who w r ork as public defenders.
She said clients who require public
defenders' services are usually disad
vantaged and cannot pay for the ser
vices. Thus, public defenders are con
stantly swamped at nearly every level.
According to Babcock, this contri
butes to the already overloaded court
dockets and leads to "plea copping",
(pleading guilty to lesser offenses), al
though i bents may actually be not
guilty.
In one of those lectures, Babcock
said support for the public defender
program "is just a straight resource
problem. We have the talent and we
need the money."
The position which Babcock is
likely to be offered would place her
under Attorney General Griffin Bell. It
is expected she will take a leave of
absence from the University.
