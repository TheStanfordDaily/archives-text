# Stanford- in-Britain:
## Going the way of the English upper class? 
### Dave Ansley 
S tanford-in-Britain is being
moved from Cliveden to Oxford. It's
being moved to London. It's being
moved to Mexico. It's definitely
alive. It's definitely dead. Maybe
yes, maybe no.
The university is deliberating the
fate of the popular overseas study
center at Cliveden amid a storm of
rumor and confusion. Many fear
that Cliveden might go the way of
the British aristocracy, and
everyone seems to have heard a dif
ferent inside story-
Cliveden's not dead yet, and no
decisions affecting its fate are likely
for at least three weeks. But there is
a possibility that Stanford will
abandon its estate on the Thames in
December 1978.
-A. 19th century mansion hidden
by 400 acres of Buckinghamshire
woods west of London houses as
many as HO students every quarter.
Hy far the largest of Stanford's eight
overseas centers, it represents one
third of the University's overseas
positions.
The center is not lacking in popu
larity; attendance at the former
Astor enclave has averaged better
than 00 per cent of capacity since
the campus opened in 1969. There
are 57 students on the spring quar
ter waiting list.
Those accepted to attend Clive
den may choose from nine or 10
classes in British politics, history,
art, music and theater.
Surrounded by rural England,
they also have access to urban Eng
land. London is 45 minutes away.
But questions have arisen among
Stanford faculty and administrators
about the value of Cliveden's
academic program, the cost of leas
ing the building, and the distance
from Cliveden to London, Eng
land's major Cultural center.
Returning students have been
quick to defend the campus. The
Save Cliveden Committee cites the
center's "mixture of the historical
and the contemporary" and the av
ailability of interactions with local
peopleastwoofitsoutstandingfea
tures.
(jliveden's fate is tied to the ac
tions of a committee and two ad
ministrators.
The Committee on Foreign
Studies Programs (CFSP), an arm of
the Faculty .Senate, is responsible
for making policies regarding
academic programs at overseas
campuses. It advises the director of
the overseas program and reviews
his actions.
Mark Mancall is that director. He
is in charge of the Overseas Office
and tries to follow guidelines of the
CFSP. He has to turn in an annual
budget to . . .
Provost William Miller, who con
trols the size of the overseas budget.
One thing is certain. The
Stanford-in-Britain campus won't
be moved from Cliveden to either
London or Oxford, as last year's
CFSP proposed.
Mancall says that "the alterna
tives were simply too expensive."
He proposed to the CFSP in De
cember that it recommend "that if a
Stanford Overseas Study Center is
to be maintained in England, it be
located at Cliveden." The CFSP ap
proved it, but with an amendment
proposed by Assoc. English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz: ". . . unless before
the time for the decision about
Cliveden is reached a preferable site
is discovered."
Mancall says that since the De
cember meeting other options have

not been explored.
"In my opinion, the only alterna
tive we know of is Cliveden or no
thing."
Economics Prof. Paul David, cur
rent chairman of the CFSP, says
"most committee members would
be well-satisfied to have the prog
ram remain at Cliveden." I3ut he
adds, "The situation is not 'Clive
den or nothing.' Other locations
might be considered if Cliveden
was unavailable."
Two upcoming decisions will de
termine whether Cliveden is avail
able.
The first is Provost Miller's re
sponse to the Overseas Studies Of
fice's budget proposals.
Two years ago, the provost's of
fice told overseas studies it had to
cut its general funds budget in half
by September 1978. Mancall says
this was a political and structural
decision.

"We don't have a constituency,
we don't have tenured faculty,
vva're not a department or school.
We have no bargaining position.
We're weak politically. So in the
fund competition, we are going to
lose out."
Yet Mancall is not disheartened.
"Some people thought they could
cure the financial problem by com
pletely eliminating overseas
studies. At the same time, we have
some strong supporters among the
faculty and administration. Saving
50 per cent ($800,000) of our budget
was not a defeat."
The overseas office has tried to
avoid dropping programs, but its
campus in Beutelsbach, Germany
was closed last summer, and its Ber
lin campus is being financed sepa
rately by the provost's office.
Mancall has given Miller a
budget proposal for the 1077-78 fis
cal year. According to Mancall, that
proposal includes long-range plans

to renegotiate the Cliveden lease
and maintain the study center there
after December 1978, when the cur
rent lease runs out.
But the budget proposal does not
achieve the 50 per cent cutback.
Mancall would not discuss figures,
but said the budget "approaches"
the goal, and that the discrepancy is
not a significant percentage of
Cliveden's cost, which totals
$166,000 per year.
Miller won't indicate whether he
will accept the budget.
"1 can't say anything definite.
Everyone else has asked for more
than we can allocate, and we have
to look at it in view of other deci
sions." he says.
"I think the program level that we
had been aiming at is a very sensi
ble one," Miller says. This is about
900 student-quarters per year.
The total number of student
quarters overseas is now 959, and
Mancall's proposal for next year
does not include Berlin's 50

student-quarters, leaving 909
student-quarters in the proposal.
The provost says his budget deci
sion will be made in three or four
weeks.
If he accepts the budget, Cliveden
has cleared this hurdle. If he rejects
the budget. Mancall isn't certain
what the effect will be. There are
many items in the budget, and
Cliveden isn't the only one that can
be cut.
"The provost's office is fully
aware of the implications of its de
cisions. It is not inconceivable that
the provost's office could make cer
tain budget decisions that would
force us out of Cliveden." Mancall
says.
But it doesn't appear likely that
any other campuses will be cut first.
Mancall and the CFSP have de
cided, for the time being at least,
that Cliveden is the lowest-priority
overseas campus.
This was based, Mancall says, on
the opinion that because of the lan

guage, access for students to Eng
land is easier. The other campuses
are in countries where it would be
more difficult to study or travel
alone.
"That would weigh heavily on
our decision," Mancall says.
The second upcoming decision
could make all debate a waste ot
time.
Britain's National Trust, which
leases the building to Stanford, will
decide in April how much to charge
for the lease after December 197 H.
Stanford is now paying 3300
pounds ($5600) rent per year, but
that doesn't take into account extra
renovation and modernization
which the University pays for.
Mancall has proposed <1 lease "we
could live with," but it isn't known
whether the National Trust is likely
to accept it.
According to dale llurd. one ot
the CFSP's two student members.
"The National Trust will come up
with a sum they will accept tor rent
They originally proposed an un
reasonable amount, but they are re
considering."
There is another problem. The
National Trust may not be able to
lease Cliveden to anyone; the build-.
ing may be needed to house the
Trust's offices.
Mancall says,"The National
Trust and we get along very well.
But it is not inconceivable that they
couldn't afford to keep us there."
Let's say the National Trust can
afford to keep Stanford:
"If the provost doesn't cut our~
budget proposal in certain waysr
and the National Trust agrees to ouiÂ£
lease proposal, then we could stay-,
at Cliveden, everything else being"
equal," Mancall says.
Then comes one more choice*
Does Stanford want to stay in Bri
tain?
"Thecommittee will meet within
the next month to decide whether
the program in England is to be con
tinued at Cliveden. (Last year's
CFSP) recommended closing
Cliveden and opening others. So far
this committee has acted to main
tain continuity in policy, but we are
not bound to follow that aspect oC
their recommendations." says Prof.
David.
One of last year's CFSP decisions"
was to recommend "that a new
program be established in the His
panic language-culture area, pref
erably in Mexico City.'
David says, "Within the present
budget base, it doesn't appear one
could maintain an English program
and develop a Mexican or third
world campus. Mexico and Eng
land are competitive."
Mancall says, "On principal. I
don't believe in sacrificing a suc
cessful program for a new one.
Cliveden is not as good as it could
be, but none ever are, and we're
constantly working to improve it.''
Hurd says, "1 wouldn't like to see
Cliveden closed in order to initiate
a new overseas study center. I
would say that the general senti
ment of the committee concurs with
my opinion, but I can't say what
would happen if it came dcwn to a
vote."
It all adds up to this:
If the provost accepts a budget
that includes money for Cliveden
and if the National Trust likes Man
call's offer and if the CFSP decides
it wants to keep a British campus,
then Cliveden will probably stay
open after 197 H. But we won't know
until April. So don't hold your
breath.
