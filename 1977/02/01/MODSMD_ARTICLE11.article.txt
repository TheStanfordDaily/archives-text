## 'Marat/Sade' whips into shape 
### Karen Caesar 
The light is harsh on the bare
wooden stage platform where
English Prof. Larry Eriedlander
kneels, whimpering. He moans,
gasps, clutches at nothing and as
he cries out, the woman with the
whip stands behind him silently,
her head down, her face hidden
by masses of hanging limp yel
low hair. Again and again she
punctuates each dramatic pause
by lashing Friedlander's back
until he verges on crumbling
into an exhausted, sweaty heap.
His forehead glistens with pers
piration as he struggles to stay
on his knees.
Now we've all daydreamed
about flogging certain nasty pro
fessors who give us Cs when we
deserve As, but this is no fantasy
of revenge; it is the day's first
run-through of Marat/Sade's in
famous flogging scent), and as it
comes crasni ng to a halt, director
Robert Eagan approaches Fried
lander (who portrays that father
of modern Sadism, the Marquis
de Sade) and ex-graduate stu
dent Carol Hunker (who plays
Charlotte Corday, the "woman
with the whip"). Synchronizing
the lashings with Sade's
monologue is the crucial issue

here; the timing isn't right; using
an imaginary instrument of tor
ture just isn't working.
"We can probably get some
thing that approximates a
whip," says Eagan as he bends
over to pick up a piece of wood.
"Here, how about this board?"
Friedlander groans, then laughs
warily as he talks about the
suede whip they are actually
planning to use while perform
ing. "Supposedly it doesn't hurt
but it cracks when it lands,"
Friedlander says. "I'll believe it
when I see it."
"Also, they say that this par
ticular whip leaves red marks,"
says Eagan. Friedlander shoots
him a sidelong glance; he is not
amused.
Flogging details
But director Eagan has to
worry about things much more
important than the mundane
mechanical details involved in
floggings. In choosing to do
Marat/Sade, he willingly took on
a cast of 47, ranging in age from
18 to "over 40," and received
along with it all the headaches
inherent in dealing with such a
large array of loonies.
Set in a mental institution in
early 19th century France, theof

ficial title of the play reads —
The Persecution and Assassina
tion of Jean-Paul Marat as Per
formed by the Inmates of the
Asylum of Charenton Under the
Direction of the Marquis de
Sade. and although it's tempting
to draw a parallel with the
asylum and a typical rehearsal,
Eagan seems to have everything
under control.
A third year graduate student
in drama directing and criti
cism, the 26-year old Eagan
graduated from Boston College
with a concentration in political
science, economics, and English
literature. He did graduate work,
at Oxford in philosophy and En
glish literature, and is now on
his way to completing a PhD. He
chose to present Marat-Sade for
a variety of reasons, many of
which include what he feels is a
special relevance to the Stanford
community. "Peopleareaffected
by their social environment,"
says Eagan. Of the students ai)d
faculty who portray the inmates,
all of whom have to create their
own roles, concoct their own in
sane backgrounds and even
select their own names, Eagan
says"I don't have to fabricate
problems for them; they're al
ieady there. It all stems from
problems in their own lives," he
says.
The play is complex in that all
the characters, including Marat
and Sade, have double roles;
each has to portray a presumably
insane inmate and also an actor
in the plays the Marquis de Sade
puts on inside the institution.
The plot is far too complicated to
reveal in a brief precis; refer to its
lengthy title to obtain the basic
plot summary. "The play is
working on so many levels at
once, you have this extremely
rich and complicated event,"
says Eriedlander. "All the issues
of the French Revolution are de
bated on stage. The play is about
ideas; Marxism, existentialism;
it really is an extraordinarily in
teresting play to do," he says.
'Mental aberration'
Eagan concurs, but notes the
problem of how difficult it is to
get such a varied cast to "explore
in a theatrical environment what
it is like to be oppressed and
stifled to the extent where it
would probably begin to start
some mental abberation in a be
lievable way." He says utilizing
improvisation helped to bring

out some of the possibilities.
The play itself was written in
the early 1960s by German au
thor Peter Weiss, a Jew who left
Germany when WW II broke out
and ended up in Sweden. Ac
cording to Eagan, Weiss chose to
live in the West, and viewed it as
oppressive and insane. The op
pression and various confronta
tions Weiss experienced as a
Jew, first through the war and
then on through the '50s and
'60s, eventually culminated in
the writing of Mamt/Sade.
Eagan characterized the au
thor as a man who was "search
ing." He elaborates: "So what
did he (Weiss) do? He chose to
write a play set in a mental in
stitution — a metaphor of a
world that's insane.
"On one side you have the op
pressed, the inmates, and on the
other side you have the audi
ence, the ones who could afford
to pay for their tickets," those
who in a way "precipitated that
oppression."
"Springing up in the middle
of that metaphor," Eagan con
tinues, "we have two intelligent
responses. There is Marat
(played by Jamie Reid), a pre-
Marxist thinker," who believes
that the "only way to change the
insanity, to bring about a world
where some freedom exists is to
tear down the old, oppressive in
stitutions and people who go
along with them," even if it has
to involve bloodshed. Marat's
basic opinion, according to
Eagan, is that "it's worth it to kill
hundreds to save millions."
'Man of dignity'
Eagan sees Sade as someone
quite different. "Sade represents
a compassionate, concerned
man of dignity. ... He sees the
whole world, not only man, the
whole cosmos, nature, as indif
ferent, unconcerned. That is the
way of the world, and man is es
sentially animalistic, selfish
within his own nature."
The story of the Marquis de
Sade and Jean-Paul Marat will
be presented by the Drama De
partment Feb. 23-26 and March
1 -5 at 8 p.m. in the Scene Shop of
Memorial Auditorium. With
hopes of involving the viewers,
the audience will, for the most
part, be seated on stage, and the
play itself promises to be a com
pelling and involving enough
production to keep them there.

by lashing Friedlander's back
until he verges on crumbling
into an exhausted, sweaty heap.
His forehead glistens with pers
piration as he struggles to stay
on his knees.
Now we've all daydreamed
about flogging certain nasty pro
fessors who give us Cs when we
deserve As, but this is no fantasy
of revenge; it is the day's first
run-through of Marat/Sade's in
famous flogging scent), and as it
comes crasni ng to a halt, director
Robert Eagan approaches Fried
lander (who portrays that father
of modern Sadism, the Marquis
de Sade) and ex-graduate stu
dent Carol Hunker (who plays
Charlotte Corday, the "woman
with the whip"). Synchronizing
the lashings with Sade's
monologue is the crucial issue

here; the timing isn't right; using
an imaginary instrument of tor
ture just isn't working.
"We can probably get some
thing that approximates a
whip," says Eagan as he bends
over to pick up a piece of wood.
"Here, how about this board?"
Friedlander groans, then laughs
warily as he talks about the
suede whip they are actually
planning to use while perform
ing. "Supposedly it doesn't hurt
but it cracks when it lands,"
Friedlander says. "I'll believe it
when I see it."
"Also, they say that this par
ticular whip leaves red marks,"
says Eagan. Friedlander shoots
him a sidelong glance; he is not
amused.
Flogging details
But director Eagan has to
worry about things much more
important than the mundane
mechanical details involved in
floggings. In choosing to do
Marat/Sade, he willingly took on
a cast of 47, ranging in age from
18 to "over 40," and received
along with it all the headaches
inherent in dealing with such a
large array of loonies.
Set in a mental institution in
early 19th century France, theof

ficial title of the play reads —
The Persecution and Assassina
tion of Jean-Paul Marat as Per
formed by the Inmates of the
Asylum of Charenton Under the
Direction of the Marquis de
Sade. and although it's tempting
to draw a parallel with the
asylum and a typical rehearsal,
Eagan seems to have everything
under control.
A third year graduate student
in drama directing and criti
cism, the 26-year old Eagan
graduated from Boston College
with a concentration in political
science, economics, and English
literature. He did graduate work,
at Oxford in philosophy and En
glish literature, and is now on
his way to completing a PhD. He
chose to present Marat-Sade for
a variety of reasons, many of
which include what he feels is a
special relevance to the Stanford
community. "Peopleareaffected
by their social environment,"
says Eagan. Of the students ai)d
faculty who portray the inmates,
all of whom have to create their
own roles, concoct their own in
sane backgrounds and even
select their own names, Eagan
says"I don't have to fabricate
problems for them; they're al
ieady there. It all stems from
problems in their own lives," he
says.
The play is complex in that all
the characters, including Marat
and Sade, have double roles;
each has to portray a presumably
insane inmate and also an actor
in the plays the Marquis de Sade
puts on inside the institution.
The plot is far too complicated to
reveal in a brief precis; refer to its
lengthy title to obtain the basic
plot summary. "The play is
working on so many levels at
once, you have this extremely
rich and complicated event,"
says Eriedlander. "All the issues
of the French Revolution are de
bated on stage. The play is about
ideas; Marxism, existentialism;
it really is an extraordinarily in
teresting play to do," he says.
'Mental aberration'
Eagan concurs, but notes the
problem of how difficult it is to
get such a varied cast to "explore
in a theatrical environment what
it is like to be oppressed and
stifled to the extent where it
would probably begin to start
some mental abberation in a be
lievable way." He says utilizing
improvisation helped to bring

out some of the possibilities.
The play itself was written in
the early 1960s by German au
thor Peter Weiss, a Jew who left
Germany when WW II broke out
and ended up in Sweden. Ac
cording to Eagan, Weiss chose to
live in the West, and viewed it as
oppressive and insane. The op
pression and various confronta
tions Weiss experienced as a
Jew, first through the war and
then on through the '50s and
'60s, eventually culminated in
the writing of Mamt/Sade.
Eagan characterized the au
thor as a man who was "search
ing." He elaborates: "So what
did he (Weiss) do? He chose to
write a play set in a mental in
stitution — a metaphor of a
world that's insane.
"On one side you have the op
pressed, the inmates, and on the
other side you have the audi
ence, the ones who could afford
to pay for their tickets," those
who in a way "precipitated that
oppression."
"Springing up in the middle
of that metaphor," Eagan con
tinues, "we have two intelligent
responses. There is Marat
(played by Jamie Reid), a pre-
Marxist thinker," who believes
that the "only way to change the
insanity, to bring about a world
where some freedom exists is to
tear down the old, oppressive in
stitutions and people who go
along with them," even if it has
to involve bloodshed. Marat's
basic opinion, according to
Eagan, is that "it's worth it to kill
hundreds to save millions."
'Man of dignity'
Eagan sees Sade as someone
quite different. "Sade represents
a compassionate, concerned
man of dignity. ... He sees the
whole world, not only man, the
whole cosmos, nature, as indif
ferent, unconcerned. That is the
way of the world, and man is es
sentially animalistic, selfish
within his own nature."
The story of the Marquis de
Sade and Jean-Paul Marat will

run-through of Marat/Sade's in
famous flogging scent), and as it
comes crasni ng to a halt, director
Robert Eagan approaches Fried
lander (who portrays that father
of modern Sadism, the Marquis
de Sade) and ex-graduate stu
dent Carol Hunker (who plays
Charlotte Corday, the "woman
with the whip"). Synchronizing
the lashings with Sade's
monologue is the crucial issue

here; the timing isn't right; using
an imaginary instrument of tor
ture just isn't working.
"We can probably get some
thing that approximates a
whip," says Eagan as he bends
over to pick up a piece of wood.
"Here, how about this board?"
Friedlander groans, then laughs
warily as he talks about the
suede whip they are actually
planning to use while perform
ing. "Supposedly it doesn't hurt
but it cracks when it lands,"
Friedlander says. "I'll believe it
when I see it."
"Also, they say that this par
ticular whip leaves red marks,"
says Eagan. Friedlander shoots
him a sidelong glance; he is not
amused.
Flogging details
But director Eagan has to
worry about things much more
important than the mundane
mechanical details involved in
floggings. In choosing to do
Marat/Sade, he willingly took on
a cast of 47, ranging in age from
18 to "over 40," and received
along with it all the headaches
inherent in dealing with such a
large array of loonies.
Set in a mental institution in
early 19th century France, theof

ficial title of the play reads —
The Persecution and Assassina
tion of Jean-Paul Marat as Per
formed by the Inmates of the
Asylum of Charenton Under the
Direction of the Marquis de
Sade. and although it's tempting
to draw a parallel with the
asylum and a typical rehearsal,
Eagan seems to have everything
under control.
A third year graduate student
in drama directing and criti
cism, the 26-year old Eagan
graduated from Boston College
with a concentration in political
science, economics, and English
literature. He did graduate work,
at Oxford in philosophy and En
glish literature, and is now on
his way to completing a PhD. He
chose to present Marat-Sade for
a variety of reasons, many of
which include what he feels is a
special relevance to the Stanford
community. "Peopleareaffected
by their social environment,"
says Eagan. Of the students ai)d
faculty who portray the inmates,
all of whom have to create their
own roles, concoct their own in
sane backgrounds and even
select their own names, Eagan
says"I don't have to fabricate
problems for them; they're al
ieady there. It all stems from
problems in their own lives," he
says.
The play is complex in that all
the characters, including Marat
and Sade, have double roles;
each has to portray a presumably
insane inmate and also an actor
in the plays the Marquis de Sade
puts on inside the institution.
The plot is far too complicated to
reveal in a brief precis; refer to its
lengthy title to obtain the basic
plot summary. "The play is
working on so many levels at
once, you have this extremely
rich and complicated event,"
says Eriedlander. "All the issues
of the French Revolution are de
bated on stage. The play is about
ideas; Marxism, existentialism;
it really is an extraordinarily in
teresting play to do," he says.
'Mental aberration'
Eagan concurs, but notes the
problem of how difficult it is to
get such a varied cast to "explore
in a theatrical environment what
it is like to be oppressed and
stifled to the extent where it
would probably begin to start
some mental abberation in a be
lievable way." He says utilizing
improvisation helped to bring

out some of the possibilities.
The play itself was written in
the early 1960s by German au
thor Peter Weiss, a Jew who left
Germany when WW II broke out
and ended up in Sweden. Ac
cording to Eagan, Weiss chose to
live in the West, and viewed it as
oppressive and insane. The op
pression and various confronta
tions Weiss experienced as a
Jew, first through the war and
then on through the '50s and
'60s, eventually culminated in
the writing of Mamt/Sade.
Eagan characterized the au
thor as a man who was "search
ing." He elaborates: "So what
did he (Weiss) do? He chose to
write a play set in a mental in
stitution — a metaphor of a
world that's insane.
"On one side you have the op
pressed, the inmates, and on the
other side you have the audi
ence, the ones who could afford
to pay for their tickets," those
who in a way "precipitated that
oppression."
"Springing up in the middle
of that metaphor," Eagan con
tinues, "we have two intelligent
responses. There is Marat
(played by Jamie Reid), a pre-
Marxist thinker," who believes
that the "only way to change the
insanity, to bring about a world
where some freedom exists is to
tear down the old, oppressive in
stitutions and people who go
along with them," even if it has
to involve bloodshed. Marat's
basic opinion, according to
Eagan, is that "it's worth it to kill
hundreds to save millions."
'Man of dignity'
Eagan sees Sade as someone
quite different. "Sade represents
a compassionate, concerned
man of dignity. ... He sees the
whole world, not only man, the
whole cosmos, nature, as indif
ferent, unconcerned. That is the
way of the world, and man is es
sentially animalistic, selfish
within his own nature."
The story of the Marquis de
Sade and Jean-Paul Marat will

Memorial Auditorium. With
hopes of involving the viewers,

monologue is the crucial issue

here; the timing isn't right; using
an imaginary instrument of tor
ture just isn't working.
"We can probably get some
thing that approximates a
whip," says Eagan as he bends
over to pick up a piece of wood.
"Here, how about this board?"
Friedlander groans, then laughs
warily as he talks about the
suede whip they are actually
planning to use while perform
ing. "Supposedly it doesn't hurt
but it cracks when it lands,"
Friedlander says. "I'll believe it
when I see it."
"Also, they say that this par
ticular whip leaves red marks,"
says Eagan. Friedlander shoots
him a sidelong glance; he is not
amused.
Flogging details
But director Eagan has to
worry about things much more
important than the mundane
mechanical details involved in
floggings. In choosing to do
Marat/Sade, he willingly took on
a cast of 47, ranging in age from
18 to "over 40," and received
along with it all the headaches
inherent in dealing with such a
large array of loonies.
Set in a mental institution in
early 19th century France, theof

ficial title of the play reads —
The Persecution and Assassina
tion of Jean-Paul Marat as Per
formed by the Inmates of the
Asylum of Charenton Under the
Direction of the Marquis de
Sade. and although it's tempting
to draw a parallel with the
asylum and a typical rehearsal,
Eagan seems to have everything
under control.
A third year graduate student
in drama directing and criti
cism, the 26-year old Eagan
graduated from Boston College
with a concentration in political
science, economics, and English
literature. He did graduate work,
at Oxford in philosophy and En
glish literature, and is now on
his way to completing a PhD. He
chose to present Marat-Sade for
a variety of reasons, many of
which include what he feels is a
special relevance to the Stanford
community. "Peopleareaffected
by their social environment,"
says Eagan. Of the students ai)d
faculty who portray the inmates,
all of whom have to create their
own roles, concoct their own in
sane backgrounds and even
select their own names, Eagan
says"I don't have to fabricate
problems for them; they're al
ieady there. It all stems from
problems in their own lives," he
says.
The play is complex in that all
the characters, including Marat
and Sade, have double roles;
each has to portray a presumably
insane inmate and also an actor
in the plays the Marquis de Sade
puts on inside the institution.
The plot is far too complicated to
reveal in a brief precis; refer to its
lengthy title to obtain the basic
plot summary. "The play is
working on so many levels at
once, you have this extremely
rich and complicated event,"
says Eriedlander. "All the issues
of the French Revolution are de
bated on stage. The play is about
ideas; Marxism, existentialism;
it really is an extraordinarily in
teresting play to do," he says.
'Mental aberration'
Eagan concurs, but notes the
problem of how difficult it is to
get such a varied cast to "explore
in a theatrical environment what
it is like to be oppressed and
stifled to the extent where it
would probably begin to start
some mental abberation in a be
lievable way." He says utilizing
improvisation helped to bring

out some of the possibilities.
The play itself was written in
the early 1960s by German au
thor Peter Weiss, a Jew who left
Germany when WW II broke out
and ended up in Sweden. Ac
cording to Eagan, Weiss chose to
live in the West, and viewed it as
oppressive and insane. The op
pression and various confronta
tions Weiss experienced as a
Jew, first through the war and
then on through the '50s and
'60s, eventually culminated in
the writing of Mamt/Sade.
Eagan characterized the au
thor as a man who was "search
ing." He elaborates: "So what
did he (Weiss) do? He chose to
write a play set in a mental in
stitution — a metaphor of a
world that's insane.
"On one side you have the op
pressed, the inmates, and on the
other side you have the audi
ence, the ones who could afford
to pay for their tickets," those
who in a way "precipitated that
oppression."
"Springing up in the middle
of that metaphor," Eagan con
tinues, "we have two intelligent
responses. There is Marat
(played by Jamie Reid), a pre-
Marxist thinker," who believes
that the "only way to change the
insanity, to bring about a world
where some freedom exists is to
tear down the old, oppressive in
stitutions and people who go
along with them," even if it has
to involve bloodshed. Marat's
basic opinion, according to
Eagan, is that "it's worth it to kill
hundreds to save millions."
'Man of dignity'
Eagan sees Sade as someone
quite different. "Sade represents
a compassionate, concerned
man of dignity. ... He sees the
whole world, not only man, the
whole cosmos, nature, as indif
ferent, unconcerned. That is the
way of the world, and man is es
sentially animalistic, selfish
within his own nature."
The story of the Marquis de
Sade and Jean-Paul Marat will
be presented by the Drama De
partment Feb. 23-26 and March
1 -5 at 8 p.m. in the Scene Shop of
Memorial Auditorium. With
hopes of involving the viewers,
the audience will, for the most
part, be seated on stage, and the
play itself promises to be a com
pelling and involving enough
production to keep them there.

Le Marquis de Sade
Captured in the frame of a wide angle camera
lens, English Prof. Larry Friedlander stands in
the background on the set of "Marat/Sade," a
The light is harsh on the bare
wooden stage platform where
English Prof. Larry Eriedlander
kneels, whimpering. He moans,
gasps, clutches at nothing and as
he cries out, the woman with the
whip stands behind him silently,
her head down, her face hidden
by masses of hanging limp yel
low hair. Again and again she
punctuates each dramatic pause
by lashing Friedlander's back
until he verges on crumbling
into an exhausted, sweaty heap.
His forehead glistens with pers
piration as he struggles to stay
on his knees.
Now we've all daydreamed
about flogging certain nasty pro
fessors who give us Cs when we
deserve As, but this is no fantasy
of revenge; it is the day's first
run-through of Marat/Sade's in
famous flogging scent), and as it
comes crasni ng to a halt, director
Robert Eagan approaches Fried
lander (who portrays that father
of modern Sadism, the Marquis
de Sade) and ex-graduate stu
dent Carol Hunker (who plays
Charlotte Corday, the "woman
with the whip"). Synchronizing
the lashings with Sade's
monologue is the crucial issue

here; the timing isn't right; using
an imaginary instrument of tor
ture just isn't working.
