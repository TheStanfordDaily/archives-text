# S.F. brass assaults Bizet
## 
### Andrew M. Moravcsik 
I can remain silent no longer
about the brass section of the San
Francisco Symphony. If the var
ious squeaks, squawks and acci
dental dissonances in past per
formances have not convinced
the management that something
must be done, Wednesday's per
formance should provide all the
necessary evidence. The section,
especially the French Horns,
was unremmittingly out of tune,
produced a constantly forced
tone and failed to survive a
single movement of the Bizet
Symphony in C without a
cracked note.
I cannot fathom the cause of
this weakness, since the San
Francisco Opera brass (consist
ing of many of the same people)
was magnificent this year, pre
senting an entire Die Walkure
without a scratch on the orchest
ral veneer; 1 shudder to think
what they will do to the Sym
phony's performance of Die
Wolkure in the spring! Fortu
nately, however, a symphony
orchestra is more than a brass
choir, and the rest of the or
chestra performed well.
Young American guest con
ductor Leonard Slatkin chose
the Bizet to begin the evening.
The Symphony in C, written
when the composer was only 17,
is filled with sparkling and
buoyant melodies while
employing all the contrapuntal
and harmonic skills of a mature
master.
Sheer musicality
Slatkin's phrasing, especially
in the strings, was the highlight
of the evening; the delicacy and
sensitivity, the sheer musicality
of many of the phrases were the
best I have heard this season.
Slatkin also maintained an even
balance between the brass (such
as they were) and the strings,
something that had been a prob
lem earlier this vear.
The second movement, an
Adagio, was masterfully hand
led. A yearning, sensuous and
inconspicuously oriental theme
is played in the oboe over a soft
string background (the in
strumentation. key, and rhythm
are similar to the corresponding
movemen' in Scubert's "Great"
C Major Symphony, to be heard
later this season.) Slatkin's ex
pressive phrasing, combined
with the warm and pleasant oboe
timbre, created a few minutes of
magic — a performance of this
movement superior to most re
corded versions on the market
today.
The only interpretive flaw in
Bizet's Symphony was a slight
dearth of the outstanding vivac
ity and confidence mentioned
above, perhaps due to the or
chestra's unfamiliarity with
Maestro Slatkin.
Before the second work, Mir
age by Jacob Druckman, Slatkin
gave an unannounced but en
gaging talk on the subtleties of
this modern composition. Em

phasizing the melodic and
spiritual ties to the French Im
pressionists, he explained that
the piece featured two orchestras
— one on stage and one hidden
in the wings — which build con
current layers of sound.
Slatkin. a composer himself,
showed great, enthusiasm for
Mirage, referring to it as "The
Hello Symphony" (an obvious
reference to Haydn's Farewell
Symphony) since several per
formers come on stage and take
their spots in the orchestra while
the piece is in progress. How
ever, I was not so impressed.
While it is a pastiche of in
teresting ideas, combining, for
example, distinctly Straussian
harmonies with the media of
Ives (The Unanswered Ques
tion), Mirage lacks an integrat
ing musical idea and grew tedi
ous after the interest and novelty
wore off. As for the gimmick of
moving players on and off the
stage, Haydn did it much better
and more importantly, had a
clever reason for doing so;
Druckman's random movement
of a half-dozen players into an
orchestra of 70 was meaning
less.
Controversial masterwork
Brahms' Double Concedo for
Violin and 'Cello has always
been a secondary work, often
forgotten amongst the Romantic
solo concerti, yet it is a
storehouse of beautiful melody,
lush harmony and bold orchest
ration, and in my opinion, it is a
masterwork of the highest qual
ity. Wednesday's performance,
featuring Concertmaster Stuart
Canin and Cellist Lynn Harrell.
lent insight into the causes of
this paradoxical neglect.
Brahms balances the two sol
oists against an entire orchestra
of the same scale used in the four
Brahms symphonies. Unlike ear
lier string concerti, however, the
orchestra does not merely ac
company or mirror the soloists,
but plays an equal role. Added to

the technical difficulties and the
radiant warmth needed to inter
pret the solo passages correctly,
this puts a heavy burden on the
soloists, for they must play for
tissimo to match the orchestra
and yet master the subtleties of
the work. Modern recording
techniques easily achieve a ba
lance and the concerto can be ef
fective in small auditoriums, but
the Opera House — a vast cavern
— merely exaggerates the prob
lem. Hence, the forte passages
sounded forced, while ihe sec
tions where the soloists could af
ford to play softly were beauti
ful.
Weak start
Canin and Harrell began with
the jitters — evidenced by shaky
notes, inexact intonation and a
weak tone in the exposed open
ing passages. Slatkin's first
movement tempo, slightly faster
than usual, didn't help the
struggling soloists.
Despite the weak start, the
duet blended well, helped by
Slatkin's sensitive interpretation
of the orchestral part. This was
especially evident in the An
dante second movement, where
Canin's sweet tone alternated
with the gruff but amiable cello
in a relaxed conversation.
The third movement, a stirring
Vivace non tmppo, found the
soloists warmed up, the initial
nervousness evaporated, al
though the inherent limitations
mentioned above still hampered
the effectiveness of the work.
The audience reacted warmly
and brought the soloists out for
numerous bows at the conclu
sion of the concert.
Next week the Symphony will
again feature Leonard Slatkin,
who will conduct the Ginestra
Concerto for Strings, Beeth
oven's Piano Concerto No. 1 and
the Sibelius Symphony No. 5. I
would recommend this concert
on the strength of Slatkin's fine
performance last Wednesday,
give or take the brass section.

ious squeaks, squawks and acci
dental dissonances in past per
formances have not convinced
the management that something
must be done, Wednesday's per
formance should provide all the
necessary evidence. The section,
especially the French Horns,
was unremmittingly out of tune,
produced a constantly forced
tone and failed to survive a
single movement of the Bizet
Symphony in C without a
cracked note.
I cannot fathom the cause of
this weakness, since the San
Francisco Opera brass (consist
ing of many of the same people)
was magnificent this year, pre
senting an entire Die Walkure
without a scratch on the orchest
ral veneer; 1 shudder to think
what they will do to the Sym
phony's performance of Die
Wolkure in the spring! Fortu
nately, however, a symphony
orchestra is more than a brass
choir, and the rest of the or
chestra performed well.
Young American guest con
ductor Leonard Slatkin chose
the Bizet to begin the evening.
The Symphony in C, written
when the composer was only 17,
is filled with sparkling and
buoyant melodies while
employing all the contrapuntal
and harmonic skills of a mature
master.
Sheer musicality
Slatkin's phrasing, especially
in the strings, was the highlight
of the evening; the delicacy and
sensitivity, the sheer musicality
of many of the phrases were the
best I have heard this season.
Slatkin also maintained an even
balance between the brass (such
as they were) and the strings,
something that had been a prob
lem earlier this vear.
The second movement, an
Adagio, was masterfully hand
led. A yearning, sensuous and
inconspicuously oriental theme
is played in the oboe over a soft
string background (the in
strumentation. key, and rhythm
are similar to the corresponding
movemen' in Scubert's "Great"
C Major Symphony, to be heard
later this season.) Slatkin's ex
pressive phrasing, combined
with the warm and pleasant oboe
timbre, created a few minutes of
magic — a performance of this
movement superior to most re
corded versions on the market
today.
The only interpretive flaw in
Bizet's Symphony was a slight
dearth of the outstanding vivac
ity and confidence mentioned
above, perhaps due to the or
chestra's unfamiliarity with
Maestro Slatkin.
Before the second work, Mir
age by Jacob Druckman, Slatkin
gave an unannounced but en
gaging talk on the subtleties of
this modern composition. Em

phasizing the melodic and
spiritual ties to the French Im
pressionists, he explained that
the piece featured two orchestras
— one on stage and one hidden
in the wings — which build con
current layers of sound.
Slatkin. a composer himself,
showed great, enthusiasm for
Mirage, referring to it as "The
Hello Symphony" (an obvious
reference to Haydn's Farewell
Symphony) since several per
formers come on stage and take
their spots in the orchestra while
the piece is in progress. How
ever, I was not so impressed.
While it is a pastiche of in
teresting ideas, combining, for
example, distinctly Straussian
harmonies with the media of
Ives (The Unanswered Ques
tion), Mirage lacks an integrat
ing musical idea and grew tedi
ous after the interest and novelty
wore off. As for the gimmick of
moving players on and off the
stage, Haydn did it much better
and more importantly, had a
clever reason for doing so;
Druckman's random movement
of a half-dozen players into an
orchestra of 70 was meaning
less.
Controversial masterwork
Brahms' Double Concedo for
Violin and 'Cello has always
been a secondary work, often
forgotten amongst the Romantic
solo concerti, yet it is a
storehouse of beautiful melody,
lush harmony and bold orchest
ration, and in my opinion, it is a
masterwork of the highest qual
ity. Wednesday's performance,
featuring Concertmaster Stuart
Canin and Cellist Lynn Harrell.
lent insight into the causes of
this paradoxical neglect.
Brahms balances the two sol
oists against an entire orchestra
of the same scale used in the four
Brahms symphonies. Unlike ear
lier string concerti, however, the
orchestra does not merely ac
company or mirror the soloists,
but plays an equal role. Added to

the technical difficulties and the
radiant warmth needed to inter
pret the solo passages correctly,
this puts a heavy burden on the
soloists, for they must play for
tissimo to match the orchestra
and yet master the subtleties of
the work. Modern recording
techniques easily achieve a ba
lance and the concerto can be ef
fective in small auditoriums, but
the Opera House — a vast cavern
— merely exaggerates the prob
lem. Hence, the forte passages
sounded forced, while ihe sec
tions where the soloists could af
ford to play softly were beauti
ful.
Weak start
Canin and Harrell began with
the jitters — evidenced by shaky
notes, inexact intonation and a
weak tone in the exposed open
ing passages. Slatkin's first
movement tempo, slightly faster
than usual, didn't help the
struggling soloists.
Despite the weak start, the
duet blended well, helped by
Slatkin's sensitive interpretation
of the orchestral part. This was
especially evident in the An
dante second movement, where
Canin's sweet tone alternated
with the gruff but amiable cello
in a relaxed conversation.
The third movement, a stirring
Vivace non tmppo, found the
soloists warmed up, the initial
nervousness evaporated, al
though the inherent limitations
mentioned above still hampered
the effectiveness of the work.
The audience reacted warmly
and brought the soloists out for
numerous bows at the conclu
sion of the concert.
Next week the Symphony will
again feature Leonard Slatkin,
who will conduct the Ginestra
Concerto for Strings, Beeth
oven's Piano Concerto No. 1 and
the Sibelius Symphony No. 5. I

must be done, Wednesday's per
formance should provide all the
necessary evidence. The section,
especially the French Horns,
was unremmittingly out of tune,
produced a constantly forced
tone and failed to survive a
single movement of the Bizet
Symphony in C without a
cracked note.
I cannot fathom the cause of
this weakness, since the San
Francisco Opera brass (consist
ing of many of the same people)
was magnificent this year, pre
senting an entire Die Walkure
without a scratch on the orchest
ral veneer; 1 shudder to think
what they will do to the Sym
phony's performance of Die
Wolkure in the spring! Fortu
nately, however, a symphony
orchestra is more than a brass
choir, and the rest of the or
chestra performed well.
Young American guest con
ductor Leonard Slatkin chose
the Bizet to begin the evening.
The Symphony in C, written
when the composer was only 17,
is filled with sparkling and
buoyant melodies while
employing all the contrapuntal
and harmonic skills of a mature
master.
Sheer musicality
Slatkin's phrasing, especially
in the strings, was the highlight
of the evening; the delicacy and
sensitivity, the sheer musicality
of many of the phrases were the
best I have heard this season.
Slatkin also maintained an even
balance between the brass (such
as they were) and the strings,
something that had been a prob
lem earlier this vear.
The second movement, an
Adagio, was masterfully hand
led. A yearning, sensuous and
inconspicuously oriental theme
is played in the oboe over a soft
string background (the in
strumentation. key, and rhythm
are similar to the corresponding
movemen' in Scubert's "Great"
C Major Symphony, to be heard
later this season.) Slatkin's ex
pressive phrasing, combined
with the warm and pleasant oboe
timbre, created a few minutes of
magic — a performance of this
movement superior to most re
corded versions on the market
today.
The only interpretive flaw in
Bizet's Symphony was a slight
dearth of the outstanding vivac
ity and confidence mentioned
above, perhaps due to the or
chestra's unfamiliarity with
Maestro Slatkin.
Before the second work, Mir
age by Jacob Druckman, Slatkin
gave an unannounced but en
gaging talk on the subtleties of
this modern composition. Em

phasizing the melodic and
spiritual ties to the French Im
pressionists, he explained that
the piece featured two orchestras
— one on stage and one hidden
in the wings — which build con
current layers of sound.
Slatkin. a composer himself,
showed great, enthusiasm for
Mirage, referring to it as "The
Hello Symphony" (an obvious
reference to Haydn's Farewell
Symphony) since several per
formers come on stage and take
their spots in the orchestra while
the piece is in progress. How
ever, I was not so impressed.
While it is a pastiche of in
teresting ideas, combining, for
example, distinctly Straussian
harmonies with the media of
Ives (The Unanswered Ques
tion), Mirage lacks an integrat
ing musical idea and grew tedi
ous after the interest and novelty
wore off. As for the gimmick of
moving players on and off the
stage, Haydn did it much better
and more importantly, had a
clever reason for doing so;
Druckman's random movement
of a half-dozen players into an
orchestra of 70 was meaning
less.
Controversial masterwork
Brahms' Double Concedo for
Violin and 'Cello has always
been a secondary work, often
forgotten amongst the Romantic
solo concerti, yet it is a
storehouse of beautiful melody,
lush harmony and bold orchest
ration, and in my opinion, it is a
masterwork of the highest qual
ity. Wednesday's performance,
featuring Concertmaster Stuart
Canin and Cellist Lynn Harrell.
lent insight into the causes of
this paradoxical neglect.
Brahms balances the two sol
oists against an entire orchestra
of the same scale used in the four
Brahms symphonies. Unlike ear
lier string concerti, however, the
orchestra does not merely ac
company or mirror the soloists,
but plays an equal role. Added to

the technical difficulties and the
radiant warmth needed to inter
pret the solo passages correctly,
this puts a heavy burden on the
soloists, for they must play for
tissimo to match the orchestra
and yet master the subtleties of
the work. Modern recording
techniques easily achieve a ba
lance and the concerto can be ef
fective in small auditoriums, but
the Opera House — a vast cavern
— merely exaggerates the prob
lem. Hence, the forte passages
sounded forced, while ihe sec
tions where the soloists could af
ford to play softly were beauti
ful.
Weak start
Canin and Harrell began with
the jitters — evidenced by shaky
notes, inexact intonation and a
weak tone in the exposed open
ing passages. Slatkin's first
movement tempo, slightly faster
than usual, didn't help the
struggling soloists.
Despite the weak start, the
duet blended well, helped by
Slatkin's sensitive interpretation
of the orchestral part. This was
especially evident in the An
dante second movement, where
Canin's sweet tone alternated
with the gruff but amiable cello
in a relaxed conversation.
The third movement, a stirring
Vivace non tmppo, found the
soloists warmed up, the initial
nervousness evaporated, al
though the inherent limitations
mentioned above still hampered
the effectiveness of the work.
The audience reacted warmly
and brought the soloists out for
numerous bows at the conclu
sion of the concert.
Next week the Symphony will
again feature Leonard Slatkin,
who will conduct the Ginestra
Concerto for Strings, Beeth
oven's Piano Concerto No. 1 and
the Sibelius Symphony No. 5. I
would recommend this concert
on the strength of Slatkin's fine
performance last Wednesday,
give or take the brass section.
I can remain silent no longer
about the brass section of the San
Francisco Symphony. If the var
ious squeaks, squawks and acci
dental dissonances in past per
formances have not convinced
the management that something
must be done, Wednesday's per
formance should provide all the
necessary evidence. The section,
