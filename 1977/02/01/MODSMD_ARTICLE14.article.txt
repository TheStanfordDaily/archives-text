# Highly acclaimed company to appear
## Eliot Feld Ballet starts tonight 
### Sally Ourieff 
The Eliot Feld Ballet begins three nights
of performances this evening in Memorial
Auditorium. Acclaimed as one of the most
important new additions to the dance
world, this young company has been con
tinuously applauded and hailed since its
beginning in 1974. Feld himself has been
bestowed with praise by critics all across
the country, including Clive Barnes (New
York Times) who claims that Feld is "the
most talented classic choreographer of his
generation anywhere in the world."
Feld was introduced into his dance career
at the age of 12 when he began performing
in a number of musical productions. He
continued, joining the casts of such Broad
ways shows as the popular West Side Story
and Fiddler on the Roof. It was during his
years as a member of American Ballet Thea
ter that, in 1967, he created his first ballet.

Harbinger. Since then he has choreog
raphed 23 ballets for companies all over the
world.
His work now is devoted to the 16 mem
bers of his own company who perform per
manently in New York City's Public Theater
when not on tour. They were founded offi
cially as the resident dancc company of the
New York Shakespeare Festival. Unlike
most young groups, they were saved from
many of the early financial struggles by the
aid of the Rockefeller Foundation. Feld was
offered the chance to begin his own com
pany, and in accepting, was granted
$225,000 with which to begin his ventures.
That first season the house was sold out at
103 per cent capacity and the performances
were extended an additional two weeks.
From that point on v the enthusiasm for
Feld's company has only kept growing.
Although his company is young, Feld has

remarked that many of the dancers them
selves are actually in their prime. Christine
Sarry, previously a principle of American
Ballet Theater, is 27; an age that is usually
considered the height of a dancer's career.
Other members are also in their late 2()s and
Feld himself is 31. Their experience adds
that much more to the success of Feld's
works £nd to the success of the company as
a whole.
It is a company that i: just beginning to
explore the talents of hot h its choreographer
and its dancers. The future can not help but
continue to be marked by Feld's genius, and
his works stamped by his distinct qualities.
In having his own company Feld has the
freedom to create; in having Feld. the dan
cers have the freedom to express themselves
through some of the greatest ballets of the
time.
