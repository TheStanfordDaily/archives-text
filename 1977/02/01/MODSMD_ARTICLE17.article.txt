Vance: human rights crucial
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday that violations of human rights
are of "fundamental importance" to the United
States, but he does not "intend to be strident or
polemical" in criticizing the practices of other
countries.
In a cautious discussion of the subject, the
secretary said, "We will speak frankly about in
justiceat home or abroad." Hut he added that the
issue is "very complex . . . we will not speak out
in every case."
Vance, making the remarks in his first formal
news conference since assuming office a little
over a week ago, also strongly attacked the white
supremacist government in Rhodesia.
Heading from a prepared statement, the sec
retary said Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith
must realize "that under no circumstances can
they count on any American support to prevent
majority rule."
The secretary also signalled a shift in the
American attitude toward Cuba. "I don't want to
set any preconditions" on normalizing relations
between Washington and Havana, he said.
Vance added that he felt criticism of Soviet
human rights violations will not damage U.S.-
Russian relations, but avoided endorsing an ear
lier State Department complaint about Russian
treatment of dissident leader Andrei Sakharov.
Also, after a 2'/2-hour meeting yesterday bet
ween Vance and Panamanian Foreign Minister
Aquilino Hoyd, the U.S. and Panama pledged to
make a "sustained and continuous effort to
reach early agreement on a new Panama Canal
treaty."
Treaty negotiations were suspended in mid-
December, but Hoyd and Vance agreed to resume
talles Feb. 10 in Panama.
Hoyd told reporters after the meeting he con
siders the year 2000 to be "reasonable" expira
tion date for a new treaty. After that date, he said,
"Panama will take control of the canal and will
defend the canal."
The question of whether Panama will have
Complete jurisdiction over the canal once the

new treaty expires has been one of the key issues
in the negotiations. The two countries have been
searching for a formula under which all nations
would be assured non-discrirninatory access to
the canal without impeding Panamanian
sovereignty.
Cold blitz death toll reaches 75
The severe cold blitz that has left at least 7 5
Americans dead and sliced deeply into natural
gas supplies has forced millions of Americans
off the job or out of school.
Thousands of schools, particularly in the
Northeast, were closed yesterday as state offi
cials fought to preserve diminishing gas
supplies.
The gas shortage forced the layoff of more than
1.5 million workers in areas where plants and
busi nesses were ordered to close or reduce oper
ations so available heating fuel could be used tor
homes in the Northeast and Midwest.
At least 11 states ordered emergency measures
to deal with the weather and energy crisis.
In Washington, meanwhile, Congress worked
on emergency legislation proposed by President
Jimmy Carter to redistribute natural gas to those
areas that need it most.
The natural gas shortage has so impacted in
dustry — there have been one million layoffs in
Ohio alone — that state unemployment offices
stayed open over the weekend to process appli
cations.
The heavy demand for unemployment com
pensation due to weather-related layoffs will put
new pressure on state unemployment compen
sation funds that are already $3.6 bil lion in debt,
the government said.
Japan to be consulted on policy
Tokyo — Vice President Walter Mondale
pledged yesterday that the United States will
consult with Japan on major policy changes and
avoid the sudden shocks which occasionally
strained U.S.-Japanese relations during the
Nixon and Ford administrations.

At a dinner following private talks with
Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, Mon
dale assured Fukuda that President Jimmy Car
ter was "resolved to consult closely with your
government on all matters of mutual interest,
including stable growth of the international
economy."
The vice president said there also would be
close consultation with Japan on "creative and
equitable approaches to global economic prob
lems, reconciliation with former adversaries, as
well as preserving peace in Asia."
The phrase "reconciliation with former ad
versaries" was seen as diplomatic shorthand for
normalization of relations with Vietnam and
improved ties with China.
In his talks with Western European leaders as
well as in Japan, the vice president has been
stressing the view that the stronger economies of
Japan, West Germany and the United States need
to take the lead in spurring international
economic recovery.
According to American officials, the first item
Mondale brought up with Fukuda was the
pledge that there would be no more "shocks"
resulting from surprise policy changes underta
ken without advance consultation with the
Japanese.
Weather hurts workers' funds
Washington — State unemployment insur
ance funds, already $3.6 billion in debt, face a
new crunch from growing numbers of workers
laid off across the country because of the severe
winter weather and fuel shortages.
Labor Department officials said yesterday
lengthening lines at unemployment offices will
cost the states millions of dollars in extra be
nefits for the jobless. There are estimates that as
many as 1.5 million persons have been laid off
because of the fuel shortages.
Even before the new crisis 19 states, the Dis
trict of Columbia and Puerto Rico already owed
the federal government $3.6 billion. The money
had been borrowed over the past two years to
keep their funds, drained by the recession, from

going bankrupt.
Employers, who finance the unemployment
insurance system through a payroll tax, already
lace a sharply higher tax burden this year under
laws passed in 1976 to replenish the funds.
Employers paid $8 billion in state and federal
jobless taxes in fiscal 1976. This is expected to
increase to $11.5 billion in the current 112 iscal year
and $15 billion in fiscal 1978.
More than 500,000 workers currently are
drawing benefits under this program, which is
scheduled to expire March 31. However, Con
gress is expected to extend it.
Ex-Stanford coach Ralston resigns
Denver — John Ralston, who once responded
to a Denver Broncos player revolt by saying he'd
never quit as head coach of the National Football
League team, resigned yesterday. Ralston had
been head coach at Stanford for nine years, from
1963 to 1972.
The 49-year-old Ralston guided the Broncos to
a 9-5 record last season, the best in the club's
17-year history. But he failed to deliver the
playoff team he promised the fans when he took
the job early in 1972. In five years under him,
Denver was 34-33-3.
"With six weeks of working under the Denver
Broncos reorganizational structure, I believe it is
in the best interests of all concerned if 1 relin
quish my duties of head coach effective im
mediately," said the former Stanford coach.
"This will allow new General Manager Fred
Uehrke to bring in a coach of his own choosing."
Gehrke replaced Ralston as general manager
last December, although Ralston said he would
remain as head coach.
Ralston came to Denver after two successive
Stanford Rose Bowl victories. In nine seasons at
Stanford, he captured two Pacific-8 Conference
titles and compiled a 54-36-3 record.
