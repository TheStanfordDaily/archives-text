# Benefits outweigh risks
## DNA research defended 
### Marc Strassman 
Biochemistry Prof. David Hogness argued last night that
the dangers to society from recombinant DNA research are
considerably less than the chances of being hit by lightn
ing. Hogness spoke at the first of two public meetings on
the controversial subject before an overflow audience of
500 at the new Sherman Fairchild Center Auditorium in
the Medical Center.
Hogness explained the basic principles involved in this
new type of biological research, which consists of the
removing, isolating and sometimes placing in new cells
separate segments of DNA, the genetic material that de
termines all the characteristics of living organisms, in
cluding humans.
Throughout his talk, Hogness minimized the possible
dangers from recombinant DNA research.
His final slide reproduced a recent cover of New Times
magazine with a "snake, presumably venomous" emerg
ing out of a double helix of DNA being put together by
white-coated scientists. Hogness said that the picture
"over-emphasized imagined hazards."
Hogness said that "as far as anyone knows, to date no
one has been hurt" by recombinant DNA research. Fears
about possible disasters in this area, he said, are "not
based on fact; they're based on imagined scenarios."
He supported these contentions by arguing that the E.
coli bacterium K-12. specially developed recipient cell
used in most recombinant research, is no longer capable of
"surviving in the human gut" from which it was first
removed more than 50 years ago. He also said even in

cases where recombinant cells are capable of producing
toxins, they may not be pathological in their effects.
Hogness sought to retute the argument that recombin
ant DNA research should not be allowed because mutation
of cells through recombinant processes has never occur
red before. He said it had never been done before in
laboratories, but argued that the necessary enzymes and
vectors are present in nature and that by the laws of proba
bility such genetic transformations are most probably "an
everyday event."
Hogness said that "although the hazards are specula
tive, federal standards regulating the research are very
tight." He said the level of containment required for many
such experiments are as strict as those regulating the
handling of anthrax and diphtheria bacteria. He said no
research on human DNA is presently being conducted
because of current restrictions on the research.
Hogness spoke of two types of possible benefits to be
derived from recombinant DNA research. The first type,
which he called "non-speculative stuff," involves the use
of E. coli K-12 as "factories for insulin." He said it would
take "two or three years" of research to create these biolog
ical factories.
The second type of benefit Hogness called "specula
tive" and gave as an example of it inserting genes into
bacteria that would enable plants to get nitrogen, an essen
tial nutrient, directly from the air rather than from fertiliz
ers. He said because the mechanisms of such a process
remain unknown, it is not possible to say how long it
would be before such transformations would be possible.

red before. He said it had never been done before in
laboratories, but argued that the necessary enzymes and
vectors are present in nature and that by the laws of proba
bility such genetic transformations are most probably "an
everyday event."
Hogness said that "although the hazards are specula
tive, federal standards regulating the research are very
tight." He said the level of containment required for many
such experiments are as strict as those regulating the
handling of anthrax and diphtheria bacteria. He said no
research on human DNA is presently being conducted
because of current restrictions on the research.
Hogness spoke of two types of possible benefits to be
derived from recombinant DNA research. The first type,
which he called "non-speculative stuff," involves the use
of E. coli K-12 as "factories for insulin." He said it would
take "two or three years" of research to create these biolog
ical factories.
The second type of benefit Hogness called "specula
tive" and gave as an example of it inserting genes into
bacteria that would enable plants to get nitrogen, an essen
tial nutrient, directly from the air rather than from fertiliz
ers. He said because the mechanisms of such a process
remain unknown, it is not possible to say how long it
would be before such transformations would be possible.

Barbara Babcock, an associate professor at the Law School, is awaiting
the decision on her appointment as head of the civil division of the U.S.
Justice Department.
Biochemistry Prof. David Hogness argued last night that
the dangers to society from recombinant DNA research are
considerably less than the chances of being hit by lightn
ing. Hogness spoke at the first of two public meetings on
the controversial subject before an overflow audience of
500 at the new Sherman Fairchild Center Auditorium in
the Medical Center.
Hogness explained the basic principles involved in this
new type of biological research, which consists of the
removing, isolating and sometimes placing in new cells
separate segments of DNA, the genetic material that de
termines all the characteristics of living organisms, in
cluding humans.
Throughout his talk, Hogness minimized the possible
dangers from recombinant DNA research.
His final slide reproduced a recent cover of New Times
magazine with a "snake, presumably venomous" emerg
ing out of a double helix of DNA being put together by
white-coated scientists. Hogness said that the picture
"over-emphasized imagined hazards."
Hogness said that "as far as anyone knows, to date no
one has been hurt" by recombinant DNA research. Fears
about possible disasters in this area, he said, are "not
based on fact; they're based on imagined scenarios."
He supported these contentions by arguing that the E.
coli bacterium K-12. specially developed recipient cell
used in most recombinant research, is no longer capable of
"surviving in the human gut" from which it was first
removed more than 50 years ago. He also said even in

cases where recombinant cells are capable of producing
toxins, they may not be pathological in their effects.
Hogness sought to retute the argument that recombin
ant DNA research should not be allowed because mutation
of cells through recombinant processes has never occur
red before. He said it had never been done before in
laboratories, but argued that the necessary enzymes and
vectors are present in nature and that by the laws of proba
bility such genetic transformations are most probably "an
everyday event."
