Whatever happened to linen
sheets, silver quarters and the
old lead pencil?
If you lament the passing of
the well-made, 100 percent pure
product, take heart in the preser
vation of one relic that has not
changed, over the years, in form
or substance: the fine old black
record.
And I mean old. The phonog
raph was invented at least as far
back as 1877. Since then, what
ever else has changed, the record
has remained a crude mechani
cal object.
Even if you point pridefully to
your Class G amplifier, Heil
effect woofers, infared wireless
headphones, the joke is on you.
For, the better the rest of your
stereo equipment, the more eas
ily you hear the ticks and pops
which arise from the records.
Records require constant care.
It's a good idea to store records in

their sleeves and liners, standing
on edge so the records don't
warp. Modern cartridges have
extended record life dramati
cally with their low tracking
forces.
If the record is dirty, friction
increases, scrubbing away the
grooves gradually. The dirt can
also become welded to the
groove by the temperatures and
forces that develop as a record is
played.
So it's important to clean a re
cord before you play it — each
time. What makes this surpris
ingly hard is that records tend to
build up a static charge which
causes dirt already there to cling
to the record, and also attracts
more dust from the atmosphere.
Scrubbing with a cloth just
builds up more static. Recogniz
ing this, manufacturers have
come out with many devices to
do the cleaning job, but they're
not all equally good.
Many people swear by the
Discwasher ($l5), a highly ad
vertised brush used along with
that company's fluid. This does a
good job of removing dirt, but
the fluid is over-priced, and it
isn't really a good idea to apply
liquid to any record; it can turn
dirt to mud and make for perma
nently spluttering surfaces.
A cheaper ($6) device is the
Watts Preener, which works well
if something can be done about
the static charge. Expensive de
vices are available to deal with
static. One is the Zerostat "ray
gun" ($25), which shoots ions at
the record to neutralize charges.
This gadget is safe and (seem
ingly) effective.
A much more inexpensive
way of reducing static is to
breathe lightly on a record before
and after you clean it. This de
posits a molecular layer of mois
ture, and helps the static to leak
away without ill effect (let the
wetness dissipate before playing
the record).
Finally, you can buy arms
which track the record — the
Watts Dust Bug, and fancier im
itations — to pick up the dust
attracted as it is playing.
For a few years, classical
music lovers found that im
ported recordings from DGG and
Philips were superior in quality
to American-made records, but
this is less and less true as the
European production quotas go
up. To their credit, U.S. record
factories have been improving
their product some, but they still
have to do better.
As we cling to the poor old
record, electronics will step in
more and more to help. This
month SAE introduced a $200
black box, a "smart filter" which
can remove clicks and pops
without affecting the music.
It will also be possible to en
code records with a deliberately
compressed dynamic range. Cir
cuitry in a receiver would then
expand the range again, reduc
ing noise as it did so.
For now though, it will help us
to be especially careful with the
records we own and about the
ones we buy. Remember that
every time you buy a record, you
are buying an antique — treat it
accordingly!-

Records require constant care.
It's a good idea to store records in

their sleeves and liners, standing
on edge so the records don't
warp. Modern cartridges have
extended record life dramati
cally with their low tracking
forces.
If the record is dirty, friction
increases, scrubbing away the
grooves gradually. The dirt can
also become welded to the
groove by the temperatures and
forces that develop as a record is
played.
So it's important to clean a re
cord before you play it — each
time. What makes this surpris
ingly hard is that records tend to
build up a static charge which
causes dirt already there to cling
to the record, and also attracts
more dust from the atmosphere.
Scrubbing with a cloth just
builds up more static. Recogniz
ing this, manufacturers have
come out with many devices to
do the cleaning job, but they're
not all equally good.
Many people swear by the
Discwasher ($l5), a highly ad
vertised brush used along with
that company's fluid. This does a
good job of removing dirt, but
the fluid is over-priced, and it
isn't really a good idea to apply
liquid to any record; it can turn
dirt to mud and make for perma
nently spluttering surfaces.
A cheaper ($6) device is the
Watts Preener, which works well
if something can be done about
the static charge. Expensive de
vices are available to deal with
static. One is the Zerostat "ray
gun" ($25), which shoots ions at
the record to neutralize charges.
This gadget is safe and (seem
ingly) effective.
A much more inexpensive
way of reducing static is to
breathe lightly on a record before
and after you clean it. This de
posits a molecular layer of mois
ture, and helps the static to leak
away without ill effect (let the
wetness dissipate before playing
the record).
Finally, you can buy arms
which track the record — the
Watts Dust Bug, and fancier im
itations — to pick up the dust
attracted as it is playing.
For a few years, classical
music lovers found that im
ported recordings from DGG and
Philips were superior in quality
to American-made records, but
this is less and less true as the
European production quotas go
up. To their credit, U.S. record
factories have been improving
their product some, but they still
have to do better.
As we cling to the poor old
record, electronics will step in
more and more to help. This
month SAE introduced a $200
black box, a "smart filter" which
can remove clicks and pops
without affecting the music.
It will also be possible to en
code records with a deliberately
compressed dynamic range. Cir
cuitry in a receiver would then
expand the range again, reduc
ing noise as it did so.
For now though, it will help us
to be especially careful with the
records we own and about the
ones we buy. Remember that
every time you buy a record, you
are buying an antique — treat it
accordingly!-
Whatever happened to linen
sheets, silver quarters and the
old lead pencil?
If you lament the passing of
the well-made, 100 percent pure
product, take heart in the preser
vation of one relic that has not
changed, over the years, in form
