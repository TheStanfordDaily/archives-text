The theft of stereo equipment
is not a pressing problem on
campus according to Depart
ment of Public Safety Captain
Raoul Niemever.
"There are not a lot of thefts of
stereo equipment. Students are a
lot more alert; they call in when
there is a suspicious person,"
said Niemeyer.
Small items such as jewelry
and cash are the most common
items taken from dorm rooms.
Unlocked rooms are the main
targets.
According to Niemeyer,
"Most dorm thefts are from
rooms with doors that are un
locked. If someone is inside they
just say the're looking for Joe
Blow. They've been mostly tak
ing small stuff."
Theft of car stereos, tape decks
and Citizen Band radios is a
more frequent occurrence. But
this year there have not been
many cases of this type of theft.
According to Department of
Public Safety statistics, thefts
and burglaries from vehicles de
creased from 218 in 1975 to 155
in 1976. If the car is completely
locked and is entered to remove
the contents, a burglary has been
committed. If the car is un
locked. the action is considered
a theft.
"It's been very slow." said
Niemeyer. "About one year ago
we used to have 'car clouts'
(thieve.,) taking tape decks and
CBs from cars in the parking lots,
but not recently."
Niemeyer cautioned, how
ever, that "one (thief) will hit an
area and work it to death."
It is practically impossible to
prevent theft of audio equipment
from a car, but there are many
ways to make it more difficult.
Installing theaudiounit in the
dash board is the most often re
commended method. It is also
the most expensive.
Using a slide mount and tak
ing the equipment out when
leaving the car parked is a sure
way to avoid theft. But placing it
in the trunk is only slightly safer
than leaving the unit inside the
car.
Since many thieves search
parking lots for cars with visible
stereos, tape decks and citizen
band radios, hiding the equip
ment in the glove compartment,
under the seat or in the trunk
provides some measure of safety.
But tell-tale speakers, wires or

antennae may defeat the most
ingenious concealment scheme.
All audio equipment should
be marked with the driver's
license number. Should the unit
be stolen, law enforcement offic
ers can then easily obtain owner
ship information while in the
field. Other identification num
bers. such as Social Security
numbers, are not as easily avail
able to the police officer on the
street and should not be used.
