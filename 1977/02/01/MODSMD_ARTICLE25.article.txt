# FM radio round-up

### Andy Barkins 
If you are the type of person
who would wear a cowboy hat
on the Hawaii charter, if your
favorite album is Mel Torme's
Greatest Hits, or if you are heav
ily into: (choose one)
1) stomping on your RA while
wearing golf shoes,
2) eating peanut butter and
ketchup sandwiches,
3) sado-masochism,
4) Darvon,
5) the Electric Prunes,
then the Bay Area has a radio
station for you. The problem is, if
you don't have a 30-foot an
tenna. you can't always get the
station you want.
This review then, will concen
trate only on those stations
which students can easily re
ceive on their Radio Shack stereo
systems. For the sake of con
venience, we will start our trip
down the FM band from the top.
The first station of interest is
KSOL at 107.7 on the dial. It is a
soul station which airs lesser
known songs as well as West
Coast talent. Some of the music
is trash, byt at least the DJs don't
offend.
Moving on, we come to KARA
at 105.7. This is your basic com
mercial hit station which plays a
variety of rock and pop, old and
new.
The next station down the line
is kSFX, at 103.7. A good boogie
and soul station. KSFX plays
some of the best music around.
The tempo is faster than
KSOL, and if you're into danc
ing, this is the station for you.

Sliding down to 98.9, we pick
up KCBS. This station
specializes in soft, light, pop
music from artists like Joni
Mitchell. James Taylor and
Stevie Wonder, played in 15-20
minute sets. A great station if
you want to "mellow out."
At 98.5 on the FM wavelength
we move into some hard rock
with San Jose's KOME. This sta
tion puts out an interesting con
glomeration of tunes, ranging

from acid-rock to blues, to light
pop with jazz overtones. The DJs
sometimes seem totally burnt
out, and occasionally throw in
low quality acid-rock. On the
whole though, KOME plays
good music.

but takes chances on obscure
songs by unknown artists. You'll

down the FM band from the top.
The first station of interest is
KSOL at 107.7 on the dial. It is a
soul station which airs lesser
known songs as well as West
Coast talent. Some of the music
is trash, byt at least the DJs don't
offend.
Moving on, we come to KARA
at 105.7. This is your basic com
mercial hit station which plays a
variety of rock and pop, old and
new.
The next station down the line
is kSFX, at 103.7. A good boogie
and soul station. KSFX plays
some of the best music around.
The tempo is faster than
KSOL, and if you're into danc
ing, this is the station for you.

Sliding down to 98.9, we pick
up KCBS. This station
specializes in soft, light, pop
music from artists like Joni
Mitchell. James Taylor and
Stevie Wonder, played in 15-20
minute sets. A great station if
you want to "mellow out."
At 98.5 on the FM wavelength
we move into some hard rock
with San Jose's KOME. This sta
tion puts out an interesting con
glomeration of tunes, ranging

from acid-rock to blues, to light
pop with jazz overtones. The DJs
sometimes seem totally burnt
out, and occasionally throw in
low quality acid-rock. On the
whole though, KOME plays
good music.
