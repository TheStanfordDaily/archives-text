## Discs Four new albums explode myths, reveal Mr.Strychnine, and more Hejira Joni Mitchell 
### Kent Drummond 
Do you know what "hejira"
means? Do you care? Neither did
1 until I learned it was the title of
Joni Mitchell's latest album.
Remembering Joni's ruthless in
sistence on the importance of
symbolism. 1 immediatelv looked

it up in my dictionary of
Nomadic dialects (alias Rolling
Stone) and read "hejira: a flight
from danger."
And so it is. From what
"danger" is Mitchell fleeing?
Probably something called "The
Hissing of Summer Lawns."
Where is she headed? To a fuller
maturity, and probably her best
album yet.

Actually, any questions of de
parture or arrival are immaterial
here. The point is that Mitchell is
travaling, expressing in song the
people and experiences so real to
her and to us. Obviously the
journey is one of life, and the
conceit is developed as ingenui
ously and as poetically as any
thing you'd find in Spenser. In
Hejira you'll find coyotes,

crows, old men who sing the
blues, and musty motel rooms.
There are some moments of
reflection, but only to draw
meaning from the myriad ex
periences of travel. Mitchell em
phasizes forward motion — the
importance of forgetting un
pleasant times and moving on to
brighter, happier days ahead.
Mitchell's optimism is only
one reason why this album is so
enjoyable. Another is the way
she chooses to present herself:
not too inaccessible (as many
thought she was in "Summer
Lawns"), yet not prostituting
herself a la "Miles of Aisles."
This sense of moderation brings
both the artist and her listeners
to a new level of awareness.
Now, with a song like "A
Strange Boy" (in my opinion the
best cut of the album), the imag
ery is personalized enough to
make it unique, but not so intui
tive that we cannot understand
it. "Amelia" lets us perceive
only so much, both lyrically and
musically: the rest of the song
remains a mystery. Look at this
album cover: a highway
superimposed on the artist her
self. By traveling it we can un
derstand her and even ourselves,
but there will always be that dis
tance up ahead into which we
cannot see.
Mitchell's unique instrumen
tation hasn't changed in several
albums, nor is there any reason
why it should. Joni's voice, like
her guitar, is ephemeral, fading
into the distance like those white
lines on the freeway. If you're
hoping to hum any of the tunes
on this album, forget it. Mitchell
will never be that accessible.
As always, Joni Mitchell is a
drug. Her music is addicting, be
cause it entices one into a world
far better than this one. even if it
is unreal. She is a poetess as well
as a musician, and the new sense
of elegance she achieves in Hej
ira reinforces her position as one
of the most influential artists in
rock today.

best cut of the album), the imag
ery is personalized enough to
make it unique, but not so intui
tive that we cannot understand
it. "Amelia" lets us perceive
only so much, both lyrically and
musically: the rest of the song
remains a mystery. Look at this
album cover: a highway
superimposed on the artist her
self. By traveling it we can un
derstand her and even ourselves,
but there will always be that dis
tance up ahead into which we
cannot see.
Mitchell's unique instrumen
tation hasn't changed in several
albums, nor is there any reason
why it should. Joni's voice, like
her guitar, is ephemeral, fading
into the distance like those white
lines on the freeway. If you're
hoping to hum any of the tunes
on this album, forget it. Mitchell
will never be that accessible.
As always, Joni Mitchell is a
drug. Her music is addicting, be
cause it entices one into a world
far better than this one. even if it
is unreal. She is a poetess as well
as a musician, and the new sense
of elegance she achieves in Hej
ira reinforces her position as one
of the most influential artists in
rock today.

Do you know what "hejira"
means? Do you care? Neither did
1 until I learned it was the title of
Joni Mitchell's latest album.
Remembering Joni's ruthless in
sistence on the importance of
symbolism. 1 immediatelv looked

it up in my dictionary of
Nomadic dialects (alias Rolling
Stone) and read "hejira: a flight
from danger."
And so it is. From what
"danger" is Mitchell fleeing?
Probably something called "The
Hissing of Summer Lawns."
Where is she headed? To a fuller
maturity, and probably her best
album yet.

Actually, any questions of de
parture or arrival are immaterial
here. The point is that Mitchell is
travaling, expressing in song the
people and experiences so real to
her and to us. Obviously the
journey is one of life, and the
conceit is developed as ingenui
ously and as poetically as any
thing you'd find in Spenser. In
Hejira you'll find coyotes,

crows, old men who sing the
blues, and musty motel rooms.
There are some moments of
reflection, but only to draw
meaning from the myriad ex
periences of travel. Mitchell em
phasizes forward motion — the
importance of forgetting un
pleasant times and moving on to
brighter, happier days ahead.
Mitchell's optimism is only
one reason why this album is so
enjoyable. Another is the way
she chooses to present herself:
not too inaccessible (as many
thought she was in "Summer
Lawns"), yet not prostituting
herself a la "Miles of Aisles."
This sense of moderation brings
both the artist and her listeners
to a new level of awareness.
Now, with a song like "A
Strange Boy" (in my opinion the
best cut of the album), the imag
ery is personalized enough to
make it unique, but not so intui

it. "Amelia" lets us perceive
