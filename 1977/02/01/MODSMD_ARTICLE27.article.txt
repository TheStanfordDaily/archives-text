# Free For All Ted Nugent
## 
### Kent Drummond 
Somewhere amidst the
heavy-metal maelstrom of Ted
Nugent's Free For All album ap
pears the aphorism "When in
doubt/I whip it out." If you're in
doubt, whip out Nugent's latest

album, and brace yourself for the
most savage, brutal rock 'n roll
music available today.
You remember Ted Nugent.
He's the guy who sings and acts
just like those little white rats we
used to inject with strychnine in
science class. Somewhere along
the way, that happened to Ted
and he hasn't come down yet â€”
maybe that's why he sounds too
loud even when the volume is on
"0."
And Free For All will solidify
Nugent's image of the wild man
of rock. The formula for each cut
is simple, even monotonous:
begin with a stark riff, add a
drumbeat that would register 4.2
on the Richter scale, then com
plete it with Nugent's raspy
voice, reminiscent of presuma
bly happier days on the streets of
Detroit.
Lyrics are crude, graphic, in
evitably horny, but unquestion
ably effective. The title cut fills
this recipe perfectly, and is
hence the best song on the al
bum.
Others that make this album
Nugent's best include "Turn it
Up" (Do we have to?) and "Light
My Way," whose chord progres
sions resemble those of "Hey
Baby," the best cut from his pre
vious album.
In "Together," Nugent tries to
pull off an acoustic number and
is painfully out of his element.
That's the only dull moment in
this collection of rock-out songs
which leave one exhausted upon
their completion.
Forget Kiss. Forget Bowie. Ted
Nugent is one of the few rock
artists remaining whom you
don't have to see to appreciate.
His message is no-nonsense
acid-rock, and if there's an
energy crisis, he certainly hasn't
heard about it.
Most importantly, his music is
written for people who are frus
trated. Since that includes most
of us (to one extent or another).
Free For All is clearly worth in
vestigating.
