# Hotel California Eagles

### Bill Larkins Kevin Marks 
With their first four albums
the Eagles brought Los
Angeles-based country rock to
its apex. Traceable themes were
the charms and evils of women;
love, hopeless and otherwise;
fast-paced postadolescence; and
foremost, the myth of the West,
of California in particular.
The Eagles depicted Southern
California as the last frontier, the
ultimate roaming ground for re
stless youth in search of both ful
fillment and escape. Between
the Santa Monica Freeway and
Winslow, Ariz, lay the mecca for
latter-day cowboys, the auto
mated, automotive West, where
we could still glide through
orange dusks and dawns with

the windows rolled down. This
vision was unabashedly roman
tic.
Hotel California, the Eagles
fifth album, reexamines the
myth of the West and explodes
it. The album is an anomaly.
Only the single, "New Kid in
Town," carries the Eagles'
trademark harmonies, their sa
lient commercial feature.
The album's opener. "Hotel
California," and"The Last Re
sort," the fitting final number,
hold the album together themat
ically and overshadow what in
tervenes.
California is no longer treated
respectfully as an aging lover
who, regardless of her faults, has
been generous to her suitors
("Hollywood Waltz" from "One
of These Nights"). No, her now
glaring faults cannot be over
looked anymore. "Her mind is
Tiffany-twisted, she got the
Mercedes bends."
The 1970s have cheapened the
character of our trusty bed part
ner and, worse yet, we're stuck
with her: "You can check out
anytime you like/ But you can
never leave." "Check out," in the
lexicon of Eagles' buddy Jackson
Browne, means commit suicide.
Now that the dream is over,
what to do? There remains a
"Last Resort," a hymn, ambiti
ous in scope, to the exploration
and exploitation of the West.
The Eagles conclude that once
we have bumped into the Pacific
and have tainted everything in
our tracks, we must make the
best of what we have wrought.
"There is no more new frontier/
We have got to make it here."
The optimism reflected by this
decision to stay with the tired
lover counters the dim note with
which "Hotel" commences.
Oh yes. Joe Walsh. In case you
pondered the effect of his joining
the Eagles, none is evident.
Messrs. Frey and Co. have as
similated and effaced him. His
quiet "Pretty Maids All in a
Row" sounds like typical old
Walsh material, with overdubs
of Eagles harmony.
The execution of Hotel
California is excellent. If only
because of two songs. Hotel
California is a significant album
for the Eagles and California
spirits alike.
