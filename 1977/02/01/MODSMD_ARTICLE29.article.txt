# Tejas Z.Z. Top
## 
### Bill Larkins 
The group that brought you
livestock on stage and inspired
millions of beer-drinking, hell
raising teenage boys to get
downtown and find some
"Tush," has now brought you
Tejas.
In the Z.Z. Top tradition. Tejas
is a raucous, raunchy and revolt
ing album. After a few agonizing
listens, I wonder how this trio
managed to set the record for the
largest grossing world tour in
rock history.
Z.Z.'s ieader. Billy Gibbons

(guitar and vocals), Dusty Hill
(bass and vocals), and drummer
Frank Beard have cranked out
yet another tasteless collection
of 10 hard-driving metallic roc
kers. The sentiments conveyed
and the musical expression
thereof uniformly lack sophisti
cation, although their crudity is
unparalleled.
After the opener. "It's Only

Love," has thumped along for a
few minutes, the subject matter
gets much more interesting in
"Arrested for Driving While
Blind." Whether Wild Turkey or
social disease precipitated this
blindness remains unclear at the
song's conclusion.
Pandering to American fasci
nation with the satanic, "El Di
ablo" dabbles in peyote lore a la

Castaneda. In all fairness to Z.Z.,
this cut merits praise for its ap
pealing chord changes and
stands out as the album's
strongest composition.
But immediately following
the devil. "Snappy kakkie"
plunges into thinly veiled allu
sions to various aspects of
human anatomy, with the em
phasis on the feminine. To call
this outrageous number sexist
understates the case.
Side one closes with a real tour
de force, "Enjoy and Get It On."
Lest you find this title suggestive
of sex, remember that Z.Z. Top
sells best with the junior high
set. What this song really discus
ses is a frankfurter smothered in
onions and French's mustard.
"Ten Dollar Man," which
kicks off side two, is the worst
song this group has recorded
since "Bar-B-Q" on their Rio
Grande Mud album. In gruff

fashion this number celebrates a
porcine male prostitute named
Jorge, who satisfies as many Te
xans as will cooperate. To com
pliment some well-developed
imagery. Gibbons plays wild,
heady guitar licks.
A final complaint: the poten
tial buyer (if there are any left)
should be wary of the album's
brevity.
The cover art work, reminding
us of Z.Z. Top's roots, is a pleas
ant painting of cattle and buffalo
grazing in the land of Pearl Light
Beer. But I wouldn't buy Tejas
for the cover alone.

imagery. Gibbons plays wild,
heady guitar licks.
A final complaint: the poten
tial buyer (if there are any left)
should be wary of the album's
brevity.
The cover art work, reminding
us of Z.Z. Top's roots, is a pleas
ant painting of cattle and buffalo
grazing in the land of Pearl Light
Beer. But I wouldn't buy Tejas
for the cover alone.
The group that brought you
livestock on stage and inspired
millions of beer-drinking, hell
raising teenage boys to get
downtown and find some
"Tush," has now brought you
Tejas.
In the Z.Z. Top tradition. Tejas
is a raucous, raunchy and revolt
ing album. After a few agonizing
listens, I wonder how this trio
managed to set the record for the
largest grossing world tour in
rock history.
Z.Z.'s ieader. Billy Gibbons

(guitar and vocals), Dusty Hill
(bass and vocals), and drummer
Frank Beard have cranked out
yet another tasteless collection
of 10 hard-driving metallic roc
kers. The sentiments conveyed
and the musical expression
thereof uniformly lack sophisti
cation, although their crudity is
unparalleled.
After the opener. "It's Only

Love," has thumped along for a
few minutes, the subject matter
gets much more interesting in
"Arrested for Driving While
Blind." Whether Wild Turkey or
social disease precipitated this
blindness remains unclear at the
song's conclusion.
Pandering to American fasci
nation with the satanic, "El Di
ablo" dabbles in peyote lore a la

Castaneda. In all fairness to Z.Z.,
this cut merits praise for its ap
pealing chord changes and
stands out as the album's
strongest composition.
But immediately following
the devil. "Snappy kakkie"
plunges into thinly veiled allu
sions to various aspects of
human anatomy, with the em
phasis on the feminine. To call
this outrageous number sexist
understates the case.
Side one closes with a real tour
de force, "Enjoy and Get It On."
Lest you find this title suggestive
of sex, remember that Z.Z. Top
sells best with the junior high
set. What this song really discus
ses is a frankfurter smothered in
onions and French's mustard.
"Ten Dollar Man," which
kicks off side two, is the worst
song this group has recorded
since "Bar-B-Q" on their Rio
Grande Mud album. In gruff

fashion this number celebrates a
porcine male prostitute named
Jorge, who satisfies as many Te
xans as will cooperate. To com
pliment some well-developed
imagery. Gibbons plays wild,
heady guitar licks.
