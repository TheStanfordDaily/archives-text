# Senate passes Carter's energy crisis legislation
## President also submits plan for $50 tax rebates 
### 
Washington (AP) —The Senate last
night voted to give President Carter the
emergency authority he requested to
deal with the cold-spawned natural
gas crisis.
Earlier, a House committee modified
the legislation to include new price
controls, but that was not expected to
delay final passage of the emergency
measure.
The House votes today and House
leaders were reportedly considering
bypassing the committee version anil
calling for a vote on the Senate-passed
measure instead.
By a 91-2 vote, the Senate approved
the bill in nearly the same form the
President had proposed and sent it to
the House. Voting against it were Sens.
James Abourezk (D-S.D.), and John
Tower (R-Tex.). Efforts at major mod
ifications were either voted down or
withdrawn after Senate leaders
warned that such amendments could
endanger the legislation.
On the other side of Capitol Hill, the
House Commerce Committee ap
proved its version of the bill with an
amendment to limit the price that
could be charged for some natural gas
during a period in which regular fed
eral price controls would be sus

pended.
The House panel sent the measure to
the floor under a speeded-up proce
dure that allows no further amend
ments but which requires a two-thirds
vote of House members.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chief
House sponsor of the bill, said he ex
pected to get the two-thirds vote and
believed that the amendment would
not substantially alter the thrust of the
legislation. A House-Senate confer
ence committee might have to be
named to work out a compromise once
the House acts, Dingell said.
However, Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd said there is a good
chance the House might avoid the
need for a conference committee by
voting instead on the Senate bill and
sending it directly to the President.
Byrd said House Majority Leader
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill had suggested
this approach to him. However, an
aideto Dingell, said Monday night that
while such a move was possible,
Dingell had no immediate plans to
abandon the House committee's bill in
favor of the Senate version.
Carter asked Congress to give him
the authority to allocate gas among in
terstate pipelines to get it to the areas
that need it the most. His measure
would also allow interstate pipelines
to buy gas from unregulated intrastate
markets—where it is more
expensive—through Aug.l.
The ceiling amendment adopted by
the House committee would apply to
the price of intrastate gas going into
interstate system under new contracts
in accord with the emergency provi
sions of the bill.
President Carter also sent to Con
gress yesterday his $31.2-hi 11 ion
economic program that includes a $50
tax rebate for nearly every American.
He said the program "only promises
what can realistically be done" to
speed economic growth.
"The economic program 1 have
proposed will set the stage for substan
tial growth in the years ahead," Carter
said in a statement. He also promised
his administration will "never let its
guard down" against inflation.
Carter said the two-year program
would help create one million new
jobs by the end of this year, which
would leave the nation's jobless rate at
about 6.8 per cent. The unemployment

rate in December was 7.8 per cent.
But the President warned Congress
against trying to move taster to create
jobs, as some lawmakers have said
they will try to do. "To force more
money, faster, into the system would
risk poor administration," Carter said.
However, he said the program is
flexible enough to be adjusted upward
or downward to meet specific needs of
the economy in the future.
The chief components of the prog
ram had been outlined by administra
tion officials in recent days. They in
clude $50 tax rebates for nearly every
American this year, with the total re
bate cost estimated at $11.4 billion

the House. Voting against it were Sens.
James Abourezk (D-S.D.), and John
Tower (R-Tex.). Efforts at major mod
ifications were either voted down or
withdrawn after Senate leaders
warned that such amendments could
endanger the legislation.
On the other side of Capitol Hill, the
House Commerce Committee ap
proved its version of the bill with an
amendment to limit the price that
could be charged for some natural gas
during a period in which regular fed
eral price controls would be sus

pended.
The House panel sent the measure to
the floor under a speeded-up proce
dure that allows no further amend
ments but which requires a two-thirds
vote of House members.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chief
House sponsor of the bill, said he ex
pected to get the two-thirds vote and
believed that the amendment would
not substantially alter the thrust of the
legislation. A House-Senate confer
ence committee might have to be
named to work out a compromise once
the House acts, Dingell said.
However, Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd said there is a good
chance the House might avoid the
need for a conference committee by
voting instead on the Senate bill and
sending it directly to the President.
Byrd said House Majority Leader
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill had suggested
this approach to him. However, an
aideto Dingell, said Monday night that
while such a move was possible,
Dingell had no immediate plans to
abandon the House committee's bill in
favor of the Senate version.
Carter asked Congress to give him
the authority to allocate gas among in
terstate pipelines to get it to the areas
that need it the most. His measure
would also allow interstate pipelines
to buy gas from unregulated intrastate
markets—where it is more
expensive—through Aug.l.
The ceiling amendment adopted by
the House committee would apply to
the price of intrastate gas going into
interstate system under new contracts
in accord with the emergency provi
sions of the bill.
President Carter also sent to Con
gress yesterday his $31.2-hi 11 ion
economic program that includes a $50
tax rebate for nearly every American.
He said the program "only promises
what can realistically be done" to
speed economic growth.
"The economic program 1 have
proposed will set the stage for substan
tial growth in the years ahead," Carter
said in a statement. He also promised
his administration will "never let its
guard down" against inflation.
Carter said the two-year program
would help create one million new
jobs by the end of this year, which
would leave the nation's jobless rate at
about 6.8 per cent. The unemployment

rate in December was 7.8 per cent.
But the President warned Congress
against trying to move taster to create
jobs, as some lawmakers have said
they will try to do. "To force more
money, faster, into the system would
risk poor administration," Carter said.
However, he said the program is
flexible enough to be adjusted upward
or downward to meet specific needs of
the economy in the future.

ram had been outlined by administra
tion officials in recent days. They in
clude $50 tax rebates for nearly every

Washington (AP) —The Senate last
night voted to give President Carter the
emergency authority he requested to
deal with the cold-spawned natural
gas crisis.
Earlier, a House committee modified
the legislation to include new price
controls, but that was not expected to
delay final passage of the emergency
measure.
The House votes today and House
leaders were reportedly considering
bypassing the committee version anil
calling for a vote on the Senate-passed
measure instead.

the bill in nearly the same form the
