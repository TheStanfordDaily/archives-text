# No cuts in cost
## Album prices soar 
### John Angel 
What happens when simple,
everyday pleasures suddenly as
sume the price of a luxury item?
For many people, the problem is
coffee, but for others, the prob
lem is records.
In these days of $3.50 movies,
records still seem like
reasonably-priced entertain
ment; more often than not. the

performances are top-rank, and
you can replay them many times.
The classical record buyer can
still choose from many good
discs at prices as low as $2.
But record junkies beware: the
price of a fix is almost sure to get
higher soon. London Records
has announced that certain of its
issues will carry a $7.98 list

price, and RCA has already
adopted that price for its Red
Seal classics.
The pop record buyer will not
be immune; RCA has already
successfully marketed some
soundtrack albums at an $8.98
list, and many pop labels may
adopt higher prices if buyer re
sistance doesn't develop.
Of course, it's an open secret
that record list prices are fictiti
ous, but consumers will proba
bly absorb the lion's share of the
one dollar increase.
Why are prices going up? Al
though there's no vinyl shortage,
the record companies have been
affected by general inflation.
Some sources say pressure for
higher prices has come mostly
from the distributors — mid
dlemen between manufacturers
and dealers.
Some long-range predictions:
this month's increases will cause
a general upward trend in all re
cord prices, unless sales fall off
drastically. And classical record
pricing may become fragmented
into budget, mid-, and full-price
segments, as has happened in
Europe.
Unfortunately, the new higher
prices probably will not bring
about the higher-grade pres
sings, which the European
buyers have known for years, or
other tangible improvements.

Shopping for bargains
With a list price of $7.98, records have become a luxury that not
everyone can afford. Even though records are almost always
sold for less than list, the market price reflects pressure from
distributors, who act as the middlemen between manufacturers
and dealers. Unfortunately, the new prices do not reflect higher
quality pressings.
