# The 						low-down on buying hi-fi
## 
### Bill Burger 
Those audiophiles who ha
ven't visited their nearest stereo
store lately should do so now!
Equipment changes in the past
few years have been dramatic,
and in most cases, the buyer is
getting a betterand bigger sound
for his money than was possible
two or three years ago.
But for those with unlimited
budgets, rest assured, there is
more high quality equipment on
the market than ever before; and
there is literally no end in sight
for the person who wants every
thing.
The speaker has improved
more than any other single com
ponent. The current trend with
speaker manufacturers is to sac
rifice size and efficiency for bet
ter sound quality. Bookshelf
speakers of very high quality can
now be found, and floor models
are not as bulky as in years past.
New companies such as AVID,
KEF, and B&W are leading the
way with their speaker lines.
You should compare them with
established names like JBL, Ad
vent, KLH. Ohm and EPI.
I was particularly impressed
with KEF's new "C" series
speakers. The Corel li is the finest
bookshelf speaker I have heard,
while the Calinda and Cantata
models are fine floor speakers
which take up relatively little
room. All of these will handle
the big amplifiers without any
trouble while giving you some of
the best sounds you'll ever hear.
If you're short of space, Vis
onik's "David" measures only
6x4x4 inches, but sounds just
like a big speaker. It is also prob
ably the most expensive speaker
on the market, pound for pound,

with a price tag of over $100.
Turntables, dollar for dollar,
are getting to be a better buy
every year. Both Pioneer and
Technics now make fine quality
lower- and medium-price
ranged turntables which are
comparable with models from
the established companies such
as Dual, Phillips and BIC.
For those with big budgets for
your sound fetishes. Bang &
Olufsen makes two turntables
that have to be seen to be be
lieved. They are the simplest and
finest turntables available today
at any price.
Kenwood and Pioneer head
the line in receivers with their
models XR-9600 and SX-1250
respectively, each putting out
160 RMS watts per channel. That
much power will blow apart any
speaker you can hook up to it.
These receivers are comparable
to some of the finest separate
amplifier-preamplifier-tuner
components you can buy at a
cheaper price.
If you can afford to have the
best separate components on the
market, look no further than
Nakamichi's new 600 series.
Aside from being the sharpest
looking equipment on the mar
ket, these wedge-shaped com
ponents have remarkable
specifications. Of course,
Marantz, Mcintosh and Yamaha
still make fine equipment, but
iheir established names should
not discourage the buyer from
trying something new, like
Nakamichi.
In headphones lighter is more
comfortable, but heavier keeps
distraction out. This is the hard
choice one has to make in pur
chasing headphones, since
lightweight phones have im
proved so much in the last few
years.
Speakers, turntables, receiv
ers, headphones, tape decks,
separate components and car
tridges are all improving year
after year, and they v/ill probably
continue to do so. But don't
worry that the system you
bought last week will become
obsolete by next week; the
changes are, for the most part,
gradual and few revolutionary
changes occur in a system's

lifetime.
The most difficult task in pur
chasing a stereo system is limit
ing your budget. There are
countless ways to spend 10 or 20
more dollars, and self-discipline
is essential in stereo shopping.
Stereos can be found for $200
or less, but one can buy turnta
bles for $700 and cassette decks
for $1100 if the sound is more
important than the money. The
industry is constantly coming
up with "state-of-the-art"
equipment, but it is also improv
ing the quality of music that can
be heard by the average college
age buyer. You can complain
about the prices, but you can't
complain about the choices
available.

If money is no object, today's range of stereo equipment is almost unlimited. From tiny, 6-inch
speakers, to $1100 cassett decks, the industry is constantly producing new models. But an
adequate system is still available for under $200.

continue to do so. But don't
worry that the system you

The most difficult task in pur
chasing a stereo system is limit
ing your budget. There are
countless ways to spend 10 or 20
more dollars, and self-discipline
is essential in stereo shopping.
Stereos can be found for $200
or less, but one can buy turnta
bles for $700 and cassette decks
for $1100 if the sound is more
important than the money. The
industry is constantly coming
up with "state-of-the-art"
equipment, but it is also improv
ing the quality of music that can
be heard by the average college
age buyer. You can complain
about the prices, but you can't
complain about the choices
available.

If money is no object, today's range of stereo equipment is almost unlimited. From tiny, 6-inch
speakers, to $1100 cassett decks, the industry is constantly producing new models. But an
adequate system is still available for under $200.
Those audiophiles who ha
ven't visited their nearest stereo
store lately should do so now!
Equipment changes in the past
few years have been dramatic,
and in most cases, the buyer is
getting a betterand bigger sound
for his money than was possible
two or three years ago.
But for those with unlimited
budgets, rest assured, there is
more high quality equipment on
the market than ever before; and
there is literally no end in sight
for the person who wants every
thing.
The speaker has improved
more than any other single com
ponent. The current trend with
speaker manufacturers is to sac
rifice size and efficiency for bet
ter sound quality. Bookshelf
speakers of very high quality can
now be found, and floor models
are not as bulky as in years past.
New companies such as AVID,
KEF, and B&W are leading the
way with their speaker lines.
You should compare them with
established names like JBL, Ad
vent, KLH. Ohm and EPI.
I was particularly impressed
with KEF's new "C" series
speakers. The Corel li is the finest
bookshelf speaker I have heard,
while the Calinda and Cantata
models are fine floor speakers
which take up relatively little
room. All of these will handle
the big amplifiers without any
trouble while giving you some of
the best sounds you'll ever hear.
If you're short of space, Vis
onik's "David" measures only
6x4x4 inches, but sounds just
like a big speaker. It is also prob
ably the most expensive speaker
on the market, pound for pound,

with a price tag of over $100.
Turntables, dollar for dollar,
are getting to be a better buy
every year. Both Pioneer and
Technics now make fine quality
lower- and medium-price
ranged turntables which are
comparable with models from
the established companies such
as Dual, Phillips and BIC.
For those with big budgets for
your sound fetishes. Bang &
Olufsen makes two turntables
that have to be seen to be be
lieved. They are the simplest and
finest turntables available today
at any price.
Kenwood and Pioneer head
the line in receivers with their
models XR-9600 and SX-1250
respectively, each putting out
160 RMS watts per channel. That
much power will blow apart any
speaker you can hook up to it.
These receivers are comparable
to some of the finest separate
amplifier-preamplifier-tuner
components you can buy at a
cheaper price.
If you can afford to have the
best separate components on the
market, look no further than
Nakamichi's new 600 series.
Aside from being the sharpest
looking equipment on the mar
ket, these wedge-shaped com
ponents have remarkable
specifications. Of course,
Marantz, Mcintosh and Yamaha
still make fine equipment, but
iheir established names should
not discourage the buyer from
trying something new, like
Nakamichi.
In headphones lighter is more
comfortable, but heavier keeps
distraction out. This is the hard
choice one has to make in pur
chasing headphones, since
lightweight phones have im
proved so much in the last few
years.
Speakers, turntables, receiv
ers, headphones, tape decks,
separate components and car
tridges are all improving year
after year, and they v/ill probably
continue to do so. But don't
worry that the system you
bought last week will become

lieved. They are the simplest and
finest turntables available today
at any price.
Kenwood and Pioneer head
the line in receivers with their
models XR-9600 and SX-1250
respectively, each putting out
160 RMS watts per channel. That
much power will blow apart any
speaker you can hook up to it.
These receivers are comparable
to some of the finest separate
amplifier-preamplifier-tuner
components you can buy at a
cheaper price.
If you can afford to have the
best separate components on the
market, look no further than
Nakamichi's new 600 series.
Aside from being the sharpest
looking equipment on the mar
ket, these wedge-shaped com
ponents have remarkable
specifications. Of course,
Marantz, Mcintosh and Yamaha
still make fine equipment, but
iheir established names should
not discourage the buyer from
trying something new, like
Nakamichi.
In headphones lighter is more
comfortable, but heavier keeps
distraction out. This is the hard
choice one has to make in pur
chasing headphones, since
lightweight phones have im
proved so much in the last few
years.
Speakers, turntables, receiv
ers, headphones, tape decks,
separate components and car
tridges are all improving year
after year, and they v/ill probably
continue to do so. But don't
worry that the system you
bought last week will become
obsolete by next week; the
changes are, for the most part,
gradual and few revolutionary
changes occur in a system's

lifetime.
The most difficult task in pur
chasing a stereo system is limit
ing your budget. There are
countless ways to spend 10 or 20
more dollars, and self-discipline
is essential in stereo shopping.
Stereos can be found for $200
or less, but one can buy turnta
bles for $700 and cassette decks
for $1100 if the sound is more
important than the money. The
industry is constantly coming
up with "state-of-the-art"
equipment, but it is also improv
ing the quality of music that can
be heard by the average college
age buyer. You can complain
about the prices, but you can't
complain about the choices
available.

If money is no object, today's range of stereo equipment is almost unlimited. From tiny, 6-inch
speakers, to $1100 cassett decks, the industry is constantly producing new models. But an
adequate system is still available for under $200.
