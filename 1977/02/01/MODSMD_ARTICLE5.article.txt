# It all comes down to 'good faith'
## Vagueness in Iran contract causes misunderstanding 
### Mike Charlson Jim Tranquada News analysis 
The current contractual difficulties between the univer
sity and Iran have been the cause of considerable concern
to the university. Earl Cilley, director of Sponsored Pro
jects, has concluded that in the long run, it all comes down
to "good faith."
Certainly, if the resolution of the "misunderstanding"
was dependent solely on the good faith and busi ness repu
tation of the university, the dispute would be resolved
immediately. Yet there are more concrete aspects to the
situation which need to be considered.
The $978,000 contract between the university and Na
tional Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT) to develop a tele
communications satellite system and recommendations
for educational programming has been plagued by prob
lems which raise questions about research, especially
overseas research, here.
Why is Stanford the only university we know of which
has had a serious problem with an Iranian contract?
As Cilley and Vice-Provost for Research William Massy
have pointed out, international business involves a cer
tain amount ofdelay and "friction" which slowsdown the
process of normal business relations.
Prevalent problem
In Iran, this problem is especially prevalent. According
to Robert Beales, Iranian desk economic officer at the State
Department, bureaucratic delays in Iran are very common.
This factor alone cannot account for the problems the
university has encountered, however.
The university suffered from inexperience when
negotiating the NIRT contract. "We have not done very
much overseas." Cilley explained. "I think it is fair to say
that if we were to do it again, right now, knowing what we
know now, we would probably do it differently," Massy
added.
The university made the mistake of dealing with Iran as
it would with any U.S. institution. "Weassumed moreofa
basic understanding and commonality," said Massy. "We
approached the Iranians in this thing as we would (an
.igency of the U.S. government)."
The financial arrangements of the contract illustrate
this point. The university included a clause calling for a
"Standby Letter of Credit" in the contract s payment pro
visions to act as a payment guarantee. However, a defini
tion of this important term was never included. (The only
true guarantee would be an irrevocable letter of credit.)
And little attention seemed to have been paid to the fact

that a letter of credit never arrived, even after nonpayment
became apparent.
Complications
In addition, the university's "decentralized research
policy" probably led to a number of administrative com
plications, said Asst. Sponsored Projects Director lon
Erickson. He seemed to imply that the principal inves
tigator for any research project is almost autonomous in
much of his responsibility towards the projects.

For example, principal investigator Bruce Lusignan,
associate professor of electrical engineering, made a
number of verbal agreements with the Iranians himself,
without notifying Sponsored Projects immediately.
In addition, the administrative structure responsible for
accounting on this project broke down. No one drew atten
tion to the fact that the Iranians weren't paying as much as
they owed until the sum had become rather substantial.
Central to the dispute is the vagueness of the work

provisions of the contract. It appears that NIRT and the
Communications Department here have different in
terpretations of what the work statement called for. The
Iranians in their termination notice cited general dissatis
faction with the educational programming recommenda
tions.
Vagueness
Vagueness is a problem inherent in research contracts,
according to Massy.
"The tighter you make the work statement, the less
chance of running into this kind of misunderstanding," he
said. "On the other hand, the tighter you make the work
statement, the more difficult it is to really pursue the work
in scientifically the best way."
However, a recent study by the American Council on
Education (ACE) of university agreements with Iran ac
ross the country recommended that negotiators give
"more attention to details during the negotiation of ag
reement to avoid 'misunderstandings' — including ag
reement on clear, precise objectives."
The university has proceeded cautiously because of the
tendency of the Iranians to misconstrue discussion of the
problem as criticism due to the controversial nature of
the government in Iran.
Nonetheless, the university is examining all alterna
tives. It seems logical that the university will not deliver
all final reports of the contract until assurance is received
that payment is forthcoming. On the other hand, the Ira
nians have shown no inclination to clarify their dissatis
faction or continue payments, presumably awaiting de
livery of the final reports.
Reports should be complete early this week, according
to Cilley.
Problems in payment may also stem from what the ACE
report calls a "recent cash flow problem" which has
"created difficulties for some projects." It could also be
conjectured that by withholding payment, Iran could as
sure itself of getting exactly what it wants.
Whatever the reasons for nonpayment, it seems unlikely
that the situation will be resolved in the very near future.
In the meantime, said Cilley. the university is examining
contract procedures and "a number of different kinds of
steps we could take to minimize that likelihood of misun
derstandings (in the future.)"

has had a serious problem with an Iranian contract?
As Cilley and Vice-Provost for Research William Massy
have pointed out, international business involves a cer
tain amount ofdelay and "friction" which slowsdown the
process of normal business relations.
Prevalent problem
In Iran, this problem is especially prevalent. According
to Robert Beales, Iranian desk economic officer at the State
Department, bureaucratic delays in Iran are very common.
This factor alone cannot account for the problems the
university has encountered, however.
The university suffered from inexperience when
negotiating the NIRT contract. "We have not done very
much overseas." Cilley explained. "I think it is fair to say
that if we were to do it again, right now, knowing what we
know now, we would probably do it differently," Massy
added.
The university made the mistake of dealing with Iran as
it would with any U.S. institution. "Weassumed moreofa
basic understanding and commonality," said Massy. "We
approached the Iranians in this thing as we would (an
.igency of the U.S. government)."
The financial arrangements of the contract illustrate
this point. The university included a clause calling for a
"Standby Letter of Credit" in the contract s payment pro
visions to act as a payment guarantee. However, a defini
tion of this important term was never included. (The only
true guarantee would be an irrevocable letter of credit.)
And little attention seemed to have been paid to the fact

that a letter of credit never arrived, even after nonpayment
became apparent.
Complications
In addition, the university's "decentralized research
policy" probably led to a number of administrative com
plications, said Asst. Sponsored Projects Director lon
Erickson. He seemed to imply that the principal inves
tigator for any research project is almost autonomous in
much of his responsibility towards the projects.

For example, principal investigator Bruce Lusignan,
associate professor of electrical engineering, made a
number of verbal agreements with the Iranians himself,
without notifying Sponsored Projects immediately.
In addition, the administrative structure responsible for
accounting on this project broke down. No one drew atten
tion to the fact that the Iranians weren't paying as much as
they owed until the sum had become rather substantial.
Central to the dispute is the vagueness of the work

provisions of the contract. It appears that NIRT and the
Communications Department here have different in
terpretations of what the work statement called for. The
Iranians in their termination notice cited general dissatis
faction with the educational programming recommenda
tions.
Vagueness
Vagueness is a problem inherent in research contracts,
according to Massy.
"The tighter you make the work statement, the less
chance of running into this kind of misunderstanding," he
said. "On the other hand, the tighter you make the work
statement, the more difficult it is to really pursue the work
in scientifically the best way."
However, a recent study by the American Council on
Education (ACE) of university agreements with Iran ac
ross the country recommended that negotiators give
"more attention to details during the negotiation of ag
reement to avoid 'misunderstandings' — including ag
reement on clear, precise objectives."
The university has proceeded cautiously because of the
tendency of the Iranians to misconstrue discussion of the
problem as criticism due to the controversial nature of
the government in Iran.
Nonetheless, the university is examining all alterna
tives. It seems logical that the university will not deliver
all final reports of the contract until assurance is received
that payment is forthcoming. On the other hand, the Ira
nians have shown no inclination to clarify their dissatis
faction or continue payments, presumably awaiting de
livery of the final reports.
Reports should be complete early this week, according
to Cilley.
Problems in payment may also stem from what the ACE
report calls a "recent cash flow problem" which has
"created difficulties for some projects." It could also be
conjectured that by withholding payment, Iran could as
sure itself of getting exactly what it wants.
Whatever the reasons for nonpayment, it seems unlikely
that the situation will be resolved in the very near future.
In the meantime, said Cilley. the university is examining
contract procedures and "a number of different kinds of
steps we could take to minimize that likelihood of misun
derstandings (in the future.)"

The current contractual difficulties between the univer
sity and Iran have been the cause of considerable concern
to the university. Earl Cilley, director of Sponsored Pro
jects, has concluded that in the long run, it all comes down
to "good faith."
Certainly, if the resolution of the "misunderstanding"
was dependent solely on the good faith and busi ness repu
tation of the university, the dispute would be resolved
immediately. Yet there are more concrete aspects to the
situation which need to be considered.
The $978,000 contract between the university and Na
tional Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT) to develop a tele
communications satellite system and recommendations
for educational programming has been plagued by prob
lems which raise questions about research, especially
overseas research, here.

it would with any U.S. institution. "Weassumed moreofa
basic understanding and commonality," said Massy. "We
approached the Iranians in this thing as we would (an
.igency of the U.S. government)."
The financial arrangements of the contract illustrate
this point. The university included a clause calling for a
"Standby Letter of Credit" in the contract s payment pro
visions to act as a payment guarantee. However, a defini
tion of this important term was never included. (The only
true guarantee would be an irrevocable letter of credit.)
And little attention seemed to have been paid to the fact

that a letter of credit never arrived, even after nonpayment
became apparent.
Complications
In addition, the university's "decentralized research
policy" probably led to a number of administrative com
plications, said Asst. Sponsored Projects Director lon
Erickson. He seemed to imply that the principal inves
tigator for any research project is almost autonomous in
much of his responsibility towards the projects.

For example, principal investigator Bruce Lusignan,
associate professor of electrical engineering, made a
number of verbal agreements with the Iranians himself,
without notifying Sponsored Projects immediately.
In addition, the administrative structure responsible for
accounting on this project broke down. No one drew atten
tion to the fact that the Iranians weren't paying as much as
they owed until the sum had become rather substantial.
Central to the dispute is the vagueness of the work

provisions of the contract. It appears that NIRT and the
Communications Department here have different in
terpretations of what the work statement called for. The
Iranians in their termination notice cited general dissatis
faction with the educational programming recommenda
tions.
Vagueness
Vagueness is a problem inherent in research contracts,
according to Massy.
"The tighter you make the work statement, the less
chance of running into this kind of misunderstanding," he
said. "On the other hand, the tighter you make the work
statement, the more difficult it is to really pursue the work
in scientifically the best way."
However, a recent study by the American Council on
Education (ACE) of university agreements with Iran ac
ross the country recommended that negotiators give
"more attention to details during the negotiation of ag
reement to avoid 'misunderstandings' — including ag
reement on clear, precise objectives."
The university has proceeded cautiously because of the
tendency of the Iranians to misconstrue discussion of the
problem as criticism due to the controversial nature of
the government in Iran.
Nonetheless, the university is examining all alterna
tives. It seems logical that the university will not deliver
all final reports of the contract until assurance is received
that payment is forthcoming. On the other hand, the Ira
nians have shown no inclination to clarify their dissatis
faction or continue payments, presumably awaiting de
livery of the final reports.
Reports should be complete early this week, according
to Cilley.
Problems in payment may also stem from what the ACE
report calls a "recent cash flow problem" which has
"created difficulties for some projects." It could also be
conjectured that by withholding payment, Iran could as
sure itself of getting exactly what it wants.
Whatever the reasons for nonpayment, it seems unlikely
that the situation will be resolved in the very near future.
In the meantime, said Cilley. the university is examining
contract procedures and "a number of different kinds of
steps we could take to minimize that likelihood of misun
derstandings (in the future.)"

The current contractual difficulties between the univer
sity and Iran have been the cause of considerable concern
to the university. Earl Cilley, director of Sponsored Pro
jects, has concluded that in the long run, it all comes down
to "good faith."
Certainly, if the resolution of the "misunderstanding"
was dependent solely on the good faith and busi ness repu
tation of the university, the dispute would be resolved
immediately. Yet there are more concrete aspects to the
situation which need to be considered.
The $978,000 contract between the university and Na
tional Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT) to develop a tele
communications satellite system and recommendations
for educational programming has been plagued by prob
lems which raise questions about research, especially
overseas research, here.
Why is Stanford the only university we know of which
has had a serious problem with an Iranian contract?
As Cilley and Vice-Provost for Research William Massy
have pointed out, international business involves a cer
tain amount ofdelay and "friction" which slowsdown the
process of normal business relations.
Prevalent problem
In Iran, this problem is especially prevalent. According
to Robert Beales, Iranian desk economic officer at the State
Department, bureaucratic delays in Iran are very common.
This factor alone cannot account for the problems the
university has encountered, however.
The university suffered from inexperience when
negotiating the NIRT contract. "We have not done very
much overseas." Cilley explained. "I think it is fair to say
that if we were to do it again, right now, knowing what we
know now, we would probably do it differently," Massy
added.
The university made the mistake of dealing with Iran as
it would with any U.S. institution. "Weassumed moreofa
basic understanding and commonality," said Massy. "We
approached the Iranians in this thing as we would (an
.igency of the U.S. government)."
