Tin ear
As a composer, harpsichordist and
music student, I was very disap
pointed to read Glenn Weadock's re
view of a viola recital played here re
cently by Marcus Thompson. The reci
tal, which consisted largely of 20th
century works, was panned by
Weadock as "not entertaining, pleas
ing, or musically satisfying," appa
rently because the music general ly did
not meet Weadock's demand for
"melodic" or "attractive" music.
Everyone is of course entitled to his
or her opinion about music, especially
contemporary music, but Weadock's
review reads like some of the things
that were being written 50 years ago by
people unable to hear any but the most
obvious, harmonically traditional
melodies, as melodies, or to find any
but the most conventional sound tex
tures "attractive."
I personally find it particularly of
fensive to read his smug reference to
the "unimpressive ending" of the
sonata by the late Russian composer
Dmitri Shostakovitch, in which
Weadock apparently failed to recog
nize the many sardonic references to
Beethoven's well-known "Moonlight"
sonata. >
It is unfortunate that to such a con
cert as this the Daily cannot send a
critic with a sufficiently broad
perspective on 20th century (or any)
music to give it an informed and bal
anced review. I hope Weadock in
particular will make every effort to
hear a wide range of 20th century
music, of which the Bay Area offers
quite a lot, before blithely rejecting it
as being beyond his comprehension. A
reviewer ought to be able to distin
guish personal prejudices and prefer
ences from an objective discussion of
the music and the performance. Both
are essential if the review is to be fair to
the artists, or a service to its readers.

Massage parlor
At the next ASSU Senate meeting,
Hammer and Coffin is going to intro
duce a proposal that will be laughed at
by some, taken as a joke by many. It
will be no joke. We shall attempt to set
up a new ASSU project of unlimited
student benefit and profitability. The
project — an ASSU Massage Parlor.
The service will be available to re
gistered students only, and ideally
open 24 hours. The staffers will be a
blend of students and non-students,
though students will be given priority,
within reason. The price will be com
parable to those of local parlors, but
the convenience and security will be
unparalleled. It will be located inTre
sidder Union, a location accessible to
al 1 students, as results of the recent fee
assessment refunds indicate. If suc
cessful, the ASSU will petition to have
Hammarskjold House converted into a
more elaborate massage facility. (Have
you ever met anybody that lived in
Hammarskjold House?)
The advantages to students
would be enormous. First, those stu
dents who staff the parlor will be able
to pay for their tuition, room and board
by working less than 20 hours a week.
Second, those students who patronize
the parlors will find themselves with
vastly reduced levels of tension, both

physical and emotional. Grades would
soar, and Stanford would find itself
breeding a generation of superstu
dents. Furthermore, the ASSU would
improve its image as servants to the
student body immensely, possibly
even surpassing the Berkeley Student
Union in terms of respect from the ad
ministration. And I haven't even men
tioned the tremendous profit potential
of this venture yet.
The profits from this project would
probably run in the $200,000 range the
first year, this low sum due only to
inexperience on the part of the project
managers. We aren't talking about
some two-bit T-shirt service that
brings in 49 cents a month, we're talk
ing big bucks. The kind of bucks that
bring an administration to its knees.
Students deciding tenure? You bet.'
Student on the Board of Trustees?
Screw that, let's get a majority!
But I need your help, average Stan
ford student. The ASSU Massage Par
lor will need a large staff. If enough of
you are interested in earning about 20
dollars an hour in your spare time
(more during finals), and you feel that
you meet the qualifications for a first
class masseuse, stop by the Chaparral
during the afternoon some time this
week, or call me at home or at the
Chappie any time, and we'll set up an
appointment. Auditions will be rigor
ous but rewarding. If I can go into the
next Senate meeting with an over
whelming amount of student interest,
relief will be just a quorum away.

Organic chem
This letter is in response to the arti
cle on pre-meds' complaints about the
organic chemistry sequence. First of
all, it contained several errors. Beil
stein is not a text but a reference and
requires only a minimal German voc
abulary. The majority of students have
no need to use it for there are many
English language references available.
In addition, the picture of the student
"sweating over an organic lab" hap
pens to be a graduate student doing
research.
Although they are correct in that
there are some legitimate gripes about
the curriculum, I was appalled at what
they chose to single out for emphasis.
They have a tendency to equate hard
courses with bad courses; making
chemistry labs pass/fail (or easier) will
not make them any better. I get the
feeling that they want to change the
chemistry core so that it will be possi
ble to slide through with a minimum
amount of work and/or learning.
Chemistry is an intrinsic part of
medicine and its understanding takes
time and effort, time that these people
are obviously not willing to spend.
One begins to question the quality of a
doctor who fails to see the importance
of such a background.

Northern Ireland
It was reassuring to learn today that
the British army is in Northern Ireland
partly to protect U.S. capital, and that,
by direct inference, it is being sub
sidized by American interests. Since it
would cost about the same, give or take

a few rounds of ammunition, to main
tain the army wherever it was, and
since even Britain is entitled to a little
army. Her Majesty's Government, not
to mention the International Monetary
Fund (IMP'), must be hugely relieved
that the Ulster situation has provided
sufficient foreign funds to enable them
to keep at least part of the army for free.
And of course they need have no
worry that the unrest — the ostensible
reason for the army's presence — will
soon disappear: apparently the CIA is
subsidizing the provisional Irish Re
publican Army (IRA), so that the
British army will not be forced into an
early withdrawal consequent on the
financial failure of their opponents.
Brilliant planning worthy of Howard
Hunt.
The article also gives us a new and
refreshing historical perspective. So
Britain (not formed until the Act of
Union in 1707, but let that pass) con
quered Ireland at the battle of the
Boyne in 1690?
As it was the English crown
which they were disputing, isn't it
more likely that they chose to fight in
Ireland, not because it remotely af
fected the Irish (since in fact it didn't),
but so that both sides could get the
benefit of U.S. subsidies?
