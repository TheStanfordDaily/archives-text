# Hazards of recombinant research

Although much of the scientific community
would have us believe that research on recombin
ant DNA is conducted under broad guidelines (es
tablished this summer by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), with well thought-out laboratory
security conditions nevertheless, the extreme un
predictability of potentially hazardous biological
accidents which may threaten all human life de
mand that a complete moratorium be legally estab
lished not only upon the scientific community, but
especially within the industrial sector until much
more stringent conditions can be compromised
upon, until more questions on possible dangers can
be raised as well as answered, and until the public
has had a chance to become informed enough to
determine for itself whether this entire field of re
search is justifiable.
Furthermore, the greatest dangers cannot be met
adequately, no matter how long a moratorium, if
the nonscientific community does not actively in
volve itself in the decision process.
bast night was the first public meeting for the
Stanford community on this issue. Whereas Dr.
David Hogness presented an overview of the whole
situation last night, tonight, the public will have
the opportunity to discuss all concerns in open
forum. The meeting will be held in the medical
school's Sherman Fairchild Center Auditorium at
8:00 p.m.
Built-in benefits
The necessity for public involvement is not to
wisely balance benefits vs. risks of the research and
its consequences. The benefits are already built into
the system. The desire for patents, for Nobel prizes,
for increased knowledge (knowledge as the ability
to control/manipulate the environment, indeed
man himself) and thus power (economic and milit
ary) have spurred a flurry of research in the most
very recent years in major universities here, in
Europe and in manufacturing sectors.

The western paradigm which accepts as a post
ulate the intrinsic value of al I knowledge (as power)
without emphasizing concomittant wisdom exists
as the framework for all research within the
capitalist economy. Present industries are not will
ing to follow NIH guidelines for safety, or to re
lease to the public knowledge of specific research
they are doing due to the restraints of competition.
Therefore, the benefits of this research do not need
to be even weighed, they are already being sought
as if they were the only value to be considered.
Four points
The hazards of this research have four crucial
aspects:
—they are almost completely unpredictable;
epidemics may result which could not have been
logically foreseen;
—specific possible dangers are estimated as
being extremely unlikely, however, probabilities of
biological accidents, at this stage are largely arbit
rary with little attention paid to human fallibilities
in laboratory precautions;
—potential hazards are not confined to laborat
ory personnel or to the industrial costs. Instead,
biologial infection threatens to spread quickly
throughout mankind:
—as yet, the social costs are nowhere built into
the system. Theoretically, if a lethal strain of bac
teria results which kills off all human life, then the
system will respond by ending research, but the
point is that this particular science transcends all
small-scale cost-benefit thinking.
Nature of the danger
The bacterium used for research at the Stanford
Medical School and elsewhere is Escherichia coli
(E-coli). This is an obvious choice since there is
more known about this one-celled species, espe
cially in terms of genetics, than any other living
species. However, the knowlege about it correlates
positively with its übiquity and its importance. E.
coli exists in the large intestines of al 1 humans and

indeed, help humans by synthesizing vitamin K. E.
coli also exists in warm-blooded mammals in gen
eral and insects. If any original strain of a species
could be created which was lethal or cancer
carrying, no better choice exists than E. coli.
Laboratory practice involves the use of an enfee
bled strain ofE.coli present in all humans as well as
of the DNA transducing virus. Although lethal
strains of this bacteria may be considerably less
dangerous to directly, nevertheless, E. coli
exchange plasmids so readily that lethal charac
teristics could easily be spread to enough normal E.
coli to infect and kill all humankind.
The reasfpn that other bacteria are not utilized in
recombinant research is because not enough famil
iarity exists for any other than E. coli. This can be
interpreted as meaning that no individual re
searcher can afford to postpone this end of research
to allow time for increased familiarity with another
species due to the competitive framework of the
entire system.
The potentials of new life-forms, never before
appearing in nature, threaten life in many specifi
cally conceivable ways — New organisms created
and thrust into an eco-system all at once without
the checks and balances of evolution may disrupt
and destroy balances which were necessary for the
survival of unprepared E. coli could well come to
live in people. E. coli containing cancer genes
could escape from a laboratory and breed wide
spread cancer.
However, the truly frightening prospects are the
specific threates which are not yet conceivable. Not
until this research has been carried out to its tragic
end will anyonebeabletoexperientially state what
the potential dangers are. The problems, then, re
volve not about the questions which remain un
answered, but the questions which remain un
asked.
