# Palo Alto's war on the driver
## 
### 
Not content with recent efforts to
expurgate the sins of prostitution, pin
ball and pornographic comics from the
streets of their fair city, Palo Alto offi
cials are pressing onward with their
bravest social experiment to date: an
effort to harass the automobile driver
out of existence.
As bad as the traffic flow is on the
Stanford campus, with the omnipre
sence of stop signs and those damna
ble white poles, neighboring Palo Alto
provides scant relief.
My experience suggests that this
community's vehicle flow suffers
more interceptions than does that of

any other suburban area in the United
States. Unlike the impediments in
most other places, however, those in
Palo Alto are not the result of planning
office flaws — they are deliberate.
To some of us, the snarled traffic pat
terns of College Terrace are a
nightmare. To the Palo Alto Planning
Commission, those barricaded streets
are a model for the future.
The argument goes, of course, that
neighborhood streets aren't meant for
through traffic, that those who live in
Zone B between Zones A and C are
entitled to force outlying residents to
drive around Zone B in order to get

from A to C.
In the case of College Terrace, that
means rerouting drivers onto Stanford
Avenue and El Camino Real. There
they incur the second stage of Palo Al-

to's wrath: the stop light.
In many places, the stop light func
tions as a facilitator for traffic, main
taining order where before there was
chaos. Not in Palo Alto. Here, the
lights at many intersections bring only
delay, timed as they seemingly are to
insure maximum exposure of the
driver to the color red.
Palo Alto officials admit that the
light at Stanford Avenue and Hanover
Street is red in all directions for ex
tended periods, in order to discourage
drivers from using those streets.
And then there are the stop signs —
oh, the stop signs! Apparently so many
people complained about the stop sign
glut that the city council last year used
a $15,500 state tax grant to hirea traffic
consultant to tell them what the prob
lem was.
Harassment four-ways
The consultant told them: you have
too many stop signs, particularly
four-way stops, on your residential
streets. So many of them, in fact, that
93 per cent of the drivers pass right
through them, at speeds ranging from
2V2 to 10 miles an hour.
Additionally, the consultant's study
showed that most motorists acceler
ated beyond the speed limits between
the stops, presumably to make up for
lost time.
The city council told the consultant:
Thank you very much, you keep your
money, but we're going to keep our
stop signs. In fact, we'll probably put
some more in.
After all, some 270 of Palo Alto's
1000 intersections don't even have one

stop sign yet! And only 120 of those
intersections have the complete set of
four!
Yes, Virginia, certitude is alive and
well in Palo Alto.
So too is a regrettable aspect of
democratic politics hy which a narrow
interest group with intense feelings (in
this case, PTA members and homeow
ners who equate stop signs with the
safety of their children and the quiet of
their neighborhood) is able to carry the
day against the less impassioned con
cerns of a larger group.
Agitation
There is that safety question, of
course. It is true that lower speeds,
other factors being equal, mean fewer
accidents. It's also true that when I
drive in Palo Alto, 1 become so agitated
that my driving can't help but suffer
measurably. When I get delayed by an
unnecessary traffic regulation, I'm less
likely to obey the next one, needed or
not. On 25-miles-an-hour Embarcad
ero, I spend more time looking out for
police than pedestrians.
Also, there's the impact on pollution
and fuel. All those stops and starts
cause more of the first and leave less of
the second.
I know, I know — there are other
means of transportation available
which are more socially desirable and
which I ought to use. Well, I'll be the
judge of that. If there are pollution and
congestion costs to my using my car,
charge them to me, and I'll decide
whether it's still worth it to drive.
But please, Palo Alto, don't continue
your policy of instituting inefficiency.
It really doesn't make society better off
in the long run, and it sure wracks my
nerves in the short run.
*****
In my last column, on heroes, two of
my nominees ended up on the cutting
room floor, certainly no place for their
like. The missing paragraph read:
"Two other athletic figures have
transcended the world of sport be
cause of the particular social milieu of
their accomplishments. They are ten
nis star Billie Jean King and Grambling
football coach Eddie Robinson."
