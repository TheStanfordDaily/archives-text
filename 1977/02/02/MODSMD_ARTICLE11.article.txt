# Thai regime repressive

One must feel grateful for the chance
to have heard Dr. Puey Ungpakorn
speak here last week. He has staked out
very special and critical ground on
Thailand's present political terrain —
an unwavering devotion to political
freedom, even in the midst of an in
creasingly desperate struggle for jus
tice.
One cannot doubt how urgently
needed in Thailand is his eloquent
commitment to rights of conscience as
well as rights of material well-being.
Nor can it be doubted that Puey's
message is more critically important
with each passing day, as younger
Thai intellectuals conclude in increas
ing numbers that justice can only be
delivered by force of arms, whatever
the costs in freedom of thought, ex
pression, and participation.
And so, one cannot help feeling
deeply saddened that Thailand has
been denied Puey's voice, and those of
so many other Thai patriots like him
who have been murdered, imprisoned,
exiled or otherwise silenced since the
military brutally ended that nation's
three-year effort at democracy last Oc
tober 6.
Puey was Rector of Thammasat Uni
versity, the most prestigious in Thai
land, until that day when the generals
declared war on his students and on
the vision of political freedom and
egalitarian development they had
been struggling for.
We are told he was fortunate to have
escaped with his life that night. He is
very much alive, but we cannot be so
sure about his vision.
If Puey is right, the dream of a free
Thailand has not much time left before
it is buried on the battlefield. Civil war
between a reactionary military
business elite and a network of
communist-led insurgents, swollen
with the ranks of progressive young

students and intellectuals: this is the
warning of a most sober and skilled
observer of the Thai political scene,
one whose natural inclination, he tel Is
us, is optimism.
It is a warning that ought to alarm us
all.
It ought to move to action a large
number of Americans whose concern
may stem from anyone of several
sources: a love for the Thai people,
their warmth and generosity, the
beauty of their land and culture; a con
viction that both justice and freedom
matter in a world were the latter is very
much in retreat; an admiration for the
powerfully idealistic Thai students
who brought down a reactionary dic
tatorship three years ago and struggled
mightily thereafter lo reorder Thailand
within the framework of democracy;
and a fear of the implications for this
country of another communist-led
civil war in Southeast Asia.
We cannot rest easy at the prospect
of humane and reasonable people hav
ing to choose between a to
talitarianism of the left and a to
talitarianism of the right. But neither
can we. from thecomfort of this nation,
urge them not to make that terrible
choice unless we help make viable a
third alternative — the path of growth
not only with redistribution, but with
freedom.
For decades an incestuous alliance
of financial and military elites has
sucked resources from rural Thailand
and drained them into Bangkok,
enormously enriching themselves and
building a great and accommodating
city for Western businessmen and
tourists.
Three years of a democratic style of
government began to challenge, if only
feebly, the semi-feudal structures that
maintained this gross inequality bet
ween town and countrv. Even a hint of

reform was more than the encrusted
structure of privilege would tolerate.
So life is now getting worse again in
the countryside, Puey tells us, with
explosive implications. Even those
who question his simple causal chain
from rural poverty to discontent to
communism cannot dispute the fact
that poor farmers once awakened io
the realization that their suffering -is
neither just nor inevitable, are indeed a
volatile lot.
Their volatility in Thailand today is
evidenced by the government's own
official recognition that it has simply
lost control in half of the country's
provinces.
There may not be much time left for
a free Thailand, but there is something
we in this nation can do to keep that
vision alive. We must put the Carter
administration to a test of its stated
intention to reestablish some em
phasis on morality in our foreign pol
icy.
The present Thai regime may be
susceptible to Western pressure, espe
cially American pressure, because of
its dependence on American military
aid and its need for Western economic
assistance.
It is just possible that a clear and
forceful American pledge not to sup
port an autocratic regime in any future
civil war may yield some results.
