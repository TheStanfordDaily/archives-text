# Balloonist soars across U.S. to break 41-day world record

Arcadia, Calif (AP) — Dressed in a silver,
down-filled, one-piece outfit with matching muk
luks, Karl Thomas floated eastward yesterday in
his attempt to soar across the United States in a
hot-air balloon.
The 28-year-old balloonist from Troy, Mich ,
donned the warm suit Monday evening at Santa
Anita Park race track, where the balloon was
being readied for yesterday's early morning take
off. There, Thomas and the sponsoring Ford
Motor Co. staged an impressive sendoff party.
Thomas' balloon, fueled by a propane heater,
has a maximum air time of about 12 hours. He
planned two pit stops en route to Phoenix, Ariz.,
on the first leg of the trip to Florida.
At his first stop in the California desert near
Salton Sea, Thomas sipped orange juice,
munched a candy bar and took off again within 15
minutes.
Thomas is alone in the five-by-five gondola
under his Limited Edition Sail balloon, which is
shaped like a light bulb. But his entourage below
him, in a half-dozen off-road vehicles, includes IB
people, each with a different task.
Heading the crew is Bill Stroppe, one of the best

offroad racers in uie business. It's his job to get the
caravan to wherever the balloon goes — up hills,
across dry washes, through any sort of rugged
terrain.
Stroppe was almost stopped, however, just after
the initial liftoff at 3:30 a.m. yesterday when the
balloon headed west instead of east. Had it been
blown off the coast, Stroppe's driving expertise
would have been worthless.
However, Thomas was prepared for westbound
winds shortly after liftoff, and soon the winds
shifted to the east and the race was on. Thomas, an
airport owner in Michigan, spent many days with
a weather forecaster pouring over meteorological
charts before his attempt to break the coast-to
coast balloon record of 41 days, set by publisher
Malcolm Forbes.
Thomas says he can do it in less than two weeks.
Thomas' first major venture in a balloon was
last year when his "Spirit of '76" helium-filled
balloon left the Atlantic coast bound for Europe,
but went down in a thunderstorm on the morning
of the second day. Thomas, having lost all his gear
except a life raft and signal flare, was rescued four
days later by a passing Russian freighter.
