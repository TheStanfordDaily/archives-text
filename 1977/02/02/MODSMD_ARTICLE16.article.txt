## Ruetz: policies in athletics 
### Debbie Carlton 
Money makes the world — and "Ivory
Towers" — go around, as Joe Ruetz, Stan
ford's Athletic Director can attest to. As ad
ministrator of one of the country's most pre
stigious athletic departments, Ruetz must
balance the continuing demand for well
developed athletic programs with fiscal re
ality.
"I'm torn between two roles that are in
constant conflict," Ruetz stated. "I'm a
businessman on one hand, and an educator
on the other."
As such, he does not please all of the
people all of the time, as evidenced by a
chorus of Ruetz-directed booing at the re
cent Stanford-UCLA basketball game.
"You've got to have thick skin to be in my
position," he admitted.
Ruetz has recently come under fire for
athletic policies which dropped, after
budget cuts, varsity wrestling and junior
varsity basketball teams, and yet which
somehow found the resourced to buy out the
remainder of football coach Jack Christian
sen's contract and hire a new coach with a
$6,000 a year increase.
1 o clear the air, Ruetz explained the con
troversial decision, and elaborated on his
own position concerning other athletic
policies.
Contrary to earlier rumors, the money
used to buy out Christiansen's contract did
not come from wealthy and irate alumni. It
came from an athletic department "reserve
fund" built up by successful football gate
receipts and income from televised games.
The fund can be tapped with University
trustee authorization, which was given
under pressure from the Stanford commun
ity — and wealthy and irate alumni.
The decision was made for the continued
health of the football program, which, as the
main source of departmental revenue be
sides donations, crucially affects other
Stanford sports programs.
Football revenue, however, cannot be de
pended upon. Factors like rain, a poor team
and a lack of television coverage all reduce
potential income considerably.
Thus, explained Ruetz, "You must
budget conservatively. We try to budget so
we don't show a profit."
The cuts affecting JV basketball and
wrestling were made before it was known

that there was money "leftover."
"It's not that we're looking for ways to
spend money," stated Ruetz. "We felt there
was sufficient income to buy out Jack Chris
tiansen's contract."
He added, "You really don't have time for
a participatory democracy. You make a de
cision like this after careful reflection."
Ruetz further explained that the new
football coach's salary increase "was neces
sary when you're dealing with today's mar
ket inflation and when you're going after
clearly superior people with great reputa
tions."
As for the decision to cut the wrestling
program, Ruetz cited the "relative lack of
interest in wrestling" when compared to
gymnastics, a sport which includes men's
and women's participation at the P.E. and
competitive levels.
"I'm not against wrestling," Ruetz stated.
"Our real problem is sheer lack of indoor
facilities for men's programs alone, added
to the Title IX pressure to develop women's
programs." He added, "What we need de
sperately is another major facility — with
locker and training rooms and office space."
He estimated that such a facility would
cost $15 mil lion to build. Research on such
a facility is currently underway.
The lack of space has thwarted de
partmental attempts to expand current
sports, and add others.
"One of the things we would love to do is
have JV teams for all sports," Ruetz stated.
Hut this, along with the "constant demand
to upgrade programs to varsity status (for
example, women's volleyball and gymnas
tics) presents a pressure which he "must
resist very mightily" given financial limita
tions.
A new facility would be costly to build as
well as to operate. But an even bigger prob
lem is hiring new coaches and personnel for
new programs.
"The big cost is not in team travel and so
on, but in salaries," explained Ruetz. "The
only way you can fundamentally reduce
costs is to drop people, which means you
droj) programs."
Ruetz acknowledged that financial con
siderations determine athletic priorities,
and that the factors giving wings to one
sport may ground another.

"You're caught in the public syndrome,"
he stated. "You have great spectator interest
in basketball and football, which generated
needed income. Sports like volleyball must
compete with sports like basketball for
spectator interest."
However, he expressed his commitment
to promoting interest in less financially re
warding programs. "We're trying to do ev
erything we can to publicize the other
sports," he stated.
Another controversial issue, and an in
creasingly divisive one in the NCAA, is the
determination of athletic scholarships.
Ruetz, unlike many of his fellow NCAA
members, advocates the "Need Formula,"
which awards scholarships based on finan
cial need rather than recruiting top athletes
by offering free rides regardless of financial
status.
"I'm not trying to sell the Need Formula
from Stanford's position," Ruetz said. "I see
it as a means of saving the University money
without destroying athletic programs."
Opposition to the Need Formual is based
largely on fear of recruiting violations and
"under the table payments." Stated Ruetz,
"It doesn't really bother me one way or the
other. I'm not going to push it — 1 don't
want to destroy the NCAA."
Ruetz also discussed athletic policies
concerning women's programs. He feels
that the major problem for women is in re
cruiting. He said, "We're faced with several
hurdles that make it impossible to treat men
and women equally."
The Association for Intercollegiate Athle
tics for Women (AIAW) will not allow
female athletes to be recruited in the same
way that men are.
"You're talking about a commitment of
about $25,000 for one athlete for four
years." Ruetz pointed out, "It's important to
conduct a very careful and detailed screen
ing process."
Ruetz feels that the reason for different
recruiting rules for women stems from re
cruiting's image as a "vicious process."
"I completely disagree with this," he
stated. "Recruiting should not be a nasty
word — it depends on who's doing it and
the methods used, but it can be a very posi
tive process." He added, "We're trying to
keep recruiting on a very high plane."
