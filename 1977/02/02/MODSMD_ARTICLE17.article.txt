# Card netters breeze by Santa Clara
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Last year five members of the
women's tennis team, (Lee
Forood, Marcy O'keefe, Susie
Hagey, Barbara Jordan and
Diane Morrison) made the All-
American team. Coach Anne
Hill was excited that all five
were eligible to return to the
Farm for this season. But funny
things have happened since the
Cards' second place finish in
Salt Lake City last June.
In September, at the U.S. Open
at Forest Hills, Forood decided
to play for bucks instead of Stan
ford and turned pro. In De
cember, O'Keefe left the team for
personal reasons.
In addition, Susie Hagey is
taking winter quarter off to play
tournament tennis and Barb Jor
dan is resting a sore shoulder.
And when Card women took

on Santa Clara yesterday, Diane
Morrison was the only All -
American in the line-up.
TheCards still crunched Santa
Clara 8-1. The score does not
show the domination the Cards
showed on the court, though. In
singles, the Cards won 86 per
cent of the games played, and the
only loss was in three sets of a
doubles match and that was
being played far after the out
come had been decided. This
was the first match of the season
and the second year Coach Hill
was "pleased" with the results.
Morrison, the defending col
legiate doubles champion with
partner Susie Hagey, played an
outstanding match in breezing
past Kelly O'Keefe (Marcy's sis
ter) 6-2,6-1. With one of the
finest volleys in women's col
lege tennis in her repetoire, she

served and volleyed to an easy
victory. Holding her serve
throughout the match with such
ease, Morrison never allowed
O'Keefe even a break point.
An awesome performance like
the one just mentioned is hard to
follow, but Nancy Rudd, playing
No. 2 did a pretty good follow-up
job, wiping up Tammy
Teichgraeber 6-0, 6-1.
Rudd has a strong backcourt
game. She seems to get to almost
every ball and one can almost
count the number of errors in a
match on one hand.
Yesterday she was just too
steady for Teichgraeber. Her ac
curate placements forced
Teichgraeber into repeated er
rujs. Rudd's game is of
such quality that she is a definite
possibility for this year's All-
American team.

In the third position, Nancy
Anderson started slowly, win
ning the first set 6-4, hut once on
track she was unstoppable and
won the second set 6-0.
Marianne Ingard makes tennis
look so easy, but made things
hard for Liz Fernandez and
sailed to a 6-1, 6-1 victory.
No. 5 Pat Varga clocked Mary
Gibbs 6-1, 6-1, and Pat Delaney
wasted no time in posting a per
fect 6-0, 6-0 victory over Joan
Pringle.
In doubles, O'Keefe and T.
Teichgaeber spoiled the Card's
shutout by surprising Rudd and
Anderson 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.
Pam Gardiner and Sally
Thompson whipped D.
Teichgraeber and Fernandez
6-1, 6-3 in their first match for
Stanford.
Carolyn Nichols and Lee Ann
Johnson, down 4-2 in the second
set, won a key three-all point and
then took the set to win 6-4, 7-5.
In all it was a rather impres
sive performance by the whole
team, but they have no time to
celebrate because the Santa Bar
bara Invitational Tournament is
awaiting them this weekend.
However, if yesterday's perfor
mance is any indication of the
strength of the team, the national
crown just might belong to Stan
ford this year.
