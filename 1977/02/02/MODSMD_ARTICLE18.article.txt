There's no doubt about it.
Tom Schmalzried sticks out in a crowd.
The 6-IOV2, 215 pound freshman center
for the Cards has become synonymous
with the words hustle, intensity and de
termination.
"Probably his biggest plus," comments
Coach Dißiaso, "is his desire to be a good
basketball player. He shoots well for a
man his size and he rebounds well, but he
has an incredible attitude that lets him
constantly accept constructive criticism.
All he needs now is game experience and
he's getting it."
As Tom himself puts it,"I want to con
tribute to the team very badly. I'd stay out
in the locker room until they called me
out if that's how they wanted to play me. I
just want to play and feel like I'm con
tributing."
Those contributions include coming
off the bench as sixth man and logging
about 20 minutes per game in addition to
canning 5.7 points and taking 4.7 re
bounds in an average game. Characteris
ticly, Tom is not satisfied with these
statistics.
"I don't think I've played well at all,"
he says."I really haven't put together a
good shooting night except for the Wis
consin game (his high game with 14
points). I think of myself as a shooter and
those are the figures I usually look at.
"I also feel that I have to learn to move
away from the ball, and go inside with my
power moves. In high school, I played a
post position with my back to the basket
and I could stand around and let them
bring me the ball.
"But here, the pace is much quicker and
the players are all big, strong and quick. I
have to learn to do different tilings, like
play on the perimeter and move without

the ball."
Some things have been pleasing to
Schinalzried's critical eye. Defense, for
example, is a specialty he engages in,
with a tight aggressive guard down the
opposition middle.
"1 seem to be able to come off the bench
and play defense," he comments. "I'm
able to knock the ball away from their
inside man, guard him and clog things
up. I can't say it's a real strong point of my
game, but it's something we're working
on."
It was different a year ago in high
school. A two-time All Starer at Cardinal
Gibbons High School in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida, Schmalzried was on Coach and
Athlete magazine's Top 100 prep players
in the nation.
Letters from colleges were rolling in,
and he had his pick of almost countless
scholarship offers.
"I enjoyed it,"says Schmalzried, refer
ring to the recruiting. "It was a chance to
be able to do what I wanted and where I
wanted without worrying where the
money was coming.
"About the only place I didn't get re
cruited was UCLA. It would have been
flattering to have gotten an offer from
them, but I never would have seriously
considered going there."
He did, however, consider Duke, Wake
Forest, Florida University, Vanderbilt
and Stanford, all schools with good
academic programs as well as a good
medical school. Yet, four of his final
choices were back East, close to his fam
ily, while Stanford was way out on the
West Coast.
Why did he go so far away from home?
The answer was he didn't.
"I consider Palo Alto to be my home,"
declares Schmalzried. "1 used to live here

before high school, just a lew minutes
away. It was foronly IB months, but it was
enough for me to fall in love with the Bay
Area."
Thus, it was easy tor Schmalzried to
move away, greet old friends and renew
his love affair with Northern California.
Unfortunately, the West Cost didn't re
turn the favor as he stepped oft his plane.
"It was raining," he recalls, "and 1 was
really bummed. I said to myself, 'What a
drag! I didn't come here for this!'
Tentatively, Schmalzried plans to be a
premed, with an eye toward orthopedic
surgery. Although still undeclared, he is
contemplating a major in human biology.
Of course at the present, his main con
cern is basketball, as he spends much of
his free time with other team members.
"We have a tremendous team attitude,"
he explains. "We're close, really close.
We do most everything together and we
feel that's one of our biggest assets."
Coach Dißiaso agrees, saying "Tom
gets along well with the rest of the team.
He's an outgoing, confident young man.
He encourages the other players, kids
around with them, and keeps them
loose."
"He said that about me?" replies
Schmalzried. "Well, yeah, but it's more
unconscious than conscious. I clown
around a lot and fool with the guys. Like
when we're shooting layups, 1 carry on
like the radio announcers and stuff like
that."
He gets this lightheadedness back, too,
as he is affectionately known as "Dennis
the Menace" on the team for his cowlick
which blooms out his deranged head of
hair every time he plays.
"Sometimes it's just 'The Menace,' " he
grins, "because of my tendency to get in
there and foul."
