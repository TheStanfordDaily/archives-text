# Medical Center waits for accreditation
## 
### Karen Wada 
The Medical Center is in a "serious
and urgent" situation as it waits for
reaccreditation, according to Dr.
Clayton Rich, vice president of medi
cal affairs.
Last month, the Joint Commission
on Hospital Accreditation (JCHA) re
viewed the center and reported many
administrative and procedural prob
lems. The JCHA has yet to announce
whether it will reaccredit the center.
In 1975 and 1976, the center re
ceived one-year accreditations. Ac
cording to a JCHA spokesperson, one
year terms are issued instead of two
year terms when a hospital has de
ficiencies that the JCHA believes can
be corrected within a year.
The center's present situation re
quires "an extraordinary effort which
cuts through normal channels," Dr.
Rich said.
Discrepancies
The previous short-term accredita
tions were caused by discrepancies
with JCHA guidelines, Dr. Rich said.
Some discrepancies still remain, he

added, and require immediate correc
tion.
Rich also called for an ongoing audit
to keep the hospital up-to-date with
accrediting agency standards.
"Any other course will place the
hospital in a new long-term jeopardy,"
he warned.
The JCHA listed deficiency areas in
Stanford's Hospital and Medical Staff
operation, including
—corporate bylaws;
—medical staff bylaws;
—medical staff privileges and re
view;
—quality control and service re
sponsibilities within the medical staff;
—departmental meetings;
—medical and other records;
—policies and procedures of several
departments; and
—aspects of physical facilities that
no longer comply with code.
Total review
The "code" includes recently re
vised State Department of Health,
California Medical Association, and
JCHA requirements.

Dr. Rich said so many rules have
changed since the hospital was built
that a total review of pol icy and proce
dure is needed.
" JCH A had a lot of deficiences for us,
but we can correct them," Dr. Rich
explained. "Mainly, they were con
cerned with out requirements for med
ical staff qualifications, and our medi
cal staff bylaws.
"We don't review the staff qualifica
tions as frequently as JCHA requires,"
he said. "We don't fall into their pat
terns for recommendations and proce
dures for appointment of staff."
Bylaw trouble stems from material
currently under revision by the
tal because it has been outdated by
JCHA and Department of Health rule
changes, Dr. Rich said. Because Med
Center doctors are employed in diffe
rent ways, the administrative situation
is very complex, Rich said.
Private practice
"Our med staff consists of doctors in
private practice, some on the clinical
faculty, and some full time faculty
members," he noted.

"That group is supposed to form its
bylaws to insure high quality of
medicine and to meet its needs as a
body. The bylaws must be approved by
the staff and by the hospital board of
directors."
Dr. Rich outlined the medical staff
structure, explaining that neither pri
vate nor university doctors are hired
by the hospital. Physicians are ap
pointed to the staff and charge and col
lect their own fees.

vate nor university doctors are hired
by the hospital. Physicians are ap
pointed to the staff and charge and col
lect their own fees.
The Medical Center is in a "serious
and urgent" situation as it waits for
reaccreditation, according to Dr.
Clayton Rich, vice president of medi
cal affairs.
Last month, the Joint Commission
on Hospital Accreditation (JCHA) re
viewed the center and reported many
administrative and procedural prob
lems. The JCHA has yet to announce
whether it will reaccredit the center.
In 1975 and 1976, the center re
ceived one-year accreditations. Ac
cording to a JCHA spokesperson, one
year terms are issued instead of two
year terms when a hospital has de
ficiencies that the JCHA believes can
be corrected within a year.
The center's present situation re
quires "an extraordinary effort which
cuts through normal channels," Dr.
Rich said.
Discrepancies
The previous short-term accredita
tions were caused by discrepancies
with JCHA guidelines, Dr. Rich said.
Some discrepancies still remain, he

added, and require immediate correc
tion.
Rich also called for an ongoing audit
to keep the hospital up-to-date with
accrediting agency standards.
"Any other course will place the
hospital in a new long-term jeopardy,"
he warned.
The JCHA listed deficiency areas in
Stanford's Hospital and Medical Staff
operation, including
—corporate bylaws;
—medical staff bylaws;
—medical staff privileges and re
view;
—quality control and service re
sponsibilities within the medical staff;
—departmental meetings;
—medical and other records;
—policies and procedures of several
departments; and
—aspects of physical facilities that
no longer comply with code.
Total review
The "code" includes recently re
vised State Department of Health,
California Medical Association, and
JCHA requirements.

Dr. Rich said so many rules have
changed since the hospital was built
that a total review of pol icy and proce
dure is needed.
" JCH A had a lot of deficiences for us,
but we can correct them," Dr. Rich
explained. "Mainly, they were con
cerned with out requirements for med
ical staff qualifications, and our medi
cal staff bylaws.
"We don't review the staff qualifica
tions as frequently as JCHA requires,"
he said. "We don't fall into their pat
terns for recommendations and proce
dures for appointment of staff."
Bylaw trouble stems from material
currently under revision by the
tal because it has been outdated by
JCHA and Department of Health rule
changes, Dr. Rich said. Because Med
Center doctors are employed in diffe
rent ways, the administrative situation
is very complex, Rich said.
Private practice
"Our med staff consists of doctors in
private practice, some on the clinical
faculty, and some full time faculty
members," he noted.

"That group is supposed to form its
bylaws to insure high quality of
medicine and to meet its needs as a
body. The bylaws must be approved by
the staff and by the hospital board of
directors."
Dr. Rich outlined the medical staff
structure, explaining that neither pri
vate nor university doctors are hired
by the hospital. Physicians are ap
pointed to the staff and charge and col
lect their own fees.
