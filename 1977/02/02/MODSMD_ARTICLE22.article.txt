Marin County water rationing begins
San Rafael — Parched Marin County began a stringent
water rationing program yesterday, ordering the county's
180,000 residents to cut their water consumption by more
than half — to 46 gallons per person each per day.
Rationing by the Marin Municipal Water District, aimed
at slowing the rapid drain on reservoirs that are now only
one-fourth full, will be voluntary for two months. After
that, water use will be strictly monitored and the tap
turned off on chronic abusers.
House, Senate agree on natural gas
Washington — House and Senate conferees agreed on
compromise emergency natural gas legislation last night,
apparently breaking an impasse that had threatened to
delay enactment of the legislation sought by President

Jimmy Carter.
Under the compromise, hammered out by a House-
Senate conference committee which met for less than half
an hour, the House would abandon its effort to put a price
ceiling provision in the bill.
Cuban troops allowed into Tanzania
Washington — Tanzania, one of the African countries
U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young will visit this week, is
allowing Cuban troops to train black Rhodesian guerrillas,
U.S. intelligence sources say.
President Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance have indicated disapproval of the Cuban troops
presence in Angola, saying outside intervention is not
helpful and that an African solution should be reached by
Africans.
Young has shown a markedly different view.
In an interview on CBS last week, Young said "there's a
sense in which the Cubans bring a certain stability and
order to Angola."
He added that there were white South African troops in
Angola as well, which he said justified the use of Cuban
forces.
Energy head urges nuclear power use
Paris — The outgoing president of the International
Energy Agency said yesterday the world must use nuclear
power to meet its energy needs over the next 10 to 15 years
despite public concern about its safety.
Viscount Etienne Davignon said intensive research and
development must continue into alternative energy
sources such as solar power, but meanwhile nuclear
energy would have to be used.

Marin County water rationing begins
San Rafael — Parched Marin County began a stringent
water rationing program yesterday, ordering the county's
180,000 residents to cut their water consumption by more
than half — to 46 gallons per person each per day.
Rationing by the Marin Municipal Water District, aimed
at slowing the rapid drain on reservoirs that are now only
one-fourth full, will be voluntary for two months. After
that, water use will be strictly monitored and the tap
turned off on chronic abusers.
House, Senate agree on natural gas
Washington — House and Senate conferees agreed on
compromise emergency natural gas legislation last night,
apparently breaking an impasse that had threatened to
delay enactment of the legislation sought by President

Jimmy Carter.
Under the compromise, hammered out by a House-
Senate conference committee which met for less than half
an hour, the House would abandon its effort to put a price
ceiling provision in the bill.
Cuban troops allowed into Tanzania
Washington — Tanzania, one of the African countries
U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young will visit this week, is
allowing Cuban troops to train black Rhodesian guerrillas,
U.S. intelligence sources say.
President Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance have indicated disapproval of the Cuban troops
presence in Angola, saying outside intervention is not
helpful and that an African solution should be reached by
Africans.
Young has shown a markedly different view.
In an interview on CBS last week, Young said "there's a
sense in which the Cubans bring a certain stability and
order to Angola."
He added that there were white South African troops in
Angola as well, which he said justified the use of Cuban
forces.
Energy head urges nuclear power use
Paris — The outgoing president of the International
Energy Agency said yesterday the world must use nuclear
power to meet its energy needs over the next 10 to 15 years
despite public concern about its safety.
Viscount Etienne Davignon said intensive research and
development must continue into alternative energy
sources such as solar power, but meanwhile nuclear
energy would have to be used.
