# Trouble at SLAC
## Picket lines stir controversy 
### Randy Keith 
The University has filed a protest
with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) claiming that picket
lines set up Monday at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC) by Local
377 of the International Association of
Bridge, Structural and Ornamental
Ironworkers and Riggers are a secon
dary boycott.
According to a union official, the
picket lines were set up to "inform"
the public about what he called viola
tions of "affirmative action rules...and
OSHA (safety) regulations" by the Sol
ano County Construction Co.. a non
union subcontractor working on the
SLAC expansion project.
The official said the union claims
the subcontractor "does not hire

minorities," thus violating affirmative
action rules and that OSHA rules are
broken because workers have "no
safety belts and insufficient tools."
In addition, he charged that "the
University and SLAC do not follow the
affirmative action rules" and that they
have a "double set of standards" for
union and nonunion contractors.
Gay DeVries, owner of the Solano
County Construction Co., said she
"wasn't aware" she was in violation of
affirmative action regulations until
Monday and that she "would take
steps to remedy it immediately." She
added that a qualified minority worker
would be hired by the end of the week.
She also said she was "sure we are in
compliance" with OSHA regulations.
According to Bernard Lighthouse,

Personnel Manager at SLAC, picket
lines prevented some supplies from
reaching SI.AC! yesterday when about
25 trucks turned away.
He added that some SLAC projects
are being affected by a lack of supplies,
primarily various forms of gasses, but
that the exact extent of the problem is
"difficult to determine at this time."
Lighthouse also said that any delays
caused now by a lack of supplies
would hinder work "down the line"
since SLAC projects are on tight
schedules.
University Assoc. Staff Counsel,
Cerald Halligan, said the "professed
intent of Local 377 is to force Stanford
and M & H Construction Co. (the con
tractor for which Solano is a subcon
tractor) to hire union workers".
