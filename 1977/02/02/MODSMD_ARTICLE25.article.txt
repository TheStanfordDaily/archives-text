Delta Tau Delta fraternity may fold if the University
rejects its petition for reinstatement this year, Delt presi
dent Eric Grunseth said on KZSU's Campus Conference
last night.
The Delts were suspended from their on-campus house
last May after an incident resulting in damage to the Beta
Theta Pi house.
"I believe that unless we get on next year, we will be
hard pressed to keep our membership and to keep our
house," Grunseth said.
Grunseth said, however, that he did not feel that the
University was trying to keep Delts off campus in order to
force them to fold.
He said he felt the frat suffered unfoundedly from a poor
image. "The Delts are low-keyed," he said, "compared
with other fraternities on other campuses."
Grunseth said many of the acts last May were "typical
fraternity pranks" blown out of proportion because of the

noteriety of the Delt membership.
"Since the Delt house is made up of a lot of athletes . . .
they draw a lot of attention, so when something comes up,
and they're involved, everyone is familiar with their name
already, and the thing is blown up further and further."
He said Delt members are stereotyped because of the past
record of the frat. "I think a lot of times, the person making
the decision (to suspend the Delts) looked back at the past
and felt that these were reminiscent problems," Grunseth
said.
Biases, he maintained, resulted from an earlier suspen
sion of the frat in May 1973. The problem arose, however,
years before when Stanford victories in the Rose Howl
gave the predominately athletic Delt membership an at
titude that "they could do anything they wanted," Grun
seth said.
He said the University turned its back on some acts it
shouldn't have ignored during that period because of the
impracticality of suspending a winning football team's
players.
