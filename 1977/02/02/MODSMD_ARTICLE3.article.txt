# Not enough hard data
## Chemists wary of DNA research 
### Marc Strassman 
There is still not enough hard data to
decide whether the recently promul
gated guidelines for recombinant DNA
research are adequate to protect the
community from potential biological
hazards, several speakers said last
night.
According to a number of commun
ity members who addressed an over
flow crowd of 500 in the new Sherman
Fairchild Center Auditorium, how
ever, the dangers are great enough to
demand safeguards even more strin
gent than those called for in recently
adopted National Institutes of Health
(NIH) guidelines.

The guidelines were adopted here
by the Administrative Panel on Re
combinant DNA Research, which
sponsored the meeting along with
Vice-Provost for Research William
Massey, the meeting's moderator.
Biochemistry Prof. Paul Berg out
lined the history of the guidelines and
said, "I believe that the NIH guidelines
are sufficient to meet the perceived
risks." He expressed concern that by
making the guidelines too strict, "we
may have already squelched the scien
tists of tomorrow."
David Clem, a Ph.D. candidate in
urban planning at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, spoke about

the Cambridge Experimental Laborat
ory Review Board, which has recom
mended that additional guidelines be
imposed on recombinant DNA re
search there.
Clem said that the example of the
Atomic Energy Commission has
shown that an agency charged with
promulgating a research activity can
not also be given the responsibility of
regulating it.
"I do not trust the Harvards or the
MITs or the Stanfords to police their
own activities," he said.
Richard Goldstein, a microbiologist
from Harvard, said that in transferring
tens of thousands of genes from one
cell to another, researchers were "cod
ing for enormous numbers of proteins"
and that the results are "not at all pre
dictable."
Goldstein warned that the same mu
tated bacteria scientists hope to de
velop to clean up oil spills might find
their way into aircraft lubrication sys
tems with dangerous effects.
He said he was worried that recom
binant bacteria designed to eliminate
pollution from the world's oceans
might also eliminate the blue-green
algae that provide 00 per cent of the
world's oxygen.
He said, "I don't know anyone who's
signed an informed consent state
ment" for the research.
Prof, of Medicine Halstead Holman
said it was unrealistic to expect safety
from the use of "enfeebled" strains of
E. coli bacteria in recombinant re
search, since E. coli infections have
recently been increasing among popu
lations with low immunity.
Holman called attention to the dan
gers of conducting recombinant re
search close to hospitals, and said that
"certain elements of prudence dictate
that we ought to take a look at" the
juxtaposition of low-immunity popu
lations and recombinant research.
David Thom, a member of the Al
liance for Radical Change, called for a
moratorium on recombinant DNA re
search here, saying that the public po
tentially being effected by the re
search, and not those who stand to be
nefit financially from it, should have
the authority to regulate or prohibit it.

shown that an agency charged with
promulgating a research activity can
not also be given the responsibility of
regulating it.
"I do not trust the Harvards or the
MITs or the Stanfords to police their
own activities," he said.
Richard Goldstein, a microbiologist
from Harvard, said that in transferring
tens of thousands of genes from one
cell to another, researchers were "cod
ing for enormous numbers of proteins"
and that the results are "not at all pre
dictable."
Goldstein warned that the same mu
tated bacteria scientists hope to de
velop to clean up oil spills might find
their way into aircraft lubrication sys
tems with dangerous effects.
He said he was worried that recom
binant bacteria designed to eliminate
pollution from the world's oceans
might also eliminate the blue-green
algae that provide 00 per cent of the
world's oxygen.
He said, "I don't know anyone who's
signed an informed consent state
ment" for the research.
Prof, of Medicine Halstead Holman
said it was unrealistic to expect safety
from the use of "enfeebled" strains of
E. coli bacteria in recombinant re
search, since E. coli infections have
recently been increasing among popu
lations with low immunity.
Holman called attention to the dan
gers of conducting recombinant re
search close to hospitals, and said that
"certain elements of prudence dictate
that we ought to take a look at" the
juxtaposition of low-immunity popu
lations and recombinant research.
David Thom, a member of the Al
liance for Radical Change, called for a
moratorium on recombinant DNA re
search here, saying that the public po
tentially being effected by the re
search, and not those who stand to be
nefit financially from it, should have
the authority to regulate or prohibit it.
There is still not enough hard data to
decide whether the recently promul
gated guidelines for recombinant DNA
research are adequate to protect the
community from potential biological
hazards, several speakers said last
night.
According to a number of commun
ity members who addressed an over
flow crowd of 500 in the new Sherman
Fairchild Center Auditorium, how
ever, the dangers are great enough to
demand safeguards even more strin
gent than those called for in recently
adopted National Institutes of Health
(NIH) guidelines.

The guidelines were adopted here
by the Administrative Panel on Re
combinant DNA Research, which
sponsored the meeting along with
Vice-Provost for Research William
Massey, the meeting's moderator.
Biochemistry Prof. Paul Berg out
lined the history of the guidelines and
said, "I believe that the NIH guidelines
are sufficient to meet the perceived
risks." He expressed concern that by
making the guidelines too strict, "we
may have already squelched the scien
tists of tomorrow."
David Clem, a Ph.D. candidate in
urban planning at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, spoke about

the Cambridge Experimental Laborat
ory Review Board, which has recom
mended that additional guidelines be
imposed on recombinant DNA re
search there.
Clem said that the example of the
Atomic Energy Commission has
shown that an agency charged with
promulgating a research activity can
not also be given the responsibility of
regulating it.
