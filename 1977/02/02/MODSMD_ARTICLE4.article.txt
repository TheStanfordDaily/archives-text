# Self-help requirement may be raised by $200
## 
### Doug Hyde 
Students might have to contribute
up to $200 more in self-help on their
financial aid packages if the Commit
tee for Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (CAUFA) approves
such a measure Friday.
Robert Huff, director of financial
aid, has recommended the increase in
self-help.
The self-help expectation is the
amount of tuition and other expenses
not covered by scholarships. Parents
provide much of this money while ad
ditional sums are taken in loans, paid
for through the work-study program or
earned during summer jobs.
If Huff's recommendation is en
dorsed, all students now receiving fi
nancial aid would have to increase
their self-help payments by $200.
Self-help requirements for entering
students from the low-income categ
ory would rise $100.
According to Huff, total payments
will depend on the category under
which a financial recipient falls. Those
academically in the top 5-10 per cent
category will have to pay $HOO of self
help. Those in the diversity category
will have to pay $1300. Those in the
so-called majority category will have
to pay $1750.

In all categories, minority students
pay 20 per cent less.
Part of this increase will be offset by
an increase of 20 to 25 cents in hourly
wages for work-study employment.
"We expect $50 of the $200 to come
from higher wages," said Huff. He
added this would not force work-study
students to work more hours during
the week.
"The rest of the money will be of
fered in terms of long-term loans pay
able after graduation," he said.
Huff cited economic reasons for the
increase. The cost of education here is
expected to increase $600 for next
year. Increased tuition will account for
$420 of this, increased room and board
costs for $130, and an increase in the
price of books for $50.
Huff said he felt part of this increase
should be made up by increasing the
self-help expectations.
If CAUFA endorses the recommen
dation, it will be the second rise in
self-help expectations in two years.
Last year the increase was $150.
Not all members of CUAFA are
pleased with Huff's recommendation.
"It's a matter of priorities in spend
ing," said Edward Sosa, a student
member of the committee.
Sosa said that Stanford "should see the need to do a
better job" than the East Coast schools.
He added that we will probably see "more rises in the
next couple of years."
Also on the agenda for Friday's meeting will be a dis
cussion about nonbase scholarships, said English Proi.

aid, has recommended the increase in
self-help.
The self-help expectation is the
amount of tuition and other expenses
not covered by scholarships. Parents
provide much of this money while ad
ditional sums are taken in loans, paid
for through the work-study program or
earned during summer jobs.
If Huff's recommendation is en
dorsed, all students now receiving fi
nancial aid would have to increase
their self-help payments by $200.
Self-help requirements for entering
students from the low-income categ
ory would rise $100.
According to Huff, total payments
will depend on the category under
which a financial recipient falls. Those
academically in the top 5-10 per cent
category will have to pay $HOO of self
help. Those in the diversity category
will have to pay $1300. Those in the
so-called majority category will have
to pay $1750.

In all categories, minority students
pay 20 per cent less.
Part of this increase will be offset by
an increase of 20 to 25 cents in hourly
wages for work-study employment.
"We expect $50 of the $200 to come
from higher wages," said Huff. He
added this would not force work-study
students to work more hours during
the week.
"The rest of the money will be of
fered in terms of long-term loans pay
able after graduation," he said.
Huff cited economic reasons for the
increase. The cost of education here is
expected to increase $600 for next
year. Increased tuition will account for
$420 of this, increased room and board
costs for $130, and an increase in the
price of books for $50.
Huff said he felt part of this increase
should be made up by increasing the
self-help expectations.
If CAUFA endorses the recommen
dation, it will be the second rise in
self-help expectations in two years.
Last year the increase was $150.
Not all members of CUAFA are
pleased with Huff's recommendation.
"It's a matter of priorities in spend
ing," said Edward Sosa, a student
member of the committee.
Sosa said that Stanford "should see the need to do a
better job" than the East Coast schools.
He added that we will probably see "more rises in the
next couple of years."
Also on the agenda for Friday's meeting will be a dis
cussion about nonbase scholarships, said English Proi.
William Chace, chairman of CAUFA.
Nonbase scholarships are scholarships awarded inde
pendent of need, traditionally to top academic students.
Students might have to contribute
up to $200 more in self-help on their
financial aid packages if the Commit
tee for Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (CAUFA) approves
such a measure Friday.
