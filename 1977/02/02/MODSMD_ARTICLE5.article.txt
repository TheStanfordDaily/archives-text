## ASSU task force urges $1000 teaching bonus 
### Kathy Trafton 
Faculty members may be eligible to
receive a special $1000 salary increase
for excellent teaching if a recommen
dation of the ASSU Task Force on Te
nure and Teaching Quality is adopted.
The report, released today,
suggested that a special committee be
formed to review faculty members
once every seven years in order to
issue the awards. The report also re
commended that:
—every course be evaluated by stu
dents every time it is offered;
—surveys be conducted among
seniors and recent alumni to assess the
long-term value of courses and of ad
vising;
—a new committee of the Academic
Senate be set up for the comparative
assessment of teaching in the Schools
of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences and Engineering;
—all search committees for new pro
fessors gather the most detailed ap
praisal possible of the candidates'
teaching qualities.
10 members
The student appointed task force
consists of 10 members: four students,
four professors and two adminis
trators.

Student interest in the relationship
between the quality of teaching and
the criteria used for determining te
nure promotions has increased re
cently after some popular teachers
failed to gain tenure, the report also
said.
Faculty and administrators are also
sensitive to these concerns, the report
said, quoting Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Fred Hargadon: "A repa
tation for excellence in teaching is
what attracts first-rate students to the
University, and perceived lack of ex
cellence will lead them away from this
University."
Pass it on
The report will be considered by the
Subcommittee on the Evaluation of
Teaching, which will pass it on to the
Committee of Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA). TheCAAA will
then make recommendations concern
ing teaching and tenure to the Faculty
Senate this quarter or next spring, ac
cording to Larry Diamond, a former
student body president here who
headed the task force.
The task force found no evidence
that good teaching and good research
are necessarily conflicting pursuits.
'Heart of the problem'
"The heart of the problem is simply
this: While teaching and research are
discussed symmetrically in many pol
icy statements, they are handled
asymmetrically in tenure and promo
tion hearings, with research in prac
tice being accorded more weight than
teaching," the report said.
However, "the majority of the fa
culty has repeatedly indicated a pre
ference for an increase in the weight
given to teaching.
"Clearly, then, there exists a sub
stantial discrepancy between how the
faculty think tenure and promotion
decisions should be made and how
they feel the decisions actually are

made," the report asserted.
Two-thirds of the faculty sampled
said that the phrase "publish or
perish" describes their present or past
situation here in an "accurate" or
"very accurate" manner.
Strict guidelines
Tenure committees provide strict
guidelines for documentation of re
search done, but "no particular form of
documentation is required on a
University-wide basis for the evalua
tion of teaching," the report noted.
In order to balance research and
teaching factors in faculty appoint
ments, promotions and salaries,
evaluation and rewards must be more
systematic, the task force said.
A universal course evaluation pol
icy would ensure feedback on profes
sors' classroom performance, clas
sroom preparation, accessibility to
students, prompt return of papers and
course design, according to the report.
Students tend to be overgenerous
when rating their professors, and re
trospective surveys for seniors and re
cent alumni may help counteract this
problem, the task force report main
tained.
'Mature student'
"The mature student might rank the
courses he has taken quite differently
in terms of their importance to his in
tellectual development than the way
he rated them as he was taking them,"
the report said.
"Most teaching is done by profes
sors who already have received te
nure," and salaries are an important
part of the reward structure for these
professors, according to the report.
The report proposed that about
one-quarter of the eligible faculty re
ceive an award for excellent teaching
each review year. As reviews would
occur every seven years, less than four
per cent of the total faculty every year
would receive such awards.
