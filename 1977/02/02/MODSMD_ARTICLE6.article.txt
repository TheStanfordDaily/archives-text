# Carter says to prayer breakfast: 'Reaffirm faith in Jesus Christ'
## 
### Mark Funk 
President Jimmy Carter did not pray for an end to the
cold snap that has paralyzed the east at the National
Prayer Breakfast last week.
And according to Stanford senior Paul Lundquist, he
didn't even ask for a favorable nuclear weapons agree
ment or peace in southern Africa. He merely called on
the 3700 people in attendance to admit their need for
Jesus Christ and to ask for his forgiveness.
The National Prayer Breakfast is Washington D.C.'s
official yearly renewal of the soul and reaffirmation of
faith.
Lundquist was one of 100 students invited by the
Joint Congressional Committee on Special Events to
attend.
But The Almighty notwithstanding, the new presi
dent was the central attraction at the prayer breakfast.
Much had been made of Carter's religion during the

election — he is a strict Southern Baptist who still
teaches Sunday school — and people were curious how
he would express his faith in public.
"A lot of people told me — the ones who have been to
the breakfasts before — that it was different this year,"
Lundquist said. "They attributed it to Carter's pre
sence."
Carter did something, according to Lundquist,
which past presidents have rarely done. Rather than
note the goodness and righteousness of America, he
spoke about Jesus Christ.
"For the first time the people at my table could re
member, a president spoke of the person of Jesus
Christ," Lundquist said.
Carter spent a good deal of his speech urging those
present to reject the notion of "America Superior" and
said the United States could retain world leadership by
offering its neighbors help, not domination.
