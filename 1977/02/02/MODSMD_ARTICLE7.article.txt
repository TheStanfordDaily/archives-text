## Clarify contracts 
### 
In the light of the problems the University is
having collecting payment on the National Ira
nian Radio-Television (NIRT) contract, the
University should reassess its policy of for
mulating purposefully vague work statements
in some contracts it negotiates.
On many contracts, we agree with Vice-
Provost for Research William Massy that a
vague work statement is needed to preserve
academic freedom. He claims that for research
to take'place in the "scientifically" best way,
the researcher must have a flexible contract.
However, a good share of the research con
tracts taken on by the Sponsored Projects Office
are "mission-oriented" — research with a
specific outcome desired.
Such was the situation with the NIRT con
tract. A desire to preserve academic freedom
resulted in work statement phrases like "con
tent areas for various education levels will be
identified and classified" and "production re
quirements for each content area will be esti
mated."
Perhaps all sides thought they had agreed
about the meaning of these statements when

the contract was signed. However, failure to
explicitly define "content areas" and "re
quirements" makes the work statement al
most meaningless.
Massy and Sponsored Projects Director Earl
Cilley both agree that the University relied too
much on verbal understandings. Moreover,
they indicated that unwritten agreements bet
ween the researcher and client are common.
We understand the need to demonstrate trust
between parties of a contract, yet prudence
must at some point dictate that verbal agree
ments be written down and signed so as to leave
no ambiguity. Clearly, the University must get
tougher on this requirement.
The University should attempt to get firmer
agreements on most of its contracts, especially
those dealing with mission-oriented projects. It
becomes even more important since the politi
cal channels the University uses to demand
contract payments domestically may be non
existent in foreign countries and language bar
riers make misinterpretation, hence misun
derstandings, more likely.
