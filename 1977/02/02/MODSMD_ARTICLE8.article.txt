# Death penalty constitutional
## 
### 
With last month's execution of Utah
murderer Gary Gil more, national de
bate on the question of capital
punishment has once again been
raised. As with any subject which
deals with the precious gift we call
human life, arguments on both sides
are often irrational and tend at times to
replace logic with emotion.
Central to the issue must be the ques
tion of the constitutionality of capital
punishment. Despite the arguments of
liberal jurists to the contrary, capital
punishment cannot be abolished on
the grounds that it is unconstitutional.
While its arbitrary application in indi
vidual cases may raise questions of
due process and equal protection, it
nevertheless cannot realistically be ar
gued that the intent of the framers was
to eliminate the death penalty.
The Fifth Amendment reads: "No
person shall be held to answer for a
capital. . . crime . . . nor be deprived of
life, liberty, or property without due
process of law." In other words it rec
ognizes capital crimes which have a
"due process" which can deprive a

person of "life, liberty or property."
As recently as last year the Califor
nia Supreme Court threw out the
California state law calling for the ul-

timate penalty for specified crimes,
saying in a concurring opinion that the
Eighth Amendment "clearly prohibits
capital punishment" when it prohibits
"cruel and unusual punishment."
Surely the justices do not assume
the Eighth Amendment was intended
to directly contradict the Fifth
Amendment which was adopted at
exactly the same time. Cruelty can
more accurately be described as forc
ing convicted killers to suffer long, in

determinate delays between their sen
tencing and the time the sentence is
carried out. Gary Gilmore suffered the
greatest cruelty as a result of the un
wanted efforts of the ACLU and
NAAGP to deny his wish to die as the
law required.
Further, capital punishment in
American cannot be termed unusual. It
has been a part of our system of justice
since the revolution. In the states
where it is lawful, juries continue to
impose the maximum penalty to this
very day.
A Gallup poll last month showed a
full 65 per cent of the American people
support capital punishment. This
marks a substantial increase from the
49 per cent who favored it at the ti me of
the last execution in 1967. The
California law which the court struck
down was enacted by a popular man
date of over 2-1 in 1972. Thirty-five
states now have laws which legisla
tures have written or the people have
enacted through referendum calling
for the ultimate penalty in murder
cases.
As nationally-syndicated columnist
and death penalty foe George F. Will
wrote: "Much opposition to capital
punishment is, like mine, a strong
emotion searching uneasily for satis
factory reasons to justify it. Such
reasons cannot be found in the Con
stitution."
Debate on the question of capital
punishment will continue; undoub
tedly some of it will take placeon these
pages. But discussion must center on
the deterrent value and moral value of
capital punishment. Opponents can
not ground their arguments in the con
stitutional framework — the Constitu
tion of the United States does not
mandate, but clearly permits execu
tions for capital crimes.
As the Supreme Court wrote in its
opinion in the case of Gregg v. Georgia
last summer in reference to the death
penalty: "In a democratic society the
legislatures — not the courts — are
constituted to respond to the will and
consequently the moral values of the
people."
Public opinion favoring the death
penalty has climbed steadily in this
decade, but despite hundreds of con
victions only one execution has been
carried out in the last 10 years. In light
of this, one must wonder if somehow a
breakdown in our system of democ
racy has occurred.
