# USE agent denounces food director
## 
### 
Food quality at Branner Hall is par
ticularly bad because of the presence
of Branner food service manager Janice
Marks, charged United Stanford
Employees representative Jim Berk,
last night.
Berk said that the manner in which
Marks deals with food service
employes, especially Branner cook
I.indsey Taylor, has created a "terrible
situation in the kitchen" and that food
would improve "almost overnight" if
"someone else were in charge."
Herk urged Branner residents to
form a committee to investigate ways
of improving the food quality there.
Marks said these charges were
"completely false" and that the Uni
versity is "completely aware of the
situation in the Branner kitchen and is
putting a lot of time and effort into
correcting it."
During the meeting, attended by
some 25 Branner residents, Berk,
Taylor and Branner food service
worker Shirley Bawcom urged stu
dents to "organizeand see the union as
an ally" in improving food and work
ing conditions at Branner.
Many problems seem to stem from
tension between Marks and Taylor,
which culminated in a grievance peti
tion filed with the University by
Taylor after Marks pJaced him on a
two-and-a-half day suspension. Uni
versity arbitrator and director of hous
ing Edward Scoles denied the grie
vance petition, which asked payment
for the suspension period and a prom
otion for Taylor.
After the petition denial Berk
charged that Taylor could not main
tain food quality in Branner because
Marks forced Taylor to follow recipes
exactly and because Taylor was not al
lowed "his own judgment in prepar
ing food."
According to Branner resident Jim
Isaacs, some students in the dorm in
tend to form a group to "look at both
sides of the situation and determine
the appropriateness of our involve
ment."
