# Rape a constant threat here
## 
### 
Let there be no mistake, the threat of
rape is omnipresent on Stanford cam
pus. Despite the seemingly safe at
mosphere here, reported rapes, and
many unreported ones, do occur and
they happen to women much like you
or me who have either never thought it
could "happen here" or "happen to
me."
Asst. Dean of Women's Affairs
Leah Kaplan said recently that while
there was only one reported rape last
year and two the year before, she
knows of at least three rapes that have
not been reported to police. Many
times, she said, she learns about these
rapes through the psychological ser
vices where she is a social worker.
These figures do not include the
number of assault cases with intent to
rape that are stopped before any crime

is actually committed.
It is a sad fact that innumerable
warnings may be given and women
may mentally prepare a step by step
list of things they would do if they
were ever raped. But until they are ac
tually assaulted or until someone close
to them has had such an experience,
the real horror of the crime is not
realized. Women continue to jog at
night, keep their parked cars unlocked
and walk alone in unlit areas. What
does it take to convince women of the
seriousness of rape on campus?
One positive step taken by the office
of the Dean of Student Affairs under
Kaplan's guidance has been the dis

tribution of a pamphlet titled, "What
Every Woman Should Know About
Rape," to all living areas on campus.
The target audience is all women —
students, faculty and staff. The idea
behind passing out these little
red books is to make women realize
that any freely accessible area such as
Stanford is as likely a place for rapists
to be as any city street.
In a little-heralded news conference
last week, Gapt. Walter Konar of the
Stanford Police Services and Kaplan
along with other concerned adminis
trators expressed the need for more re
porting of cfimes experienced or ob
served on dampus by witnesses in
order to facilitate capttire of violators.
Also, reporting crimes allows police to
compile data that will enable them to
focus their efforts more effectively in
the area of rape.
Kaplan said in a later interview that
one reason why women here hesitate
to report rapes is because they feel that
it is "their fault" that they walked
through a dark courtyard or failed to
lock cars and that their "stupid
ity" caused the attack to occur.
This is the wrong attitude for
women to take. Rapes or attempted
rapes which are reported immediately
enable the police to apprehend the
transgressor, especially if any accurate
description of the assailant can be
given by the victim.
Just the fact that rape prevention is
the topic of serious discussion among
University administrators is proof that
this problem cannot be ignored by
women on campus.
Director of Student Affairs Thomas
Massey is earnestly seeking to reinsti
tute the Marguerite shuttle service
during the evening between residen
tial areas and libraries.
Many times, would-be rapists flock
to the campus where there is any excel
lent chance of finding women out at

night and attempt to pass themselves
off as students.
1 do not advocate being suspicious of
every new person one meets, but I do
encourage developing awareness
among women of their vulnerability to
rape and urge conscientious practice
of simple safety precautions.
It is hard to accept the fact that
women must be constantly on their
guard against rape while on campus.
Yet, when that guard is dropped
tragedy is most likely to strike.
For the city-wise women who have
had to contend with the possibility of
rape before coming to school here, the

safety measures discussed in some de
tail in the booklet passed out by the
Office of Student Affairs are obvious,
almost second nature.
For those persons from the less
urban areas who never had to worry
about rape, robbery or other major
urban crimes, all this alarm may seem
unwarranted.
Sad as it may seem, Stanford is not
immune to sex crimes. Knowing this,
women must take precautions and be
careful. And please, tell a friend.

Let there be no mistake, the threat of
rape is omnipresent on Stanford cam
pus. Despite the seemingly safe at
mosphere here, reported rapes, and
many unreported ones, do occur and
they happen to women much like you
or me who have either never thought it
could "happen here" or "happen to
me."
Asst. Dean of Women's Affairs
Leah Kaplan said recently that while
there was only one reported rape last
year and two the year before, she
knows of at least three rapes that have
not been reported to police. Many
times, she said, she learns about these
rapes through the psychological ser
vices where she is a social worker.
These figures do not include the
number of assault cases with intent to
rape that are stopped before any crime

is actually committed.
It is a sad fact that innumerable
warnings may be given and women
may mentally prepare a step by step
list of things they would do if they
were ever raped. But until they are ac
tually assaulted or until someone close
to them has had such an experience,
the real horror of the crime is not
realized. Women continue to jog at
night, keep their parked cars unlocked
and walk alone in unlit areas. What
does it take to convince women of the
seriousness of rape on campus?
One positive step taken by the office
of the Dean of Student Affairs under
Kaplan's guidance has been the dis

tribution of a pamphlet titled, "What
Every Woman Should Know About
Rape," to all living areas on campus.
The target audience is all women —
students, faculty and staff. The idea
behind passing out these little
red books is to make women realize
that any freely accessible area such as
Stanford is as likely a place for rapists
to be as any city street.
In a little-heralded news conference
last week, Gapt. Walter Konar of the
Stanford Police Services and Kaplan
along with other concerned adminis
trators expressed the need for more re
porting of cfimes experienced or ob
served on dampus by witnesses in
order to facilitate capttire of violators.
Also, reporting crimes allows police to
compile data that will enable them to
focus their efforts more effectively in
the area of rape.
Kaplan said in a later interview that
one reason why women here hesitate
to report rapes is because they feel that
it is "their fault" that they walked
through a dark courtyard or failed to
lock cars and that their "stupid
ity" caused the attack to occur.
This is the wrong attitude for
women to take. Rapes or attempted
rapes which are reported immediately
enable the police to apprehend the
transgressor, especially if any accurate
description of the assailant can be
given by the victim.
