## 'Knock Knock' convincing 
### Don Waldron 
Joan of Arc and fairy tales are
alive and well at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco.
Knock Knock, ACT's new
comedy by Jules Feiffer, of comic
strip fame, reflects a philosophi
cal evolution from Feiffer's inci
sive political satires of the late
1960s into a new statement of
hope for the 19705. Despite the
apparent uselessness of our
lives, we must live them out with
hope, even reinventing them if
necessary.
'Knock knock,' Feiffer says:
"For the first time, I was tired of
doing thesis plays.
"I simply wanted to have a
good time. 1 was worn out by
evangelizing. 1 must have made
the assumption that there was no
point in exposing further; every
body knew everything already,
and everybody knew how bad it
was."
Knock Knock was first per
formed last January by the Circle
Repertory Company in New
York. A month after its opening,
it moved to Broadway, and won
the Tony Award tor Best Play in
1976.
1 om Moore, who directs the
ACTT production, also directed
the Broadway production of
Grease.
Knock Knock tells the tale of
Abe and Cohn, two fiftyish
Jewish hermits living out their
cynical existences in a log cabin
located in a timeless sphere of
isolation.
As the first act opens, they are
aroused from the mediocrity of
their daily lives by a knock on
the door. It is Joan of Arc, who is
on a mission to save the two men
from the eminent holocost.
Before Joan's arrival, Cohn
was the skeptical cynic, Abe the
believer. But the miracles that
occur on stage eventually con
vince Cohn that fairy tales can
come true through belief.
He is unaware of the genie
within himself until Joan's zeal
makes him believe in himself,
in her, and in her ideals.
Yet, in transforming his
characters from skeptics to be
lievers, Feiffer never loses that
sharply comical tenor which
brought his cartoons to life.
"Abe, you confuse me," Joan
laments.
"Confuse me was a Chinese
philosopher," Abe replies.
"That's Confucius."
"Confusius is a color."
"That's fuchsia."
And on and on, one non
sequitur following another.
Believable indeed are the four
actors in the ACT production.
Sydney Walker is excellent as
the crotchety Abe. You don't
even have to be from New York
to appreciate his Brooklyn ac
cent. Ray Reinhardt, who plays

Cohn, succeeds in pulling off the
transition from cynic to believer
and is convincing in his new
found zeal. Elizabeth Huddle as
Joan of Arc is perhaps too
childlike and innocent, but still
bubblingly alive. Tony Teague,
as the obnoxious wise man,
mailman, and judge, is not on
stage long enough with his
hilarious improvisations.
Robert Dahlstrom, set de
signer, deserves special recogni
tion for his magical effects. Trap
doors open as one person disap
pears and another appears in a
puff of smoke. And all in a
twinkling of the viewer's eye.
The lighting pace of the action
leaves the viewers no time for
anything but total involvement
in the play. In fact, 1 felt that the
continuity was chopped up by

the two intermissions.
Stanley Kauffmann, film critic
for New Republic magazine, was
bothered by Knock Knock's lack
of thematic unity.
"There isn't any genuine
point; there is just a series of ad
hoc points, of excuses. There
aren't even the true high spirits
to make it a consistently enter
taining improvisation."
1 disagree. The cartoonist in
Feiffer allows for the constant

change in place and action, as it
moving from one frame to the
next.
Cohn and Abe, like (lain and
Abel, are the sons of man sean h
ing eternally for their Eden.
They finally venture back into
the real world, though now with
something tobelieve in. And the
viewer, after a gleeful evening,
ventures out into the real world,
even more a believer in miracles.

The stakes are high in Jules Feiffer's Knock
Knock as Abe (Sydney Walker, left) gambles
with Helmut Wiesman (Tony Teague) over
whether Joan of Arc (Elizabeth Huddle, center)
