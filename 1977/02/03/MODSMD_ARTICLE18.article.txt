# Manzanita musical a hit
## Applause...plenty of it 
### Laura Kennedy 
What is it that they're living for?
That sweet applause!
The Manzanita Park Players should get plenty
of "that sound that says love" when they open
Applause tonight at 8 in Toyon Lounge.
Little gems of acting are sprinkled among the
truckload of costumes in this Broadway hit about
a scheming starlet, Eve Harrington, and her rise to
the top — and the effect she has on Margo Chan
ning, the older actress she imitates.
Elizabeth Campbell is a proper blend of imperi
ousness and fragility as Margo, and comes oft
convincingly as a fortyish woman worrying about
her fading youth. She sounds like a young Ethel
Merman in "But Alive," but with her deep voice,
she needs more volume.
Likewise, Cathy Gawne as Eve is too breathy in
both singing and acting. And her transformation
from a refugee of Macy's bargain basement to an
ambitious bitch-goddess is too sudden.
However, Gawne's somewhat artificial acting is
balanced by the superb portrayal of Margo's lover,
Bill, by Doug Bedard. It's a joy to see Bedard on
stage—even his shoulders act. And not just Margo
will fall in love with his mellow voice on "Think
How it's Gonna Be."
Another good actor is Rob Robinson as Duane,

Margo's fey hairdresser. Somehow he can get in
an extra wiggle just answering the phone.
Robinson is totally impish with dancer Dorrie
Braun in two of the show's big numbers,
"Applause" and "She's No Longer A Gypsy."
Braun shows strong acting as the leader of the
stagedoor gypsies. Her voice cuts through with
that bittersweet tone understood by anyone who's
been on stage — or wanted to be when she sings,
"What is it that we're living for?"
The chorus has plenty of bounce (one hopes
they won't kill themselves in the human pyramid
at the end of "Applause") but their numbers are
marred by mechanical choreographing by Clark
Sterlingand SusieCashion. Likewise,blockingby
director Robert Wildman is occasionally weari
some and strung out.
However, watching the costume changes in this
show is anything but wearisome. Margo shows up
in three gorgeous long gowns and an uncounted
number of dressing gowns, in addition to various
short dresses. Kudos must go to costume desig
ners Sandra Jones and Ellen Chambers for the
imagination they used in clothing a cast of over 30
— especially the "Virgin Mary's" costume which
shows quite a bit of virginal skin.
Anthony McDonald's combo (with a harp!) is a
refreshing change from the traditionally flat and
under-rehearsed musicians in most dorm shows.
