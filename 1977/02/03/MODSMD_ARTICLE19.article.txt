### Marc Strassman 
Emmylou Harris, who started
her performing career as a folk
singer in Greenwich Village in
the late 60s and who has lately
become a leading practitioner of
the country style, will bring her
substantial guitar-playing skills
and melifluous voice to Memo
rial Auditorium for two concerts
this Friday, at 7:30 and 10
p.m.
She will be accompanied by
the group the Hot Band. Lan
McDonald, whocalls himself lan
Matthews, will open the show.
Harris has produced three solo
albums, the latest of which, Lux
ury Liner, has been promoted
heavily lately, with a full-page
ad in Rolling Stone and frequent
radio plugs.
The album features songs from
a variety of genres, including a
rock and roll song from Chuck
Berry and a number of country
tunes, one of them co-written by
Harris.
While Harris' prominence is
relatively recent, her profes
sional experience goes back to
1967, when she was an aspiring
singer-songwriter on the East
Coast coffeehouse circuit.
Jubilee Records signed a con
tract with her in 1969, but in
1970, after delivering her first
album and her first child, she re
tired from active performing.
By 1971, she had returned to
performing as a folk-country
singer and, while playing in the
Cellar Door in Washington, D.C.,
was seen and heard by the Flying
Burrito Brothers. She played
with them for a while until the
band broke up.
At the Burritos' final concert,
Gram Parsons, a young country
rock singer, heard Harris and
was later introduced to her bv

Chris Hillman, a bassist with
several rock groups. Harris
worked with Parsons on his CP
album, on his spring 1973 tour,
and on his last album, Grievous
Angel. Parsons exerted consid
erable influence on Harris before
his early, mysterious death.
Harris * remained in
Washington, playing bluegrass
with her new Angelband, until
Warner Brothers signed her in
1974. She recorded Pieces of the
Sky (featuring her own "Boulder
to Birmingham") and Elite Hotel
(with the Beatles "Here, There
and Everywhere") for Warner
Bros., in 1975 and 1976, before
turning out Luxury Liner.
Lan Matthews, who will open
each of the two shows, is a vete
ran of three English groups:

Fairport Convention, Matthews
Southern Comfort, and Plain
song.
He has recorded songs written
by Joni Mitchell, Tim Hardin,
Neil Young and Jimmy Webb,
and Carol King.
His latest album, on Columbia
is called Go fur Broke and was
produced in Nashville. The
album includes Van Morrison's
"Brown-Eyed Girl." "Groovin."
by the Rascals, and The
Youngbloods' "Darkness,
Darkness" as well as some origi
nal songs.
The pleasant voices of the ar
tists, the laid-back mood of their
songs, and the relative intimacy
of tbe auditorium will make; thu
Harris-Hattbews concerts nota
ble.
