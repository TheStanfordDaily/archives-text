thorities also issued a military mobilization order affecting
East German men under 35.
There was no official comment from East Germany.
A spokesman for a West Berlin agency specializing in
East German affairs said: "We have learned that the Na
tional People's army has been put on increased alert and
that furloughs from some units were canceled."
The spokesman added, however, that the agency was
unaware of i»ny special orders for the call-up of additional
men in East Germany.
An allied military spokesman said "we are aware of the
mobilization reports but we have not confirmed them." He
said U.S., British and French garrisons in West Berlin had
not been put on special alert.

for a quick settlement in Rhodesia had "waned."

and tedious process."

putting regular forces on increased alert, communist au

East German men under 35.
There was no official comment from East Germany.

unaware of i»ny special orders for the call-up of additional
men in East Germany.
An allied military spokesman said "we are aware of the

not been put on special alert.
