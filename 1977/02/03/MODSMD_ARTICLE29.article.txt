In an effort to diversify the experi
ence of his captains, Public Safety Di
rector Marvin Herrington announced
that a massive reshuffling will occur in
his department on Monday.
Herrington said Investigations ("apt.

Walter Konar will be placed in charge
of police administration; Capt. Raoul
Nieineyer, presently responsible for
field enforcement, will be transfered to
investigations; and Capt. William
Wullschleger, now in charge of ad
ministration will head the field en
forcement division.
Herrington said his goal was to ro
tate captains once a year in an effort to
bring new insight and enthusiasm to
the positions.
"My aim is for each captain to work
in each division, so each has know
ledge of each division," Herrington
said. "Any one captain should be able
to take my place."
Niemeyer has been involved with
field enforcement for his entire career
here. He was hired two years ago after
serving with the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office for 10 years.
"I'm looking forward" to the new
setup, Niemeyer said. "I agree totally.
The department should be able to
function even if something should
happen to any one of us."
Niemeyer said he hopes to bring an
increased emphasis on crime preven
tion to the investigations division.
"I consider this a real challenge. I'd
like to see more crime prevention
programs. Most of our work is after the
fact. What we have to do is educate the
people to prevent crime; that is the
only solution," he said.
Konar was assigned to investiga
tions immediately after he was hired
by the University in April 1974. He
began his career in law enforcement
with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office in 1969 and has spent the last
six years in investigative functions.
According to Konar, "It'll be purely
an administrative position . . . there
are procedures that I'll have to brush
up on. . . . My whole tenure has been

in the field of investigations."
According to Ilerrington, konar re
cently completed an intensive bomb
disposal program presented under the
auspices of the U.S. Treasury Depart
ment. He and two other officers await
ing to undergo this training will form .1
bomb disposal unit.
Wullschleger has been in administ
ration since 196H when he was the
only captain on the force. He is a 15-
year veteran of the Department of Pub
lic Safety here. He was previously
employed by the Menlo Park police for
eight years.

only solution," he said.

by the University in April 1974. He
began his career in law enforcement

Office in 1969 and has spent the last

up on. . . . My whole tenure has been

in the field of investigations."

ration since 196H when he was the
only captain on the force. He is a 15-
year veteran of the Department of Pub

Walter Konar will be placed in charge
of police administration; Capt. Raoul
Nieineyer, presently responsible for
field enforcement, will be transfered to
investigations; and Capt. William
Wullschleger, now in charge of ad
ministration will head the field en
forcement division.
Herrington said his goal was to ro
tate captains once a year in an effort to
bring new insight and enthusiasm to
the positions.
"My aim is for each captain to work
in each division, so each has know
ledge of each division," Herrington
said. "Any one captain should be able
to take my place."
Niemeyer has been involved with
field enforcement for his entire career
here. He was hired two years ago after
serving with the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office for 10 years.
"I'm looking forward" to the new
setup, Niemeyer said. "I agree totally.
The department should be able to
function even if something should
happen to any one of us."
Niemeyer said he hopes to bring an
increased emphasis on crime preven
tion to the investigations division.
"I consider this a real challenge. I'd
like to see more crime prevention
programs. Most of our work is after the
fact. What we have to do is educate the
people to prevent crime; that is the
only solution," he said.
