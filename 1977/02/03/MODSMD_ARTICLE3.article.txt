# Carter calls for public sacrifices to alleviate U.S. energy crisis

Washington (AP) — President
jimmy Carter told Americans last
night it will take sacrifice, thrift and
cooperation to weather a permanent
energy shortage that government can
not solve "if you are not willing to
help."
The president's speech followed by
hours Congress' passage of his first
legislative proposal, granting him
emergency powers to divert natural
gas to states where supplies have been
depleted by an unusually bitter winter.
In a fireside chat on a cold winter
night, Carter asked the nation to rekin
dle a spirit of unity like that of World
War II days to cope with energy,
economic and an array of other prob
lems confronting his two-week-old

administration.
"I believe we are ready for that same
spirit again — to plan ahead, work to
gether and use common sense," he
said.
"Not because of war, but because we
realize that we must act together to
solve our problems and because we are
ready to trust one another."
Energy
Carter spoke first of energy, saying
that a permanent policy to deal with
that problem is one of his most urgent
projects. He praised Congress for its
quick passage of the emergency
natural gap act.
"But the real problem — our failure
to plan for the future or to take energy
conservation seriously — started long
before this winter and will take much
longer to solve," he said.
"This winter has made us all realize
that we have to act," he said.
Carter said he will complete by April
20 a long-term energy program em
phasizing conservation. He said the
nation now wastes more energy than it
imports.
"We must face the fact that the
energy shortage is permanent," he
said. "There is no way we can solve it
quickly.
Cooperation
"But if we all cooperate and make
modest sacrifices, if we learn to live
thriftily and remember the importance
of helping our neighbors, then we can
find ways to adjust and to make our
society more efficient and our lives
more productive."
Although he said "the energy shor
tage is permanent" and cannot be sol
ved quickly, he argued that the prob
lem can be dealt with more effectively
if Congress agrees to consolidate more
than 50 different agencies that now
have a hand in energy policy into a
single energy department "to bring
order out of this chaos."
As for his broader energy plan, he
said it will emphasize conservation,
the development of coal reserves, in
creased research on solar energy and
the maintenance of "strict safeguards
on necessary atomic energy produc
tion."
Thermostats
Seeming to suggest that his call for
lowered thermostats in wintertime be
come a permanent part of American
life, he said:
"All of us must learn to waste less
energy. Simply by keeping our ther
mostats at 65 degrees during the day
time and 55 degrees at night, we could
save half the current shortage of

natural gas."
Carter also placed considerable em
phasis on his proposals now before
Congress to jack up the economy with
a $31 -bi]lion, two-year program of tax
law changes and jobs programs.
"I realize that very few people will
think that this total economic plan is
perfect," he said. "Many groups would
like to see more of one kind of aid and
less of another.
"But I am confident that this is the
best type of balance plan we can pro
duce for the over-all economic health
of the nation.
"It will produce steady, balanced,
sustainable growth. It does not ignore
inflation to solve unemployment or
visa versa.
