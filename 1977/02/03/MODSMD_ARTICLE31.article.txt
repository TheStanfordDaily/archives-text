I. INTRODUCTION
Are tenure and promotion decisions made in such a way
as to enhance the quality of education at Stanford? Both of
the final slates in last spring's ASSU Council of Presidents
election found that these questions arose more often than
any others in their discussions with Stanford students.
Several recent developments have contributed to student
concern with this issue. One is rising tuition, which for
California residents is currently six times higher at Stanford
than at nearby UC-Santa Cruz. Stanford students are often
asked by younger friends still in high school and by their
parents, "Is Stanford worth the difference?"
Stanford admissions officers, in their visits with high
school students around the country, are frequently asked
similar questions about the quality of our educational pro
gram. It is the opinion of Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Fred Hargadon that "a reputation for excellence in teaching
is what attracts first-rate students to the University, and
perceived lack of excellence will lead them away from this
University."
Students and faculty are in general agreement that the
quality of undergraduate education at Stanford is good. The
high quality of our applicant pool and our success in
enrolling a large fraction of the students we admit underscore
the widespread reputation of the University for academic
excellence.

However, there have been indications in recent years that
there is room for improvement in the quality of undergradu
ate instruction. A recent survey of student attitudes found
that the percentage of students who were "very well satis
fied" with their educational experience at Stanford dropped
from 38% in 1961 to 24% in 1976-a trend which the
investigators found to be statistically significant. During this
same interval the percentage "not very well satisfied rose
from 7 to 13%. (Report by Sally Cole in Campus Report, V.
IX, n. 7, 1976).
Moreover, the University Ombudsman states in his most
recent report that student dissatisfaction wit+i courses and
instruction has greatly increased in recent years. (Report by
John Goheen in Campus Report, V. IX, no. 3, 1976). In
1975 this was a major reason for complaints presented to his
office.
Faculty and administrators are sensitive to these concerns
and have focused increasing energy and attention recently on
ways of improving the overall quality of the undergraduate
teaching program. Their concern has already produced some
useful results. These include:
* Creation of the new Teaching Resources Center to
assist faculty members wishing to improve their teaching,
initiated with the aid of a Danforth Foundation Grant and
substantial support from the Provost's Office;
* A series of teaching workshops for graduate student
teaching assistants organized by the Center;
* A program of faculty awards for excellence in teaching
introduced in the School of Humanities and Sciences last
year by Dean Halsey Royden;
* A comprehensive review of the undergraduate advising
program now being undertaken by the Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies, Herant Katchadourian;
* A comprehensive program of teaching evaluation in the
School of Engineering; and
* A deep concern with the quality of undergraduate
education as reflected in recent debate in the Academic
Senate.
In addition, we find an increasing demand at the level of
the Provost's Office and the Advisory Board for explicit
documentation of the teaching quality of the candidates
whom departments and schools propose for promotion.
Student interest in the relationship between tenure and
good teaching has been stimulated in the last two or three
years by the denial of tenure promotions to several professors
whom a number of students felt were outstanding teachers.
Students have frequently protested these decisions after
they have already been made. The predictable outcome has
been that tenure decisions have not been reversed. The net
result has been a considerable waste of energy on the part of
both students and administrators.
The Task Force was established by the Council of Presi
dents with the aim of seeking more constructive ways for
Stanford students and faculty to wot k together toward
improving the quality of teaching and enhancing the actual
weight given to teaching in deliberations on tenure, promo
tions, and other rewards.
We began our deliberations in the belief that good
teaching should be a continuous concern of both students
and faculty, not merely one periodically expressed when a
particularly well-liked teacher fails to gain tenure.
The Task Force was comprised of four students, five
faculty members and one administrator. The strong represen
tation of faculty reflects the view of the ASSU officers that
most of the Stanford faculty share the concern of the
students about the quality of education.
The Task Force was charged by the Council of Presidents
with investigating the impact of the tenure system on the
quality of undergraduate education at Stanford. Early in our
deliberations we broadened this to a more general considera
tion of the impact on undergraduate education of the entire
structure of rewards for Stanford faculty, including promo
tions beyond tenure and salary increases.
Meeting nearly every week during the months of summer
and fall quarters, we addressed ourselves to the following
questions:
1. What are the stated policies of the schools of the
University concerning the relationship between the quality of
a professor's teaching and his promotion, tenure, and salary
advances?
2. What is the actual basis for promotion, tenure, and
salary increase as perceived by the faculty?
3. What aspects of teaching are students best able to
evaluate on the basis of their educational experience at
Stan ford?
4. Are student evaluations now being used effectively to
help improve the quality of teaching?
5. Can sensible institutional arrangements be devised to
make better use of student input for the purpose of evalua
ting and improving the quality of teaching?
In considering question (3), the Task Force was aware
that teaching has many dimensions ranging from classroom
performance to the development of a new major or curri
culum. Since some of these are scarcely visible to students,
they have little basis for evaluating them. However, most

aspects of teaching involve interaction between the professor
and the student, and here the educational experience of the
student provides a useful basis for evaluation.
The Task Force gathered information of three types:
1) All of the official policy statements concerning pro
motion and tenure of the schools of the University were
reviewed.
2) All of the available surveys of faculty perceptions of
the importance of research and teaching in determining
faculty rewards were analyzed (see section on Faculty Atti
tudes ).
3) The advice of Acting Provost Massy, deans, and other
faculty responsible for the quality of undergraduate teaching
were sought through interviews.
The information gathered in this way provided the basis
for our recommendations.
In focusing on these issues and sources of information,
there was much that the Task Force did not consider. For
example, we were aware that classroom teaching comprises
only a part of the total educational and cultural life experi
enced by Stanford students. Academic advising, personal and
career counseling, involvement in residential education and
oth'jr forms of University service are important elements of
the student's education to which faculty members contri
bute. While recognizing the importance of these activities, the
Task Force decided to focus its attention solely on teaching
because of its central role.
We were aware of a number of other concerns about the
tenure system at Stanford: the anticipated reduction in the
number of future tenure appointments for demographic
reasons; the charges of political and personal bias in individ
ual tenure and promotion decisions; and questions about the
structure of the tenure system and its very worth as an
institution.
Again we recognized the importance of these issues, but
decided to confine our sti'dy to the relationship of the
faculty reward structure to the quality of teaching.
We feel these issues either are, or have been, best left to
other more appropriate bodies.
Some recent reports which deal with such issues are those
of Task Force IV of the Budget Priorities Advisory Commis
sion (October 22, 1975 Campus Report); the Stanford
Chapter of the AAUP (June 2, 1976 Campus Report); and
the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford (February
25, 1974, Faculty Senate Document No. 1234). In addition,
we refer those with a deeper interest in teaching evaluation to
the recent reports of the Subcommittee on Evaluation of
Teaching of the Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement.
II.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
In this section we present a summary of our recommenda
tions. In subsequent sections the information which provided
the basis for our recommendations is presented, with a
statement of the reasoning which led us to formulate the
recommendations.
An important finding of the Task Force, and one which
guided much of our work, was that a serious discrepancy
exists between the stated policies of the schools of the
University concerning promotion and tenure and the actual
basis for promotion and tenure as perceived by the faculty.
The school policy statements all call for balance between
teaching and research. Most of the statements require that
teaching and research be evaluated symmetrically. In striking
contrast with this, most of the faculty believe that research is
weighted much more heavily than teaching in promotion and
tenure decisions.
The most recent survey conducted at Stanford revealed
that 89% of the faculty perceives research to be "very
influential" or "extremely influential" in tenure decisions,
whereas only 12% perceives teaching to be "very influential"
or "extremely influential." Earlier surveys found similar
ratios.
Moreover, the majority of the faculty has repeatedly
indicated a preference for an increase in the weight given to
teaching. Clearly, then, there exists a substantial discrepancy
between how the faculty think tenure and promotion deci
sions should be made and how they feel the decisions
actually are being made.
The problem does not appear to be inadequate policy
statements. These generally reflect the consensus view of the
faculty. Rather, the heart of the problem appears to lie with
the operating procedures used by the various committees
throughout the University which make tenure and promotion
decisions.
In reviewing a professor's research, these committees
consider a large amount of information organized in a
standard format (complete bibliography, assessment by peers
within and outside the University, summary statement of
importance of research by departmental colleagues, etc.). In
reviewing a professor's teaching, on the other hand, depart
mental committees often rely on information which is much
less complete, in some cases amounting to little more than
impressionistic and anecdotal material supplied by a few
students and colleagues.
