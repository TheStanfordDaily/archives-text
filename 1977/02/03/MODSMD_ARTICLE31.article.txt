I. INTRODUCTION
Are tenure and promotion decisions made in such a way
as to enhance the quality of education at Stanford? Both of
the final slates in last spring's ASSU Council of Presidents
election found that these questions arose more often than
any others in their discussions with Stanford students.
Several recent developments have contributed to student
concern with this issue. One is rising tuition, which for
California residents is currently six times higher at Stanford
than at nearby UC-Santa Cruz. Stanford students are often
asked by younger friends still in high school and by their
parents, "Is Stanford worth the difference?"
Stanford admissions officers, in their visits with high
school students around the country, are frequently asked
similar questions about the quality of our educational pro
gram. It is the opinion of Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Fred Hargadon that "a reputation for excellence in teaching
is what attracts first-rate students to the University, and
perceived lack of excellence will lead them away from this
University."
Students and faculty are in general agreement that the
quality of undergraduate education at Stanford is good. The
high quality of our applicant pool and our success in
enrolling a large fraction of the students we admit underscore
the widespread reputation of the University for academic
excellence.

However, there have been indications in recent years that
there is room for improvement in the quality of undergradu
ate instruction. A recent survey of student attitudes found
that the percentage of students who were "very well satis
fied" with their educational experience at Stanford dropped
from 38% in 1961 to 24% in 1976-a trend which the
investigators found to be statistically significant. During this
same interval the percentage "not very well satisfied rose
from 7 to 13%. (Report by Sally Cole in Campus Report, V.
IX, n. 7, 1976).
Moreover, the University Ombudsman states in his most
recent report that student dissatisfaction wit+i courses and
instruction has greatly increased in recent years. (Report by
John Goheen in Campus Report, V. IX, no. 3, 1976). In
1975 this was a major reason for complaints presented to his
office.
Faculty and administrators are sensitive to these concerns
and have focused increasing energy and attention recently on
ways of improving the overall quality of the undergraduate
teaching program. Their concern has already produced some
useful results. These include:
* Creation of the new Teaching Resources Center to
assist faculty members wishing to improve their teaching,
initiated with the aid of a Danforth Foundation Grant and
substantial support from the Provost's Office;
* A series of teaching workshops for graduate student
teaching assistants organized by the Center;
* A program of faculty awards for excellence in teaching
introduced in the School of Humanities and Sciences last
year by Dean Halsey Royden;
* A comprehensive review of the undergraduate advising
program now being undertaken by the Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies, Herant Katchadourian;
* A comprehensive program of teaching evaluation in the
School of Engineering; and
* A deep concern with the quality of undergraduate
education as reflected in recent debate in the Academic
Senate.
In addition, we find an increasing demand at the level of
the Provost's Office and the Advisory Board for explicit
documentation of the teaching quality of the candidates
whom departments and schools propose for promotion.
Student interest in the relationship between tenure and
good teaching has been stimulated in the last two or three
years by the denial of tenure promotions to several professors
whom a number of students felt were outstanding teachers.
Students have frequently protested these decisions after
they have already been made. The predictable outcome has
been that tenure decisions have not been reversed. The net
result has been a considerable waste of energy on the part of
both students and administrators.
The Task Force was established by the Council of Presi
dents with the aim of seeking more constructive ways for
Stanford students and faculty to wot k together toward
improving the quality of teaching and enhancing the actual
weight given to teaching in deliberations on tenure, promo
tions, and other rewards.
We began our deliberations in the belief that good
teaching should be a continuous concern of both students
and faculty, not merely one periodically expressed when a
particularly well-liked teacher fails to gain tenure.
The Task Force was comprised of four students, five
faculty members and one administrator. The strong represen
tation of faculty reflects the view of the ASSU officers that
most of the Stanford faculty share the concern of the
students about the quality of education.
The Task Force was charged by the Council of Presidents
with investigating the impact of the tenure system on the
quality of undergraduate education at Stanford. Early in our
deliberations we broadened this to a more general considera
tion of the impact on undergraduate education of the entire
structure of rewards for Stanford faculty, including promo
tions beyond tenure and salary increases.
Meeting nearly every week during the months of summer
and fall quarters, we addressed ourselves to the following
questions:
1. What are the stated policies of the schools of the
University concerning the relationship between the quality of
a professor's teaching and his promotion, tenure, and salary
advances?
2. What is the actual basis for promotion, tenure, and
salary increase as perceived by the faculty?
3. What aspects of teaching are students best able to
evaluate on the basis of their educational experience at
Stan ford?
4. Are student evaluations now being used effectively to
help improve the quality of teaching?
5. Can sensible institutional arrangements be devised to
make better use of student input for the purpose of evalua
ting and improving the quality of teaching?
In considering question (3), the Task Force was aware
that teaching has many dimensions ranging from classroom
performance to the development of a new major or curri
culum. Since some of these are scarcely visible to students,
they have little basis for evaluating them. However, most

aspects of teaching involve interaction between the professor
and the student, and here the educational experience of the
student provides a useful basis for evaluation.
The Task Force gathered information of three types:
1) All of the official policy statements concerning pro
motion and tenure of the schools of the University were
reviewed.
2) All of the available surveys of faculty perceptions of
the importance of research and teaching in determining
faculty rewards were analyzed (see section on Faculty Atti
tudes ).
3) The advice of Acting Provost Massy, deans, and other
faculty responsible for the quality of undergraduate teaching
were sought through interviews.
The information gathered in this way provided the basis
for our recommendations.
In focusing on these issues and sources of information,
there was much that the Task Force did not consider. For
example, we were aware that classroom teaching comprises
only a part of the total educational and cultural life experi
enced by Stanford students. Academic advising, personal and
career counseling, involvement in residential education and
oth'jr forms of University service are important elements of
the student's education to which faculty members contri
bute. While recognizing the importance of these activities, the
Task Force decided to focus its attention solely on teaching
because of its central role.
We were aware of a number of other concerns about the
tenure system at Stanford: the anticipated reduction in the
number of future tenure appointments for demographic
reasons; the charges of political and personal bias in individ
ual tenure and promotion decisions; and questions about the
structure of the tenure system and its very worth as an
institution.
Again we recognized the importance of these issues, but
decided to confine our sti'dy to the relationship of the
faculty reward structure to the quality of teaching.
We feel these issues either are, or have been, best left to
other more appropriate bodies.
Some recent reports which deal with such issues are those
of Task Force IV of the Budget Priorities Advisory Commis
sion (October 22, 1975 Campus Report); the Stanford
Chapter of the AAUP (June 2, 1976 Campus Report); and
the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford (February
25, 1974, Faculty Senate Document No. 1234). In addition,
we refer those with a deeper interest in teaching evaluation to
the recent reports of the Subcommittee on Evaluation of
Teaching of the Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement.
II.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
In this section we present a summary of our recommenda
tions. In subsequent sections the information which provided
the basis for our recommendations is presented, with a
statement of the reasoning which led us to formulate the
recommendations.
An important finding of the Task Force, and one which
guided much of our work, was that a serious discrepancy
exists between the stated policies of the schools of the
University concerning promotion and tenure and the actual
basis for promotion and tenure as perceived by the faculty.
The school policy statements all call for balance between
teaching and research. Most of the statements require that
teaching and research be evaluated symmetrically. In striking
contrast with this, most of the faculty believe that research is
weighted much more heavily than teaching in promotion and
tenure decisions.
The most recent survey conducted at Stanford revealed
that 89% of the faculty perceives research to be "very
influential" or "extremely influential" in tenure decisions,
whereas only 12% perceives teaching to be "very influential"
or "extremely influential." Earlier surveys found similar
ratios.
Moreover, the majority of the faculty has repeatedly
indicated a preference for an increase in the weight given to
teaching. Clearly, then, there exists a substantial discrepancy
between how the faculty think tenure and promotion deci
sions should be made and how they feel the decisions
actually are being made.
The problem does not appear to be inadequate policy
statements. These generally reflect the consensus view of the
faculty. Rather, the heart of the problem appears to lie with
the operating procedures used by the various committees
throughout the University which make tenure and promotion
decisions.
In reviewing a professor's research, these committees
consider a large amount of information organized in a
standard format (complete bibliography, assessment by peers
within and outside the University, summary statement of
importance of research by departmental colleagues, etc.). In
reviewing a professor's teaching, on the other hand, depart
mental committees often rely on information which is much
less complete, in some cases amounting to little more than
impressionistic and anecdotal material supplied by a few
students and colleagues.
The following recommendations are presented in the
spirit of finding ways to bring the weight given to teaching
into balance with research and to improve the teaching
quality of all faculty members.
RECOMMENDATION I
Adoption of a University policy that every course be
evaluated by students each time it is offered.
Discussion and Rationale:
1) The University presently lacks a mechanism for evalua
ting teaching on a systematic, comparative basis.
2) Student evaluations would provide a basis for assessing
those aspects of teaching involving interaction between the
professor and the student.
3) Together with material supplied by departmental col
leagues, the student evaluations would provide the basis for
evaluating teaching in tenure and promotion decisions.
Summaries of student evaluations of courses should be
available to students.
Discussion and rationale:
1) Since Stanford tuition consumes a substantial part of
the discretionary income of the families of many Stanford
students, we feel that the student deserves a "consumer's
report" to help guide his choices.
2) Universal course evaluations will provide a more com
plete guide than the present ASSU Course Guide and a
valuable supplement to the information in the Course Ab
stracts.
3) Copies of student evaluations should be made available
in designated places around the University.
RECOMMENDATION II
Retrospective surveys conducted among seniors and re
cent alumni are needed to assess the long-term value of
courses and of advising.
Discussion and rationale:
1) Many faculty are concerned that favorable student
evaluations may reflect the popularity of the subject covered
by a course and the showmanship of the lecturer but not the
lasting value of the course to the student. After a few years
have passed, the mature student might rank the courses he
has taken quite differently in terms of their importance to his
intellectual development than the way he rated them as he
was taking them. We propose giving greater depth to student
evaluation of courses by asking students to evaluate the
long-term importance of courses they took from three to five
years ago.
2) As part of the documentation concerning teaching
supplied for promotion and tenure evaluations, a survey
would routinely be conducted among a representative sample
of students who had taken the professor's courses.
3) A similar survey would be conducted among a sample
of a professor's advisees to assess retrospectively the quality
of the academic advising they received.
RECOMMENDATION 111
A new committee of the Academic Senate is needed for
the comparative assessment of teaching in the Schools of
Humanities and Sciences, Earth Sciences, and Engineering.
Discussion and rationale:
1) The committee would be composed of faculty, stu
dents and a member of the Provost's staff, with faculty
members comprising a majority.
2) The committee would be charged with making univer
sity-wide comparisons of teaching quality as assessed by
students for all courses of similar format.
3) These comparative assessments would enable a more
symmetrical consideration of teaching and research as criteria
for faculty promotions and rewards.
4) The committee would also be charged with designing a
course questionnaire suitable for the wide range of courses
taught at Stanford.
5) Such a committee is also needed to implement and
monitor the universal course evaluation process.
RECOMMENDATION IV
Financial awards for excellent teaching should be made
by the committee.
Discussion and rationale:
1) These awards would be modeled on those inaugurated
by Dean Halsley Royden in the School of Humanities and
Sciences and would consist of increases of $1,000 in the pay
scale of faculty members over and above normal increases.
2) Although tenure decisions are the part of the Univer
sity reward structure which receive the greatest public atten
tion, most teaching is done by professors who have already
received tenure. Salaries constitute an important part of the
University's reward structure for these professors.
3) Each faculty member would be reviewed by the
committee once every seven years. The review wrvjld consist
of considering summaries of individual course reviews for the
past seven years, conducting a retrospective survey among

r ■> o•! ♦ •- *» ■> . .
former students of the professor and evaluating this survey.
In addition, the committee would consider whatever informa
tion the departments supplied about the professor's contribu
tion to curriculum development and other aspects of good
teaching not visible to the student.
4) We propose that each year about one-quarter of the
eligible faculty receive an award. (Since reviews would occur
every seven years, this would be slightly less than 4% of the
total faculty every year.)
RECOMMENDATION V
All search committees should be expected to gather as
detailed an appraisal as possible of the teaching quality of the
candidates they are considering for a faculty appointment.
Discussion and rationale:
1) Search committees should seek quantitative student
evaluation data wherever possible, and student letters of
evaluation when more systematic and comprehensive infor
mation is unavailable.
2) Efforts to obtain such information, handled with
discretion and common sense, can begin to institute for new
appointments the type of symmetrical procedures for the
evaluation of teaching and research that we are recommend
ing for tenure and promotion decisions.
111. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
APPOINTMENTS AND PROMOTIONS
University policy, as stated in the Faculty Handbook,
requires that any recommendation for promotion to tenure
be supported by "evidence that the candidate is among the
two or three of the very best persons at a similar level of
professional development, and that the individual has made
significant scholarly contributions."
Within this broad framework, each school in the Univer
sity has developed its own articulation of the criteria for
promotion, especially promotion to tenured ranks. Each of
these policy statements sets the appropriate balance for the
school between what they all regard as the two chief criteria
for appointments and promotions: research and teaching.
The School of Humanities and Sciences requires that "any
individual who is to be recommended for appointment or
promotion to tenure must be truly superior as either a
teacher or scholar and at least very good at the other. He or
she should be demonstrably the best person available." This
has in practice come to mean, according to Dean Halsey
Royden, "that the individual has given firm evidence of being
one of the leading scholars or teachers in his or her field in
the nation."
The School of Engineering recognizes team leadership in
research and teaching as important, along with research and
teaching per se, but notes that "in the University environ
ment research and teaching are the more important qualities,
and leadership alone is not sufficient to replace either of
these."
The aim of the school is "eminence in the first rank of
American Universities," and it is expected that any faculty
member promoted to tenure will continue to do work that
increases the visibility of the School, as well as his or her own
personal visibility. Beyond this, the statement does not make
clear how much of this contribution may come from research
and how much from teaching, although it recognizes that the
professor may choose to emphasize one of the two activities
somewhat more than the other.
The School of Earth Sciences policy is similar in recog
nizing research, teaching, and administrative work as all
contributing to the functioning and eminences of the School
and the University.
These three activities, plus outside professional service,
form the basis for evaluation, and are weighed in the
following fashion: "Weakness in one may be partially com
pensated by strength in the others. No amount of teaching,
committee work, or outside activities, however, can be
regarded as entirely taking the place of productive research."
In addition to these schools which do undergraduate
teaching, the Task Force examined the policy statements of
three of Stanford's graduate schools: Business, Law, and
Education. These statements are similar to that of the School
of Humanities and Sciences in establishing a relatively even
balance between the two chief criteria for promotion.
The Law School, for example, states that "tenure may be
granted when outstanding performance on one of the first
two criteria [research and teachingl outweighs lesser perfor
mance on the other." Thus a truly outstanding teacher "may
be awarded tenure though his or her scholarly production is
quantitatively (not qualitatively) less than is normally ex
pected."
Similarly, all candidates for appointment or promotion to
tenure in the Graduate School of Business must have dem
onstrated performance in teaching or research which is
"clearly outstanding," plus an "acceptable level of perfor
mance" in the other. To be judged clearly outstanding, the
candidate must "be compared with the best researchers
nationally for the position in question or with the best
teachers at Stanford or nationally insofar as evidence is
available." The School states explicitly that excellence in at

least one of the two areas is necessary—simply being very
good, even at both, is not sufficient.
The School of Education lists teaching, research and
institutional service as the categories of performance on
which promotion decisions will be based, but notes the
substantial difficulty in setting any general policy on the
relative weights they are to be accorded. Rather, the School
requires "demonstrated, strong achievement and contribu
tion" in these three areas, "accepting different individual
profiles but rejecting mediocrity, weakness or disinterest in
any one aspect, no matter how strong in another."
We find in these six policy statements a fairly common
thread—the concept of symmetry between research and
teaching as criteria for tenure. That is, the candidate for
appointment or promotion is expected to meet some stand
ard of unquestioned excellence on the one, and a lesser but
still demanding standard of performance on the other, with
no specification that an emphasis on teaching is inherently to
be preferred to one on research, or vice versa.
In this sense, research and teaching are defined as of
roughly equal weight in most of these schools. However, in
Earth Sciences, and to a lesser extent in Engineering, research
cannot be compensated by other areas of performance to the
same extent that teaching can, and therefore in these two
schools the two criteria are not quite symmetrically defined.
In addition, it should be noted that other interpretations
of University standards for tenure have been offered which
differ more sharply from the policy statements of these
schools. The reports of the Committee on the Professoriate at
Stanford argues, "The criteria for appointment to the ten
ured-line faculty have been, and should be, excellence in
scholarship (research) and an active commitment to the
University's goal of combining scholarship with teaching."
The definitions of teaching and research are also quite
common across these various schools. Teaching is conceived
of as a broad range of interactions with students, both
graduate and undergraduate, both inside and outside the
classroom.
This includes lecturing, guiding small seminars, laboratory
and project teaching and the supervision of graduate student
research. It is also widely seen as involving course preparation
and design, including aspects such as "organizing course
structure, preparing laboratory materials, [and] experiment
ing with new instructional techniques," in the words of the
Earth Sciences statement.
Research is universally seen as research and scholarship
activity which extends and deepens existing knowledge and
which, in the words of the Business School, "ordinarily
results in publications of high quality."
This includes not only the activities which generate new
knowledge, such as the preparing and testing of new hypo
theses, the development of new methods and technology, the
discovery and interpretation of old ones, but the summari
zing and synthesizing of current knowledge in books, text
books and review articles.
The evaluation of these two activities is quite different.
Research and scholarship are everywhere evaluated by publi
cations. The importance of publication is clearly articulated
by the Engineering School:
"Originality and productivity in research are universally
acknowledged as important qualities. The traditional measure
is peer recognition coming from evaluation of publications in
refereed journals. . . .
"Further recognition through honors and prizes or refer
ence in subsequent papers adds to the measure of importance
of a contribution. The number of important papers authored
is a measure of research productivity of a faculty member."
This evaluation by peers, at Stanford and around the
nation, of published work is a standard procedure relied on in
all schools to evaluate a candidate's research and scholarship
work.
By contrast, methods for evaluation of teaching vary
widely from school to school and, within Humanities and
Sciences, from department to department. The 1975 report
of the Subcommittee on Evaluation of Teaching states that
all departments in the School of Humanities and Sciences use
a formal procedure for evaluating teaching, sometimes in
cluding student evaluation, in consideration of a candidate
for long-term reappointment and promotion.
Frequency of student course evaluation differs from one
department to the next; six of the 21 departments which
responded to the subcommittee's questionnaire report that
all courses are evaluated by students each time they are given.
At least seven departments had no set policy regarding
student course evaluation.
In April of 1976, Dean Royden requested from each
department a plan for the improvement and evaluation of
teaching, although the role of student evaluations remains up
to the discretion of the departments.
In the School of Engineering, the student honor society,
Tau Beta Pi, administers student evaluation of all courses. (As
this is written, one department is not participating in the Tau
Beta Pi program of course evaluation.) In evaluating teaching,
the School recognizes that "student evaluation is relevant, as
well as the opinion of faculty colleagues, and the subsequent
performance of students taught." It is now standard proce
dure in the School that no professor can be promoted unless
he or she has submitted some kind of teaching evaluation

evidence.
The course evaluations conducted by Tau Beta Pi are seen
as a useful guide in improving teaching and as "an objective
measure of comparison between the teaching qualities of
different people."
These student surveys are in two parts: the first is a
number of standardized questions for which mean scores can
be computed; the second is three open-ended questions
designed to elicit comments from students. The data from
the standardized questions is now sent to the professor and
released only with his or her consent. From the student
comments on the second half of the survey, Tau Beta Pi
selects a representative sample which is published in a
booklet and made available to students at various places in
the School.
In the School of Earth Sciences, about one-half of the
faculty are estimated to use some sort of student evaluation
forms. Instructors in large lecture courses prepare their own
evaluation forms. In addition, Earth Sciences faculty mem
bers are evaluated by their pees, who frequently visit each
other's classes.
The Graduate School of Business has the most rigorous
program of student course evaluation. Every course is evalu
ated by students every quarter. Statistics are tabulated by the
dean's office, which returns the final tabulation and the
forms to the professor. The office retains a copy of the
computer print-out and gives a copy of the data on second
year elective courses (all first-year courses are mandatory) to
the presidents of the student organizations (i.e., "the MBA
Association) for distribution to the general student body.
Comments are read only by the professor.
New teachers may request that no data on their first year
of teaching be recorded in the dean's office, although they
are required to conduct the evaluation in class.
These then are the stated criteria for appointments and
promotions and the procedures for assessing performance on
them in various schools. The actual balance between these
primary criteria of research and teaching is examined in the
next section of faculty attitudes.
We might note here, however, that there appears to be
some relationship between the degree to which teaching is
systematically evaluated by students and the balance between
the teaching and research criteria.
In the Graduate School of Business, which has the most
thorough program of student evaluation. Associate Dean
Jaedicke claims that while research is somewhat more em
phasized in practice, the school strives for a balance between
the two, and probably achieves a ratio in the neighborhood
of 60/40.
By contrast, in the School of Humanities and Sciences,
which has the least comprehensive program of student evalua
tion, a member of the Provost's staff has estimated that only
one or two of the ten or eleven promotions to tenure each
year have been made on the basis of teaching as tht area of
greatest achievement.
IV FACULTY ATTITUDES TOWARD THE
REWARD STRUCTURE
In the last 20 years, Stanford professors have been
surveyed four times on their attitudes toward the University's
system of faculty incentives and rewards. All of these surveys
have found, with a striking degree of uniformity, that faculty
members perceive research as counting substantially more
than teaching in the allocation of rewards in the University,
and that faculty would prefer a more even balance between
these two criteria. In addition, one of these studies has
uncovered a strong association between the weights faculty
perceive teaching and research to carry in decisions about
rewards and the amount of time they allocate to each of
these activities.
During the 1954-55 academic year, as part of the Study
of Undergraduate Education chaired by President J.E.
Wallace Sterling, all members of the faculty were sent a
questionnaire which listed seven views on the relative weight
given to teaching and research in appointments, promotions,
and salary increases.
Respondents were asked to select the statement which
seemed to represent most accurately the policy followed in
their departments and the statement they judged most
appropriate for Stanford. The scale of statements was order
ed from (1) research being the primary criterion to (7)
teaching being the primary criterion.
Faculties of the professional schools perceived their de
partment's policies to fall somewhere between (4) attaching
eoual importance to teaching and research and (3) careful
attention to both, with research receiving somewhat greater
emphasis.
The faculty of Humanities and Sciences, on the other
hand, perceived research as counting considerably more than
teaching, with the modal response in this school being (2)
teaching receives some attention in decisions about advance
ment, but quantity and quality of research are the major
considerations. A somewhat smaller number of Humanities
and Sciences faculty perceived (3) to be the policy prevailing
in their department. These responses varied widely by depart
ment, however, with some departments perceived as placing
roughly equal weight on the two criteria, and others appear
ing to place nearly exclusive emphasis on research.
When asked to state their own preference for the policy

"most appropriate for Stanford," the most frequent reply by
members of the H & S faculty was that equal weight should
be placed upon the two activities. The evidence indicated
unmistakably that the faculty desired greater emphasis in the
rewards structure upon the quality of teaching.
A similar pattern was found in a 1968 study conducted
by the late Robert Hind, a former University administrative
officer who was, at the time, a Ph.D. candidate in the
Department of Sociology.
Hind surveyed 100 faculty members in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, asking them to rate separately for
research and teaching the actual influence each carried in the
determination of University rewards and the amount of
influence they preferred that each be given.
Research was perceived to be extremely influential (on a
scale ranging from "not at all" to "extremely" influential) by
a majority of the faculty sample. At the same time, a large
majority rated teaching moderately or only slightly influen
tial, with "slightly" influential being the modal .response
(Table 1). In terms of preferences, a majority of the faculty
sample wanted both teaching and research to count at least
very heavily, though more favored an "extremely" influential
role for research than was the case with teaching. (Table 2).

Thc-se perceptions and preferences were not much
affected by the age, rank or salary level of the professor,
though older and higher-salaried professors tended somewhat
more frequently to prefer a high level of influence for
teaching.
One characteristic of the faculty, however, which drama
tically divided them as to their perceptions and preferences
was their disciplinary area. Within the School of Humanities
and Sciences, it was the Humanities in particular where a
highly influential role for teaching was preferred (by 77% of
those interviewed) and where an appreciable number (one
third) perceived teaching as already having a strong impact on
rewards. In the Natural and Social Sciences, only about
one-quarter wanted a very influential role for teaching, and
fewer than one out of ten perceived this to be the reality.

Combining the responses to the perception and preference
questions. Hind computed the desired change in the emphasis
given these two criteria. Large majorities of those perceiving
moderate influence or less for teaching wanted an increased
emphasis on this activity in the distribution of rewards in the
University. Almost no one in the sample wished to see
teaching count less than it already did. Among those per
ceiving research as moderately influential, only about one
third desired an increase in the weight accorded it.
More striking perhaps were the substantial percentages
among the majority of faculty perceiving research to be very
or extremely important who favored a decrease in the weight
given to research. Of those perceiving research as extremely
influential, 45% wanted it to be less so, while 39% of those
seeing research as very influential wanted it deemphasized.

In sum, most of those who felt teaching counted little
wanted it to count more; a large proportion of those who felt
research carried heavy influence wanted it to carry less.
Overall, a large majority of the faculty interviewed wanted
more weight assigned to teaching; few wanted less. A third of
the faculty wanted less weight assigned to research; few
wanted more.
Hind's data on the allocation of faculty time is, we
believe, of particular importance. While faculty in H & S were
found to spend more time on graduate and undergraduate
teaching than on research (Table 5), the amount of time
spent on classroom teaching was very clearly associated with
the perception of the weight given to teaching in decisions
about tenure, promotions and other rewards. Those who
perceived teaching as being at least moderately influential in
determining rewards tended in far greater numbers than those
who perceived it of little influence to spend a "high"
proportion of their time teaching graduates and undergradu
ates in the classroom.
As Hind notes, this association is so strong as to be
expected by chance only five times in 100. Similarly with
research, those who perceived it as having great influence
spent a high proportion of their time on it. In contrast, those
who believed it to carry little weight in the determination of
rewards spent less time on it. (Tables 5 & 6)

One does not need a Ph.D. in sociology to arrive at the
conclusion Hind drew from his data: Individuals tend to
devote more time to tasks which are seen to be influential in
their evaluations and rewards. Specifically, those who believe
they will be rewarded for good teaching spend more time on
it than those who believe teaching counts little as a criterion
in the determination of rewards. And those who believe they
will be rewarded for research and scholarship spend more
time in these activities than those who believe they count for
little in the evaluation process.
The findings of the Hind survey and the earlier study of
undergraduate education are reinforced by a 1972 study of
the Stanford faculty conducted by Statistics Prof. Bredly
Efron.
On a scale on which research and publication are worth
10 points, professors were asked to rate the importance of
teaching in promotion and tenure decisions. Only 4% of
those surveyed perceived teaching as being equal in weight to
research. Almost two-thirds of those responding placed the
actual influence of teaching at a point on the scale (four or
less) representing not even half the weight given to research
and publication. (Table 7)

Once again, however, preferences were quite different
than perceptions of the present University policy. Almost
half of those responding preferred teaching to be roughly
equal to research; a few even felt teaching should count
somewhat more. Another quarter of the sample desired a
level of influence for teaching at least half that given
research. (Table 8).
In terms of preference for change, these figures translate
into an astounding 71% of the faculty who believed that
teaching was given weight than it should be given in
tenure and promotion decisions (Table 9).

The weight which faculty perceive to be accorded publica
tion in particular was measured by the question, "How
accurately does 'publish or perish' describe your present or
past situation at Stanford?" Two-thirds of the faculty sample
believed this to be an "accurate'' or "very accurate" descrip
tion. These figures were especially large for faculty who had
not yet attained tenure or had not yet attained the rank of
full professor. (Table 10)

Faculty comments in response to this question are partic
ularly revealing, and for these we refer the interested reader
to Efron's original report.
In the past academic year (1975-76), Sally Cole under
took to replicate a portion of Hind's survey (using a strati
fied, random sample of 50 faculty members) as part of a
faculty survey on the Honor Co'de.
As in the Hind study, professors sampled from the School
of Humanities and Sciences were asked to consider their
teaching, research, and University service, and to indicate
their perception of the contribution each makes to the
tangible rewards they receive from the University (e.g.,
salaries, promotions, clerical support, etc.).
Again, as in 1968, each faculty member was asked to
indicate the level of influence he or she would prefer to see
for each of these activities, and the difference—the desired
change—was computed for each activity.
Because Cole's questions were identical to those Hind
asked, we are provided with an excellent longitudinal study
of changes in faculty'perceptions and preferences over the
last eight years.
This longitudinal comparison shows that there has been
some change in perceptions. The percentage perceiving teach
ing to be very or extremely influential has decreased since
1968, from 20% to 12%. The total percentage, however, who
believes teaching makes at least a moderately influential
contribution to rewards has increased from 42% in 1968 to
54% today. (Table 11)

Research was believed to have a very or extremely

At the extremes of the scales, the data present a stark
contrast: Today only J2% of the H&S faculty believes that
teaching is very or extremely influential in contributing to
the tangible rewards they receive from the University, while
90% believe that research is very or extremely influential.
These changes in perception, however, have been matched
by changes in preference as well. Though the proportion
favoring very or extremely strong influence for teaching has
remained the same (about one-half), the percentage favoring
at least a moderate influence (or greater) has risen from 80%
in 1968 to 92% in 1976. (Table 13)

The result of these simultaneous increases in both percep
tions and preferences is that faculty desires for change in the
influence given to research and teaching mirror almost preci
sely the figures from eight years ago.
Although the faculty continues to favor a heavy emphasis
on research in the determination of their tangible rewards,
the preferred direction of change continues to favor more
influence for teaching. Fully 54% of the faculty favor
increasing the weight given to teaching, while only 8% would
reduce it. (Table 15)

These findings confirm the previous studies we have
examined and indicate that the faculty today, as in the past,
would welcome greater emphasis on teaching in determining
the tangible rewards they receive from the University.
As for University service, H&S faculty perceive it as
counting more today than it did eight years ago. More
perceive it as having a moderate influence on rewards, fewer
perceive it to have no influence at all, while "slight" in
fluence still remains the modal perception. (Table 17)

In terms of desired change, these figures show a somewhat
greater proportion favoring a decrease in the weight given to
University service than was the case in 1968, a somewhat
smaller proportion (but still clearly the modal response)
favoring no change, and exactly the same proportion as in
1968—about one-third—wanting University service to count
more heavily. Table 19)

The above responses of Stanford faculty may be placed in
some kind of comparative national perspective through an
examination of the findings of a nation-wide survey of
college and university professors conducted by Everett C.
Ladd Jr. and Seymour Martin Lipset in 1975.
The survey results are broken down into highest tier
schools—research and doctoral granting institutions, including
Stanford—and middle and lower tier schools (small colleges,
comprehensive universities and colleges, local colleges, etc.)
With respect to faculty preferences for the relative weight
given to research and teaching, the Ladd-Lipset data for
higher tier schools teno to reinforce the findings of the
previous surveys of Stanford faculty.
A substantial majority of the faculty surveyed (72%)
agreed that "faculty promotions should be based in part on
formal student evaluations of their teachers." (Table 20)

Surprisingly, the faculty members in these highest tier
schools rejected by only a slim majority (52%) the notion
that "teaching effectiveness, and not publications, should be
the primary criterion for promotion of faculty." (Table 22)

While faculty in these schools do not feel that teaching
snould be weighted more heavily than research and publica
tion, they do see negative implications for the quality of
undergraduate education in the present emphasis on research.
And they do endorse by a wide margin the idea that student
evaluations of teaching should play at least some role in
decisions on promotion.
The special mission of the research-oriented universities is
underscored by the clear difference in priority that faculty
from the highest tier schools attach to teaching as opposed to
faculty from the middle and lowest tiers.
The latter two groups overwhelmingly favor an emphasis
on teaching as the primary criterion for promotion. Highest
tier faculty by a narrow margin reject this focus on teaching
as a contradiction of the role of their institutions within the
larger scheme of American higher education. (Table 23)

Efron's study, as well, indicated a strong receptivity on
the part of faculty of all ranks to the notion of regular
student evaluation of teaching. Almost the entire sample
(97%) agreed that teaching should be evaluated regularly, and
of these, 96% agreed that student evaluation, either alone or
in concert with colleague evaluation, should be the method
used. (Table 24)

Surprisingly, almost none of the faculty favored colleague
nvnluation without student evaluation. It should also be
noted that half the faculty preferred student evaluation to
the complete exclusion of colleague evaluation, and that
most faculty had been evaluated by students, but had never
had thair teaching evaluated by their colleagues.
In his 1968 study, Hind asked faculty members to
iflnntify the significant evaluators of their teaching. Students
worn Identified as at least moderately influential by 37% of
the faculty, and were not named at all by 37%. (Table 25)

evaluation of their teaching. (Table 28)

Of those who did identify colleagues as one source of

professors preferred at least a moderately strong emphasis (or
greater). (Table 29)

In comparing these assessments of student and colleague
evaluation, it may be noted that professors preferred roughly
similar levels of influence for these two sources, and ex
pressed roughly similar levels of satisfaction with each source
(though the proportion professing to be extremely satisfied
was greater with student evaluations than with colleague
evaluations).
This suggests that H&S professors, at least in 1968, may
have preferred a more even balance between student and
colleague evaluation than Efron's 1972 data seems to indi
cate.
As for the question of student involvement in delibera
tions on appointments and promotions, the Ladd-Lipset
survey again provides some data which we suspect reflect in a
general way the preferences of Stanford faculty In the
national sample of highest tier schools, only about one-tenth
of the faculty hoped to see students as voting members on
faculty appointment and promotion committees. Rather,
some kind of consultative role in the process was preferred
for undergraduates by almost two-thirds of the faculty.

V THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESEARCH
AND TEACHING
We have found no evidence of inherent conflict between
good teaching and good research. There is conflicting evi
dence on the proposition that quality teaching and produc
tive research activity tond to be associated.
In his Ph.D. dissertation, Robert Hind notes two studies
of the relationship between research and teaching One study
of Tufts University faculty compared mean student evalua
tion ratings of teaching effectiveness and records of research
awards. Hind notes in general that "the mean ratings for
teacher effectiveness were highest for members of the faculty
who received government or foundation research support,
next highest for those receiving only a faculty award, and
lowest for those receiving no support for research*.'
(Robert R. Hind, "Evaluation and Authority in a Univer
sity Faculty," Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University School
of Education, 1968. See also Jack B. Bresler, "Teaching
Effectiveness and Government Awards," Science, Vol. 60,
April 12, 1968, pp 164-167.)
Hind also reports that a similar investigation at the
University of Washington found no relationship between
number of publications and teaching effectiveness, and no
relationship between memberships in the University's re
search society and teaching effectless, when faculty of the
same rank and department were compared.
(See Virginia W. Voeks, "Publication and Teaching Effec
tiveness," Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 33, No. 4, April
1962, pp 212-218).
One can make a hypothetical case either for or against the
proposition that high quality in teachng and research are
causally related.
On the one hand it can be argued that the superior
teacher has a commitment to students which necessarily leads
to a continual search for new findings which students must
be confronted with in the classroom. The superior researcher,
it is argued, carries into the classroom a sense of creativity, a
depth of knowledge and an excitement about the field that
can inspire students and make the material truly "come
alive" for them
The counter argument holds that e.- ' r rch is so time
consuming that it necessarily invades the >ne the faculty
member has available tor the careful preo 'ration of lectures,
for the thoughtful criticism of stude.it papers, and for
student counsel n ? Those who hold thi» point of view also
argue that the outstanding teacher will necessarily spend
substantial amounts of time keeping abreast of new know
ledge in the broad tield in which he or she teaches, even
though he or may not cieate new knowledge which
results in publication.
We are in no oosition to lay these conflicting arguments
to rest. Clearly, good teaching is done at "iany liberal arts
colleges in which research resulting ir uibl-cation is not
emphasized It is equally clear that faco"v "■ambers who are
active in reseorch may be better info and may infect
their students with a thirst for new kno ,0..
Our own working hypothesis is tha -e is no necessary
conflict between the two activities, that , research environ
ment may enhance the teaching funcrio", and that common
observation indicates that not every great lesearcher is effec
tive in communicating with students, |ust as not every great
teacher engages in a substantial amount of research which
results in publication.
Given the absence of a definitive body of research which
clearly establishes a causal relationship between excellence in
teaching and research, we continue to feel, as do the deans of
the several schools, that faculty promotions and other tan
gible rewards should be allocated only after an evaluation of
the faculty member's performance in both research and

teaching.
VI RECOMMENDATIONS
University Appointments and Promotions Policy
The evidence on faculty attitudes presented above clearly
shows that Stanford professors perceive research to be much
more heavily weighted than teaching in decisions about
t»>nure, promotions and salary advances. In shows, with
striking consistency over time, that the majority of the
faculty prefer that more weight be given to teaching.
The natural inclination in the face of such a substantial
and enduring disparity between preference and perceived
reality is to harmonize the policy with faculty values and
desires. But after examining the extensive survey data and the
stated appointments and promotions policies of the various
schools, the Task Force has concluded that the basic problem
is not one of policy but rather of implementation.
We find a common thread in the policy statements of
most schools which we strongly endorse: a concept of
symmetry between research and teaching.
While an approximate balance is encouraged in the time,
energy and talent devoted to research and teaching, most
schools have some kind of official language similar to that of
the Law School, recognizing for promotion the candidate
whose "oustanding performance on one of the two criteria
outweighs lesser performance on the other."
In these school policies, what is true of research is equally
true of teaching. A candidate may emphasize either teaching
or research somewhat more than the other. In the area of
special excellence, the candidate's performance must rank
among that of the very best people available to the Univer
sity. In the other area substantial competence must be
demonstrated.
We conclude that the heart of the problem is simply this:
While teaching and research are discussed symmetrically in
many policy statements, they are handled asymmetrically in
tenure and promotion hearings, with research in practice
being accorded more weight than teaching.
University, school and departmental guidelines describing
the tenure process are generally very specific about the
documents required for the evaluation by tenure and promo
tion committees. A list of all books and articles published by
the professor is always required to evaluate research. In
addition, letters must be obtained from specialists in the
professor's field evaluating his or her research, commenting
on his or her national and international reputation and, if
possible, ranking him or her relative to other Scholars of the
same age.
In striking contrast, no particular form of documentation
is required on a University-wide basis for the evaluation of
teaching. It may consist of informal evaluations by individual
faculty colleagues, andecdotal material supplied in letters
from a few students, or more formal teaching evaluations,
depending on the traditions and policies of the individual
department.
In practice, tenure and promotion committees are com
monly presented with voluminous documentation of research
but relatively meager documentation of teaching. It is there
fore not surprising that they place more emphasis on the
evaluation of research.
It would bring our practice into better accord with our
stated policy if promotion committees were given more
information to help them in their evaluation of teaching so
they could accord to teaching and research the more
balanced weights provided for by the policy statements of
their schools.
In this spirit, we propose that several new procedures be
introduced into the tenure, promotion and salary-setting
processes in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences and Engineering.
In the recommendations below, we use the concepts of
research and teaching as they are generally understood in the
University and defined in the policy statements of the various
schools (see Policies and Procedures, above).
However, we wish to emphasize our belief that classroom
teaching in all its forms—lectures, seminars, laboratory, and
discussion sections—should be given particularly strong em
phasis in the assessment of overall teaching performance.
We urge that a greater commitment be made to under
graduate advising. We recognize the very great importance of
supervision of student research, undergraduate and especially
graduate. But moat undergraduate instruction takes place
inside the classroom, and it is specifically the quality of this
dimension of undergraduate instruction about which there is
increasing concern in the University.
Recommendation 1: Universal Course Evaluation
The Task Fores recommends a policy requiring the
evaluation by students of every course, every time it is
offered, and the inclusion in faculty members' personnel
folders of summary evaluation information for their courses.
This policy should apply to the schools that do undergradu
ate teaching-Humanities and Sciences, Earth Sciences, and
Engineering—and such special undergraduate programs as
SWOPSI, SCIRE, Freshman Seminars, and Undergraduate
Specials.
In these schools and programs, students should evaluate
all graduate and undergraduate courses in which enrollments

are large enough to protect the anonymity of the respondents
(e.g. eight or more students).
While recognizing the need to improve the course evalua
tion forms, the Task Force believes the experience with
comprehensive course evaluation in the Graduate School of
Business, the School of Engineering, and the School of Law
indicates that the process can work effectively to the benefit
of the students, the faculty and the school.
Such student feedback provides quantitative data with
which professors within departments—and across depart
ments—can be compared on various aspects of teaching. It is
precisely this kind of comparison that the Task Force
envisions as an important element in the evaluation process,
complementing other types of teaching evaluations, such as
review by colleagues, that departments find useful.
The evaluation process we propose will enable the Univer
sity to give greater consideration to teaching in tenure
decisions. But even more importantly, regular student feed
back will contribute to the University's ultimate goal of
improving the teaching quality of the entire faculty—both
tenured and nontenured.
First, student course evaluations can often serve as valu
able tools in diagnosing specific aspects of teaching which the
faculty member might wish to improve.
Second, if comparative course evaluation data are regular
ly included in personnel folders and considered (together
with other types of teaching evaluation) in roughly equal
weight to the assessments of research performance, we expect
that faculty commitment to teaching will increase.
The evidence from the studies cited above—as well as
numerous other studies of behavior in organizations—indicate
that people shape their performance according to the struc
ture of rewards they perceive. If faculty members perceive
teaching as being important for promotions and salary in
creases, they will tend to invest a more substantial share of
tneir personal resources in teaching. All the evidence we have
reviewed indicates that Stanford faculty prefer a change in
this direction.
In recommending the universal evaluation of courses by
students, we emphasize that we are aware that teaching has
many dimensions. Students are well-equipped to evaluate
some of these, and faculty are best equipped to evaluate
others. In the following list we have tried to indicate which
aspects of teaching would benefit from student evaluation
and which would not.
Classroom performance. Many professors distrust student
evaluations because they fear that the evaluation may be
based mainly on the charisma of the professor. While it is
true that students appreciate a lively lecturer who is able to
infect them with enthusiasm for the subject, students also
realize that good teaching is not identical with good theater.
Students generally reserve their most favorable evaluations
for instructors who first arouse their interest and imagination
and then deliver the intellectual goods.
Classroom preparation. Fifty minutes is a long time for
students and a professor to spend together when the profes
sor has not done his homework. Conversely students recog
nize and appreciate well-prepared exercises and classroom
presentations. Students are in an excellent position to evalu
ate this aspect of teaching.
Accessibility to students. Having occasional personal con
tacts with professors gives a personal touch to teaching at
Stanford which is not available at many universities with a
less favorable student/teacher ratio. Students are acutely
aware of the availability of professors during their office
hours. Students in courses with large enrollments are aware
that opportunities for faculty contact will be limited. In such
courses it is important to provide an adequate number of
teaching assistants to help the student with difficult parts of
the course. Students are able to evaluate how well this part of
the teaching program has been organized.
Prompt return of papers. The student learns the most
from papers, problem sets and examinations if they are
returned promptly with written comments where appropri
ate. Students are the main source of feedback on this aspect
of teaching.
Course design. This involves tactical considerations such
as designing exercises and course structure in such a way that
the student becomes meaningfully involved with the course.
Here student input can be useful in assessing whether the
course has been successful in eliciting discussion and partici
pation and whether the exercises and exams flowed naturally
from the course content.
Conceptualization of the field. This involves structuring
the field of study in a logical and coherent manner, devel
oping a sound curriculum and insuring that courses are
up-to-date in rapidly developing fields. Here, faculty mem
bers are better equipped than students to evaluate a profes
sor's contribution.
We do not recommend lightly the required evaluation of
every course. Clearly this will mean some increase in paper
work, some increment in the bureaucratization of University
life. It may be necessary to use some portion of class time, 1 5
minutes or so, near the end of the quarter, when time is often
precious. And there will be the inevitable problem of appli
cability which any standard form (or set of alternative forms)
will have when used in as diverse an array of courses as
Stanford offers.

We are sympathetic to these concerns, but believe they
are outweighed by the potential benefits. The favorable
experience of Princeton University with universal course
evaluation demonstrates that it can be instituted without
stifling teaching creativity or bloating the University bureau
cracy.
Furthermore, no evaluation can be thorough and fair in
an area of performance with so many consumers as teaching
unless it is systematic. Although qualitative assessments from
students are valuable, we are convinced that only compara
tive data from standard course evaluation forms can provide a
context in which other kinds of assessments can be fairly and
meaningfully interpreted. Quite simply, we see nu aliernative
to mandatory student course evaluation if the measurement
of teaching quality is to be taken seriously.
However, we do not consider student evaluation the only
useful means of assessing the quality of teaching. Other forms
of teaching evaluation have proven valuable in the overall
assessment process, including various forms of colleague
evaluation.
Not only are colleagues well-suited to evaluate the design
and conceptualization of a course, but they may also be of
value in evaluating the classroom presentation and diagnosing
specific problems which call for improvement. We see ad
vantage for many departments in the arrangement now used
by the Physics Department, whereby each professor is visited
during the year by a colleague (from a panel of two or three)
who attends a lecture, evaluates aspects of the classroom
presentation and makes suggestions for improvement.
Although we think the design of student course evalua
tion forms appropriate for widespread use should be left to
others, we offer some general specifications:
First, any standard form should allow the professor an
option of eliminating certain types of questions or a certain
number ot questions that might not apply to his or her
particular course and its disctinctive structure. It should also
permit the inclusion of additional questions that the instruc
tor may feel are necessary for the adequate evaluation of all
aspects of the course.
Second, thought should be given to the design of separate
forms for seminars, language, and laboratory classes, and any
other special classes or workshops for which the deletion of
some questions and addition of others to a standard form
would be inadequate or inordinately cumbersome.
Third, a single standard form should be used for each type
of course in order to insure maximum comparability of the
evaluations.
Fourth, we believe that a single office or agency within
the University such as the Registrar's Office, the Academic
Information Center or the Academic Planning Office should
be responsible for disseminating the standard forms near the
end of each quarter, collecting them and analyzing the
responses.
Finally, we see no need for the development of a new
standard form for the School of Engineering. This school
already has a comprehensive system of student course evalua
tion. The standard evaluation form it uses has been developed
with great care over time and appears to be successful in
assessing a number of important dimensions of teaching.
Many potential problems can be avoided by drawing on
the experience of schools that have already instituted univer
sal course evaluation. The Graduate School of Business, for
example, has observed a tendency for professors to feel
inhibited from introducing new courses with unfamiliar
material, or substantial innovations in courses that are al
ready successful. The School has sought to alleviate these
concerns by assuring teachers that student course evaluations
are not the only means used to assess teaching, and that less
emphasis is placed on student response if the course is
experimental.
To the extent that these assurances prove insufficient,
however, we can see value in a procedure which allows, once
every two or three years, the option of not having an
experimental course evaluated. Students would evaluate the
course in the normal way, but the evaluation would not have
to pass beyond the personal review of the professor. Such an
option might also be considered for assistant professors in
their first or second quarter of college teaching, when in
some sense their entire presentation as a teacher is experi
mental.
Another problem encountered throughout the University
is the general tendency of students to rate their professors
rather generously in absolute terms. The average score in the
Business School is well over five on a seven point scale where
seven is highest, and is similarly high in undergraduate course
evaluations. This tendency may discourage professors from
taking risks that might offend individual students, since a few
low ratings can appreciably depress the mean evaluation
scores of a professor.
The problem here, we believe, is a technical and statistical
one that is not insurmountable. A small predetermined
percentage of extreme scores on both ends of the scale could
be eliminated in the computation of the mean score for the
professor on any given scale. Or the medial score could be
taken instead (or in addition) as a measure of the overall
tendency of the scores.
In any case, the significant upward bias in teaching
evaluation scores requires that interpretation of the scores be
made against the overall means or medians for faculty in a
given school, rather than against some absolute standard, if
the figures are to be meaningful.
We recommend that summaries of the data for each
course be made available to students for inspection in
libraries, the Academic Information Center and some of the
residence offices. Additionally, we recommend that student
comments be made publicly available in the same way unless
the faculty member objects.
(We recognize that reproduction of all the comments in
large courses may be quite a cumbersome task, but feel this is
a technical matter best left for the standing committee that
would oversee the process. If a sample of the comments in
these large courses is preferred, one possible way to avoid
complaints about poor judgment in selection would be to
simply draw a statistically random sample large enough to
guarantee representativeness.*
Mean and/or median scores on the standard items of
evaluation should be published for each course, along with
the overall means and/or medians for the entire school
faculty on each item, so that meaningful comparisons may be
made between professors and between courses. Given the
substantial financial investment in tuition required of most
Stanford students and their families, we feel it is the
University's responsibility to enable students to inform them
selves as fully as possible about the courses from which they
might choose. Such a program has apparently worked
smoothly at Princeton, where the results of all course
evaluations, in statistical form, are available in the Registrar's
Office for public use.
It has been the practice in the School of Engineering to
make available to students a representative sample of com
ments on the student course evaluations and to release the
comparative data only with the agreement of the professor.
Once again, we urge that the unique traditions for evaluation
of teaching in this school be respected, and that it be left to
the School's discretion whether it will continue to make the
comments available, or provide the data instead, or do both.
Our concern is that some kind of course evaluation informa
tion be regularly available for students to examine.
Finally, we, recommend that statistical summaries of the
data be sent to all departments for inclusion in the faculty
member's personnel or promotion folder. Student comments
should also be sent to the departments unless the professor
objects.
Recommendation 2: Retrospective Student Evaluations of
Teaching
One reservation many faculty have about student course
evaluation is its analogy to the applause at the end of a
concert. It is seen as an expression of the student's instant
reaction, based mainly on classroom performance, and unin
formed by the longer-term impact of the course on the
student's future academic work, his professional career, and
his capacity to lead a rich and fulfilling life.
Another frequently noted problem with student evalua
tions, especially those of freshmen and sophomores, is that
they are offered in something of a vacuum, apart from any
consideration of how the professor compares to others in the
University on the organization of the course, the effective
ness of the assignments, and the clarity and value of the
lectures.
To remedy these deficiencies in the evaluation of teach
ing, the Task Force recommends a program of retrospective
student evaluations of teaching, in which past students of a
professor are asked to compare that faculty member, on
specific dimensons of teaching, to others they have had in the
University, and to evaluate the contribution of his or her
teaching to their overall intellectual, professional and person
al development.
These evaluations would mainly take the form of letters,
structured around a few basic questions, and supplemented
by a few standard questionnaire rating scales. They would be
drawn from a representative sample of seniors and recent
graduates who have taken the professor's course.
We believe this kind of program would provide a needed
balance in student input, eliciting reflecting and comparative
assessments that the present course evaluation process is
unable to capture. Students at the end of their undergraduate
careers, and those two or three years beyond it, can provide a
distinctive perspective in evaluating their teachers-more
mature, more carefully considered, more informed by the
broader and longer-term impact of the professor and the
course. Such evaluations, we believe, would open the way for
recognition of the earnest but undramatic teacher whose
subtle style of presentation and intellectual challenge may be
longer in consciously affecting the student, or whose most
dramatic impact may be in individual contact and advising.
In addition, we recommend that a sample of the profes
sor's past undergraduate advisees be asked to assess retrospec
tively the quality of his advising. Such a system of evaluating
advising would enable tenure and promotion committees to
give some consideration to this dimension of the faculty
member's contribution to undergraduate education and could
reinforce other efforts to improve the quality and compre
hensiveness of the undergraduate advising program.
Recommendation 3: A University Committee for the Compa
rative Assessment of Teaching in the Schools of Humanities
and Sciences, Earth Sciences, and Engineering.

As we have noted, one major obstacle to a policy of
symmetry in the handling of teaching and research criteria
has been the difficulty in making comparative evaluations of
teaching.
To remedy this problem, we recommend the creation of a
standing committee on teaching evaluation (composed of
students, faculty, and administrators) for the purpose of
making precisely those cross-departmental assessments of
teaching quality that individual departments are ill-equipped
to undertake.
In forming its judgments, it would rely heavily on the
retrospective student assessments discussed above, as well as
on past student course evaluations.
This committee would operate across the three schools
that do undergraduate teaching—Humanities and Sciences,
Earth Sciences, and Engineering—and would develop and
oversee universal course evaluation programs in the former
two Schools, where there is not now such a program.
The present committee structure of the Academic Senate
does not appear to provide an adequate mechanism for
implementing decisions of the Senate concerning the evalua
tion of teaching. The Resolution on Evaluation of Teaching
(Senate Document No. 1215) adopted on Nov. 29, 1973
states that "Every faculty member should have at least one of
his or her courses evaluated by students no less frequently
than every three years; and that a standard questionnaire
approved by the Dean of the School should be one compo
nent of student evaluation of teaching."
Even this mild resolution has not been implemented on a
university-wide basis. It therefore seems necessary to form a
new committee specifically charged with implementing and
monitoring the program of student evaluation we recom
mend.
As for the cross-departmental assessment of teaching, we
are convinced that such a task is feasible. The work of the
Subcommittee on Awards of the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement demonstrates that a nondepart
mental committee can make comparative assessments of
teaching across very different departments within the Univer
sity. Their awards deliberations, and those of Dean Royden
in Humanities and Sciences, emphasize that there are impor
tant aspects of teaching that transcend departmental lines
and enable comparisons between teachers in fields as diverse
as poetry, politics, and high energy physics.
If existing policies on appointments and promotions are
to be effectively implemented, this process must be expanded
to include not merely candidates for awards, but all teachers
being considered for promotion within the above three
Schools, especially promotion to tenure.
The standing committee we propose might operate in a
manner comparable to that currently employed by the
Subcommittee on Awards and many departmental review
committees: assigning each candidate for promotion to a
working group which would not only review the retrospective
student assessments and past course evaluation data but also
probe further through interviews with selected students and
colleagues (especially those outside the department with
whom the professor might have taught).
The committee would then write a confidential summary
report, early enough to be included in the evaluation material
that is sent to all faculty members in the department who
will review the candidate for promotion. Because many
negative decisions on promotion are effectively made at the
departmental level, we believe it essential that the assessment
of this University committee be considered at this first stage
in the appointments and promotions process.
This procedure for the evaluation of teaching would
provide a symmetry with the research evaluation process that
has been absent until now. Just as the departmental commit
tees seek letters of evaluation of the candidate's research in a
national context of comparison, so the committee we pro
pose would seek data evaluating the candidate's teaching in a
university-wide context of comparison.
Departmental reviewers would be able to consider outside
comparative assessments of both teaching and research, along
with their own evaluations of their colleague's work in both
areas and the course evaluation data and information already
in the folder. They would then be as well prepared to judge
whether a candidate meets the rigorous test of being among
the best teachers in the University as they are now prepared
to judge whether a candidate meets the high standard of
being among the best researchers in the nation in his or her
specific field.
This is not to say that either process is immune from
error, but that a University committee for the comparative
evaluation of teaching would provide a symmetry of struc
ture and procedure to match the symmetrical criteria for
promotion that we believe are in the best interests of the
University. And as we noted above, the committee would
provide another kind of symmetry as well -balancing a
reflective view against what is often seen as the more instant,
impressionistic feedback of in-class course evaluations
Because this standing committee would be charged with
assessing all faculty candidates for promotion in these
schools, it would have to be a hard-working group. We do not
see its task as overwhelming, however.
A membership comparable in size with most University
committees, supported by a small data and letter-gathering
staff from the Registrar's Office, the Academic Information

Center, or some similar office, could perform the necessary
assessment for the 20 or so junior professors who are
annually candidates for tenure, plus the 20 or so associate
professors who are candidates for promotion to full profes
sors.
It might be advantageous, however, for the committee
members to have somewhat longer terms of service than
usual, so that they might develop experience and skill over
time in making comparative judgments of teaching quality. In
addition we believe that the committee's work would be
streamlined if it coordinated its investigations with the
Subcommittee on Awards, building upon the substantial
reviews the latter has already performed on many of the
professors who will be under consideration for promotion.
While we do not feel this standing committee would
regularly be able to undertake summary assessments of full
professors, we do believe that these retrospective evaluations
of teaching should be collected for them about once very
seven years, as additional input for both the determination of
their salaries and the improvement of their teaching.
This information would be gathered by the administrative
staff serving the committee and passed on directly to the
departments for inclusion in the professor's personnel folder.
The members of the committee would not need to be
involved in this process.
Recommendation 4: Faculty Awards for Excellence in
Teaching
The Task Force recommends that the new standing
committee on teaching evaluation select a certain number of
professors each year to receive teaching awards, in the form
of permanent salary increases over and above normal in
creases.
This procedure was recently instituted in the School of
Humanities and Sciences by Dean Halsey Royden and was
well received by students and faculty. We feel it should now
be expanded to encompass all three Schools that do under
graduate teaching.
Since this standing cummittee has as its purpose the
comparative assessment of teaching across departments, it
would be particularly well suited to award these prizes,
relying heavily on various kinds of student evaluations (both
quantitative and qualitative), and on whatever peer evalua
tion the departments feel would be appropriate for the
committee to consider.
These teaching prizes are very much the kind of tangible
change in the reward structure that can alter faculty percep
tions about the importance of teaching in the rewards
process, and therefore encourage them to improve their
teaching.
Although tenure decisions are the part of the University
reward structure which receive the greatest public attention,
most teaching is done by professors who have already
received tenure. Salaries constitute an important part of the
University reward structure for these professors and in some
departments are skewed in favor of faculty who have empha
sized research rather than teaching.
This does not seem to reflect an articulated University
policy, but rather is the cumulative effect of individual
responses by department chairpersons and deans to attractive
job offers received by professors on the basis of their
reputations in research. Good teaching, on the other hand, is
recognized mainly within the University community and does
not generate competitive pressure for salary increases.
The awards would serve to bring the reward structure into
harmony with the University policy of achieving a balance
between teaching and research.
One possible manner in which the committee might
proceed would be to review each faculty member once every
seven years. The review would consist of considering sum
maries of individual course reviews for the past seven years,
conducting a retrospective survey among former students of
the professor and evaluating this survey.
In addition, the committee would consider, at the profes
sor's request, information supplied by his or her department
about the professor's contribution to curriculum develop
ment and other aspects of good teaching not visible to the
student. We propose that about 20 awards for excellence in
teaching be made each year. Since roughly 80 faculty would
be reviewed annually in these three Schools, this would mean
that the top one-fourth of the faculty under review in a given
year would receive awards.
During a professor's career at Stanford he or she would
have four or five opportunities to receive this tangible form
of recognition at intervals of seven years. The cumulative
increase in salary attained by the truly outstanding teacher
would thus tend to be more nearly in balance with the salary
of the truly outstanding researcher.
Recommendation 5: New Appointments
The Task Force recommends that it be University polir /
that every search committee gather as detailed an appraisal as
possible of the teaching quality of the candidates they are
considering for a faculty appointment.
We believe that the symmetrical procedures for the
evaluation of teaching and research should be instituted,
insofar as is possible, for new appointments as well. Though
standardized evaluations of teaching are more difficult to
obtain in a national search, we believe it is possible to make
teaching evaluation a more systematic process, even for
candidates for appointment from outside the University.
We urge that it be standard University procedure for every
search committee to seek some kind of quantitative student
evaluation data about every candidate under serious conside
ration for a faculty appointment who has previous teaching
experience. Where appropriate, search committees should
invite the candidates themselves to submit this data.
These student evaluations could come from a university,
departmental, or self-designed form, but the key point is that
the search committee make the attempt to obtain and review
them if they exist. In the absence of standard course
evaluation data, the appraisal of the candidate's teaching
could be based on student letters of evaluation, systematical
ly solicited from a sample of the professor's students, which
might be supplemented by assessments from colleagues and
others in a position to know about the quality of the
professor's teaching.
In addition, each search committee should obtain a list of
courses taught by the candidates under consideration and, if
feasible, information on any contributions they may have
made to the development of new curricula.
A message of these intentions and concerns with respect
to new appointments, communicated throughout the nation
al (and international) academic community, would be an
important first step in enabling the teaching ability of outside
candidates to be evaluated as systematically and rigorously as
is their research.
We are not suggesting, of course, that an outside candi
date be eliminated from consideration if evaluations of his or
her teaching are not available. Neither are we suggesting that
search committees risk insulting eminent professors who may
not have indicated whether they would consider coming to
Stanford if they were invited. We would expect that all
inquiries would be handled with discretion, sensitivity and
common sense
We do feel, however, that there is widespread recognition
of the increasingly explicit consideration that many univer
sities are giving to teaching in making faculty appointments,
and we see no reason why even the most eminent of scholars
will be offended by a polite inquiry about their teaching that
comes as part of a search process that they are aware of, for a
position that they would consider accepting.
Our main concern is that when a recommendation for a
new appointment reaches the Provost's office, there be
evidence of the candidate's teaching ability, or evidence that
every reasonable attempt was made to gather as much
information in this respect as was available.
VII OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM FOR
THE EVALUATION OF TEACHING
We present here an overview of how our recommended
procedures would operate, step by step. Individual depart
ments would remain at the heart of tha evaluation process
and would continue to carry primary responsibility for
evaluating the effectiveness of a professor's teaching on the
basis of colleague reviews, contributions to the development
of the department's teaching program and student evalua
tions of teaching.
The main role of the new committee would be to
summarize, in comparative terms, the evaluations of teaching
effectiveness as perceived by students. Evaluations of individ
ual courses would be provided directly to professors and
departments, and summary evaluations would be provided to
departments prior to major promotion and tenure decisions.
The new committee would be charged with oveiseeing and
implementing the following three types of evaluation.
I. Course Evaluation
1. The office in the University charged with adminis
tering the course evaluation program would send the appro
priate evaluation forms to all professors teaching courses in
the three Schools.
2. Professors would pass out the forms in class at a time
of their choice, collect them and return them immediately to
the administrative office for analysis. At that time, the
professor would have the option of registering his or her
objection to the release of the comments. Returns would be
monitored by this office and the new standing committee on
evaluation to insure coverage of all appropriate courses.
3. The administrative office would statistically analyze
and summarize the responses for each course, and also
compute school or departmental means and/or medians for
each question. Student comments would be reproduced for
those courses where the professor had not objected to their
release.
4. A copy of the statistical summary, along with the
original responses, would be returned to the professor as soon
as the administrative processing was completed. A copy of
the statistical summary, and of the comments if the professor
did not obiect, would be sent to the department head for
inclusion in the faculty member's personnel folder.
5. A statistical summary of the student responses and a
reproduction of the comments (if the professor had not
obiected) would be made available for students to examine in
designated places around the University

II. The Review Process for Candidates for Promotion to
Tenured Ranks and to Full Professor
1. For professors about to be considered for promotion
to tenure or to full professor, the University office which
administers the course evaluation would gather retrospective
evaluations by seniors and recent alumni. It would also gather
together their past student course-evaluation data.
2. Based on the retrospective and course evaluations, the
standing committee would write a comparative summary
evaluation.
3. This confidential written summary would be
forwarded to the department for inclusion in the promotion
file and for consideration—along with whatever other teach
ing evaluations it deemed appropriate—in the department's
deliberation regarding the proposed promotion.
• II. The Review Process for Awards and Salary Determina
tion
1. Full professors in the three schools would be con
sidered once every seven years for a special salary award for
outstanding teaching.
2. Also entering the eligible pool for an award each year
would be assistant and associate professors under considera
tion for promotion that year.
3. The bases for the awards would be (a) evaluations of
individual courses, (b) retrospective evaluations by senior
students and recent alumni and (c) departmental colleague
evaluations if the department chairman elects to forward
these to the committee.
4. Based on this information, the committee would each
year select, about a quarter of the eligible pool to receive
awards for outstanding teaching in the form of permanent
salary increases.
5. The retrospective evaluations conducted every seven
years for the purpose of making the awards would be
forwarded to the individual professors and to their depart
ments.
ASSU LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE
The Council of Presidents hereby accepts the report of
the COP Task Force on Tenure and Teaching Quality. We
would like to commend and thank the members of the Task
Force for their willingness to serve the University community
in this effort.
To our knowledge, no such Task Force has ever been
constituted by the officers of the ASSU, and we find it
encouraging that such an excellent group of persons volun
teered their time and energies to study this crucial issue.
We are most pleased with this report, the final outcome of
several months of intensive interviews, meetings, and discus
sions, and hope that it will be thoughtfully considered by the
entire Stanford community.

VIII. APPENDIX
Summary of Discussion With Prof. James Gibbs, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. July 1976
Dean Gibbs felt that the fi rst job of the task force ought to be a
clear delineation of how the tenure process operates, and
particularly how the key components of the tenure decision,
teaching and research, are evaluated.
He noted his own opinion that more weight in appointments
and promotions is unlikely to be given to teaching until we have
evaluation procedures in teaching that the faculty have confi
dence in. One way to boost faculty confidence is to stress
multiple sources of evaluation, including student evaluation,
peer evaluation, and self-evaluation. Such multiple forms of
evaluation taken together produce more valid results and,
therefore, reduce faculty anxiety over the entire process, and
over student evaluations in particular.
Student evaluation can include letters and other less struc
tured assessments, but it is Dean Gibbs' very strong feeling
that some kind of quantative and comparative data such as that
gathered by in-class questionnaires ought to be required. He is
particularly impressed with the approach in the Engineering
and Business Schools where, periodically, all teachers are
evaluated by students on standard forms to establish norms
against which faculty can be regularly compared on the various
dimensions of teaching measured in these forms.
Colleague evaluation is an important element, he feels, but
one which suffers from certain handicaps as well as certain
advantages The advantages are clear; certain dimensions of
teaching — the selection of readings and structure of assign
ments, the quality of exams, the intellectual coherence of the
course — are perhaps best assessed by a professor's col
leagues. Even in the classroom, a colleague of the professor
may be better equipped to judge when that professor is being
intellectually superficial or one-sided in his presentation
But a peer evaluation system among professors faces the
dual problem of faculty anxiety on the one hand and a faculty
"halo effect' on the other For such a peer evaluation system to
work well and fairly, the professor must be able to choose when
a colleague visits his class, and it may be best to have several
visits (perhaps by different people, as is done in Religious
Studies) rather than one At the same time, faculty must be

willing to be frank in their evaluations, and critical of their
colleagues when cnticism is called for.
Self-evaluation should be considered as another aspect of
the multi-dimensional evaluation process. Surprisingly few fa
culty presently take advantage of the opportunity for this, how
ever. A large number of faculty members choose not to fill out
the section on their appointment forms offering them an oppor
tunity to make evaluative comments on their own teaching and
research.
Quality of graduate teaching must also be carefully asses
sed, not only because it is important in its own right, but be
cause some groat and dedicated trainers of graduate students
aren't very good with undergraduates, just as the excellent
seminar leader may be only adequate in lecturing to a large
class. Graduate teaching includes teaching graduate seminars
and classes as well as directing dissertation research. These
different dimensions of the teaching process, both graduate
and undergraduate, must each be given adequate considera
tion in any evaluation process.
The evaluation of research is seen by most professors, in
Dean Gibbs' view, as a much more precise process. Referees,
by and large, are using the same data, the candidate's publica
tions. Dean Gibbs feels this adds to the precision of the process
and to its validity.
He noted that the letters from outside professionals compar
ing the candidate with the top three or four people in the country
at a similar level of development get quite detailed and precise
in evaluating the candidate s research and scholarship.
Careful attention is given to the impact of the professor on the
sub-discipline he has specialized in; his impact on graduate
students and their collective impact on the sub-discipline; the
papers at major conferences which the professor has been
invited to give; the nature and originality of the intellectual
problem pursued — whether it focuses on challenging issues at
the frontier of the field or on narrow sub-paths of a trail some
one else has blazed, and whether it is interdisciplinary or not.
This part of the overall evaluation process in tenure delibera
tions has been tightened up in the last few years by asking the
department chairpersons to provide a kind of "cognitive map''
of the referees (what competing schools of analysis they come
from, etc.) so university officials may know how to assess their
letters of evaluation.
A second, related question Dean Gibbs urged the task force
to consider is the degree to which criteria for appointments and
promotions are uniform across departments. It is his feeling
that the process has improved considerably in uniformity and
reliability during his tenure as Dean, that departments are
increasingly presenting more systematic evidence of teaching
evaluation.
But difficulties remain, as in the English Department, where
exclusive reliance on student letters prevents quantification of
assessments by students and enables every student to select
different aspects of the instructor's teaching to comment on,
and every reviewer to abstract from the letter's different points
and impressions Again, he underscored the need for use of
student questionnaires which can provide uniform kinds of data
on each professor's teaching.
A third fruitful area for investigation Dean Gibbs recom
mended is the communication problem, or perceptual problem,
if you will. Contrary to some faculty and student suspicions,
Dean Gibbs has found the evaluation process for prospective
appointees to be very thorough and careful, with many depart
ment chairpersons spending quite a bit of time assembling the
appointment folder.
The massive publicity given to the few controversial cases
have planted widespread false impressions about the tenure
process, he feels. One corrective measure might be systematic
publication, month by month, of who gets tenure, so the stu
dents could see that good teachers are quietly being promoted
all the time.
Another element in the communication problem is the pro
fessor who comes here knowing the criteria for tenure but
choosing not to focus his professional activity around them.
Often such people still complain bitterly when tenure is denied
them, and in such instances it is usefuf for the Stanford com
munity to be aware of the fact that sometimes professors are
denied tenure by their own choice, in effect.
Though he has not personally had any knowledge of tenure
being denied to anyone for political or personal reasons, Dean
Gibbs was not ready to dismiss these allegations as completely
groundless. His own assessment is that the system already
has built-in safeguards against appointment decisions being
based on political or personal criteria.
However, he felt it important for the Task Force to determine
for itself to what extent the procedures are mampulable, and
open to subversion, and what is done when there is suspicion
of such subversion The suspicion that political or personal
criteria can determine an appointment is a cloud which he
hopes the Task Force can clear up one way or another, inves
tigating individual circumstances if necessary.
On other issues, Dean Gibbs expressed these thoughts
—On requiring teaching evaluation, he noted that faculty are
anxious about student evaluations, especially published ones,
and that any requirement that would be accepted by the faculty
would have to be somewhat flexible as to the particular form
used, and whether or not the results are published
Important steps in easing faculty anxiety include improve
ments in the Course Guide (stressing less the question of
student "enjoyment of courses"), a more responsible treatment
of the tenure issue by the Daily, and more education of students
(through the Daily and other means) about the research faculty
is doing. The image faculty have of students as uniformly being
both naive and disposed to make quick and superficial as
sessments must be corrected.
—On hiring professors who are outstanding teachers but
only good researchers, Dean Gibbs pointed out that because
no single teaching style appeals to all types of students it is
more difficult to get a uniformly raving assessment of a per
son's teaching than to get such an unblemished evaluation of a
research record. This is one reason why the great teacher
good researcher is less frequently identified and hired than the
great researcher-good teacher, though some of the former
have been promoted to tenure.
—As for involvement by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
in the appointments and promotions process, Dean Gibbs said
he chose to be involved later in the process, at the Provostial
level (rather than at the School level) partly because of the
extraordinary time demand of reviewing every case at the
School level.
Ideally, he now feels that the Dean should be involved sys
tematically at the Provostial level and selectively at the School
level. Because the critical juncture in so many of the difficult
cases is at the School level, and because many see the Dean's
effectiveness as an advocate for undergraduate interests
primarily at this lower level in the tenure process, it is important
for the Dean to have the option of involvement with the ap
pointments and promotions committees of the Schools (H & S
in particular).
Summary of Discussion With Vice Provost William F.
Massy, July, 1976
Professor Massy outlined five dimensions of teaching which
should be considered in any overall assessment of teaching
effectiveness:
1. Conceptualization of the material: structuring the field of
study in a logical and coheient fashion; developing a sound
curriculum and/or a course which nests well in that curriculum.
Here faculty members are better oquipped than students to
evaluate the professor's contribution.
2. Course design: involves process-oriented rather than
substantive considerations — designing the course materials,
exercises and class structure in such a way that meaningful
student involvement is generated. Here student input can be
valuable in assessing whether the course has been successful
in eliciting discussion and participation, whether the exercises
and exams have flowed naturally from the course consent, etc
3. Classroom preparation: preparing for the day's class;
including thinking through the day's objectives and the specific
approach to be used, and simply refreshing the mind of the
day's materials. Student evaluation again is very important
here.
4 Classroom performance: this may not be so crucial if the
previous two are well done. While this is measurable by stu
dents, the degree to which natural charisma (or lack thereof)
often dominates this dimension should make it perhaps less
important an element in the overall assessment.
5. Time availability: for offering students feedback on pap
ers and written comments, and for personal contact, advising
and other activities normally associated with the holding of
office hours. Because students' greatest desire for access is to
professors who have performed well on dimensions 1 through
4, and such access can become an open-ended affair, there is
a need to consider some standard of accessibility other than
simply whether every student's desire for access has been
met.
Summary of Discussion With Prof. Robert Jaedicke, As
sociate Dean of the Graduate School of Business
The GSB examines three aspects of a faculty member's
teaching ability when he or she is due for reappointment or
tenure classroom performance, program course and de
velopment, and individual supervision of students, especially
those in the Ph D program.
Performance in the classroom is evaluated mainly through
mandatory student evaluation forms, which are distributed in
class by a student designated by the professor The forms call
for scaled ratings of the instructor's teaching ability and written
comments.
Statistics are tabulated by the dean s office, which returns
the final tabulation and the forms to the professor. The office
retains a copy of the computer print-out and gives a copy of the
data on second-year elective courses (all first-year courses are
mandatory) to the presidents of the student organizations (ie ,
the MBA Association) for distribution to the general student
body Commonts are read only-by the professor
Dean Jaed cke noted there are some dysfunctional effects of
course evaluation He feels that professors are sometimes
inhibited from drastically changing a course that is already
successful and from starting new courses with unfamiliar mate
rial To alleviate these effects, teachers are assured that
course evaluations are not the sole indicator of good or poor
teaching, and that less emphasis is placed on student re
sponse if the course is experimental

New teachers may request that no data on their first year of
teaching be recorded in the dean's office, although they are
required to conduct the evaluation in class Course evaluation
is required for every class every quarter.
The norm on nearly all ratings tends to be high (closer to 7 on
a scale from 1 to 7). Therefore, a rating of 1 will hurt a teacher
more than a 7 will help.
A yearly report on the second aspect of teaching, program
course and development, is submitted by every faculty
member. Professors are requested to list all new case mate
rials, textbooks they have wntten, class syllabi and a descrip
tion of his or her course development activities of the preceding
year.
When an individual is being considered for reappointment,
peer evaluation is solicited from senior members of his or her
field by the dean's office.
A professor's individual supervision of Ph.D. candidates is
judged by peers and students Dean Jaedicke confers With the
director of the Ph.D. program about a particular professor
whose contract is about to terminate. He also writes every
student who completed his or her doctorate under the profes
sor's supervision, asking for letters of evaluation.
External and internal evaluation of research (work that re
sults in publication, excluding textbooks) is conducted when a
professor is considered for promotion or tenure. Dean Jaedicke
was careful to point out that a promotion from an assistant to
associate professorship does not guarantee (or even imply
promise of) tenure to anyone
The GSB strives for a balance between teaching and re
search, although Dean Jaedicke said "emphasis is placed on
research by the individual," which he termed the "more sale
able commodity.'' He said the ratio of emphasis placed on
research over teaching may be 60/40, but is certainly not 90/10.
He also said a young faculty member could "burn out" trying
to do high-quality research and teaching at the same time. For
this reason, the GSB has chosen not to require new faculty
members to teach many classes with small numbers of stu
dents, but rather it asks them to teach mostly larger courses
and then provides release time for research.
Dean Jaedicke stressed the importance of a strong research
base for the Ph.D. program, and said he would rather maintain
a strong emphasis on research and raise the emphasis on
teaching, not lower the former to match the latter.
He also said he would be willing to lower the minimum
standard (as stated in the GSB policy) to hire the Nobel Prize
researcher who is not inclined toward teaching or the excep
tional teacher who does little research if a school-wde balance
could be maintained. He noted that the Nobel Prize researcher
may be a poor MBA teacher but a good Ph D supervisor, and
therefore may make up for a weakness in one level of teaching.
Finally, Dean Jaedicke noted the severity of the competition
in the GSB. In addition to evaluating a professor's teaching and
research record, the Appointments and Promotions Committee
reads the faculty member's personal statement on what is
important in teaching and research and examines a file which
includes the number of courses taught, the number of students
in those classes, a description of the doctoral activity super
vised by the professor, and publications.
Summary of Discussion With Dean of Earth Sciences
Richard H. Jahns
Dean Jahns indicated that the system for evaluation of teach
ing at the school is an informal one. relying heavily on an
effective program of colleague monitoring.
Decisions about whether and how frequently courses should
be evaluated by students are left up to the discretion of the
individual professor. Because of the effectiveness of the sys
tem of peer evaluation, Dean Jahns noted, the teaching and
advising performances of all faculty members are fairly well
understood by their colleagues
Three factors have served to minimize embarassment and
awkwardness in informal peer evaluation.
First, there is an increasing amount of team teaching in the
School, which gives some faculty an opportunity to observe
each other's teaching and make suggestions for improvement
in a natural and comfortable atmosphere.
Second, among the visiting professors in the School each
year are one or more who usually sit in and subsequently
comment on some courses of their temporary colleagues.
Third, some of the regular faculty enjoy attending the lec
tures of others to learn of new advances in various fields,
affording them an opportunity to assess the classroom presen
tation as well.
In addition to these factors, there is a general ethic in the
School that regards mutual criticism and advice as both ap
propnate and important, and department chairmen are "very
faithful about communicating in a personal way with faculty
members who are having trouble with their teaching."
Dean Jahns is concerned about what he perceives as a
decreasing tendency among professors in the School to use
student course evaluation forms. He feels that while colleagues
can assess the substance of a course more thoroughly than
students, students are best equipped to evaluate teaching
techniques, and their observations of substance are much
more acute than we tend to give them credit for."
In addition to the inherent value of student feedback, Dean
Jahns observed that the Provost's office is demanding increas
ingly explicit documentation of teaching quality, including evi
dence of student evaluation more systematic than just a few

letters. Candidates tor promotion who are unable to present
such evidence are correspondingly handicapped, he believes.
With respect to new appointments, Dean Jahns stated that
the School will not accept a new faculty member "unless there
is evidence of a very strong personal commitment to teaching
While it is difficult to state in quantitative terms the balance
between research and teaching as criteria for promotion, Dean
Jahns estimates that it is somewhere in the area of 60/40, with
research counting more heavily than teaching.
This balance stems from the belief that "if an individual is not
an outstanding scholar, with active drives toward research and
scholarly inquiry, that person cannot be an outstanding
teacher"
Teaching is a very strong concern in the School, however,
and Dean Jahns expressed hope that a more rigorous system
of checks and balances." perhaps akin to that now used to
evaluate research, could be developed to evaluate teaching.
Summary of Discussion With Wllam Kays, Dean of the
School of Engineering
Systematic evaluation of teaching in the School of Engineer
ing began in the 1960's and has continuously been adminis
tered by Tau Beta Pi, a student society in the School.
In the early 1960's the survey results were confidential to the
faculty member, although many shared the results with their
department heads and the Dean when they felt it was in their
interest to do so.
In the late 1960 sit became mandatory for candidates for
promotion to submit teaching evaluations, but the evidence to
be submitted remained at the discretion of the candidate Ex
cept where released by the faculty member, the survey results
were not available to the student body.
Today Tau Beta Pi attempts to evaluate every course every
quarter. Tau Beta Pi has now revised the format of the evalua
tion instrument so that two parts are used today.
The first part of the form rates aspects of the course on a
numencal scale, for comparison against school-wide aver
ages. This part of the form is confidential, and the results are
given only to the instructor.
The second part of the evaluation asks for open comments
on aspects of the course Representative comments are
selected by a committee of students and are published by Tau
Beta Pi, with the School paying for the printing.
Dean Kays feels that these comments are useful, and
strongly favors continuation of the program.
Dean Kays also likes the publication of comments because it
acts as a consumer guide for students in the masters program
in engineering. These students come in fresh with no idea of
the quality of the courses at Stanford, and he feels that the
evaluation comments give valuable guidance to these stu
dents.
There have been problems, Dean Kays pointed out, espe
cially in complaints from those professors who have received
poor reviews. These professors claim the comments are too
subjective, arid givfe too much potential for unfair reviews by
students.
The Chemical Engineering Department is especially op
posed to the student surveys, and has barred the evaluation of
their courses. Dean Kays, however, feels that the Tau Beta Pi
students have been fair in their selection of comments for
publication, and believes that the program will gain complete
acceptance in the School in a few years.
Dean Kays is receptive to the idea of a University program for
mandatory course evaluation but prefers that the School of
Engineering continue with the program it has developed. He
would rather have subjective student comments than statistical
data because the comments highlight information that may be
hidden in numencal data.
Dean Kays especially likes the idea of surveying seniors and
recent graduates for evaluation of professors they have had
He would like to conduct a comprehensive survey of Engineer
ing graduates and compare it with a comprehensive survey
taken in the School about five years ago, to see if their evalua
tions will have changed over time Dean Kays suspects they
will not have changed.
Dean Kays has some reservations about the effectiveness of
a program of awards for excellence in teaching. He places his
major emphasis on the improvement of poor teaching in the
School, and feels that awards for excellence would only moti
vate the portion of the faculty who are already good teachers,
and not the poor teachers who need to improve but have little
hope of winning an award.
Summary of Discussions With Haisey Roy den. Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
Commenting on the School's statement of tenure proce
dures and criteria. Dean Royden noted that balance between
teaching and research is the main obiective of the School,
althougn some professors will naturally be promoted more for
their teaching than their research, and vice-versa
Dean Royden estimated that in about 80% of recent promo
tions, the professor's strengths have tended to be more on the
scholarly side, but he recalled a number of individuals in the last
few years whose teaching was the criterion that "tipped the
scales'' in favor of or against their promotion.
Particularly in the present period, when universities are en
tering a "buyers market," Dean Royden feels that "there is no
excuse for not appointing faculty members who are very skillful
at both research and teaching."
Dean Royden believes that Humanities and Sciences is now
reasonably well balanced between research and teaching, and
cited the H&S Teaching Awards as an example of the School's
attempt to balance the financial rewards for research with
explicit rewards for teaching as well.
Dean Royden indicated that he would, in any case, be most
reluctant to promote a professor who had not manifested
strong signs of scholarly interest and activity, though these
would not necessarily always result in publications.
It is his feeling that important reasons for students choosing
to come to Stanford are the chance for individual work with
knowledgable faculty on research projects and the general
creative intellectual atmosphere generated by top-quality fa
culty. Both of these, he believes, require a faculty with strong
interests in research and scholarship.
Dean Royden feels that scholarship tends to be a "more
critical gauge" than teaching in that good college teaching is
more common and that there is considerable correlation bet
ween scholarly interest and life-long good teaching. ,
He noted that a problem with basing promotion on teaching is
that it is easier to predict the calibre of a professor's future
research than to predict the quality of his future teaching He
cited the example of the young professor who begins teaching
with great energy and devotion but who later ends up teaching
old fashioned and out of date material.
In terms of present procedures for evaluation of teaching,
Dean Royden expressed his personal belief that department
chairmen were qualified to judge the teaching quality of the
professors in their department, and that student course evalua
tions were mainly useful as an external instrument for docu
menting these assessments He also stressed the importance
of colleague evaluation of the structure, design and intellectual
content of courses.
Dean Royden expressed some reservation about universal

student course evaluation, noting in particular the potential for
excessive bureaucratic workload and the shortcomings of pre
sent evaluation forms.
However, he indicated that the School's Appointments and
Promotions Committee now examines the published course
reviews even if the department does not submit them, and he
noted that "students should not underestimate the effect of
these reviews." In general, he feels the comments on these
course evaluations have proven more valuable than the
straight statistical information.
The general goal of evaluation efforts should be the raising of
consciousness about teaching in departments and the con
tinuous improvement of the quality of teaching, he observed.
Dean Royden expressed confidence that at various levels
within the administration, good teaching is highly valued and
appreciated The main problem is in perceptions, he feels, and
the challenge is to develop visible demonstrations that teach
ing does in fact count.
Summary by Al Tomaszczuk of phone conversation with
Bruce Finnie, Registrar at Princeton University, Nov. 24,
1876.
The intent of my call was to find out more about the effective
ness and impact of Princeton's system of mandatory course
evaluation. The following is a summary of our discussion.
i) Mr Finnie emphasized that the mandatory'' aspect of
the course evaluation was not enforced with a "big-stick men
tality," but rather through the use of "moral suasion.' Mr. Finnie
pointed out that he does monitor "consistent non-compliance"
with the rules regarding course evaluation, but stated that his
office took a "low profile" in insuring faculty use of the course
evaluation. Generally, almost all of the faculty voluntarily com
ply with the Registrar's system of course evaluation.
Mr, Finnie stated that the student evaluations are completed
on the day of the final examination or on the last regular class
day in the absence of a final. Mr. Finnie added that the course

evaluations for courses without finals were difficult to adminis
ter primarily because the attendance rate of students in these
classes tended to be low during the final week of instruction.
2) Mr. Finnie noted that "students don't take the course
evaluations as seriously as they used to," and that "the re
volutionary fervor" supporting a mandatory course evaluation
has passed. He cited the return/response rate of students as
the biggest problem with the system, noting that the student
response rate averaged 65%. Mr. Finnie added that some
students write their own reviews of the course taught, and then
publish these (similar to the ASSU Course Guide), although he
pointed out that this effort was irregular from year to year.
3) Mr. Finnie specifically stated that the Princeton "Commit
tee of Three," a group which apparently performs a function
similar to Stanford's Advisory Board or A&P Committee, uses
the results from the course evaluation "more and more."
He stated that the tight job market at Princeton has "in
creased the viability of the course evaluations," and noted that
many faculty were anxious to discover their ratings at the end of
each term. Mr. Finnie added that faculty place considerable
importance upon their ratings in the course evaluations, and he
noted that "the faculty haven't raised questions about the exis
tence of a mandatory course evaluation in 5 years."
He also stated that his office now sends the "Committee of
Three" a longitudinal survey of all the course evaluations every
faculty member (including those under consideration for prom
otion or salary increases) has received for courses taught in the
last five years; he added that since the "Committee of Three'
has found this information so useful, he plans on sending the
information to department chairpersons as well (at the sugges
tion of the Dean of the Faculty).
4) Mr. Finnie concluded by pointing out that there is an
appreciable bureaucratic effort involved in distributing, collect
ing, and evaluating the forms. He stated that it takes approxi
mately V/ 2 months "to clean up the mess before all the reports
actually go into the computer," primarily because students
sometimes fill out the forms incorrectly, necessitating their
individual correction.
