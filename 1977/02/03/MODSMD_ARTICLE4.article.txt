# SLAC picket line disperses

### Bill Burger 
Operations at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
were "back to 100 per cent normal" yesterday, Bernard
Lighthouse, SLAC personnel manager, said as picket lines
at the Sandhill Road entrance to SLAC came down.
The lines were set up Monday and Tuesday by Local 377
of the International Association of Bridge, Structural and
Ornamental Ironworkers and Riggers.
Several picketers remained at the Alpine Road entrance
but their presence didn't prevent any construction workers
or supply trucks from reaching the site of SLAC expansion
construction, according to Lighthouse.
Lighthouse said Tuesday that about 25 trucks bringing
supplies to SLAC, as well as to the construction site, turned
back at the Sandhill Road gate. He also said that some
projects were being affected by a lack of supplies.
A union official said Tuesday that the picket lines were
set up to "inform" the public about alleged affirmative
action and safety regulations violations by the Solano
County Construction Co. Solano is a subcontractor
employed by M&H Construction Co., the prime contractor

for SLAC expansion.
The owner of Solano said she would hire a minority
worker by the end of this week and that she was sure her
company is in compliance with safety regulations.
University Assoc. Staff Counsel Gerald Halligan said yes
terday afternoon that he doesn't expect the National Labor
Relations Board to push a proposed temporary injunction
against Local 377 any further, in view of the fact that Local
377 pulled back the picketers from the Sandhill Road entr
ance.
The proposed injunction, prompted by a protest filed by
the University, would have charged that the picket lines
constituted a secondary boycott and were thus illegal.
Secondary boycotts are aimed at organizations that deal
with objectionable groups; primary boycotts are directed at
the objectionable group itself.
According to Halligan, the purpose of the picketing was
to put pressure on M&H and the University to stop using
Solano on the SLAC construction project because Solano
uses nonunion labor.
Local 377 officials refused comment on any of yesterday's
events and on plans for the near future.

Picketing at SLAC
One of several pickets representing the ironworkers union stands outside
the Alpine Road gate to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The pickets
hold signs claiming that the Solano County Construction Co., a subcontrac
tor on the SLAC expansion project, is "unfair to organized labor." The picket
line came down yesterday.
