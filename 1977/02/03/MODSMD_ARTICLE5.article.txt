# Computer system blamed for losses

The registrar's office "is paying a
substantial penalty" for doing ad
ministrative student services comput
ing on a smaller, slower computer in
stead of using the main campus facil
ity, said Mike Roberts, deputy director
of the Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP).
The office is currently using an IBM
370/135, whose production costs are
"anywhere from a third to a half more
expensive," than the University's
chief machine, an IBM 370/168, said
Roberts.
However, Bill Bartosh, programmer
analyst for the registrar, said it is "not
clear" the registrar would save money
by moving to the main machine be
cause of software (programming) in
compatibilities and scheduling prob
lems.
Last spring, SCIP and the registrar
attempted to transfer student services
computing from a medium-sized ad
ministrative machine, an IBM 370/145,
to the main campus facility as part of a
broad consolidation plan.
Poorly designed
However, planners soon realized
that the transfer package Was poorly
designed and tasks on the main com
puter were completed too slowly, said
Roberts. Meanwhile, SCIP had com
mitted the computer previously doing
thestudent services work (the37o/145)
for sale.
SCI1 1 then rented an IBM 370/135 at a
cost of $11,716 per month to continue
administrative processing and the at
tempted transfer was scrapped. The
370/135 is slower than either the 3701
145 or the main computer.
SCIP recently purchased a used
370/135 for $291,000 to replace the
rental machine now in use.
Jon Sandelin, manager of account
ing and financial services for SCIP, es
timated that the switch from rental to
purchase will yield approximately
$4500 per month in direct savings. The
switch will take place Feb. 9.
Attempted transfer
When the attempted transfer from
the 370/145 to the main computer
failed, the registrar's office rejected an
offer by Prof. Patrick Suppes of the In
stitute for Mathematical Studies in the

Social Sciences (IMSSS) to build a
student services system from"the
ground up" while sharing the IMSSS
machine, claimed Bartosh.
Although the proposal "never got to
the level of details," Suppes proposed
to start with the "elements of data" and
build a programming structure best
suited to the data as well as needs of
the registrar, Bartosh said.
The IMSSS staff proposed to com
plete its work in eight months. Bartosh
found it "a little hard to believe" the
IMSSS staff could have fulfilled its
predictions.
By attempting a transfer for a few
days from the old 370/145 to the main
computer facility, SCIP planners
simultaneously made major equip
ment and program modifications.
Roberts and Bartosh agreed that not
enough preparation or analysis ol
costs had been done before the en
deavor.
SPIRES/ORVYL
Student services computing on the
370/135 is done through a software
(program) package labeled OASIS
while the main 370/168 supports a
similar program package called
SPIRES/ORVYL. SPIRES/ORVYL and
OASIS are "file management systems"
which enable administrative users to
handle large amounts of data very flex
ibly.
Because of the similarity of the sys
tems, SCIP programmers predicted
that transfer of student services work
to the main machine would save
money, said Bartosh.
However, soon after SCIP made the
transfer, planners realized that the
main machine could not efficiently
handle the addition of the OASIS pac
kage.
OASIS did function on the 370/168,
but the time required to execute a
command (response time) was too
long because of the demand on the sys
tem in peak hours.
Cope with workload
Roberts said the 370/168 could cope
with the student services workload
through a more efficient program pac
kage than OASIS.
The student services workload
would only total 2-3 per cent of the
