# Decision expected in March
## Will Jordan co-op survive? 
### George Anders 
Will Jordan co-op go the way of the
Indian mascot, the Architecture De
partment and Jack Christiansen?
A decision on whether to keep Jor
dan will probably be reached by the
middle of March, according to Tim
Ferguson, chairperson of the Com
'mittee on Services to Students' Sub
committee on Residences (COSS/R).
Ferguson, speaking for COSS/R,
and Row Director Karen Murray both
stressed that they will evaluate all
special priority houses, not just Jor
dan.
COSS/R and Murray will make re
commendations to Norm Robinson,
acting associate dean of student af
fairs, who will decide if any changes
are needed among special priority
houses, Ferguson said.
However, Jordan "has to be classed
as one of the houses in trouble," Fer
guson said.
First choice
Six spaces in Jordan are presently
empty, according to Jordan House
Associate (RA) Lisa Dwyer. Last
spring, only 17 persons listed Jordan
as their first choice on round one of
the housing draw, although 3 5
spaces were open.
Most present vacancies stem from
individual circumstances unrelated
to the desirability of living in Jordan,
Dwyer said. But she agreed Jordan
was one of the least requested resi
dences in last year's draw.
Murray speculated that "Jordan's
reputation of old is a little late in get
ting erased."
"I guess people think everybody
here is into drugs," said Anne Bil
lingsley, a Jordan resident.
'Drug image'
Ferguson also referred to a "drug
image problem" and said images lag
behind reality. Billingsley added that
while Jordan may have had drug
related problems several years ago,
there is no tension between drug
users and nonusers now.
Tensions may be rising over the
condition of the house. "The Univer
sity is being really lax abojjt main
taining the house," Jordan house
manager John Laßouff, a senior,
charged. He said house plumbing is
in poor condition, floors are tilted
and the exterior needs repainting.
Murray said though, that "Jordan
is in no worse shape than some of the
other houses." She said she is
prioritizing a list of renovations

needed by row houses.
Generally, co-op living may not be
as popular as it once was, Murray
said. "Co-ops at Stanford now do not
have quite the counterculture ethos
that they used to have," she
explained.
Cleaning, cooking
"Students may be less willing to do
upkeep work," Ferguson said. (C-op
residents do their own cleaning and
cooking, unlike persons in most
other residences.) "This may have to
do with increased study pressures,"
he added.
Whatever the reasons for Jordan's
difficulties, Murray and COSS/R are
preparing to issue comprehensive
housing recommendations that will
cover Jordan.
Murray said she has received
house evaluations from RAs, includ

ing Dwyer, and regards these as the
beginning of her full-scale evalua
tion.
Ferguson said COSS/R will meet
Feb. 11 and hopefully complete its
recommendations at that meeting.
He said doing away with one co-op
was one of many possible recom
mendations COSS/R could make.
At that time, Ferguson said, prop
osals for new theme houses will have
been decided on. Should one or both
of the German Studies and An
drogyny House proposals be ap
proved, COSS/R would have to re
commend a location for the new
house or houses.
Until COSS/R and Murray issue re
ports, and until Robinson acts upon
them, Jordan's future is anyone's
guess.

individual circumstances unrelated
to the desirability of living in Jordan,
Dwyer said. But she agreed Jordan
was one of the least requested resi
dences in last year's draw.
Murray speculated that "Jordan's
reputation of old is a little late in get
ting erased."
"I guess people think everybody
here is into drugs," said Anne Bil
lingsley, a Jordan resident.
'Drug image'
Ferguson also referred to a "drug
image problem" and said images lag
behind reality. Billingsley added that
while Jordan may have had drug
related problems several years ago,
there is no tension between drug
users and nonusers now.
Tensions may be rising over the
condition of the house. "The Univer
sity is being really lax abojjt main
taining the house," Jordan house
manager John Laßouff, a senior,
charged. He said house plumbing is
in poor condition, floors are tilted
and the exterior needs repainting.
Murray said though, that "Jordan
is in no worse shape than some of the
other houses." She said she is
prioritizing a list of renovations

needed by row houses.
Generally, co-op living may not be
as popular as it once was, Murray
said. "Co-ops at Stanford now do not
have quite the counterculture ethos
that they used to have," she
explained.
Cleaning, cooking
"Students may be less willing to do
upkeep work," Ferguson said. (C-op
residents do their own cleaning and
cooking, unlike persons in most
other residences.) "This may have to
do with increased study pressures,"
he added.
Whatever the reasons for Jordan's
difficulties, Murray and COSS/R are
preparing to issue comprehensive
housing recommendations that will
cover Jordan.
Murray said she has received
house evaluations from RAs, includ

ing Dwyer, and regards these as the
beginning of her full-scale evalua
tion.
Ferguson said COSS/R will meet
Feb. 11 and hopefully complete its
recommendations at that meeting.
He said doing away with one co-op
was one of many possible recom
mendations COSS/R could make.
At that time, Ferguson said, prop
osals for new theme houses will have
been decided on. Should one or both
of the German Studies and An
drogyny House proposals be ap
proved, COSS/R would have to re
commend a location for the new
house or houses.
Until COSS/R and Murray issue re
ports, and until Robinson acts upon
them, Jordan's future is anyone's
guess.

Visitors to Jordan House, at 620 Mayfield Ave., are greeted by this open
mouth. Behind the door is a co-op with an uncertain future.
Will Jordan co-op go the way of the
Indian mascot, the Architecture De
partment and Jack Christiansen?
A decision on whether to keep Jor
dan will probably be reached by the
middle of March, according to Tim
Ferguson, chairperson of the Com
'mittee on Services to Students' Sub
committee on Residences (COSS/R).
Ferguson, speaking for COSS/R,
and Row Director Karen Murray both
stressed that they will evaluate all
special priority houses, not just Jor
dan.
COSS/R and Murray will make re
commendations to Norm Robinson,
acting associate dean of student af
fairs, who will decide if any changes
are needed among special priority
houses, Ferguson said.
However, Jordan "has to be classed
as one of the houses in trouble," Fer
guson said.
First choice
Six spaces in Jordan are presently
empty, according to Jordan House
Associate (RA) Lisa Dwyer. Last
spring, only 17 persons listed Jordan
as their first choice on round one of
the housing draw, although 3 5
spaces were open.
Most present vacancies stem from
individual circumstances unrelated
to the desirability of living in Jordan,
Dwyer said. But she agreed Jordan
was one of the least requested resi
dences in last year's draw.
Murray speculated that "Jordan's
reputation of old is a little late in get
