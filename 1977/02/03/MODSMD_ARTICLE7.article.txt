## An encounter in time

Paul Bauman

Everything is changing so quickly
these days . . . customs, attitudes,
tastes, and so on. Watches are a perfect
tangible example. They're not even
called watches anymore; they're
chronometers, chronographs, or
timepieces. Ask today's 7-year
old what a watch is and he or she will
probably say it's what cave men used
to tell time.
Advances are occurring so rapidly
in this industry that it's almost impos
sible to keep up with them. I disco
vered that the other day when I went to
the jeweler's to buy a watch — excuse
me — timepiece.
"I'm interested in looking at a few,
uh, timepieces," I told the man behind
the counter.
"I see," sipping a cup of coffee, he
said, "and how much did you want to
spend?"
"Oh, about $75."
The salesman nearly gagged on his
drink. "There's a novelty shop around
the corner. Maybe you can pick up a
Mickey Mouse watch there for that
kind of money. This establishment is
for grown-ups."
"I'm sorry," I said. "I haven't been in
the market for a watch — I mean
timepiece — in quite a while. I guess
things have changed."
"I understand," the salesman said
earnestly. "Here, let me show you our
biggest seller. It's called the Astro 111.
It's fully computerized and gives you a
digital read-out. But, of course, that's
only the beginning. It also has a stop

watch, a calendar up to the year 3000,
an electronic calculator with 34 func
tions, and a metric conversion table.''
"That's very impressive," I said,
"but can it give me the time right
here?"
"You bet it can," the salesman said
jubilantly. "The Astro 111 is guaranteed
to be correct within one second a year.
1 don't have to tell you that this is the
timepiece the Bell telephone lady goes
by to announce the time.
"But the Astro 111 is for people only
casually interested in the time," he
continued. "Perhaps you need some
thing more precise. In that case, I d
recommend our Apollo IX model,
which is endorsed by Nobel Prize
winning scientists around the world."
"No, that's OK," I said. "I kind of
like that Astro whatever. Do you have
to wind it?"
"Wind it?" the salesman responded
incredulously. "What for?"
"To keep it running."
"Certainly not," the salesman said.
"This timepiece operates on solar
energy."
"I might have guessed," I said.
"What about durability? The Astro
whatever looks like it might be a little
on the fragile side."
"No problem," the salesman
answered proudly. "In a test situation,
one of our lab men took a rifle and fired
a M-16 slug right through it. Darned if
the little devil didn't keep right on
humming."
"By the way," he added, "what's

that thing strapped to your wrist?"
"That's my watch," I said, handing
it over.
"What are these long, skinny
things?" the salesman asked, pointing
at the face.
"You mean the hands?"
"Yeah, I guess. What are they for?"
"If you look at the numbers the dials
point to, you can tell what time it is," I
explained. "No kidding?" the sales
man said.
"Listen," I countered rather hur
riedly, "how much does that Astro
whatever cost?"
"The Astro III? I think you'll find it a
bargain at $995.99."
Utterly dumbfounded, I told the
salesman that I'd better be moving on.
"Are you sure I couldn't interest you
in our new Global XVII model?" he
asked. "With the flick of a switch, it
can analyze soil samples."
"No thanks. I think I'll stick with my
own watch."
"Okay," the salesman said, shrug
ging his shoulders. "If you can make
any sense out of those dials, more
power to you."
