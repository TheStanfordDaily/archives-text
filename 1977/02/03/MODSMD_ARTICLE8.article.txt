Recycling program
The article "New Recycling Prog
ram Set" (Daily, Jan. 27 ) contains sev
eral inaccurate and misleading state
ments on the current status of recycl
ing on campus.
First of all, the "new" program is a
result of SWOPSI initiative. Last
summer Jeff Norment and I were ap
proached by Tom Graham, SWOPSI
student co-director, with an idea of
teaching a course on recycling and to
eventually develop a recycling plan at
Stanford. The volunteer group SWERP
was formed only a few weeks ago as a
way to get additional clerical help
from the ASSU Office of Student Ser
vices.
Second, the program has been
evolving for several months. The arti
cle does not mention SWOPSI 172 A,
-given in the autumn quarter. The work
*done by the students for that course
' was groundwork for the activities this
•« quarter. Students conducted research
in three areas: determination of quan
tities and composition of the Universi
< ty's refuse; developing a list of poten
tial buyers or other outlets for recycled
« material; and a survey of students, fa
-1 culty and staff to solicit ideas for
specific recycling programs and
policies.
The eventual goal of this SWOPSI
class (not of SWERP) is to formulate a
recycling plan for the campus. The
plan will consist of a series of prog
rams designed to (a) expand the efforts
of Alpha Place, the group currently
conducting a recycling program on
campus, and (b) reduce the quantity of
waste generated in University offices,
food services, and living units.

Finally, theSWOPSI class is being
taught by Norment, a student at San
Jose State University — not Santa Cruz
University — and myself. I am a civil
engineer at Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., con
sulting engineers. The course sponsor
is Prof. James Leckie of the Civil En
gineering Department.

Senate proposal
In light of this week's Faculty Senate
meeting on the future of foreign lan
guage programs here, we think it
proper to review the points of our re
solution on the matter, which the
ASSU Senate passed 17-1 some three
weeks ago.
First, we commend the caution
shown in Prof. Alphonse Juilland's
proposal to initiate a study of the lan
guage program. Haste should be av
oided in making changes in academic
offerings and requirements which
might have an adverse effect upon stu
dents.
Second, as the proposal encourages
input into the matter from "competent
constituencies," we insist that stu
dents be so included, both as members
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and as part of anan hoc group
studying the matter at hand.
Finally, we again ask the Faculty
Senate to reverse its hasty adoption of
requirements in Western culture, and
to use the foreign language proposal as
a model for its actions visa vis Western
culture as well.
