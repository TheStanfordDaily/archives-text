# Decision upheld: 1971 'Daily' raid illegal
## A
						landmark decision for freedom of press 
### John Freed 
A 1971 search of the Daily offices by
four Palo Alto policemen was uncon
stitutional, the U.S. Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday.
The landmark decision, based on
police violations of the First and
Fourth Amendments, has implications
for all citizens, not just press organiza
tions, according to Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam, an attorney for the Daily.
The three-judge panel unanimously
affirmed the 1972 decision of federal
Judge Robert Peckham. In that deci
sion, Peckham said that police should
use the "least drastic means" available
when seeking evidence fron non
suspects.
In this case, police used a search
warrant, which gave the Daily no ad
vance warning, rather than the less
drastic means of a subpoena, which
the Daily could have attempted to
quash.
"This is a very important victory,"
Amsterdam said yesterday. The deci
sion "respects the rights of individu
als," he added.
Binding precedent
Known as Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher, the decision sets a binding
precedent upon federal district courts
of the Ninth Circuit, which includes
much of the Western United States, ac
cording to Political Science Prof.
Robert Horn. Federal courts in the rest
of the country will probably look to it

as a precedent, he added, but the deci
sion is not binding throughout the na
tion unless decided by the Supreme
Court.
Jerome Falk Jr., who argued the Dai
ly's case before the Court of Appeals,
said the court ruled in favor of the
Daily on every legal question raised.
"I'm just pleased as can be," Falk
said.
The court reinstated the award of
$47,500 made by Peckham for attor
neys' fees. After the original award had
been made by Peckham, it was invali
dated by a 1974 Supreme Court deci
sion, according to Falk.
Late last year, however, Congress
approv'd a bill, later signed by Presi
dent Cerald Ford, reinstating fees in
cases such as the Daily's.
No pay
The Daily's attorneys have been
working without pay for most of the
six-year course of the litigation.
Marilyn Taketa, the assistant Palo
Alto city attorney who argued the
police case before the Court of Ap
pears, said no decision had yet been
reached on whether the city would ap
peal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"If that decision is reached, it will be
announced," Taketa said. "First we
have to decide whether to petition for a
rehearing by the Ninth Circuit Court
(of Appeals)."
The city has until Feb. 16 to petition
for rehearing and 60 days to file an
appeal with the Supreme Court.
The lawsuit stemmed from a raid by
Palo Alto police of the Daily offices on
April 12, 1971. Armed with a search
warrant, police ransacked files, desks
and wastebaskets looking for photo
graphic evidence to use against par
ticipants in an April 9, 1971 riot at
Stanford Hospital.
Injuries at sit-in
At least 37 persons were injured,
and 23 demonstrators were arrested,
when police ended a sit-in protesting
the firing of hospital worker Sam
Bridges.
It was the first known time in U.S.
history that police had used a warrant
to search a news organization for evi
dence, according to Falk.
Since that time, Berkeley radio sta
tion KPFA-FM, Los Angeles station
KPFK.-FM and San Francisco station
KPOO have faced similar situations. A

search has also occured at the Los
Angeles Star, and at least two search
warrants have been issued against the
Berkeley Barb.
The brief, five-page appellate deci
sion was issued per curiam, meaning
the decision was unsigned but unani
mous. It adopted in full the decision of
Peckham, ruling the search uncon
stitutional on Fourth Amendment
grounds which prohibit "unreasona
ble searches and seizures," and further
holding t hat law enforcement agencies
should be particularly cautious "when
First Amendment interests are in
volved."
Peckham's ruling indicated that a
search warrant, rather than a sub
poena, "should be permitted only in
the rare circumstance where there is a
clear showing that 1) important mate
rials will be destroyed or removed
from the jurisdiction; and 2) a restrain
ing order would be futile."
"To stop short of this standard
would be to sneer at all the First
Amendment has come to represent in
our society," Peckham concluded.
The appeals court also rejected two
claims made by the city of Palo Alto
after Peckham's original decision had
been issued. One argument was that
the magistrate who issued the original
search warrant, J. Barton Phelps, was
theonly proper defendant, and thatthe
Daily had improperly sued law en
forcement personnel.

Hi, mom
Law enforcement officials searched the Daly office on April 12, 1971
seeking evidence for use against participants in a riot. In 1972 the search
was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld that ruling Wednesday, setting a binding precedent upon
federal district Ninth Circuit courts.
