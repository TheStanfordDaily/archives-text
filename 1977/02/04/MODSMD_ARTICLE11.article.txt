# Abolish death penalty
## 
### 
As Gary Gilmore's ashes settle in the
Utah Valley the entire question of capi
tal punishment is being reviewed in
the minds of many Americans. I feel
that if they become acquainted with all
the evidence they will conclude that
the death penalty is morally reprehen
sible and should be abolished.
Capital punishment is cruel and un
usual. This depends, of course, on
one's definition of "cruel and un
usual." To the average American child
who sees 15,000 murders on television
by the time he reaches adolescence, I
suppose the destruction of human life
is not so uncommon.
But what of cruelty? In a society that
tolerates the trampling of farm work
ers' rights and the clubbing to death of
baby seals for fur coats, perhaps sen
sitivity for the lives of unattractive
criminals is not to be expected. While
public opinion may sanction immoral
punishments, it can never justify
them. In fact, such lax morality often
breeds more crime.
We've heard this social symptom ar
gument before, reply the death penalty
proponents. And they are also quick to
point out that America's founding
fathers who drafted the "cruel and un
usual" constitutional phrase tolerated
the death penalty. These people seem
to forget, however, tbat George
Washington was also a slaveholder.
And, they certainly don't suggest that
slavery is not a cruel and unusual
anachronism.
Capital punishment denies due pro
cess of law. After someone is put to
death, the surfacing of new evidence
that vindicates him or the passage of a
new law which would have served to
overturn his conviction does no good
but perhaps to soothe a mother's mem
ory. And due process is a constitu
tional right.
Random application
The death penalty is applied ran
domly at best and discriminatorily at
worst. It is imposed almost exclusively
against blacks, Chicanos.the poor, the
uneducated persons who are victims
of overt discrimination in the sentenc
ing process or who are unable to afford
expert and dedicated legal counsel.
The moral and constitutional de

fects in death penalty laws are not ap
preciably altered by shifting from
mandatory to discretionary sentenc
ing. Suppose, for instance, that the
death penalty was reserved for those
individuals who murdered policemen,
as many states have prescribed. Would
it be more acceptable for the murderer
to have slain a grocer?
Of course, such laws are put on the

books to protect the lives of those
people who enforce the law, but such
pragmatic considerations pull no
weight in the face of the absolute ethi
cal argument that one man's life is a
sacred as another's.
Classifying types of murders of dif
ferent individuals in respect to the
death penalty only underlines the ar
bitrary enforcement of the current
criminal procedure. In order to be
philosophically consistent, those in
favor of capital punishment must ad
vocate the execution not only for those
100 people a year sentenced to the
electric chair, but for each culpable
murderer responsible for the 20,000
homicides committed in this country
annually . Such
strict enforcement would certainly re
sult in the executions of hundreds of
innocent people.
Shelves of studies have been pro
duced that "conclusively" find that
the death penalty is and yet is not a
deterrent. In their last ruling on the
death penalty, the Supreme Court
found that those studies have, "simply
been inconclusive." Nevertheless, the
fact remains that states that have reins
tituted the death penalty after abolish
ing it have not shown a decreased rate
of criminal homicide.
Vacillating opinion
A democratic society can't necessar
ily judge moral questions by simple
majority rule. Case in point: a 1976
Gallup poll found that the death pen

alty was favored by Americans 65 to 28
per cent. Why not jack up the voltage
immediately? Because in 1966 a Gal
lup poll found that Americans op
posed the death penalty 47 to 42 per
cent.
Will any rational person maintain
that the death penalty was right in
1789, wrong in 1966 and right again in
1977? Did the sun revolve around the
earth until 51 per cent of the world's
inhabitants believed that nature oper
ated the other way around?
No one denies that capital punish
ment is a moral question. Morals must
be philosophically consistent. Ap
proval of the death penalty under
those criteria would set this country's
legal system back to the middle ages,
or at least to justice as meted out in
several Arab countries. In Iran, steal
ing is punished by cutting off a thief's
hand, and in Saudi Arabia they still
chop people's heads off (although this
is much less painful than the death
Gilmore suffered, living a full two mi
nutes with four bullets in his heart).
Barbarian
Perhaps we have already slipped
back on the barbaric path. According
to Dr. Bernard Diamond of the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley, "We've
got too long a tradition of justice being
revenge or retaliation to see that
change. The great bulk of the public
don't really have any interest in deter
ring murder. They're crying for
blood."
So what do we do with these mur
derers if we don't gas, hang, shoot or
fry them? Put them back on the streets?
No, society should attempt to re
habilitate them. And if rehabilitation
fails as it has in the past, then keep the
murderer behind bars, for in prison he
still has a better chance of stabilizing
over a period of time than in the ghetto
or in a grave.
In Gilmore's firing squad there were
five guns but only four bullets, the
theory being that each of the shooters
could feel he did not kill a man. The
beauty of such a procedure is that no
one feels guilty, not the firing squad,
not the judge, not the jury.
Everyone's conscience being clear,
the executioners must have been at
quite a loss to explain the presence of
the corpse.
