Stanford mokes much of its
tradition of not giving athletes
more privileges than everyone
else. Yet, now that Nautilus
equipment has been installed in
the Encina gym weight room, the
Nautilus area is closed off to
regular students while a group of
"advanced weight training"
students get free run of the ex
pensive machines virtually all
afternoon.
I don't know how one gets in
"advanced weight training" but
the privileged few appear to be
all athletes (some of whom are
football players who have com
pleted their last season at Stan
ford).
Now, if the Nautilus machines
were purchased out of football
revenues, I can tolerate this, but
if they were bought out of gen
eral fund revenues, well, as they
say, !&?)

Well, rumor has it that you've
got a legitimate gripe. But before
you send away for your very own
Jack LaLanne body builder, read
on; cuz the situation's not as
dismal as it sounds.
Getting down to basics, lemme
first explain what the Nautilus
is. Chairman of Physical Educa
tion and Recreation Wesley Ruff
calls it a "variable resistance
machine" and, if you haven't
guessed it already, the exer
ciser's main intent is to improve

strength.
Apparently, the football
coaches were able to solicit
funds from two private donors to
buy the machine. And, as a little
birdie told me, that could be the
reason why the coaches may feel
the football team has priority
over everyone else.
As for the "advanced weight
training" bit, it's a class for
non-bt;ginners that uses the
Nautilus exclusively on Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday
from 4-6 p.m. Any other time is
open to "all comers" — men and
women alike. And if you want to
keep up a thrice-weekly
schedule, remember the weight
room is open from 10 a.m. to
noon on Saturdays, too.
When is the bookstore slated
/or completion? If it's as longas I
think, why?-J.W.
"Good question," says Gen
eral Manager Eldon Speed, who
says the annex is slated for com
pletion in the spring of '78.
The first phase of the construc
tion — the excavation and the
underpinning of the building —
was finished at the end of De
cember. Speed estimated the
cost at around $150,000.
The second phase, which is
the actual construction of the
building, should go to bid some
time this month. Speed main
tains the bookstore will know
who's going to do the job by the

end of this month.
So, comparatively speaking
(take the new engineering build
ing, for instance) it shouldn't be
too long before that pit behind
the store will be transformed
into shelves full of books,
T-shirts, paper, and junk food.
