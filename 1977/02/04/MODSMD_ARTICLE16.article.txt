# First, natural gas...
## Now a uranium shortage predicted 
### 
From the Associated Press
The uranium industry is warn
ing, as the natural gas industry
did in years gone by, that its re
serves fall far short of the re
quirements being scheduled for
it by energy authorities.
As a result, at least one
uranium producer, the Atlas
Corp., is urging a crash program
of exploration and development,
financed in part by huge gov
ernment loans, additional tax
credits and depletion allo
wances.
Edward Farley Jr., Atlas presi
dent, said an investment of at
least $18 billion will be needed
to meet the nation's uranium
needs during the next 25 years,
for exploration, new mines and
additional processing plants.
"The uranium industry is in
no position to supply that kind
of capital," he said.
Atlas was one of the first U.S.
companies to enter the uranium
mining business more than two
decades ago, and now has con
tracts to supply yellow-cake to a
number of the 55 nuclear power
plants in the United States.
He said the inability of his and
other companies to meet re
quirements could result in seri
ous social and economic disloca
tions, possibly resulting in
power shortages, higher electric
ity bills and slowed economic
growth.
Under his plan, the federal

government would put up a
large part of the $1H billion he
feels is needed.
"Companies, individuals,
partnerships, whatever they he,
would have to prove that on a
property there was a reasonable
prospect of a commercial ore
body" before obtaining funds, he
said.
If the explorers discover
uranium they would be required
to repay the loans, but if their
efforts resulted in failure the
loans would be forgiven.

The federal government has
been conducting an airplane
survey over a 700,000-square
milearea ofthecountry insearch
of deposits. The information is
fed into computers to pinpoint
possible exploration sites for
private industry.
Most uranium deposits pre
sently are situated in the western
part of the country, but known
deposits exist in Tennessee and
North Carolina, and a recent
government survey suggests
there maybe ore in Pennsylvania

and Maine.
Current, somewhat vague
plans call for nuclear energy to
provide about 15 per cent of the
nation's electricity by 1985,
about double the c urrent level,
with the percentage rising to 50
per cent or so by the year 2000.
Farley maintains the uranium
reserves simply do not exist to
meet that schedule, and that "the
annual gap between our produc
tion of uranium and our needs is
growing every year."


The good old days
Way back in 1971, there was water in Lake Lagunita, natural gas in every pipeline and uranium in
every reactor.
