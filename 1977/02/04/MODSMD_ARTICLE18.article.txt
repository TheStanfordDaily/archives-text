# Lox of bagels at Works
## 
### Laura Ost 
In a crowded one-room shop just a mile from
campus, New York City, Philadelphia and Palo
Alto customers meet to make a classic Sunday
brunch.
The Bagel Works takes bagel making seri
ously enough to import a special blend of malt
from Brooklyn to make their chewy, doughnut
shaped rolls. Customers can then buy them
spread with a special whipped cream cheese
shipped from Philadelphia.
Twelve to fifteen hundred bagels are mixed,
baked and sold at the Bagel Works every day,
estimates Stuart Stone, one of the proprietors.
He and his brother Lionel and 10 employes sup
ply bagels for both a busy front counter and a
wholesale business that extends from Reno to
Monterey.
Open three years
A steady stream of customers visit the Works.
Stuart Stone observes that both young and old
patronize his store, and that sales have improved
continually since the store opened more than
three years ago, "although we feel like people
don't really know we're here yet."
The Works' "simple" (and secret) recipe,
which combines flour, salt, malt and yeast, is
concocted in a mixer dated 1912, which can
hold up to 700 lbs. of ingredients.
The dough is formed into three ounce mounds
which "rest" for 10 minutes on a conveyer that
looks like a multi-rowed ferris wheels A bagel
making machine then squeezes the mounds into
rings, and the rolls are left to rise for an hour or
two.
The rest of the process takes place in full view

of the customer. The bagels are boiled in water
lor one minute "to get the excess starch out.
"That's why they're low in calories," claims
Stuart Stone. "And they're made with high glu
ten (low starch) flour to begin with. Our bagel
has 110 calories."
After boiling, the bagels are sprinkled with
such toppings as onion bits and sesame seeds,
and the bagels are baked for 12-15 minutes.
Fresh from the oven, the bagels are tossed into
baskets at the counter, where customers can
choose from six varieties: plain, onion, poppy or
sesame seed, garlic and rye-pumpernickle.
Bagels cost 15 cents each, or for a little more,
they can be purchased with lox or the aforemen
tioned cream cheese.
Bialys too
The Works also makes bialys, floury, onion
flavored rolls with a thumbprint in the center
instead of a hole.
Lioilel Stone says that the bagel has a long
history.
"The story 1 have is that it originated some
where around the 1400s or 1500s in Austria.
Seems that the King came to this town in Austria
to some equestrian event. They made bread in
the shape of a stirrup to celebrate, and then
people liked it so well it went all over Europe.
Eventually they closed the stirrup and made it a
circle."
How do their modem-version bagels taste?
They just taste "like bagels," said one Bagel
Works customer with a shrug. "But they're fresh
here."
The Bagel Works, at 129 Lytton Ave., Palo
Alto, is open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays and
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends.

and the bagels are baked for 12-15 minutes.
Fresh from the oven, the bagels are tossed into
baskets at the counter, where customers can
choose from six varieties: plain, onion, poppy or
sesame seed, garlic and rye-pumpernickle.
Bagels cost 15 cents each, or for a little more,
they can be purchased with lox or the aforemen
tioned cream cheese.
Bialys too
The Works also makes bialys, floury, onion
flavored rolls with a thumbprint in the center
instead of a hole.
Lioilel Stone says that the bagel has a long
history.
"The story 1 have is that it originated some
where around the 1400s or 1500s in Austria.
Seems that the King came to this town in Austria
to some equestrian event. They made bread in
the shape of a stirrup to celebrate, and then
people liked it so well it went all over Europe.
Eventually they closed the stirrup and made it a
circle."
How do their modem-version bagels taste?
They just taste "like bagels," said one Bagel
Works customer with a shrug. "But they're fresh
here."
The Bagel Works, at 129 Lytton Ave., Palo
Alto, is open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays and
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends.

Rings of raw dough plop out of a bagel making machine.
In a crowded one-room shop just a mile from
campus, New York City, Philadelphia and Palo
Alto customers meet to make a classic Sunday
brunch.
The Bagel Works takes bagel making seri
ously enough to import a special blend of malt
from Brooklyn to make their chewy, doughnut
shaped rolls. Customers can then buy them
spread with a special whipped cream cheese
shipped from Philadelphia.
Twelve to fifteen hundred bagels are mixed,
baked and sold at the Bagel Works every day,
estimates Stuart Stone, one of the proprietors.
He and his brother Lionel and 10 employes sup
ply bagels for both a busy front counter and a
wholesale business that extends from Reno to
Monterey.
Open three years
A steady stream of customers visit the Works.
Stuart Stone observes that both young and old
patronize his store, and that sales have improved
continually since the store opened more than
three years ago, "although we feel like people
don't really know we're here yet."
The Works' "simple" (and secret) recipe,
which combines flour, salt, malt and yeast, is
concocted in a mixer dated 1912, which can
hold up to 700 lbs. of ingredients.
The dough is formed into three ounce mounds
which "rest" for 10 minutes on a conveyer that
looks like a multi-rowed ferris wheels A bagel
making machine then squeezes the mounds into
rings, and the rolls are left to rise for an hour or
two.
The rest of the process takes place in full view

of the customer. The bagels are boiled in water
lor one minute "to get the excess starch out.
"That's why they're low in calories," claims
Stuart Stone. "And they're made with high glu
ten (low starch) flour to begin with. Our bagel
has 110 calories."
After boiling, the bagels are sprinkled with
such toppings as onion bits and sesame seeds,
and the bagels are baked for 12-15 minutes.
