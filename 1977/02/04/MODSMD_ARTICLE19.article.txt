# People's Teahouse cure for munchies
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Got the munchies and ham
burgers just won't do?
Why not try a steaming hot
char siu bao instead? Or siu mai?
They are available at the
People's Teahouse next to the
Madera Lounge in Wilbur Hall.
A char siu bao is a steamed
bun filled with barbecued pork.
The less doughy offering has
been a staple at the Teahouse
■ ever since it opened here. Sui
* mai, another popular item, are
> pork-filled dumplings.
5 The Teahouse offers an alter
' native to Tresidder and the fast
* food joints on El Camino. It has
. cozy surroundings and the ser
* vice is efficient.
'So regular'
"People like to come here be
' cause we're so regular — we're

open every night from 9 to
12," said co-manager Joan
Trusty. Trusty, along with four
other volunteer student mana
gers, helps insure that the
Teahouse will continue serving
other Asian delicacies such as
ramen (noodles and broth), arare
(rice crackers) and nine types of
tea.
The Teahouse was originally
part of the Junipero (Asian
American Theme House) cul
tural activities proposal pre
sented three years ago. It is man
ned hy about 38 student volun
teers throughout the week.
"Fridays and Saturdays are
our slowest days," said Ron
Nakao, co-manager. "Monday
nights are our busiest. 1 guess it's
because people say, 'Heck with
it, it's still early in the week. I can

take a break from studying and
have a bao.' "
Asian atmosphere
Most of the Teahouse's
wooden chairs and spool tables
were donated by the University
and other outside organizations,
said Trusty. And for those who
really want to get into the Asian
atmosphere, there are low tables
and cushions for sitting on the
floor.
All the food is bought in San
Francisco's Chinatown. How
ever, student prices are still rela
tively inexpensive — 25 cents
for a bao, 20 cents for siu mai and
35 cents for ramen. Almond
cookies are three for a quarter.
Once every two and a half
weeks, co-managers Meika
Fang, Laurie Fan or Curt Lee,
go to Chinatown to buy ap

proximately 1700-1800 bao, ac
cording to Nakao.
"The food service has also
been really good about letting us
use some of their freezer space
for siu mai and bao," said Trusty.
Good take
Nakao estimated that the
Teahouse takes in about $400-
500 each week. Half of the
money must be used, according
to Teahouse policy, for support
ing Asian American activities
outside the University. Last year,
the Teahouse contributed $2350
projects including self-help for
elderly Asian Americans, an
Asian American women's jour
nal, the North Beach Family
Planning Center, the Wendy
Yoshimura Fair Trial Fund and a
bilingual handbook printed by
Chinese for Affirmative Action.

Efforts have been made to keep
the Teahouse looking pleasant.
Trusty supervised the installa
tion of a new red and white
lineoleum floor in the former
dormitory storeroom. Red cur
tains cover the windows, stereo
music wafts through the room
and colorful wall paintings de
picting Japanese playing cards
make the Teahouse a place
where students stay.
Nakao said one of the best
things about the Teahouse is the
freedom the managers enjoy in
directing Teahouse affairs.
"Every manager has the total
freedom to approach sales in any
way they want to." said Nakao.
"The freedom makes the work
we do seem more real. You are
responsible for making things
work or blowing it."

The People's Teahouse (near Madera in Wilbur Hall) has been
serving late-night oriental snacks for three years. Customers
can choose from such favorites as sui mai, arare, ramen and
char sui bao. Part of the Teahouse's proceeds are donated to
Asian American activities outside the University.
Got the munchies and ham
burgers just won't do?
Why not try a steaming hot
char siu bao instead? Or siu mai?
They are available at the
People's Teahouse next to the
Madera Lounge in Wilbur Hall.
A char siu bao is a steamed
bun filled with barbecued pork.

been a staple at the Teahouse

'So regular'
"People like to come here be
' cause we're so regular — we're

open every night from 9 to

Trusty. Trusty, along with four
other volunteer student mana
gers, helps insure that the
Teahouse will continue serving
other Asian delicacies such as
ramen (noodles and broth), arare
(rice crackers) and nine types of
tea.
The Teahouse was originally

"Fridays and Saturdays are

Nakao, co-manager. "Monday
nights are our busiest. 1 guess it's

Asian atmosphere
Most of the Teahouse's
wooden chairs and spool tables
were donated by the University
and other outside organizations,
said Trusty. And for those who
really want to get into the Asian
atmosphere, there are low tables
and cushions for sitting on the
floor.
