# Faculty Senate votes approval
## Language program study proposed 
### Bill Sing 
A proposal calling for an examina
tion of foreign languages in the under
graduate curriculum was approved by
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The proposal said that such an
examination would consider "ways in
which (foreign language study) might
be encouraged and strengthened."
The proposal directs the dean of
humanities and sciences, in consulta
tion with the dean of undergraduate
studies, the dean of the school of en
gineering, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies and "other compe

tent constituencies of the University"
to submit recommendations on foreign
language study before the end of the
calendar year 1977.
The proposal in no way directs the
University to adopt a foreign language
requirement, according to Prof. Al
phonse Juilland, chairman of the de
partment of French and Italian, who
submitted the proposal.
The senate's action comes in re
sponse to figures showing an abrupt
decline of enrollment in first year
foreign language courses from last
year, which seems due to the new

humanities distribution requirements
which exclude all first year foreign
language courses from fulfilling the
requirement. Such declines have
ranged from 43 per cent in beginning
Russian to 12 per cent in beginning
Spanish.
"There is something wrong with
curriculum in a major university when
you can use introductory courses in
any other field to satisfy graduation
requirements, and somehow single out
introductory foreign languages as
those that don't fulfill such require
ments," philosophy Prof. Julius
Moravcsik told the'senate.
Student Faculty Senate representa
tive John Richard said that he thought
the proposal is a "fair and correct way"
to approach the crisis in foreign lan
guage study. Richard expressed con
cern, however, that students be con
sulted as part of the "competent con
stituencies" referred to in the prop
osal.
The ASSU Senate had endorsed the
proposal in its meeting three vyeeks
ago by a vote of 17-1.
Assoc. English Prof. Nancy Packer
expressed opposition to the proposal.

saying that a study of the foreign lan
guage program is "too premature" be
cause the new distribution require
ments have been in effect only five*
months.
"There's really not enough of a data
base to warrant drastic action at this
time," said Packer.
A.ssoc. English Prof. William Chace
disagreed, saying that a study of
foreign language programs concurrent
with efforts to define the Western Cul
ture requirement is "quite approp
riate." Chace submitted the proposal
to institute a Western Culture re
quirement, approved by the senate last
December.
The Faculty Senate also approved
yesterday new policy guidelines for
faculty consulting submitted by the
Committee on Research. Among other
things, the new policy sets a limit on
consulting time to 13 days per quarter
for full-time faculty.
The committee defined consulting
as "professional activity related to the
person's field or discipline, where a
fee-for-service or equivalent relation
ship with a third party exists."
