# Mandarin food tasty, plentiful
## 
### Harry Killas 
Are you tired of ordering won ton
soup, sweet and sour pork and
standard Cantonese dishes each
time you want Chinese food? 1 hen
perhaps you haven't tried the hot
ter, spicier dishes of Northern
China.
Within minutes of the campus are
at least four restaurants serving
Szechuan and Hunan food. Three
are within biking distance. At all
these establishments, waiters are
willing to recommend dishes that
would complement each other
(such as the mild with the spicy to
serve your tongue). All still serve
your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the Man
darin cuisine of China. It is ex
tremely popular with Stanford
people (even Benny Goodman) be
cause it combines uncommonly
good service with some of the best
Chinese cooking in the area.
Chu's eggrolls ($1.30 for two), for
example, are packed with pork,
bean sprouts and bamboo shoots.
They are notable because the batter
is not greasy from the deep-fry. The
more adventurous should try the
five spice beef, a cold Mandarin ap
petizer with an intriguing taste.
One of the soups, hot and sour
($1.95) boasted crisp vegetables in a
thick broth with bean curd and just
enough vinegar.
One shouldn't miss the mu shu
pork which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is saved from the tortilla
like pancake found at most other
places.
Dry braised prawns were gener
ously served in an irresistable
tomato-cherry sauce with seal lions
and chopped onions. Hunan chic
ken ($4.50) consisted of morsels of
boneless chicken — quick-fried in
hot oil and spices with bamboo
shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen and

varied; one can't go wrong with any
of their "specialties." Although its
prices are no longer cheap, Chef
( tiu's is a lively and fun place to
dine, especially with a large group
of people.

Chef Chu's: lively and fun place

China Lton is the new venture of
Samson Chu, Lawrence "Chef"
<hu's younger brother. Once in
side, you are hidden from the buzz
of El Camino by the informal and
serene atmosphere. Ask for a table

China Lion: attentive service

that faces the beautiful outdoor
garden.
The menu lists 109 items, many
of which are Hunan-style. Prices are
lower than Chef Chu's, but the por
tions are smaller. One is advised to
order an extra bowl of rice. Service

China First: for an intimate dinner

was attentive and there were no
complaints.
China Lion's hot and sour soup
arrived piping hot, but badly
needed more pepper and vinegar. A
far more worthy starter was the
sizzling rice soup.

Hsi-Nan: try the shredded beef

Kung pao beef ($3.50 — spicy)
consisted of tender beef slices and
crisp green pepper accented with
peanuts, but was marred by a pool
of heavy oil at the bottom of the
dish. Prawns in hot sauce, although
tasty, was a challenge to eat — the
prawns were not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent chic-

ken. Juicy deep-fried chicken
pieces arrived in a slightly-sweet
garlic sauce with peppers. Other
successful offerings here are the
squid and shredded pork and the
tender beef and mushroom in oyster

sauce.
China Lion is a fine place to start
familiarizing oneself with the
cuisine of Hunan.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First, next to the Holiday Inn,

has low lighting and a civilized
mood. The menu is diverse and
competently served, and it includes
both standards such as sliced chic
ken and snow peas ($3.50), and
specialties like Hunan ham ($22),
which must be ordered in advance.

China First's soups make excel
lent starters. Its hot and sour is
spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham. shrimp and vegetables in
a rich chicken broth — was memor-

able.
Although listed asa specialty, the
Lake Tung Ting shrimp is a bland
melange of water chestnuts, mush
rooms and shrimp in egg. At
$4.95, the serving of shrimps was
not generous. Vegetables Hunan
style ($2.95) were limp from over
cooking and weighted down by a
thick sauce.

Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50), however, were treated with
respect. The scallops were not
tough from overcooking and con
trasted well with the accompanying
water chestnuts. The general's
chicken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunchy
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions at China
First are relatively generous, and
the prices compare with Chef
Chu's. China First is very close to
campus and makes a pleasant even
ing out for a date or visiting parents
who want something other than
steak and salad bar for dinner.
Have you ever wondered about
the Chinese kitchen hidden in the
Town and Country Village? Don't
pass up the Hsi-Nan. It serves some
of the best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is more
distinct and hotter than at the other
restaurants — "the way the dishes
should be prepared," says the
owner. Moreover, he will alter the
degree of hotness to suit the cus
tomer's taste.
It is commendable that dishes do
not arrive all at once at the Hsi-Nan,
Pot stickers ($1.95 for six), although
a little oily, were noodles contain
ing tasty ground pork and vegeta
bles. A large tureen of pork and
Chinese turnip soup up ($2.25) sub
tly blended bamboo shoots, mush
rooms, the turnip and pork.
Chicken in Peking sauce ($3.50)
was extremely tender and a must for
those who enjoy hot black bean
sauce. Szechuan shredded beef
($3.75) is a "knockout" dish, not
only for its plentiful serving, but
also for the chile peppers cooked in
it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices are
reasonable, the portions quite
generous, and the menu varied —
all of which make Hsi-Nan a good
buy in the Stanford area.
