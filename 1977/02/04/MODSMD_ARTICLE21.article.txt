## Baseball team opens season 
### Chris Kamel 
Baseball season is usually synonymous
with spring, green grass and a full Lake
Lagunita. Well, Lake Lag is as dry as a bone,
the green grass is covered with frost in the
morning and spring is still six weeks away,
but Stanford's baseball team opens its season
today.
The Cardinals host the University of San
Francisco Dons this afternoon at 2:30 and a
double-header tomorrow at noon at Sunken
Diamond.
First-year head coach Mark Marquess,
explained why the season is starting so early,
"I scheduled this many games before our
Pac-tt opener," said Marquess, referring to
the 34 pre-season games before USC on
March 24, "so that we can get a little experi
ence in working with each other."
34-games
Those 34 games ought to give Marquess a
little experience as head coach of the Cards,
too. Marquess, an assistant for five years
here, didn't learn until late August that he
would succeed Ray Young, head coach for
nine years.
"The transition (from assistant to head
coach) hasn't been that difficult," he said.
"The difficulties mainly come in the paper
work I had to do — schedules, eligibility,
and so on."
According to Marquess, the Cards have a
good nucleus to work with, but have to deal
without graduated short stop Steve Davis,
who held two single season and five career
Stanford records.
"Davis will be tough to replace," Mar

quess said. "He was a good player and an
excellent team leader."
Replacement
The Cards are counting on Dave Perez to
fill Davis' shoes. Perez, who played second
base last season before being sidelined with a
knee injury, is, according to Marquess, "an
outstanding player whom the other mem
bers respect."
The Cards, who have been working out for
a month now, are characterized by their
coach as a team that will get the most out of
what they have.
"They have put in a lot of good work,"
Marquess said. "Our main strength is our
speed. We should be able to steal a lot of
bases again this season."
Stanford set a school record last season
with 195 stolen bases.
'Great season'
Marquess admits, however, that pitching
and hitting will still determine the Cards'
fate. "We need to have a great season from a
couple of our pitchers as well as from four or
five hitters," ne said.
Stanford was hindered at the mound last
year with injuries to its pitching staff and
had to go with righthanders Brian Harrison,
Bruce Fiala and Mark Abbondola and lefth
ander Rob Irwin, all of whom were freshmen.
This year senior southpaws John Yandleand
Jerry Argust are healthy and should see
plenty of action.
"Our freshmen last year turned in out
standing performances," he said, "but we
definitely lacked the depth when we lost two
of our top pitchers in John Yandle and Jerry

August."
The infield also has regulars leturning in
sophomore Bruce Walters at catcher, junior
Tom Guardinoat first, junior Kevin Triggs at
second, Perez at short and senior Gary Pitch
ford at third.
The outfield looks just as strong as the
infield, with returnees PepeHinojosa in left
field, sophomore Larry Reynolds in center,
and sophomore Mike Codiroli in right. Mar
quess also picked up depth in Todd Ervin, a
transfer from Citrus Junior College, who will
see infield duty at second and short. The
next few weeks will help Marquess select the
top four or five pitchers as well as the best
hitters.

since 1972, to face Oregon tonight.
