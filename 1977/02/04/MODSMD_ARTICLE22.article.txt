## Cards resume Pac-8 play 
### Chris Baker 
When Stanford took a break
from Pacific-8 conference action
two weeks ago only one player,
forward Jay Carter, was out with
an injury.
But as the Cardinals resume
conference play with a pair of
games in Oregon this weekend,
Carter is still out and sophomore
guard Wolfe Perry and junior
center Jeff McHugh have also
been added to the injury list.
McHugh, who suffered an
ankle sprain in practice last
Wednesday, missed the Air
Force loss but came back to score
15 points and grab 11 rebounds
against Utah State.
"McHugh played with tre
mendous determination and
courage," said Card coach Dick
Dißiaso.
'Complete surprise'
"He was hurting badly. It was
a complete surprise to us that he
was able to play."
Carter, out since Jan. 6 with a
sprained ankle went just two
minutes against Utah State.
Perry, who suffered a sprained
ankle last Tuesday, was limited
to 10 minutes against Air Force
and five at Utah State.
McHugh is expected to be
back in the lineup this weekend

lard has taken up some of the
slack. Ballard, a 6-foot-7 senior,
is averaging 17.7 points and 9.3

rebounds per contest.

one of the best forwards on the
West Coast.' said Dißiaso.
"We'll have to contain him to be
successful tonight.

"Oregon is synonymous with
aggressive, high intensity de
fense and well disciplined of
fense. I would hope when we
play them we'll be the same type
of team."

travel to Corvallis to take on
Oregon State.

basketball games in which Lon

nie Shelton participated last

successful tonight.

aggressive, high intensity de

play them we'll be the same type
of team."
