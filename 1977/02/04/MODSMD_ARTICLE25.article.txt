# Pac-8 cage officials have it rough
## 
### David Georgette 
The two teams streak from one end of
the court to the other almost as fast as
the ball bounces up and down. The
white-jerseyed home town squad
moves out on a fast-break, and as the
star forward soars to the basket for a
lay-up, the red-clad visitor steps in his
way. The bodies fly — and the whistles
blow. The officials, the third team on
the floor, are now the center of atten
tion.
"Offensive, No. 42!" yells the
striped-shirted man as he crooks his
arm behind his head to signal the
scorer's table. Comments about the of
ficial's ancestry and eyesight cascade
from the stands.
For the official, "There's no way to
win," said Frank Mclntyre, supervisor
of basketball officials for the Pacific-8.
Mclntyre, himself a referee, for 18
years, directs a program comprised of
more than 50 officials, 24 of whom
handle the Pac-8 varsity basketball
games at $125/ each per game.
Finest conference
"I think we're one of the finest refer
eeing organizations in the country," said
Mclntyre, pointing out that other con
ferences used Pac-8 officials to call
their games. "Anyone can sit down and
be critical. It's a tough game to call."
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso agreed.
"Basketball is perhaps one of the most
difficult athletic events to officiate," he
said. "There are a lot of judgment calls
that can go either way."
"As long as you have officials, you're
going to have criticism," said Frank
Buckiewicz, a referee for two decades.
It is toughest on the officials, according
to Buckiewicz, "when the teams are
playing poorly, when the ball's not

going through the hoop."
When the ball is not going through
the basket, there is a lot of contact under
the rim as the players go for the re
bounds. "The thing we have to watch
most is the post play," said Mclntyre.
According to Mclntyre, 75 per cent of
the officials' calls are on action in the
three-second area. "The key is the most
important place to clean up," said vete
ran Pac-8 ref Jack Ditty.
Ditty, who worked the NCAA
Mideast Rigionals and Finals in 1973,
said that unless physical contact "puts
a man at a disadvantage, you normally
let it go, unless it is flagrant." "No
harm, no-foul" is the fan's interpreta
tion. Mclntyre said as an official, you
have to "use your judgment" in making
calls.
"Coaches want to see consistency at
both ends of the court," said Dißiaso.
Dick Harter, the Oregon Ducks' coach,
isn't satisfied with consistency. He said
the refs should "call the game as it is
written up in the rule book."
Some fouls and violations go unde
tected during a game because, as Ore
gon State coach Ralph Miller puts it,
"the speed and quickness of the game
today requires more than two officials
to do a good job.
Judge
"There is no question that at least
one-third of the offensive end of the
court can't be seen," said Miller.
"There is too much responsibility on
officials to make calls like goal-tending
and 10-seconds. The referee ends up
being a judge instead of an arbitrator."
Miller said that for a long time he has
advocated three officials for each game.
Ditty said, "I think it would create less
fouling — you'd get more stuff off the

ball."
Arthur Sykes, a second-year Pac-8
ref, worked under a three-official sys
tem tried in the Big-Ten. The trio of
referees "works pretty good some
times," Sykes said. "There's a place for
it."
Harter. however, said officiating "is a
very delicate, tough job. I don't think
there's enough good referees to have
three at every conference came."
Robert Herrold, a referee since 1953,
said that he worked "in favor of having
three officials," but that the cost in
volved is prohibitive.
Three refs
"We did try three officials," said
Mclntyre. "It comes back down to the
old story — economics. We won't see
them in the near future."
The Pac-8 fans would probably like
to see three referees at each game. That
way there would be 50 per cent more
"zebras" at whom to hurl diatribes.
"1 like the loud cheers and jeers,"
said Herrold. "The more noise you
get," said Mclntyre, "it brings up the
adrenaline, and that brings out the best
in you."
'Oregon toughest'
"If you're going down the list, Ore
gon's the toughest to referee," said
Buckiewicz. "It's the intensity—they're so
involved in the game." Buckiewicz
said that the fans' noise gets him going.
"I get pumped up just like a player," he
said.
Sykes called Oregon's homecourt,
McArthur Court, "a snakepit." Ditty
said, "Especially in the smaller towns,
the Northwest fans are more enthusias
tic because thev live and die basket

ball."
Ditty denied that the noise of the
hometown fans influences the referees
in making their calls. "A top-notch re
feree, believe it or not, doesn't let it
bother him," he said.
Harter does not think the howling of
the Mac Court throng is always benefi
cial to his team. "I think it goes both
ways," said Harter, explaining that he
feels the atmosphere created by the
Ducks' fans sometimes sway the offi
cials against the Webfeet.
Observers
Mclntyre has nine observers who
cover all the regular season games and
then file a report on the referees' per
formances. "On every game, we get a
report from a trained Pacific-8 ob
server," said Mclntyre. "Most of these
people are former referees or men who
have a thorough knowledge of the
game."
Each referee also files a report on the
game and on the performance of his
partner. Every month in the five regions
of the Pac-8 a meeting concerning the
job being done the officials is held. The
Pac-8 regularly comes out with a
breakdown on the performance of each
official.
Even with the evaluations, though,
there are few games which go by with
out both teams' coaches and the fans
without at least once expressing their
displeasure with a decision of the offi
cials. "They're human, they're gonna
make mistakes." said Mclntyre. How
ever, he added, "You can look at pic
tures, but sometimes pictures lie."
So the next time you scream at a re
feree for missing a play, just remember
what Dißiaso said, "You can't run the
game without the officials."

one-third of the offensive end of the
court can't be seen," said Miller.
"There is too much responsibility on
officials to make calls like goal-tending
and 10-seconds. The referee ends up
being a judge instead of an arbitrator."
Miller said that for a long time he has
advocated three officials for each game.
Ditty said, "I think it would create less
fouling — you'd get more stuff off the

ball."
Arthur Sykes, a second-year Pac-8
ref, worked under a three-official sys
tem tried in the Big-Ten. The trio of
referees "works pretty good some
times," Sykes said. "There's a place for
it."
Harter. however, said officiating "is a
very delicate, tough job. I don't think
there's enough good referees to have
three at every conference came."
Robert Herrold, a referee since 1953,
said that he worked "in favor of having
three officials," but that the cost in
volved is prohibitive.
Three refs
"We did try three officials," said
Mclntyre. "It comes back down to the
old story — economics. We won't see
them in the near future."
The Pac-8 fans would probably like
to see three referees at each game. That
way there would be 50 per cent more
"zebras" at whom to hurl diatribes.
"1 like the loud cheers and jeers,"
said Herrold. "The more noise you
get," said Mclntyre, "it brings up the
adrenaline, and that brings out the best
in you."
'Oregon toughest'
"If you're going down the list, Ore
gon's the toughest to referee," said
Buckiewicz. "It's the intensity—they're so
involved in the game." Buckiewicz
said that the fans' noise gets him going.
"I get pumped up just like a player," he
said.
Sykes called Oregon's homecourt,
McArthur Court, "a snakepit." Ditty
said, "Especially in the smaller towns,
the Northwest fans are more enthusias
tic because thev live and die basket

ball."
Ditty denied that the noise of the
hometown fans influences the referees
in making their calls. "A top-notch re
feree, believe it or not, doesn't let it
bother him," he said.
Harter does not think the howling of
the Mac Court throng is always benefi
cial to his team. "I think it goes both
ways," said Harter, explaining that he
feels the atmosphere created by the
Ducks' fans sometimes sway the offi
cials against the Webfeet.
Observers
Mclntyre has nine observers who
cover all the regular season games and
then file a report on the referees' per
formances. "On every game, we get a
report from a trained Pacific-8 ob
server," said Mclntyre. "Most of these
people are former referees or men who
have a thorough knowledge of the
game."
Each referee also files a report on the
game and on the performance of his
partner. Every month in the five regions
of the Pac-8 a meeting concerning the
job being done the officials is held. The
Pac-8 regularly comes out with a
breakdown on the performance of each
official.
Even with the evaluations, though,
there are few games which go by with
out both teams' coaches and the fans
without at least once expressing their
displeasure with a decision of the offi
cials. "They're human, they're gonna
make mistakes." said Mclntyre. How
ever, he added, "You can look at pic
tures, but sometimes pictures lie."
So the next time you scream at a re
feree for missing a play, just remember
what Dißiaso said, "You can't run the
game without the officials."

Pacific-8 official Mel Ross asks the crowd for mercy.
The two teams streak from one end of
the court to the other almost as fast as
the ball bounces up and down. The
white-jerseyed home town squad
moves out on a fast-break, and as the
star forward soars to the basket for a
lay-up, the red-clad visitor steps in his
way. The bodies fly — and the whistles
blow. The officials, the third team on
the floor, are now the center of atten
tion.
"Offensive, No. 42!" yells the
striped-shirted man as he crooks his
arm behind his head to signal the
scorer's table. Comments about the of
ficial's ancestry and eyesight cascade
from the stands.
For the official, "There's no way to
win," said Frank Mclntyre, supervisor
of basketball officials for the Pacific-8.
Mclntyre, himself a referee, for 18
years, directs a program comprised of
more than 50 officials, 24 of whom
handle the Pac-8 varsity basketball
games at $125/ each per game.
Finest conference
"I think we're one of the finest refer
eeing organizations in the country," said
Mclntyre, pointing out that other con
ferences used Pac-8 officials to call
their games. "Anyone can sit down and
be critical. It's a tough game to call."
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso agreed.
"Basketball is perhaps one of the most
difficult athletic events to officiate," he
said. "There are a lot of judgment calls
that can go either way."
"As long as you have officials, you're
going to have criticism," said Frank
Buckiewicz, a referee for two decades.
It is toughest on the officials, according
to Buckiewicz, "when the teams are
playing poorly, when the ball's not

going through the hoop."
When the ball is not going through
the basket, there is a lot of contact under
the rim as the players go for the re
bounds. "The thing we have to watch
most is the post play," said Mclntyre.
According to Mclntyre, 75 per cent of
the officials' calls are on action in the
three-second area. "The key is the most
important place to clean up," said vete
ran Pac-8 ref Jack Ditty.
Ditty, who worked the NCAA
Mideast Rigionals and Finals in 1973,
said that unless physical contact "puts
a man at a disadvantage, you normally
let it go, unless it is flagrant." "No
harm, no-foul" is the fan's interpreta
tion. Mclntyre said as an official, you
have to "use your judgment" in making
calls.
"Coaches want to see consistency at
both ends of the court," said Dißiaso.
Dick Harter, the Oregon Ducks' coach,
isn't satisfied with consistency. He said
the refs should "call the game as it is
written up in the rule book."
Some fouls and violations go unde
tected during a game because, as Ore
gon State coach Ralph Miller puts it,
"the speed and quickness of the game
today requires more than two officials
to do a good job.

Pacific-8 official Mel Ross asks the crowd for mercy.
The two teams streak from one end of
the court to the other almost as fast as
the ball bounces up and down. The
white-jerseyed home town squad
moves out on a fast-break, and as the
star forward soars to the basket for a
lay-up, the red-clad visitor steps in his
way. The bodies fly — and the whistles
blow. The officials, the third team on
the floor, are now the center of atten
tion.
"Offensive, No. 42!" yells the
striped-shirted man as he crooks his
arm behind his head to signal the
scorer's table. Comments about the of
ficial's ancestry and eyesight cascade
from the stands.
For the official, "There's no way to
win," said Frank Mclntyre, supervisor
of basketball officials for the Pacific-8.
Mclntyre, himself a referee, for 18
years, directs a program comprised of
more than 50 officials, 24 of whom
handle the Pac-8 varsity basketball
games at $125/ each per game.
Finest conference
"I think we're one of the finest refer
eeing organizations in the country," said
Mclntyre, pointing out that other con
ferences used Pac-8 officials to call
their games. "Anyone can sit down and
be critical. It's a tough game to call."
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso agreed.
"Basketball is perhaps one of the most
difficult athletic events to officiate," he
said. "There are a lot of judgment calls
that can go either way."
"As long as you have officials, you're
going to have criticism," said Frank
Buckiewicz, a referee for two decades.
It is toughest on the officials, according
to Buckiewicz, "when the teams are
playing poorly, when the ball's not

going through the hoop."
When the ball is not going through
the basket, there is a lot of contact under
the rim as the players go for the re
bounds. "The thing we have to watch
most is the post play," said Mclntyre.
According to Mclntyre, 75 per cent of
the officials' calls are on action in the
three-second area. "The key is the most
important place to clean up," said vete
ran Pac-8 ref Jack Ditty.
Ditty, who worked the NCAA
Mideast Rigionals and Finals in 1973,
said that unless physical contact "puts
a man at a disadvantage, you normally
let it go, unless it is flagrant." "No
harm, no-foul" is the fan's interpreta
tion. Mclntyre said as an official, you
have to "use your judgment" in making
calls.
"Coaches want to see consistency at
both ends of the court," said Dißiaso.
Dick Harter, the Oregon Ducks' coach,
isn't satisfied with consistency. He said
the refs should "call the game as it is
written up in the rule book."
Some fouls and violations go unde
tected during a game because, as Ore
gon State coach Ralph Miller puts it,
"the speed and quickness of the game
today requires more than two officials
to do a good job.
Judge
"There is no question that at least
one-third of the offensive end of the
court can't be seen," said Miller.
"There is too much responsibility on
officials to make calls like goal-tending
and 10-seconds. The referee ends up
being a judge instead of an arbitrator."
Miller said that for a long time he has
advocated three officials for each game.
Ditty said, "I think it would create less
fouling — you'd get more stuff off the

ball."
Arthur Sykes, a second-year Pac-8
ref, worked under a three-official sys
tem tried in the Big-Ten. The trio of
referees "works pretty good some
times," Sykes said. "There's a place for
it."
Harter. however, said officiating "is a
very delicate, tough job. I don't think
there's enough good referees to have
three at every conference came."
Robert Herrold, a referee since 1953,
said that he worked "in favor of having
three officials," but that the cost in
volved is prohibitive.
Three refs
"We did try three officials," said
Mclntyre. "It comes back down to the
old story — economics. We won't see
them in the near future."
The Pac-8 fans would probably like
to see three referees at each game. That
way there would be 50 per cent more
"zebras" at whom to hurl diatribes.
"1 like the loud cheers and jeers,"
said Herrold. "The more noise you
get," said Mclntyre, "it brings up the
adrenaline, and that brings out the best
in you."
'Oregon toughest'
"If you're going down the list, Ore
gon's the toughest to referee," said
Buckiewicz. "It's the intensity—they're so
involved in the game." Buckiewicz
said that the fans' noise gets him going.
"I get pumped up just like a player," he
said.
Sykes called Oregon's homecourt,
McArthur Court, "a snakepit." Ditty
said, "Especially in the smaller towns,
the Northwest fans are more enthusias
tic because thev live and die basket

ball."
Ditty denied that the noise of the
hometown fans influences the referees
in making their calls. "A top-notch re
feree, believe it or not, doesn't let it
bother him," he said.
Harter does not think the howling of
the Mac Court throng is always benefi
cial to his team. "I think it goes both
ways," said Harter, explaining that he
feels the atmosphere created by the
Ducks' fans sometimes sway the offi
cials against the Webfeet.
Observers
Mclntyre has nine observers who
cover all the regular season games and
then file a report on the referees' per
formances. "On every game, we get a
report from a trained Pacific-8 ob
server," said Mclntyre. "Most of these
people are former referees or men who
have a thorough knowledge of the
game."
Each referee also files a report on the
game and on the performance of his
partner. Every month in the five regions
of the Pac-8 a meeting concerning the
job being done the officials is held. The
Pac-8 regularly comes out with a
breakdown on the performance of each
official.
Even with the evaluations, though,
there are few games which go by with
out both teams' coaches and the fans
without at least once expressing their
displeasure with a decision of the offi
cials. "They're human, they're gonna

have to "use your judgment" in making
calls.
"Coaches want to see consistency at
both ends of the court," said Dißiaso.
Dick Harter, the Oregon Ducks' coach,
isn't satisfied with consistency. He said
the refs should "call the game as it is
written up in the rule book."
Some fouls and violations go unde
tected during a game because, as Ore
gon State coach Ralph Miller puts it,
"the speed and quickness of the game
today requires more than two officials
to do a good job.
Judge
"There is no question that at least
one-third of the offensive end of the
court can't be seen," said Miller.
"There is too much responsibility on
officials to make calls like goal-tending
and 10-seconds. The referee ends up
being a judge instead of an arbitrator."
Miller said that for a long time he has
advocated three officials for each game.
Ditty said, "I think it would create less
fouling — you'd get more stuff off the

ball."
Arthur Sykes, a second-year Pac-8
ref, worked under a three-official sys
tem tried in the Big-Ten. The trio of
referees "works pretty good some
times," Sykes said. "There's a place for
it."
Harter. however, said officiating "is a
very delicate, tough job. I don't think
there's enough good referees to have
three at every conference came."
Robert Herrold, a referee since 1953,
said that he worked "in favor of having
three officials," but that the cost in
volved is prohibitive.
Three refs
"We did try three officials," said
Mclntyre. "It comes back down to the
old story — economics. We won't see
them in the near future."
The Pac-8 fans would probably like
to see three referees at each game. That
way there would be 50 per cent more
"zebras" at whom to hurl diatribes.
"1 like the loud cheers and jeers,"
said Herrold. "The more noise you
get," said Mclntyre, "it brings up the
adrenaline, and that brings out the best
in you."
'Oregon toughest'
"If you're going down the list, Ore
gon's the toughest to referee," said
Buckiewicz. "It's the intensity—they're so
involved in the game." Buckiewicz
said that the fans' noise gets him going.
"I get pumped up just like a player," he
said.
Sykes called Oregon's homecourt,
McArthur Court, "a snakepit." Ditty
said, "Especially in the smaller towns,
the Northwest fans are more enthusias
tic because thev live and die basket

ball."
Ditty denied that the noise of the
hometown fans influences the referees
in making their calls. "A top-notch re
feree, believe it or not, doesn't let it
bother him," he said.
Harter does not think the howling of
the Mac Court throng is always benefi
cial to his team. "I think it goes both
ways," said Harter, explaining that he
feels the atmosphere created by the
Ducks' fans sometimes sway the offi
cials against the Webfeet.
Observers
Mclntyre has nine observers who
cover all the regular season games and
then file a report on the referees' per
formances. "On every game, we get a
report from a trained Pacific-8 ob
server," said Mclntyre. "Most of these
people are former referees or men who
have a thorough knowledge of the
game."
Each referee also files a report on the
game and on the performance of his
partner. Every month in the five regions
of the Pac-8 a meeting concerning the
job being done the officials is held. The
Pac-8 regularly comes out with a
breakdown on the performance of each
official.
Even with the evaluations, though,
there are few games which go by with
out both teams' coaches and the fans
without at least once expressing their
displeasure with a decision of the offi
cials. "They're human, they're gonna
make mistakes." said Mclntyre. How
ever, he added, "You can look at pic
tures, but sometimes pictures lie."
So the next time you scream at a re
feree for missing a play, just remember
what Dißiaso said, "You can't run the
game without the officials."
