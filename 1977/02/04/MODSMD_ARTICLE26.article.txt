# Lacrosse: fastest sport on 2 feet

### JBI Lieber 
The members of Stanford's lacrosse team have
a good thing going -and they know it. The team is
the best of the Pac-8 schools and was second in
Northern California last season with an 11-5 re
cord. And Lacrosse is only a club sport on the
Farm with the team practicing just three after
noons a week.
"What makes lacrosse attractive to players is
that it is a club sport," said team member Pete
Gerbino. "Just about everyone on the team was
involved in some varsity sport in high school and
they didn't want to put up with the routine and
demands of an intercollegiate varsity sport."
At the introductory meeting for the team each
year, coach Sam Sadtler says, "You're here to
have fun and play the game, but you 're here first to
go to school."
Study time
Gerbino said, "If it's midterm time, Sam makes
sure we've done all our studying and if practice
takes away from study time he says, Go study.'
Lacrosse is not the end-all."
Lacrosse players at Stanford are not "hardcore
athletes" in the sense that their lives don't revolve
around lacrosse and studying.
There are no curfews on Friday nights before
games.
Practices are not mandatory.
The attitude on the field is intense but fun.
Few statistics - if any - are kept.
And afterwards, oh yes, afterward there is a
keg of beer.
"Lacrosse is like a big fraternity," said senior
John Sprole. "Wherever you go in the country,
when you find someone who plays lacrosse,
you're automatic friends. You can sit down over a
beer."
Over half of this year's 30 member team first
learned lacrosse on the East Coast where it is a
major sport in high schools and colleges. Why,
back East people appreciate lacrosse and even
understand the game. Last year 10,000 people
attended the NCAA championships and count
less more watched it on ABC's "Wide World of
Sports."
Eastern sport
"Lacrosse developed back East," said Greg
Hoberg, who has been voted the most valuable
attackman by the Northern California Lacrosse
Association (NCLA) the last two years." For a long
time lacrosse was a private school's game, but
now public schools also field teams. Schools with
baseball teams don 't want to start a lacrosse team
because it is also a spring sport.
"When I was in high school, not many people
were left on the baseball team at the end of the
spring - they all joined the lacrosse team. In
baseball you wait for things to happen, but lac
rosse is a fast moving game."
Sprole said, "Lacrosse has the hitting of foot
ball, theplaymaking of basketball and hockey and

the speed of hockey and soccer."
Gerbino agreed. "You have everything in lac
rosse," he said. "You've got contact, have to run
your ass off, be able to handle a piece of equip
ment -the stick -and you've got to be able to think
ahead and react to possible situations."
But isn't lacrosse considered to be a rough
game?
WHdman's game
"People have misconceptions of lacrosse as
being a wildman's game," Hoberg said. "When
the opponent has the ball you can check (hit) any
part of his stick or gloves. And when the opponent
is within five yards of the ball, he can be hit with the
body - but not below the knees or from behind."
The only required protective equipment is a
helmet and gloves. Arm pads and shoulder pads
are optional. Still, Hoberg only remembers two
injuries the past four years.
The team survives entirely on money from the
Club Sports Council and interested donors.
Sprole estimated that during the season each
player ends up spending $100 of his own money.
This year, as in the past, the team is fighting to
gain varsity status or at least training room
privileges.
"I think every club sport at Stanford should have
training room privileges," Gerbino said.
Training
Hoberg said, "The other day Ken (Polk) went
down to the training room with a pulled hamstring
and the trainers couldn't and wouldn't help him."
Said Polk, "The marginal cost of the trainers'
time is a big fat zero."
Hoberg said he is "dissatisfied" with the way
the Athletic Department is handling club sports.
Saturday Stanford's lacrosse team kicks off its
season when it hosts a dozen northern California
teams in the round-robin tournament. Each team
will play three half games.
'Warm-up'
The tournament is a "warm-up" for all teams as
wins and losses will not be included in the final
standings at the end of the season.
The next two weekends in February the team
will compete in scrimmages before the season
officially opens Members of the team will be busy
until the middle of May playing about half of their
games on the road. The big trip this year is to
Seattle.
"It's more fun to play club teams because they
are at least as good as we are," Hoberg said.
"Last year it was almost sad how mismatched we
were against some of the college teams. We won
by too many goals."
"If Stanford's lacrosse team were to play an
NCAA team back East," Gerbino said, "we'd get
destroyed. But as far as on the West Coast, no
other college team comes close to us."
"We're better," Sprole said, "because we're
more organized than the other teams. We take
pride in our team."
