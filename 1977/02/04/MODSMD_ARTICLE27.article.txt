# Harter explains cage philosophy

### Dick Harter 
(Editor's note: With Stanford
taking on Oregon tonight, we
thought it would he appropriate
to let Duck coach Dick Harter
express what basketball means
to him. Perhaps the next time
you see him chew out one of his
players you 11 understand why
he did it.)

Basketball means many diffe
rent things to everyone who
loves or follows the game. To me
it is Mac Court when our team is
introduced, a great hustle play
by one of our players, a good
pass for an easy basket, or taking
an offensive charge to help win a
game. It is just as much the
drudgery or iun of a three-hour
practice, the warm feeling at six
o'clock when everyone has done
his best — and the empty feeling
on the days when we have not
improved. It is the inspiration of
14 players working on the
Nautilus machine at Autzen
Stadium at 6:30 a.m. or the de
pression on a player's face when
he looks at a cast on his hand.
For most players it all begins
with a ball and a basket. You
practice and dream, you dream
and practice and each day brings
only wins as your imagination
brings you championships. Your
first organized team leads you to
your first game. How little — if
any — is the sleep you get those
nights before your early games.
There is the sudden realization
that you can lose, that some of
your teammates do not care as

much as others and that — while
every game helps you to mature
— each game leaves a part of
your childhood behind you.
Suddenly you are in college
and flying for the first time in
your life to a strange city to play
a game you have played for 10
years and yet really do not un
derstand. For most, there is al
ways the balance of joy with
winning and discouragement
with losing. For the nights of
laughter there are the nights of
returning to sit at 3 a.m. by
yourself at center court with
10,000 empty seats for company.
The secret tears of broken
dreams must run down many
faces, as so few reach the top of
their athletic mountain.
Just as quickly as playing
started, it ends. Unlike many
sports, the game is no fun when
you can't make the same play
you made two years earlier. For
some, basketball becomes a
memory. But for others, their
first game as a coach becomes 12
times more thrilling than play
ing. That first loss underscores
the fact that it is also 12 times
more painful to lose. The
memories of coaching do not
fade: neither the sight of posters
asking for you to be fired nor that
of nets being cut down after
championships. The shots of
Steve Bilsky to beat Villanova
and Ron Lee to beat Stanford will
always be there, just as Gerald
Willet's diving hustle-play that
beat Washington can never be

forgotten.
The many players who seem to
come and go too quickly all add
to your life. Some leave with a
glow of satisfaction; others leave
with dreams shattered. The con
stant thought is, "Will those who
leave unhappy ever realize we
cared?" There is an increasing
awareness as years pass that
most basketball success is due to
parents, an earlier coach or an in
dividual's ambition. Yet we de
mand and demand and demand
because teamwork hard work and
enthusiasm can work miracles.
Why do some of us love bas
ketball so much? For me, the
game has a perfect balance of
finesse and power. To play it
well demands skill and courage.
But to emphasize one above the
other leads to a distortion of real
basketball. The game also re
qu ires more sudden decisions by
its players than any other sport.
These decisions lead to an em
phasis on teamwork and unself
ishness not demanded by other
sports. The greatest moment in a
young player's career should
come the day he discovers how
he can help his teammates with a

pass, a screen, or defensive help,
instead of looking at the game
through "one-on-one" eyes. The
great physical demands of play
ing basketball are matched by
the mental demands of playing
away from home with spectators
very close to the action. The in
tensity required to display skill
and finesse, make hundreds of
quick decisions each game, re
main physically alert and poised
can be achieved only through
long, long hours of hard work.
To play "real" basketball, one
must love the game. Otherwise
the hard work that it requires
would be too severe. In short, our
game belongs to the players who
have the capacity to love their
sport and sacrifice for their
teammates.
How great it is to pass through
part or all of one's life com
pletely involved! To play tin
game is great, but to love it is
greater. When does this love
end? Jim Murphy, Steve Bilsky,
Ron Lee, Bob Morse, Jim Haney,
Ron Billingslea, Mark Barwig,
Tom Northrup, Geoff Nelson and
many others know. Some things
are forever.
