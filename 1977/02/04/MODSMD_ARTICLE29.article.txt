# Swimmers face UCLA
## 
### Julie Fiedler 
Stanford's men's swimming squad will be faced
with its biggest challenge so far this season when
the Cardinals host UCLA tomorrow at 1 p.m. at
deGuerre Pools. The Bruins, who finished third in
last year's NCAA Championship, have a strong
team this season.
"This should be a very exciting and competitive
meet," said Card coach Jim Gaughran. "We're
going to meet them most heavily on their
strengths."
One of the most heated match-ups will come in
the 1000, 500 free and the 200 fly when UCLA
freshman Tony Bartle and Stanford Olympian
Mike Bruner go head-to-head. And, as many will
recall, Bruner came close to breaking the American
record in the 1000 free last week.
Other match-ups include UCLA sprinter Steve
Austin against Stanford's Dave Fairbank and Jon
Powell. Always an exciting event, the battle for the
first and second spots maybeanall-Stanford affair.
John Hencken
Kip Virts, a junior from Fort Wayne, Ind., has
been compared to 1976 Stanford graduate John
Hencken. But Cardinal All-American Stu Corliss
may prove the supposition false.
"All the races should be really close." Gaughran
sees a few weak spots in the Stanford lineup, but
optimistically predicts a chance to beat the South
ern California aquamen.
Although still involved in heavy training, the

Card team has cut down minimally on yardage and
has eliminated two of its morning workouts. "This
is the first time we've taken morning practice off
all season," said Gaughran. "I think everyone will
swim his best time all year and I'm sure a lot of
personal records will be set."
UCLA-Cal
One advantage the Cards have in their favor is
the fact that UCLA is competing against California
today. Formerly an easy mark, Cal's team now
boasts an Olympic silver medalist (Peter Rocca)
and many high finishers in the 1976 Nationals.
Gaughran notes that Stanford is usually theteam
that faces two tough teams in one weekend.
"We've had to go down and swim against (JSC and
UCLA on consecutive days, but the Southern
California teams have never had that challenge.
Now the four schools are a lot closer in ability."
UCLA has had a successful season thus far. Two
weeks ago, the Bruins outscored and outswam the
University of Tennessee, last year's second place
NCAA finishers.
George Haines, now in his second year at UCLA,
is characterized by Gaughran as "a man who
doesn't like to lose." Haines is the former coach of
the Santa Clara Swim Club, where his swimmers
accumulated 43 AAIJ National Team titles. Vari
ous Stanford swimmers have competed under
Haines, including Olympians Chris Von Saltza
(1960) and John Hencken (1976).
