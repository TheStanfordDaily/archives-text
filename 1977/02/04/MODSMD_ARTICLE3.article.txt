## 
### Kurt Cobb 
Tenants of thePeace Union Center of
Palo Alto will be protesting the city's
proposed eminent domain proceed
ings against their building at the regu
lar city council meeting on Monday.
The building, located at 424 Lytton
Ave, stands on the proposed site for
municipal parking lots.
The Peace Union began in 1970asan
organization dedicated to ending the
war in Vietnam. Although the union is
not as active as it once was, it con
tinues to coordinate the finances of the
tenants in the Peace Center.
Other tenants of the building in
clude the Palo Alto Tenants' Union,
Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom, U.S.-China
People's Friendship Association and
the Mid-peninsula Conversion Project.
All those groups plan to be rep
resented at the meeting.
According to City Treasurer James
Hudak, thecitv is legally bound to hear
only the property owners but has de
cided to hear any citizen wishing to
speak about the eminent domain pro
ceedings.
If legal preceedings begin, the city's
first step will be to condemn the land

and take it over. It will be up to a Dis
trict Court jury to decide on a fair price
for the land, according to Hudak.
The city has already obtained op
tions on 412 and 420 Kipling St.and
recently reached a verbal agreement
on 427 and 435 Bryant St. (the "old
Safeway lot").
The city council formed an assess
ment district in the University Ave.
area at its Jan. 17 meeting to finance
the acquisition and improvement of
these parcels. At that meeting, com
plaints from land owners in the as
sessment district represented less than
three per cent of the total property, so
the council decided to overrule the
protests.
The project will bring, under city
control two existing parking lots with
a total of 116 spaces. The parcels
which include the Lytton properties
could accommodate no more than 40
parking spaces, according to the en
vironmental impact assessment filed
by the city planning department on
July 9, 1976.
The total cost of the project is esti
mated at $791,000, an average cost of
$5070 per parking space.
