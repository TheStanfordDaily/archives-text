Vance to seek arms limitation
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance said
yesterday he intends to explore with the Soviet
Union a mutual cutback in conventional weapons
and arms sales as well as lowering the limit that the
two superpowers have tentatively placed on their
nuclear arsenals.
In his first interview since assuming office, Vance
said a reduction of non-nuclear arms "is of critical
importance" and "is the area where the largest
amount of money is spent."
Therefore, he said, while both the United States
and the Soviet Union must "try to break the logjam"
that has stalled completion of a new treaty restricting
strategic nuclear weapons, his agenda for his mis
sion to Moscow in late March also will include "the
broad subject of disarmament or arms reduction in
the conventional arms area."
One possible approach, he said, is to target areas
such as southern African and the Middle East for
pilot efforts to roll back arms shipments from the two
world powers.
At the same time, he said, he hopes with Soviet
leaders to find a way "out of the doldrums" that have
plagued negotiations to mutually reduce military
forces in central Europe.
In a striking departure from the "linkage" theory
that guided his predecessor, Henry Kissinger, Vance
said that pressing the Russians in one area, such as
human rights, did not necessarily influence Soviet
attitudes in another, such as strategic weapons
negotiations.
Burns pledges to work with Carter
Washington — Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Arthur Burns said yesterday he will cooperate with
President Jimmy Carter and Congress in encourag
ing faster economic growth and reduced un
employment this year.
However, Burns told the House Banking Commit
tee he doesn't think Carter's $31 billion economic
program will make much difference to the economy,
which he contended should grow quite well without
it. And he termed Carter's plan to give a $50 rebate to
most Americans "an inefficient way to stimulate the
economy."

Disaster area declaration extended
Washington — President Jimmy Carter declared
disasters in 14 more drought-stricken Northern
California counties while a Public Utilities (Commis
sion (PUC) study warned yesterday that the drought
will leave the state with a power deficit equal to 34
million barrels of oil.
State officials said that the disaster declaration
came because of damage to livestock, a major portion
of the $510 million estimated lost by the state's ag
riculture industry.
The action, brings to 37 the number of counties
under disaster status.
H.T. Sipes, chief electrical engineer, told the PUC
that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E) wi 11 be short of
energy every month this year except January and
December. Sipes said a fuel shortage looms in North
ern California if PG&E can't complete its nuclear
power plant near San Luis Obispo by mid-summer,
which is unlikely.
He said California mountain reservoirs are so low
that they cannot provide the hydroelectric power
that normally meets 25 per cent of the state's electri
cal needs.
A PG&E spokesman said the company first will try
its regular domestic fuel supplies, but may resort to
seeking fuel abroad.
Meanwhile, State Sen. Jerry Smith (D-Saratoga),
announced legislation yesterday for a $25 million
statewide water conservation program giving free
water-saving showerhead and toilet devices to the
public.
"The program would save at least 109,000 acre
feet of water per year, which is about 35 million
gallons," Smith said.
Ethiopian leaders execute rivals
Addis Araba, Ethiopia — Rival factions in
Ethiopia's ruling military council shot it out yester
day at council headquarters. The winning group said
the chief of state and six other members of the coun
cil were executed afterward.
An official statement issued after the battle ac
cused Brig. Gen. Teferi Bante and the others of plot
ting to eliminate "progressive" members of the

40-man Central Committee and move the Ethiopian
revolution to the political right.
It said the shooting took place after the seven were
exposed as secret members of an underground polit
ical movement, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary
Party and as supporters of the Ethiopian Democratic
Party,
Sentencing law delay attempt fails
Sacramento — An attempt to delay implementa
tion of California's new prison sentencing law fell
one vote short yesterday in the state Senate.
But supporters predicted they would pick up
enough votes from absent senators next week to send
the delaying bill to the Assembly.
The measure would postpone the law's effective
date from July 1 to Jan. 1, a step supporters say would
give lawmakers time to correct any flaws and insure
there is not a massive release of dangerous felons.
The new law will scrap the state's 60-year-old
indeterminate sentencing system, under which most
felonies carry a minimum and maximum term such as
one to 10 years and the time an inmate serves is
determined by the parole board.
Under the new law, most felonies would carry a
fairly close range of sentences, such as two, three or
four years.
One of the law's most controversial aspects is that
its sentencing provisions would apply retroactively
to current prisoners, which means that up to 1300 of
them could be released earlier than they probably
would be under the old law.
