# New storm hits East; West to send in gas
## 
### Associated Press 
A new winter storm dropped snow
on several areas in the Midwest and
East yesterday, as extra supplies of
natural gas began moving toward the
region to ease the energy crunch
caused by the cold.
Acting quickly under the new
emergency natural gas law, the Fed
eral Power Commission (FPC) ordered
the first transfer of gas from west to
east to aid shortage-stricken pipelines
and their customers.
FPC Chairman Richard Dunham
told a news conference the gas already
had started flowing. He said it should
take only a few hours to start aiding
eastern states with severe gas shor
tages but only to a relatively small de
gree.
Cov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yester
day that California had begun ship

ping some of the 10 billion cubic feet of
natural gas it will loan to Midwestern
and Eastern states this month. Brown
said two special emergency ship
ments, each of 2 million cubic feet a
day, were being sent immediately to
Buffalo and Philadelphia and sur
rounding areas.
Brown told reporters he hoped
Californians could give the East, Mid
west and South even more of the fuel,
saying California may be making a
nationwide plea for help this summer
because of the drought. He urged
Californians to conserve all the natural
gas they can so as much as possible can
be loaned to the weather-stricken East.
American Embassy sources in
Mexico City said Mexico will sell the
United States 40 million cubic feet of
gas a day at current interstate rates,
starting Monday or Tuesday.
