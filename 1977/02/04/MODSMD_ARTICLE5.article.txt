# Doctor files suit against hospital
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
A decision is due soon in a lawsuit
filed against Stanford Hospital by a
staff surgeon who alleges that his
rights of due process in a disciplinary
action against him were violated be
cause the hospital bylaws are in
adequate and unfair.
Neurosurgeon Lawrence Arnstein
claims in the suit filed in Palo Alto
Superior Court on Jan. 5 that . . the
bylaws on their face are violative of
due process."
Arnstein, suspended last July after a
woman he operated on died, now faces
the revocation of his medical staff
membership here. He alleges in an af
fidavit that "the administrative re
medies to be invoked were, in and of
themselves, inadequate from the
standpoints of fairness and due pro
cess ... a larger issue may be the fun
damental fairness of the administra
tion of the medical staff."
Arnstein, who is also chief of the
Department of Neurosurgery at Chope
Community Hospital in San Mateoand
a member of the medical staff at
Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City,
points out in theaffidavitthat themed
ical board, which is responsible for all
staff disciplinary action, is composed
entirely of Stanford faculty.
Discrimination
Arnstein, who is not a faculty
member, alleges that the composition
of the board discriminates unfairly
against non-faculty staff and has
jeopardized the accreditation of the
hospital.
Medical staff bylaws were men
tioned as one of the deficiencies extant
at the hospital according to the ac
creditation guidelines of the Joint
Commission on Hospital Accredita
tion (JCHA), the Daily reported on
Wednesday.
Arnstein would neither confirm nor

deny reports that he and fellow staff
member Dr. John Kieraldo have been
active in protests concerning the al
leged unfairness of the hospital bylaws
over the last two years.
In affidavits on file with the superior
court clerk, however, the University
cites three previous disciplinary ac
tions by the hospital against Arnstein
since his addition to the staff in 1968.
According to the all actions
were adjudicated with no complaints
under the present bylaws. The Univer
sity further states in the affidavits that
Arnstein has contradicted himself on
the point on which his lawsuit is
based.
Basis of complaint
According to John Schwartz, assis
tant vice president and counsel for
medical affairs, Arnstein's complaint
in court is based on the argument that
he is entitled to a de novo hearing on
his case (a proceeding at which evi
dence is introduced and witnesses cal
led).
Arnstein claims that what the Uni
versity has employed instead is an ap
pellate procedure, in which a previous
decision by the medical board is
merely reviewed, with no evidence or
witnesses being produced, said
Schwartz.
Yet Arnstein caused the postpone
ment of his scheduled hearing because
of his insistence that he was entitled to
an "appellate review" of the investiga
tion of the patient's death, rather than a
de novo hearing, Schwartz said. Ac
cording to Schwartz, this is where the
contradiction lies.
On June 28, 1976, Arnstein per
formed brain surgery on a patient who
died two days later. He was suspended
on July 9 after an autopsy revealed that
instead of tying off the external carotid
arteries previous to surgery, Arnstein
had tied off the internal carotid arteries
which supply most of the blood to the
brain, according to the affidavits.
Not contested
Arnstein's responsibility for the
fatal surgical error is not being con
tested by either side in the lawsuit,
Schwartz said.
Arnstein was notified on July 5 of
the reasons for his suspension, accord
ing to Schwartz. A few days later,
Arnstein waived his right to an im
mediate hearing as to whether he
should be suspended while the inves
tigation took place, he said.
"I'm assuming that apparently
(Arnstein) didn't interpret the medical
board's notice of charges (oh July 5) as
his notice of charges. He was actually
notified twice," Schwartz said.
Arnstein maintains that he did not
learn of the formal charges against him

until Nov. 16, after the Oct. 13 meeting
of the medical board at which it re
ceived the report of the investigative
committee and recommendation that
Arnstein's membership be revoked,
"effective immediately."
Edward Henshaw, legal counsel for
Arnstein, stated in an affadavit that he
"was led to believe" by the hospital's
legal staff that prior to any decision
made by anyone, a full hearing before
the board would be held. The lawsuit
is partially derived from an apparent
dispute over whether the report made
by the investigative committee was a
recommendation or an actual deci
sion.
Judge J. Barton Phelps heard oral ar
guments last Friday, according to
Schwartz. Attorneys for both sides
have until Feb. 8 to file final briefs
before Phelps makes a judgement on
the case.

On June 28, 1976, Arnstein per
formed brain surgery on a patient who
died two days later. He was suspended
on July 9 after an autopsy revealed that
instead of tying off the external carotid
arteries previous to surgery, Arnstein
had tied off the internal carotid arteries
which supply most of the blood to the
brain, according to the affidavits.
Not contested
Arnstein's responsibility for the
fatal surgical error is not being con
tested by either side in the lawsuit,
Schwartz said.
Arnstein was notified on July 5 of
the reasons for his suspension, accord
ing to Schwartz. A few days later,
Arnstein waived his right to an im
mediate hearing as to whether he
should be suspended while the inves
tigation took place, he said.
"I'm assuming that apparently
(Arnstein) didn't interpret the medical
board's notice of charges (oh July 5) as
his notice of charges. He was actually
notified twice," Schwartz said.
Arnstein maintains that he did not
learn of the formal charges against him

until Nov. 16, after the Oct. 13 meeting
of the medical board at which it re
ceived the report of the investigative
committee and recommendation that
Arnstein's membership be revoked,
"effective immediately."
Edward Henshaw, legal counsel for
Arnstein, stated in an affadavit that he
"was led to believe" by the hospital's
legal staff that prior to any decision
made by anyone, a full hearing before
the board would be held. The lawsuit
is partially derived from an apparent
dispute over whether the report made
by the investigative committee was a
recommendation or an actual deci
sion.
Judge J. Barton Phelps heard oral ar
guments last Friday, according to
Schwartz. Attorneys for both sides
have until Feb. 8 to file final briefs
before Phelps makes a judgement on
the case.
A decision is due soon in a lawsuit
filed against Stanford Hospital by a
staff surgeon who alleges that his
rights of due process in a disciplinary
action against him were violated be
cause the hospital bylaws are in
adequate and unfair.
Neurosurgeon Lawrence Arnstein
claims in the suit filed in Palo Alto
Superior Court on Jan. 5 that . . the
bylaws on their face are violative of
due process."
Arnstein, suspended last July after a
woman he operated on died, now faces
the revocation of his medical staff
membership here. He alleges in an af
fidavit that "the administrative re
medies to be invoked were, in and of
themselves, inadequate from the
standpoints of fairness and due pro
cess ... a larger issue may be the fun
damental fairness of the administra
tion of the medical staff."
Arnstein, who is also chief of the
Department of Neurosurgery at Chope
Community Hospital in San Mateoand
a member of the medical staff at
Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City,
points out in theaffidavitthat themed
ical board, which is responsible for all
staff disciplinary action, is composed
entirely of Stanford faculty.
Discrimination
Arnstein, who is not a faculty
member, alleges that the composition
of the board discriminates unfairly
against non-faculty staff and has
jeopardized the accreditation of the
hospital.
Medical staff bylaws were men
tioned as one of the deficiencies extant
at the hospital according to the ac
creditation guidelines of the Joint
Commission on Hospital Accredita
tion (JCHA), the Daily reported on
Wednesday.
Arnstein would neither confirm nor

deny reports that he and fellow staff
member Dr. John Kieraldo have been
active in protests concerning the al
leged unfairness of the hospital bylaws
over the last two years.
In affidavits on file with the superior
court clerk, however, the University
cites three previous disciplinary ac
tions by the hospital against Arnstein
since his addition to the staff in 1968.
According to the all actions
were adjudicated with no complaints
under the present bylaws. The Univer
sity further states in the affidavits that
Arnstein has contradicted himself on
the point on which his lawsuit is
based.
Basis of complaint
According to John Schwartz, assis
tant vice president and counsel for
medical affairs, Arnstein's complaint
in court is based on the argument that
he is entitled to a de novo hearing on
his case (a proceeding at which evi
dence is introduced and witnesses cal
led).
Arnstein claims that what the Uni
versity has employed instead is an ap
pellate procedure, in which a previous
decision by the medical board is
merely reviewed, with no evidence or
witnesses being produced, said
Schwartz.
Yet Arnstein caused the postpone
ment of his scheduled hearing because
of his insistence that he was entitled to
an "appellate review" of the investiga
tion of the patient's death, rather than a
de novo hearing, Schwartz said. Ac
cording to Schwartz, this is where the
contradiction lies.

Discrimination
Arnstein, who is not a faculty
member, alleges that the composition
of the board discriminates unfairly
against non-faculty staff and has
jeopardized the accreditation of the
hospital.
Medical staff bylaws were men
tioned as one of the deficiencies extant
at the hospital according to the ac
creditation guidelines of the Joint
Commission on Hospital Accredita
tion (JCHA), the Daily reported on
Wednesday.
Arnstein would neither confirm nor

deny reports that he and fellow staff
member Dr. John Kieraldo have been
active in protests concerning the al
leged unfairness of the hospital bylaws
over the last two years.
In affidavits on file with the superior
court clerk, however, the University
cites three previous disciplinary ac
tions by the hospital against Arnstein
since his addition to the staff in 1968.
According to the all actions
were adjudicated with no complaints
under the present bylaws. The Univer
sity further states in the affidavits that
Arnstein has contradicted himself on
the point on which his lawsuit is
based.
Basis of complaint
According to John Schwartz, assis
tant vice president and counsel for
medical affairs, Arnstein's complaint
in court is based on the argument that
he is entitled to a de novo hearing on
his case (a proceeding at which evi
dence is introduced and witnesses cal
led).
Arnstein claims that what the Uni
versity has employed instead is an ap
pellate procedure, in which a previous
decision by the medical board is
merely reviewed, with no evidence or
witnesses being produced, said
Schwartz.
Yet Arnstein caused the postpone
ment of his scheduled hearing because
of his insistence that he was entitled to
an "appellate review" of the investiga
tion of the patient's death, rather than a
de novo hearing, Schwartz said. Ac
cording to Schwartz, this is where the
contradiction lies.
On June 28, 1976, Arnstein per
formed brain surgery on a patient who
died two days later. He was suspended
on July 9 after an autopsy revealed that
instead of tying off the external carotid
arteries previous to surgery, Arnstein
had tied off the internal carotid arteries
which supply most of the blood to the
brain, according to the affidavits.
Not contested
Arnstein's responsibility for the
fatal surgical error is not being con
tested by either side in the lawsuit,
Schwartz said.
Arnstein was notified on July 5 of
the reasons for his suspension, accord
ing to Schwartz. A few days later,
Arnstein waived his right to an im
mediate hearing as to whether he
should be suspended while the inves
tigation took place, he said.
"I'm assuming that apparently
(Arnstein) didn't interpret the medical
board's notice of charges (oh July 5) as
his notice of charges. He was actually
notified twice," Schwartz said.
Arnstein maintains that he did not
learn of the formal charges against him

until Nov. 16, after the Oct. 13 meeting
of the medical board at which it re
ceived the report of the investigative
committee and recommendation that
Arnstein's membership be revoked,
"effective immediately."
Edward Henshaw, legal counsel for
Arnstein, stated in an affadavit that he
"was led to believe" by the hospital's
legal staff that prior to any decision
made by anyone, a full hearing before
the board would be held. The lawsuit
is partially derived from an apparent
dispute over whether the report made
by the investigative committee was a
recommendation or an actual deci
sion.
Judge J. Barton Phelps heard oral ar
guments last Friday, according to
Schwartz. Attorneys for both sides
have until Feb. 8 to file final briefs
before Phelps makes a judgement on
the case.
