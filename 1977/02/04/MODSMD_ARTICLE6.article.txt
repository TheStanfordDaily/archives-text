## Commons seeks license to serve beer 
### Mark Schleiss 
Encina Commons has applied for a
license to sell beer, according to Bob
Caselli, director of TDS food services.
The application was filed with the
state Jan. 27 and notice was posted
Feb. 1. Under state law, any facility
applying for a license to sell alcohol
must post notice of its intentions for 30
days to let the public know abut the
proposal and allow time for citizens to
file a protest.
Caselli said the major reason for ap
plying for the beer license is to in
crease the menu variety at Encina
Commons. "We've been thinking

about expanding our menu," Caselli
said, "and we think beer would be a
good addition."
The license for which TDS is apply
ing is an on-sale license, which means
that any beer sold would have to be
drunk on the premises. Caselli em
phasized that the license would not
restrict minors from using the Com
mons.
"All students under age 21 would
continue to be able to use Encina
Commons," Caselli said. "The only re
striction of an on-sale license would be
the condition that no beer could be
taken out of the facility."

Caselli said a public premises beer
license had been granted to TDS in
January 1976, for the proposed pub at
Tresidder. That license can not be used
by Encina Commons, according to
Caselli.
"We would need a specific and dif
ferent license for every place on cam
pus," he explained, "and the pub
license applied only to that particular
proposal."
The idea of a pub was opposed by
the University because under a public
premises beer license, only persons
aged 21 years or older could have en
tered the facility. The beer license for

which TDS is now applying does not
restrict entrance to minors and has al
ready been authorized by the Univer
sity.
"Our application has been approved
at the University level, and the ad
ministration is totally cognizant of our
plan," said Caselli.
Approval
Dan Williams, associate dean of stu
dent affairs and Director of Tresidder
Union, said that he has approved of the
TDS proposal of serving beer at Encina
Commons.
"We have authorized TDS to apply
for the license," Williams said. "If they
receive it under the condition that En
cina Commons will remain open to all
Stanford students, we will proceed
with the proposal."
Caselli said there was no way of
knowing how long the application
would take to be approved or disap
roved.
"When we posted notice for the pub,
it took from Aug. 19, 1975 to Jan. 23,
1976 to get the license...Providing no
body protests, it could take as little as
45 days to get."
Caselli said the reason for the delay
in getting the pub license was that a
student protested the application and
an investigation and hearing had to be
held on the protest.
Investigation
Cregory Rupp of the California Al
coholic Beverage Control Commission
is handling the investigation of the
TDS application.
"Each application examined under
goes three phases," Rupp said. "First,
the moral character of the applicant is
examined. Next, the premise itself is
inspected, and finally the financial
situation is examined. These precau
tions insure that the person applying is
a fit and proper person."
