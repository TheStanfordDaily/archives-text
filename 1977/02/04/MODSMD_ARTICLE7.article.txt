## Opinions Woman's place is in the home 
### 
Abigail Roeder

If you were to ask most Stanford
women if they wanted to be house
wives, the answers would most likely
be no (with a wide range of grimaces).
And if you asked the same women if
they wanted to have children, you
would probably receive an over
whelmingly affirmative response,
though with somewhat less certainty
and vehemence than the first answers.
Now ask the same women how they are
planning to accomplish having
families and yet not being housewives.
It is not necessarily innate to women
that they be the parents assigned to the
upbringing of the children; it is merely
the reality. There are few men who, if
pressed for an honest answer, would
admit to wanting the assignment of
child-rearing.
Nor is there an absolute truth that
the proper way to rear children is
through a sole commitment to the fam
ily structure. As a matter of fact, the
primary argument against the axiom
that a woman's place is in the home is
that there is no reason why either pa
rent should be tied to the position of
child-rearer. In an equal marriage, it is
said, both parents share the burden. Is
there any such thing as an equal mar
riage? What would your household
have been like if both of your parents
had run off to their intense offices
weekdays and some Saturdays? Can a
person be committed simultaneously
to both a family and a career?
Conflict
Civen the realities of family life,
therefore, it seems much healthier for a
woman to accept the fact that mother
hood may conflict with the demands of
a career. From this reality, a woman
can work to develop a lifestyle which

is most constructive and stimulating
within the constraints of motherhood.
A woman who walks into the role of
motherhood with ambivalence about
that role can only feel inner conflict
and subsequent unhappiness.
Does fulltime motherhood have to
be that bad? Wouldn't a lot of people
cherish the opportunity to have a
schedule as flexible as that of a
mother? Wouldn't a lot of people
cherish having the time to be commit
ted to other people as well as to them
selves or their jobs?
Through the communications sys
tem of the women's movement, the re
cent picture of the American house
wife has been one of a subservient and
unhappy drudge. If your mother fits
this mold, ask yourself why. Are
women drudges because being a
housewife is innately a horrid role or
has it come to be one? Perhaps women
of our mothers' generation merely
walked into the roles of motherhood
and family commitment unthinkingly.
I am not advocating the acceptance of
fate by Stanford women. I am saying,
"Take a close look at what is ahead ot
you."
Importance of family
Women coming out of a place like
Stanford have a responsibility to
themselves and to their communities
to develop constructive lifestyles to
tide them through the motherhood
years. The family in America must not
be permitted to dwindle so that
women can find themselves. Having a
family is a commitment which should
be accepted, for better or for worse, just
like a career.
If a woman is not willing to accept
that commitment for fear that she will

lose her identity, then she should
think twice before taking it on. It may
be possible, however, to reconcile the
dual commitment to family and
career. But a realistic plan must be de
signed which accounts for the numer
ous variables which must be balanced
if a woman is to fulfill her respon
sibilities both to motherhood and to
her career. These variables must go
beyond personal fulfillment and en
compass the needs of the family mem
bers who will be affected by the wo
man's lifestyle.
There is no question that the argu
ment being expounded is one which is
applicable to the upper middle class.
Note that I do not say that women
should not have jobs while raising a
family. In many family situations, the
necessity of a woman assisting in the
financial welfare of her family may be
the overriding concern of her family
commitment. The warning here is not
so much against women having jobs,
but against women having careers
which keep them from fulfilling their
overwhelming commitment to their
families.
The resolution of the dilemma bet
ween motherhood and career can
come only from within the woman.
Such resolution must be based on the
realistic evaluation of the cir
cumstances of a woman's life which
includes her real needs, her spouse
and her abilities.
But the importance of having a fam
ily does not lend itself to subjective
evaluation. Rather, it is an absolute
circumstance around which a woman
should design her lifestyle.

If you were to ask most Stanford
women if they wanted to be house
wives, the answers would most likely
be no (with a wide range of grimaces).
And if you asked the same women if
they wanted to have children, you
would probably receive an over
whelmingly affirmative response,
though with somewhat less certainty
and vehemence than the first answers.
Now ask the same women how they are
planning to accomplish having
families and yet not being housewives.
It is not necessarily innate to women
that they be the parents assigned to the
upbringing of the children; it is merely
the reality. There are few men who, if
pressed for an honest answer, would
admit to wanting the assignment of
child-rearing.
Nor is there an absolute truth that
the proper way to rear children is
through a sole commitment to the fam
ily structure. As a matter of fact, the
primary argument against the axiom
that a woman's place is in the home is
that there is no reason why either pa
rent should be tied to the position of
child-rearer. In an equal marriage, it is
said, both parents share the burden. Is
there any such thing as an equal mar
riage? What would your household
have been like if both of your parents
had run off to their intense offices
weekdays and some Saturdays? Can a
person be committed simultaneously
to both a family and a career?
Conflict
Civen the realities of family life,
therefore, it seems much healthier for a
woman to accept the fact that mother
hood may conflict with the demands of
a career. From this reality, a woman
can work to develop a lifestyle which

is most constructive and stimulating
within the constraints of motherhood.
A woman who walks into the role of
motherhood with ambivalence about
that role can only feel inner conflict
and subsequent unhappiness.
Does fulltime motherhood have to
be that bad? Wouldn't a lot of people
cherish the opportunity to have a
schedule as flexible as that of a
mother? Wouldn't a lot of people
cherish having the time to be commit
ted to other people as well as to them
selves or their jobs?
Through the communications sys
tem of the women's movement, the re
cent picture of the American house
wife has been one of a subservient and
unhappy drudge. If your mother fits
this mold, ask yourself why. Are
women drudges because being a
housewife is innately a horrid role or
has it come to be one? Perhaps women
of our mothers' generation merely
walked into the roles of motherhood
and family commitment unthinkingly.
I am not advocating the acceptance of
fate by Stanford women. I am saying,
"Take a close look at what is ahead ot
you."
Importance of family
Women coming out of a place like
Stanford have a responsibility to
themselves and to their communities
to develop constructive lifestyles to
tide them through the motherhood
years. The family in America must not
be permitted to dwindle so that
women can find themselves. Having a
family is a commitment which should
be accepted, for better or for worse, just
like a career.
If a woman is not willing to accept
that commitment for fear that she will

lose her identity, then she should
think twice before taking it on. It may
be possible, however, to reconcile the
dual commitment to family and
career. But a realistic plan must be de
signed which accounts for the numer
ous variables which must be balanced
if a woman is to fulfill her respon
sibilities both to motherhood and to
her career. These variables must go
beyond personal fulfillment and en
compass the needs of the family mem
bers who will be affected by the wo
man's lifestyle.
There is no question that the argu
ment being expounded is one which is
applicable to the upper middle class.
Note that I do not say that women
should not have jobs while raising a
family. In many family situations, the
necessity of a woman assisting in the
financial welfare of her family may be
the overriding concern of her family
commitment. The warning here is not
so much against women having jobs,
but against women having careers
which keep them from fulfilling their
overwhelming commitment to their
families.
The resolution of the dilemma bet
ween motherhood and career can
come only from within the woman.
Such resolution must be based on the
realistic evaluation of the cir
cumstances of a woman's life which
includes her real needs, her spouse
and her abilities.

ily does not lend itself to subjective
evaluation. Rather, it is an absolute
