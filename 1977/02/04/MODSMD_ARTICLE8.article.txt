# Letters: death penalty

'Toothless'
Dan Livingston's face can smile
broadly from the box in his editorial of
Feb. 2 as he proudly proclaims the
constitutionality of the death penalty
as well as the destiny of more than 300
prisoners waiting nervously on death
rows across the country. Livingston
must be an exceptional student if he
can find conclusive constitutional
evidence in support of the death pen

alty, while Supreme Court justices
have vacillated on this issue for de
cades. Livingston supports an Ameri
can interpretation of the biblical law,
"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth," but unfortunately this type of
reasoning, in the words of Tevye from
"Fiddler on the Roof," renders "the
whole world blind and toothless."

Save energy
It seems apparent from the reaction
of the Stanford community to the se
vere weather crisis in the east and
midwest that there are few who par
ticularly care that people are literally
freezing to death as a result ofa gas
shortage. But you may say, "I'm here
so what can 1 do?" The fact is that what
you do (or don't do) is extremely im
portant.
The natural gas shortage, as well as
the oil embargo of 1972, was not
created solely by oil companies. In fact
oil (and especially natural gas) prices
did not increase until several years
ago.
The problem is simple â€” overcon
sumption! We have allowed society to
mold a lifestyle entirely dependent on
an enormous amount of energy. But we
can (and should) change the situation
we live in. I am not advocating re
volutionary reaction, but merely peti
tioning for a new "social conscience."
Some small, but very important ac
tions we can take are turning lights
out when not in use, using less hot
water, driving your car less (and keep
ing it tuned up), playing stereos less
and with less volume, using electrical
appliances less often, turning down
thermostats and generally not wasting
energy on frivolous activities.
It is not enough to be aware of a
problem, something must be done.
Over half of the world's population
exists without such luxuries. Surely
we can conserve that which other# live
without. Be concerned and save.
