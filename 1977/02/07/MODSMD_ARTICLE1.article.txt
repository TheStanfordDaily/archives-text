# Stanford may loan money to parents
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Parents earning up to $60,000 a year
may be allowed to borrow money from
the University to pay for their chil
dren's education, if the Board of Trus
tees approves a parent loan program
today.
The board, meeting in Los Angeles,
will also be asked to approve approxi
mately $320,000 for facility improve
ments at Hopkins Marine Station and
will hear reports on fundraising here.
The parent loan program, if ap
proved, would permit parents to bor
row up to $6000 annually for their
children's tuition, room and board.
The plan would set aside a
maximum of $1 million from Univer
sity investment funds which would
otherwise be used for purchase of short
term corporate bonds and notes, ac
cording to Rodney Adams, director of
finance. Adams is slated to become
administrator of the new program.
Parents with an annual income bet
ween $20,000 and $60,000 would be
eligible to borrow funds at an annual
rate of 8.75 per cent if the proposal is
approved. The program will begin
with the class of 1981.
According to Adams, the program
would be self-sufficient, producing an
eight per cent return for the Univer
sity. The other 0.75 per cent would be
used for administrative costs plus a re
serve fund for bad debts.
The board will consider a $320,000
appropriation for remodeling the
Monterey Boatworks at Hopkins. The
building, first constructed in 1920,
will be completely reconstructed by
June 15 in order to accommodate di
vers in the summer program at Hop
kins, if the trustees concur with the
administration request.
The trustees will also hear a report
saying that December 1976 was the
best month ever for University fun
draising. According to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president of public
affairs December gifts totaled $18.7
million.
Two other reports will be presented
to the trustees. One outlines implica
tions of proposed federal and state
regulations on fundraising; another
details the cost of fund raising per dol
lar raised.
Rosenzweig said he will outline
regulation proposals which, though
they would not alter the fundraising
mechanism here, would require costly
and time-consuming alterations in
bookkeeping procedures and report
ing.
Joel Smith, special assistant to the
vice president for development, will
submit the result of his work on costs
of fundraising here. His report, which
determines costs and compares them
to other major private institutions
around the country, concludes that
"the costs of fundraising at Stanford,
while on the high side, are well within
a reasonable range."

around the country, concludes that
"the costs of fundraising at Stanford,
while on the high side, are well within
a reasonable range."
Parents earning up to $60,000 a year
may be allowed to borrow money from
the University to pay for their chil
dren's education, if the Board of Trus
tees approves a parent loan program
today.
The board, meeting in Los Angeles,
will also be asked to approve approxi
mately $320,000 for facility improve
ments at Hopkins Marine Station and
will hear reports on fundraising here.
The parent loan program, if ap
proved, would permit parents to bor
row up to $6000 annually for their
children's tuition, room and board.
The plan would set aside a
maximum of $1 million from Univer
sity investment funds which would
otherwise be used for purchase of short
term corporate bonds and notes, ac
cording to Rodney Adams, director of
finance. Adams is slated to become
administrator of the new program.
Parents with an annual income bet
ween $20,000 and $60,000 would be
eligible to borrow funds at an annual
rate of 8.75 per cent if the proposal is
approved. The program will begin
with the class of 1981.
According to Adams, the program
would be self-sufficient, producing an
eight per cent return for the Univer
sity. The other 0.75 per cent would be
used for administrative costs plus a re
serve fund for bad debts.
The board will consider a $320,000
appropriation for remodeling the
Monterey Boatworks at Hopkins. The
building, first constructed in 1920,
will be completely reconstructed by
June 15 in order to accommodate di
vers in the summer program at Hop
kins, if the trustees concur with the
administration request.
The trustees will also hear a report
saying that December 1976 was the
best month ever for University fun
draising. According to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president of public
affairs December gifts totaled $18.7
million.
Two other reports will be presented
to the trustees. One outlines implica
tions of proposed federal and state
regulations on fundraising; another
details the cost of fund raising per dol
lar raised.
Rosenzweig said he will outline
regulation proposals which, though
they would not alter the fundraising
mechanism here, would require costly
and time-consuming alterations in
bookkeeping procedures and report
ing.
Joel Smith, special assistant to the
vice president for development, will
submit the result of his work on costs
of fundraising here. His report, which
determines costs and compares them
to other major private institutions
around the country, concludes that
"the costs of fundraising at Stanford,
while on the high side, are well within
a reasonable range."
