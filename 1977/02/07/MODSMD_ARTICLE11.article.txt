# Letters: Pope, energy

Modest proposal
As we all know, the world is im
mersed in a bitter controversy caused
by the Pope's recent decree that
women aren't fit for the clergy. The
Pope stated that, "Christ was and re
mains a man;" therefore women can't
be priests. We don't understand this
logic, but there is such an obvious and
easy way to satisfy everyone that we're
surprised it hasn't been proposed be
fore.
Priests are supposed to emulate
Christ's celibacy. So why not simply
"de-sex" all priests? Recent
technological advances have made it
possible to remove human gonads
safely and relatively painlessly. If this
suggestion is adopted, then both men
and women can enter the clergy be
cause, with a little cosmetic surgery,
there won't be any difference between
them.
Imagine how this process would
work. When one takes the vow of
priesthood, asserting the willingness
to sacrifice anything for the glory of
God, proof of faith can be de
monstrated right away by a very real

sacrifice. Obviously this is what God
intended when he inspired Solomon
to proclaim "wisdom is better than
jewels" (Proverbs 8:11).
This procedure will have an addi
tional practical spinoff. Everyone
knows that the promise of celibacy is
very hard to keep in this tempting
world. Thus, if priests have no gonads,
it will be impossible for the Church to
suffer the embarrassment of having its
priests produce material evidence of
their transgressions.
We're sure that many more benefits
of this practice will become apparent
when minds greater than ours think
about it.

This letter is addressed specifically
to the women who use the deGuerre
pool facilities, but maybe the rest of the
Stanford community can apply it to
its own conservation habits.
It's easy for us to forget that Marin
County residents are asked to limit
their personal water use to 46 gallons a
day. Many of us simply haven't felt the
urgency of the problem.
I see a lot of water wasted at de-
Guerre every day. If all the women who
used the showers in the complex
began to turn off the water when they
lathered up and washed their hair in
stead of running the water the whole
time, and if they cut down on the
length of their showers, they could
probably save 20 gallons apiece each
day.
California is a state with vast water
needs. We're short this year. We need
all of the water we can save. Everyone
can contribute. Please try to conserve.

Grateful resident
In response to Tim W. Ferguson's
counterattack against "Palo Alto's War
on Drivers," I for one, as a resident of

College Terrace, am very grateful to
the city fathers for instituting the traf
fic rules that prevail. I also am grateful
for the fact that they had the patience
and interest to heed the local citizens'
complaints and to in
itiate several plans for College Terrace
in order to restore some semblance of
tranquility, finally settling for the pre
sent system.
I would suggest that in order to
avoid the anxiety factor, Tim might
leave a bit earlier to get to an appoint
ment on time or, if speed's the crucial
need, try tranquilizers; I understand
they reduce tensions and restore per
sonal harmony.

Data processing
I admire the investigative talents of
your reporter Steve Schiller and his
willingness to plunge into the compli
cated subject of computing for the Re
gistrar. However, I would like to re
emphasize a point that I made with
Steve that did not find its way into
your article. "Production costs" are
less than one-third of the Registrar's
data processing budget, the balance
being composed of such items as prog
ramming, specialized forms, inputand
output controls, etc. Thus while it is
true that raw computing is more ex
pensive on the 370/135 than it is on the
370/168, it is by no means clear that a
major difference in cost exists in the
total data processing budget due to the
current hardware arrangement. More
importantly, it was recognized that the
difficulties with the student system
conversion last winter and spring were
symptomatic of more basic problems
with the design of the programs. The
use of the 135 was authorized as a tem
porary measure pending completion
of a comprehensive review, which is in
progress.

As we all know, the world is im
mersed in a bitter controversy caused
by the Pope's recent decree that
women aren't fit for the clergy. The
Pope stated that, "Christ was and re
mains a man;" therefore women can't
be priests. We don't understand this
logic, but there is such an obvious and
easy way to satisfy everyone that we're
surprised it hasn't been proposed be
fore.
Priests are supposed to emulate
Christ's celibacy. So why not simply
"de-sex" all priests? Recent
technological advances have made it
possible to remove human gonads
safely and relatively painlessly. If this
suggestion is adopted, then both men
and women can enter the clergy be
cause, with a little cosmetic surgery,
there won't be any difference between
them.
Imagine how this process would
work. When one takes the vow of
priesthood, asserting the willingness
to sacrifice anything for the glory of
God, proof of faith can be de
monstrated right away by a very real

sacrifice. Obviously this is what God
intended when he inspired Solomon
to proclaim "wisdom is better than
jewels" (Proverbs 8:11).
This procedure will have an addi
tional practical spinoff. Everyone
knows that the promise of celibacy is
very hard to keep in this tempting
world. Thus, if priests have no gonads,
it will be impossible for the Church to
suffer the embarrassment of having its
priests produce material evidence of
their transgressions.
We're sure that many more benefits
of this practice will become apparent
when minds greater than ours think
about it.

This letter is addressed specifically
to the women who use the deGuerre
pool facilities, but maybe the rest of the
Stanford community can apply it to
its own conservation habits.
It's easy for us to forget that Marin
County residents are asked to limit
their personal water use to 46 gallons a
day. Many of us simply haven't felt the
urgency of the problem.
I see a lot of water wasted at de-
Guerre every day. If all the women who
used the showers in the complex
began to turn off the water when they
lathered up and washed their hair in
stead of running the water the whole
time, and if they cut down on the
length of their showers, they could
probably save 20 gallons apiece each
day.
California is a state with vast water
needs. We're short this year. We need
all of the water we can save. Everyone
can contribute. Please try to conserve.

In response to Tim W. Ferguson's
counterattack against "Palo Alto's War
on Drivers," I for one, as a resident of

College Terrace, am very grateful to
the city fathers for instituting the traf
fic rules that prevail. I also am grateful
for the fact that they had the patience
and interest to heed the local citizens'
complaints and to in
itiate several plans for College Terrace
in order to restore some semblance of
tranquility, finally settling for the pre
sent system.
I would suggest that in order to
avoid the anxiety factor, Tim might
leave a bit earlier to get to an appoint
ment on time or, if speed's the crucial
need, try tranquilizers; I understand
they reduce tensions and restore per
sonal harmony.

your reporter Steve Schiller and his

Steve that did not find its way into

less than one-third of the Registrar's

being composed of such items as prog

I admire the investigative talents of
your reporter Steve Schiller and his
willingness to plunge into the compli
cated subject of computing for the Re
gistrar. However, I would like to re
emphasize a point that I made with
Steve that did not find its way into
your article. "Production costs" are
less than one-third of the Registrar's
data processing budget, the balance
being composed of such items as prog
ramming, specialized forms, inputand
output controls, etc. Thus while it is
true that raw computing is more ex
pensive on the 370/135 than it is on the
370/168, it is by no means clear that a
major difference in cost exists in the
total data processing budget due to the
current hardware arrangement. More
importantly, it was recognized that the
difficulties with the student system
conversion last winter and spring were
symptomatic of more basic problems
with the design of the programs. The
use of the 135 was authorized as a tem
porary measure pending completion
of a comprehensive review, which is in
progress.
