# Escondido group seeks childcare program site

### Frances Draper 
Many unsuccessful attempts
have been made within the last
nine months to find find a new
home for the Stanford New
After-school Program (SNAP)
for children of students, faculty
and staff here, according to
Sandy Chapek, graduate stu
dent, mother and director of the
Committee on Childcare for Es
condido Village.
Despite the committee's ef
forts, it has been unable to find
an available facility that could
meet the requirements and
needs of the program, Chapek
said.
Last year, SNAP was estab
lished at Nixon Elementary
School for these children. How
ever, this fall Palo Alto closed
three elementary schools and
reassigned the children to those
school which were kept open,
including Nixon. The result has
been overcrowding and the loss
of the room formerly used for
SNAP at Nixon.
The situation has created a di
lemma for many parents, said
Chapek, particularly those who
are single. As a result, Escondido
is filled with small children who
are left unattended during the
day while their parents are in
class or working.
"All fall I had my phone ring
ing off the wall with parents ask
ing what had happened to the
program and what were they
going to do with their children,"
said Chapek.
New facility
The Committee on Childcare
has finally come to the conclu
sion that if SNAP is to be
reinstated, a new facility must be
built. On Jan. 19, the Escondido
Village Council approved and
recommended construction of
an addition to the Village Center
for use by SNAP.
This facility might also be

used for a pre-schoolers' morn
ing program and for other village
activities in the evening accord
ing to the Committee on
Childcare.
The proposal has been refer
red to the University for ap
proval and for drawing up an es
timate on total cost of the facil
ity.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Dan Williams, who has been
working with the committee in
trying to relocate SNAP, said
that although the University
feels it is not in a position to be
able to direct, design and con
struct on-campus day care cen
ters, it does feel it should make
every effort to facilitate

childcare arrangements for fa
culty, staff and students.
Final approval
According to Williams, once a
cost estimate has been made on
the new facility for SNAP, it will
be referrod back to the Village
Council for final approval. He
added that the committee hopes
that Escondido will be able to
pay for the construction with the
Village reserve funds. The
funds would be paid back over a
10-year period by student fees
paid to SNAP.
If the Village Council ap
proves payment for the project,
after reviewing the estimates,
the University will proceed with
construction of the facility, Wil
liams said.

Where's SNAP?
Escondido Village has two nursery schools that offer a variety of programs, but as yet there is no
program for elementary school age children. The Escondido Village Committee on Childcare
hopes to reinstate the Stanford New After-school Program (SNAP) as soon as they receive Village
Council approval of cost estimated for an addition to the Village Center.
