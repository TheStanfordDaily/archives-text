## Beavers outplay Stanford cagers 
### David Georgette 
Corvallis, Ore. — "When you
live by the gun, you're gonna die
by the gun," said Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso after Oregon State
showed Saturday night how it
survives on its guns in defeating
the Cardinals, 71-61.
"They shot the eyes right out
of the basket," said Dißiaso of
the Beavers.
The Smith combination paced
the Beavers. Senior forward Don
Smith canned 9 of 13 from the
field, his first seven baskets com
ing from more than 10 feet.
Senior guard Rocky Smith
nailed nine of his 16 field goal
attempts. The two teamed to hit
on nine of 10 Beaver hoops down
the stretch in the second half as
OSU turned a one-point deficit
to a 63-54 lead.
Good offensive game
"Offensively, this was possi
bly our best effort of the year,"
said senior Beaver guard George
Tucker. "Ice T," who Stanford
guard Mike Bratz said "creates a
lot of situations," played the
whole game and dished out 14
assists.
"We got our speed attack
going in the second half," said
Beaver coach Ralph Miller, "and
except for Bratz, we were able to
contain them pretty well. It took
us 20, 25 minutes to get un
tracked and play basketball. I
thought we did a poor job in the
first half."
The Beavers did a poor job
containing Bratz the whole
game. He paced the Cards to a
29-26 halftime advantage with
10 points in the first stanza. The
game's leading scorer with 24,

all six of Bratz' second-half field
goals came from at least 18 feet.
Saturday night was a big
turn-around from Friday at
Eugene where Bratz did not
score and fouled out early in the
second half.
The Bratz is back
"I'm glad to see Bratz come
back and play the kind of basket
ball he's capable of playing,"
said Dißiaso. "I'm pleased with
the way we played tonight, ex
cept for a few turnovers."
Another change from Friday
night was the one-three-one de
fense the Cards used much of the
game, with Kimberly Belton
playing the point. "We're trying
to get it so he can crash the
boards on defense," said Di-
Biaso.
