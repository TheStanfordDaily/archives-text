# Golf course to keep tax break
## 
### Steve Schiller 
The University has won a lawsuit against Santa Clara
County to retain the educational exemption from property
taxes on the golf course.
A decision by the State Board of Equalization had
changed the basis for taxing private golf courses, effectively
increasing the taxes paid. The county assessor first levied
the higher rate in fiscal year 1975-76 and the University had
paid the larger bill under protest while bringing the litiga
tion.
The Athletic Department "was very happy to get the
results," remarked Donald Tobin, associate director of fi
nance. He estimated that the decision will save $50,000 a
year in taxes.
The dispute between the county and the University cen
tered on the use of the course by alumni and private players,
who played 46 per cent of all rounds in fiscal year 1975.
In an opinion dated Jan. 26, 1977, Superior Court Judge
John Racantelli held that "as correctly contended by Stan
ford, the determinative consideration is not the percentage

or frequency of use, but rather the nature and purpose of the
use itself."
According to the opinion, the county had argued that the
educational exemption did not apply because the course
was used more often for play not essential for education,
including "non-student/staff recreational play."
Yet, the decision stated, "the limited and incidental use
by alumni and public members is fully consistent with the
overall educational purposes and activities of Stanford
University and does not impair the exempt status of the
property."
Gordon Weber, the University counsel from the law firm
of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Enerson, characterized
the lawsuit as "amicable," and thus not threatening the
relationship between the University and Santa Clara
County.
Tobin cautioned that the decision does not mean a reduc
tion of green fees on the 197-acre facility. Rates will proba
bly increase this year, he said, because of increasing costs
for water and utilities.
