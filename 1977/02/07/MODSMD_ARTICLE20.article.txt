# Kamikaze Ducks strike Cardinals
## 
### Chris Baker 
Eugene, Ore. — Oregon bas
ketball coach Dick Harter ran his
team into the ground during
practice last week because the
Ducks had lost four straight
games and were barely alive in
the Pacific-8 cage race.
But Friday evening, before the
65th — that's right — 65th con
secutive McArthur Court sellout
crowd, Oregon ran Stanford's in
jury plagued basketball team
into the ground 73-48 — that's
right 73-48.
"We lost for two simple
reasons," said Cardinal basket
ball coach Dick Dißiaso after the
debacle. "Oregon's offense and
Oregon's defense.
'Good execution'
"That's the best defense we've
seen this year, in league or out of
it,"he added. "You combine that
with good offensive execution
and you have a very good team.
And that's because Oregon has a
very good coach."
The victory was the Ducks'
most decisive victory of the year
and their biggest win ever over
Stanford. But it didn't start out
that way.
The Cards, thanks largely to
sophomore guard Wolfe Perry,
who finished with 22 points (13
in the second half] and freshman
forward Kimberly Belton
jumped out to an early 8-4 lead.
Ballard stopped
Stanford did an excellent job
of stopping Oregon star forward
Greg (G.8.) Ballard. The 6-foot-7
senior, who became the first
player in Oregon history to ac
cumulate both 1000 points and
1000 rebounds Friday, was held
scoreless in the first half.
But while the Cards were
handcuffing Ballard, Oregon
was shutting out Stanford guard
Mike Bratz, the second leading
scorer in the Pac-8.
Bratz attempted only three
field goals in the first half and
played just two minutes of the
second half before fouling out.
But while nobody seemed to

be able to pick up the slack for
Stanford, Oregon forward Ernie
Kent got the Ducks going.
Kent scored 10 points to put
the Ducks ahead to stay at 14-8.
"G.B. was covered and he told
me to stick the ball," joked Kent,
"so 1 did.
"We weren't playing with
force offensively and we
couldn't get the ball to G.B. be
fore, but we went really hard in
practice so we wouldn't be afraid
to shoot the ball. We missed
some shots in the first half but in
the second half the ball dropped
in."
The Cards were down by just
seven, at 29-22, at halftime. Now
the only reason the Mac Court
crowd didn't leave early was be
cause Perry's outstanding per
formance kept the Cards alive
and Oregon seemed to have as
much of a love affair with tur
novers as the state has with rain,
jogging and Ron Lee.
The Ducks broke the game
open in the second half, scoring
the first 11 points of the second
stanza to break it wide open.
