# Team still undefeated
## Card nine downs USF in opener 
### Chris Kamel 
Stanford's varsity baseball
team opened its season by
sweeping a three-game homes
tand over the University of San
Francisco Dons, 6-1 on Friday,
and 6-5 and 9-0 in a doub
leheader Saturday afternoon.
"A three-game set against the
same team is not really a good
indication this early in the sea
son," head coach Mark Mar
quess was quick to add after the
game. "I really don't know how
good USF is."
Before the season-opener on
Friday, Marquess said that the
Cards would need outstanding
performances from three or four
pitchers in order for Stanford to
be effective. This weekend he
got a fine performance from the
pitching staff as a whole which
held the Dons to only 12 hits in
the three games.
In the first game, the Cards got
strong performances from left

handers Rob Irwin, John Yandle
and Jerry Argust which allowed
Stanford to build up a 6-0 lead by
the fourth inning. Irwin is
scheduled to start at home today
against Santa Clara at 2:30 p.m.
"I was very pleased with our
pitching staff," said Marquess.
"Irwin and Yandle turned in fine
performances."
The only time the Dons
showed any promise of being a
formidable opponent for the
Cards was in the first game of the
doubleheader on Saturday. In
that game, Stanford continually
played "catch-up" baseball.
Stanford would fall behind by
two runs and consistently rally
to tie, only to fall behind again.
Down 2-0 in the bottom of the
second inning, first baseman
Tom Guardino singled to right
and shortstop Dave Perez drove
him home with a double to
center. The Cards later tied it at
2-2 in the next inning when third

baseman Gary Pitchford singled
in second baseman Todd Ervin
who had advanced after being
walked.
It didn't take USF longtobuild
another two run lead as in the
top of the fourth, Don first base
man Bob Bachtold homered over
the left field fence with catcher
Kevin Keating on base.
The Cards rallied again to tie
at 4-4 their next time up to bat
when right fielder Mike Codiroli
singled through the hole bet
ween the shortstop and third
baiseman, scoring Perez and
center fielder Larry Reynolds,
In the sixth, two USF errors
gave the Cards two runs and a
6-4 lead. Stanford never looked
back even though the Dons' Re
ggie Brown hit a solo homer to
bring USF within 6-5 at the end
of the game.
In the nightcap, USF pitcher
Ken Bullock's lack of control
gave the Cards a 5-0 lead in the

bottom of the first inning. Bul
lock walked six of the first nine
batters he faced and that com
bined with a wild pitch and a
basses loaded triple gave the
Cards the early momentum.
Righthanders Bruce Fiala, Bruce
Davis, and Larry Kuhn com
bined for a two-hitter to conserve
the 9-0 win.
According to Marquess, there
are still many things that Stan
ford needs to work on.
"We need to work on our leads
on bases," he said. "We didn't
get good enough leads and just
made mental mistakes on
basepaths."
Last year, Stanford set a school
record with 195 stolen bases.

In the nightcap, USF pitcher
Ken Bullock's lack of control
gave the Cards a 5-0 lead in the

bottom of the first inning. Bul
lock walked six of the first nine
batters he faced and that com
bined with a wild pitch and a
basses loaded triple gave the
Cards the early momentum.
Righthanders Bruce Fiala, Bruce

bined for a two-hitter to conserve

According to Marquess, there
are still many things that Stan
ford needs to work on.
"We need to work on our leads
on bases," he said. "We didn't
get good enough leads and just
made mental mistakes on
basepaths."
Last year, Stanford set a school
record with 195 stolen bases.

Stanford's varsity baseball
team opened its season by
sweeping a three-game homes
tand over the University of San
Francisco Dons, 6-1 on Friday,
and 6-5 and 9-0 in a doub
leheader Saturday afternoon.
"A three-game set against the
same team is not really a good
indication this early in the sea
son," head coach Mark Mar
quess was quick to add after the
game. "I really don't know how
good USF is."
Before the season-opener on
Friday, Marquess said that the
Cards would need outstanding
performances from three or four
pitchers in order for Stanford to
be effective. This weekend he
got a fine performance from the
pitching staff as a whole which
held the Dons to only 12 hits in
the three games.
In the first game, the Cards got
strong performances from left

handers Rob Irwin, John Yandle
and Jerry Argust which allowed
Stanford to build up a 6-0 lead by
the fourth inning. Irwin is
scheduled to start at home today
against Santa Clara at 2:30 p.m.
"I was very pleased with our
pitching staff," said Marquess.
"Irwin and Yandle turned in fine
performances."
The only time the Dons
showed any promise of being a
formidable opponent for the
Cards was in the first game of the
doubleheader on Saturday. In
that game, Stanford continually
played "catch-up" baseball.
Stanford would fall behind by
two runs and consistently rally
to tie, only to fall behind again.
Down 2-0 in the bottom of the
second inning, first baseman
Tom Guardino singled to right
and shortstop Dave Perez drove
him home with a double to
center. The Cards later tied it at
2-2 in the next inning when third
