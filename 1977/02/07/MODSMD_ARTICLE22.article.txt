Terry Albritton won the Los Angeles Times
Indoor Meet shot put event Friday night with a
70-6V2 throw, the best indoor put in the world in
three years.
The Stanford senior, exhausted from a mid
term all-nighter Wednesday night and just three
or four hours sleep Thursday night, defeated
Mac Wilkins and Al Feuerbach with the first two
70-foot indoor puts by anyone in three years.
"I was up Wednesday night all night studying
for a mid-term," Albritton said. "Thursday I was
up until 2 a.m. and had to get up three or four
hours later to go down to Los Angeles."
Admittedly a bit surprised by his showing,
Albritton said, "You usually have your best
throws when you least expect it because you
don't have a-ny anxieties."
Albritton threw 70-5 on his third throw to
become the first collegian to ever surpass 70 feet
indoors. That throw, and his winning 70-6V2
put, both broke the NCAA indoor shot put stan

dard of 68-2V2 he established last week while
winning the shot at the Oregon Indoor Meet.
Albritton's two 70 foot throws, shown Satur
day afternoon on tape delay on the nationally
televised CBS Sports Spectacular, topped his
previous career indoor best of 69-0 3 /4.
"Payton Jordan has been a help to me since
I've returned," Albritton said, crediting the
Stanford track coach with helping him correct
mistakes in his technique. He also said that he
was finally adjusting to the "cultural shock of
being back at Stanford."
Junior James Lofton finished second in the
long jump at the Los Angeles meet with a leap of
25-5%.
In weekend track and field action in Northern
California, a trio of Stanford athletes took their
events at the College of San Mateo All-Comers
Meet. Freshman Gordy Banks won the 200-
meter dash in 21.3 and senior Alan Sheats won
the 400 with a 48.1 clocking. Junior Tom Ellis
captured the javelin throw with a IH3-1 toss.
