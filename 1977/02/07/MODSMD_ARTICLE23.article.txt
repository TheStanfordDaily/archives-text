# Cards drowned by UCLA
## 
### Julie Fiedler 
Although three deGuerre pool
records were broken by Stanford
swimmers in Saturday's meet
against UCLA, the Cards
couldn't seem to match their op
ponent's depth, as they fell to the
Bruins, 77-36.
The results indicate slightly
more first place finishes by Stan
ford, but in the final tally, the
points earned through the sec
ond and third places fell in the
Bruins' favor.
Stanford's Olympic Champ
ion Mike Bruner turned in
perhaps the two most impressive
performances in breaking pool
records in both the 200 yard
free-style and 200 yard butterfly.
"I was really happy with all
my swims," said the sophomore
from Stockton who also swam a
come-from-behind race to win
the 500 free. "I was especially
psyched for the 200 free," the
event in which Bruner swam a
lifetime best.
Stanford's Dave Fairbank, a
three-time All American, also
broke a pool record in the 50 free.
Swimming a 20.58, Fairbank
bettered his own deGuerre pool
record of 20.6 set in 1975.
Regarded as a "natural
athlete" by his coaches, Fair
bank could be the first swimmer
ever to break the twenty second
mark in the 50 free. "1 need two
to three weeks to taper," says
Fairbank who is setting his
under-20 goal for the NCAA fi
nals in March.
Another winner for the Cards
was junior Stu Corliss. With a
time of 2:08.155 in the 200
breast, Corliss made qualifying
time for the Nationals.
As predicted earlier in the
week by head coach Jim Gaug
hran, Stanford's weakest spots
were the backstroke and the in
dividual medley events. UCLA
swept the 200 yard back with
world-premier swimmer Bruce
Hardcastle establishing a fourth
deGuerre record (1:55.46).
Tapering for the first time all
season, many of the Stanford
swimmers cut previous times by
as much as three or four seconds.
Besides Bruner, Fairbank and
Corliss, junior Bill Chao,
sophomores Scott O'Connor and
Cliff Lowell and freshmen Paul
Hartloff and Ken Shilling all set
new personal marks. Still in
volved in vigorous training
however, the Cards are setting
all goals for the Nationals, held
in Cleveland March 24-26.

The third place NCAA Bruins
entered Saturday's meet just off a
team defeat. In a dual meet Fri
day afternoon, the Cal Bears
upset UCLA, 69-44. UCLA coach
George Haines said the team did
not get discouraged however.
"Cal was shaved down and
rested —they wanted to make
national qualifying times. 1
know they couldn't have beaten
us if they hadn't shaved down."

however, the Cards are setting
all goals for the Nationals, held
in Cleveland March 24-26.

The third place NCAA Bruins
entered Saturday's meet just off a
team defeat. In a dual meet Fri
day afternoon, the Cal Bears
upset UCLA, 69-44. UCLA coach
George Haines said the team did
not get discouraged however.
"Cal was shaved down and
rested —they wanted to make
national qualifying times. 1
know they couldn't have beaten
us if they hadn't shaved down."

Cards. Fairbank's time is the fastest time recorded in the nation
in the 50 so far this season.
Although three deGuerre pool
records were broken by Stanford
swimmers in Saturday's meet
against UCLA, the Cards
couldn't seem to match their op
ponent's depth, as they fell to the
Bruins, 77-36.
The results indicate slightly
more first place finishes by Stan
ford, but in the final tally, the
points earned through the sec
ond and third places fell in the
Bruins' favor.
Stanford's Olympic Champ
ion Mike Bruner turned in
perhaps the two most impressive
performances in breaking pool
records in both the 200 yard
free-style and 200 yard butterfly.
"I was really happy with all
my swims," said the sophomore
from Stockton who also swam a
come-from-behind race to win
the 500 free. "I was especially
psyched for the 200 free," the
event in which Bruner swam a
lifetime best.
Stanford's Dave Fairbank, a
three-time All American, also
broke a pool record in the 50 free.
Swimming a 20.58, Fairbank
bettered his own deGuerre pool
record of 20.6 set in 1975.
Regarded as a "natural
athlete" by his coaches, Fair
bank could be the first swimmer
ever to break the twenty second
mark in the 50 free. "1 need two
to three weeks to taper," says
Fairbank who is setting his
under-20 goal for the NCAA fi
nals in March.
Another winner for the Cards
was junior Stu Corliss. With a
time of 2:08.155 in the 200
breast, Corliss made qualifying
time for the Nationals.
As predicted earlier in the
week by head coach Jim Gaug
hran, Stanford's weakest spots
were the backstroke and the in
dividual medley events. UCLA
swept the 200 yard back with
world-premier swimmer Bruce
Hardcastle establishing a fourth
deGuerre record (1:55.46).
Tapering for the first time all
season, many of the Stanford
swimmers cut previous times by
as much as three or four seconds.
Besides Bruner, Fairbank and
Corliss, junior Bill Chao,
sophomores Scott O'Connor and
Cliff Lowell and freshmen Paul
Hartloff and Ken Shilling all set
new personal marks. Still in
volved in vigorous training
however, the Cards are setting
