# Dump running out of space
## Whither Stanford garbage?

The Palo Alto dump will reach its maximum capacity in
the next four or five years, and the University, its single
biggest user, is already discussing possible alternatives for
refuse disposal, according to Director of Plant Services
Jason Mavis.
The University, excluding the Medical Center, deposits
approximately 10,3,000 cubic yards of solid waste into the
dump annually, close to nine per cent of the dump's yearly
(111.
"One of the long-range alternatives here is the possibility
of boilers that will burn garbage," Mavis said.
These boilers, which would be completely nonpol
luting, would require construction of a waste-processing
plant that would remove recyclable metal, then process the
remaining waste as combustible fuel for steam production.
Mavis said.
He added, however, that "waste-processing plants are

now prohibitively expensive."
Mavis also said this program would take 7-10 years to
implement, and this would be at least three years after the
Palo Alto dump is expected to close.
The possibility of this potentially crucial interim period,
and the absence of an economically feasible waste recovery
system, may force the Palo Alto City Council to approve
adding an emergency second tier to the dump, according to
Larry White, director of the Palo Alto Nature and Science
Department.
A second tier would mean raising the capacity level of the
dump by approximately 10 feet, Mavis explained.
Though this measure would extend the life of the dump,
said Mavis, it could threaten the surrounding wildlife and
environment.
The Army Corps of Engineers, which has control of in
land waterways, opposes any more extension into San
Francisco Bay for the purpose of waste disposal. Mavis said.
