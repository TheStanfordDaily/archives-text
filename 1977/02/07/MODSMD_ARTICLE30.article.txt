Rally opposes Gandhi policies
New Delhi, India — In a massive display of
anti-government sentiment, 200,000 persons
roared approval yesterday as a diverse group of
opposition leaders urged the ouster of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi in March's parliamen
tary elections.
The orderly but enthusiastic crowd cheered
wildly as Jagjivan Ram, leader of a rebel lion in
the ruling Congress party, and Jayaprakash
Narayan, a disciple of independence leader
Mohandas Gandhi, denounced the prime
minister's 11-year reign and her 19-month
emergency suspension of Indian democracy.
"There were more people in Indian jails dur
ing the emergency than in British jails before
independence," said the ailing 74-year-old
Narayan, who was imprisoned for the first five
months of the emergency and released when
both his kidneys failed.
Other speakers from different regions and
ideologies all told the rally the choice for In
dian voters next month was between "dictator
ship and democracy."
The large turnout further bolstered spirits of
the opposition, which initially felt it had little
chance of defeating Gandhi when she an
nounced the elections three weeks ago.
Yesterday's rally was considered a symbolic
victory for the opposition because it was twice
as large as a public meeting addressed by Gan
dhi at the same site Saturday.
Gandhi's rally ended prematurely, after
large groups of a restive, unresponsive crowd
of 100,000 walked out before she finished
speaking.
Gandhi, shaken by Ram's resignation from
her cabinet four days ago, received another
setback over the weekend when former Presi
dent V.V. Giri endorsed an opposition demand
foranend to the continuing suspension of civil

liberties.
Congress discusses tax plans
Washington — This week may provide a
further clue on how Congress plans to deal
with the sluggish economy — whether Ameri
cans will get an instant rebate or a long-term
tax cut.
But don't expect a firm answer immediately.
Because of the shape of President Jimmy Car
ter's proposals and the number of committees
involved, it will probably take Congress until
the end of March to complete work on an
economic-stimulus program.
The House Ways and Means Committee is
continuing public hearings this week on the
Carter tax plan, and the Senate Budget Com
mittee will work on an emergency resolution
that is necessary to accommodate any kind of
economic stimulus.
On the economy, there is evidence that Car
ter's "honeymoon" with the heavily Democra
tic Congress may be over. There is surprisingly
sharp opposition to his two-year $31.2 billion
stimulus proposal, with most of the heat di
rected at the plan to mail a $50 check to virtu
ally every American.
If the rebate idea is dumped, a likely alterna
tive would be a permanent across-the-board
tax cut for individuals, although it is generally
conceded this could not give the economy the
quick shot-in-the-arm that the administration
says is necessary.
Already, the House Budget Committee has
recommended doubling the $1.8 billion that
Carter proposed in emergency public-works
and job-creation spending over tlue next eight
months.
Congress reviews gas shortage
Washington — Congress, which last week

gave President Jimmy Carter the temporary au
thority he sought to deal with the current
natural gas crisis, now is looking toward the
White House for a sign on how to cope with
long-range shortages.
Lawmakers from gas-producing states claim
that Carter has little choice but to recommend
lifting federal price controls from interstate
natural gas. They predict Congress will have to
buy such a proposal this time, after rejecting
deregulation measures for the past two de
cades.
Those who support price controls are less
certain. They say there is no guarantee the ad
ministration will recommend deregulation
and might propose modifying rather than
ditching the price limits.
Both camps are waiting to see what is in the
long-range energy bill Carter plans to submit in
April before making their moves.
The emergency legislation Congress ap
proved, and Carter signed, last week gives the
president the authority through April 30 to
divert gas to areas where supplies are the scar
cest because of the unusually fierce winter. It
also frees some gas from federal price controls
through July 31.
It was never portrayed as anything but a
temporary measure to meet urgent needs,
either by the White House or its congressional
sponsors. And House and Senate leaders were
able to move it through quickly only because of
the severity of the crisis and assurances from
the White House that Carter's energy bill
would offer some kind of solution to the
natural gas problem.
Students refuse to go home
Johannesburg, South Africa — More than
300 black Rhodesian students who were al

legedly kidnaped by black guerrillas from a
school last week refused yesterday to return
with their parents, reporters on the scene said.
"We know our mothers were intimidated by
Prime Minister lan Smith's government to
come pick us up against their will," one stu
dent who refused to go home reportedly said.
This has been confirmed by a number of pa
rents in private discussions in neighboring
Botswana, where parents conferred with their
children in private at the district commis
sioner's office.
Reporters said 333 of 384 students refused to
return to Rhodesia, which is ruled by Smith's
white-minority government.
A spokesman for the parents said he had
evidence the children were forced to leave the
mission school in Rhodesia. He said he was
thankful the Botswana government had al
lowed the parents to speak to their children.
There was no immediate reaction from the
Rhodesian government.
Trudeau to speak in Washington
Ottawa, Canada — On his visit to
Washington this month, Prime Minister Pierre
Elliott Trudeau will tell President Jimmy Car
teranda joint session ofCongress how he plans
to keep Canada united in the face of the seces
sionist movement in Quebec province, sources
here say.
The possibility was raised in some quarters
here that Trudeau also may discuss increased
exports of Canadian oil and natural gas, badly
needed in the United States because of the
cold-weather crisis.
Trudeau has said the Feb. 21-22 visit will
give him an opportunity to "talk about the state
of the Canadian nation." He added: "One can
not discuss that today without noting and
examining the separatist problem in Quebec."

The prime minister's visit to Washington fol
lows last month's trip to New York by Rene
Levesque, head of Quebec's separatist Parti
Quebecois government, to tell financiers that
Quebec independence is as inevitable as
American independence from Britain 200
years ago.
Trudeau is reported prepared to use his
speech to Congress Feb. 22 — the first ever
before that body by a Canadian prime minister
— to rebut Levesque's claims, emphasizing
that Quebec voters did not opt for separatism
when they elected a Parti Quebecois govern
ment Nov. 15.
Ford returns to teach at Yale
New Haven, Conn. — A well-tanned Gerald
Ford returned to Yale University, his law
school alma mater yesterday, to try his hand at
teaching.
Before his arrival, Yale professors evaluated
Ford's impact as president.
"I do not give him high marks for economy,"
said James Tobin, chairman of Yale's economic
department.
But he said Ford "will always be remem
bered for coming in after a period of grace and
restoring decency and calm to the govern
ment."
Ford's visit to Yale is part of the Chubb Fel
low program that has brought numerous nota
ble persons to the campus on an informal basis.
