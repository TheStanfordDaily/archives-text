# $200 self-help increase approved in spite of march
## 
### Doug Hyde Dean Eyre 
The proposed $200 increase in self
help expectations for students on fi
nancial aid was approved by a close
vote Friday at a meeting of the Com
mittee for Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids (C-UAFA).
The 5 to 4 vote on Director of Finan
cial Aids Robert Huff's recommenda
tion came after a two-hour meeting
which began with the appearance of
over 60 students who said they rep
resented "concerned black students
and minorities in general."
If approved by the Provost's Office
and the Faculty Senate, the $200 in
crease would apply to all those paying
self-help with the exception of enter
ing freshmen from the "low income"
category, whose self-help would in
crease by $100.
Self-help expectations are the
amounts of money that students must
pay toward their education and are
separate from the amount contributed
by the family or earned during the
summer months.
An increase in work-study wages is
expected to provide $50 of the self
help increase and the rest of the money
would be offered to the students in the
form of long term loans, said Huff.
A proposed amendment to Huff's re
commendation by Assoc. Education
Prof. Denis Phillips, which would
have set the self-help expectation at
$150, was defeated by a 5 to 4 vote.
According to C-UAFA student
member Edward Sosa, "the 60 stu
dents that came made a big impact on

the committee . . . without their ap
pearance there would have been only
30 minutes of discussion."
The spokesman for the marching
students, Warner Session, explained
that the students went to the meeting
because "we wanted to be in a position
of acting on it (change in self-help ex
pectations) before they voted rather
than react once the vote was taken."
Speaking before the C-UAFA mem
bers and the students that had
squeezed in to listen, Session said he
hoped the committee would consider
such things as a historically high un
employment rate for black college
youths during the summer months, the
"particular burden" for minority
seniors who have to apply to graduate
school and the fact that this would be
the second self-help change in two
years although there has not been a

comparable rise in the median income
of black and other minority families in
the country.
After the measure had passed, Ses
sion said that the students' efforts may
still keep the recommendation from
reaching final approval.
Session said the next step in com
municating the students' views will be
the formation of a task force represent
ing the entire minority community "to
deal with the problem in hand."
C-UAFA Chairman William Chace
of the English Department said after
the meeting that Huff's recommenda
tion was approved with "serious re
servations" and that these reservations
will be expressed to the Provost's Of
fice.
Committee member Colin Mi wa said
that "the decision is not decisive" and
that "any further conflict will be in

(the Provost's) office."
He added that various comments,
including the statement given by the
students from the march, will be in
cluded in the committee's recommen
dation.
In his recommendation to C-UAFA,
Huff cited rising costs as the principal
reason for increasing self-help. Costs
of financial aid for next year are ex
pected to be $1.9 million higher than
this year, according to Huff.
Of the $1.9 million, the University
hopes to get $600,000 by increasing
self-help, according to Huff. The self
help increase would cover 31.5 per
cent of the cost increase for these stu
dents, he said.
Additional money is expected to
come from an increase in tuition pay
ments and from an increase in outside
awards, grants or donations, said Huff.

ing the entire minority community "to
deal with the problem in hand."
C-UAFA Chairman William Chace
of the English Department said after
the meeting that Huff's recommenda
tion was approved with "serious re
servations" and that these reservations
will be expressed to the Provost's Of
fice.
Committee member Colin Mi wa said
that "the decision is not decisive" and
that "any further conflict will be in

(the Provost's) office."
He added that various comments,
including the statement given by the
students from the march, will be in
cluded in the committee's recommen
dation.
In his recommendation to C-UAFA,
Huff cited rising costs as the principal
reason for increasing self-help. Costs
of financial aid for next year are ex
pected to be $1.9 million higher than
this year, according to Huff.
Of the $1.9 million, the University
hopes to get $600,000 by increasing
self-help, according to Huff. The self
help increase would cover 31.5 per
cent of the cost increase for these stu
dents, he said.
Additional money is expected to
come from an increase in tuition pay
ments and from an increase in outside
awards, grants or donations, said Huff.


Self-help spat

self-help requirement by $200. The recommendation
will go to the Provost's Office, which will forward it to the
Faculty Senate.
The proposed $200 increase in self
help expectations for students on fi
nancial aid was approved by a close
vote Friday at a meeting of the Com
mittee for Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids (C-UAFA).
The 5 to 4 vote on Director of Finan
cial Aids Robert Huff's recommenda
tion came after a two-hour meeting
which began with the appearance of
over 60 students who said they rep
resented "concerned black students
and minorities in general."
If approved by the Provost's Office
and the Faculty Senate, the $200 in
crease would apply to all those paying
self-help with the exception of enter
ing freshmen from the "low income"
category, whose self-help would in
crease by $100.
Self-help expectations are the
amounts of money that students must
pay toward their education and are
separate from the amount contributed
by the family or earned during the
summer months.
An increase in work-study wages is
expected to provide $50 of the self
help increase and the rest of the money
would be offered to the students in the
form of long term loans, said Huff.
A proposed amendment to Huff's re
commendation by Assoc. Education
Prof. Denis Phillips, which would
have set the self-help expectation at
$150, was defeated by a 5 to 4 vote.
According to C-UAFA student
member Edward Sosa, "the 60 stu
dents that came made a big impact on

the committee . . . without their ap
pearance there would have been only
30 minutes of discussion."
The spokesman for the marching
students, Warner Session, explained
that the students went to the meeting
because "we wanted to be in a position
of acting on it (change in self-help ex
pectations) before they voted rather
than react once the vote was taken."
Speaking before the C-UAFA mem
bers and the students that had
squeezed in to listen, Session said he
hoped the committee would consider
such things as a historically high un
employment rate for black college
youths during the summer months, the
"particular burden" for minority
seniors who have to apply to graduate
school and the fact that this would be
the second self-help change in two
years although there has not been a

comparable rise in the median income
of black and other minority families in
the country.
After the measure had passed, Ses
sion said that the students' efforts may
still keep the recommendation from
reaching final approval.
Session said the next step in com
municating the students' views will be
the formation of a task force represent
ing the entire minority community "to
deal with the problem in hand."
C-UAFA Chairman William Chace
