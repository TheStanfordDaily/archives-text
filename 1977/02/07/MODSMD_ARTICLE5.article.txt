# State may control research on DNA
## 
### Bonny Rodden 
The state Health Department would
have the authority to regulate recom
binant DNA research here under a
draft of a bill slated to go before the
state legislature, according to the San
Francisco Chronicle.
State health officials are seeking the
support of Gov. Edmund "Jerry"
Brown Jr. before sending the bill to the
legislature.
Brown is expected to back the bill,
the Chronicle reported Friday.
The provisions of the bill are more
restrictive than the National Institutrs
of Health (NIH) guidelines which the
University currently follows. The pro
visions would apply to DNA research
in private industries as well as in
nearly a dozen universities in Califor
nia.
Guggenheim Immunology Prof.
Halsted Holman praised the proposal
for including private companies,
which are currently independent of
NIH guidelines.
Holman said he was "in principle in
favor of public regulation" for such
controversial research being underta
ken in private companies or educa
tional institutions. However, he said

he could not comment on this specific
proposed legislation until he knew
how the Health Department proposed
to monitor the research.
Under the proposed law, researchers
and their laboratories would be in
spected regularly by state officials, ac
cording to the Chronicle.
Everyone involved in all aspects of
the research would be required to re
gister with the state. Industries and
universities which violate the law
would be fined up to $500 and could
be forced to close their laboratories.
Roland Finston, acting director of
health physics, said the proposed bill
would establish an unprecedented
amount of state control over such an
early phase of biological research.
He said the state regulates radioac
tive substances when the University
uses them in laboratories or on hu
mans for pharmaceutical purposes.
However, he said it is unprecedented
to have regulations when the research
is at such an early stage that the risks
are unknown.
"For research, inanimate or in vitro
(in glass tubes), I don't think there is a
parallel in the radioactive area,"
Finston said.
Finston said he agrees the public
should be made aware of the risks in
volved in recombinant DNA research.
He said the public should be allowed
to voice its opinion on what level of
risk it is willing to accept in exchange
for the benefits of the research.
"I am in favor of publfc participa
tion. But whether that is through the
state legislature remains to be seen,"
he said.
The proposal was originally drafted
by Marc Lappe of the state Health De
partment's Office of Health Law and
Values. It has been approved by the
state's health director but Brown's
legislative aides may still revise its
language.
Lappe wrote an article on DNA re
search entitled "Pulling Back from the
Apocalypse," which has been used as
background material for legislators
holding hearings on genetic research
during the past three weeks in Sac
ramento.

favor of public regulation" for such
controversial research being underta
ken in private companies or educa
tional institutions. However, he said

he could not comment on this specific
proposed legislation until he knew
how the Health Department proposed
to monitor the research.
Under the proposed law, researchers
and their laboratories would be in
spected regularly by state officials, ac
cording to the Chronicle.
Everyone involved in all aspects of
the research would be required to re
gister with the state. Industries and
universities which violate the law
would be fined up to $500 and could
be forced to close their laboratories.
Roland Finston, acting director of
health physics, said the proposed bill
would establish an unprecedented
amount of state control over such an
early phase of biological research.
He said the state regulates radioac
tive substances when the University
uses them in laboratories or on hu
mans for pharmaceutical purposes.
However, he said it is unprecedented
to have regulations when the research
is at such an early stage that the risks
are unknown.
"For research, inanimate or in vitro
(in glass tubes), I don't think there is a
parallel in the radioactive area,"
Finston said.
Finston said he agrees the public
should be made aware of the risks in
volved in recombinant DNA research.
He said the public should be allowed
to voice its opinion on what level of
risk it is willing to accept in exchange
for the benefits of the research.
"I am in favor of publfc participa
tion. But whether that is through the
state legislature remains to be seen,"
he said.
The proposal was originally drafted
by Marc Lappe of the state Health De
partment's Office of Health Law and
Values. It has been approved by the
state's health director but Brown's
legislative aides may still revise its
language.
Lappe wrote an article on DNA re
search entitled "Pulling Back from the
Apocalypse," which has been used as
background material for legislators
holding hearings on genetic research
during the past three weeks in Sac
ramento.
The state Health Department would
have the authority to regulate recom
binant DNA research here under a
draft of a bill slated to go before the
state legislature, according to the San
Francisco Chronicle.
State health officials are seeking the
support of Gov. Edmund "Jerry"
Brown Jr. before sending the bill to the
legislature.
Brown is expected to back the bill,
the Chronicle reported Friday.
The provisions of the bill are more
restrictive than the National Institutrs
of Health (NIH) guidelines which the
University currently follows. The pro
visions would apply to DNA research
in private industries as well as in
nearly a dozen universities in Califor
nia.
Guggenheim Immunology Prof.
Halsted Holman praised the proposal
for including private companies,
which are currently independent of
NIH guidelines.
Holman said he was "in principle in
favor of public regulation" for such
controversial research being underta
ken in private companies or educa
tional institutions. However, he said
