# Senators mull dropping Electoral College
## 
### Jordan Lorence News analysis 
Last week, the U.S. Senate Subcom
mittee on Constitutional Amendments
held hearings on a proposed amend
ment that would abolish the Electoral
College and provide for direct popular
election of the president.
One of the proposals, submitted by
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.), would call
for a runoff election between the top
two candidates if no candidate re
ceived over 40 per cent of the popular

vote. This same amendment passed
the House in 1969 by a vote of 339-70,
but was stopped by a filibuster in the
Senate.
Prof. Richard Brodv, chairman of the
Political Science Department, said he
thinks direct election would not result
in any major changes in the election
process.
"There would probably be a greater
emphasis during the campaign on
media," said Brody, "since a vote in
Casper, Wyo. would count as much as

one in New York City."
He also said that there would be
problems with the status of third par
ties.
Uniform requirements
"Since every state would be voting
for the same candidates, the federal
government would have to set uniform
requirements for getting on the bal
lot," said Brody. "What will happen to
third parties? Either the standards will
be so strict that we'd never see third
parties again or they will be so lax that

we'd have to let every kook in an Uncle
Sam suit on the ballot."
Electoral College reform has re
ceived much attention over the years
because of potentially dangerous de
ficiencies in the system.
"One problem is the states' practice
of awarding all its electoral votes to the
top vote-getter," said Political Science
Prof. Robert Horn. "This winner-take
all method is not required by the Con
stitution. It usually magnifies the
popular majority, but not always. In
1888, Benjamin Harrison defeated
Grover Cleveland in the Electoral Col
lege, although Harrison received
100,000 fewer votes than Cleveland."
Horn said that another difficult fea
ture with the present system is the
runoff election in the House of Rep
resentatives. Each state is allowed one
vote. The winner must receive a major
ity of the votes. That means that the 26
smallest states, with less than 20 per
cent of the nation's population, could
elect a president.
Furthermore, a state would have no
vote if the representatives from that
state could not agree on whom to sup
port.
This runoff system has been used
twice: once in 1800, when Thomas Jef
ferson and Aaron Burr tied in the Elec
toral College; and once in 1824, when
the House elected John Quincy
Adams, who placed second in the elec
toral vote behind Andrew Jackson.
Disputed votes
In 1876, Rutherford Hayes beat front
runner Samuel Tilden after a special
Electoral Commission awarded all of
22 disputed electoral votes to Hayes,
amid accusations of fraud and corrup
tion.
Horn said that there is also the prob
lem of the "faithless elector." Electors
are pledged, but not required, to sup
port a certain candidate. In recent
years, a few electors have switched
their votes. None of the switches has
ever changed the results of an election.
In 1976, a Republican elector from
Washington voted for Ronald Reagan
instead of Gerald Ford.
Both professors have no idea
whether the direct election amend
ment will become part of the Constitu
tion soon. But, they aren't that con
cerned about it.
As Prof. Horn said, "I don't think it
will matter that much if we retain the
old system or change it. The Republic
won't perish either way."

elect a president.
Furthermore, a state would have no
vote if the representatives from that
state could not agree on whom to sup
port.
This runoff system has been used
twice: once in 1800, when Thomas Jef
ferson and Aaron Burr tied in the Elec
toral College; and once in 1824, when
the House elected John Quincy
Adams, who placed second in the elec
toral vote behind Andrew Jackson.
Disputed votes
In 1876, Rutherford Hayes beat front
runner Samuel Tilden after a special
Electoral Commission awarded all of
22 disputed electoral votes to Hayes,
amid accusations of fraud and corrup
tion.
Horn said that there is also the prob
lem of the "faithless elector." Electors
are pledged, but not required, to sup
port a certain candidate. In recent
years, a few electors have switched
their votes. None of the switches has
ever changed the results of an election.
In 1976, a Republican elector from
Washington voted for Ronald Reagan
instead of Gerald Ford.
Both professors have no idea
whether the direct election amend
ment will become part of the Constitu
tion soon. But, they aren't that con
cerned about it.
As Prof. Horn said, "I don't think it
will matter that much if we retain the
old system or change it. The Republic
won't perish either way."
Last week, the U.S. Senate Subcom
mittee on Constitutional Amendments
held hearings on a proposed amend
ment that would abolish the Electoral
College and provide for direct popular
election of the president.
One of the proposals, submitted by
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.), would call
for a runoff election between the top
two candidates if no candidate re
ceived over 40 per cent of the popular

vote. This same amendment passed
the House in 1969 by a vote of 339-70,
but was stopped by a filibuster in the
Senate.
Prof. Richard Brodv, chairman of the
Political Science Department, said he
thinks direct election would not result
in any major changes in the election
process.
"There would probably be a greater
emphasis during the campaign on
media," said Brody, "since a vote in
Casper, Wyo. would count as much as

one in New York City."
He also said that there would be
problems with the status of third par
ties.
Uniform requirements
"Since every state would be voting
for the same candidates, the federal
government would have to set uniform
requirements for getting on the bal
lot," said Brody. "What will happen to
third parties? Either the standards will
be so strict that we'd never see third
parties again or they will be so lax that

we'd have to let every kook in an Uncle
Sam suit on the ballot."
Electoral College reform has re
ceived much attention over the years
because of potentially dangerous de
ficiencies in the system.
"One problem is the states' practice
of awarding all its electoral votes to the
top vote-getter," said Political Science
Prof. Robert Horn. "This winner-take
all method is not required by the Con
stitution. It usually magnifies the
popular majority, but not always. In
1888, Benjamin Harrison defeated
Grover Cleveland in the Electoral Col
lege, although Harrison received
100,000 fewer votes than Cleveland."
Horn said that another difficult fea
ture with the present system is the
runoff election in the House of Rep
resentatives. Each state is allowed one
vote. The winner must receive a major
ity of the votes. That means that the 26
smallest states, with less than 20 per
cent of the nation's population, could
elect a president.
Furthermore, a state would have no
vote if the representatives from that
state could not agree on whom to sup
port.
