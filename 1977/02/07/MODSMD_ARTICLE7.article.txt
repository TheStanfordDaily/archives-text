## Opinions More social life needed 
### 
The Opinions Page is initiating a new column entitled
"Graduate Record."Every two weeks, Deric Jennings and
Rick Hoft will discuss a topic of interest and concern to
graduate students.
Graduate students express frequent dissatisfaction with
the lack of campus social services directed toward their
interests. Many graduates would like to have more oppor
tunities to meet and develop friendships with students in
other graduate programs. Despite these commonly voiced
sentiments, no student organization orUniversity office has
yet specifically addressed this problem.
One reason why little action has been taken stems from an
incorrect extension of the correct view that graduates
should be treated differently than undergraduates. Of
course there should be relatively less use of the in loco
parentis doctrine that still applies to some aspects of un
dergraduate life, and a more laissez-faire approach to the
residential, social and academic education of graduate stu
dents.
Graduates are older than undergraduates. Graduates' in
terests are concentrated on more specific academic pur
suits. More graduate students are married, many have chil
dren and for these students, the dating game is no longer a
part of their lifestyle.
Beyond housing
But these considerations are erroneously translated into
the notion that graduates do not require many University

services beyond some housing and financial support and a
well-nurtured academic curriculum.
We do not deny the differences between undergraduates
and graduates, but they do not justify any limitation of the
mechanisms by which various segments of the Stanford
graduate community might communicate and socialize
with each other.
Even married students have voiced frustration with the
departmental isolation of Stanford graduates. Single
graduate students have a still greater need for regular social
activities and other opportunities to meet people outside
their own academic milieux. First-year grad students in
particular, arriving in a new place with few if any friends-,
often endure a painful and lonely period of adjustment to
Stanford's relatively barren social environment.
The situation is worsened by the fact that Palo Alto and its
environs are suburban, family-oriented towns that offer lit
tle excitement and few services for the typical student (as
compared to Berkeley, San Francisco or almost any other
urban center).
Unhappy adaptation
By the end of their first year most graduate students have
adapted to these peculiarities of Stanford life, but the con
tinued prevalence of complaints suggests that their adapta
tion may not always be a happy or complete one.
There are a few noteworthy exceptions to the general void
in extradepartmental graduate student activities on cam
pus. Bechtel International Center offers an exciting weekly
calendar of social and intellectual events and we strongly
encourage all graduate students to become familiar with its

programs. However, the scope of its activities is necessarily
limited and it cannot be expected to serve all the needs of
non-foreign graduate students.
The Escondido Village Council is involved in many on
going projects within the village, but its focus is almost
exclusively on Escondido residents and their domestic
concerns. Hence the council's influence on graduate stu
dents is self-limited in scope.
On-campus graduate housing in general has a tremend
ous potential for creating healthy social environments for
graduate students. The numerous problems and pos
sibilities associated with this situation will be reviewed at
length in a subsequent column.
Active planning
Many undergraduate activities are also open to
graduates, but this does not satisfy a grad student's desire to
interact with and learn from peers in other departments. We
suggest that Stanford students and officials work together
to implement the following ideas:
First, there should be an orientation week for entering
graduate students, which would introduce them to the
many facilities and resources available on the Stanford
campus and extend their awareness well beyond the
specific details of departmental academic programs. If
graduate students were better informed of available Univer
sity services and the opportunities for extra-curricular, in
volvement, they might find Stanford a far more amenable
place to do graduate work.
Second, more graduate student involvement is needed to
organize campus parties and other University-wide social
activities such as the Graduate Evening at Tresidder held
last October. Insufficient funding is a surmountable obsta
cle, but there must be more student participation if a regular
series of such events is to occur.
Third, a beer-and-wine pub should be established on
campus. It would provide a much-needed focal point for the
informal social and educational activities of graduates and
older undergaduates. Were junior and senior faculty and
staff to patronize such an establishment, it might also en
courage a more relaxed interaction among these usually
segregated groups.
Fourth, graduate students need a campus center or
lounge of their own where they can meet regularly with
their peers for lunch or other formal and informal events.
Such a facility would provide a central location for ac
tivities designed to bring graduates together from all over
the University.
Fifth, there is currently little intellectual communication
among graduate students in different disciplines, which
only compounds their sense of departmental isolation. In
terdisciplinary graduate seminars or discussion groups
would go a long way to counter this separateness, while
simultaneously providing opportunities to broaden the
scope of graduate education at Stanford by exposing stu
dents to previously inaccessible varieties of academic re
search.
These five suggestions are separable in fact, but are con
ceptually directed towards a single goal â€” to expand and
vitalize the social environment of Stanford graduate stu
dents. We graduates cannot simply lay back and wait for
Bliss to appear. We must actively present our concerns
before an increasingly sympathetic administration, if we
are ever to improve our situation.

The Opinions Page is initiating a new column entitled
"Graduate Record."Every two weeks, Deric Jennings and
Rick Hoft will discuss a topic of interest and concern to
graduate students.
Graduate students express frequent dissatisfaction with
the lack of campus social services directed toward their
interests. Many graduates would like to have more oppor
tunities to meet and develop friendships with students in
other graduate programs. Despite these commonly voiced
sentiments, no student organization orUniversity office has
yet specifically addressed this problem.
One reason why little action has been taken stems from an
incorrect extension of the correct view that graduates
should be treated differently than undergraduates. Of
course there should be relatively less use of the in loco
parentis doctrine that still applies to some aspects of un
dergraduate life, and a more laissez-faire approach to the
residential, social and academic education of graduate stu
dents.
Graduates are older than undergraduates. Graduates' in
terests are concentrated on more specific academic pur
suits. More graduate students are married, many have chil
dren and for these students, the dating game is no longer a
part of their lifestyle.
Beyond housing
But these considerations are erroneously translated into
the notion that graduates do not require many University

services beyond some housing and financial support and a
well-nurtured academic curriculum.
We do not deny the differences between undergraduates
and graduates, but they do not justify any limitation of the
mechanisms by which various segments of the Stanford
graduate community might communicate and socialize
with each other.
Even married students have voiced frustration with the
departmental isolation of Stanford graduates. Single
graduate students have a still greater need for regular social
activities and other opportunities to meet people outside
their own academic milieux. First-year grad students in
particular, arriving in a new place with few if any friends-,
often endure a painful and lonely period of adjustment to
Stanford's relatively barren social environment.
The situation is worsened by the fact that Palo Alto and its
environs are suburban, family-oriented towns that offer lit
tle excitement and few services for the typical student (as
compared to Berkeley, San Francisco or almost any other
urban center).
Unhappy adaptation
By the end of their first year most graduate students have
adapted to these peculiarities of Stanford life, but the con
tinued prevalence of complaints suggests that their adapta
tion may not always be a happy or complete one.
There are a few noteworthy exceptions to the general void
in extradepartmental graduate student activities on cam
pus. Bechtel International Center offers an exciting weekly
calendar of social and intellectual events and we strongly
encourage all graduate students to become familiar with its

programs. However, the scope of its activities is necessarily
limited and it cannot be expected to serve all the needs of
non-foreign graduate students.
The Escondido Village Council is involved in many on
going projects within the village, but its focus is almost
exclusively on Escondido residents and their domestic
concerns. Hence the council's influence on graduate stu
dents is self-limited in scope.
On-campus graduate housing in general has a tremend
ous potential for creating healthy social environments for
graduate students. The numerous problems and pos
sibilities associated with this situation will be reviewed at
length in a subsequent column.
Active planning
Many undergraduate activities are also open to
graduates, but this does not satisfy a grad student's desire to
interact with and learn from peers in other departments. We
suggest that Stanford students and officials work together
to implement the following ideas:
First, there should be an orientation week for entering
graduate students, which would introduce them to the
many facilities and resources available on the Stanford
campus and extend their awareness well beyond the
specific details of departmental academic programs. If
graduate students were better informed of available Univer
sity services and the opportunities for extra-curricular, in
volvement, they might find Stanford a far more amenable
place to do graduate work.
Second, more graduate student involvement is needed to
organize campus parties and other University-wide social
activities such as the Graduate Evening at Tresidder held
last October. Insufficient funding is a surmountable obsta
cle, but there must be more student participation if a regular
series of such events is to occur.
Third, a beer-and-wine pub should be established on
campus. It would provide a much-needed focal point for the
informal social and educational activities of graduates and
older undergaduates. Were junior and senior faculty and
staff to patronize such an establishment, it might also en
courage a more relaxed interaction among these usually
segregated groups.
Fourth, graduate students need a campus center or
lounge of their own where they can meet regularly with
their peers for lunch or other formal and informal events.
Such a facility would provide a central location for ac
tivities designed to bring graduates together from all over
the University.
Fifth, there is currently little intellectual communication
among graduate students in different disciplines, which
only compounds their sense of departmental isolation. In
terdisciplinary graduate seminars or discussion groups
would go a long way to counter this separateness, while
simultaneously providing opportunities to broaden the
scope of graduate education at Stanford by exposing stu
dents to previously inaccessible varieties of academic re
search.
These five suggestions are separable in fact, but are con
ceptually directed towards a single goal â€” to expand and
vitalize the social environment of Stanford graduate stu
dents. We graduates cannot simply lay back and wait for
Bliss to appear. We must actively present our concerns
before an increasingly sympathetic administration, if we
are ever to improve our situation.

are ever to improve our situation.

The Opinions Page is initiating a new column entitled
"Graduate Record."Every two weeks, Deric Jennings and
Rick Hoft will discuss a topic of interest and concern to
graduate students.
Graduate students express frequent dissatisfaction with
the lack of campus social services directed toward their
interests. Many graduates would like to have more oppor
tunities to meet and develop friendships with students in
other graduate programs. Despite these commonly voiced
sentiments, no student organization orUniversity office has
yet specifically addressed this problem.
One reason why little action has been taken stems from an
incorrect extension of the correct view that graduates
should be treated differently than undergraduates. Of
course there should be relatively less use of the in loco
parentis doctrine that still applies to some aspects of un
dergraduate life, and a more laissez-faire approach to the
residential, social and academic education of graduate stu
dents.
Graduates are older than undergraduates. Graduates' in
terests are concentrated on more specific academic pur
suits. More graduate students are married, many have chil
dren and for these students, the dating game is no longer a
part of their lifestyle.
Beyond housing
But these considerations are erroneously translated into
the notion that graduates do not require many University

services beyond some housing and financial support and a
well-nurtured academic curriculum.
We do not deny the differences between undergraduates
and graduates, but they do not justify any limitation of the
mechanisms by which various segments of the Stanford
graduate community might communicate and socialize
with each other.
Even married students have voiced frustration with the
departmental isolation of Stanford graduates. Single
graduate students have a still greater need for regular social
activities and other opportunities to meet people outside
their own academic milieux. First-year grad students in
particular, arriving in a new place with few if any friends-,
often endure a painful and lonely period of adjustment to
Stanford's relatively barren social environment.
The situation is worsened by the fact that Palo Alto and its
environs are suburban, family-oriented towns that offer lit
tle excitement and few services for the typical student (as
compared to Berkeley, San Francisco or almost any other
urban center).
Unhappy adaptation
By the end of their first year most graduate students have
adapted to these peculiarities of Stanford life, but the con
tinued prevalence of complaints suggests that their adapta
tion may not always be a happy or complete one.
There are a few noteworthy exceptions to the general void
in extradepartmental graduate student activities on cam
pus. Bechtel International Center offers an exciting weekly
calendar of social and intellectual events and we strongly
encourage all graduate students to become familiar with its

programs. However, the scope of its activities is necessarily
limited and it cannot be expected to serve all the needs of
non-foreign graduate students.
The Escondido Village Council is involved in many on
going projects within the village, but its focus is almost
exclusively on Escondido residents and their domestic
concerns. Hence the council's influence on graduate stu
dents is self-limited in scope.
On-campus graduate housing in general has a tremend
ous potential for creating healthy social environments for
graduate students. The numerous problems and pos
sibilities associated with this situation will be reviewed at
length in a subsequent column.
Active planning
Many undergraduate activities are also open to
graduates, but this does not satisfy a grad student's desire to
interact with and learn from peers in other departments. We
suggest that Stanford students and officials work together
to implement the following ideas:
First, there should be an orientation week for entering
graduate students, which would introduce them to the
many facilities and resources available on the Stanford
campus and extend their awareness well beyond the
specific details of departmental academic programs. If
graduate students were better informed of available Univer
sity services and the opportunities for extra-curricular, in
volvement, they might find Stanford a far more amenable
place to do graduate work.
Second, more graduate student involvement is needed to
organize campus parties and other University-wide social
activities such as the Graduate Evening at Tresidder held
last October. Insufficient funding is a surmountable obsta
cle, but there must be more student participation if a regular
series of such events is to occur.
Third, a beer-and-wine pub should be established on
campus. It would provide a much-needed focal point for the
informal social and educational activities of graduates and
older undergaduates. Were junior and senior faculty and
staff to patronize such an establishment, it might also en
courage a more relaxed interaction among these usually
segregated groups.
Fourth, graduate students need a campus center or
lounge of their own where they can meet regularly with
their peers for lunch or other formal and informal events.
Such a facility would provide a central location for ac
tivities designed to bring graduates together from all over
the University.
Fifth, there is currently little intellectual communication
among graduate students in different disciplines, which
only compounds their sense of departmental isolation. In
terdisciplinary graduate seminars or discussion groups
would go a long way to counter this separateness, while
simultaneously providing opportunities to broaden the
scope of graduate education at Stanford by exposing stu
dents to previously inaccessible varieties of academic re
search.
These five suggestions are separable in fact, but are con
ceptually directed towards a single goal â€” to expand and
vitalize the social environment of Stanford graduate stu
dents. We graduates cannot simply lay back and wait for
Bliss to appear. We must actively present our concerns
before an increasingly sympathetic administration, if we
are ever to improve our situation.
