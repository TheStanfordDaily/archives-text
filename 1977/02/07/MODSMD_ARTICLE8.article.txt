# Poverty takes everyone's money

Poverty is expensive.
What, you ask? Poverty is free. Isn't
the very nature of it based on lack of
money?
It is true that there is no admission
charge for entry into the ranks of the
poor. One can be born into poverty, or
thrust into it by misfortune. One can
even choose it by renouncing the
luxuries of the middle and upper clas
ses.
But poverty takes its toll, not only
upon those who must endure it, but
also upon those who blithely ignore it,
thinking it is none of their business.
Poverty is expensive, and each

member of this society pays for it
either in financial or in human terms.
It is current wisdom that povertj
contributed to crime, and it is
documented that many criminals are
from poverty-ridden backgrounds. Yel
this society lacks any real commitment
toward alleviating the conditions ol
poverty. It therefore seems to follow
that this society is also willing to ac
cept its high crime rate.
Can we then so easily afford the loss
of our citizens' lives, the property
which is stolen from us, the costly up
keep of our prisons, or the various re
habilitation programs for our criminal
populace? Can we so readily resign
ourselves to the financial burdens ol
lengthy trials, property compensation
and high insurance premiums?
What about poverty as it relates tc
other costs, such as welfare programs,
free medical care for the indigent and
compensatory education? Welfare
regulations often deter recipients from
going to work, simply because they dc
not have sufficient skills or training tc
allow them to earn as much as the>
could get from welfare. (Welfare pay
ments are terribly low, but work re

lated costs, such as clothing, transpor
tation and childcare, in addition to
normal living expenses, often leave
workers with less money each month
than welfare would give them.)
Free medical care has been a bles
sing to the poor, but it is costing the
rest of society plenty, especially with
the soaring costs of services and
medicines, aggravated by those doc
tors who charge for services never
rendered to patients.
Poor children, under the current
methods of school financing, usually
receive vastly inferior educations.
This requires public spending in com
pensatory education, and also contri
butes to the pool of "hard-core un
employables" whom welfare supports.
But financial burdens are not pover
ty's only cost to this society. Indigence
is just as hostile to human well-being
as it is to financial well-being.
The poor are faced with contradic
tory messages from the rest of the soci
ety. "Work hard," they are told, "and
you will succeed." But they are hand

icapped by inferior educations, re
jected by race or sex, consigned to live
out their lives in the lower class.
Examine the differences between
the poor and the rest of society.
While middle class and upper class
parents wonder if they can afford a
room full of nursery furniture, poor pa
rents wonder if the pregnant mother
will get proper food and prenatal care
to insure a live birth. Infant mortality
rate is highest among the poor.
While middle class and upper class
parents wonder whether to send their
children to art school or give them bal
let lessons, poor parents wonder if
their children will ever manage to
learn to read.
While middle class and upper class
parents wonder which college their
children will attend, poor parents can
only hope that their children will
graduate from high school, and not
turn to drug addiction or crime.
The poor know what the rest of the
society likes to deny â€” that poverty is
based upon depriving one for the be

nefit of another, that poverty is nearly
inescapable and deliberately so, and
that this society does not have, nor
does it seem to intend to have, a firm
commitment to ending poverty in the
future.
Poverty is an expensive proposition.
It twists human creativity into crimi
nal ingenuity. It produces despair
which finds release in violence. It
squanders ability and wastes human
energy. Its most insidious evil is the
way in which it permits one portion of
this society to despise another.
And it costs money.
We need a new, aggressive approach
to the problems of poverty. We must
see to it that every person receives a
good education. We must insure that
jobs are created which will utilize the
talents and abilities of all members of
society. Above all, the doors to oppor
tunity must be open to everyone.
Because poverty hurts everyone.
