# Equal under the law

Readers have had the opportunity to read several essays
on this page that analyze and reject the recent Bakke deci
sion that ruled against special college admission programs
for students who are members of racial minority groups.
The Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the 1964
Civil Rights Act prohibit discrimination on the basis of race.
At the time that these were enacted, the driving force be
hind them was the eradication of cruel and humiliating
practices that were based on racist beliefs and were offi
cially sanctioned by local, state, and the federal govern
ments up to that time. Few legislators foresaw the possibil
ity that non-minoritv groups would ever be discriminated
against solely on the basis of their skin cojor, and this
probably did not enter into any part of the decision-making
process. Yet, these acts of Congress are law, and all citizens
are entitled to equal protection under the law, and there
fore, discrimination against white students in admission
procedures is illegal.
The attempt to admit larger numbers of minority students
into higher education and professional schools is due to the
fact that these groups, on the average, are economically and
educationally disadvantaged for many reasons. There is no
assumption that peopleofcolorare inherently less talented,
and therefore require "lenience" so that they may achieve
high educational levels. This would be a racist assumption

indeed! So minority students are not admitted solely be
cause they are minorities, but because, on the average, they
are poorer and less educated than the competing group of
white students.
If economics and educational background are the original
bases of special admissions programs, then why is there sch
vehement opposition to Bakke? While differentiation on
the basis of race has no logical or fair defense behind it,
special consideration of other factors in an applicant's
background can be shown to be very important in explain
ing a less than outstanding record on college board exams
and grades.
Factors such as quality of previous schools, illnesses,
family problems, and economic difficulties are important in
the cases of minority and white students alike, and minority
students will often be able to request special consideration
on the basis of these factors, and will therefore still be
admitted in comparable numbers.
The difference will be that disadvantaged white students
will be given equally special consideration, and non
disadvantaged minority students will not be allowed to
abuse the programs as sometimes happens under the cur
rent umbrella policies.
