a lot of the Continent. Trains are fast, comfortable, frequent And they speed you to the heart of cities.
Stations are like small towns with everything a traveler needs. You meet fellow
backpackers (Europeans, too). You can sleep on board; couchettes are bargains Your Student-Railpass
even covers some ferry steamer and motorcoach rides Best of all with the Pass you can stay loose,
park where you like, move on at whim. There's always another train you can catch.
To get a Student-Railpass you have to be a full-time student under 26. Both Student-Railpass
and Eurailpass are sold here through your Travel Agent . You can't buy them in Europe
If you've less than or more than two months, get a Eurailpass. Same idea but you ride First Class.
Available in two or three-week Passes, or one, two, or three-month Passes.
If you're not about to enlist why not plan to see Europe with a Student-Railpass.
No, you won't have to pass a physical.
