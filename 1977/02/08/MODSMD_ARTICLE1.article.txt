# 'Boys neater now'
## 'Moms' clean up 
### Sue Lesjak 
Every weekday in the dorms, they
polish furniture, vacuum carpets and
mop bathroom floors. Forty custo
dians, most ot whom have worked for
the University for 10 or 15 years,
clean Stanford's student residences.
Most say they enjoy working
around students.
"Everybody is nice — just like my
own children," says Sawae Jefferson,
a cleaning woman. "In Naranja they
call me 'little mom.' Everybody hugs
me — boys, girls, I hug everyone."
Carrie Funderburk, who works in
Ujamaa, echoes Jefferson's senti
ments.
"One of the reasons I work here,"
she explains, "is that I get to know
the kids. They are all very nice —
they obey you."
But Jefferson says some students
don't care for working people.
"When they see you just mopped
the bathroom floor, they come right
in and walk on it anyway. If I catch
them, I tell them right away," she
says. Most students listen to her.
Funderburk agrees that students
are usually polite and attentive . . .
"or else I hit them over the head with
a mop," she chuckles.
Lucille Maravilla, assistant man
ager of residences — housekeeping
service, describes University custo
dians as highly competent.
Are students messy?
Mary Powell, Soto custodian, says
student slovenliness is not a prob
lem. She doesn't "get after" her stu
dents. She feels it is her job to clean
up after them.
Gladys Anderson, Trancos house
keeper, says she thinks today's stu

dents are tidier than those of the past.
"Wilbur used to be all boys. It's a
lot neater since it went coed."
The boys "were something else,"
Powell says. "1 came in one day and
found a grand piano on the third
floor. 1 still don't know how they got
it up there."
"The boys are neater now 'cause
they want to make a good impression
on the girls," concludes Powell.
Jefferson, an employe here for 15
years, contends students today are
sloppier. She attributes the change to
the elimination of the house mothers
Lagunita houses once had.
"Kids weren't allowed to be messy
then," she says. "Today's RAs (house
associates) don't have the control
over students that house mothers
previously had."
Jefferson recalls when she came
here in 1962, "Students didn't have
long hair — they were really nice —
no drinking. They wore ties to class
all week. They are much harder
workers now. though."
Anderson describes the "smashing
and breaking" period of the 19605.
"It was pretty bad," she says, "but it
never affected us directly. The kids
were always pleasant to us."
"Students are not as bad as they're
painted at times," Powell comments.
"You don't hear swearing as much
as you used to." says Anderson. "You
become immune to it after awhile."
"But the things they write in the
men's bathroom!" exclaims Ander
son. "You scrub and scrub and still
can't get it off."
"You should go in sometime,"
suggests Powell, "you'd get an edu
cation."

Clean sweep
This 'dormkeeper' is just one of 40 custodians employed by the Univer
sity to help keep student residences clean and shiny. Here, Sawae
Jefferson tidies up by vacuuming the halls of Ujamaa.
Every weekday in the dorms, they
polish furniture, vacuum carpets and
mop bathroom floors. Forty custo
dians, most ot whom have worked for
the University for 10 or 15 years,
clean Stanford's student residences.
Most say they enjoy working
around students.
"Everybody is nice — just like my
own children," says Sawae Jefferson,
a cleaning woman. "In Naranja they
call me 'little mom.' Everybody hugs
me — boys, girls, I hug everyone."
Carrie Funderburk, who works in
Ujamaa, echoes Jefferson's senti
ments.
"One of the reasons I work here,"
she explains, "is that I get to know
the kids. They are all very nice —
they obey you."
But Jefferson says some students
don't care for working people.
"When they see you just mopped
the bathroom floor, they come right
in and walk on it anyway. If I catch
them, I tell them right away," she
says. Most students listen to her.
Funderburk agrees that students
are usually polite and attentive . . .
"or else I hit them over the head with
a mop," she chuckles.
Lucille Maravilla, assistant man
ager of residences — housekeeping
service, describes University custo
dians as highly competent.
Are students messy?
Mary Powell, Soto custodian, says
student slovenliness is not a prob
lem. She doesn't "get after" her stu
dents. She feels it is her job to clean
up after them.
Gladys Anderson, Trancos house
keeper, says she thinks today's stu

dents are tidier than those of the past.
"Wilbur used to be all boys. It's a
lot neater since it went coed."
The boys "were something else,"
Powell says. "1 came in one day and
found a grand piano on the third
floor. 1 still don't know how they got
it up there."
"The boys are neater now 'cause
they want to make a good impression
on the girls," concludes Powell.
Jefferson, an employe here for 15
years, contends students today are
sloppier. She attributes the change to
the elimination of the house mothers
Lagunita houses once had.
"Kids weren't allowed to be messy
then," she says. "Today's RAs (house
associates) don't have the control
over students that house mothers
previously had."
Jefferson recalls when she came
here in 1962, "Students didn't have
long hair — they were really nice —
no drinking. They wore ties to class
all week. They are much harder
workers now. though."
Anderson describes the "smashing
and breaking" period of the 19605.
"It was pretty bad," she says, "but it
never affected us directly. The kids
were always pleasant to us."
"Students are not as bad as they're
painted at times," Powell comments.
"You don't hear swearing as much
as you used to." says Anderson. "You
become immune to it after awhile."
"But the things they write in the
men's bathroom!" exclaims Ander
son. "You scrub and scrub and still
can't get it off."
"You should go in sometime,"
suggests Powell, "you'd get an edu
cation."
