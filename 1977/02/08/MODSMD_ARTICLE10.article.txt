Woman's role
Apparently Abigail Roeder does not
approve of the recent trend toward
equal marriage. It is inferred from her
Feb. 4 Opinions article, "Woman's
place is in the home," that woman
must bear the sole responsibility of
raising children simply because man
finds the task unpleasant.
However, the issue here is not this
example of subordination of female
will, but rather Roeder's implication
that a woman's only true purpose in
life is child-rearing, any alternative
aspirations being indicative of a shirk
ing of responsibility.
Certainly, the reader must recognize
that, were all women to follow
Roeder's advice, Zero Population
Growth would be completely under
mined as we contributed blindly to the
disastrous overpopulation of the earth.
Yes, motherhood is an admirable and
rewarding career which many Stan
ford women may one day pursue.
Nonetheless, women must have the
good sense to weigh the pros and cons
before making their decisions regard
ing child-bearing, viewing mother
hood not as an unsought responsibil
ity, but as a career choice.

From Marc Strassman's article (Jan.

31) on recombinant DNA research, I
quote: . . science bestowed on hu
manity hydrogen bombs, thalidomide,
polyvinyl chloride and televi
sion. . .
It is noteworthy that:
—no scientist has ever ordered the
construction or use of a thermonuclear
weapons arsenal:
—no scientists has ever manufac
tured, sold or prescribed thalidomide
to the public;
—no scientist is responsible in any
way for the content (objectionable or
otherwise) of television programming.
To put it another way, is Gutenberg
responsible for Mein Kampf? The con
venient castigation by "humanists" of
scientists for the ills of the modern
world ignores the fact that these ills are
social and political. Whether a dirty
deed is done with an axe or a laser, has
little relevance to the human context;
in all cases technology (and indeed all
human knowledge) is used, or abused,
by people of all occupations acting in a
social or political frame.
I would suggest therefore to
Strassman that he direct his concern
toward the politicians and other hol
ders of authority who actually use (or
propose to use) technological devices
to human detriment, rather than at
tacking science, whose goal it is to dis
cover those fundamental principles of
nature which, if understood, would
give us the ability to live more ration
ally, and perhaps even more peace

ably.

Isn't it rather strange to blame the 17
per cent increase in bike thefts on
"poor safety measures" such as
"poorly locked bikes and poorly de
signed racks?" Where does human
greed, or covetousness or just plain
old fashioned sin fit in?

Regarding Jon Barth's letter which
suggested that Hammarskjold house
be converted into an ASSU-sponsored
massage parlor, we the residents of
Hammarskjold feel, in a sense, that we
have been rubbed the wrong way.
We resent the unsolicited advertis
ing from such sources as the editorial
page of the Daily, as we have all the
business we can handleand don't wish
to be swamped by lecherous students
(no matter what the price) lured to our
door by indiscrete and unrestrained
publicity. After all, it's quality, not
quantity, that we feel highlights our
community in Hammarskjold. If we
are hit by this barrage of massage
hungry students, we will find ourse
lves obliged to add to our staff. Our

small house is barely large enough as it
is to house our select group of interna
tional masseuses/masseurs.

The reviewer of AppJause seems to
have wanted to call the hairdresser in
the play a faggot. A little reflection told
her that that blunt term might be offen

the one word with the closing sound of
the other: "fey."
Kennedy's coy coinage will be wel

From Marc Strassman's article (Jan.

31) on recombinant DNA research, I
quote: . . science bestowed on hu
manity hydrogen bombs, thalidomide,
polyvinyl chloride and televi
sion. . .
It is noteworthy that:
—no scientist has ever ordered the
construction or use of a thermonuclear
weapons arsenal:
—no scientists has ever manufac
tured, sold or prescribed thalidomide
to the public;
—no scientist is responsible in any
way for the content (objectionable or
otherwise) of television programming.
To put it another way, is Gutenberg
responsible for Mein Kampf? The con
venient castigation by "humanists" of
scientists for the ills of the modern
world ignores the fact that these ills are
social and political. Whether a dirty
deed is done with an axe or a laser, has
little relevance to the human context;
in all cases technology (and indeed all
human knowledge) is used, or abused,
by people of all occupations acting in a
social or political frame.
I would suggest therefore to
Strassman that he direct his concern
toward the politicians and other hol
ders of authority who actually use (or
propose to use) technological devices
to human detriment, rather than at
tacking science, whose goal it is to dis
cover those fundamental principles of
nature which, if understood, would
give us the ability to live more ration
ally, and perhaps even more peace

ably.
