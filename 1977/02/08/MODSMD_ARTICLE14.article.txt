## dance/Julianne Koehne Prokofiev transformed 
### 
The return of the San Fran
cisco Ballet Company's Borneo
unci Juliet is especially impor
tant because it is the first time an
American has choreographed a
version for an American com
pany using Prokofiev's full
length score.
Completed in 1935, Pro
kofiev's score was so violently
colorful that the Kirov first
deemed it undanceable. Finally
in 1940, the Kirov presented a
full-length work with Galina
Ulanova as Juliet; since then the
Bolshoi has used the music and
in 1962, John Cranko choreg
raphed the work on Marcia
Haydee and Richard Cragun of
the Stuttgart.
Kenneth MacMillan's produc
tion for the Royal Ballet is
perhaps the most well-known:
he modeled Juliet on Lynn
Seymour, and subsequently a
movie was made with Margot
Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.
San Francisco's version of
Homeo and Juliet was rated two
Dunce Magazine covers in the
last six months and therefore
seems strong enough to be ap
praised with the other works that
share Prokofiev's score.
Michael Smuin, co-director of
the San Francisco Ballet,
choreographed the balcony,
bedchamber, and tomb scenes in

1975, and last season presented
the full-length version without
complete sets, for financial
reasons.
Ballroom scene
In the ballroom scene, Pro
kofiev's weightiness is misin
terpreted; the complacent
haughtiness of the nobility
(danced with a smug, pelvic
swing in MacMillan's effective
scene), is replaced with an ab
surdly childish martiality that
makes the stomping guests look
like the fearsome Veronese civic
guard bearing down on us.
His love scenes are more
exuberantly youthful than the
Royal's and his choreography
more complex and less melo
dramatic than the Bolshoi's, but
the pace of the ballet could have
been quickened if some of the
marketplace merrymaking had
been cut.
Smuin's most marked changes
concern the care with which he
rounded out the implications of
the other characters' relation
ships: Mercutio loves Romeo
with "more than brotherly love;"
Lord Capulet likes Rosaline, and
Lady Capulet is having an affair
with her nephew, Tybalt. How
ever, the scene in which Lady
Capulet shares the caresses of
both Tybalt and Lord Capulet
unintentionally produces snick
ers from the audience; the
physical entanglements of their
menage a trois are overdrawn and
become stale caricatures.
Pleasant dancer
Betsy Erickson, as Rosaline,
the object of Romeo's initial in
fatuation, opens the ballet — she
dances a little too pleasantly,
like a dancer who would never
wear red to ballet class or do an
unmusical pirouette. But she is
really too nice a person to go un
noticed on stage: if she trusts her
instinctively refined taste, she

will never be athletically osten
tatious.
On the other hand, Attila Fic
zere has the showmanship she
misses and what he lacks in
technique, he makes up for in
excitement. He dances with a
dramatic intensity suitable to the
violence of 15th-century Italy,
and the audience loves him.
In an interview published in
the January. 1977 issue of Dance
Magazine, Ficzere, who de
fected from Hungary in 1969,
says of his schooling: "We were
not only trained to dance — we
were educated for the theater.
We had a classical academic
education (something that I con
sider an absolute necessity for
the dancer and the actor) and we
had a working knowledge, from
childhood, of theater."
Sweet freshness
Lynda Meyer dances Juliet
with a sweet freshness and
gradual maturation that makes
her portrayal full-bodied and
convincing. When she initially
meets Romeo, she does not over
play her youth; she is, after all,
the daughter of sophisticated
nobility. She dances with rap
turous innocence, smiling a sec
ret smile to herself, but when she
catches Romeo's eye again, she
stops smiling for just a second —
she does not want to appear too
young in this man's eyes.
Vane West, as Romeo, lacks
the necessary stage command to
dance a spoiled, impetuous
youth; neither is the control of
his long legs and feet strong
enough for the litheness and
grace of a young nobleman.
Perhaps he purposely em
phasizes Romeo's gangling
naivete; Smuin has continu
ously emphasized the compara
tive youth of the dancers in San
Francisco's production of
Romeo and Juliet. However, por
traying youthful characters takes
a more mature viewpoint; it
takes a woman, like Meyer (or
Seymour) to realize the identity
of a girl.

mance of "Romeo 8- Juliet" will
be Friday, Feb. 18 al Zellerbach
Auditorium, U.C. Berkeley. Call

Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.
San Francisco's version of
Homeo and Juliet was rated two
Dunce Magazine covers in the
last six months and therefore
seems strong enough to be ap
praised with the other works that
share Prokofiev's score.
Michael Smuin, co-director of
the San Francisco Ballet,
choreographed the balcony,
bedchamber, and tomb scenes in

1975, and last season presented
the full-length version without
complete sets, for financial
reasons.
Ballroom scene
In the ballroom scene, Pro
kofiev's weightiness is misin
terpreted; the complacent
haughtiness of the nobility
(danced with a smug, pelvic
swing in MacMillan's effective
scene), is replaced with an ab
surdly childish martiality that
makes the stomping guests look
like the fearsome Veronese civic
guard bearing down on us.
His love scenes are more
exuberantly youthful than the
Royal's and his choreography
more complex and less melo
dramatic than the Bolshoi's, but
the pace of the ballet could have
been quickened if some of the
marketplace merrymaking had
been cut.
Smuin's most marked changes
concern the care with which he
rounded out the implications of
the other characters' relation
ships: Mercutio loves Romeo
with "more than brotherly love;"
Lord Capulet likes Rosaline, and
Lady Capulet is having an affair
with her nephew, Tybalt. How
ever, the scene in which Lady
Capulet shares the caresses of
both Tybalt and Lord Capulet
unintentionally produces snick
ers from the audience; the
physical entanglements of their
menage a trois are overdrawn and
become stale caricatures.
Pleasant dancer
Betsy Erickson, as Rosaline,
the object of Romeo's initial in
fatuation, opens the ballet — she
dances a little too pleasantly,
like a dancer who would never
wear red to ballet class or do an
unmusical pirouette. But she is
really too nice a person to go un
noticed on stage: if she trusts her
instinctively refined taste, she

will never be athletically osten
tatious.
On the other hand, Attila Fic
zere has the showmanship she
misses and what he lacks in
technique, he makes up for in
excitement. He dances with a
dramatic intensity suitable to the
violence of 15th-century Italy,
and the audience loves him.
In an interview published in
the January. 1977 issue of Dance
Magazine, Ficzere, who de
fected from Hungary in 1969,
says of his schooling: "We were
not only trained to dance — we
were educated for the theater.
We had a classical academic
education (something that I con
sider an absolute necessity for
the dancer and the actor) and we
had a working knowledge, from
childhood, of theater."
Sweet freshness
Lynda Meyer dances Juliet
with a sweet freshness and
gradual maturation that makes
her portrayal full-bodied and
convincing. When she initially
meets Romeo, she does not over
play her youth; she is, after all,
the daughter of sophisticated
nobility. She dances with rap
turous innocence, smiling a sec
ret smile to herself, but when she
catches Romeo's eye again, she
stops smiling for just a second —
she does not want to appear too
young in this man's eyes.
Vane West, as Romeo, lacks
the necessary stage command to
dance a spoiled, impetuous
youth; neither is the control of
his long legs and feet strong
enough for the litheness and
grace of a young nobleman.
Perhaps he purposely em
phasizes Romeo's gangling
naivete; Smuin has continu
ously emphasized the compara
tive youth of the dancers in San
Francisco's production of
Romeo and Juliet. However, por
traying youthful characters takes
a more mature viewpoint; it
takes a woman, like Meyer (or
Seymour) to realize the identity
of a girl.

The return of the San Fran
cisco Ballet Company's Borneo
unci Juliet is especially impor
tant because it is the first time an
American has choreographed a
version for an American com
pany using Prokofiev's full
length score.
Completed in 1935, Pro
kofiev's score was so violently
colorful that the Kirov first
deemed it undanceable. Finally
in 1940, the Kirov presented a
full-length work with Galina
Ulanova as Juliet; since then the
Bolshoi has used the music and
in 1962, John Cranko choreg
raphed the work on Marcia
Haydee and Richard Cragun of
the Stuttgart.
Kenneth MacMillan's produc
tion for the Royal Ballet is
perhaps the most well-known:
he modeled Juliet on Lynn
Seymour, and subsequently a
movie was made with Margot
Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.

exuberantly youthful than the
Royal's and his choreography
more complex and less melo
dramatic than the Bolshoi's, but
the pace of the ballet could have
been quickened if some of the
marketplace merrymaking had
been cut.
Smuin's most marked changes
concern the care with which he
rounded out the implications of
the other characters' relation
ships: Mercutio loves Romeo
with "more than brotherly love;"
Lord Capulet likes Rosaline, and
Lady Capulet is having an affair
with her nephew, Tybalt. How
ever, the scene in which Lady
Capulet shares the caresses of
both Tybalt and Lord Capulet
unintentionally produces snick
ers from the audience; the
physical entanglements of their
menage a trois are overdrawn and
become stale caricatures.
Pleasant dancer
Betsy Erickson, as Rosaline,
the object of Romeo's initial in
fatuation, opens the ballet — she
dances a little too pleasantly,
like a dancer who would never
wear red to ballet class or do an
unmusical pirouette. But she is
really too nice a person to go un
noticed on stage: if she trusts her
instinctively refined taste, she

will never be athletically osten
tatious.
On the other hand, Attila Fic
zere has the showmanship she
misses and what he lacks in
technique, he makes up for in
excitement. He dances with a
dramatic intensity suitable to the
violence of 15th-century Italy,
and the audience loves him.
In an interview published in
the January. 1977 issue of Dance
Magazine, Ficzere, who de
fected from Hungary in 1969,
says of his schooling: "We were
not only trained to dance — we
were educated for the theater.
We had a classical academic
education (something that I con
sider an absolute necessity for
the dancer and the actor) and we
had a working knowledge, from
childhood, of theater."
Sweet freshness
Lynda Meyer dances Juliet
with a sweet freshness and
gradual maturation that makes
her portrayal full-bodied and
convincing. When she initially
meets Romeo, she does not over
play her youth; she is, after all,
the daughter of sophisticated
nobility. She dances with rap
turous innocence, smiling a sec
ret smile to herself, but when she
catches Romeo's eye again, she
stops smiling for just a second —
she does not want to appear too
young in this man's eyes.
Vane West, as Romeo, lacks
the necessary stage command to
dance a spoiled, impetuous
youth; neither is the control of
his long legs and feet strong
enough for the litheness and
grace of a young nobleman.
Perhaps he purposely em
phasizes Romeo's gangling
naivete; Smuin has continu
ously emphasized the compara
tive youth of the dancers in San
Francisco's production of
Romeo and Juliet. However, por
traying youthful characters takes
a more mature viewpoint; it
takes a woman, like Meyer (or
Seymour) to realize the identity
of a girl.

The return of the San Fran
cisco Ballet Company's Borneo
unci Juliet is especially impor
tant because it is the first time an
American has choreographed a
version for an American com
pany using Prokofiev's full
length score.
Completed in 1935, Pro
kofiev's score was so violently
colorful that the Kirov first
deemed it undanceable. Finally
in 1940, the Kirov presented a
full-length work with Galina
Ulanova as Juliet; since then the
Bolshoi has used the music and
in 1962, John Cranko choreg
raphed the work on Marcia
Haydee and Richard Cragun of
the Stuttgart.
Kenneth MacMillan's produc
tion for the Royal Ballet is
perhaps the most well-known:
he modeled Juliet on Lynn
Seymour, and subsequently a
movie was made with Margot
Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.
San Francisco's version of
Homeo and Juliet was rated two
Dunce Magazine covers in the
last six months and therefore
seems strong enough to be ap
praised with the other works that
share Prokofiev's score.
Michael Smuin, co-director of
the San Francisco Ballet,
choreographed the balcony,
bedchamber, and tomb scenes in

1975, and last season presented
the full-length version without
complete sets, for financial
reasons.
Ballroom scene
In the ballroom scene, Pro
kofiev's weightiness is misin
terpreted; the complacent
haughtiness of the nobility
(danced with a smug, pelvic
swing in MacMillan's effective
scene), is replaced with an ab
surdly childish martiality that
makes the stomping guests look
like the fearsome Veronese civic
guard bearing down on us.
