## X-rated filmmaker is a family man 
### 
Ralph Bakshi, director of the
animated features Fritz the Cat,
Heavy Traffic and now Wizards,
comes across as a contradiction
both in terms and in conversa
tion. He progresses from a sly,
subtle, deadpan humor to an in
tense philosophical stance, often
in the same paragraph.
He calls himself a pessimist,
yet his new movie is peopled by
dwarves and fairies. His aims up
until Wizards have been X-rated
and R-rated, yet he admits that
with two boys and two girls and
15 years of marriage. "1 am about
as straight a family man as you'll
find."
So which is the real Ralph
Bakshi? The one that spends the
hours between six a.m. and
seven p.m. at his animation
studio in Hollywood directing
films that take two years? Or the
one who insists. "1 can't lose all
touch with reality" and does oil
paintings reminiscent of Edwin
Hopper's in his spare time?
Not a schizo
Bakshi isn't schizophrenic, as
far as I could tell over the lunch
table, but I think perhaps each of
his attitudes balances another, as
if he feels compelled to con
stantly moderate the ingredients
of his life.
The X-rated films, beginning
with Fritz The Cat in 1972, were

perhaps a counter-reaction to his
years at Terrytoons as one of the
highest-paid animators in New
York City. "You know the kind
— cat chases mouse; cat catches
mouse; cat opens mouth to eat
mouse; mouse puts firecracker
in cat's mouth; firecracker
explodes; cat smiles; cat's teeth
fall out. It was driving me to
drink."
But, after five years in the
animated feature film business
— the only director so employed
despite his success and Hol
lywood's nasty habit of imitation
— his reaction runs in the direc
tion of pessimism again. "You
can't win in our business. You
do what you can when you can."
He does fantasy films because
"that's my escape. People who
are into fantasy want to escape
what's happening. What's hap
pening sucks."
'The Lord of the Rings'
And while Bakshi talks dis
paragingly of the past, he paints
the future like a frame from
Wizards, awash with vivid col
ors and striking scenery. He ap
proaches his future projects with
a brazen intensity, even though
failure at a certain trio of them
could mean certain lynching at
the hands of the literary world.
Having purchased the rights
from theauthor's son and daugh

ter, Bakshi is animating the
J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy. The Lord
of the Rings.
Three pictures, one from each
book of the trilogy, have been
budgeted at fifteen million dol
lars apiece. Wizards, while
polished and classy, only cost
four million. Quadrupling that is
going to bankroll quite an ex
travaganza.
Asked about the characters'
appearances, he says"The Tol
kien calendar's wrong." He addf
in his characteristic balancing
way that "everyone seems to
have loved it—" and then re
flects that with. " —but I've
shown it to very few people."
However, Bakshi is unper
turbed.
"I'm going to do it perfect!" he
promises, noting the employ
ment of the voices of Laurence
Olivier and Ralph Richardson,
among other British actors. "I'll
do the pictures better than the
books. Movies are more power
ful than print — if it's done right,
it'll work."
Animated Kafka?
Beyond that, Bakshi has plans
to animate Franz Kafka's The
Penal Colony, drawn by Maurice
Sendak, who illustrated Where
The Wild Things Are. "It's not
going to make a penny," Bakshi
says confidently, "but we're
going to do it."
Amid his articulate
philosophizing on animation

("It's far superior to live action"),
writers' relationships with di
rectors, and his pessimism to
ward the past and his optimism
toward the future (or was it the
other way around?), we even de
dicated a few words to Wizards.
"This will be my biggest
film," he said proudly. "1
wanted to extend my audience. 1
wanted to do animation without
sex. I did six city films, and I
decided 1 wanted to do some
thing else. I love fantasy —you
can't grow up as an artist and nut
love fantasy. I wanted to 4°
something in that genre."
And while the basic crisis was
between the powers of technol
ogy and the powers of magic,
Bakshi insists there was no im
plicit message. "I tried to just let
the audience have a good time.
It's both a tribute and a parody.
The tribute comes from the love,
and the parody comes from my
having fun with them, But it was
not a bitter parody."
He loves the game. He haj#s
the game. His animation eimr~
nates fantasy. His animation
reeks of reality. He's out to get
what he can while he can. He's
determined to create the perfect
visualization of The Lord OfThe
Rings. Perhaps that's where his
talent comes from — his ability
to see and understand both sides
to a question, to know that the
bottle can be both half-full and
half-empty at the same time.

from theauthor's son and daugh

ter, Bakshi is animating the
J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy. The Lord
of the Rings.
Three pictures, one from each
book of the trilogy, have been
budgeted at fifteen million dol
lars apiece. Wizards, while
polished and classy, only cost
four million. Quadrupling that is
going to bankroll quite an ex
travaganza.
Asked about the characters'
appearances, he says"The Tol
kien calendar's wrong." He addf
in his characteristic balancing
way that "everyone seems to
have loved it—" and then re
flects that with. " —but I've
shown it to very few people."
However, Bakshi is unper
turbed.
"I'm going to do it perfect!" he
promises, noting the employ
ment of the voices of Laurence
Olivier and Ralph Richardson,
among other British actors. "I'll
do the pictures better than the
books. Movies are more power
ful than print — if it's done right,
it'll work."
Animated Kafka?
Beyond that, Bakshi has plans
to animate Franz Kafka's The
Penal Colony, drawn by Maurice
Sendak, who illustrated Where
The Wild Things Are. "It's not
going to make a penny," Bakshi
says confidently, "but we're
going to do it."
Amid his articulate
philosophizing on animation

("It's far superior to live action"),
writers' relationships with di
rectors, and his pessimism to
ward the past and his optimism
toward the future (or was it the
other way around?), we even de
dicated a few words to Wizards.
"This will be my biggest
film," he said proudly. "1
wanted to extend my audience. 1
wanted to do animation without
sex. I did six city films, and I
decided 1 wanted to do some
thing else. I love fantasy —you
can't grow up as an artist and nut
love fantasy. I wanted to 4°
something in that genre."
And while the basic crisis was
between the powers of technol
ogy and the powers of magic,
Bakshi insists there was no im
plicit message. "I tried to just let
the audience have a good time.
It's both a tribute and a parody.
The tribute comes from the love,
and the parody comes from my
having fun with them, But it was
not a bitter parody."
He loves the game. He haj#s
the game. His animation eimr~
nates fantasy. His animation
reeks of reality. He's out to get
what he can while he can. He's
determined to create the perfect
visualization of The Lord OfThe
Rings. Perhaps that's where his
talent comes from — his ability
to see and understand both sides
to a question, to know that the
bottle can be both half-full and
half-empty at the same time.

Bakshi, a self-avowed pessimist, has nevertheless produced a
film populated by good fairies and dwarfs, albeit also evil goblins.
Ralph Bakshi, director of the
animated features Fritz the Cat,
Heavy Traffic and now Wizards,
comes across as a contradiction
both in terms and in conversa
tion. He progresses from a sly,
subtle, deadpan humor to an in
tense philosophical stance, often
in the same paragraph.
He calls himself a pessimist,
yet his new movie is peopled by
dwarves and fairies. His aims up
until Wizards have been X-rated
and R-rated, yet he admits that
with two boys and two girls and
15 years of marriage. "1 am about
as straight a family man as you'll
find."
So which is the real Ralph
Bakshi? The one that spends the
hours between six a.m. and
seven p.m. at his animation
studio in Hollywood directing
films that take two years? Or the
one who insists. "1 can't lose all
touch with reality" and does oil
paintings reminiscent of Edwin
Hopper's in his spare time?
Not a schizo
Bakshi isn't schizophrenic, as
far as I could tell over the lunch
table, but I think perhaps each of
his attitudes balances another, as
if he feels compelled to con
stantly moderate the ingredients
of his life.
The X-rated films, beginning
with Fritz The Cat in 1972, were

perhaps a counter-reaction to his
years at Terrytoons as one of the
highest-paid animators in New
York City. "You know the kind
— cat chases mouse; cat catches
mouse; cat opens mouth to eat
mouse; mouse puts firecracker
in cat's mouth; firecracker
explodes; cat smiles; cat's teeth
fall out. It was driving me to
drink."
But, after five years in the
animated feature film business
— the only director so employed
despite his success and Hol
lywood's nasty habit of imitation
— his reaction runs in the direc
tion of pessimism again. "You
can't win in our business. You
do what you can when you can."
He does fantasy films because
"that's my escape. People who
are into fantasy want to escape
what's happening. What's hap
pening sucks."
'The Lord of the Rings'
And while Bakshi talks dis
paragingly of the past, he paints
the future like a frame from
Wizards, awash with vivid col
ors and striking scenery. He ap
proaches his future projects with
a brazen intensity, even though
failure at a certain trio of them
could mean certain lynching at
the hands of the literary world.

determined to create the perfect
visualization of The Lord OfThe
Rings. Perhaps that's where his
talent comes from — his ability
to see and understand both sides
to a question, to know that the
bottle can be both half-full and
half-empty at the same time.

Bakshi, a self-avowed pessimist, has nevertheless produced a
film populated by good fairies and dwarfs, albeit also evil goblins.
Ralph Bakshi, director of the
animated features Fritz the Cat,
Heavy Traffic and now Wizards,
comes across as a contradiction
both in terms and in conversa
tion. He progresses from a sly,
subtle, deadpan humor to an in
tense philosophical stance, often
in the same paragraph.
He calls himself a pessimist,
yet his new movie is peopled by
dwarves and fairies. His aims up
until Wizards have been X-rated
and R-rated, yet he admits that
with two boys and two girls and
15 years of marriage. "1 am about
as straight a family man as you'll
find."
So which is the real Ralph
Bakshi? The one that spends the
hours between six a.m. and
seven p.m. at his animation
studio in Hollywood directing
films that take two years? Or the
one who insists. "1 can't lose all
touch with reality" and does oil
paintings reminiscent of Edwin
Hopper's in his spare time?
Not a schizo
Bakshi isn't schizophrenic, as
far as I could tell over the lunch
table, but I think perhaps each of
his attitudes balances another, as
if he feels compelled to con
stantly moderate the ingredients
of his life.
The X-rated films, beginning
with Fritz The Cat in 1972, were

perhaps a counter-reaction to his
years at Terrytoons as one of the
highest-paid animators in New
York City. "You know the kind
— cat chases mouse; cat catches
mouse; cat opens mouth to eat
mouse; mouse puts firecracker
in cat's mouth; firecracker
explodes; cat smiles; cat's teeth
fall out. It was driving me to
drink."
But, after five years in the
animated feature film business
— the only director so employed
despite his success and Hol
lywood's nasty habit of imitation
— his reaction runs in the direc
tion of pessimism again. "You
can't win in our business. You
do what you can when you can."
He does fantasy films because
"that's my escape. People who
are into fantasy want to escape
what's happening. What's hap
pening sucks."
'The Lord of the Rings'
And while Bakshi talks dis
paragingly of the past, he paints
the future like a frame from
Wizards, awash with vivid col
ors and striking scenery. He ap
proaches his future projects with
a brazen intensity, even though
failure at a certain trio of them
could mean certain lynching at
the hands of the literary world.
Having purchased the rights
from theauthor's son and daugh

ter, Bakshi is animating the
J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy. The Lord
of the Rings.
Three pictures, one from each
book of the trilogy, have been
budgeted at fifteen million dol
lars apiece. Wizards, while
polished and classy, only cost
four million. Quadrupling that is
going to bankroll quite an ex
travaganza.
Asked about the characters'
appearances, he says"The Tol
kien calendar's wrong." He addf
in his characteristic balancing
way that "everyone seems to
have loved it—" and then re
flects that with. " —but I've
shown it to very few people."
However, Bakshi is unper
turbed.
"I'm going to do it perfect!" he
promises, noting the employ
ment of the voices of Laurence
Olivier and Ralph Richardson,
among other British actors. "I'll
do the pictures better than the
books. Movies are more power
ful than print — if it's done right,
it'll work."
Animated Kafka?
Beyond that, Bakshi has plans
to animate Franz Kafka's The
Penal Colony, drawn by Maurice
Sendak, who illustrated Where
The Wild Things Are. "It's not
going to make a penny," Bakshi
says confidently, "but we're
going to do it."
Amid his articulate
philosophizing on animation

("It's far superior to live action"),
writers' relationships with di
rectors, and his pessimism to
ward the past and his optimism
toward the future (or was it the
other way around?), we even de
dicated a few words to Wizards.
"This will be my biggest
film," he said proudly. "1
wanted to extend my audience. 1
wanted to do animation without
sex. I did six city films, and I
decided 1 wanted to do some
thing else. I love fantasy —you
can't grow up as an artist and nut
love fantasy. I wanted to 4°
something in that genre."
And while the basic crisis was
between the powers of technol
ogy and the powers of magic,
Bakshi insists there was no im
plicit message. "I tried to just let
the audience have a good time.
It's both a tribute and a parody.
The tribute comes from the love,
and the parody comes from my
having fun with them, But it was
not a bitter parody."
He loves the game. He haj#s
the game. His animation eimr~
nates fantasy. His animation
reeks of reality. He's out to get
what he can while he can. He's
determined to create the perfect
visualization of The Lord OfThe
Rings. Perhaps that's where his
talent comes from — his ability
to see and understand both sides
