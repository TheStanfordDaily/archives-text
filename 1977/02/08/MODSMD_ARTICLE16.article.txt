## Hollywood 'Thieves' rip off Broadway 
### 
Thieves, a newly released film
starring Mario Thomas and
Charles Grodin, proves once
more that a Broadway hit does
not guarantee a good movie. Al
though most of the cast and crew
from the theater version are also
in the screen adaptation, what
was once a Broadway biggie
looks doomed to be a film fiasco.
Would it be unkind to suggest
they should have stopped while
they were ahead?
The film, a light comedy, writ
ten by Herb Gardner, simply is
Hawed by its maudlin romanti
cism and unsuccessful attempts
at profundity.
The story is about t he Cramers,
a couple whose 12-year mar
riage, is in trouble. SallyCramer,
(Mario Thomas), a public school
teacher on New York's Lower
East side, is still trying to save
the world, while her husband,
Martin (Charles Grodin), has

long abandoned his adolescent
radicalism and settled comforta
bly into the principalship of a
fashionable private school.
While Martin wants to forget
his youth, Sally still clingc to an
oversenti mental memory of their
early marriage. Martin, refusing
to go along with Sally, does not
welcome her charity cases (di
linquent students) into his home
and Sally leaves Martin, filing
for divorce.
Sentimental plot
Underlying this sentimental,
romantic plot is the theme of
alienation. Sally's current dis
atisfaction with her marriage
comes to a head because she is
pregnant and unable to tell her
husband. Although she makes
several attempts to tell him, all
fail; either he doesn't hear, or he
misunderstands her.
Gardner links the characters'
inability to communicate with

their New York environment. He
creates an urban setting of crime
and degeneracy. The Cramers
symbolize the modern couple
whose marriage failure cari be
blamed on the society in which
thev live.
Although there are isolated
scenes in which the theme suc
ceeds, the overall effect is trite
and overworked. Had this theme
been treated sensitively, it might
have avoided all the cliches, but
director John Berry only contri
butes to the script's unoriginal
ity.
He has an impressive line-up
of cameo appearances (includ
ing Mercedes McCambridge,
John McMartin, Gary Merrill,
Ann Wedgeworth and Bob
Fosse), but these alone cannot
save his stereotypical interpreta
tion of the characters.
Berry attempts to create New
York by parading every New

York "type" he can conjure up.
In terms of mere numbers,
his representation is
mind-boggling- He includes a
Puerto Rican high school drop
out, a ragged street woman
(McCambridge), a black juvenile
delinquent, a taxi driver, a "one
night stand," the neighborhood
neurotic, winos, junkies. . .
Need 1 go on? The problem with
this approach is that there are too
many "types" and not enough
human beings, not enough
characters with substance.
The types are so old and obvi
ous the actors might as well be
wearing signs: "bums," "rich
lady," "floozy." It's conceivable
that these characterizations were
effective on the stage, but they
come across too vaudevillian on
the screen. The stereotypes are
too ridiculous to be believable,
too serious to be parodies. Take
Joe Kaminsky, Sally's father, for
example. Althoug finely acted
by Irwin Corey, a taxi driver who
cruises down Broadway
philosophizing about love is just
too much to tolerate even if he is
Irwin Corey.
Not all the characters are flat,
however. Both Ann
Wedgeworth (Nancy) and John
McMartin (Gordon), the other
woman and man in the Cramers'
lives, are delightful.
Wedgeworth's 40-ish southern
floozy is both wildly funny and
pathetically sad.
A witty lech
McMartin plays an appealing,
witty lech whose amorous
seduction of Sally is a welcome
change from Grodin's lethargic
portrayal of Martin. (Grodon had
a hectic scheduled during the
filming of Thieves. In addition to
doing the film, he was starring in
the Broadway play Same
Time, Next Year. His exhausting
schedule is apparent in Thieves.
In contast to Grodin's usually
fine acting, his characterization
of Martin is at best that of a som
nambulist.)

Interaction between Sally and
Martin is so dull compared to her
fling with Gordon that had I been
Sally, I would have dumped
Martin and moved in with Gor
don long ago. Some of the best
lines in the film come out of
Gordon's seduction scene. As he
and Sally climb the ladder lead
ing to Gordon's loft bed, Sally
remarks, "It's hard to make this
look like an accident."
This is only one of several
funny lines in Thieves which il
lustrates that author Herb Gard
ner (A Thousand Clowns) obvi
ously has a comic sense. Unfor
tunately, the humor is bogged
down by nauseating oversenti
mentality.
The trite script is improved
somewhat by Joseph Dipasquale
and Donald Biller's camera
work. Several aerial views of
New York's skyline enhance the
film and one street shot of the
Cramers' apartment complex
filmed straight up is incredible.
That one frame captures New
York more succintly than Berry's
entire entourage of "typical"
New Yorkers. Yet even the
photography is hokey in places,
due to the mushy love songs and
bango strumming used for
background music.
What of Mario Thomas? Well,
Mario is Mario. Her characteriza
tion of Sally Cramer, frank and
charmingly innocent, is good,
but why not? She's had five
years*as television's That Girl to
prepare for this role. The only
difference between Mario
Thomas, That Girl, and Mario
Thomas as Sally Cramer is a few
years. (I kept expecting her to
slip and say "Oh Donald" in
stead of "Oh Martin!")
So what's the best way to sum
up the film? One audience
member explained his ambiva
lent reaction by saying, "I guess I
just saw too many That Girl's to
appreciate more of the same."
(Thieves will open Friday, Feb
ruary 18 in Bay Area theaters.)

Who's that girl?
She's Mario Thomas, being hugged by Charles Grodin in
Paramount Pictures' Thieves, a Brut Production. Herb Gardner's
contemporary New York comedy, based on his Broadway play,
did not survive it's transition to Hollywood very well.
