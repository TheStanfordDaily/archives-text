Turner to be CIA head nominee
Washington — Adm. Stansfield Turner, a
Naval Academy classmate of President Jimmy
Carter, will be nominated to head the Central
Intelligence Agency, the White House an
nounced yesterday.
Turner, 53, is commander-in-chief of U.S.
forces in southern Europe.
Asked why Carter chose Turner, White House
Press Secretary Jody Powell said, "The major
reason is his (Carter's) feeling this is a person
who has his complete trust."
Theodore Sorensen, Carter's first choice for the
post, withdrew his nomination last month in the
face of Senate opposition.
Carter informed the Cabinet about his selection
yesterday morning, saying he never knew Turner
as a midshipman, White House spokesman Rex
Granum said.
"He was so far ahead of us that we never consi
dered him competition or even a peer and I'm not
exaggerating," Granum quoted Carter as telling
the Cabinet. "1 think you'll all be pleased with
Stan Turner. 1 have never known a better military
person."
Soviet craft to link with space lab
Moscow — The Soviet Union shot two cos
monauts into space yesterday for a linkup with
the orbiting Salyut 5 space laboratory, the Tass
news agency announced.
The news agency said the Soyuz 24 space mis
sion was proceeding normally and the cos
monauts were feeling fine. It described the flight
as routine and said it was designed "to continue
scientific-technical studies and experiments" on
Salyut 5 which were begun last July 7 with the
Soyuz 21 mission.
Monday's space shot is the first since the
aborted Soyuz 23 mission last October in which

two cosmonauts failed to link up with the space
lab and returned to earth two days after their
launch.
The Soyuz 23 failure was never fully
explained, but space observers have understood
the problem to have been in the docking system.
Aboard Soyuz 24 were Col. Viktor Gorbatko,
42, and flight engineer Lt. Col. Yuri Glazkov, 37,
Tass said. Both men reported back from space
that they felt fine and were enjoying themselves.
They would be the first men aboard Salyut 5
since the Soyuz 21 shot. Soyuz 22 was a photo
graphic mission that did not attempt a space lab
linkup.
Assemblyman denounces DNA bill
Sacramento — The chairman of the Assembly
Health Committee issued a tirade yesterday
against the state Health Department for releasing
details of a possible bill to control genetic re
search.
An aide to Jerome Lackner, state health direc
tor, drafted the bill which is being reviewed by
the administration of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
"It's much too early to look at comprehensive
drafts that demonstrate a pre-existing bias," said
Assemblyman Barry Keene (D-Eureka). "I was
astonished and amazed to learn that the proposal
was released at this time, and 1 am not in favor of
what it contains."
Keene said he would do all he could to prevent
the health department from having any authority
over "recombinant DNA" research, the mixing of
genes of different organisms to create new or
altered forms of life.
Critics say such mixture could result in
calamities of uncontrollable disease. Proponents
say such advances as insulin for diabetics re
sulted from such research.
However, no scientist can predict what could
result from DNA research, experts have testified.

Steelworkers to elect president
Pittsburgh — One of the most bitterly con
tested labor election campaigns in years ends
today when the 1.4 million-member United
Steelworkers (USWJ chooses a successor to retir
ing President I.W. Abel.
Heading the administration-backed slate is
Lloyd Mcßride, 60, a conservative union veteran
pledged to the USW's moderate policies.
He faces 38-year-old Edward Sadlowski, a
militant who says the union has grown soft and
too willing to accommodate corporation bosses.
The election's outcome will affect not only the
direction of the union but may also have major
implications for the nation's economy.
The USW is the largest unit of the AFL-CIO and
often sets the pattern for other unions. An abrupt
shift in USW policy could have far-reaching im
pact in other industries.
Swine flu epidemic highly unlikely
New York — The swine flu virus is not 1 ikely to
cause a great worldwide epidemic, say scientists
who have succeeded in identifying genetic
"fingerprints" of flu viruses.
They have isolated, for the first time, eight
genes in Type A flu virus. The genes can serve as
markers or fingerprints of such virus.
An analysis of "swine" virus isolated from sick
soldiers at Fort Dix. N.J., last year showed that al 1
eight of their virus' genes resembled those of
"true" swine viruses isolated from pigs, they said
yesterday. They seemed thus to be the same
virus.
One main virus theory holds that a pandemic,
or worldwide outbreak, of flu comes from a re
combination or marriage within the human body
of two different viruses One is a virus that nor
mally attacks humans; the other is one that nor
mally attacks some animal. The marriage pro
duces a virus against which there probably is no

natural body defense.
Their findings indicate that the New Jersey
swine virus was not any such recombination of
viruses.
Nuns shot in guerrilla attack
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Seven white Roman
Catholic missionaries, including four nuns, were
lined up and shot in a guerrilla attack that stun
ned Christian church groups in Rhodesia and
brought an expression of "profound grief" from
Pope Paul VI.
Officials said it was the worst group killing of
whites in four years of war by black guerrillas
against Rhodesia's white government.
The one survivor of the shooting said three
Cerman Dominican nuns, an English Dominican
nun, two Jesuit missionaries from Cermany and a
lay brother from Ireland were executed insidethe
compound of their mission school north of Salis
bury on Sunday night by guerrillas who argued
about who would do the shooting.
"They did not say one word about why they
were doing this to us," said Father Dunstant
Myerscough, an English Jesuit who said he threw
himself to the ground when the guerrillas opened
fire. "When one of the sisters asked what they
wanted, one of them said, 'We want our coun
try.' "
A telegram sent by the Vatican to black Ar
chbishop Patrick Chakaipa of Salisbury said
Pope Paul "prays for peace and justice to be re
established in allregions afflicted by these at
rocious crimes."
Today's weather
Showers likely today. Clearing tonight. Fair

Nuns shot in guerrilla attack
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Seven white Roman
Catholic missionaries, including four nuns, were
lined up and shot in a guerrilla attack that stun
ned Christian church groups in Rhodesia and
brought an expression of "profound grief" from
Pope Paul VI.
Officials said it was the worst group killing of
whites in four years of war by black guerrillas
against Rhodesia's white government.
The one survivor of the shooting said three
Cerman Dominican nuns, an English Dominican
nun, two Jesuit missionaries from Cermany and a
lay brother from Ireland were executed insidethe
compound of their mission school north of Salis
bury on Sunday night by guerrillas who argued
about who would do the shooting.
"They did not say one word about why they
were doing this to us," said Father Dunstant
Myerscough, an English Jesuit who said he threw
himself to the ground when the guerrillas opened
fire. "When one of the sisters asked what they
wanted, one of them said, 'We want our coun
try.' "
A telegram sent by the Vatican to black Ar
chbishop Patrick Chakaipa of Salisbury said
Pope Paul "prays for peace and justice to be re
established in allregions afflicted by these at
rocious crimes."

Turner to be CIA head nominee
Washington — Adm. Stansfield Turner, a
Naval Academy classmate of President Jimmy
Carter, will be nominated to head the Central
Intelligence Agency, the White House an
nounced yesterday.
Turner, 53, is commander-in-chief of U.S.
forces in southern Europe.
Asked why Carter chose Turner, White House
Press Secretary Jody Powell said, "The major
reason is his (Carter's) feeling this is a person
who has his complete trust."
Theodore Sorensen, Carter's first choice for the
post, withdrew his nomination last month in the
face of Senate opposition.
Carter informed the Cabinet about his selection
yesterday morning, saying he never knew Turner
as a midshipman, White House spokesman Rex
Granum said.
"He was so far ahead of us that we never consi
dered him competition or even a peer and I'm not
exaggerating," Granum quoted Carter as telling
the Cabinet. "1 think you'll all be pleased with
Stan Turner. 1 have never known a better military
person."
Soviet craft to link with space lab
Moscow — The Soviet Union shot two cos
monauts into space yesterday for a linkup with
the orbiting Salyut 5 space laboratory, the Tass
news agency announced.
The news agency said the Soyuz 24 space mis
sion was proceeding normally and the cos
monauts were feeling fine. It described the flight
as routine and said it was designed "to continue
scientific-technical studies and experiments" on
Salyut 5 which were begun last July 7 with the
Soyuz 21 mission.
Monday's space shot is the first since the
aborted Soyuz 23 mission last October in which

two cosmonauts failed to link up with the space
lab and returned to earth two days after their
launch.
The Soyuz 23 failure was never fully
explained, but space observers have understood
the problem to have been in the docking system.
Aboard Soyuz 24 were Col. Viktor Gorbatko,
42, and flight engineer Lt. Col. Yuri Glazkov, 37,
Tass said. Both men reported back from space
that they felt fine and were enjoying themselves.
They would be the first men aboard Salyut 5
since the Soyuz 21 shot. Soyuz 22 was a photo
graphic mission that did not attempt a space lab
linkup.
Assemblyman denounces DNA bill
Sacramento — The chairman of the Assembly
Health Committee issued a tirade yesterday
against the state Health Department for releasing
details of a possible bill to control genetic re
search.
An aide to Jerome Lackner, state health direc
tor, drafted the bill which is being reviewed by
the administration of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
"It's much too early to look at comprehensive
drafts that demonstrate a pre-existing bias," said
Assemblyman Barry Keene (D-Eureka). "I was
astonished and amazed to learn that the proposal
was released at this time, and 1 am not in favor of
what it contains."
Keene said he would do all he could to prevent
the health department from having any authority
over "recombinant DNA" research, the mixing of
genes of different organisms to create new or
altered forms of life.
Critics say such mixture could result in
calamities of uncontrollable disease. Proponents
say such advances as insulin for diabetics re
sulted from such research.
However, no scientist can predict what could
result from DNA research, experts have testified.

Steelworkers to elect president
Pittsburgh — One of the most bitterly con
tested labor election campaigns in years ends
today when the 1.4 million-member United
Steelworkers (USWJ chooses a successor to retir
ing President I.W. Abel.
Heading the administration-backed slate is
Lloyd Mcßride, 60, a conservative union veteran
pledged to the USW's moderate policies.
He faces 38-year-old Edward Sadlowski, a
militant who says the union has grown soft and
too willing to accommodate corporation bosses.
The election's outcome will affect not only the
direction of the union but may also have major
implications for the nation's economy.
The USW is the largest unit of the AFL-CIO and
often sets the pattern for other unions. An abrupt
shift in USW policy could have far-reaching im
pact in other industries.
Swine flu epidemic highly unlikely
New York — The swine flu virus is not 1 ikely to
cause a great worldwide epidemic, say scientists
who have succeeded in identifying genetic
"fingerprints" of flu viruses.
They have isolated, for the first time, eight
genes in Type A flu virus. The genes can serve as
markers or fingerprints of such virus.
An analysis of "swine" virus isolated from sick
soldiers at Fort Dix. N.J., last year showed that al 1
eight of their virus' genes resembled those of
"true" swine viruses isolated from pigs, they said
yesterday. They seemed thus to be the same
virus.
One main virus theory holds that a pandemic,
or worldwide outbreak, of flu comes from a re
combination or marriage within the human body
of two different viruses One is a virus that nor
mally attacks humans; the other is one that nor
mally attacks some animal. The marriage pro
duces a virus against which there probably is no

natural body defense.
Their findings indicate that the New Jersey
swine virus was not any such recombination of

Swine flu epidemic highly unlikely
New York — The swine flu virus is not 1 ikely to
cause a great worldwide epidemic, say scientists
who have succeeded in identifying genetic
"fingerprints" of flu viruses.
They have isolated, for the first time, eight
genes in Type A flu virus. The genes can serve as
markers or fingerprints of such virus.
An analysis of "swine" virus isolated from sick
soldiers at Fort Dix. N.J., last year showed that al 1
eight of their virus' genes resembled those of
"true" swine viruses isolated from pigs, they said
yesterday. They seemed thus to be the same
virus.
One main virus theory holds that a pandemic,
or worldwide outbreak, of flu comes from a re
combination or marriage within the human body
of two different viruses One is a virus that nor
mally attacks humans; the other is one that nor
mally attacks some animal. The marriage pro
duces a virus against which there probably is no

natural body defense.
Their findings indicate that the New Jersey
swine virus was not any such recombination of
viruses.
Nuns shot in guerrilla attack
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Seven white Roman
Catholic missionaries, including four nuns, were
lined up and shot in a guerrilla attack that stun
ned Christian church groups in Rhodesia and
brought an expression of "profound grief" from
Pope Paul VI.
Officials said it was the worst group killing of
whites in four years of war by black guerrillas
against Rhodesia's white government.
The one survivor of the shooting said three
Cerman Dominican nuns, an English Dominican
nun, two Jesuit missionaries from Cermany and a
lay brother from Ireland were executed insidethe
compound of their mission school north of Salis
bury on Sunday night by guerrillas who argued
about who would do the shooting.
"They did not say one word about why they
were doing this to us," said Father Dunstant
Myerscough, an English Jesuit who said he threw
himself to the ground when the guerrillas opened
fire. "When one of the sisters asked what they
wanted, one of them said, 'We want our coun
try.' "
A telegram sent by the Vatican to black Ar
chbishop Patrick Chakaipa of Salisbury said
Pope Paul "prays for peace and justice to be re
established in allregions afflicted by these at
rocious crimes."

Turner to be CIA head nominee
Washington — Adm. Stansfield Turner, a
Naval Academy classmate of President Jimmy
Carter, will be nominated to head the Central
Intelligence Agency, the White House an
nounced yesterday.
Turner, 53, is commander-in-chief of U.S.
forces in southern Europe.
Asked why Carter chose Turner, White House
Press Secretary Jody Powell said, "The major
reason is his (Carter's) feeling this is a person
who has his complete trust."
Theodore Sorensen, Carter's first choice for the
post, withdrew his nomination last month in the
face of Senate opposition.
Carter informed the Cabinet about his selection
yesterday morning, saying he never knew Turner
as a midshipman, White House spokesman Rex
Granum said.
"He was so far ahead of us that we never consi
dered him competition or even a peer and I'm not
exaggerating," Granum quoted Carter as telling
the Cabinet. "1 think you'll all be pleased with
Stan Turner. 1 have never known a better military
person."
Soviet craft to link with space lab
Moscow — The Soviet Union shot two cos
monauts into space yesterday for a linkup with
the orbiting Salyut 5 space laboratory, the Tass
news agency announced.
The news agency said the Soyuz 24 space mis
sion was proceeding normally and the cos
monauts were feeling fine. It described the flight
as routine and said it was designed "to continue
scientific-technical studies and experiments" on
Salyut 5 which were begun last July 7 with the
Soyuz 21 mission.
Monday's space shot is the first since the
aborted Soyuz 23 mission last October in which

two cosmonauts failed to link up with the space
lab and returned to earth two days after their
launch.
The Soyuz 23 failure was never fully
explained, but space observers have understood
the problem to have been in the docking system.
Aboard Soyuz 24 were Col. Viktor Gorbatko,
42, and flight engineer Lt. Col. Yuri Glazkov, 37,
Tass said. Both men reported back from space
that they felt fine and were enjoying themselves.
They would be the first men aboard Salyut 5
since the Soyuz 21 shot. Soyuz 22 was a photo
graphic mission that did not attempt a space lab
linkup.
Assemblyman denounces DNA bill
Sacramento — The chairman of the Assembly
Health Committee issued a tirade yesterday
against the state Health Department for releasing
details of a possible bill to control genetic re
search.
An aide to Jerome Lackner, state health direc
tor, drafted the bill which is being reviewed by
the administration of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
"It's much too early to look at comprehensive
drafts that demonstrate a pre-existing bias," said
Assemblyman Barry Keene (D-Eureka). "I was
astonished and amazed to learn that the proposal
was released at this time, and 1 am not in favor of
what it contains."
Keene said he would do all he could to prevent
the health department from having any authority
over "recombinant DNA" research, the mixing of
genes of different organisms to create new or
altered forms of life.
Critics say such mixture could result in
calamities of uncontrollable disease. Proponents
say such advances as insulin for diabetics re
sulted from such research.
However, no scientist can predict what could
result from DNA research, experts have testified.
