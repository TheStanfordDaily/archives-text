# Frozen East returns to work
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Bundled up
against the cold, workers returned to
chilly factories yesterday as natural
gas started flowing to some eastern
and midwestern industries closed
when frigid weather strained energy
supplies to the breaking point.
Authorities in many areas warned
that plants could he shut down again if
the weather takes a turn for the worse.
Below-freezing temperatures gripped
much of the eastern half of the country
yesterday, but there were predictions
of improvement later in the week.

Between 1.2 million and 1.57 mill
ion persons — most of them in Ohio
and New York — have been laid off
their jobs because of the natural gas
shortage, new federal and state reports
indicate.
A report given White House energy
advisor James Schlesinger over the
weekend shows gas-shortage un
employment in at least 17 states, rang
ing from about 1000 each in Missis
sippi and Wisconsin to an estimated
250,000 in New York and 550,000 to
one million in Ohio. The report is

based on estimates prepared by the
Commerce Department and by state
agencies.
The memo said weather forecasters
anticipated some easing of the cold
wave this week but warned that freez
ing Arctic air would probably return
"for at least the following two to three
weeks."
It said some states were having prob
lems in distributing alternate fuels
such as propane and light and heavy
fuel oils but there was no current indi
cation of shortages to consumers.
Although yesterday brought back
to-work orders for hundreds of
thousands of laid-off employes, many
factories faced longer shutdowns be
cause of still-short natural gas
supplies.
In Buffalo. N.Y., the city continued
to dig out from a Jan. 28 blizzard.
Mayor Stanley Makowski eased re
strictions on city driving, opening
streets to private vehicles with some
limitations — a 20 mile-an-hour speed
limit, no parking on bus routes and at
least two other persons besides the
driver in all vehicles.
The National Weather Service pre
dicted the temperature in Buffalo
might rise above freezing Thursday for
the first time in lVa months.
Businesses that were open operated
at lower-than-usual temperatures. In
Virginia, for example, schools and
businesses were required to keep
thermostats at 55 or less.
And in North Carolina, most of the
state's 10,000 employes took the day
off in compliance with Gov. Jim! hint's
four-day work week order to conserve
energy.
Carter has declared disaster areas in
four states — New York, Maryland,
Virginia and Florida. Five other states
have asked for some type of disaster
declaration — Michigan, Indiana,
Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsyl
vania


Maybe yes, maybe . . . snow?
No, this is not a bench from the Frozen East,' it's a
bench from sunny Palo Alto the way it was Feb. 5,
