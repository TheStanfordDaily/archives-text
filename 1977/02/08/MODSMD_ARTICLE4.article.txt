## 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
Theme houses for the study of sex
roles (androgyny) and the German
language should be established on
campus, the Configuration Advisory
Panel on Housing recommended last
night.
The panel will pass its recommenda
tion to Acting Associate Dean of Stu
dents Norm Robinson, who will make
the decision, subject to review by Dean
of Students James Lyons.
The decision to recommend the
German Studies house was unanim
ous, while the vote on Androgyny
House was six to two with two abstain
ing, according to Row Director Karen
Murray.
Asked if the panel's recommenda
tion will carry weight with Robinson,
Murray replied. "Oh. yes," and
pointed out that Robinson was present
at the meeting and took part in discus
sions.
Locations for the theme houses were
not discussed. Murray said, "Norm
decides the location, but he may con
sult with COSS/R" (the Subcommittee
on Residences of the Committee on
Services to Students).
Expressed interest
Sophomore Carla Lupi, who has cal
led for Androgyny House, said bet
ween 80 and 90 people expressed in
terest in living in such a house.
Androgyny House supporters circu
lated petitions around Maples Pavil
ion on registration day this quarter.
The petitions included a space for the
signer to check if he or she were in
terested in living in the house, and
about 90 did so, Lupi said.
The Androgyny proposal included
weekly consciousness-raising ses
sions for house residents, according to
Lupi.
"Consciousness-raising groups here
would have topics concerning sexism,
how members of the group are affected
by it, how they would like to deal with
it," Lupi said.
No plans
However, she added, there are cur
rently no plans to establish require
ments for admission to the house. Most
theme houses require either <i certain
level of study in their subject matter or
prior interaction with current house
residents.
"We debated the idea of a special
selection process, but decided that
there would be too many hassles,"
Lupi said. "So we're just going to take
them from the draw."
She also said that Androgyny House
supporters had not suggested any loca
tions for the house to the panel.
German Prof. Orrin Robinson, a
member of the residence subcommit
tee, said 05 people signed a petition in
support of a German theme house. He
also said about 25 showed up at a meet
ing for those interested in working for
the house.
The professor said the level of Ger

man needed for admission to the house
has not yet heen determined.
"We want this to be an outward
looking house." he said. "An impor
tant aspect is that people should really
speak German here."
He said that those working for a
German theme house had benefited
from the example of the French theme
house. "A big problem was that they
admitted too many people who just
couldn't speak French," Robinson
said.
One proposal said a German theme
house could offer free dinners to
graduate students in German, in return
for their staying after dinner to tutor or
lead a discussion in German, he re
ported.
Another idea was a reading room
with current issues of German
magazines and newspapers, he said.
"A big priority would be helping
prepare students to go to the overseas
campuses and providing an environ
ment for people coming back where
they could keep up with European cul
ture," he said.

ing, according to Row Director Karen
Murray.
Asked if the panel's recommenda
tion will carry weight with Robinson,
Murray replied. "Oh. yes," and
pointed out that Robinson was present
at the meeting and took part in discus
sions.
Locations for the theme houses were
not discussed. Murray said, "Norm
decides the location, but he may con
sult with COSS/R" (the Subcommittee
on Residences of the Committee on
Services to Students).
Expressed interest
Sophomore Carla Lupi, who has cal
led for Androgyny House, said bet
ween 80 and 90 people expressed in
terest in living in such a house.
Androgyny House supporters circu
lated petitions around Maples Pavil
ion on registration day this quarter.
The petitions included a space for the
signer to check if he or she were in
terested in living in the house, and
about 90 did so, Lupi said.
The Androgyny proposal included
weekly consciousness-raising ses
sions for house residents, according to
Lupi.
"Consciousness-raising groups here
would have topics concerning sexism,
how members of the group are affected
by it, how they would like to deal with
it," Lupi said.
No plans
However, she added, there are cur
rently no plans to establish require
ments for admission to the house. Most
theme houses require either <i certain
level of study in their subject matter or
prior interaction with current house
residents.
"We debated the idea of a special
selection process, but decided that
there would be too many hassles,"
Lupi said. "So we're just going to take
them from the draw."
She also said that Androgyny House
supporters had not suggested any loca
tions for the house to the panel.
German Prof. Orrin Robinson, a
member of the residence subcommit
tee, said 05 people signed a petition in
support of a German theme house. He
also said about 25 showed up at a meet
ing for those interested in working for
the house.
The professor said the level of Ger

man needed for admission to the house
has not yet heen determined.
"We want this to be an outward
looking house." he said. "An impor
tant aspect is that people should really
speak German here."
He said that those working for a
German theme house had benefited
from the example of the French theme
house. "A big problem was that they
admitted too many people who just
couldn't speak French," Robinson
said.
One proposal said a German theme
house could offer free dinners to
graduate students in German, in return
for their staying after dinner to tutor or
lead a discussion in German, he re
ported.
Another idea was a reading room
with current issues of German
magazines and newspapers, he said.
"A big priority would be helping
prepare students to go to the overseas
campuses and providing an environ
ment for people coming back where
they could keep up with European cul
ture," he said.
Theme houses for the study of sex
roles (androgyny) and the German
language should be established on
campus, the Configuration Advisory
Panel on Housing recommended last
night.
The panel will pass its recommenda
tion to Acting Associate Dean of Stu
dents Norm Robinson, who will make
the decision, subject to review by Dean
of Students James Lyons.
The decision to recommend the
German Studies house was unanim
ous, while the vote on Androgyny
House was six to two with two abstain
ing, according to Row Director Karen
Murray.
