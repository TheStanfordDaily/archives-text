# Board approves loans to parents
## 
### Mike Charison 
The Hoard of Trustees approved a
plan to loan parents of students here
up to $6000 annually to help cover
costs of tuition, room and board yes
terday at its meeting in Los Angeles.
In other major action, the board ap
proved $320,000 for remodeling of the
Monterey Boatworks at the Hopkins
Marine Station, and accepted five new
endowed professorships.
Under the so-called parent loan
program, parents with an annual gross
income of between $20,000 and
$60,000 per year would be eligible to
apply for a loan from the University.
Up to $1 million can be loaned from
an investment pool ordinarily used for
the purchase of short term corporate
bonds and notes, according to Rodney
Adams, director of finance. Adams
will serve as administrator of the new
program.
The program will begin with parents
of students in the Class of 1981. If de
mand is sufficient, the program maybe
expanded to accommodate earlier
classes, according to Robert Huff, di
rector of financial aids.
'Major departure'
"The program represents a major
departure from University policy on
financial aids," Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Robert Rosenzweig said. He
said all matters of financial aids have
traditionally been between the Uni
versity and the student.
Huff said the program puts the loan
"in the family context" for the first
time and relieves a great deal of in
debtedness and burden from the stu
dent.
Vice President for Business and Fi

nance Raymond Bacchetti said details
on criteria used for loan application
analysis have not yet been formulated.
The loan program will pay for itself,
Adams said, and will hopefully result
in an eight percent return. The interest
rate approved by the trustees was not
available, but Adams said the ad
ministration proposal would ask for an
8.75 per cent rate with 0.75 per cent
going for administrative costs and a
bad debt reserve fund.
An investment
Adams said the University looks at
the loan program as an investment.
The program will be administered
from the Business and Finance Office
as opposed to the Financial Aids Of
fice.
"In terms of banking and lending,
we believe it's an acceptable risk,"
Adams said. "It is in some ways not as
safe as the bonds and notes of a major
corporation, but it is the parents of the
students who attend here (who will
receive the loan). We feel they are a
good risk."
If a parent did borrow, a repayment
schedule would begin the following
month and spread payments out over
six to eight years.
As far as actual payment guarantees,
there are "none whatever," according
to Bacchetti. He said no collateral will
be required, but that the University
would take normal means to collect on
loans if problems arise.
Parents will be able to buy insurance
on loans, he said, and a "rigorous cre
dit check" will take place before any
loans are issued.
'Take action'
"If the parent doesn't pay, we will
take action to prevent further money
from being advanced." Adams said.
He added that the registrar and finan
cial aids office would be notified that
the student's method of payment for
fees had stopped.
To register for the following quarter
after a loan default by his parents, a
student would have to pay fees in
another way.
Bacchetti conceded that misuse of
the loan program could occur, espe
cially with parents who have high in
comes. "We will rely on the honesty of
the parents" to prevent affluent pa
rents from using loans to get cheap
money for personal investments, he
said.
Huff defended the $00,000 upper
limit on the loans because he said
many families with an income that
high have "cash flow" problems,
especially if more than one child is in
school.
Below $20,000, Huff said students
would be eligible for traditional finan
cial aid, including federally insured
loans with a lower interest rate and
longer repayment period.
The program was adapted from a
similar one initiated at Harvard last
fall. There. Huff said, the program is
"fulfilling a real need," and will con
tinue next year after its one year trial
period. He said Harvard uses the same
income limits to be used here. The two
institutions are now the only two in
the country with such a program.
In othjr action, the board approved
expenditure of $320,000 for remodel
ing of the dilapidated Monterey Boat
works at Hopkins Marine Station, first
constructed in 1920. The work will be
completed by June 1 Pi, 1977 to allow
for activation July 1 in time for the
summer program at Hopkins.

Huff defended the $00,000 upper
limit on the loans because he said
many families with an income that
high have "cash flow" problems,
especially if more than one child is in
school.
Below $20,000, Huff said students
would be eligible for traditional finan
cial aid, including federally insured
loans with a lower interest rate and
longer repayment period.
The program was adapted from a
similar one initiated at Harvard last
fall. There. Huff said, the program is
"fulfilling a real need," and will con
tinue next year after its one year trial
period. He said Harvard uses the same
income limits to be used here. The two
institutions are now the only two in
the country with such a program.
In othjr action, the board approved
expenditure of $320,000 for remodel
ing of the dilapidated Monterey Boat
works at Hopkins Marine Station, first
constructed in 1920. The work will be
completed by June 1 Pi, 1977 to allow
for activation July 1 in time for the
summer program at Hopkins.
The Hoard of Trustees approved a
plan to loan parents of students here
up to $6000 annually to help cover
costs of tuition, room and board yes
terday at its meeting in Los Angeles.
In other major action, the board ap
proved $320,000 for remodeling of the
Monterey Boatworks at the Hopkins
Marine Station, and accepted five new
endowed professorships.
Under the so-called parent loan
program, parents with an annual gross
income of between $20,000 and
$60,000 per year would be eligible to
apply for a loan from the University.
Up to $1 million can be loaned from
an investment pool ordinarily used for
the purchase of short term corporate
bonds and notes, according to Rodney
Adams, director of finance. Adams
will serve as administrator of the new
program.
The program will begin with parents
of students in the Class of 1981. If de
mand is sufficient, the program maybe
expanded to accommodate earlier
classes, according to Robert Huff, di
rector of financial aids.
'Major departure'
"The program represents a major
departure from University policy on
financial aids," Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Robert Rosenzweig said. He
said all matters of financial aids have
traditionally been between the Uni
versity and the student.
Huff said the program puts the loan
"in the family context" for the first
time and relieves a great deal of in
debtedness and burden from the stu
dent.
Vice President for Business and Fi

nance Raymond Bacchetti said details
on criteria used for loan application
analysis have not yet been formulated.
The loan program will pay for itself,
Adams said, and will hopefully result
in an eight percent return. The interest
rate approved by the trustees was not
available, but Adams said the ad
ministration proposal would ask for an
8.75 per cent rate with 0.75 per cent
going for administrative costs and a
bad debt reserve fund.
An investment
Adams said the University looks at
the loan program as an investment.
The program will be administered
from the Business and Finance Office
as opposed to the Financial Aids Of
fice.
"In terms of banking and lending,
we believe it's an acceptable risk,"
Adams said. "It is in some ways not as
safe as the bonds and notes of a major
corporation, but it is the parents of the
students who attend here (who will
receive the loan). We feel they are a
good risk."
If a parent did borrow, a repayment
schedule would begin the following
month and spread payments out over
six to eight years.
As far as actual payment guarantees,
there are "none whatever," according
to Bacchetti. He said no collateral will
be required, but that the University
would take normal means to collect on
loans if problems arise.
Parents will be able to buy insurance
on loans, he said, and a "rigorous cre
dit check" will take place before any
loans are issued.
'Take action'
"If the parent doesn't pay, we will
take action to prevent further money
from being advanced." Adams said.
He added that the registrar and finan
cial aids office would be notified that
the student's method of payment for
fees had stopped.
To register for the following quarter
after a loan default by his parents, a
student would have to pay fees in
another way.
Bacchetti conceded that misuse of
the loan program could occur, espe
cially with parents who have high in
comes. "We will rely on the honesty of
the parents" to prevent affluent pa
rents from using loans to get cheap
money for personal investments, he
said.

six to eight years.
As far as actual payment guarantees,
there are "none whatever," according
to Bacchetti. He said no collateral will
be required, but that the University
would take normal means to collect on
loans if problems arise.
Parents will be able to buy insurance
on loans, he said, and a "rigorous cre
dit check" will take place before any
loans are issued.
'Take action'
"If the parent doesn't pay, we will
take action to prevent further money
from being advanced." Adams said.
He added that the registrar and finan
cial aids office would be notified that
the student's method of payment for
fees had stopped.
To register for the following quarter
after a loan default by his parents, a
student would have to pay fees in
another way.
Bacchetti conceded that misuse of
the loan program could occur, espe
cially with parents who have high in
comes. "We will rely on the honesty of
the parents" to prevent affluent pa
rents from using loans to get cheap
money for personal investments, he
said.
Huff defended the $00,000 upper
limit on the loans because he said
many families with an income that
high have "cash flow" problems,
especially if more than one child is in
school.
Below $20,000, Huff said students
would be eligible for traditional finan
cial aid, including federally insured
loans with a lower interest rate and
longer repayment period.
The program was adapted from a
similar one initiated at Harvard last
fall. There. Huff said, the program is
"fulfilling a real need," and will con
tinue next year after its one year trial
period. He said Harvard uses the same
income limits to be used here. The two
institutions are now the only two in
the country with such a program.
In othjr action, the board approved
expenditure of $320,000 for remodel
ing of the dilapidated Monterey Boat
works at Hopkins Marine Station, first
constructed in 1920. The work will be
completed by June 1 Pi, 1977 to allow
for activation July 1 in time for the
summer program at Hopkins.
