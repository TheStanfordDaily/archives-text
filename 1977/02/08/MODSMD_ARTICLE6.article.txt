# Minority employment practices prompt suit
## 
### Stephanie Smith 
A former University employe is pre
paring to file a class action suit against
the University to "focus attention on
minority hiring processes at Stan
ford."
Maria Schneider, formerly a senior
employe representative in the Person
nel Department, said she is in the
"process of talking to an attorney"
about filing a suit. She said the reason
for the suit is "about four years of
watching the employment system at
Stanford." Schneider said she res
igned from her position last week to
protest the unresponsiveness of the
University to the needs of minorities.
"It's kind of hard to pinpoint one
specific action which prompted my
suit," she saiil. "I'm basically a con
servative who has never bucked the
system before, especially something
like Stanford University, hut I saw the
need for someone to do this."
In her letter of resignation to the
University and the Personnel Office,
she mentioned four specific areas in
which she felt the University could
improve:
—supervisory training
—hiring activities
—ongoing development of employe
skills
—basic personnel administration
Schneider said she hopes her suit
will motivate employe supervisors to
focus attention on their liirinu orac

tices and to work with employes once
they have been hired.
"For years many hiring managers
and supervisors have been motivated
to look at their hiring practices be
cause of fear (of legal action). The fact
that I'm filing a suit shows them that
anyone of their employes can bring a
suit against them. This brings back the
motivation by fear to scrutinize their
hiring practices," Schneider said.
Another factor which prompted
Schneider's resignation was the Per
sonnel Office's failure to hire
chicanos, she said.
"1 couldn't call a dean or assistant
dean in another area to make recom
mendations about their hiring prac
tices when in fact my organization was
not doing those things which I was
recommending. It would really pu < me
in a hypocritical spot," she said.
"There are many chicano workers
on campus, some of them use the grie
vance processes set up by the Univer
sity but there are others who are afraid
to because of fear of repercussions in
their department." Schneider said.
James Siena, legal adviser to Presi
dent Richard Lyman, said that he
didn't know anything about
Schneider's suit "except that it has
been reported that she has the inten
tion to do it (file a suit). I really can't
speculate about our responses to her
suit until we receive official notice
about it."
