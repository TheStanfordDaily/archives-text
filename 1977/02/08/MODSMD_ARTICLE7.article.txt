# Electoral College: its applicability today
## Threat to Democracy 
### 
Jack Bogdanski

Every four years, America plays
Russian roulette with its most
cherished institution. The Electoral
College, the body which elects our
president, is more than an innocuous
anachronism, it is a timebomb for our
republic.
As every elementary school civic
class knows, the American people do
not elect the president. Instead, they
choose electors to do it for them. Each
state is a winner-take-all contest, with
its entire delegation of votes thrown
to electors pledged for one candidate.
The electors, equal in number to the
state's congressional delegation, meet
shortly after the popular election to
cast their votes.
Early in January, their ballots are
opened, and if the system functions
properly, one candidate receives a
majority and is thus elected president.
Annual proposals to eliminate or
alter the system invariably die a quiet
death. But upon considering the col
lege's dangers and the obsolescence
of its view of government, it becomes
obvious that it should immediately be
discarded.
Mob rule
The potential for uninformed mob
rule so frightened Alexander Hamil
ton and his colleagues that they be
lieved a check was needed on the
people's power to select a leader.
There was a distrust for political
parties, too. George Washington
urged his countrymen not to join
them.
The resulting plan for presidential
elections was to have it done by inde
pendent, cosmopolitan men with the
final say on who should be chosen.
Congressmen and public officehol
ders would be excluded from their
number, so that their political purity
would be assured. No one would
know for certain who the next presi
dent would be until the electors met
and voted; their decisionmaking
would often be suspenseful.
Today, of course, this view is ab
surd. Political parties are here to stay;
mass communication makes Ameri
cans better informed than ever before.
The electors, moreover, promise to
vote for particular candidates, and the

people have come to rely on those
supposed commitments. There is no
careful screening of the electors; few
even know who the electors are.
Traps
Examining the Electoral College
carefully, one finds that it is grossly
unfair and illogical, with treacherous
traps for our system of government,
for example:
Minority rule—One particular fea
ture of the present system that galls
many observers is its potential to have
a president elected by a minority of
the American people. Although its
winner-take-all character encourages
campaigning in many different states,

the fact remains that the will of the
majority may be ignored. Andrew
Jackson once lost with a majority of
the popular vote, as did Grover Cleve
land. Public confidence in our leaders
and democracy is undermined when
this occurs.
The independent elector—
Although morally pledged to vote for
the candidate for whom they voice
preference, electors can change their
minds and vote for whomever they
please. In 1968, a Carolina Republican
elector switched his vote from Nixon
to Wallace. Given the original notion
that electors are to be independent,
this move was probably perfectly
legal. Some states require electors to
sign oaths of allegiance and others
have passed ordinances restricting
their independence — but these mea
sures are probably unconstitutional.
The plurality problem—to be
elected, a candidate must have a

majority of the electoral votes — 50
per cent plus one. If there are more
than two candidates, however, it is
quite possible that each will receive
less than half, say 45, 45 and 10 per
cent. If this occurs, the candidate with
10 per cent of the electoral votes —
picture George Wallace or Eugene
McCarthy —can throw the election by
convincing his electors to vote for one
of the more popular candidates. The
possibilities for abuse through politi
cal deals and patronage is limitless in
this situation.
When the college fails— If no such
deals are struck in the college, and no
majority emerges by the time it votes,
Congress selects the president. Not
only is this likely to be a stormy pro
cess, but a hurried and anti
majoritarian one as well.
First of all, there are fewer than 20
days in which Congress may do it.
The votes of the electors are opened at
the start of the congressional session,
around Jan. 1; a president is due to be
inaugurated on Jan. 20. With the
people already disturbed by the
chance that they will be leaderless,
and clamoring for a resolution of the
problem, there is an immense time
crunch.
But even more alarming is the
method by which Congress elects.
The House of Representatives elects
the president, but each state delega
tion votes as a unit with one vote; if a
state has an even number of represen
tatives and they tie, it gets no vote.
The Senate, meanwhile, is hurrying to
elect the vice president, who may or
may not be of the same party as the
candidate selected as president.
Whatever the proposals for reform
— direct election, apportioning elec
toral votes or at least legal commit
ments to candidates by electors—they
should be carefully considered.
Indeed, without change, we may
find ourselves in a life-and-death
struggle for survival as a democratic
nation — all for the sake of some
vague and outdated notions of his
tory.
