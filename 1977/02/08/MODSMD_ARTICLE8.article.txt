# Harm yet to be proved

The excitement generated by the
1976 presidential election has dispel
led. Carter is president and once
again, Congress attempts to reform
the electoral process, specifically the
Electoral College, before the next elec
tion period.
For years Congress has investigated
the abolition and reform of the Elec
toral College and this time they just
might succeed in getting rid of it. Un
less you want to be swept away by the
emotional rhetoric of those who seek
change for the sake of change, it is
important to examine our present sys
tem to determine whether there is suf
ficient justification to warrant change
of the Electoral College. On the basis
of the research 1 have done, I find no
significant reason for change.
The standard argument is that the
Electoral College should be abolished
because it no longer serves the function
for which it was originally intended
(It was established largely as a precau
tion against the uninformed general
public electing a (demagogue.)
Although, it is correct, the Electoral
College does not serve this original
purpose, so what? The college's
opponents have not proved any harm
incurred by the institution.
The Electoral College, despite its
flaws, has only once in its history
elected a president who received
fewer popular votes than his oppo
nent. This occurred in 1888 when
Cleveland's voting edge was only
100,000 votes â€” certainly not an
overwhelming mandate. Also, there
was so much voting fraud by both par
ties at the state level that there is no
conclusive proof that the discrepancy
between popular and Electoral Col
lege votes was a result of the Electoral
College.
Theoretical
U.S. Sen. Sam Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.) said
in 1974, "Despite its minor defects,
the electoral college system has un
questionably provided this nation
with the most successful method for
electing national leadership known in
modern history." He further added
that the possibility of a future presi
dential candidate receiving less
popular votes than his opponent is

"largely a theoretical concern" and
the alternative plan of a direct, elec
tion offers no more assurance of a
voiding chaos in a decisive race.
Another criticism of the Electoral
College is that electors are not legally
bound to vote for their pledged can
didate. Consequently, there's the pos
sibility for "faithless electors" to dis
tort the outcome of the election. Al
though on the surface this looks like a
grave problem, history has shown the
number of "faithless electors" to be
few.
Only six out of more than 16,000
electors over the 182 years have been
faithless and none have ever altered
the outcome of an election. There is

also an increasing tendency for states
to bind their electors. Electors are cur
rently bound in 16 states.
The unit rule of the Electoral Col
lege (that all of a state's votes be
cast for the presidential candidate re
ceiving a plurality of the state's popu
lar votes) is also highly criticized. The
complaint is that this practice gives
greater voting power to large states.
Again, although this argument seems
legitimate at first, further study reve
als that the Electoral College gives
small states more electoral votes (be
cause of their senatorial representa
tion) and thereby offsets the power of
the larger states. "This (practice) has
been essential to the preservation of
our federal structure," said Ervin.
Protects party system
Specific positive contributions of
the Electoral College include the pre
servation of the two party structure,
the lessening of the possibility of

voter fraud to distort election results,
providing the people with greater
confidence in their president and fi
nally, the Electoral College insures
that a presidential candidate repre
sents a national constituency.
The Electoral College protects the
two party system by discouraging
third party participation unless the
party has enough support to win a
plurality in several states. The direct
election plan, in contrast, could be
highly disruptive to our two party sys
tem because it would encourage small
parties, allowing for the increased
possibility of a president elected by a
smaller proportion of the total electo
rate than is now possible.
The gravity of voter fraud distorting
an election is guarded against by the
Electoral College because it tends to
accentuate the victory margin because
of the unit rule. Consequently,
fraudulent voting at the state level
would have a lesser impact than if the
electoral process were direct popular
vote.
The widened victory margin has
another advantagealso. It has "tended
to secure greater public acceptance of
the new president in the case of close
elections," Ervin said.
One final merit supporting the
maintenance of the status quo is that
the Electoral College ensures national
representation. This is so because it
results from a compromise between
large and small states and is expressly
designed to prevent a concentration
of power to elect a president in any
one region, class or interest group.
According to Sen. James B. Allen ID-
Ala.), "The popular vote under the
Electoral College is always widely
dispersed geographically and
idealogically."
In light of the positive contributions
of the Electoral College to our elec
toral process, its abolition should not
be considered unless dire need is
shown. With all the other
problems confronting our nation, 1
suggest Congress direct its energy to
solving our more pressing needs.
