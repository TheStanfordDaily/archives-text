Yesterday marked the end of the
Main Library parking lot. The lot was
officially closed for good at noon, in
conjunction with groundbreaking
ceremonies for an addition to Main
Library, according to Public Safety Di
rector Marv Herrington.
The new wing, to extend from the
rear of the library toward Galvez
Street, and landscaped grounds
around the wing will replace the lot,
according to Master Planner Oscar
Nelson.
Construction on the wing is ex
pected to take about two years, Her
rington said.
Nearest daytime parking to the lib
rary will be lot H, the Encina tennis
courts lot. This lot was prepared sev
eral years ago in anticipation of the
library additions, Nelson said. At the
time the replacement parking spaces
were built the approximate cost per
stall was $500, compared with a cost of
about $1000 today, he added.
The $7000 coin-operated gate from
the Main Library lot was recently
reinstalled at lot H, Nelson said.
Nelson said students will be asked
not to use the old service road behind
Main Library and the Art building be
cause of construction work..
But the old service road will con
tinue to exist after construction for
services and deliveries to the Hoover
Institution and Cummings Art Build
ing, he said.
Galvez Street between Escondido
and Serra Streets wi 11 al so be closed for
at least two years. Grot hers students
who have parked on Galvez will be
transfered to the Grot hers Memorial lot
on Escondido Road between Grothers
Hall and Branner Hall.
For about two years Galvez will be
used as parking for the construction
workers, Nelson said. He estimated
150-200 workers on the site daily dur
ing different phases of construction.
After the library addition and the
Hoover Memorial Buildings are com
pleted, Nelson said, there are tentative
plans to convert that portion of Galvez
into a landscaped bicycle and pedest
rian area.
Herrington said major construction
has eliminated nearly all parking areas
in the center of campus. The most
central parking areas to remain are lots
at Dinkelspiel, the Law School and En
cina Courts.
