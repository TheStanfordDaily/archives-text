# Western culture: education or ideology?
## 
### 
At the end of the 19605, largely as a
result of a student movement that de
manded, among other things, more
"relevant" education, Stanford's
western civilization requirement was
abolished. Today, it is back, in a new
form: the western culture requirement.
Clearly, the study of history and
societies can be a quite valid and re
warding exercise. Though the ques
tion of whether such study should be
made mandatory is a legitimate one,
there is little point in addressing it
here.
Similarly, it is clear that — given the
degree to which racism pervades U.S.
society, our widespread ignorance of
other peoples and cultures and the
fact that this nation will obviously not
always remain at the apex of the world
system — a requirement in world
civilization would make a lot
more sense than one that simply fo
cuses on the West. But, again, there is
little point in addressing this question
here.
The issue of immediate relevance is:
what will the content of this course in
western culture be? This is no small
question, for much of what passes as
education is, in fact, ideology.
'Barbarism'
You see, if one is honest, one must
come to grips with the fact that, what
ever the benefits of western capitalist
society, it is clear that the historical
evolution of this society consists
largely of a unity of opposites — not
just of progress, but, also, of barbarism:
not just of humankind's elevation, but,
also, of its degradation.
Why barbarism? Why degradation?
Clearly, the chief factor distinguish
ing modern western society from most
other societies in the history of human
civilization has been the seemingly
ever-present quest for profit — in an
cient slave society, in feudalism, but,
above all, in modern capitalist society.
The quest for profit and for a sane
and humane society are all-too
frequently mutually exclusive pur
suits, whatever mystification to the
contrary.
Take, for example, sexism (not to

mention the many years of child
labor). Though, obviously, western
society did not invent the practice of
assymetric relations between the
sexes, it certainly helped to further it.
Indeed, the version of sexism found in
modern capitalist society may well be
the most "dysfunctional" — given our
level of technological advance, etc. —
of any in human history.
Take, for example, colonialism —
one of the west's most remarkable
achievements. More than twenty years
ago, the Negritude poet, Aime Cesaire,
noted that whatever the material re
wards that Europe derived as a result
of the subordination of the colored
peoples of the world, "colonization
works to decivilize the colonizer, to
brutalize him in the true sense of the
word, to degrade him, to awaken him
to buried instincts, to covetousness,
violence, race hatred, and moral re
lativism." To oppress another is to in
evitably decivilize oneself.
Then, there is racism — a phenome
non which is, as I pointed out in an
earlier column (Daily, Jan. 13.)
both historically and "func
tionally" linked to the structure and
dynamics of western capitalist society.
Any course that purports to deal with
western culture but fails to examine
this linkage is a sham — just like the
course that claims to deal with Greek
"democracy" but denies the slavery
that made it possible, or one that
would discuss Greek civilization but
would deny the Egyptian influence.
Finally, there are those phenomena
of the last three decades that many
among us would like to forget: the
massacre of the Jews, the tragedies of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the very real
threat of nuclear holocaust — events
beside which Watergate looks like
child's play.
What we should not forget is that
such monsters as Hitler are not really
aberrations but are direct products of
western society. However distasteful it
may sound, Cesaire is not far off base
when he argues that, without "the very
distinguished, very humanistic, very
Christian bourgeois of the twentieth

century . . . being aware of it, he has a
Hitler inside him, . . . Hitler inhabits
him, . . . Hitler is his demon." Indeed,
it was not the crime against human
kind that turned the west against Hi
tler, but the fact that he possessed suf
ficient effrontery to turn against
Europe herself the techniques reserved
for the "Indians," the "coolies," the
"niggers."

So, in addition to "progress," west
ern civilization has surely had its share
of barbarism and human degradation
— not just occasionally, but rather
consistently.
But it is not simply this primitive
malignancy — this barbarism and
human degradation — that constitutes
the underside of progress in the west.
This underside also consists of such
factors as unrealized potential, of vari
ous contradictions that arise from the
fact that any society based on the reali
zation, and expansion, of profit will in
evitably fail to adequately attend to the
needs of its citizenry.

For example: to adequately attend
to a polluted environment would be to
cut down on profit; contaminating the
air and water is "good business." To
provide adequate health care for us all
would be to cut down on doctors' pro
fits, so the American Medical Associa
tion opposes it. Similarly, to provide
meals and decent education for all
who are in need would be to conflict
with the drive to make a fast buck in
this commodity-oriented society.
Any course that purports to honestly
deal with western culture must, then,
deal with the critique of it. If one
would talk of Hegel and Freud, one
must also come to grips with Marx and
Marcuse. If one would talk of Plato,
then one must extend an open ear to
Memmi and Althusser. If one would
talk of Thomas Jefferson, it would be
both callous and dishonest to ignore
the powerful message of Frantz Fanon.
It would be ridiculous to ignore that of
all the "wretched of the earth," upon
whose backs western civilization was
largely built.
Why? Not just for reasons of moral
ity, but because Mannheim is correct:
there are certain truths about a given
social order that only members of its
oppressed sector can reveal.
One hopes that the new course on
western culture will involve a serious,
and honest, analysis — that it will not
simply be a vehicle for the further
propogation of ideology, as, unhap
pily, such courses usually are.

At the end of the 19605, largely as a
result of a student movement that de
manded, among other things, more
"relevant" education, Stanford's
western civilization requirement was
abolished. Today, it is back, in a new
form: the western culture requirement.
Clearly, the study of history and
societies can be a quite valid and re
warding exercise. Though the ques
tion of whether such study should be
made mandatory is a legitimate one,
there is little point in addressing it
here.
Similarly, it is clear that — given the
degree to which racism pervades U.S.
society, our widespread ignorance of
other peoples and cultures and the
fact that this nation will obviously not
always remain at the apex of the world
system — a requirement in world
civilization would make a lot
more sense than one that simply fo
cuses on the West. But, again, there is
little point in addressing this question
here.
The issue of immediate relevance is:
what will the content of this course in
western culture be? This is no small
question, for much of what passes as
education is, in fact, ideology.
'Barbarism'
You see, if one is honest, one must
come to grips with the fact that, what
ever the benefits of western capitalist
society, it is clear that the historical
evolution of this society consists
largely of a unity of opposites — not
just of progress, but, also, of barbarism:
not just of humankind's elevation, but,
also, of its degradation.
Why barbarism? Why degradation?
Clearly, the chief factor distinguish
ing modern western society from most
other societies in the history of human
civilization has been the seemingly
ever-present quest for profit — in an
cient slave society, in feudalism, but,
above all, in modern capitalist society.
The quest for profit and for a sane
and humane society are all-too
frequently mutually exclusive pur
suits, whatever mystification to the
contrary.
Take, for example, sexism (not to

mention the many years of child
labor). Though, obviously, western
society did not invent the practice of
assymetric relations between the
sexes, it certainly helped to further it.
Indeed, the version of sexism found in
modern capitalist society may well be
the most "dysfunctional" — given our
level of technological advance, etc. —
of any in human history.
Take, for example, colonialism —
one of the west's most remarkable
achievements. More than twenty years
ago, the Negritude poet, Aime Cesaire,
noted that whatever the material re
wards that Europe derived as a result
of the subordination of the colored
peoples of the world, "colonization
works to decivilize the colonizer, to
brutalize him in the true sense of the
word, to degrade him, to awaken him
to buried instincts, to covetousness,
violence, race hatred, and moral re
lativism." To oppress another is to in
evitably decivilize oneself.
Then, there is racism — a phenome
non which is, as I pointed out in an
earlier column (Daily, Jan. 13.)
both historically and "func
tionally" linked to the structure and
dynamics of western capitalist society.
Any course that purports to deal with
western culture but fails to examine
this linkage is a sham — just like the
course that claims to deal with Greek
"democracy" but denies the slavery
that made it possible, or one that
would discuss Greek civilization but
would deny the Egyptian influence.
Finally, there are those phenomena
of the last three decades that many
among us would like to forget: the
massacre of the Jews, the tragedies of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the very real
threat of nuclear holocaust — events
beside which Watergate looks like
child's play.
What we should not forget is that
such monsters as Hitler are not really
aberrations but are direct products of
western society. However distasteful it
may sound, Cesaire is not far off base
when he argues that, without "the very
distinguished, very humanistic, very
Christian bourgeois of the twentieth

century . . . being aware of it, he has a
Hitler inside him, . . . Hitler inhabits
him, . . . Hitler is his demon." Indeed,
it was not the crime against human
kind that turned the west against Hi
tler, but the fact that he possessed suf
ficient effrontery to turn against
Europe herself the techniques reserved
for the "Indians," the "coolies," the
"niggers."

So, in addition to "progress," west
ern civilization has surely had its share
of barbarism and human degradation
— not just occasionally, but rather
consistently.
But it is not simply this primitive
malignancy — this barbarism and
human degradation — that constitutes
the underside of progress in the west.
This underside also consists of such
factors as unrealized potential, of vari
ous contradictions that arise from the
fact that any society based on the reali
zation, and expansion, of profit will in
evitably fail to adequately attend to the
needs of its citizenry.

For example: to adequately attend
to a polluted environment would be to
cut down on profit; contaminating the
air and water is "good business." To
provide adequate health care for us all
would be to cut down on doctors' pro
fits, so the American Medical Associa
tion opposes it. Similarly, to provide
meals and decent education for all
who are in need would be to conflict
with the drive to make a fast buck in
this commodity-oriented society.
Any course that purports to honestly
deal with western culture must, then,
deal with the critique of it. If one
would talk of Hegel and Freud, one
must also come to grips with Marx and
Marcuse. If one would talk of Plato,
then one must extend an open ear to
Memmi and Althusser. If one would
talk of Thomas Jefferson, it would be
both callous and dishonest to ignore
the powerful message of Frantz Fanon.
It would be ridiculous to ignore that of
all the "wretched of the earth," upon
whose backs western civilization was
largely built.
Why? Not just for reasons of moral

who are in need would be to conflict
with the drive to make a fast buck in

deal with the critique of it. If one

Memmi and Althusser. If one would
talk of Thomas Jefferson, it would be
both callous and dishonest to ignore
the powerful message of Frantz Fanon.
It would be ridiculous to ignore that of
all the "wretched of the earth," upon

there are certain truths about a given

At the end of the 19605, largely as a
result of a student movement that de
manded, among other things, more
"relevant" education, Stanford's
western civilization requirement was
abolished. Today, it is back, in a new
form: the western culture requirement.
Clearly, the study of history and
societies can be a quite valid and re
warding exercise. Though the ques
tion of whether such study should be
made mandatory is a legitimate one,
there is little point in addressing it
here.
Similarly, it is clear that — given the
degree to which racism pervades U.S.
society, our widespread ignorance of
other peoples and cultures and the
fact that this nation will obviously not
always remain at the apex of the world
system — a requirement in world
civilization would make a lot
more sense than one that simply fo
cuses on the West. But, again, there is
little point in addressing this question
here.
The issue of immediate relevance is:
what will the content of this course in
western culture be? This is no small
question, for much of what passes as
education is, in fact, ideology.
'Barbarism'
You see, if one is honest, one must
come to grips with the fact that, what
ever the benefits of western capitalist
society, it is clear that the historical
evolution of this society consists
largely of a unity of opposites — not
just of progress, but, also, of barbarism:
not just of humankind's elevation, but,
also, of its degradation.
Why barbarism? Why degradation?
Clearly, the chief factor distinguish
ing modern western society from most
other societies in the history of human
civilization has been the seemingly
ever-present quest for profit — in an
cient slave society, in feudalism, but,
above all, in modern capitalist society.
The quest for profit and for a sane
and humane society are all-too
frequently mutually exclusive pur
suits, whatever mystification to the
contrary.
Take, for example, sexism (not to

mention the many years of child
labor). Though, obviously, western
society did not invent the practice of
assymetric relations between the
sexes, it certainly helped to further it.
Indeed, the version of sexism found in
modern capitalist society may well be
the most "dysfunctional" — given our
level of technological advance, etc. —
of any in human history.
Take, for example, colonialism —
one of the west's most remarkable
achievements. More than twenty years
ago, the Negritude poet, Aime Cesaire,
noted that whatever the material re
wards that Europe derived as a result
of the subordination of the colored
peoples of the world, "colonization
works to decivilize the colonizer, to
brutalize him in the true sense of the
word, to degrade him, to awaken him
to buried instincts, to covetousness,
violence, race hatred, and moral re
lativism." To oppress another is to in
evitably decivilize oneself.
Then, there is racism — a phenome
non which is, as I pointed out in an
earlier column (Daily, Jan. 13.)
both historically and "func
tionally" linked to the structure and
dynamics of western capitalist society.
Any course that purports to deal with
western culture but fails to examine
this linkage is a sham — just like the
course that claims to deal with Greek
"democracy" but denies the slavery
that made it possible, or one that
would discuss Greek civilization but
would deny the Egyptian influence.
Finally, there are those phenomena
of the last three decades that many
among us would like to forget: the
massacre of the Jews, the tragedies of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the very real
threat of nuclear holocaust — events
beside which Watergate looks like
child's play.
What we should not forget is that
such monsters as Hitler are not really
aberrations but are direct products of
western society. However distasteful it
may sound, Cesaire is not far off base
when he argues that, without "the very
distinguished, very humanistic, very
Christian bourgeois of the twentieth

century . . . being aware of it, he has a
Hitler inside him, . . . Hitler inhabits
him, . . . Hitler is his demon." Indeed,
it was not the crime against human
kind that turned the west against Hi
tler, but the fact that he possessed suf
ficient effrontery to turn against
Europe herself the techniques reserved
for the "Indians," the "coolies," the
"niggers."

So, in addition to "progress," west
ern civilization has surely had its share
of barbarism and human degradation
— not just occasionally, but rather
consistently.
But it is not simply this primitive
malignancy — this barbarism and
human degradation — that constitutes
the underside of progress in the west.
This underside also consists of such
factors as unrealized potential, of vari
ous contradictions that arise from the
fact that any society based on the reali
zation, and expansion, of profit will in
evitably fail to adequately attend to the
needs of its citizenry.

For example: to adequately attend
to a polluted environment would be to
cut down on profit; contaminating the
air and water is "good business." To
provide adequate health care for us all
would be to cut down on doctors' pro
fits, so the American Medical Associa
tion opposes it. Similarly, to provide
meals and decent education for all
who are in need would be to conflict
with the drive to make a fast buck in
this commodity-oriented society.
Any course that purports to honestly
