# McCloskey: closer to Carter than to GOP?
## 
### Laura Kennedy 
Pete McCloskey, a maverick in his own Republican
party, may find himself ideologically closer to the new
Democratic administration as he begins his fifth term in
Congress.
McCloskey, who represents constituents from Red
wood City in the north of the 12th congressional district
to Santa Clara in the south, says of Carter, "I can't
think of many areas where I have disagreed with him."
Both McCloskey and Carter want a simplified gov
ernment — in taxes, in welfare, in energy policy — but a
simplification not necessarily by blind elimination of
regulations.
In an interview with the Daily the day after Carter
gave his "fireside chat" to the nation, McCloskey out
lined how he hopes to implement government reform
as he starts his fifth term in Congress.
Here are excerpts from that interview:

Daily: What do you have as
your priorities in the next
Congress?
McCloskey: Well, there are
two aspects to that. One is
that my own committee work
this year will be of major im
portance. I want to divide the
representation of the district
as a whole on the great issues
in front of us from what my
own work is.
I would like to see as
priorities that we simplify the
tax laws. I'd put that maybe
one of the top three priorities.
The most important prior
ity is development of a
natural energy policy. That is
now resolving down into
about 10 or 12 very crucial is
sues — nuclear with at least
three of them, the strip min
ing bill we're going to pass
this year that was vetoed last
year.
Energy policy would rank
No. 1, tax reform No. 2. I
would say restructuring of
government No. 3, which is
simplifying and cutting back
the number of agencies, the
size of agencies. I'd like to see
us repeal about half the law
on the books and make the
laws simple again.
I'm going to put my own
effort into just trying to
simplify the law every time 1
get a chance.
Daily: How does your polit
ical philosophy mesh with
Carter's? What do you disag
ree with him on?
McCloskey: He wants to
simplify'the tax law. I agree
with him on that. He granted
amnesty. I agreed with him
on that. Last week, our MIA
(missing in action) committee
met with him, seven of us,
and suggested that he restore
a friendly relationship with
Vietnam. He agreed that that
was appropriate.

I can't think of very many
areas where I have disagreed
with him. I hope he'll move
with welfare reform, I hope
he'll simplify the tax law . . .
A large public works prog
ram, I'm not so sure that is the
best way to put people to
work ... I think I'd rather go
to a longer-range program.
Daily: What do you think of
Carter's Cabinet appoint
ments?
McCloskey: Well, I don't
have any feelings either way
on Griffin Bell. But with the
exception of Griffin Bell in
the attorney general slot, he
has appointed people of real
quality and reputation and
people who are untarnished.
I like him cutting the White
House staff and the Cabinet
staff and taking the
limousines — that sets a tone
that is much different from
sort of the regal presidencies
under Johnson and Nixon,
and Ford didn't really change
it. I just like the way he's start
ing out. (Carter is) a very good
president. And Lord knows
we need a good president to
get the Congress on track.
The most exciting and en
couraging thing about where
we are right now is that two
thirds of the members of the
House are in their first three
terms. We've gotten rid of the
old leadership or most of it in
the House ... I think it's a
good Congress . . . The
majority is ready to work.
Daily: Congress has just
passed an emergency natural
gas deregulation bill. Last
year, a bill to permanently
deregulate natural gas failed
by a close vote. Do you think
Congress will vote this year
for a permanent deregula
tion?
McCloskey: We've had two
mild winters in a row or we
would have deregulated

(natural gas) by now. 1 don't
think it's a question of
whether we deregulate it or
not, it's just how and in what
increments. But the key to
when we do it and in what
manner really now depends
on Carter presenting the
energy conservation plan that
he discussed in his fireside
chat last night.
Daily: He was still rather
vague about that conserva
tion plan. What kind of things
do you think he's going to in
clude in that?
McClos key .-.Well, we know
kind of the rough outlines of
the program. And I think, in
all fairness to the president,
until he can get his key ap
pointments in place, and the
assistant secretaries and the
general counsels all passed
approval on the advice and
consent of the Senate, that
they really can't come up
with these specific state
ments until they've got their
personnel people in place.
But roughly, I think he'll do

these things: I think we'll see
a horsepower tax on au
tomobiles to penalize undue
use of gasoline. I think we'll
see plans for the insulation
and energy-proofing of
homes that may be paid for
out of utility rates. Certainly
we're going to see Federal
Power Commission legisla
tion to force conservation of
energy as the same goal of the
law and of the regulation that
bringing it to the public at the
lowest possible price has
been in the past.
I would guess that there
will be a gradual increase in
prices — the real ultimate
way to force cpnservation is
to make it more expensive —
and the only thing that has
held that up is the Democratic
majorities in the House and
Senate who have not really
wanted to penalize low
income users or minority
areas or impoverished areas,
which of course get hurt
worst.

And we haven't been able
to figure out a means yet,
without changing the law,
that the users of the basic
amount of energy would pay
a fairly low rate and then
steeply increasing rates for
additional use. But clearly
that will be part of it (Carter's
energy plan).
Daily: So do you think that
would be protection to have a
sort of flat rate for lower
income groups - protection
against sudden rises?
McCloskey: I don't think
you can do it for lower
income groups. We've got to
meet the constitutional re
quirement that everyone gets
equal protection under the
law, so you can't say that poor
people are going tc pay 50
cents per cubin foot of natural
gas and rich people are going
to pay $4. You can say that the
first thousand feet of natural
gas are charged at 50 cents per
cubic foot, and the next
thousand feet at $2, and the

next thousand feet at $20.
I think that kind of ac
celerating utility rate is one
means of accomplishing this,
because that then does put the
burden on people who use
more than their share of
energy.
Daily: Do you think that
part of her energy program
will be gasoline rationing?
McCloskey: Well, there
could be gasoline rationing.
The figures that 1 saw were
that, as I recall, the average
American uses 52 gallons a
month, and if we were to re
duce our dependence on
foreign oil to an appropriate
amount, say 20%, that figure
might be 30 gallons a month
per American. Rationing is
one way of doing that. You
say everybody is going to get
what they need to go back and
forth to work ... I don't think
anybody wants to go to ra
tioning if they can help it.
Daily: Janes Schlesinger
has been suggested for head
ing Carter's proposed Energy
Department, which won sup
port. Because of his
background as a former
Atomic Energy Commission
head, critics have feared he
may push nuclear energy to
the detriment of other fuels. If
his name should come up,
how would you react to his ap
pointment?
McCloskey: I don't know. I
haven't agreed with
Schlesinger in a number of
areas, but I don't think any
one has questioned his com
petence or integrity.
Frankly, whoever is ap
pointed to head of an Energy
Department is going to be —
or should be — somebody
who thoroughly understands
nuclear power.
Nuclear power, rightly or
wrongly, is an essential part
of the mix for the next 30
years, and some of our tough
est energy decisions are:
where do we put nuclear
waste, and do we permit re
cycling nuclear waste, and do
we go with the breeder reac
tor?
Those three questions are
right at the heart of our energy
policy. They're going to be
evolved regardless of what
Mr. Schlesinger's views may
be.
There isn't a member of the
House or the Senate that
doesn't have to reach an in
dependent judgment on those
three issues. They're not
executive policy decisions
any longer. They are deci
sions for the American people

through the Congress to
make.
1 would prefer frankly that
the head of the new Energy
Department be a person not
locked into nuclear as the
necessary means to save the
world. But President Carter
himself has expressed reser
vations about nuclear power
and headlong development of
it, particularly the breeder
reactor, so I wouldn't worry
about a man's past
background and history, if he
has not specific fixed views
that aren't open to new judg
ment.
Daily: What will be on the
agenda for your Government
Operations Committee? Will
you be handling the Sunset
Bill (providing automatic
periodic review of govern
ment agencies)?
McCloskey: The Speaker of
the House decides whether
we get the Sunset Bill . . . We
will get all of the government
reorganization work. The first
issues before the Congress, as
Carter mentioned last night
will be whether Congress will
give him the authority to
reorganize the government.
That bill would have to come
out of my committee. I think a
majority of us on the commit
tee, both Republicans and
Democrats, want to give the
President that authority, but
the chairman of the commit
tee, Jack Brooks, does not.
Daily: So you'd rather have
Carter reorganize the gov
ernment than handle the
mechanics yourself in your
committee.
McCloskey: No, either way
we will handle the
mechanics. But the reorgani
zation authority that the pres
ident has had for many years
enables him to propose a plan
of reorganization, which then
the Congress has 60 days to
approve or reject in toto.
If the Congress proceeds to
reorganize the government,
we run into all our jurisdic
tional conflicts. For example,
the Commerce Committee has
jurisdiction over oceans
policies, the Interior Commit
tee has jurisdiction over
mines on land and wants it in
mining in the ocean. For the
Government Operations
Committee to come in and
say, "Okay, we make the de
cision in favor of Commerce
and against Interior," is much
more difficult to do than to
have the Executive branch
with the President making
the decisions to resolve those
conflicts.

port. Because of his
background as a former
Atomic Energy Commission
head, critics have feared he
may push nuclear energy to
the detriment of other fuels. If
his name should come up,
how would you react to his ap
pointment?
McCloskey: I don't know. I
haven't agreed with
Schlesinger in a number of
areas, but I don't think any
one has questioned his com
petence or integrity.
Frankly, whoever is ap
pointed to head of an Energy
Department is going to be —
or should be — somebody
who thoroughly understands
nuclear power.
Nuclear power, rightly or
wrongly, is an essential part
of the mix for the next 30
years, and some of our tough
est energy decisions are:
where do we put nuclear
waste, and do we permit re
cycling nuclear waste, and do
we go with the breeder reac
tor?
Those three questions are
right at the heart of our energy
policy. They're going to be
evolved regardless of what
Mr. Schlesinger's views may
be.
There isn't a member of the
House or the Senate that
doesn't have to reach an in
dependent judgment on those
three issues. They're not
executive policy decisions
any longer. They are deci
sions for the American people

through the Congress to
make.
1 would prefer frankly that
the head of the new Energy
Department be a person not
locked into nuclear as the
necessary means to save the
world. But President Carter
himself has expressed reser
vations about nuclear power
and headlong development of
it, particularly the breeder
reactor, so I wouldn't worry
about a man's past
background and history, if he
has not specific fixed views
that aren't open to new judg
ment.
Daily: What will be on the
agenda for your Government
Operations Committee? Will
you be handling the Sunset
Bill (providing automatic
periodic review of govern
ment agencies)?
McCloskey: The Speaker of
the House decides whether
we get the Sunset Bill . . . We
will get all of the government
reorganization work. The first
issues before the Congress, as
Carter mentioned last night
will be whether Congress will
give him the authority to
reorganize the government.
That bill would have to come
out of my committee. I think a
majority of us on the commit
tee, both Republicans and
Democrats, want to give the
President that authority, but
the chairman of the commit
tee, Jack Brooks, does not.
Daily: So you'd rather have
Carter reorganize the gov
ernment than handle the
mechanics yourself in your
committee.
McCloskey: No, either way
we will handle the
mechanics. But the reorgani
zation authority that the pres
ident has had for many years
enables him to propose a plan
of reorganization, which then
the Congress has 60 days to
approve or reject in toto.
If the Congress proceeds to
reorganize the government,
we run into all our jurisdic
tional conflicts. For example,
the Commerce Committee has
jurisdiction over oceans
policies, the Interior Commit
tee has jurisdiction over
mines on land and wants it in
mining in the ocean. For the
Government Operations
Committee to come in and
say, "Okay, we make the de
cision in favor of Commerce
and against Interior," is much
more difficult to do than to
have the Executive branch
with the President making
the decisions to resolve those
conflicts.

Pete McCloskey, a maverick in his own Republican
party, may find himself ideologically closer to the new
Democratic administration as he begins his fifth term in
Congress.
McCloskey, who represents constituents from Red
wood City in the north of the 12th congressional district
to Santa Clara in the south, says of Carter, "I can't
think of many areas where I have disagreed with him."
Both McCloskey and Carter want a simplified gov
ernment — in taxes, in welfare, in energy policy — but a
simplification not necessarily by blind elimination of
regulations.
In an interview with the Daily the day after Carter
gave his "fireside chat" to the nation, McCloskey out
lined how he hopes to implement government reform
as he starts his fifth term in Congress.
Here are excerpts from that interview:

Daily: What do you have as
your priorities in the next
Congress?
McCloskey: Well, there are
two aspects to that. One is
that my own committee work
this year will be of major im
portance. I want to divide the
representation of the district
as a whole on the great issues
in front of us from what my
own work is.
I would like to see as
priorities that we simplify the
tax laws. I'd put that maybe
one of the top three priorities.
The most important prior
ity is development of a
natural energy policy. That is
now resolving down into
about 10 or 12 very crucial is
sues — nuclear with at least
three of them, the strip min
ing bill we're going to pass
this year that was vetoed last
year.
Energy policy would rank
No. 1, tax reform No. 2. I
would say restructuring of
government No. 3, which is
simplifying and cutting back
the number of agencies, the
size of agencies. I'd like to see
us repeal about half the law
on the books and make the
laws simple again.
I'm going to put my own
effort into just trying to
simplify the law every time 1
get a chance.
Daily: How does your polit
ical philosophy mesh with
Carter's? What do you disag
ree with him on?
McCloskey: He wants to
simplify'the tax law. I agree
with him on that. He granted
amnesty. I agreed with him
on that. Last week, our MIA
(missing in action) committee
met with him, seven of us,
and suggested that he restore
a friendly relationship with
Vietnam. He agreed that that
was appropriate.

I can't think of very many
areas where I have disagreed
with him. I hope he'll move
with welfare reform, I hope
he'll simplify the tax law . . .
A large public works prog
ram, I'm not so sure that is the
best way to put people to
work ... I think I'd rather go
to a longer-range program.
Daily: What do you think of
Carter's Cabinet appoint
ments?
McCloskey: Well, I don't
have any feelings either way
on Griffin Bell. But with the
exception of Griffin Bell in
the attorney general slot, he
has appointed people of real
quality and reputation and
people who are untarnished.
I like him cutting the White
House staff and the Cabinet
staff and taking the
limousines — that sets a tone
that is much different from
sort of the regal presidencies
under Johnson and Nixon,
and Ford didn't really change
it. I just like the way he's start
ing out. (Carter is) a very good
president. And Lord knows
we need a good president to
get the Congress on track.
The most exciting and en
couraging thing about where
we are right now is that two
thirds of the members of the
House are in their first three
terms. We've gotten rid of the
old leadership or most of it in
the House ... I think it's a
good Congress . . . The
majority is ready to work.
Daily: Congress has just
passed an emergency natural
gas deregulation bill. Last
year, a bill to permanently
deregulate natural gas failed
by a close vote. Do you think
Congress will vote this year
for a permanent deregula
tion?
McCloskey: We've had two
mild winters in a row or we
would have deregulated

(natural gas) by now. 1 don't
think it's a question of
whether we deregulate it or
not, it's just how and in what
increments. But the key to
when we do it and in what
manner really now depends
on Carter presenting the
energy conservation plan that
he discussed in his fireside
chat last night.
Daily: He was still rather
vague about that conserva
tion plan. What kind of things
do you think he's going to in
clude in that?
McClos key .-.Well, we know
kind of the rough outlines of
the program. And I think, in
all fairness to the president,
until he can get his key ap
pointments in place, and the
assistant secretaries and the
general counsels all passed
approval on the advice and
consent of the Senate, that
they really can't come up
with these specific state
ments until they've got their
personnel people in place.
But roughly, I think he'll do

these things: I think we'll see
a horsepower tax on au
tomobiles to penalize undue
use of gasoline. I think we'll
see plans for the insulation
and energy-proofing of
homes that may be paid for
out of utility rates. Certainly
we're going to see Federal
Power Commission legisla
tion to force conservation of
energy as the same goal of the
law and of the regulation that
bringing it to the public at the
lowest possible price has
been in the past.
I would guess that there
will be a gradual increase in
prices — the real ultimate
way to force cpnservation is
to make it more expensive —
and the only thing that has
held that up is the Democratic
majorities in the House and
Senate who have not really
wanted to penalize low
income users or minority
areas or impoverished areas,
which of course get hurt
worst.

And we haven't been able
to figure out a means yet,
without changing the law,
that the users of the basic
amount of energy would pay
a fairly low rate and then
steeply increasing rates for
additional use. But clearly
that will be part of it (Carter's
energy plan).
Daily: So do you think that
would be protection to have a
sort of flat rate for lower
income groups - protection
against sudden rises?
McCloskey: I don't think
you can do it for lower
income groups. We've got to
meet the constitutional re
quirement that everyone gets
equal protection under the
law, so you can't say that poor
people are going tc pay 50
cents per cubin foot of natural
gas and rich people are going
to pay $4. You can say that the
first thousand feet of natural
gas are charged at 50 cents per
cubic foot, and the next
thousand feet at $2, and the

next thousand feet at $20.
I think that kind of ac
celerating utility rate is one
means of accomplishing this,
because that then does put the
burden on people who use
more than their share of
energy.
Daily: Do you think that
part of her energy program
will be gasoline rationing?
McCloskey: Well, there
could be gasoline rationing.
The figures that 1 saw were
that, as I recall, the average
American uses 52 gallons a
month, and if we were to re
duce our dependence on
foreign oil to an appropriate
amount, say 20%, that figure
might be 30 gallons a month
per American. Rationing is
one way of doing that. You
say everybody is going to get
what they need to go back and
forth to work ... I don't think
anybody wants to go to ra
tioning if they can help it.
Daily: Janes Schlesinger
has been suggested for head
ing Carter's proposed Energy
Department, which won sup
port. Because of his
background as a former
Atomic Energy Commission
head, critics have feared he
may push nuclear energy to
the detriment of other fuels. If

tion plan. What kind of things
do you think he's going to in
clude in that?
McClos key .-.Well, we know
kind of the rough outlines of
the program. And I think, in
all fairness to the president,
until he can get his key ap
pointments in place, and the
assistant secretaries and the
general counsels all passed
approval on the advice and
consent of the Senate, that
they really can't come up
with these specific state
ments until they've got their
personnel people in place.
But roughly, I think he'll do

these things: I think we'll see
a horsepower tax on au
tomobiles to penalize undue
use of gasoline. I think we'll
see plans for the insulation
and energy-proofing of
homes that may be paid for
out of utility rates. Certainly
we're going to see Federal
Power Commission legisla
tion to force conservation of
energy as the same goal of the
law and of the regulation that
bringing it to the public at the
lowest possible price has
been in the past.
I would guess that there
will be a gradual increase in
prices — the real ultimate
way to force cpnservation is
to make it more expensive —
and the only thing that has
held that up is the Democratic
majorities in the House and
Senate who have not really
wanted to penalize low
income users or minority
areas or impoverished areas,
which of course get hurt
worst.

And we haven't been able
to figure out a means yet,
without changing the law,
that the users of the basic
amount of energy would pay
a fairly low rate and then
steeply increasing rates for
additional use. But clearly
that will be part of it (Carter's
energy plan).
Daily: So do you think that
would be protection to have a
sort of flat rate for lower
income groups - protection
against sudden rises?
McCloskey: I don't think
you can do it for lower
income groups. We've got to
meet the constitutional re
quirement that everyone gets
equal protection under the
law, so you can't say that poor
people are going tc pay 50
cents per cubin foot of natural
gas and rich people are going
to pay $4. You can say that the
first thousand feet of natural
gas are charged at 50 cents per
cubic foot, and the next
thousand feet at $2, and the

next thousand feet at $20.
I think that kind of ac
celerating utility rate is one
means of accomplishing this,
because that then does put the
burden on people who use
more than their share of
energy.
Daily: Do you think that
part of her energy program
will be gasoline rationing?
McCloskey: Well, there
could be gasoline rationing.
The figures that 1 saw were
that, as I recall, the average
American uses 52 gallons a
month, and if we were to re
duce our dependence on
foreign oil to an appropriate
amount, say 20%, that figure
might be 30 gallons a month
per American. Rationing is
one way of doing that. You
say everybody is going to get
what they need to go back and
forth to work ... I don't think
anybody wants to go to ra
tioning if they can help it.
Daily: Janes Schlesinger
has been suggested for head
ing Carter's proposed Energy
Department, which won sup
port. Because of his
background as a former
Atomic Energy Commission
head, critics have feared he
may push nuclear energy to
the detriment of other fuels. If
his name should come up,
how would you react to his ap
pointment?
McCloskey: I don't know. I
haven't agreed with
Schlesinger in a number of
areas, but I don't think any
one has questioned his com
petence or integrity.
Frankly, whoever is ap
pointed to head of an Energy
Department is going to be —
or should be — somebody
who thoroughly understands
nuclear power.
Nuclear power, rightly or
wrongly, is an essential part
of the mix for the next 30
years, and some of our tough
est energy decisions are:
where do we put nuclear
waste, and do we permit re
cycling nuclear waste, and do
we go with the breeder reac
tor?
Those three questions are
right at the heart of our energy
policy. They're going to be
evolved regardless of what
Mr. Schlesinger's views may
be.
There isn't a member of the
House or the Senate that
doesn't have to reach an in
dependent judgment on those
three issues. They're not
executive policy decisions
any longer. They are deci
sions for the American people

through the Congress to
make.
1 would prefer frankly that
the head of the new Energy
Department be a person not
locked into nuclear as the
necessary means to save the
world. But President Carter
himself has expressed reser
vations about nuclear power
and headlong development of
it, particularly the breeder
reactor, so I wouldn't worry
about a man's past
background and history, if he
has not specific fixed views
that aren't open to new judg
ment.
Daily: What will be on the
agenda for your Government
Operations Committee? Will
you be handling the Sunset
Bill (providing automatic
periodic review of govern
ment agencies)?
McCloskey: The Speaker of
the House decides whether
we get the Sunset Bill . . . We
will get all of the government
reorganization work. The first
issues before the Congress, as
Carter mentioned last night
will be whether Congress will
give him the authority to
reorganize the government.
That bill would have to come
out of my committee. I think a
majority of us on the commit
tee, both Republicans and
Democrats, want to give the
President that authority, but
the chairman of the commit
tee, Jack Brooks, does not.
Daily: So you'd rather have
Carter reorganize the gov
ernment than handle the
mechanics yourself in your
committee.
McCloskey: No, either way
we will handle the
mechanics. But the reorgani
zation authority that the pres
ident has had for many years
enables him to propose a plan
of reorganization, which then
the Congress has 60 days to
approve or reject in toto.
If the Congress proceeds to
reorganize the government,
we run into all our jurisdic
tional conflicts. For example,
the Commerce Committee has
jurisdiction over oceans
policies, the Interior Commit
tee has jurisdiction over
mines on land and wants it in
mining in the ocean. For the
Government Operations
Committee to come in and
say, "Okay, we make the de
cision in favor of Commerce
and against Interior," is much
more difficult to do than to
have the Executive branch
with the President making
the decisions to resolve those
conflicts.

Pete McCloskey, a maverick in his own Republican
party, may find himself ideologically closer to the new
Democratic administration as he begins his fifth term in
Congress.
McCloskey, who represents constituents from Red
wood City in the north of the 12th congressional district
to Santa Clara in the south, says of Carter, "I can't
think of many areas where I have disagreed with him."
Both McCloskey and Carter want a simplified gov
ernment — in taxes, in welfare, in energy policy — but a
simplification not necessarily by blind elimination of
regulations.
In an interview with the Daily the day after Carter
gave his "fireside chat" to the nation, McCloskey out
lined how he hopes to implement government reform
as he starts his fifth term in Congress.
Here are excerpts from that interview:

Daily: What do you have as
your priorities in the next
Congress?
McCloskey: Well, there are
two aspects to that. One is
that my own committee work
this year will be of major im
portance. I want to divide the
representation of the district
as a whole on the great issues
in front of us from what my
own work is.
I would like to see as
priorities that we simplify the
tax laws. I'd put that maybe
one of the top three priorities.
The most important prior
ity is development of a
natural energy policy. That is
now resolving down into
about 10 or 12 very crucial is
sues — nuclear with at least
three of them, the strip min
ing bill we're going to pass
this year that was vetoed last
year.
Energy policy would rank
No. 1, tax reform No. 2. I
would say restructuring of
government No. 3, which is
simplifying and cutting back
the number of agencies, the
size of agencies. I'd like to see
us repeal about half the law
on the books and make the
laws simple again.
I'm going to put my own
effort into just trying to
simplify the law every time 1
get a chance.
Daily: How does your polit
ical philosophy mesh with
Carter's? What do you disag
ree with him on?
McCloskey: He wants to
simplify'the tax law. I agree
with him on that. He granted
amnesty. I agreed with him
on that. Last week, our MIA
(missing in action) committee
met with him, seven of us,
and suggested that he restore
a friendly relationship with
Vietnam. He agreed that that
was appropriate.

I can't think of very many
areas where I have disagreed
with him. I hope he'll move
with welfare reform, I hope
he'll simplify the tax law . . .
A large public works prog
ram, I'm not so sure that is the
best way to put people to
work ... I think I'd rather go
to a longer-range program.
Daily: What do you think of
Carter's Cabinet appoint
ments?
McCloskey: Well, I don't
have any feelings either way
on Griffin Bell. But with the
exception of Griffin Bell in
the attorney general slot, he
has appointed people of real
quality and reputation and
people who are untarnished.
I like him cutting the White
House staff and the Cabinet
staff and taking the
limousines — that sets a tone
that is much different from
sort of the regal presidencies
under Johnson and Nixon,
and Ford didn't really change
it. I just like the way he's start
ing out. (Carter is) a very good
president. And Lord knows
we need a good president to
get the Congress on track.
The most exciting and en
couraging thing about where
we are right now is that two
thirds of the members of the
House are in their first three
terms. We've gotten rid of the
old leadership or most of it in
the House ... I think it's a
good Congress . . . The
majority is ready to work.
Daily: Congress has just
passed an emergency natural
gas deregulation bill. Last
year, a bill to permanently
deregulate natural gas failed
by a close vote. Do you think
Congress will vote this year
for a permanent deregula
tion?
McCloskey: We've had two
mild winters in a row or we
would have deregulated

(natural gas) by now. 1 don't
think it's a question of
whether we deregulate it or
not, it's just how and in what
increments. But the key to
when we do it and in what
manner really now depends
on Carter presenting the
energy conservation plan that
he discussed in his fireside
chat last night.
Daily: He was still rather
vague about that conserva
tion plan. What kind of things
do you think he's going to in
clude in that?
McClos key .-.Well, we know

The most important prior
ity is development of a
natural energy policy. That is
now resolving down into
about 10 or 12 very crucial is
sues — nuclear with at least
three of them, the strip min
ing bill we're going to pass
this year that was vetoed last
year.
Energy policy would rank
No. 1, tax reform No. 2. I
would say restructuring of
government No. 3, which is
simplifying and cutting back
the number of agencies, the
size of agencies. I'd like to see
us repeal about half the law
on the books and make the
laws simple again.
I'm going to put my own
effort into just trying to
simplify the law every time 1
get a chance.
Daily: How does your polit
ical philosophy mesh with
Carter's? What do you disag
ree with him on?
McCloskey: He wants to
simplify'the tax law. I agree
with him on that. He granted
amnesty. I agreed with him
on that. Last week, our MIA
(missing in action) committee
met with him, seven of us,
and suggested that he restore
a friendly relationship with
Vietnam. He agreed that that
was appropriate.

I can't think of very many
areas where I have disagreed
with him. I hope he'll move
with welfare reform, I hope
he'll simplify the tax law . . .
A large public works prog
ram, I'm not so sure that is the
best way to put people to
work ... I think I'd rather go
to a longer-range program.
Daily: What do you think of
Carter's Cabinet appoint
ments?
McCloskey: Well, I don't
have any feelings either way
on Griffin Bell. But with the
exception of Griffin Bell in
the attorney general slot, he
has appointed people of real
quality and reputation and
people who are untarnished.
I like him cutting the White
House staff and the Cabinet
staff and taking the
limousines — that sets a tone
that is much different from
sort of the regal presidencies
under Johnson and Nixon,
and Ford didn't really change
it. I just like the way he's start
ing out. (Carter is) a very good
president. And Lord knows
we need a good president to
get the Congress on track.
The most exciting and en
couraging thing about where
we are right now is that two
thirds of the members of the
House are in their first three
terms. We've gotten rid of the
old leadership or most of it in
the House ... I think it's a
good Congress . . . The
majority is ready to work.
Daily: Congress has just
passed an emergency natural
gas deregulation bill. Last
year, a bill to permanently
deregulate natural gas failed
by a close vote. Do you think
Congress will vote this year
for a permanent deregula
tion?
McCloskey: We've had two
mild winters in a row or we
would have deregulated

(natural gas) by now. 1 don't
think it's a question of
whether we deregulate it or
not, it's just how and in what
increments. But the key to
when we do it and in what
manner really now depends
on Carter presenting the
energy conservation plan that
he discussed in his fireside
chat last night.
Daily: He was still rather
vague about that conserva
tion plan. What kind of things
do you think he's going to in
clude in that?
McClos key .-.Well, we know
kind of the rough outlines of
the program. And I think, in
all fairness to the president,
until he can get his key ap
pointments in place, and the
assistant secretaries and the
general counsels all passed
approval on the advice and
consent of the Senate, that
they really can't come up
with these specific state
ments until they've got their
personnel people in place.
But roughly, I think he'll do

these things: I think we'll see
a horsepower tax on au
tomobiles to penalize undue
use of gasoline. I think we'll
see plans for the insulation
and energy-proofing of
homes that may be paid for
out of utility rates. Certainly
we're going to see Federal
Power Commission legisla
tion to force conservation of
energy as the same goal of the
law and of the regulation that
bringing it to the public at the
lowest possible price has
been in the past.
I would guess that there
will be a gradual increase in
prices — the real ultimate
way to force cpnservation is
to make it more expensive —
and the only thing that has
held that up is the Democratic
majorities in the House and
Senate who have not really
wanted to penalize low
income users or minority
areas or impoverished areas,
which of course get hurt
worst.

And we haven't been able
to figure out a means yet,
without changing the law,
that the users of the basic
amount of energy would pay
a fairly low rate and then
steeply increasing rates for
additional use. But clearly
that will be part of it (Carter's
energy plan).
Daily: So do you think that
would be protection to have a
sort of flat rate for lower
income groups - protection
against sudden rises?
McCloskey: I don't think
you can do it for lower
income groups. We've got to
meet the constitutional re
quirement that everyone gets
equal protection under the
law, so you can't say that poor
people are going tc pay 50
cents per cubin foot of natural
gas and rich people are going
to pay $4. You can say that the
first thousand feet of natural
gas are charged at 50 cents per
cubic foot, and the next
thousand feet at $2, and the

next thousand feet at $20.
I think that kind of ac
celerating utility rate is one
means of accomplishing this,
because that then does put the
burden on people who use
more than their share of
energy.
Daily: Do you think that
part of her energy program
will be gasoline rationing?
McCloskey: Well, there
could be gasoline rationing.
The figures that 1 saw were
that, as I recall, the average
American uses 52 gallons a
month, and if we were to re
duce our dependence on
foreign oil to an appropriate
amount, say 20%, that figure
might be 30 gallons a month
per American. Rationing is
one way of doing that. You
say everybody is going to get
what they need to go back and
forth to work ... I don't think
anybody wants to go to ra
tioning if they can help it.
Daily: Janes Schlesinger
has been suggested for head
ing Carter's proposed Energy
Department, which won sup
port. Because of his
background as a former
Atomic Energy Commission
head, critics have feared he
may push nuclear energy to
the detriment of other fuels. If
his name should come up,
how would you react to his ap
pointment?
McCloskey: I don't know. I
haven't agreed with
Schlesinger in a number of
areas, but I don't think any
one has questioned his com
petence or integrity.
Frankly, whoever is ap
pointed to head of an Energy
Department is going to be —
or should be — somebody
who thoroughly understands
nuclear power.
Nuclear power, rightly or
wrongly, is an essential part
of the mix for the next 30
years, and some of our tough
est energy decisions are:
where do we put nuclear
waste, and do we permit re
cycling nuclear waste, and do
we go with the breeder reac
tor?
Those three questions are
right at the heart of our energy
policy. They're going to be
evolved regardless of what
Mr. Schlesinger's views may
be.
There isn't a member of the
House or the Senate that
doesn't have to reach an in
dependent judgment on those
three issues. They're not
executive policy decisions
any longer. They are deci
sions for the American people

through the Congress to
make.
1 would prefer frankly that
the head of the new Energy
Department be a person not
locked into nuclear as the
necessary means to save the
world. But President Carter
himself has expressed reser
vations about nuclear power
and headlong development of
it, particularly the breeder
reactor, so I wouldn't worry
about a man's past
background and history, if he
has not specific fixed views
that aren't open to new judg
ment.
Daily: What will be on the
agenda for your Government
Operations Committee? Will
you be handling the Sunset
Bill (providing automatic
periodic review of govern
ment agencies)?
McCloskey: The Speaker of
the House decides whether
we get the Sunset Bill . . . We
will get all of the government
reorganization work. The first
issues before the Congress, as
Carter mentioned last night
will be whether Congress will
give him the authority to
reorganize the government.
That bill would have to come
out of my committee. I think a
majority of us on the commit
tee, both Republicans and
Democrats, want to give the
President that authority, but
the chairman of the commit
tee, Jack Brooks, does not.
Daily: So you'd rather have
Carter reorganize the gov
ernment than handle the
mechanics yourself in your
committee.
McCloskey: No, either way
we will handle the
mechanics. But the reorgani
zation authority that the pres
ident has had for many years
enables him to propose a plan
of reorganization, which then
the Congress has 60 days to
approve or reject in toto.
If the Congress proceeds to
reorganize the government,
we run into all our jurisdic
tional conflicts. For example,
the Commerce Committee has
jurisdiction over oceans
policies, the Interior Commit
tee has jurisdiction over
mines on land and wants it in
mining in the ocean. For the
Government Operations
Committee to come in and
say, "Okay, we make the de
cision in favor of Commerce
and against Interior," is much
more difficult to do than to
have the Executive branch
with the President making
the decisions to resolve those
conflicts.

Pete McCloskey, a maverick in his own Republican
party, may find himself ideologically closer to the new
Democratic administration as he begins his fifth term in
Congress.
McCloskey, who represents constituents from Red
wood City in the north of the 12th congressional district
to Santa Clara in the south, says of Carter, "I can't
think of many areas where I have disagreed with him."
Both McCloskey and Carter want a simplified gov
ernment — in taxes, in welfare, in energy policy — but a
simplification not necessarily by blind elimination of
regulations.
In an interview with the Daily the day after Carter
gave his "fireside chat" to the nation, McCloskey out
lined how he hopes to implement government reform
as he starts his fifth term in Congress.
Here are excerpts from that interview:

Daily: What do you have as
your priorities in the next
Congress?
McCloskey: Well, there are
two aspects to that. One is
that my own committee work
this year will be of major im
portance. I want to divide the
representation of the district
as a whole on the great issues
in front of us from what my
own work is.
I would like to see as
priorities that we simplify the
tax laws. I'd put that maybe
one of the top three priorities.
The most important prior
ity is development of a
natural energy policy. That is

sions for the American people

through the Congress to
make.
1 would prefer frankly that
the head of the new Energy
Department be a person not
locked into nuclear as the
necessary means to save the
world. But President Carter
himself has expressed reser
vations about nuclear power
and headlong development of
it, particularly the breeder
reactor, so I wouldn't worry
about a man's past
background and history, if he
has not specific fixed views
that aren't open to new judg
ment.
Daily: What will be on the
agenda for your Government
Operations Committee? Will
you be handling the Sunset
Bill (providing automatic
periodic review of govern
ment agencies)?
McCloskey: The Speaker of
the House decides whether
we get the Sunset Bill . . . We
will get all of the government
reorganization work. The first
issues before the Congress, as
Carter mentioned last night
will be whether Congress will
give him the authority to
reorganize the government.
That bill would have to come
out of my committee. I think a
majority of us on the commit
tee, both Republicans and
Democrats, want to give the
President that authority, but
the chairman of the commit
tee, Jack Brooks, does not.
Daily: So you'd rather have
Carter reorganize the gov
ernment than handle the
mechanics yourself in your
committee.
McCloskey: No, either way
we will handle the
mechanics. But the reorgani
zation authority that the pres
ident has had for many years
enables him to propose a plan
of reorganization, which then
the Congress has 60 days to
approve or reject in toto.
If the Congress proceeds to
reorganize the government,
we run into all our jurisdic
tional conflicts. For example,
the Commerce Committee has
jurisdiction over oceans
policies, the Interior Commit
tee has jurisdiction over
mines on land and wants it in
mining in the ocean. For the
Government Operations
Committee to come in and
say, "Okay, we make the de
cision in favor of Commerce
and against Interior," is much
more difficult to do than to
have the Executive branch
with the President making
the decisions to resolve those
conflicts.

Pete McCloskey, a maverick in his own Republican
party, may find himself ideologically closer to the new
Democratic administration as he begins his fifth term in
Congress.
McCloskey, who represents constituents from Red
wood City in the north of the 12th congressional district
to Santa Clara in the south, says of Carter, "I can't
think of many areas where I have disagreed with him."
Both McCloskey and Carter want a simplified gov
ernment — in taxes, in welfare, in energy policy — but a
simplification not necessarily by blind elimination of
regulations.
In an interview with the Daily the day after Carter
gave his "fireside chat" to the nation, McCloskey out
lined how he hopes to implement government reform
as he starts his fifth term in Congress.
Here are excerpts from that interview:

Daily: What do you have as
your priorities in the next
Congress?
McCloskey: Well, there are
two aspects to that. One is
that my own committee work
this year will be of major im
portance. I want to divide the
representation of the district
as a whole on the great issues
in front of us from what my
own work is.
I would like to see as
priorities that we simplify the
tax laws. I'd put that maybe
one of the top three priorities.
The most important prior
ity is development of a
natural energy policy. That is
now resolving down into
about 10 or 12 very crucial is
sues — nuclear with at least
three of them, the strip min
ing bill we're going to pass
this year that was vetoed last
year.
Energy policy would rank
No. 1, tax reform No. 2. I
would say restructuring of
government No. 3, which is
simplifying and cutting back
the number of agencies, the
size of agencies. I'd like to see
us repeal about half the law
on the books and make the
laws simple again.
I'm going to put my own
effort into just trying to
simplify the law every time 1
get a chance.
Daily: How does your polit
ical philosophy mesh with
Carter's? What do you disag
ree with him on?
McCloskey: He wants to
simplify'the tax law. I agree
with him on that. He granted
amnesty. I agreed with him
on that. Last week, our MIA
(missing in action) committee
met with him, seven of us,
and suggested that he restore
a friendly relationship with
Vietnam. He agreed that that
was appropriate.

I can't think of very many
areas where I have disagreed
with him. I hope he'll move
with welfare reform, I hope
he'll simplify the tax law . . .
A large public works prog
ram, I'm not so sure that is the
best way to put people to
work ... I think I'd rather go
to a longer-range program.
Daily: What do you think of
Carter's Cabinet appoint
ments?
McCloskey: Well, I don't
have any feelings either way
on Griffin Bell. But with the
exception of Griffin Bell in
the attorney general slot, he
has appointed people of real
quality and reputation and
people who are untarnished.
I like him cutting the White
House staff and the Cabinet
staff and taking the
limousines — that sets a tone
that is much different from
sort of the regal presidencies
under Johnson and Nixon,
and Ford didn't really change
it. I just like the way he's start
ing out. (Carter is) a very good
president. And Lord knows
we need a good president to
get the Congress on track.
The most exciting and en
couraging thing about where
we are right now is that two
thirds of the members of the
House are in their first three
terms. We've gotten rid of the
old leadership or most of it in
the House ... I think it's a
good Congress . . . The
majority is ready to work.
Daily: Congress has just
passed an emergency natural
gas deregulation bill. Last
year, a bill to permanently
deregulate natural gas failed
by a close vote. Do you think
Congress will vote this year
for a permanent deregula
tion?
McCloskey: We've had two
mild winters in a row or we
would have deregulated

(natural gas) by now. 1 don't
think it's a question of
whether we deregulate it or
not, it's just how and in what
increments. But the key to
when we do it and in what
manner really now depends
on Carter presenting the
energy conservation plan that
he discussed in his fireside
chat last night.
Daily: He was still rather
vague about that conserva
tion plan. What kind of things
do you think he's going to in
clude in that?
McClos key .-.Well, we know
kind of the rough outlines of
the program. And I think, in
all fairness to the president,
until he can get his key ap
pointments in place, and the
assistant secretaries and the
general counsels all passed
approval on the advice and
consent of the Senate, that
they really can't come up
with these specific state
ments until they've got their
personnel people in place.
But roughly, I think he'll do

these things: I think we'll see
a horsepower tax on au
tomobiles to penalize undue
use of gasoline. I think we'll
see plans for the insulation
and energy-proofing of
homes that may be paid for
out of utility rates. Certainly
we're going to see Federal
Power Commission legisla
tion to force conservation of
energy as the same goal of the
law and of the regulation that
bringing it to the public at the
lowest possible price has
been in the past.
I would guess that there
will be a gradual increase in
prices — the real ultimate
way to force cpnservation is
to make it more expensive —
and the only thing that has
held that up is the Democratic
majorities in the House and
Senate who have not really
wanted to penalize low
income users or minority
areas or impoverished areas,
which of course get hurt
worst.

And we haven't been able
to figure out a means yet,
without changing the law,
that the users of the basic
amount of energy would pay
a fairly low rate and then
steeply increasing rates for
additional use. But clearly
that will be part of it (Carter's
energy plan).
Daily: So do you think that
would be protection to have a
sort of flat rate for lower
income groups - protection
against sudden rises?
McCloskey: I don't think
you can do it for lower
income groups. We've got to
meet the constitutional re
quirement that everyone gets
equal protection under the
law, so you can't say that poor
people are going tc pay 50
cents per cubin foot of natural
gas and rich people are going
to pay $4. You can say that the
first thousand feet of natural
gas are charged at 50 cents per
cubic foot, and the next
thousand feet at $2, and the

next thousand feet at $20.
I think that kind of ac
celerating utility rate is one
means of accomplishing this,
because that then does put the
burden on people who use
more than their share of
energy.
Daily: Do you think that
part of her energy program
will be gasoline rationing?
McCloskey: Well, there
could be gasoline rationing.
The figures that 1 saw were
that, as I recall, the average
American uses 52 gallons a
month, and if we were to re
duce our dependence on
foreign oil to an appropriate
amount, say 20%, that figure
might be 30 gallons a month
per American. Rationing is
one way of doing that. You
say everybody is going to get
what they need to go back and
forth to work ... I don't think
anybody wants to go to ra
tioning if they can help it.
Daily: Janes Schlesinger
has been suggested for head
ing Carter's proposed Energy
Department, which won sup
port. Because of his
background as a former
Atomic Energy Commission
head, critics have feared he
may push nuclear energy to
the detriment of other fuels. If
his name should come up,
how would you react to his ap
pointment?
McCloskey: I don't know. I
haven't agreed with
Schlesinger in a number of
areas, but I don't think any
one has questioned his com
petence or integrity.
Frankly, whoever is ap
pointed to head of an Energy
Department is going to be —
or should be — somebody
who thoroughly understands
nuclear power.
Nuclear power, rightly or
wrongly, is an essential part
of the mix for the next 30
years, and some of our tough
est energy decisions are:
where do we put nuclear
waste, and do we permit re
cycling nuclear waste, and do
we go with the breeder reac
tor?
Those three questions are
right at the heart of our energy
policy. They're going to be
evolved regardless of what
Mr. Schlesinger's views may
be.
There isn't a member of the
House or the Senate that
doesn't have to reach an in
dependent judgment on those
three issues. They're not
executive policy decisions
any longer. They are deci
sions for the American people

through the Congress to
make.
1 would prefer frankly that
