Why does Meyer have just two Xerox machines
I plus one in the cellar)? They are always busy and
very often monopolized. Worst of all, a lot of the
time the people using them are not even Stanford
students. I think that it is grossly inefficient.
-J.W.
Although there is some "queueing up" at the
end of the quarter, "for a greater percentage of the
time, the number of machines in Meyer are
adequate," says Mike Jalone, the libraries' chief of
business services.
Besides, what's wrong with a little walking?
Right next door, in Main Library, are five machines
just waiting for your money. And there is also a
Xerox machine in the Education building.
But if you've really got the blahs and just can't
hack walking all that way, try the machine in the
UGLY basement. Jalone confides "the volume is
usually very, very low."

Campus Report has stopped publishing the lists
of Housing Wanted and Housing Available/or the
Stanford community.
I have made the obvious phone calls and
everyone agrees that this valuable service should
be restored —even if it requires a paid subscription.
In the meantime, faculty and staff as well as
visitors are spinning their wheels and tearing their
hair trying to do what used to be a fairly simple
operation -find housing for long or short periods.
How long will it take the "administration" to
come up with a solution? The Peter Principle is at
work!

According to News Service Director Bob Beyers,
"until those who benefit from the service share in
its cost, there will be no workable way to restore its
use." He assures that some kind of arrangement is
being sought. In the meantime, why don't you try
some of the other forms of available advertising —
like the Daily?
