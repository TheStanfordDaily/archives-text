# Upset notes experts' failure to predict future of humanity
## 
### Michael Molyneux 
Few may be as qualified to predict
America's future as Seymour Martin
Upset, professor of political science
and sociology.
But in a speech to more than 300
persons in Bishop Auditorium last
night, Lipset stressed the inability of
social scientists to make valid, exten
sive predictions.
The senior Hoover Institution Fel
low said, however, that he was making

"not a confession of failure, but a de
claration of independence. Man is still
free to make his own history."
Lipset warned government not to
"listen to people just because they
come wearing Ph.D.'s in politics,
sociology or economics."
The assumptions of politicians, Lip
set said, can be as important as the
theories behind them.
As a case in point, he referred to Gov.
Edmund "Jerry" Brown's espousal of a

"limited growth" philosophy. Lipset
contrasted this "pessimism" to a
counter argument that "necessity is
the mother of invention."
The former view predicts an exhaus
tion of resources, with social upheav
als to follow. Another prediction
might be, Lipset said, that "if we halt
or sharply reduce growth, we con
demn most of the world to poverty."
"It is not likely that this argument
will be resolved in the near future,"
Lipset concluded.
The uncertainty of prediction "does
not mean we should not try to analyze
or predict," said Lipset. But he urged
his colleagues to "be humble, cauti
ous, know more than we do, before
recommending what we should do."
Lipset prefaced this admonition by
recalling past mispredictions of
economists, demographers,
sociologists and political scientists.
Lipset listed the following predic
tions as ones scholars might like to
forget:
—fears that a massive depression
would follow World War II;
—estimates of "steady decline in
population growth," made just before
the "Baby Boom of the 1950s";
—predictions that the social con
formity of the 1950s would continue
into the 19605;
—estimates that social mobility
would decline steadily. "There are
more Horatio Alger stories now than
ever before," Lipset maintained;
—projections of a decline in ethnic
identity, just before the recent re
surgence in ethnic consciousness; and
—assumptions that "sex cannot be a
source of political difference."
Though all these estimates were
made by non-radical scholars, Lipset
argued that "Marxism is in no better
shape."
He said that before World War I,
"Marxists assumed that the United
States would be the first nation to go
socialist."
Lipset's speech was one of a 17-part
series cn "America as a Post-Industrial
oociety." Lipset himself is coordinator
of the series.

record in predicting society's fate. But, he said, that fact in itself may allow
man to control his own history.

counter argument that "necessity is
the mother of invention."
The former view predicts an exhaus
tion of resources, with social upheav
als to follow. Another prediction
might be, Lipset said, that "if we halt
or sharply reduce growth, we con
demn most of the world to poverty."
"It is not likely that this argument
will be resolved in the near future,"
Lipset concluded.
The uncertainty of prediction "does
not mean we should not try to analyze
or predict," said Lipset. But he urged
his colleagues to "be humble, cauti
ous, know more than we do, before
recommending what we should do."
Lipset prefaced this admonition by
recalling past mispredictions of
economists, demographers,
sociologists and political scientists.
Lipset listed the following predic
tions as ones scholars might like to
forget:
—fears that a massive depression
would follow World War II;
—estimates of "steady decline in
population growth," made just before
the "Baby Boom of the 1950s";
—predictions that the social con
formity of the 1950s would continue
into the 19605;
—estimates that social mobility
would decline steadily. "There are
more Horatio Alger stories now than
ever before," Lipset maintained;
—projections of a decline in ethnic
identity, just before the recent re
surgence in ethnic consciousness; and
—assumptions that "sex cannot be a
source of political difference."
Though all these estimates were
made by non-radical scholars, Lipset
argued that "Marxism is in no better
shape."
He said that before World War I,
"Marxists assumed that the United
States would be the first nation to go
socialist."
Lipset's speech was one of a 17-part
series cn "America as a Post-Industrial
oociety." Lipset himself is coordinator
of the series.

Senior Hoover Institution Fellow Seymour Martin Lipset told a crowd in
Bishop Auditorium last night that social scientists haven't had much of a
record in predicting society's fate. But, he said, that fact in itself may allow
man to control his own history.
Few may be as qualified to predict
America's future as Seymour Martin
Upset, professor of political science
and sociology.
But in a speech to more than 300
persons in Bishop Auditorium last
night, Lipset stressed the inability of
social scientists to make valid, exten
sive predictions.
The senior Hoover Institution Fel
low said, however, that he was making

"not a confession of failure, but a de
claration of independence. Man is still
free to make his own history."
Lipset warned government not to
"listen to people just because they
come wearing Ph.D.'s in politics,
sociology or economics."
The assumptions of politicians, Lip
set said, can be as important as the
theories behind them.
As a case in point, he referred to Gov.
Edmund "Jerry" Brown's espousal of a

"limited growth" philosophy. Lipset
contrasted this "pessimism" to a
counter argument that "necessity is
the mother of invention."
The former view predicts an exhaus
tion of resources, with social upheav
als to follow. Another prediction
might be, Lipset said, that "if we halt
or sharply reduce growth, we con
