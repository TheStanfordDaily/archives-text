## Baseball team drops first game 
### Chris Kamel 
Stanford's varsity baseball
team gambled once too often on
making a comeback and ended
up splitting its two games, beat
ing Santa Clara, 10-4 Monday,
and dropping a 7-4 decision to
the University of Pacific yester
day.
Head coach Mark Marquess
called the Santa Clara contest, "a
game that neither team wanted
to win," as the Cards and Bron
cos accounted for seven errors
between themselves.
Behind 3-0 in the bottom of the
seventh inning, a wild Santa
Clara throw accounted for three
Card runs and led to a 10-run,
two-inning drubbing of the
Broncos.
About the only thing that had
any semblance of order in the
game was the fine pitching of
Card southpaws Rob Irwin and
John Yandle. Yandle (1-0)
picked up the victory, pitching
five innings in relief of Irwin.
The pair did not allow an earned
run.
'Fine job'
"John did a fine job as did
Rob," said Marquess. "He (Yan
dle) was throwing hard and gave
some fine relief as Rob did not
throw with as much velocity as
he could. It might have been too
early to play him (Irwin) again,"
he added, referring to Irwin's
start against USF on Friday.
Offensively, outfielder Mike
Codiroli and catcher Bruce Wal
ters tallied two hits apiece.
"We're just not hitting the ball

like we should," said a con
cerned Marquess. "We are not
putting any pressure on our op
ponents but rather are having it
put on us.
Card troubles
This was the Cards' problem
yesterday against Pacific. The
Tigers jumped out to a 3-0 lead
early in the fourth inning against
pitcher Bruce Fiala.
Stanford battled back on Wal
ter's three-run homer over the
right field fence, with Gary
Pitchford and Tom Guardino on
base.
Pitchford started the rally with
a single and advanced to second
on Guardino's walk. Second
baseman Kevin Triggs kept the
no-out rally alive, when he
reached first base on a throwing
error.
The Cards loaded the bases

when shortstop Dave Perez
walked and outfielder Paul
Zuvella bounced one through
the hole in left field. But Stan
ford's rally failed and all the
baserunners were stranded.
UOP rally
UOP countered in the top of
the sixth when Tom Gonsalves
looped a hit into left field for a
run and another was added with
a sacrifice to move the UOP lead
back up to 5-3.
Perez, who has been hitting
consistently this season, came
back with a booming solo homer
over the 375 marker to bring the
Cards within one, at 5-4.
The doors were closed on the
Cards, however, in the eighth
inning when UOP scored two
runs off reliever Bruce Davis.
The Cards (4-1) travel to Hay
ward State Friday for a 2:30 p.m.
contest and then return to Sun
ken Diamond for a doubleheader

Saturday at noon against Chico
State.

John Yandle. Yandle (1-0)
picked up the victory, pitching
five innings in relief of Irwin.
The pair did not allow an earned
run.
'Fine job'
"John did a fine job as did
Rob," said Marquess. "He (Yan
dle) was throwing hard and gave
some fine relief as Rob did not
throw with as much velocity as
he could. It might have been too
early to play him (Irwin) again,"
he added, referring to Irwin's
start against USF on Friday.
Offensively, outfielder Mike
Codiroli and catcher Bruce Wal
ters tallied two hits apiece.
"We're just not hitting the ball

like we should," said a con
cerned Marquess. "We are not
putting any pressure on our op
ponents but rather are having it
put on us.
Card troubles
This was the Cards' problem
yesterday against Pacific. The
Tigers jumped out to a 3-0 lead
early in the fourth inning against
pitcher Bruce Fiala.
Stanford battled back on Wal
ter's three-run homer over the
right field fence, with Gary
Pitchford and Tom Guardino on
base.
Pitchford started the rally with
a single and advanced to second
on Guardino's walk. Second
baseman Kevin Triggs kept the
no-out rally alive, when he
reached first base on a throwing
error.
The Cards loaded the bases

when shortstop Dave Perez
walked and outfielder Paul
Zuvella bounced one through
the hole in left field. But Stan
ford's rally failed and all the
baserunners were stranded.
UOP rally
UOP countered in the top of
the sixth when Tom Gonsalves
looped a hit into left field for a
run and another was added with
a sacrifice to move the UOP lead
back up to 5-3.
Perez, who has been hitting
consistently this season, came
back with a booming solo homer
over the 375 marker to bring the
Cards within one, at 5-4.
The doors were closed on the
Cards, however, in the eighth
inning when UOP scored two
runs off reliever Bruce Davis.
The Cards (4-1) travel to Hay
ward State Friday for a 2:30 p.m.
contest and then return to Sun
ken Diamond for a doubleheader

Saturday at noon against Chico
State.

Stanford guard Wolfe Perry goes up for a lay-in against Oregon State's Rickey Lee. The Cards,
who lost a 71-61 contest to the Beavers Saturday in Corvallis, Ore., host Oregon State tomorrow
night in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford's varsity baseball
team gambled once too often on
making a comeback and ended
up splitting its two games, beat
ing Santa Clara, 10-4 Monday,
and dropping a 7-4 decision to
the University of Pacific yester
day.
Head coach Mark Marquess
called the Santa Clara contest, "a
game that neither team wanted
to win," as the Cards and Bron
cos accounted for seven errors
between themselves.
Behind 3-0 in the bottom of the
seventh inning, a wild Santa
Clara throw accounted for three
Card runs and led to a 10-run,
two-inning drubbing of the
Broncos.
About the only thing that had
any semblance of order in the
game was the fine pitching of
Card southpaws Rob Irwin and
John Yandle. Yandle (1-0)
picked up the victory, pitching
five innings in relief of Irwin.
The pair did not allow an earned
run.
