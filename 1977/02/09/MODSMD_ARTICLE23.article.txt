# Cards host OSU marksmen
## 
### David Georgette 
Guard George Tucker brings
the ball up the floor, looks inside
to pass, and then flips the ball
out on the wing to Don Smith.
Smith leaps and lets fly a 20-foot
jump shot. Swish! And that is
how the Oregon State Beavers
play basketball.
Oh, sure, Smith isn't the only
Beaver who knows how to shoot
— Rocky Smith, Ricky Lee and
Tucker all can put the roundball
through the hoop.
"Oregon State is a great shoot
ing team," said Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso, "and they have
great quickness both with and
without the ball. Some of their
key shots against us last week
seemed to come from another
area code."
The Beavers will display their
long-distance show tomorrow at
Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m. (KZSU
90.1 FM) when Dißiaso's Cards
host OSU.
Fast break
The Beavers, 13-9 overall and
5-2 in the Pacific-8, have some
thing they'd rather do than pass
the ball around the perimeter
looking for an open shot,
though. At least their coach
Ralph Miller has something —
that's getting rebounds off the
defensive boards and scurrying
down court on a fast break.
The Beavers are hitting over
50 percent from the floor this
year, including a 59 per cent ef
fort against the Cards Saturday.
Rocky Smith leads the Beavers
in scoring with 18.5 points per
game while freshman center

Steve Johnson is second at 14.1
per outing.
Offensive team
In short, OSU plays to win
with its offense. If the Beavers
stop running or can't hit their
perimeter shots, they can't win.
For awhile Saturday they were
not running. Miller said he told
the team during halftime that he
hoped they "took a great deal of
enjoyment in upsetting their
coach, because they did a good
job at it."
If the Cards can cool off the
Beavers tomorrow, Stanford
should be able to end its four
game losing streak. The Cards
haven't won since their last
home game three weeks ago
against Hawaii.

Playing the Beavers back-to
back is not preferred by Dißiaso.
"I don't like it,"he said. "I like
the schedule broken up a little."
Dißiaso said that he doubts the
teams will undertake wholesale
changes in game plans. "Both
teams will try to play the same
way as Saturday while making
small adjustments," he said.
Home court
"I'm hopeful that the home
court edge, plus our improving
health situation, will bring us
some success this week," said
Dißiaso. "I hope our fans come
out to support us. The team is in
a good frame of mind."
In a good frame of mind,
maybe, but not of body. While
guard Wolfe Perry and center Jeff

McHugh did not appear to have
their efforts in Oregon hampered
by earlier ankle injuries, the con
tinued absence of forward Jay
Carter hurt the Cards in the front
line.
"I'm not optimistic about Car
ter returning," said Dißiaso.
"We can't count on being the
team we were in December."
7-3
When Carter left, the Cards
were 7-3. Since then they have
gone 2-7. Carter's injury has also
forced Dißiaso to shuffle his
lineup.
Only the backcourt of Ferry
and Mike Bratz has remained
stable. The pair have carried the
Cards offensively for the most
part. The Stanford backcourt has
shown that on most nights it can
hold its own against the opposi
tion.
The Beavers, tied with Oregon
for second one game behind
Pacific-8 leader IJCLA, can not
afford to let Bratz and Perry both
have good games tomorrow if
OSU wants to remain in conten
tion.
"We're going to have to play a
more consistent game of basket
ball," said Beaver Coach Ralph
Miller Saturday night after
Bratz' offense kept the Cards in
the game until the last four mi
nutes. "1 would credit seven of
our nine losses this year to our
defense."
