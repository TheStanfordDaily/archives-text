# Cards sign top recruit
## 
### 
Pete Lallas, an All-State guard '
from South Eugene High School, •
announced last week that he will'
attend Stanford next year. The;
deadline for signing the Na-.
tional Letter of Intent is next
month.
"Lallas is one of the better
guards this year in the state of*
Oregon," said Oregon State bas-I
ketball coach Ralph Miller. But|
Miller added that OSU did not
recruit Lallas.
"They're probably more
guards, major college basketball •
guards here than anything else,"
said Miller. "No forwards or
postmen. There are at least five,
or six kids with major college po- J
tential and he is one of them. -
This kid is a fine one."
Lallas scored 29 points, in
cluding the game winning bas
ket with 35 seconds left, in the •
prep game Friday night.
