Natural gas supply needs relief
Washington — The latest reports to federal
officials yesterday said three natural gas dis
tributors were in danger of cutting off service
to homes within weeks but were getting fast
emergency gas relief.
Meanwhile, President Jimmy Carter warned
that the energy policy he plans to propose by
April 20 "is going to require substantial sac
rifices on the part of the American people."
Carter, speaking at his first news conference
since taking office, noted that the U.S. has im
ported more than half of its oil during the past
two months and said, "this has got to stop.
"We don't have adequate reserve supplies
stored to meet our needs if we have another
embargo or some other very serious problem in
the future," he said.
Carter repeated he is against nationalizing
the U.S. oil and gas industry but said "I'm
going to try to make sure that all the natural gas
companies and others that produce energy
don't derive unwarranted profits when we cut
back on consumption and when we encourage
production."
Cas shortages are reported easing in a
number of areas as the winter weather returns
to more normal temperatures, probably tem
porarily, in the eastern part of the nation.
But the National Weather Service expects
the relief to blow over this week, bringing a
return of arctic blasts for at least another two or
three weeks.
Drought poses financial losses
Sacramento — Farmers can beat the worst
drought year of the century in California by
intelligent planting techniques, but they're
going to suffer financially, a farm spokesman
said yesterday.

And next year, there will be higher produce
prices in supermarkets nationwide as a result
of what is expected to be at least a 10 per cent
cut in California's produce, said Fred Heringer,
president of the California Farm Bureau Feder
ation.
Heringer said the state and federal an
nouncements of 50 to 75 per cent reductions
this year in irrigation water will lead to a loss of
at least one million acres of irrigated farmland
in the San Joaquin Valley.
Federal officials have warned of power shor
tages this summer from a lack of hydroelectric
power, and Heringer warned that "brownouts"
combined with rationed irrigation water
means "a real disaster — a terrific loss" for the
state's richest-in-the-nation agricultural in
dustry.
Heringer predicted the food prices nation
wide, as a result of California's drought, will
increase faster than inflation in 1978.
A change in planting should bring farmers
through the crisis, Heringer said of the worst
back-to-back drought years this century in
California, even worse than 1931-32.
Spain,U.S.S.R. to start contacts?
Madrid — Spain's post-Franco government
is considering legalizing the long-outlawed
Communist party as well as establishing dip
lomatic relations with the Soviet Union, gov
ernment sources said yesterday. Relations be
tween Madrid and Moscow have been broken
since the Spanish civil war of the 19305.
The sources said that during a lengthy
cabinet session, Premier Adolfo Suarez and his
ministers discussed coupling such an "open
ing to the East" with changes in Spanish law
which could lead to lifting curbs on Spain's
Communist party.
Relations between Madrid and Moscow had

been severed since Gen. Francisco Franco, in
the aftermath of his 1939 civil war triumph,
refused to establish ties with the Soviets be
cause of Russian help to anti-Franco forces
during the civil war. Franco remained Spain's
dictator until his death 14 months ago.
Committee approves nominees
Washington — President Jimmy Garter's
choices for secretaries of the Army and Navy
won the approval yesterday of the Senate
Armed Services Committee without a ripple of
dissent.
In contrast to the tough going that some
nominees for other top posts have endured in
confirmation hearings, the questioning of Clif
ford Alexander and Graham Claytor was gentle
and perfunctory.
Both candidates were approved, 6-0.
Alexander, 43, a Harlem-born lawyer who
served the Johnson administration as a Na
tional Security Council staffer and adviser on
civil rights, thus will become the first black to
serve as secretary of one of the armed forces.
Claytor, 64, comes to the Navy post from the
Southern Railway Co., whose relatively solid
financial condition among U.S. railroads is at
tributed partly to his performance as its presi
dent and chairman.
Agent's death triggers probe
Washington — The wife of an alleged double
agent found electrocuted in a Maryland motel
last April is waging a battle with Army intelli
gence in hopes of finding out why her husband
died, the Washington Post reported yesterday.
The agent. Chief Warrant Officer Ralph
Sigler, was found with electrical wiring wrap
ped around his arms and plugged into a wall

socket of a Jessup, Md., motel last April. The
wire had been cut from a lamp in the room and
stripped of its insulation.
Both Maryland police and Army authorities
concluded that the death of the agent, whose
job allegedly was to sell misleading informa
tion to the Russians, was a suicide. However,
his German-born widow contends, the Post
said, that Army intelligence murdered her
husband because he knew too much about
wrong actions the group had taken.
The Post quoted the widow as saying that her
husband told her in his last telephone call be
fore he died: "just listen to me. Get you a re
spectable lawyer. Sue the U.S. Army. I'm dy
ing. I never lied."
A lawyer for the widow, the Post said, con
siders the murder theory possible but also is
investigating whether the Army drove Sigler to
suicide. The lawyer, Sidney Diamond, also
says he has been told by a former Army intelli
gence officer that "certain foreign powers"
such as the Russians sometimes tortureand kill
persons by wiring them in the way Sigler was
wired, the Post reported.
Guerrillas attack second mission
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Black guerrillas
burned and looted offices of a second Christian
mission, the government said yesterday, while

Salisbury near the Mozambique border. The
government did not say which church oper
ated the mission or when the attack took place.

burned a mission workshop and office.
Three Jesuits and four Dominican nuns were

lined up and shot Sunday night in an attack on
St. Paul's Roman Catholic Mission in the
Musami tribal area 26 miles northeast of Salis
bury and about 150 miles from the Nyashanu
mission.
Outlawed black guerrilla units said agents of
the white government of Prime Minister lan
Smith were be hi nd the attack, the largest group
killing of whites in four years of guerrilla war
aimed at black rule The country has 270,000
whites and more than five million blacks.
