# Carter says U.S. tops in arms, urges Soviet nuclear test cut
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —Declaring that
the United States has nuclear superior
ity over the Soviet Union, President
Jimmy Carter said yesterday it is "very,
very important" that both nations take
fresh initiatives to restrain armaments
while maintaining a balance of power.
At his first White House news con
ference, Carter again expressed con
cern about Soviet treatment of dissi
dents in the U.S.S.R. and argued that
taking Moscoe to task on human rights
issues should not affect the search for
ways to curb the arms race.
Questions about the handling of
arms negotiations with the Soviets

dominated the session, with Carter
disclosing for the first time that he has
asked Moscow to abandon the de
ployment of hard-to-detect mobile
missile launchers used for missiles of
less than intercontinental range.
He also suggested each country give
the other advance notice of any plan
ned testing of intercontinental mis
siles.
Energy program
On domestic topics, Carter said:
—A long-range energy program he has
promised to unveil by April 20 will
"require substantial sacrifices on the
part of the American people" and will

bar any unjustified profits by the oil
and gas industries.
—He hopes to use his veto power spar
ingly, but if Congress made "such
drastic changes" in his draft legisla
tion aimed at stimulating the economy
that "would cause me to doubt its ef
fectiveness or viability, 1 would of
course veto it."
Discussing the relative nuclear
strength of the United States and the
Soviet Union, Carter said, "At the pre
sent time, my judgement is that we
have superior nuclear capability," al
though he later asserted, "I think that
we are roughly equivalent."
Reduction timetable
Arguing that "it is necessary to have
drastic reduction in dependence on
atomic weapons," Carter laid out a
timetable—without target dates—for
an American-Soviet agreement "to
stop the present growth and then to
have substantial reductions" in each
nation's nuclear arsenal.
Asked if his administration's public
statements about human rights in the
Soviet Union might jeopardize rela
tions on other matters. Carter said:
"I think we come out better in deal
ing with the Soviet Union if I am con
sistently and completely dedicated to
the enhancement of human rights, not
only as it deals with the Soviet Union,
but all other countries."
He added that he did not want to
mislead Americans about dealings
with the Soviets or others, continuing:
"We can't expect overnight success.
It requires long, tedious, labored, very
carefully considered progress. I am not
looking for magic answers but my de
termination is very deep."

Questions about the handling of
arms negotiations with the Soviets

dominated the session, with Carter
disclosing for the first time that he has
asked Moscow to abandon the de
ployment of hard-to-detect mobile
missile launchers used for missiles of
less than intercontinental range.
He also suggested each country give
the other advance notice of any plan
ned testing of intercontinental mis
siles.
Energy program
On domestic topics, Carter said:
—A long-range energy program he has
promised to unveil by April 20 will
"require substantial sacrifices on the
part of the American people" and will

bar any unjustified profits by the oil
and gas industries.
—He hopes to use his veto power spar
ingly, but if Congress made "such
drastic changes" in his draft legisla
tion aimed at stimulating the economy
that "would cause me to doubt its ef
fectiveness or viability, 1 would of
course veto it."
Discussing the relative nuclear
strength of the United States and the
Soviet Union, Carter said, "At the pre
sent time, my judgement is that we
have superior nuclear capability," al
though he later asserted, "I think that
we are roughly equivalent."
Reduction timetable
Arguing that "it is necessary to have
drastic reduction in dependence on
atomic weapons," Carter laid out a
timetable—without target dates—for
an American-Soviet agreement "to
stop the present growth and then to
have substantial reductions" in each
nation's nuclear arsenal.
Asked if his administration's public
statements about human rights in the
Soviet Union might jeopardize rela
tions on other matters. Carter said:
"I think we come out better in deal
ing with the Soviet Union if I am con
sistently and completely dedicated to
the enhancement of human rights, not
only as it deals with the Soviet Union,
but all other countries."
He added that he did not want to
mislead Americans about dealings
with the Soviets or others, continuing:
"We can't expect overnight success.
It requires long, tedious, labored, very
carefully considered progress. I am not
looking for magic answers but my de
termination is very deep."
Washington (AP) —Declaring that
the United States has nuclear superior
ity over the Soviet Union, President
Jimmy Carter said yesterday it is "very,
very important" that both nations take
fresh initiatives to restrain armaments
while maintaining a balance of power.
At his first White House news con
ference, Carter again expressed con
cern about Soviet treatment of dissi
dents in the U.S.S.R. and argued that
taking Moscoe to task on human rights
issues should not affect the search for
ways to curb the arms race.
