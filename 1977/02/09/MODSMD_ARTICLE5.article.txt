# Library construction begins

### Laura Kennedy 
Under the protective overhang of
Meyer Library, President Richard
Lyman battled rain and the Hoover
Tower carrillon to dedicate formally
the Cecil H. Green Library yesterday.
Lyman was one of four speakers at
groundbreaking ceremonies for the
$20 million addition to Main Library.
Cecil Green, largest single donor to
the library (with a $6 million pledge),
spoke for himself and his wife Ida, say
ing, "We're grateful that Ida and I had
the wherewithal to make this dona
tion. We feel downright fortunate."
Green is a cofounder of Texas In
struments, Inc.
David Weber, director of university
libraries and Peter Bing, chairman of
the Board of Trustees, also spoke.
For the benefit of photographers, the
four speakers plunged gold-colored
shovels into the "ground"—a box fil
led with dirt.
Weber said construction of the addi
tion would take two years. Construc
tion should start tomorrow, according
to Roger Cairns, Planning Office senior
planner.
No decision has been reached on
how the three story building's top
floor will be used, said Cairns.
Weber said the University has rec
ognized the need for an addition to
Main Library since 1964. "For a good
many years, it has been inadequate for
the needs of faculty and students."
A 1967 plan for an addition twice
the size of the current one was scrap
ped in 1973 for lack of funds.
In his speech, Bing listed some of the

donors to the Cecil H. Green Library.
These included the kresge Founda
tion, Gulf Oil, Walter Haas (former
chairman of the board of Levi-Strauss),
Mr. and Mrs. Peter Haas, Madeleine
Haas Russell, the McDermott family
and PACCAR (formerly Pacific Car and
Foundry Company).
Bing also said an anonymous $5
million donation had been made.
Donations to the library have met
more than $15 million of the $20 mill
ion cost.
Weber praised the design of the
building, saying, "The architect has
produced an uncommonly inviting
design."
Gyo Obata, of the architectural firm
of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum,
Inc., was present for the ceremonies, as

were project architect Jean McArthur
and project designer Bill Valentine.
The building has been designed
with energy conservation in mind.
Lights and ventilation systems over
areas not in use can be switched off.
Shelves are clustered in the building's
core so reading areas can take advan
tage of natural light.
"Great effort has been expended so
that readers' collections will be readily
accessible," said Weber.
The library addition will include
many student carrels and faculty of
fices since Main Library has few.
Renovations are planned for Main
Library, built in 15)19, but will not be
started until the addition has been
completed, Cairns said.

the Board of Trustees, also spoke.
For the benefit of photographers, the
four speakers plunged gold-colored
shovels into the "ground"—a box fil
led with dirt.
Weber said construction of the addi
tion would take two years. Construc
tion should start tomorrow, according
to Roger Cairns, Planning Office senior
planner.
No decision has been reached on
how the three story building's top
floor will be used, said Cairns.
Weber said the University has rec
ognized the need for an addition to
Main Library since 1964. "For a good
many years, it has been inadequate for
the needs of faculty and students."
A 1967 plan for an addition twice
the size of the current one was scrap
ped in 1973 for lack of funds.
In his speech, Bing listed some of the

donors to the Cecil H. Green Library.
These included the kresge Founda
tion, Gulf Oil, Walter Haas (former
chairman of the board of Levi-Strauss),
Mr. and Mrs. Peter Haas, Madeleine
Haas Russell, the McDermott family
and PACCAR (formerly Pacific Car and
Foundry Company).
Bing also said an anonymous $5
million donation had been made.
Donations to the library have met
more than $15 million of the $20 mill
ion cost.
Weber praised the design of the
building, saying, "The architect has
produced an uncommonly inviting
design."
Gyo Obata, of the architectural firm
of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum,
Inc., was present for the ceremonies, as

were project architect Jean McArthur
and project designer Bill Valentine.
The building has been designed
with energy conservation in mind.
Lights and ventilation systems over
areas not in use can be switched off.
Shelves are clustered in the building's
core so reading areas can take advan
tage of natural light.
"Great effort has been expended so
that readers' collections will be readily
accessible," said Weber.
The library addition will include
many student carrels and faculty of
fices since Main Library has few.
Renovations are planned for Main
Library, built in 15)19, but will not be
started until the addition has been
completed, Cairns said.
Under the protective overhang of
Meyer Library, President Richard
Lyman battled rain and the Hoover
Tower carrillon to dedicate formally
the Cecil H. Green Library yesterday.
Lyman was one of four speakers at
groundbreaking ceremonies for the
$20 million addition to Main Library.
Cecil Green, largest single donor to
the library (with a $6 million pledge),
spoke for himself and his wife Ida, say
ing, "We're grateful that Ida and I had
the wherewithal to make this dona
tion. We feel downright fortunate."
Green is a cofounder of Texas In
struments, Inc.
