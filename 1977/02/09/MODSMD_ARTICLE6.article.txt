The ASSU Senate will "thrust ahead" with efforts to establish an on-campus
massage parlor, according to ASSU Sen. Jon Barth.
The senate voted 7-4 Monday to pass Barth's "Come in My Parlor" resolution.
The measure will set up a committee of at least four students to investigate the
possibility of having an on-campus parlor this fall.
Barth said later he seriously wants to pursue this project. "I'd at least like to see
why we can't have it,"he said. "I don't think the administration has any power in
this matter."
Barth also said that the proposal he has introduced could include groups
which might already exist here. In response to a letter which appeared in
yesterday's Daily, Barth said that he has been invited to Uammarskjold House for
"dinner and a massage" later this week.
He also said that he will try to keep the proposal "as legal as possible" and that
the service will be "strictly for Stanford students and faculty â€” especially
faculty."
Other senators were not amused at the resolution to establish an on-campus
massage parlor. Sen. Steve Wurzburg said that "it doesn't seem out of line with
other senate actions which have been taken this year."
Sen. Brad Krevoy remarked that "the issue of the massage parlor comes down
to this: another Hammer and Coffin attempt to make a joke out of student
government."
The senate also voted to support recommendations made by the Council of
Presidents (COP) Task Force for improving undergraduate education here.
One of the more controversial recommendations was to offer financial awards
for excellent teaching. Although senators favored offering rewards to outstand
ing professors, they disagreed about the amount and source of the rewards.
Other changes recommended by the COP Task Force included initiating a
more thorough system for evaluating courses and acquiring more detailed ap
praisals of professorial candidates.
