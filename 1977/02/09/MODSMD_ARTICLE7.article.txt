# Job hunters cause humanities decline

Why have students shifted from
humanities and social science majors
to science majors in the last eight
years?
Consensus among deans, depart
ment chairmen and other faculty is
that students are now seeking majors
that lead to jobs.
Students in the late '60s were "terri
bly concerned about societal prob
lems," said Halsey Hoyden, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
Now, students are "preparing for
jobs," Assoc. English Prof. Nancy
Packer said.
The History Department has experi
enced the sharpest decline in under
graduate majors. Registrar's Office fi
gures show 631 history majors in 1966
and only 238 this year, a drop of 64 per
cent.
Peter Stansky, chairman of the His
tory Department, cited elimination of

the Western Civilization requirement
as a possible explanation of the trend.
Even so, Stansky said, Stanford is "do
ing slightly better than other depart
ments over the country."
Humanities departments have
shown a similar decline. Since 1968,
the number of philosophy majors has
gone down 49 per cent and the number
of English majors has declined by
more than one third.
Meanwhile, science majors have be
come ever more popular. Since 1968,
the Biology Department has experi
enced a 51 per cent increase in the
number of majors and the Chemistry
Department a 102 per cent increase.
Largest increases, however, are in
the School of Engineering. Since 1968,
majors are up 93 per cent in mechani
cal engineering, 133 per cent in in
dustrial engineering, 142 per cent in
electrical engineering and 210 percent
in chemical engineering.
