## Opinions National Service: the new slavery 
### 
Bill Evers

In recent weeks, a coalition of
militarists and welfare-state liberals
has been trying to bring back the draft.
The militarists like Sen. John Stennis
(D-Miss.) and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.)
have always favored the draft both as a
way of building a large standing army
while only paying out what are liter
ally slave wages and as a way in \yhich
military values could be instilled in
the civilian population.
Harold Brown, the new defense sec
retary, has said he hopes to reduce the
budget costs of manpower as a way of
meeting Carter's now deferred pledge
to cut defense spending. One way to do
this would be to tax young men by
forcing them to work and paying them
less than competitive wages.
Similarly, welfare statists like HEW
Secretary Joseph Califano both oppose
paying soldiers prevailing market
wages (rather than assigning these
funds to programs managed by HEW
officials) and contend that in frag
mented modern society only a draft
(rather than voluntary groups like fam
ily and church) can instill morals,
manners and allegiance to the gov
ernment in new generations.
Moreover, in addition to revival of
the military draft, some commentators
and politicians like California Gov.
Jerry Brown are proposing extension
of the conscription principle in the
form of National Service — a compul
sory youth labor program.
A major ideological source of oppos
ition to a volunteer military is a politi
cal tradition going back to
Machiavelli. Those adhering to this
Machiavellian tradition distrust a vol
unteer military because they distrust
cash payments, professionalism and
the functional division of labor, par
ticularly with regard to anything con
nected with political life.
Conscription proponents of the
Machiavellian tradition see the best
society as the heavily politicized re
gimes of ancient Greek city-states or of
the Roman republic. Hence, for them,
vigorous citizen participation in war

and in government-approved civic ac
tion is more important than personal
freedom and individual rights.
The modern-day advocates of Na
tional Service generally take up and
extend this Machiavellian attitude by
praising National Service as a sacrifice
of individuals to the State.
In addition, current proponents of
National Service apparently believe
that they have discovered a budgetar
ily cheap way to make a dent in the
youth unemployment problem.
In fact, however, the costs of a univ
ersal program would be astronomical,
and the forced labor of young men and
women in unproductive projects
would work a cure on unemployment
only on paper while making the soci
ety poorer in liberty and in material
wealth than it would be if young
people were truly allowed to work on
their own.
Another approach taken by advo
cates of National Service is to proclaim
that the work program is really an edu
cational endeavor. This tack was taken
by LBJ's Defense Secretary Robert
McNamara in his 1966 speech in
Montreal — a speech from which the
contemporary revival of interest in Na
tional Service dates.
Yet it is certainly disheartening to
hear talk of more compulsory educa
tion in a time when educationalists
like Paul Goodman, Ivan Illich, and
John Holt have called into question the
compatibility of genuine education
with compulsory attendence.
Likewise, it should be clear that
charitable acts and service are incom
patible with coercion. Sen. Mark Hat
field (R-Ore.) objects to the use of the
word "service" in National Service be
cause he recognizes that there is a con
tradiction in the notion of unwilling
service.
Hatfield says, "This utilization of
the word 'service' is contradictory to
any common use or experience of
service-oriented activity. Service by its
very nature is a voluntary expression
free of external coercion."

Here Hatfield is properly stressing
the fatal flaw in National Service — its
dependence on involuntary servitude.
Coercion and temporary enslavement
of youth dehumanizes them by making
them tools of government bureaucrats.
Through habituation to conscription,
we would change in character from a
free people to a servile one.
As sociologist Richard Flacks, a
leader in the early New Left, once
wrote, "The goal of democrats in the
coming period ought to be to reduce
rather than enhance areas of compul
sion in American life . . . The notion
that (National Service) should be com
pulsory or tied to conscription is liter
ally totalitarian." Let us therefore
energetically resist any revival of the
conscription principle in American
life.
