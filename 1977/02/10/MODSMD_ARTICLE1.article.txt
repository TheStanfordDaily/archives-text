# University considers lifting sorority ban
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes George Anders 
Banned since 1944, sororities may
be coming back.
There is a "very high likelihood" the
University will ask the Board of Trus
tees in April to rescind its 33-year-old
ban on sororities here, according to
Jarnes Lyons, dean of student affairs.
Currently, there are 13 fraternities
here, but no sororities. Lyons said ad
ministrators believe this may violate a
federal law against sex discrimination,
Title IX of the Education Amendments
of 1972.
"It's a matter of honor," Lyons said,
noting that the University must state it
is in compliance with Title IX to re
ceive Department of Health, Education
and Welfare funds.
Fraternities offer males here the
chance to choose their housemates
through "subjective selection," which
women cannot do, Lyons said.
Norm Robinson, acting associate
dean of student affairs, also expressed
concern in a lan. 31 memothat offering
a subjective selectivity option only to
males violates Title IX. His memo was
addressed to the Committee on Ser
vices to Students Subcommittee on
Residences (COSS/R).
Force unnecessary
If the trustees allow sororities on
campus, "I don't think that there'd be
any requirement that there be any spe
cial number of sororities," Iris Brest,
associate staff legal counsel said. "If it
turns out there's no demand, no con
sideration of law would require forc
ing sororities on students," she said.
The University would probably con
sider adding sororities even without
Title IX, Brest said.
"I'd put less stress on the law and
more on the matter of equity," Lyons
said. "Some students enjoy privileges
that other students want and don't
have. We have to repair that situation."
The University could also conform
to Title IX by stripping fraternities of
their subjective selectivity, Lyons said,

but he said he doubted anyone would
give that option serious consideration.
Title IX applies only to education
programs receiving federal funds.
Thus, fraternities at most schools are
not affected by the act, Lyons said.
However, fraternities here are on
University-owned land, and the Uni
versity received federal funds, thus
making Title IX applicable here, he
explained.
Vote postponed
At a meeting of the entire committee
yesterday, COSS considered the Title
IX question, but postponed a vote on
sororities until next week's meeting.
At yesterday's meeting, Lyons
suggested that eliminating fraternities
may alienate alumni and thus result in
a decline in donations.

"There's a fair collection of opinion
that it is never good to bruise a certain
part of your family — the alumni body
— unnecessarily. This is a group that
has invested in fraternities, through
newsletters, activities and so on,"
Lyons said.
Lyons also pointed out that the Uni
versity has in the past assured alumni
that the fraternity system will be re
tained.
Committee member Tim Ferguson,
former Inter-Fraternity Council rush
chairman, said subjective selectivity
was an "absolute cornerstone" of the
fraternity system.
Sororities different
In addition, "There are good reasons
to expect that sororities here would be
different from sororities elsewhere,

since I think it's evident that frater
nities here are different," he said. "On
many campuses, they exist as a world
apart socially, and 1 don't think that's
true here."
He said there is low minority par
ticipation in fraternities, but added, "1
don't think that would be a problem in
a sorority system starting from
scratch."
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference last November, President
Richard Lyman indicated that if
sororities returned here new houses
would probably be built for them.
The trustees banned sororities in
1944 after a special committee re
ported that sororities had a detrimen
tal monopoly on the social life of
female students.


Band in sight?
Prospective Dollies practice one of the required
routines in the first of three workshops leading up to
the final selection on Feb. 28. This year, about 70
women signed up for the workshops. They will be

judged by 70 different representatives of various
campus organizations, who will narrow the field to 10
finalists. The finalists are then interviewed by officers
of the band who pick the five new dollies.
