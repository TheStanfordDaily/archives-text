'Nameplate'
I felt a comment was in order on the
announcement of the new Daily
"nameplate" in your "Briefly" column
(Daily, Feb. 8). You may be interested to
know that the big letters spelling The
Stanford Daily are not a "nameplate,"
("a plate or plaque bearing ... a name,
as that of the owner . . . ") but rather
are a masthead. 1 believe you might
find a book such as Webster's Dictio
nary of great utility in making The
Stanford Daily "innovativeand bold."

(Editor's note: "Masthead" as defined
in the second edition of Webster's New
International Unabridged Dictionary
is "the matter printed in every issue of
a newspaper or journal, stating the ti
tle, ownership, and management, sub
scription and advertising rates, etc."
You will find the masthead on page
two of the Daily. As for the term
"nameplate," Stanford Communica
tion Prof. William Rivers in The Mass
Media describes it as a synonym for
"flag-front-page title of a newspaper.")
Career and family
Abby Roeder's notion that people
must choose between the rewards of
careers and the joys of child rearing
(Daily, Feb. 4) seems curiously anac
hronistic to me. As both a full-time
faculty member and a parent who

equally shares household obligations,
I am astonished and somewhat
amused to be told that the choice I have
made is somehow unavailable. My
children would, 1 think, be equally
perplexed to be told that they were suf
fering from the fact that two parents,
rather than one, took responsibility for

their upbringing.
Should we conclude that
Roeder's report of the impossibility of
combining a career with a family has
been exaggerated?
