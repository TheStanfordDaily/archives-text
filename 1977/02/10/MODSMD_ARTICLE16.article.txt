# Jazz Band swings on campus
## 
### 
As the sun peaks high in the western sky and high noon hits
the hawkers and walkers in White Plaza, 20 young Stanford
men assemble their instruments and begin to play amidst
lunching students, dogs, birds and faculty on the steps of
Tresidder Union.
As the music gets louder and the beat gets stronger, Adidas
clad feet start tapping, drumming fingers lose control, heads
start nodding and everybody grins.
Eloquent words of praise gush from the captivated crowd:
"They're GREAT!" "Fantastic!" "Unbelievable, man!" The
compliments flow ad nauseum.

It gets boring asking people what they think of the Stanford
Studio Jazz Band. I must have asked a hundred people, aged
eight to 80, what they think of the group, and the replies were,
as they always are, a variation on a theme: "they're great!"
A 'big band*
Consisting of five saxophone players (who between them
play soprano, alto, tenor and baritone sax, as well as clarinet
and flute), five trombonists, five guys on trumpet and a rhythm
section (with bass, drums, vibes, guitar and piano), the Jazz
Band is a "big band" that plays '40s tunes of band leaders like
Count Basie and Woody Herman as well as contemporary
music like that of Chicago and Maynard Ferguson. Their ver
satility could be one reason for their popularity; sophomore
bass trombone player Kevin Cavanaugh offers another.
"We're loud," says Kevin. "Tresidder'sagood place to play.
When it's a nice day, people are gonna hang around. There's
something about a big band that's very.very attractive. We're
playing music that's lively," he says. "There are a lot of people
at Stanford that are closet jazz freaks."
Conductor Pat Spurling could be another reason for the
band's success. "Fat is the one that has made the band what it
is. He's the one that's done the work, gotten the charts (jazz
lingo for sheet music), figured out the concerts; he's the
motivating force behind the band," says Kevin.
"Pat's had a great deal of experience; he knows his stuff. He's
a performer; he's still very much in touch with what's happen
ing. He's very much at home in many different styles," con
tinues Kevin.
A student of the classics and a lover of jazz, the 24-year-old
Spurling, a trombonist, came to Stanford in 1975 with a B.A. in
music from Humboldt State University, high in the timbered
and rustic realm of northern Northern California.
Jazz T.A.
He is a half-time T.A. with the Jazz Band, working under the
direction of music professor and Marching Band director Art
Barnes. For the most part, however, Spurling has had complete
control of the group for the past two years. Previously, the
group was not exactly what one would call active.
"The band has been in existence for a long time," says Pat,
"but apparently the first time anyone was aware it existed was
when I started (working with it) last year," when the group

played for frats, dorms, and various clubs. The year before last,
according to Pat, the band only played once.
"It's completely up to the T. A. what happens to the group,"
says Pat, who keeps the guys busy with two one-hour rehear
sals each week. "One year the T. A. might not know that much
about jazz." The group is "limited by the grad students that
apply to the (T.A.J program," he says.
While acknowledging the importance of his position as the
Jazz Band T. A., Spurling realizes that the group is only as good
as its weakest member. Fortunately, that hasn't caused him too
much worry. "We've been really lucky," he says. "We've got
good players. Many of them have considerable experience from
high school."
'Experience'
Although "high school" experience may not sound too
"considerable," consider the fact that California's Corona del
Mar High, attended by Kevin and sophomore drummer Jeff
Fraass, had the number two-rated high school jazz band in the
country their junior year (though they add modestly that rat
ings are subjective and "don't mean anything"). Consider also
the fact that freshman Marty Rapkin. a featured sax player in
the group, has played professionally in the "Borscht Belt" of
New York's Catskill Mountains since he was 15. And consider,
too, that lead trombone player SÂ»ndy Hughes, another sopho
more, has toured Europe with the Blue Saints, a young group

with whom he has also cut an album.
For these guys, high school wasn't that long ago. As a matter
of fact, about three-fourths of the group consists of freshmen
and sophomores. Yet although many of them have experience
that transcends their years, most members cite the easy-going
atmosphere and not the group's professionalism as the major
reason they play in the Jazz Band.
'No tension'
"It's loose," says Sandy. "There's no tension. It's not going
to be the top band inCaliforniafor a long time," he adds with a
big smile, "but we enjoy playing more than other school bands.
We're not concerned with whether or not we're better than
somebody else. We're not competition-oriented."
"We know we're the best big band on campus," says Kevin,
neglecting to add that they're the only big band on campus.
So, if you're cruising in White Plaza tomorrow about noon,
chances are you'll hear Stanford's best (and only) Big Band
play. And Saturday night at 8 in Dinkelspiel, the band will
perform with an ensemble from U.C. Berkeley, free. (The con
cert will, incidentally, be replayed on KZSU Sunday night at 9).
If you're like the rest of the eloquent masses who think the Jazz
Band is "great," you won't want to miss these opportunities to
hear them. And maybe you'll be able to come up with some
better adjectives while you're listening.
