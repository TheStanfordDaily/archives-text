### Frances Draper 
A group of students is seeking the
release of Soviet political prisoner
Sergei Kovalev and his appointment to
an ASSU guest professorship.
Kovalev, 47, is a professor of
neurobiology who taught at the Uni
versity of Moscow and who has more
than 60 publications to his credit, ac
cording to Julia Brown, press officer of
the newly-founded Committee to Free
Sergei Kovalev.
Kovalev, who founded an Amnesty
International group in Moscow,
worked to further human rights in the
Soviet Union, said Brown. Two years
ago he and Soviet physicist Andrei
Sakharov appealed for a general am
nesty for prisoners of conscience
throughout the world, Brown said.
In December 1975, Kovalev was ar
rested for his activities, according to
Brown. A year later, he was charged
with "anti-Soviet agitation and prop
aganda," she said. He is currently serv
ing a seven-year hard labor sentence.
The committee hopes to convince

the Biology Department to invite
Kovalev to teach here, with his salary
to be paid by a student body fee as
sessment, according to Brown.
The committee obtained its informa
tion on Kovalev from Amnesty Inter
national, said Brown. She noted that
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy, chair
man of the Program in Human Biology,
and Adjunct Biology Prof. Donald Per
kel have verified Kovalev's academic
credibility.
Perkel said both he and Kennedy be
lieve that Kovalev's publications have
contributed significantly to the field of
neurobiology and that Kovalev is quite
well-known and respected.
"Exchange of scientists between
countries is quite valuable," said Per
kel. "1 sympathize with the committee
and their methods of action."
The committee presented its case to
the Undergraduate Committee of the
Biology Department, which agreed to
recommend that Kovalev be invited to
teach in the department. The under-

graduate committee will present its re
commendations to a meeting of the
Biology Department faculty Feb. 14.
If the faculty approves, the depart
ment would issue an invitation to
Kovalev, said Brown. This would
bring some beneficial publicity to his
case, she commented.
She said the committee believes a
guest professorship for Kovalev would
directly enhance the academic and
cultural opportunities here. In addi
tion to teaching courses in his
academic field, said Brown, Kovalev
could offer a course on the struggle for
civil liberties in the Soviet Union
based on his personal experiences.
As soon as an appointment is ap
proved for Kovalev. the University
will support an application for a visa
through Bechtel International Center,
said Susan Horst, assistant to the vice
provost for faculty affairs.
The committee was also voted $50
for operating funds by the ASSU Se
nate Monday night.

and their methods of action."
The committee presented its case to
the Undergraduate Committee of the
Biology Department, which agreed to
recommend that Kovalev be invited to
teach in the department. The under-

graduate committee will present its re
commendations to a meeting of the
Biology Department faculty Feb. 14.
If the faculty approves, the depart
ment would issue an invitation to
Kovalev, said Brown. This would
bring some beneficial publicity to his
case, she commented.
She said the committee believes a
guest professorship for Kovalev would
directly enhance the academic and
cultural opportunities here. In addi
tion to teaching courses in his
academic field, said Brown, Kovalev
could offer a course on the struggle for
civil liberties in the Soviet Union
based on his personal experiences.
As soon as an appointment is ap
proved for Kovalev. the University
will support an application for a visa
through Bechtel International Center,
said Susan Horst, assistant to the vice
provost for faculty affairs.
The committee was also voted $50
for operating funds by the ASSU Se
nate Monday night.
A group of students is seeking the
release of Soviet political prisoner
Sergei Kovalev and his appointment to
an ASSU guest professorship.
Kovalev, 47, is a professor of
neurobiology who taught at the Uni
versity of Moscow and who has more
than 60 publications to his credit, ac
cording to Julia Brown, press officer of
the newly-founded Committee to Free
Sergei Kovalev.
Kovalev, who founded an Amnesty
International group in Moscow,
worked to further human rights in the
Soviet Union, said Brown. Two years
ago he and Soviet physicist Andrei
Sakharov appealed for a general am
nesty for prisoners of conscience
throughout the world, Brown said.
In December 1975, Kovalev was ar
rested for his activities, according to
Brown. A year later, he was charged
with "anti-Soviet agitation and prop
aganda," she said. He is currently serv
ing a seven-year hard labor sentence.
The committee hopes to convince

the Biology Department to invite
Kovalev to teach here, with his salary
to be paid by a student body fee as
sessment, according to Brown.
The committee obtained its informa
tion on Kovalev from Amnesty Inter
national, said Brown. She noted that
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy, chair
man of the Program in Human Biology,
and Adjunct Biology Prof. Donald Per
kel have verified Kovalev's academic
credibility.
Perkel said both he and Kennedy be
lieve that Kovalev's publications have
contributed significantly to the field of
neurobiology and that Kovalev is quite
well-known and respected.
"Exchange of scientists between
countries is quite valuable," said Per
kel. "1 sympathize with the committee
and their methods of action."
