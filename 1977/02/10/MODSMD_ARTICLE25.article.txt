Warnke criticized by former boss
Washington — Paul Warnke's former boss at
the Pentagon said yesterday the Senate should
not approve his nomination as chief U.S.
negotiator in arms limitation talks with the
Soviet Union.
Former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Nitze
said Warnke's views on arms control have been
inconsistent. He also said Warnke made state
ments Tuesday that "were so different from the
sense of his remarks from 1969 to 1976 that I'm
disturbed."
Nitze appeared before the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, where Warnke testified Tues
day, and where his nomination as arms
negotiator and head of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency is expected to win ap
proval.
Nitze served as deputy defense secretary dur
ing the Johnson administration, while Warnke
was an assistant secretary.
He challenged Warnke's suggestion, in an arti
cle in Foreign Policy last spring, that the United
States declare a six-month moratorium on new
weapons development and called on the Soviet
Union for reciprocal restraint.
President Jimmy Carter nominated Warnke to
direct the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency and to chair the U.S. delegation to
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet
Union.
East Bay to begin water rationing
Oakland — Showers each night, clean shirts
every day and lush green lawns may become
luxurious memories for more than a million
northern Californians who awoke yesterday to
strict water rationing orders.
Directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility Dis
trict, which serves 1.1 million persons across the
bay from San Francisco, imposed the new restric

tions because a two-year drought has severely
reduced reservoir levels.
Just 10 days earlier, 169,000 Marin County re
sidents were ordered to cut water use in half. San
Francisco has declared a "water emergency" but
has not yet enforced any restrictions.
The East Hay rationing, covering Oakland and
surrounding communities in Alameda and Con
tra Costa counties, came with warnings that
chronic abusers of the restrictions would find
their water supply monitored and the valve
turned off when the limit was reached.
Each person will be limited to 60 gallons a day
with a maximum of 280 gallons per family, re
gardless of size.
Studies favor agency hiring rules
Washington — The entire process of tilling
federal regulatory jobs should be overhauled be
cause the current system has produced unre
markable and sometimes biased regulators, new
Senate studies conclude.
In calling for strict new conflict-of-interest
rules and for a review of all agencies by the Carter
administration, the two reports by the Senate
Government Operations Committee give con
gressional support to President Carter's an
nounced intentions to reform the federal reg
ulators.
The reports, endorsed by the committee, were
released yesterday. Carter has not nominated
anyone to the 11 openings on regulatory agen
cies.
"Too often regulatory appointments are not the
best suited individuals. Too often the over-all
composition rf the commissions have been heav
ily weighted in the direction of a singleapproach
or a point of view," said the first report, which
deals with regulatory appointments.

Spain opens relations with U.S.S.R.
Madrid — Spain reestablished diplomatic re
lations with the Soviet Union yesterday, ending a
nearly 40-year rift that began when Francisco
Franco's rightists won the Spanish civil war.
A few hours after the announcements in Mad
rid and Moscow, King Juan Carlos began a mis
sion to heal another rift of the Franco years by
flying to Rome for a meeting with Pope Paul VI —
the first visit by a Spanish ruler to a Roman
Catholic pontiff since 1923.
Reestablishment of the Soviet diplomatic tie
came just a day after the Spanish government
decreed a law that could result in legalization of
theCommunist party. Itallows the supreme court
to decide the legal status of political parties in
stead of the cabinet.
Spain also renewed relations yesterday with
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the last two coun
tries in the Soviet bloc without diplomatic ties to
Spain.
S. African students protest exams
Johannesburg — Black Students in the sprawl
ing Soweto ghetto built bonfires of school books
and sang "We Shall Overcome" in demonstra
tions yesterday against taking final examinations
put off since last year.
Classes were disrupted for the day, but au
thorities ordered all students to be in their clas
srooms between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. today under a
curfew threatening tough action against youths
found on the streets during school hours.
The order followed demonstrations by some
6000 students in the strictly segregated city of
more than one million blacks located 10 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.
Riot police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of
an estimated 4000 students at a high school in the
Meadowlands district.
The examinations were postponed last year by

antigovernment rioting in Soweto that later
spread to other black townships throughout the
country. Some 500 blacks were reported killed in
the riots.
Student militants oppose the exams because
release of arrested student leaders, reforms in
black education and other demands made during
last year's unrest have not been met.

1.4-million-member union.
The AP figures, compiled from reports to the
union's district offices, gave Mcßride 296,053
and Sadlowski 193,192 at 3593 of the union's

Warnke criticized by former boss
Washington — Paul Warnke's former boss at
the Pentagon said yesterday the Senate should
not approve his nomination as chief U.S.
negotiator in arms limitation talks with the
Soviet Union.
Former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Nitze
said Warnke's views on arms control have been
inconsistent. He also said Warnke made state
ments Tuesday that "were so different from the
sense of his remarks from 1969 to 1976 that I'm
disturbed."
Nitze appeared before the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, where Warnke testified Tues
day, and where his nomination as arms
negotiator and head of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency is expected to win ap
proval.
Nitze served as deputy defense secretary dur
ing the Johnson administration, while Warnke
was an assistant secretary.
He challenged Warnke's suggestion, in an arti
cle in Foreign Policy last spring, that the United
States declare a six-month moratorium on new
weapons development and called on the Soviet
Union for reciprocal restraint.
President Jimmy Carter nominated Warnke to
direct the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency and to chair the U.S. delegation to
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet
Union.
East Bay to begin water rationing
Oakland — Showers each night, clean shirts
every day and lush green lawns may become
luxurious memories for more than a million
northern Californians who awoke yesterday to
strict water rationing orders.
Directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility Dis
trict, which serves 1.1 million persons across the
bay from San Francisco, imposed the new restric

tions because a two-year drought has severely
reduced reservoir levels.
Just 10 days earlier, 169,000 Marin County re
sidents were ordered to cut water use in half. San
Francisco has declared a "water emergency" but
has not yet enforced any restrictions.
The East Hay rationing, covering Oakland and
surrounding communities in Alameda and Con
tra Costa counties, came with warnings that
chronic abusers of the restrictions would find
their water supply monitored and the valve
turned off when the limit was reached.
Each person will be limited to 60 gallons a day
with a maximum of 280 gallons per family, re
gardless of size.
Studies favor agency hiring rules
Washington — The entire process of tilling
federal regulatory jobs should be overhauled be
cause the current system has produced unre
markable and sometimes biased regulators, new
Senate studies conclude.
In calling for strict new conflict-of-interest
rules and for a review of all agencies by the Carter
administration, the two reports by the Senate
Government Operations Committee give con
gressional support to President Carter's an
nounced intentions to reform the federal reg
ulators.
The reports, endorsed by the committee, were
released yesterday. Carter has not nominated
anyone to the 11 openings on regulatory agen
cies.
"Too often regulatory appointments are not the
best suited individuals. Too often the over-all
composition rf the commissions have been heav
ily weighted in the direction of a singleapproach
or a point of view," said the first report, which
deals with regulatory appointments.

Spain opens relations with U.S.S.R.
Madrid — Spain reestablished diplomatic re
lations with the Soviet Union yesterday, ending a
nearly 40-year rift that began when Francisco
Franco's rightists won the Spanish civil war.
A few hours after the announcements in Mad
rid and Moscow, King Juan Carlos began a mis
sion to heal another rift of the Franco years by
flying to Rome for a meeting with Pope Paul VI —
the first visit by a Spanish ruler to a Roman
Catholic pontiff since 1923.
Reestablishment of the Soviet diplomatic tie
came just a day after the Spanish government
decreed a law that could result in legalization of
theCommunist party. Itallows the supreme court
to decide the legal status of political parties in
stead of the cabinet.
Spain also renewed relations yesterday with
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the last two coun
tries in the Soviet bloc without diplomatic ties to
Spain.
S. African students protest exams
Johannesburg — Black Students in the sprawl
ing Soweto ghetto built bonfires of school books
and sang "We Shall Overcome" in demonstra

put off since last year.
Classes were disrupted for the day, but au
thorities ordered all students to be in their clas
srooms between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. today under a
curfew threatening tough action against youths
found on the streets during school hours.
The order followed demonstrations by some
6000 students in the strictly segregated city of
more than one million blacks located 10 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.
Riot police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of
an estimated 4000 students at a high school in the
Meadowlands district.
The examinations were postponed last year by

antigovernment rioting in Soweto that later
spread to other black townships throughout the
country. Some 500 blacks were reported killed in
the riots.
Student militants oppose the exams because
release of arrested student leaders, reforms in
black education and other demands made during
last year's unrest have not been met.

Warnke criticized by former boss
Washington — Paul Warnke's former boss at
the Pentagon said yesterday the Senate should
not approve his nomination as chief U.S.
negotiator in arms limitation talks with the
Soviet Union.
Former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Nitze
said Warnke's views on arms control have been
inconsistent. He also said Warnke made state
ments Tuesday that "were so different from the
sense of his remarks from 1969 to 1976 that I'm
disturbed."
Nitze appeared before the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, where Warnke testified Tues
day, and where his nomination as arms
negotiator and head of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency is expected to win ap
proval.
Nitze served as deputy defense secretary dur
ing the Johnson administration, while Warnke
was an assistant secretary.
He challenged Warnke's suggestion, in an arti
cle in Foreign Policy last spring, that the United
States declare a six-month moratorium on new
weapons development and called on the Soviet
Union for reciprocal restraint.
President Jimmy Carter nominated Warnke to
direct the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency and to chair the U.S. delegation to
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet
Union.
East Bay to begin water rationing
Oakland — Showers each night, clean shirts
every day and lush green lawns may become
luxurious memories for more than a million
northern Californians who awoke yesterday to
strict water rationing orders.
Directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility Dis
trict, which serves 1.1 million persons across the
bay from San Francisco, imposed the new restric

tions because a two-year drought has severely
reduced reservoir levels.
Just 10 days earlier, 169,000 Marin County re
sidents were ordered to cut water use in half. San
Francisco has declared a "water emergency" but
has not yet enforced any restrictions.
The East Hay rationing, covering Oakland and
surrounding communities in Alameda and Con
tra Costa counties, came with warnings that
chronic abusers of the restrictions would find
their water supply monitored and the valve
turned off when the limit was reached.
Each person will be limited to 60 gallons a day
with a maximum of 280 gallons per family, re
gardless of size.
Studies favor agency hiring rules
Washington — The entire process of tilling
federal regulatory jobs should be overhauled be
cause the current system has produced unre
markable and sometimes biased regulators, new
Senate studies conclude.
In calling for strict new conflict-of-interest
rules and for a review of all agencies by the Carter
administration, the two reports by the Senate
Government Operations Committee give con
gressional support to President Carter's an
nounced intentions to reform the federal reg
ulators.
The reports, endorsed by the committee, were
released yesterday. Carter has not nominated
anyone to the 11 openings on regulatory agen
cies.
"Too often regulatory appointments are not the
best suited individuals. Too often the over-all
composition rf the commissions have been heav
ily weighted in the direction of a singleapproach
or a point of view," said the first report, which
deals with regulatory appointments.

Spain opens relations with U.S.S.R.
Madrid — Spain reestablished diplomatic re
lations with the Soviet Union yesterday, ending a
nearly 40-year rift that began when Francisco
Franco's rightists won the Spanish civil war.
A few hours after the announcements in Mad
rid and Moscow, King Juan Carlos began a mis
sion to heal another rift of the Franco years by
flying to Rome for a meeting with Pope Paul VI —
the first visit by a Spanish ruler to a Roman
Catholic pontiff since 1923.
Reestablishment of the Soviet diplomatic tie
came just a day after the Spanish government
decreed a law that could result in legalization of
theCommunist party. Itallows the supreme court
to decide the legal status of political parties in
stead of the cabinet.
Spain also renewed relations yesterday with
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the last two coun
tries in the Soviet bloc without diplomatic ties to
Spain.
S. African students protest exams
Johannesburg — Black Students in the sprawl
ing Soweto ghetto built bonfires of school books
and sang "We Shall Overcome" in demonstra
tions yesterday against taking final examinations
put off since last year.
Classes were disrupted for the day, but au
thorities ordered all students to be in their clas
srooms between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. today under a
curfew threatening tough action against youths
found on the streets during school hours.
The order followed demonstrations by some
6000 students in the strictly segregated city of
more than one million blacks located 10 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.
Riot police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of
an estimated 4000 students at a high school in the
Meadowlands district.
The examinations were postponed last year by

antigovernment rioting in Soweto that later
spread to other black townships throughout the
country. Some 500 blacks were reported killed in
the riots.
Student militants oppose the exams because
release of arrested student leaders, reforms in
black education and other demands made during
last year's unrest have not been met.
Steelworkers elect new president

1.4-million-member union.
The AP figures, compiled from reports to the
union's district offices, gave Mcßride 296,053
and Sadlowski 193,192 at 3593 of the union's
5000 locals.
