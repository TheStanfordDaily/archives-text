# LOTS gets memory expansion
## 
### Steve Schiller 
A large addition has been made to the memory unit in the
computer at the Low Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) com
puting facility, according to Manager Ralph Gorin.
Because of the addition, made last Wednesday, the com
puter responds to users' commands much faster than it did
when the system began running in January.
At that time the machine had only half of its designed
256,000 bits of memory because of delays by the manufac
turer.
Since the additional memory was installed, LOTS is "de
livering twice as much of the machine as before," said
Gorin. Previously, computing time was absorbed as the
machine manipulated data on its disc storage system. Gorin
estimated that the percentage of total machine time the
users receive has doubled since the installation.
The proposed transfer of Gomputer Science 105 and 106
from the Stanford Center for Information Processing (SGIP),
the main campus computer, to LOTS has been postponed
from spring to summer quarter, according to Gorin.
Reason for delay
The installation of 16 additional terminals will not be
finished until two weeks into spring quarter and adding
approximately 200 users to LOTS before that time "won't
do a whole lot of good," said Gorin.
In addition, the Computer Science Department will have
to reorganize its teaching of Computer Science 105 and 106
in order to use LOTS, he said.
Dennis Brown, a lecturer in that department, agreed, cau

tioning that "a lot of changes need to be done" as faculty
members convert their courses from SCIP to LOTS.
This conversion will have "a major impact on introduc
tory courses," making these courses "harder to teach,'' said
brown.
Because of the interactive character of LOTS, students
must learn how to use the terminal operating code and text
editing functions before beginning to program, according
to Gorin.
Thus, Computer Science 105 and 106 will change from
courses in programming to courses in "how to use a compu
ter," Gorin said.
Praise for LOTS
Brown, who teaches a course on LOTS this quarter, has
high praise for the interactive character of the facility.
LOTS, he said, has a "general, overall sophistication"
which exposes students to the "power of computing."
Tentative expansion plans call for a number of remote
terminals to be installed in Cedar Hall and the new Terman
engineering building.
In addition, a proposal to double the disc storage capacity
of the machine "will likely be approved," according to
Gorin.
Kor the short term, Gorin said he would like to see more
courses on LOTS for spring quarter because "we can handle
it."
The long term goal for the facility, Brown said, "is to get
all course computing onto LOTS."
