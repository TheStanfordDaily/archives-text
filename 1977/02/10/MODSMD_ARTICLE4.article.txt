# Vendors draw complaints
## Meat fraud investigated 
### Kurt Cobb 
The Santa Clara County District At
torney's office is looking into com
plaints that vendors working from
trucks are selling steaks short in
weight and of poor quality in this and
other Bay Area counties, according to
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Popolizio.
Kelly Keniston, a Main Library assis
tant, said she purchased short
weighted, inferior quality meat from
such a vendor last month.
The vendor approached heron cam
pus, saying he had steaks for a profes
sor here, said Keniston. The salesman
said he could not find the professor
and would sell the meat to her at a
large discount because he could not
return it to the original seller, said
Keniston. She has filed a complaint
with the county Department of Con
sumer Affairs.
Keniston said the name "Blue Star
Meat Co." appeared on the box of
steaks she bought. Senior Health
Physicist John Holmes, who also
purchased steaks from such a vendor,
said the boxes of steaks he purchased
were labeled "Packed for Arrow Meat
Co."
Charles Lemoine, owner of both
Blue Star in San Leandro and Arrow in
Sunnyvale confirmed that the meat
was packed by his companies. About
three years ago, Lemoine was named
in a San Francisco preliminary injunc
tion preventing Tully & Co. Meats Inc.
from misrepresenting the quality of its

meat.
Lemoine said his drivers are inde
pendent contractors who buy meat
from Arrow and Blue Star. But he said
he was unaware of any complaints
about meat packed by his companies.
In reference to the recent rash of
complaints in the Bay Area concerning
steak sales by vendors Lemoine said,
"We don't supply (those vendors)."
He added that all meat packed by his
companies is "100 per cent guaran
teed." This guarantee is extended to
the consumer through the contractor
who should make restitution for any
unsatisfactory meat, said Lemoine. If
the contractor fails to do this the com
pany will, he added.

According to complaints received
thus far. the vendor often claimed he
had just made a delivery and was un
able to sell all his steaks, said Henry
Eales, supervising inspector at the
county's Division of Weights and Mea
sures.
The drivers promised substantial
savings on "choice." "prime" and "re
staurant" cuts, according to the com
plaints. Short weight and poor quality
were cited in the complaints and com
plainants reported paying as much as
$6 a pound for poor quality meat.
The complainants also said the driv
ers sell their meat by the portion (by
the steak). California state law requires
meat to be sold by weight.

The vendor approached heron cam
pus, saying he had steaks for a profes
sor here, said Keniston. The salesman
said he could not find the professor
and would sell the meat to her at a
large discount because he could not
return it to the original seller, said
Keniston. She has filed a complaint
with the county Department of Con
sumer Affairs.
Keniston said the name "Blue Star
Meat Co." appeared on the box of
steaks she bought. Senior Health
Physicist John Holmes, who also
purchased steaks from such a vendor,
said the boxes of steaks he purchased
were labeled "Packed for Arrow Meat
Co."
Charles Lemoine, owner of both
Blue Star in San Leandro and Arrow in
Sunnyvale confirmed that the meat
was packed by his companies. About
three years ago, Lemoine was named
in a San Francisco preliminary injunc
tion preventing Tully & Co. Meats Inc.
from misrepresenting the quality of its

meat.
Lemoine said his drivers are inde
pendent contractors who buy meat
from Arrow and Blue Star. But he said
he was unaware of any complaints
about meat packed by his companies.
In reference to the recent rash of
complaints in the Bay Area concerning
steak sales by vendors Lemoine said,
"We don't supply (those vendors)."
He added that all meat packed by his
companies is "100 per cent guaran
teed." This guarantee is extended to
the consumer through the contractor
who should make restitution for any
unsatisfactory meat, said Lemoine. If
the contractor fails to do this the com
pany will, he added.

According to complaints received
thus far. the vendor often claimed he
had just made a delivery and was un
able to sell all his steaks, said Henry
Eales, supervising inspector at the
county's Division of Weights and Mea
sures.
The drivers promised substantial
savings on "choice." "prime" and "re
staurant" cuts, according to the com
plaints. Short weight and poor quality
were cited in the complaints and com
plainants reported paying as much as
$6 a pound for poor quality meat.
The complainants also said the driv
ers sell their meat by the portion (by
the steak). California state law requires
meat to be sold by weight.
The Santa Clara County District At
torney's office is looking into com
plaints that vendors working from
trucks are selling steaks short in
weight and of poor quality in this and
other Bay Area counties, according to
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Popolizio.
Kelly Keniston, a Main Library assis
tant, said she purchased short
weighted, inferior quality meat from
such a vendor last month.
