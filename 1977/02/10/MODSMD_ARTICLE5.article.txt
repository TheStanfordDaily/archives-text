# Fundraising costs called reasonable
## 
### Mike Charison 
The cost of fundraising here is "on
the high side" but "well within a
reasonable range," according to a re
port presented to the Hoard of Trustees
Monday at its meeting in Los Angeles.
The report, compiled and presented
by |oel Smith, assistant to the vice
president for development, compared
cost per dollar raised figures herewith
those at three other major private uni
versities around the country.
The study also compared the cost
per dollar raised now with that of the
past. The report concluded with a
warning that costs are rising faster
than gifts.
"Stanford has really been dramati
cally successful in fundraising, and
. . . when the costs are reasonable,
there could be a tendency to ignore the
costs," Smith said. He warned the
Universiy to carefully monitor
costs.
In the 1975-76 academic year, the
cost per dollar raised here was 7.7
cents. Costs attributable to fundraising
were over $3.2 million while $41.8
million was received in gifts, accord
ing to the report.
Figures for other universities sur
veyed were not released due to Uni
versity pledges of confidentiality, but
the figures were generally lower in
costs.
'Reasonable' figures
Smith listed figures of between six
and 10 cents per dollar raised as
"reasonable" figures for cost.
Smith said his report was probably
the most systematic and complicated
investigation of its type ever. Rela
tively recent concern about cost
prompted the work, which took seven
months to complete, with various ad
ditional reports, he said.
The report splits fundraising costs
into five major program thrust areas:
annual fund, major gifts, corporations,
foundations and trusts and bequests.
Of these, annual fund costs were the
highest with an average cost of nearly
34 cents per dollar over the last three
academic years. Smith said, however,
that the figure is somewhat mislead
ing.
"Annual fund is a way lots of people
begin to support a University as
donors or volunteers; therefore in
volvement is a very important objec
tive of the annual fund," he said.
It is wrong to see the dollars re
turned as the only return on the costs,
Smith said.
Beneficial impact
"An annual fund has a very benefi
cial impact on other programs," he
commented. "Major gifts and trust

gifts are substantially affected by a
successful annual gift program."
It is common for someone to donate
a large sum of money to the University
due, at least in part, to information and
work of the annual fund program, said
Smith. This is why the trust and be
quest category of gifts cost only an av
erage of 1.43 cents over the last three
academic years, he explained.
Smith said he is working on a set of
projections on fundraising costs and
results. A rough estimate included in
the report said that if both costs and
gifts rise at the same rate as they did
between 1960-61 and 1975-76, average
annual costs per dollar raised will
jump to 14.95 cents in the five years
between 1991-92 and 1995-96. Gifts,
however, would reach $130.6 million.
These long-range figures are the real
value of the report, according to Ken
neth Cuthbertson. vice president for
development and head of the Cam
paign for Stanford, which is scheduled
to end April 30.
The University had been aware thnt
costs were rising faster than gifts, said
Cuthbertson, but no one had bothered
to assess the impact of the problem
until Smith brought attention to the
figures.
'Trying harder'
In the report, Smith commented that
"Stanford is reaching further â€” trying
