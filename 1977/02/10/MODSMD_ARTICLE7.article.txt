# Parent loan procedures discussed

### Mike Charison 
Parents participating in the new pa
rent loan program next fall may never
see the money, according to Director of
Finance Rodney Adams, administrator
of the program.
The program, approved Monday by
the Hoard of Trustees, will allow pa
rents with annual gross incomes bet
ween $20,U00 and $60,000 to borrow
up to $6000 annually to help meet the
costs of tuition, room and board. The
program begins with theClass of 1981.
The University would prefer inter
nal transfer of funds to guard against
possible misuse of the money it is
lending, said Adams. The decision on
this procedure has not yet been made,
he said.
Adams said that in every detail ex
cept loan approval, the program will
be administered by the Knight
Agency, an independent firm.
Knight also handles Harvard's pa
rent loan program, which is the model
for the University's program. The Har
vard plan was implemented on a trial
basis last fall.
Rate not set
Adams said no exact interest rate on
the loans has been set. Amendments in
the resolution approved by the trustees
mandated that the program be both
self-sufficient and give an eight per
cent return to the investment pool.
The trustees allowed up to a 0.75 per
cent additional interest charge to cover
administrative costs and build a re
serve fund for bad debts, but no set
figure was named, said Adams.
He added he is "99 per cent sure"
thatanB.7s percent overall rate will be
used.
However, that H. 75 per cent figure
might be lowered if the University de
cided to defer some loan costs by as
sessing an initial loan charge at the
outset, Adams said. This idea is not
widely favored, however, he said, be
cause, among other tlii ngs, it penalizes
the parent who repays the loan ahead
of schedule.
Current University estimates predict
that approximately 10 per cent of next
fall's incoming freshman class will he
eligible for the program.
