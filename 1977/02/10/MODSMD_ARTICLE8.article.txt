## Opinions Tenure plan 'advantageous'

Last week the Daily and Campus
Report printed the "Report of the
ASSU Task Force on Tenure and
Teaching Quality." The task force
report is the result of over six months
of work by a group of students, faculty
and one administrator. The release of
the report begins what we hope will be
a thorough and stimulating public dis
cussion of the issues raised by theTask
Force.
One conclusion of the task force re
port is that a discrepancy exists bet
ween University policy statements re
garding the relative weights of teach-

ing and research in tenure and promo
tion hearings, and the actual applica
tion of those policies. In short, al
though the policy statements of the
three schools that do undergraduate
teaching (Humanities and Sciences,
Engineering and Earth Sciences)
encourage symmetry between re
search and teaching, research com
monly receives a greater emphasis in
the actual promotional hearings.
A survey of the faculty, conducted
last year, indicated that 90 per cent
believe research to be "extremely" or
"very" influential in rewarding fa
culty, while only 12 per cent perceive

teaching to carry the same importance.
Furthermore, 54 per cent felt that the
relative weight given to teaching
should be increased, and almost a
third favored reducing the relative
weight currently accorded research.
This is not to say that a majority of
faculty favor a subsidiary role for the
value of research in tenure decisions.
In fact, in response to a question re
garding their preference for the policy
"most appropriate for Stanford," most
expressed a desire that teaching and
research receive equal weight.
The task force makes five recom
mendations aimed at increasing the
importance of teaching in tenure and
promotions decisions. We would like
to focus upon that recommendation
(number one) which calls for the in
stitution of a mandatory course evalua
tion at Stanford.
The task force recommends that
eveiy course with an enrollment of at
least eight students be evaluated every
time it is offered. The recommendation
allows for certain exceptions to this
evaluative process; for example, a new
course offering or an experimental
course need not be evaluated in the
usual way the first time it is given. The
thrust of recommendation one is clear,
however, in that the task force recog
nized the need for a centralized, un
iform system of course evaluation by
students. Currently, individual de
partments in Humanities and Sciences
are responsible for choosing their own

means of evaluating the teaching qual
ity of the faculty. A more systematic
form of evaluation would reduce some
of the pressure on individual depart
ments to design an independent
means of measuring teaching quality.
It is worth noting that a similar sys
tem of teaching evaluation has been
operating successfully at Princeton for
the past seven years. We believe that
such a system would be advantageous
for students and faculty here. Students
could be assured that quantitative in
formation regarding teaching quality
would be considered on a systematic
basis, along with qualitative teaching
assessments and data on research qual
ity, in tenure and promotions proceed
ings. Faculty could be confident that
teaching evaluation data would be col
lected and compiled in a professional
manner.
Presently, the "Report of the ASSU
Task Force on Tenure and Teaching
Quality" is being considered by the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA) Subcom
mittee on the Evaluation and Im
provement of Teaching. We hope that
it will be considered by the Faculty
Senate before the end of the academic
year and we urge all members of the
Stanford community to read and voice
their opinions on this recently
released report.

are responsible for choosing their own

means of evaluating the teaching qual
ity of the faculty. A more systematic
form of evaluation would reduce some
of the pressure on individual depart
ments to design an independent
means of measuring teaching quality.
It is worth noting that a similar sys
tem of teaching evaluation has been
operating successfully at Princeton for
the past seven years. We believe that
such a system would be advantageous
for students and faculty here. Students
could be assured that quantitative in
formation regarding teaching quality
would be considered on a systematic
basis, along with qualitative teaching
assessments and data on research qual
ity, in tenure and promotions proceed
ings. Faculty could be confident that
teaching evaluation data would be col
lected and compiled in a professional
manner.
Presently, the "Report of the ASSU
Task Force on Tenure and Teaching
Quality" is being considered by the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA) Subcom
mittee on the Evaluation and Im
provement of Teaching. We hope that
it will be considered by the Faculty
Senate before the end of the academic
year and we urge all members of the
Stanford community to read and voice
their opinions on this recently
released report.

Last week the Daily and Campus
Report printed the "Report of the
ASSU Task Force on Tenure and
Teaching Quality." The task force
report is the result of over six months
of work by a group of students, faculty
and one administrator. The release of
the report begins what we hope will be
a thorough and stimulating public dis
cussion of the issues raised by theTask
Force.
One conclusion of the task force re
port is that a discrepancy exists bet
ween University policy statements re
garding the relative weights of teach-

ing and research in tenure and promo
tion hearings, and the actual applica
tion of those policies. In short, al
though the policy statements of the
three schools that do undergraduate
teaching (Humanities and Sciences,
Engineering and Earth Sciences)
encourage symmetry between re
search and teaching, research com
monly receives a greater emphasis in
the actual promotional hearings.
A survey of the faculty, conducted
last year, indicated that 90 per cent
believe research to be "extremely" or
"very" influential in rewarding fa
culty, while only 12 per cent perceive

teaching to carry the same importance.
Furthermore, 54 per cent felt that the
relative weight given to teaching
should be increased, and almost a
third favored reducing the relative
weight currently accorded research.
This is not to say that a majority of
faculty favor a subsidiary role for the
value of research in tenure decisions.
In fact, in response to a question re
garding their preference for the policy
"most appropriate for Stanford," most
expressed a desire that teaching and
research receive equal weight.
The task force makes five recom
mendations aimed at increasing the
importance of teaching in tenure and
promotions decisions. We would like
to focus upon that recommendation
(number one) which calls for the in
stitution of a mandatory course evalua
tion at Stanford.
The task force recommends that
eveiy course with an enrollment of at
least eight students be evaluated every
time it is offered. The recommendation
allows for certain exceptions to this
evaluative process; for example, a new
course offering or an experimental
course need not be evaluated in the
usual way the first time it is given. The
thrust of recommendation one is clear,
however, in that the task force recog
nized the need for a centralized, un
iform system of course evaluation by
students. Currently, individual de
partments in Humanities and Sciences
are responsible for choosing their own

means of evaluating the teaching qual
ity of the faculty. A more systematic
form of evaluation would reduce some
of the pressure on individual depart
ments to design an independent
means of measuring teaching quality.
