# Get money off Capitol Hill

Public reaction to the South Korean
bribe scandal late last year was im
mediate outrage and disgust. How
could U.S. congressmen and senators
fall prey to monetary coercion? The
American public was and still is con
cerned over the possibility that foreign
capital may be deciding domestic pol
icy, a sure sign of failure in our democ
ratic system.
But the public is overlooking a more
immediate and perhaps more danger
ous threat to the integrity of U.S.
Ijvv-makers —private financing of
congressional campaigns.
Business, professional, labor and ag
ricultural special interest groups
poured almost $25 million into con
gressional races last year, nearly dou
ble the 1974 figure. Much of that $25
million would have gone to presiden
tial candidates if stricter campaign
laws had not been instituted in 1973.
Campaign contributions buy politi
cal access, Capitol Hill's most valuable
commodity. A private transportation
company might contribute heavily to
an influential member of the Senate
Subcommittee on Surface Transporta
tion hoping to buy valuable support on
crucial legislation.
There is ample testimony to the fact

that this system works. The number of
corporate "political action commit
tees" rose from 85 in 1974 to more than
400 in 1976.
In effect, special interest campaign
contributions are lobbying measures
which successfully circumvent the
stringent Lobby Disclosure Act of
1976.
Financial disclosure is clearly not
enough. Records of campaign con
tributions, available to the public
through Federal Election Commission
(FEC) records are in themselves not
alarming. But special interest con
tributions, normally limited to $5000
per election, may be funneled through
political action committees and local
party organizations, obscuring their
source and lending them a certain leg
ality.
The fact that Carter doesn't belong to
special interests is a step in the right
direction. But this is hardly sufficient.
If the president were to propose legis
lation calling for financial accounta
bility, congressional special interests
would successfully pigeonhole it.
The 95th Congress owes more al
legiance to business than to the presi
dent.

Admittedly problems exist in the
new system used to finance the 1976
presidential campaigns. The tax
checkoff method resulted in low
spending limits and reduced voter par
ticipation. Furthermore there were no
matching funds provided for serious
third party candidates.
Another serious problem which sur
faced during the congressional races
was the U.S. Supreme Court ruling
which invalidated federal limits on the
amount that a candidate could spend
on his or her own campaign.
The ruling clearly gives an unfair
political advantage to the wealthy
candidate. One candidate poured
more than $2 million of personal funds
into his senatorial bid — more than
any other Senate candidate raised from
all outside contributors.
An alternative must be found to pro
tect the integrity of representative
government.
The tax-checkoff system must be ex
panded to congress and must allow the
imposition of limits on personal ex
penditures while providing for the
viability of third party candidates.
