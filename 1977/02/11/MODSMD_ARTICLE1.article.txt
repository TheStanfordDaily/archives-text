Firemen break a window to gain access to a fire
yesterday afternoon in the organic chemistry build
ing. According to fire Captain John Foley, the fire
started when a student used alcohol to clean out a
beaker in which he had been mixing a lithium-

aluminum hydride compound. The mixture ignited
and produced "highly toxic" fumes, forcing the evacu
ation of the building. The fire was quickly brought
under control but caused an estimated $200 damage
to the lab area.
