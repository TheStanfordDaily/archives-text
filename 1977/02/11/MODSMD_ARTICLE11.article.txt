# No more 'letting go'
## 
### 
It was almost like going to church. Jimi Hendrix,
the High Priest of Hippies, was in town at the Min
neapolis Armory. This psychedelic sorcerer of acid
rock would intone his amplified high mass with
clouds of green incense filling the hall. He would
shake riffs off his guitar neck and fling them like holy
water over the surging, turned-on congregation.
The year was 1970. Nixon was president,
Woodstock had happened and Vietnam raged on. To
see Jimi Hendrix in concert was not simply a casual
jaunt to hear some music. It was an act of rebellion, a
defiant clenched fist raised against the present age
and a celebration of the new order to come.
I was only 15 back then. I had grown up in the
small town of Mound, Minnesota, the headquarters
of Tonka Toys. My friends had cajoled me against my
better judgment into going to see Hendrix. I was not
going simply to hear some music, but enter the leftist
abyss of hell, the den of of iniquity of the long
haired, dope-smoking, bomb-throwing, free-sexing,
Communist traitors. I was scared stiff. Would they
scoff at my mod-but-conservative haircut? Would
they force me to take drugs? Would the blasts of
music forever destroy my hearing? I wished I hadn't
come.
Strange bedfellows
We sat down on some screechy metal bleachers
midway back from the stage. Next to me slumped a
fat hippie with burlap hair. Wine dribbled across his
belly, perfectly bisecting the peace symbol on his
t-shirt. In his hand, he clutched a bottle of Boone's
Farm Strawberry Hill. He belched, slid the bottle to
his lips and swigged it dry. He clumsily clunked it
on the floor next to a half dozen empties and
promptly passed out.
I scanned the rest of the hall. Darkened, hairy
forms clad in army jackets and tie-dyed shirts cla
mored and buzzed around us. They desired only one
thing: Hendrix.
Jimi strutted onstage. The crowd exploded. He
wore tight, iridescent jeans that shimmered in the
footlights, with a black shirt open at the neck and a

gold vest. A leather headband help back his moun
tain of hair. The crowd hooted and stomped as Jimi
strapped on his axe and roared into his first song.

This was too much for me. 1 looked carefully to
make sure no one was watching and then slipped a
length of toilet paper from my pocket. I tore off two
pieces, rolled them into little wads and stuffed them
into my ears. My hearing was safe now, but I felt like
a fool. "Cool guvs" didn't need earplugs.

Jimi Hendrix was an awesome master of the guitar.
He blasted chords like cannon balls. He pounced
over the frets like a panther. He could coax anything
out of his guitar. Anything.
Star Spangled Banner
During his last encore, someone in the balcony
unfurled an American flag. It had a white peace
symbol in the blue field where the stars should have
been. Jimi clicked on his fuzz box, whipped up the
volume on his stack of amps and boomed out his
version of the Star Spangled Banner, as he had done
at Woodstock the summer before. This song was both
the death dirge of the older generation's plastic soci
ety and the flourish to herald the new era of peace,
brotherhood and freedom for all.
Much has happened since then. The Vietnam war
ended, Nixon left office, Hendrix died. New
superstars came onto the rock scene. During the
summer of 1976,1 saw one of those new superstars in
concert, Elton John. He performed at the new St. Paul
Civic Center, a gracefully curved building with sleek

white lights and shiny walls.
The people who came were far different from the
concertgoers of six years earlier. Double-knit boys in
flowered shirts sauntered in with their stylish,
blow-combed dates. They sunk into the cushy red
chairs with a beer in one hand and an official "Elton
John" program, bought from stadium vendors, in the
other. Plastic pouches of marijuana tucked away in
shirt pockets were the only things inherited from
their hippie elders.
Restrained cool
Elton John waddled onstage, dressed in black
pants and a green-sequined jacket with a golden
banana on a long cord slung around his neck. The
"Liberace of the Seventies" sat down at his plastic
piano that flicked on and off like a Christmas tree. He
blasted into his first song like a Concorde jet, but the
restrained crowd only tapped its toes and clapped
politely, because "letting go might appear foolish
in front of one's date.
Elton pounded his keyboard and churned out pure
brilliance. But this was not the musicofrevolution, it
was the music of escape and prosperity.
A Grand Canyon of difference separated this group
of swinging singles from their older brothers and
sisters. They seemed to be saying, "The revolution is
dead. This is the dawning of the Age of Young
Apathy." As Christian philosopher Francis Schaef
fer put it, the young generation has sold out for "two
impoverished values, personal peace and afflu
ence."
But the sixties were no idyllic Utopia either. The
beauty that was Woodstock turned ugly at Altamont
and was blown apart by the bombs of Wisconsin.
Even Jimi Hendrix, the god of the last age, choked
to death on his own vomit in a London flat from a
drug overdose.
His death may have a profound meaning for us
today. It leads us to ask the question the Bible asked,
"For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole
world and forfeits his life?"
