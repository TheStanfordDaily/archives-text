Germany revisited
We protest the Daily's new, neo-
Hitlerian flag. Only the presumptu
ousness of the editorial page exceeds
the pomposity of this new masthead.
This pseudo-Gothic tripe is as stirring
as a Bavarian rum cake. We suggest
you advise the Daily Trojan of your
typesetter.

'Daring'
May I express my admiration for the
new elegant style of the Daily's flag.
Those Gothic letters provide a basic
lesson in paleography for the un
learned public. The change constitutes
a symbolic gesture of the Daily's
philosophy of daring to be different. It
even suggests that in accuracy of news
reporting the Daily will seek to emu
late the Zuricher Zeitung. Carry on
bravely!

In a nutshell
1 must confess that I was much im
pressed by Glenn Jordan's column
(Daily, Feb. 9), for it is not often one
encounters a journalist — even a Daily
columnist — willing to take on so pro
digious a task as the indictment of
2500 years of western civilization in
the space of some 22 column inches.
It should not have surprised me,
however, after having read his previ
ous column, which in a similar space
and employing the same innovative,
tunnel-vision historiography, reduced
capitalism to racism and the United
States to a world tyrant.

How charming it was to discover
such novel historical "facts" as:
—all western societies, even feudal
ones, were driven by capitalistic av
arice. Such men as Memmi, Althusser,
Marcuse and Fanon were as important
to western history and culture as Plato,
Hegel, Freud, Marx and Jefferson.
—capitalism caused racism. The
West has, and always had, a monopoly
on racism and slavery. There is some
thing peculiar to moneyed Caucasian
westerners that makes them all want to
be Hitlers.
Why it's all so simple! Why didn't
we all see it before? I suppose it took a
consummate historian such as Jordan

(whose fund of knowledge must cer
tainly be vast for him to presume to
such sweeping generalizations) to
explain it to us.
I plan to immediately drop out of the
modern Europe series and wait for Jor
dan to publish the definitive work.

Water shortage
With the East Bay and Marin County
already rationing water and a "water
emergency" declared in San Fran
cisco, Stanford will probably be forced

to reduce water consumption substan
tially. Why hasn't Stanford done any
thing to even encourage students to
conserve water? Past experiences
prove that voluntary compliance
rarely occurs without some prodding.
The sooner we start, the better for all.
Reminders like the old "off it" stic
kers would at least keep people con
stantly aware of our water crisis and
reducing the spray and length of
showers would help reduce waste in
the dorms. Unless we act now the dry
season ahead will result in severe re
strictions on our water use.
