# Caught in our own chains

"The road to hell is paved with good
intentions."
Contemporary American society is
faced with a troubling example of the
old adage. Increasingly, we seem to be
caught up in a system wherein libera
tion becomes oppression, indi
vidualism turns into conformity, the
dialectical process is replaced by
something resembling a cross between
a brainwashing and a revival meeting.
Charles Frankel of Columbia Uni
versity has termed this phenomenon
"conceptual overflow" — the carrying
of a good idea to its illogical extreme.
The end result is a Machiavellian per
version: not only does the end justify
the means, but the means often become
ends in themselves.
Forgetting the past
At Stanford, it rarely takes more than
a few political discussions for the
symptoms to manifest themselves.

Everyone is free to "find his identity"
— except that traditional roles must be
discarded out of hand. We are very
concerned about "human rights" —
except the rights of those who wish to
work for a company with which we
have a grievance, real or imaginary.
"Feminism" is a high priority, but
"femininity" is a sexist word.
A subtle process, conceptual over
flow perniciously erodes away at all
levels of human action and interac
tion. It causes us to overlook historical
perspective in order to satisfy some
immediate emotional impulse. Con
versely, we may ignore present
realities in favor of wallowing in the
slime of past mistakes.
Non-opinion
Vacuous phrases such as "racist
sexist-capitalist-imperialist" serve to
dismiss and/or suppress the voices ol
dissent (remember "communist" and

"law and order?"). We may hesitate to
form, or at least express, an intelligent
opinion, for fear of being censured for
making "value judgments." Perhaps
the epitome of all this is to be found at
Trinity College, where one can now be
suspended for telling jokes of a racial
or religious nature.
When one set of coerced values
supplants another, the result is not lib
eration. We relate to each other not as
people, but as images — angry
minority/repentant white, ex
chauvinist/liberated woman. The end
result is a form of slavery more insidi
ous than any imposed by external
forces. For, as Nathaniel Hawthorne in
The Scarlet Letter wrote, "No man . . .
can wear one face to himself, and
another to the multitude, without fi
nally getting bewildered as to which
may be the true."
