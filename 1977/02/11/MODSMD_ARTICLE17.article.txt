# Manzanita a Hooverville? Maybe yes, maybe no

In Spanish, Manzanita means
"little apples," but here it has
come to represent something de
cidedly less beguiling.
Trailers.
North of Escondido Road,
hidden from view by carefully
cultivated hedges lie the dingy
white, utilitarian shells that
house myriad students each
year. Some of them have
nicknamed the park "Hoover
ville" after a famous Stanford
graduate.
With 14 clusters, four trailers
to each cluster, Manzanita in
cludes a fairly high percentage
of on-campus living quarters.
The question is why. . . .
Seven years ago, when the
trailers were first installed as a
stopgap emergency housing
measure, housing officials
promised that the structures
would grace campus grounds for
a mere five years. That was how
long the buildings and their fur
niture were expected to last. Yet
last summer, new furniture and
showers were installed, and it
looks like the trailers are here to

stay — at least for a while.
Oscar Nelson, the University's
master planner, sums up the
situation: "temporary is an end
less word around the Univer
sity." He cites as an example the
surplus army shelters that were
purchased inexpensively in the
mid-19405. They were only sup
posed to be in use for a few years,
but it wasn't until the late 1960s
that they were finally removed.
Contrary to popular belief,
Manzanita is not the lowest
number in the draw. "However,"
says Norm Robinson, acting as
sociate dean of student affairs,
"it's pretty close." It was aced
out of this position in last
spring's draw by Burbank and
Serra. Despite increased demand
for on-campus housing, there are
presently 30 unfilled places in
the trailers. This reflects the
"pariah " image that Manzanita
has come to project.
Isolation
One of the predominant
reasons for this image is the iso
lation that residents of the trail
ers are forced to deal with. "The
trailer community is not as

tight-knit or activity-oriented as
the dorms are," comments
Robinson.
Wendy Hawkins, Manzanita
Park manager, feels that part of
the negative attitude lies in the
fact that many of the residents
are sophomores coming from
all-freshman dorms. "We just
can't compete with the special
atmosphere or, rather, rowdi
ness of freshman dorms. A lot of
the blame is unjustly put on
Manzanita, when it is the stu
dents themselves who are hav
ing trouble adjusting their ex
pectations. Manzanita is basi
cally a neighborhood, not a
single living unit."
As to the complaints about the
lack of social life, Hawkins says

University officials call it temporary housing, but
the trailers at Manzanita Park have been around
for an awful long time. And it looks like they'll be
around for a little bit longer - if they don't fall
apart first.

that social affairs, up to now,
have been moderately success
ful. "It's impossible to plan for
any cohesive, all-park events
since t he park is so large. Most ot
the parties and study breaks in
clude only the various clusters,
so that people can get to know
their immediate neighbors."
The physical appearance of
the box-like structures defies
any attempt at exterior enliven
ment. Besides ringing the trail
ers with a camouflaging hedge,
the Planning Office has declared
a moratorium on any landscap
ing. In defense, Nelson says,
"After all, the trailers are only
temporary housing."
Although most students as
signed to Manzanita achieve a

grudging acceptance of their
fate, many truly enjoy trailer life
and wouldn't trade it for any
thing short of a garden apart
ment with southern exposure at
558 Mayfield.
One such person is Bob, from
31W, who love? his new life
style. He says, "You don't have to
put up with the BS that comes
with dorm living. My freshman
dorm was just like Peyton Place
— a lot of little cliques, with
everyone knowing everybody
else's business."
His major complaint echoes
those of other residents: "You
don't get to know the people liv
ing in the trailers around you.
Everyone keeps pretty much to
themselves and their own circle
of friends."
Another resident presents a
slightly more negative view
point. "There's just no privacy,"
he claims. "The walls are just
like paper. One of my roommates
had this girlfriend who used to
sleep over on the weekends. I
swear, I must know the details of
their sex life intimately."
There are various forms of
animal life residing in and
around Manzanita. One student,
who lived in the park three years
ago, played father to a litter of
orphaned kittens which lived
under his doorstep. He also was
allergic to cats. "It was in the
spring," he says."I just couldn't
figure out why I had a cold for
two months when it was 90 de
grees outside."
Green and orange
The new innovations seem to
have found even less favor. "The
vinyl furniture is really shitty,"

relates one resident. "It makes
you sweat and then you stick to it
and a few minutes later, your
body starts to feel itchy all over.
The puke-green and orange car
peting is also really offensive."
When it's cold out, it's often
freezing "in," due to pipe dam
age. In the summer, the trailers
take on the features of giant
ovens. And if it happens to fi
nally rain, one had better be
well-armed with pesticides, be
cause, according to one resident,
"the ants descend in droves."
But there are positive aspects
to the trailers and people search
hard to find more of them. Ac
cording to Robinson, "They are
comparatively roomy, with each
unit having its own living/
dining room, a fairly decent
kitchen, three bedrooms and a
shower. The location is also re
ally good."
Hawkins says that the cause of
many of the bad features is that
"since the trailers were origi
nally supposed to be only tem
porary dwellings, the University

only made a very minimal in
vestment in them. This explains
the crumbling shower floors
(one student actually fell
through the floor once), the thin
walls, and the lack of book
shelves, etc. In purchasing furni
ture, the University mainly
looked for durability and cheap
ness. This limits color choices
and models that can be consi
dered."
According to Nelson, there are
no immediate plans for housing
to replace Manzanita Park, un
less of course the University
suddenly receives a windfall
donation totaling the couple of
million dollars needed. So it
looks like there is no definite
date set for the trailers' removal.
But their demise might come
sooner than anyone in the Hous
ing Office plans. "Lately we've
had to make quite a few repairs,"
says Hawkins. "I think that the
trailers will have to be replaced
long before the University has
any housing built to substitute
for them."

Manzanita is not the lowest
number in the draw. "However,"
says Norm Robinson, acting as
sociate dean of student affairs,
"it's pretty close." It was aced
out of this position in last
spring's draw by Burbank and
Serra. Despite increased demand
for on-campus housing, there are
presently 30 unfilled places in
the trailers. This reflects the
"pariah " image that Manzanita
has come to project.
Isolation
One of the predominant
reasons for this image is the iso
lation that residents of the trail
ers are forced to deal with. "The
trailer community is not as

tight-knit or activity-oriented as
the dorms are," comments
Robinson.
Wendy Hawkins, Manzanita
Park manager, feels that part of
the negative attitude lies in the
fact that many of the residents
are sophomores coming from
all-freshman dorms. "We just
can't compete with the special
atmosphere or, rather, rowdi
ness of freshman dorms. A lot of
the blame is unjustly put on
Manzanita, when it is the stu
dents themselves who are hav
ing trouble adjusting their ex
pectations. Manzanita is basi
cally a neighborhood, not a
single living unit."
As to the complaints about the
lack of social life, Hawkins says

University officials call it temporary housing, but
the trailers at Manzanita Park have been around
for an awful long time. And it looks like they'll be
around for a little bit longer - if they don't fall
apart first.

that social affairs, up to now,
have been moderately success
ful. "It's impossible to plan for
any cohesive, all-park events
since t he park is so large. Most ot
the parties and study breaks in
clude only the various clusters,
so that people can get to know
their immediate neighbors."
The physical appearance of
the box-like structures defies
any attempt at exterior enliven
ment. Besides ringing the trail
ers with a camouflaging hedge,
the Planning Office has declared
a moratorium on any landscap
ing. In defense, Nelson says,
"After all, the trailers are only
temporary housing."
Although most students as
signed to Manzanita achieve a

grudging acceptance of their
fate, many truly enjoy trailer life
and wouldn't trade it for any
thing short of a garden apart
ment with southern exposure at
558 Mayfield.
One such person is Bob, from
31W, who love? his new life
style. He says, "You don't have to
put up with the BS that comes
with dorm living. My freshman
dorm was just like Peyton Place
— a lot of little cliques, with
everyone knowing everybody
else's business."
His major complaint echoes
those of other residents: "You
don't get to know the people liv
ing in the trailers around you.
Everyone keeps pretty much to
themselves and their own circle
of friends."
Another resident presents a
slightly more negative view
point. "There's just no privacy,"
he claims. "The walls are just
like paper. One of my roommates
had this girlfriend who used to
sleep over on the weekends. I
swear, I must know the details of
their sex life intimately."
There are various forms of
animal life residing in and
around Manzanita. One student,
who lived in the park three years
ago, played father to a litter of
orphaned kittens which lived
under his doorstep. He also was
allergic to cats. "It was in the
spring," he says."I just couldn't
figure out why I had a cold for
two months when it was 90 de
grees outside."
Green and orange
The new innovations seem to
have found even less favor. "The
vinyl furniture is really shitty,"

relates one resident. "It makes
you sweat and then you stick to it
and a few minutes later, your
body starts to feel itchy all over.
The puke-green and orange car
peting is also really offensive."
When it's cold out, it's often
freezing "in," due to pipe dam
age. In the summer, the trailers
take on the features of giant
ovens. And if it happens to fi
nally rain, one had better be
well-armed with pesticides, be
cause, according to one resident,
"the ants descend in droves."
But there are positive aspects
to the trailers and people search
hard to find more of them. Ac
cording to Robinson, "They are
comparatively roomy, with each
unit having its own living/
dining room, a fairly decent
kitchen, three bedrooms and a
shower. The location is also re
ally good."
Hawkins says that the cause of
many of the bad features is that
"since the trailers were origi
nally supposed to be only tem
porary dwellings, the University

only made a very minimal in
vestment in them. This explains
the crumbling shower floors
(one student actually fell
through the floor once), the thin
walls, and the lack of book
shelves, etc. In purchasing furni
ture, the University mainly
looked for durability and cheap
ness. This limits color choices
and models that can be consi
dered."
According to Nelson, there are
no immediate plans for housing
to replace Manzanita Park, un
less of course the University
suddenly receives a windfall
donation totaling the couple of
million dollars needed. So it
looks like there is no definite
date set for the trailers' removal.
But their demise might come
sooner than anyone in the Hous
ing Office plans. "Lately we've
had to make quite a few repairs,"
says Hawkins. "I think that the
trailers will have to be replaced
long before the University has
any housing built to substitute
for them."

looks like the trailers are here to

Oscar Nelson, the University's

situation: "temporary is an end

around for a little bit longer - if they don't fall
apart first.

that social affairs, up to now,
have been moderately success
ful. "It's impossible to plan for
any cohesive, all-park events
since t he park is so large. Most ot
the parties and study breaks in
clude only the various clusters,
so that people can get to know
their immediate neighbors."
The physical appearance of
the box-like structures defies
any attempt at exterior enliven
ment. Besides ringing the trail
ers with a camouflaging hedge,
the Planning Office has declared
a moratorium on any landscap
ing. In defense, Nelson says,
"After all, the trailers are only
temporary housing."
Although most students as
signed to Manzanita achieve a

grudging acceptance of their
fate, many truly enjoy trailer life
and wouldn't trade it for any
thing short of a garden apart
ment with southern exposure at
558 Mayfield.
One such person is Bob, from
31W, who love? his new life
style. He says, "You don't have to
put up with the BS that comes
with dorm living. My freshman
dorm was just like Peyton Place
— a lot of little cliques, with
everyone knowing everybody
else's business."
His major complaint echoes
those of other residents: "You
don't get to know the people liv
ing in the trailers around you.
Everyone keeps pretty much to
themselves and their own circle
of friends."
Another resident presents a
slightly more negative view
point. "There's just no privacy,"
he claims. "The walls are just
like paper. One of my roommates
had this girlfriend who used to
sleep over on the weekends. I
swear, I must know the details of
their sex life intimately."
There are various forms of
animal life residing in and
around Manzanita. One student,
who lived in the park three years
ago, played father to a litter of
orphaned kittens which lived
under his doorstep. He also was
allergic to cats. "It was in the
spring," he says."I just couldn't
figure out why I had a cold for
two months when it was 90 de
grees outside."
Green and orange
The new innovations seem to
have found even less favor. "The
vinyl furniture is really shitty,"

relates one resident. "It makes
you sweat and then you stick to it
and a few minutes later, your
body starts to feel itchy all over.
The puke-green and orange car
peting is also really offensive."
When it's cold out, it's often
freezing "in," due to pipe dam
age. In the summer, the trailers
take on the features of giant
ovens. And if it happens to fi
nally rain, one had better be
well-armed with pesticides, be
cause, according to one resident,
"the ants descend in droves."
But there are positive aspects
to the trailers and people search
hard to find more of them. Ac
cording to Robinson, "They are
comparatively roomy, with each
unit having its own living/
dining room, a fairly decent
kitchen, three bedrooms and a
shower. The location is also re
ally good."
Hawkins says that the cause of
many of the bad features is that
"since the trailers were origi
nally supposed to be only tem
porary dwellings, the University

only made a very minimal in
vestment in them. This explains
the crumbling shower floors
(one student actually fell
through the floor once), the thin
walls, and the lack of book
shelves, etc. In purchasing furni
ture, the University mainly
looked for durability and cheap
ness. This limits color choices
and models that can be consi
dered."
According to Nelson, there are
no immediate plans for housing
to replace Manzanita Park, un
less of course the University
suddenly receives a windfall
donation totaling the couple of
million dollars needed. So it
looks like there is no definite
date set for the trailers' removal.
But their demise might come
sooner than anyone in the Hous
ing Office plans. "Lately we've
had to make quite a few repairs,"
says Hawkins. "I think that the
trailers will have to be replaced
long before the University has
any housing built to substitute
for them."

Trailers.
North of Escondido Road,
hidden from view by carefully
cultivated hedges lie the dingy
white, utilitarian shells that
house myriad students each
year. Some of them have
nicknamed the park "Hoover
ville" after a famous Stanford
graduate.
With 14 clusters, four trailers
to each cluster, Manzanita in
cludes a fairly high percentage
of on-campus living quarters.
The question is why. . . .
Seven years ago, when the
trailers were first installed as a
stopgap emergency housing
measure, housing officials
promised that the structures
would grace campus grounds for
a mere five years. That was how
long the buildings and their fur
niture were expected to last. Yet
last summer, new furniture and
showers were installed, and it
looks like the trailers are here to

stay — at least for a while.
Oscar Nelson, the University's
master planner, sums up the
situation: "temporary is an end
less word around the Univer
sity." He cites as an example the
surplus army shelters that were
purchased inexpensively in the
mid-19405. They were only sup
posed to be in use for a few years,
but it wasn't until the late 1960s
that they were finally removed.
Contrary to popular belief,
Manzanita is not the lowest
number in the draw. "However,"
says Norm Robinson, acting as
sociate dean of student affairs,
"it's pretty close." It was aced
out of this position in last
spring's draw by Burbank and
Serra. Despite increased demand
for on-campus housing, there are
presently 30 unfilled places in
the trailers. This reflects the
"pariah " image that Manzanita
has come to project.
Isolation
One of the predominant
reasons for this image is the iso
lation that residents of the trail
ers are forced to deal with. "The
trailer community is not as

tight-knit or activity-oriented as
the dorms are," comments
Robinson.
Wendy Hawkins, Manzanita
Park manager, feels that part of
the negative attitude lies in the
fact that many of the residents
are sophomores coming from
all-freshman dorms. "We just
can't compete with the special
atmosphere or, rather, rowdi
ness of freshman dorms. A lot of
the blame is unjustly put on
Manzanita, when it is the stu
dents themselves who are hav
ing trouble adjusting their ex
pectations. Manzanita is basi
cally a neighborhood, not a

The puke-green and orange car

When it's cold out, it's often

to the trailers and people search

Hawkins says that the cause of

"since the trailers were origi
nally supposed to be only tem
porary dwellings, the University

only made a very minimal in
vestment in them. This explains
the crumbling shower floors
(one student actually fell
through the floor once), the thin
walls, and the lack of book
shelves, etc. In purchasing furni
ture, the University mainly
looked for durability and cheap
ness. This limits color choices
and models that can be consi

According to Nelson, there are
no immediate plans for housing
to replace Manzanita Park, un
less of course the University
suddenly receives a windfall
donation totaling the couple of
million dollars needed. So it
looks like there is no definite
date set for the trailers' removal.
But their demise might come
sooner than anyone in the Hous
ing Office plans. "Lately we've
had to make quite a few repairs,"
says Hawkins. "I think that the
trailers will have to be replaced
long before the University has
any housing built to substitute
for them."

In Spanish, Manzanita means
"little apples," but here it has
come to represent something de
cidedly less beguiling.
Trailers.
North of Escondido Road,
hidden from view by carefully
cultivated hedges lie the dingy
white, utilitarian shells that
house myriad students each
year. Some of them have
nicknamed the park "Hoover
ville" after a famous Stanford
graduate.
With 14 clusters, four trailers
to each cluster, Manzanita in
cludes a fairly high percentage
of on-campus living quarters.
The question is why. . . .
Seven years ago, when the
trailers were first installed as a
stopgap emergency housing
measure, housing officials
promised that the structures
would grace campus grounds for
a mere five years. That was how
long the buildings and their fur
niture were expected to last. Yet
last summer, new furniture and
showers were installed, and it
looks like the trailers are here to

stay — at least for a while.
Oscar Nelson, the University's
master planner, sums up the
situation: "temporary is an end
less word around the Univer
sity." He cites as an example the
surplus army shelters that were
purchased inexpensively in the
mid-19405. They were only sup
posed to be in use for a few years,
but it wasn't until the late 1960s
that they were finally removed.
Contrary to popular belief,
Manzanita is not the lowest
number in the draw. "However,"
says Norm Robinson, acting as
sociate dean of student affairs,
"it's pretty close." It was aced
out of this position in last
spring's draw by Burbank and
Serra. Despite increased demand
for on-campus housing, there are
presently 30 unfilled places in
the trailers. This reflects the
"pariah " image that Manzanita
has come to project.
Isolation
One of the predominant
reasons for this image is the iso
lation that residents of the trail
ers are forced to deal with. "The
trailer community is not as

tight-knit or activity-oriented as
the dorms are," comments
Robinson.
Wendy Hawkins, Manzanita
Park manager, feels that part of
the negative attitude lies in the
fact that many of the residents
are sophomores coming from
all-freshman dorms. "We just
can't compete with the special
atmosphere or, rather, rowdi
ness of freshman dorms. A lot of
the blame is unjustly put on
Manzanita, when it is the stu
dents themselves who are hav
ing trouble adjusting their ex
pectations. Manzanita is basi
cally a neighborhood, not a
single living unit."
As to the complaints about the
lack of social life, Hawkins says

University officials call it temporary housing, but
the trailers at Manzanita Park have been around
for an awful long time. And it looks like they'll be
around for a little bit longer - if they don't fall
apart first.

that social affairs, up to now,
have been moderately success
ful. "It's impossible to plan for
any cohesive, all-park events
since t he park is so large. Most ot
the parties and study breaks in
clude only the various clusters,
so that people can get to know
their immediate neighbors."
The physical appearance of
the box-like structures defies
any attempt at exterior enliven
ment. Besides ringing the trail
ers with a camouflaging hedge,
the Planning Office has declared
a moratorium on any landscap
ing. In defense, Nelson says,
"After all, the trailers are only
temporary housing."
Although most students as
signed to Manzanita achieve a

grudging acceptance of their
fate, many truly enjoy trailer life
and wouldn't trade it for any
thing short of a garden apart
ment with southern exposure at
558 Mayfield.
One such person is Bob, from
31W, who love? his new life
style. He says, "You don't have to
put up with the BS that comes
with dorm living. My freshman
dorm was just like Peyton Place
— a lot of little cliques, with
everyone knowing everybody
else's business."
His major complaint echoes
those of other residents: "You
don't get to know the people liv
ing in the trailers around you.
Everyone keeps pretty much to
themselves and their own circle
of friends."
Another resident presents a
slightly more negative view
