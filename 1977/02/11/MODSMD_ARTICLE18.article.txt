## The 						Thief of Paris 
### 
' flmCurtis Scott
Louis Malle's The Thief of
' Puris, first released in France in
• 1967. captures the intricate set of
; factors which molds a man's
• consuming obsession with his
profession, in this case, the "pro
[ fession" of stealing.
.; Malle forcefully suggests that
) the true value and meaning of
• brigandry lies, for the thief (and
the director), in his absolute
committment to his craft, over
and above all else, including the
woman he loves. The degree to
which we share his judgment
measures the success of the film.
Following his apprenticeship
with Robert Bresson, a French
master of the psychological film,
Malle refined his technique in
two "New Wave" films: Le Feu
Follet (1963) and Viva Maria
(1965).
The Thief of Paris, his third
major film, begins its
philosophical and psychologi

cal inquiries with the thief,
played by Jean Paul Belmondo,
committing a jewel theft, and
then flashes back to the course of
affairs which have brought him
to that point.
His history begins with his
learning, as a young man and the
scion of a wealthy family, that
his lecherous uncle has squan
dered his inheritance while he
was at boarding school and in
the military service. Belmondo
discovers that his intense pas
sion for his cousin, Charlotte,
has been thwarted in his absence
as she has become engaged to a
member of the wealthy Mon
tareuil family. His first theft is a
vendetta against the Mon
tareuils and the monied deca
dence they represent to him.
Jean Paul Belmondo, the
French Brando, plays the thief
with elegantly reserved de
meanor and a wry, cynical
humor that underscores the
self-sufficiency, but also the
loneliness, of his obsessive oc
cupation.
One of France's most exciting
actresses appears in the film
with Belmondo. Genevieve
Bujold gives the character of
Charlotte a sensual innocence

which comes off as downright
seductive, though she tends to
curb the part a little too much in
places, giving it a two
dimensional stiffness.
Throughout the first half of the
movie, the pace of the action,
camera motion and scene
changes is slow, almost languid,
creating the ambience of an im
pressionistic painting from the
1890s. It largely works,
nevertheless, and escapes bore
dom, because it accents the
story's droll humor and comic
irony. However, Malle carries
the effect to an extreme and
thereby strains the viewer's at
tention dangerously close to los
ing it. About halfway through
the film, 1 experienced acute but
temporary boredom.
Critics have been more posi
tive: Newsweek praised Bel
mondo's "psychological acuity"
and the film's "dramatic elec
tricity," while the Boston Globe
commented: "it seems almost
astounding that it's so pleasura
ble."
It should appeal to students
who take film seriously, but not
to those who want their hedonis
tic pleasure unadulterated by
mental effort. (Showing at Surf
Theatres, SF, through Feb. 19).

Louis Malle's The Thief of
' Puris, first released in France in
• 1967. captures the intricate set of
; factors which molds a man's
• consuming obsession with his
profession, in this case, the "pro
[ fession" of stealing.
.; Malle forcefully suggests that
) the true value and meaning of
• brigandry lies, for the thief (and
the director), in his absolute
committment to his craft, over
and above all else, including the
woman he loves. The degree to
which we share his judgment
measures the success of the film.
Following his apprenticeship
with Robert Bresson, a French
master of the psychological film,
Malle refined his technique in
two "New Wave" films: Le Feu
Follet (1963) and Viva Maria
(1965).
The Thief of Paris, his third
major film, begins its
philosophical and psychologi

cal inquiries with the thief,
played by Jean Paul Belmondo,
committing a jewel theft, and
then flashes back to the course of
affairs which have brought him
to that point.
His history begins with his
learning, as a young man and the
scion of a wealthy family, that
his lecherous uncle has squan
dered his inheritance while he
was at boarding school and in
the military service. Belmondo
discovers that his intense pas
sion for his cousin, Charlotte,
has been thwarted in his absence
as she has become engaged to a
member of the wealthy Mon
tareuil family. His first theft is a
vendetta against the Mon
tareuils and the monied deca
dence they represent to him.
Jean Paul Belmondo, the
French Brando, plays the thief
with elegantly reserved de
meanor and a wry, cynical
humor that underscores the
self-sufficiency, but also the
loneliness, of his obsessive oc
cupation.
One of France's most exciting
actresses appears in the film
with Belmondo. Genevieve
Bujold gives the character of
Charlotte a sensual innocence

which comes off as downright
seductive, though she tends to
curb the part a little too much in
places, giving it a two
dimensional stiffness.
Throughout the first half of the
movie, the pace of the action,
camera motion and scene
changes is slow, almost languid,
creating the ambience of an im
pressionistic painting from the
1890s. It largely works,
nevertheless, and escapes bore
dom, because it accents the
story's droll humor and comic
irony. However, Malle carries
the effect to an extreme and
thereby strains the viewer's at
tention dangerously close to los
ing it. About halfway through
the film, 1 experienced acute but
temporary boredom.
Critics have been more posi
tive: Newsweek praised Bel
mondo's "psychological acuity"
and the film's "dramatic elec
tricity," while the Boston Globe
commented: "it seems almost
astounding that it's so pleasura
ble."
It should appeal to students
