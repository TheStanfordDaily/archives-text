Billed as "New England's
entry into te realm of bizarre
rock," Split Enz played a two
hour set at the Boarding House
last Friday, which relied as
much on their admittedly
strange appearance as on their
challenging music, which is a
carefully constructed, eclectic
collage of musical styles and tex
tures.
Structurally, their music relies
on frequent time signature
changes, abrupt endings, occa
sional dissonance, and catchy,
powerful riffs that can suddenly
segue into a maudlin vaudevil
lian piano bridge, followed by a
solo on spoons. The carefully
calculated contrasts of these
musical elements are reflected in
the persona of the band itself.
Heavily made up, wearing a
loud, exaggerated wardrobe
which suggested a cross bet
ween a bellboy's uniform and a
thrift shop suit, the band main
tained for the most part an eerie
deadpan, playing deliberately,
occasionally indulging in
campy pantomine and parody
mechanistic choreography. The

dramatic and extensive use of
the Boarding House's limited
lighting equipment effectively
exploited the visual impact of
the band, emphasizing the band
and its music as an artistic
whole.
The set consisted largely of
new material: only four cuts
were included from their first al
bum, Mental Notes, just recently
released stateside on Chrysalis
Records. Live, Split Enz comes
off with a much fuller, more
compelling sound than in the
studio, when their music is often
dominated by acoustic guitar
and piano.
Due to the nature of their
music Split Enz has a limited
appeal—but their
audience should expand beyond
the one that applauded loudly
and appreciatively at the Board
ing House.
The band consists of Tim Finn
on vocals, Philip Judd on guitar,
Edward Rayner on keyboards,
Jonathan Chunn on bass, Noel
Crombie on percussion, with
Robert Gillies doubling on sax
and trumpet and Emlyn
Crowther on drums. They play
original material by Finn and
Judd, which shows the influence
of the London avant-garde (their
album was produced in London
by Phil Manzanera of Roxy
Music).
Formed four years ago as an
entirely acoustic ensemble, they
have toured constantly, develop
ing their act and gaining enough
of a following so that their new
album entered the Australian
charts at the number seven posi
tion.
Split Enz seamed strangely at
home on the stage of the seedy
but comfortable Boarding
House, whose well worn air of

informality extends to its service
(waitresses were noisily taking
orders during the show), but not
to its prices ($5 admission, $1.25
for Mickey's Big Mouth).
There is a catholic selection of
drinks available at your table
(even soft drinks for those un
lucky enough to be under 21)
with hard liquor available at the
bar downstairs. There is also a
"family dining" establishment
downstairs for those who crave
something more substantial.
In sum, a good time is to be
had at the Boarding House,
whose varied and quality
oriented offerings will include
jazzman Nat Adderly who will
be appearing until Feb. 13.


Lily Tomlin, comedienne and social critic, is performing at the
Boarding House (441-4333), 960 Bush St., San Francisco
from Monday, Feb. 14 to Feb. 19.

The set consisted largely of
new material: only four cuts
were included from their first al
bum, Mental Notes, just recently
released stateside on Chrysalis
Records. Live, Split Enz comes
off with a much fuller, more
compelling sound than in the
studio, when their music is often
dominated by acoustic guitar
and piano.
Due to the nature of their
music Split Enz has a limited
appeal—but their
audience should expand beyond
the one that applauded loudly
and appreciatively at the Board
ing House.
The band consists of Tim Finn
on vocals, Philip Judd on guitar,
Edward Rayner on keyboards,
Jonathan Chunn on bass, Noel
Crombie on percussion, with
Robert Gillies doubling on sax
and trumpet and Emlyn
Crowther on drums. They play
original material by Finn and
Judd, which shows the influence
of the London avant-garde (their
album was produced in London
by Phil Manzanera of Roxy
Music).
Formed four years ago as an
entirely acoustic ensemble, they
have toured constantly, develop
ing their act and gaining enough
of a following so that their new
album entered the Australian
charts at the number seven posi
tion.
Split Enz seamed strangely at
home on the stage of the seedy
but comfortable Boarding
House, whose well worn air of

informality extends to its service
(waitresses were noisily taking
orders during the show), but not
to its prices ($5 admission, $1.25
for Mickey's Big Mouth).
There is a catholic selection of
drinks available at your table
(even soft drinks for those un
lucky enough to be under 21)
with hard liquor available at the
bar downstairs. There is also a
"family dining" establishment
downstairs for those who crave
something more substantial.
In sum, a good time is to be
had at the Boarding House,
whose varied and quality
oriented offerings will include
jazzman Nat Adderly who will
be appearing until Feb. 13.


Lily Tomlin, comedienne and social critic, is performing at the
Boarding House (441-4333), 960 Bush St., San Francisco
from Monday, Feb. 14 to Feb. 19.

Billed as "New England's
entry into te realm of bizarre
rock," Split Enz played a two
hour set at the Boarding House
last Friday, which relied as
much on their admittedly
strange appearance as on their
challenging music, which is a
carefully constructed, eclectic
collage of musical styles and tex
tures.
Structurally, their music relies
on frequent time signature
changes, abrupt endings, occa
sional dissonance, and catchy,
powerful riffs that can suddenly
segue into a maudlin vaudevil
lian piano bridge, followed by a
solo on spoons. The carefully
calculated contrasts of these
musical elements are reflected in
the persona of the band itself.
Heavily made up, wearing a
loud, exaggerated wardrobe
which suggested a cross bet
ween a bellboy's uniform and a
thrift shop suit, the band main
tained for the most part an eerie
deadpan, playing deliberately,
occasionally indulging in
campy pantomine and parody
mechanistic choreography. The

dramatic and extensive use of
the Boarding House's limited
lighting equipment effectively
exploited the visual impact of
the band, emphasizing the band
and its music as an artistic
whole.
