# Problem blamed on lack of interest
## Co-op housing: an endangered lifestyle? 
### Pan Demetrakakes News analysis 
Co-op houses may be in trouble here.
The University is preparing to take a
long look at whether co-ops should
survive. The Subcommittee on Resi
dences of the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS/R) will consider co
ops, along with other special priority
houses, at its meeting tonight.
One problem in evaluating co-ops is
deciding what the criteria should be
for keeping them. The most obvious
one, and the most objective, is popu
larity.
"In a time of scarce housing, you
cannot escape dealing with the popu
larity mechanism," said Karen Mur
ray, assistant dean of student affairs.
"We have data that maybe we do have
more spaces in co-ops than demands
for them."
For example, Jordan House now has
six empty spaces, Columbae House
had four that went unfilled until early
this quarter. Synergy House and Terra
House had one apiece which were fil
led only late last quarter.
Popuarlity indicators
However, the number of unfilled
spaces in a house may be more an indi
cator of bureaucratic inflexibility than
of the house's popularity. Jordan's
draw statistics are dismal, but Terra
and Columbae register a strong aver
age, and Synergy's statistics are quite
good: every space in the house could
be filled twice.
"The timing of the assignment pro
cess is such that sometimes you can't
have available all the people who are
interested," Murray said.
However, factors other than popu
larity may figure in the University's
decision.
"Even if it's popular, we might ask:
What contribution to students' educa
tion has living in the house made?"
Murray said.
Tim Ferguson, chairman of COSS/R,

was more blunt: "It's possible that we
would recommend taking away the
special priority of houses that aren't
doing enough to fulfill theiT theme,
even though they may be fairly popu
lar."
Some co-ops might get stuck on that
point. For example. Synergy House
was spawned by Project Synergy, a re
source and counseling center which
folded last June.
"Most of the people involved in Pro
ject Synergy were in some sort of trans
ition themselves — stopping out or
graduating — and it was hard to find
people interested in it who would be
around," said Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Alan Strain, who taught the
SWOPSI course that evolved into Pro
ject Synergy.
Some of the house's attempts to
cooperate with Project Synergy came
to grief.
"We had a 'hotel,' a room
downstairs, for alternative-lifestyle
speakers," said Synergy resident Kate
Swaim. "But we had to drop it because
people would stay for months."
Change in trends
"There's not much support for alter
native lifestyles these days," said
Richard Korry, another Synergy resi
dent. "There used to be, but it changed
— like a lot of other trends."
In fact, when it comes to the appeal
of a co-op for its residents, theme
seems to take second place to a more
human attraction: the camaraderie of a
house run by the people who live
there.
"I feel I know everybody in the
house, and there's always the potential
to know them better," said Synergy re
sident Holly Russell. "It's not at all a
pass-by-night sort of thing."
"It's not like a dorm living situa
tion," said Stacey Greenberg of Col
umbae. "You learn from cooking and
working in the house. The people here
like each other a lot."

Resident Roger Cole called Colum
bae "the backrub capital of Stanford."
Working and cooking in a co-op is
usually done by rotation. Once in a
while, however, it isn't done at all. Last
summer, a county health inspector
wanted to shut down all openjcitchens
on campus, but the University talked
him out of it.
Dirty kitchen
"The kitchen does get dirty,"
Synergy resident Bob Winy.lau admit
ted. "That was a problem that got bad
last year. But we won't have it this
year."
Terra House Associate Ted Nace
said his co-op had the same problem.
"We try to keep the place a lot cleaner

this year than last. For the most part
everything gets done . . . sometimes
not."
If co-ops occasionally get a little
sloppy, it's probably because they are
more like large homes than like dor
mitories.
Most co-op residents seem
attached to their houses and do not
appreciate the imminent scrutiny of
the University. "There are people who
said they'd quit school if the Univer
sity sacked the house." said Swaim.
A decision is expected by March. If
what Swaim says is true, perhaps some
co-op residents had better plan for a
long summer vacation.
