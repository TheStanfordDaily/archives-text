## Volleyball at its best Top ranked UCLA takes on Cards 
### Jill Lieber 
Stanford's Northern California
championship volleyball team
takes on number one ranked
UCLA tonight in Maples Pavil
ion at 7:30 p.m. The Bruins are
five-time defending NCAA
champs and have beaten the
Cards in two outings already this
season.
Collegiate volleyball is domi
nated totally by UCLA and the
Bruins continue to draw top
beach and prep volleyball stars
to the sunny Los Angeles cam
pus. Located in the heart of the
volleyball Mecca, UCLA recruits
and hands out athletic scholar
ships to volleyball players as
readily as it does to its bruising
football stars.
The Cards' head coach Art
Lambert sees the interest in vol
leyball on the upswing on the
Farm.
"Every kid on this campus
plays volleyball behind thefrats,
eating clubs or dorms. Vol
leyball is a sport that, if the in
terest gets started here, I think
it'll really take off.
"It's the world's greatest spec
tator sport. There are more par
ticipants in volleyball around
the world than any other sport."
All-American sport
Volleyball was developed in
the United States and then was
exported to Europe and Asia. La
ter, Latin American countries
picked it up and, right now, La
mbert said he can't think of any
continent that doesn't have at
least two or three good profes
sional volleyball teams.
"The sport lends itself ex
tremely well to television be
cause the camera never has to
move while play is in action. It is
also a very inexpensive sport
which any number of people can
play—from two to a great

number."
Volleyball also takes up little
space but at the present time the
men's team has a facility prob
lem. Every morning the men
work out from 6:30 to 9:30 in
Maples because of the competi
tion for space between men's
and women's basketball as well
as physical education classes.
"I don't want anyone to get the
idea that we are complaining
about the treatment the Athletic
Department is giving us," Lam
bert said. "Joe Ruetz is doing ev
erything he can. He wants a
well-rounded athletic program,
but of course it will be a slow
process."
Two-timing man
The Athletic Department is al
ready coming to grips with the
fact that very soon a full time
volleyball coach will have to be
hired for the team. Presently, Art
Lambert is coaching two sports
at Stanford.
Last fall he was the coach of
Stanford's NCAA championship
waterpolo team. Yesterday,
looking tired and wornout,
Lambert said he wouldn't give
up commands of either team. He
enjoys the thrill of helping an
athlete meet his goals.
"Waterpolo and volleyball are
dissimilar in the sense that one is
played in the water and the other
is played on a floor. But they are
similar in that both take team
work, a tremendous amount of
dedication and discipline and an
enormous amount of effort on

the part of the players.
"Coaching is coaching
though. It means motivating
athletes to reach their potential.
It's always the same in any
sport."
Polo v. volleyball
In volleyball as well as water
polo, players don't hit their po
tential until age 25 or 26. A lot of
players finish out their careers in
college and then play in pick-up
games on the beach. Others go
on to join club teams.
"Both sports require a con
stant amount of attention and
practice," Lambert pointed out.
"in the Socialist countries espe
cially, their teams are hard to
beat because they've got the
facilities and the guys work out
continually."
Last year Stanford's volleyball
team had the status of varsity
club and this season the team is a
full varsity sport. Presently, four
of the Pac-8 conference schools
are playing volleyball
intercollegiately—UCLA, USC,
Cal and Stanford. Lambert hopes
that gradually the other schools
in the conference, along with
Arizona and Arizona State, will
join the conference to make the
sport a full Pac-8 (or Pac-10)
sport.
"There is a tremendous
amount of improvement bet
ween last year's opponents and
this season's," Lambert said.
"Last year we played mostly
against clubs which meant that
the players could be under

graduates as well as grad stu
dents. Now most of the teams are
fully undergrads, so we can see
how well we match-up against
them."
And how will the Cards, now
1 -2 on the season, match-up with
the UCLA powerhouse?
"I don't think we'll match
them in experience, blocking or
defense. We'll come close in
serving though. We've got two
players, Tom Duralde and Andy
Fishburn, who could play on
their team."
But don't get the idea that
Lambert is shaking in his boots
at the thought of the big, bad
Bruins' invasion of Maples to
night. The above statement is
just a psych-out tactic.
He's prepared his Card forces
well.
He's installed a new offense.
He's taken the team up to San
Francisco to scrimmage the
Olympic Club, the top club team
in the area.
And he's got his pep talk be
fore the match all thought out.
"Score more points," Lambert
said with a chuckle. "I'm going
to tell them to score more points
than UCLA.
"We've played UCLA twice
this season and the second meet
ing we played much better. The
awe of playing them has worn
off. We're going to give it all
we've got. We've worked very
hard for this match. We know to
be the best, we have to beat the
best."
