# Beavers dam Card cagers
## 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford basketball coach
Dick Dißiaso almost lost his cool
after the Cards lost their second
straight contest to Oregon State,
76-75, last night.
Cardinal guard Mike Bratz,
who led Stanford with 26 points,
drove the key for a lay-in to bring
the Cards to within one point of
the second-place Beavers with
just five seconds remaining,
76-75. But referee Frank Buc
kiewitz didn't start a five-second
count on the inbounds pass.
Under a heavy Card press,
OSU didn't inbound the ball
with the regulation five seconds.
But Buckiewitz, a veteran
Pacific-8 official, forgot all about
the five-second rule and OSU
guard George "Ice-T" Tucker
just held onto the ball after the
Beavers finally put the ball in
play.

Card assistant Tom
McLaughlin had to restrain Di-
Biaso after the game, because the
second-year coach wanted to go
after Buckiewitz.
"The ball should have been
dead when it went into the
stands," said Dißiaso, "and ob
viously I thought there should
have been a five-second count."
Beaver guard Rocky Smith,
who always plays well against
Stanford, was a one-man show.
Smith scored 16 points in the
first half to give the Beavers a
40-35 lead at intermission.
Smith finished the contest with
28 points.
OSU opened up a 70-62 lead
with 3:40 left in the contest as
Smith and his backcourt mate
Tucker went wild.
The Cards didn't just attack
the Beaver zone in the final three
minutes of the contest. They de
cimated it.

Bratz hit two jumpers to close
the gap to four, 70-66. Then
freshman forward Kimberly Bel
ton, who had an excellent sec
ond half, scoring 11 points (16 in
thecontest), stoletheball and hit
Bratz, to narrow the gap to two
points.
But the Cards were still in
trouble. Tucker, who had 14
points and 10 assists, hit two free
throws to give the Beavers a
72-68 lead.
Bratz hit another jumper to
close the gap to two again, but he
fouled OSU forward Rickey Lee
on the following play. The game
looked out of reach when Lee hit
two free throws to give the Beav
ers a 74-70 lead, with 1:06 left.
Oregon State freshman center
Steve Johnson, who had fouled
out of 13 of 22 games this year,
decided to keep his record in
tact. Johnson fouled Bratz and
then went after the officials.
He was assessed a technical
and Bratz hit all three free
throws, to narrow the gap to one
— 74-73 with 43 seconds left.
But Stanford couldn't get a
good shot off.
Instead reserve forward Mark
Fitzner threw the ball away
when he tried to get the ball in
side to freshman center Tom
Schmalzried.
But then the officials forgot
how to count to five.
