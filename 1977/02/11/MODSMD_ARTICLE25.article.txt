# Hi, Naber
## Card swimmers host powerhouse USC 
### Julie Fiedler 
Jim McKay ought to be on
hand Saturday when the Card
swimmers take on USC. With
eight Montreal Olympians com
peting, the Pac.-8 dual match is
almost a mini-Olympics.
The big name Saturday — John
Naber. You remember John —
America's hero during that last
week in July. In breaking four
world records, Nabor collected
gold medals in the 100 and 200
back, the 400 medley and 800
free relays, and a silver medal in
the 200 free. The senior from
Menlo Park is the winner of eight
NCAA titles and with a strong
performance in 1977 National
competition, he has the chance
to break the record of nine career
titles held by Jack Medica of
Washington and Roy Saari of
USC.
National champions for three

years, the Trojan squad is likely
to repeat its title. USC has not
lost a dual, conference or AAU
meet over the last three seasons
and with the strength of this
year's squad, is not likely to lose
for a long while.
Other Olympians on the Tro
jan team are Bruce Furniss (two
golds — 200 free and 800 free
relay), Rod Strachan (gold in4oo
IM) and Joe Bottom (silver in 100
fly).
Recruited from Canada are
Olympians Steve Pickell (silver
in 100 medley relay-fly leg) and
Mike Ker.
With such an introduction of
the opposing team, one should
be careful not to forget the host
team. Stanford boasts two
Olympians, sophomore Mike
Bruner and freshman Paul Hart
loff. as well as several top na
tional competitors.

Both coaches Jim Gaughran
and Debbie Meyer are optimistic
about Stanford's performance
against USC.
"We've been swimming some
incredible times this week," says
Meyer. "Bruner swam a 400 but
terfly (not an official event) in
record time after just a few mi
nutes of warm-up. Also both
Billy Chao and Tom O'Brien
pushed off a 4:09 in the4oo indi
vidual medley."
Qualifying time for the Na
tionals is 4;08.1.
"We expect the meet to be
much closer than last Saturday,"
says Gaughran. Although three
pool records were broken by
Stanford swimmers, the Cards
fell to UCLA, 77-36.
Gaughran cites a common
problem in competing against
both teams from the sunny
South. "It's a question of depth,"
he said. "Even when we take
firsts, we still need to get second
and third place points."
One exciting match-up will be

in the freestyle sprint events.
Stanford's Dave Fairbank and
SC's Joe Bottom are long time
lane rivals. For the past three
years, Fairbank has beaten
the 6'4" Trojan senior in dual
meets, but then has lost to Bot
tom in the NCAA's.
"Bottom is not a natural
swimmer like Fairbank," says
coach Meyer. "Dave has a spe
cial quality stroke and the right
body build. . .Bottom relies on
pure guts."
Stanford junior Stu Corliss
should handily take the breast
stroke events. Having made qual
ifying time last week, Corliss
will shine in USC's weakest area.
Another expected point win
ning area for the Cards will be in
the diving competition.
Freshman Mike Ray, who has
been the higher scorer all season,
will be backed by seniors Wayne
Wager and Tom Pedreira and
junior Steve Powell.
The meet is scheduled to
begin at 1 p.m. at deGuerre Pool.
