# Mike Bratz:
## A 						far cry from the dugout 
### Jill Lieber 
For a guy who always wanted to be a pro
baseball player when he was growing up,
Stanford guard Mike Bratz sometimes
stands back in wonderment as to how he
ever got to be the third leading scorer in the
Pac-8 and the number one scoring guard,
"1 didn't start playing basketball until 1
was in seventh grade. 1 hadn't even consi
dered basketball before then. We had a hoop
in the backyard but that was just for mes
sing around with my brother.
"All my idols were pro baseball players
and 1 wanted to be a pro basebal 1 player, too.
I played baseball in all my spare time until 1
had a lot of arm problems in high school.
Then senior year I started dedicating myself
to basketball. Before that it was secondary.
But now basketball is where it's at."
Where it's at
Bratz has scored 18 or more points in 14>
games this season including 25 points on
two occasions. Before going scoreless at
Oregon he had an 11-game string of scoring
over 18 points.
The spark of Stanford's offense, his
quickness and ball handling techniques
have allowed him to emerge as one of the
premier guards on the West Coast.
"Mike has proved to be the heartbeat of
both our offense and defense," said coach
Dick Dißiaso. "He contributes both leader
ship and consistency to the team.
"He is playing with confidence and is
very certain of his abilities and as a result is
very assertive."
"Now that I'm a senior 1 feel more respon
sibility to the team than I did last year,"
Bratz said. "I was the team's quarterback
last season and continue to be this year. But
this year when I make mistakes they stick
out more."
New kid in town
Bratz transferred to Stanford for his
sophomore year after starring on the 1974
championship junior college team of Allan
Hancock College. He played with Rich Kel
ley, now a member of the New Orleans Jazz
pro basketball team, his first season here.
Last year he played with one of the top
California forwards, Ed Schweitzer.
Bratz has always been overshadowed
while on the Farm, but this year he has

become the man to get—to supress the
Cardinal attack or tor interviews and locker
room quotes.
"There haven t been too many more in
terviews than last year," he said. "There has
been more publicity."
"You know, sometimes it's hard to
evaluate the game when reporters come up
to me in the locker room right after we've
finished playing. I have been involved in
the game and can evaluate my own play, but
it's hard to talk about the total play of
everyone. The reporters should ask coach
Dißiaso that."
Shut up
Bratz was shut down by the Oregon de
fense last week and held scoreless. He put
up only three shots against the Ducks and
fouled out with most of the second half re
maining.
"As far as one team concentrating solely
on me and shutting me off that hasn't really
happened," Bratz said. Then he paused and
burst out laughing.
"Well, I guess they have," he went on.
"The game against Oregon was the most
frustrating thing that ever happened to me
in my life.
"Those last four foul shots were ques
tionable," Bratz said, acknowledging he
thinks the officials were riding him particu
larly and unnecessarily hard.
"But I've gotten away with a lot before, so
I guess it all evens out," he said.
Great guns
The next night against Oregon State in
Corvallis, Bratz came back to score 24
points, but that wasn't enough, as the Cards
lost to the Beavers, 71-61.
"It wasn't hard for me to come back for
the game with Oregon State," he said. "I
was the only guy on the team who was re
sted.
"Against Oregon State, I decided to let
things happen more and not force them as I
had the night before. Their players (OSU's)
have different talents from Oregon's."
Aggressive on the court, Bratz is quiet
and reserved off the court A sensitive per
son, his simple small town values are not
easily disguised.
Bratz is from Lompoc, Calif., a town of
about 25.000 people located near Vanden

burg Air Force Base, 150 miles south of Los
Angeles.
Family and friends are an important part
of Bratz' life. He has put several profes
sional sportswriters off when long-time
buddies drop in. After the Stanford game
against Hawaii for example, Bratz insisted
upon talking to his parents who had driven
four and a half hours that afternoon to see
him play — before he spoke to reporters.
"This is more important," he said walk
ing past a Chronicle reporter. "I've got to
talk to my parents first."
Once done discussing the game, school
or the next day's activities, Bratz scooted up
to the press box on his own accord. It is oh,
so rare for an athlete to be "considerate" to
the press and newspaper deadlines.
Coverage unimportant
"Mike is a very sensitive guy," said assis
tant coach Bob Frederick "At times it seems
like he avoids reporters and people could
get the idea he's got a big head. But he's just
shy. Gee, how could you have a big head
when you're 9-10 on the season?"
"He's got simple values," said Sports In
formation Director Gary Cavalli, who ar
ranges athletes' interviews with the media.
"It doesn't mean a lot to him to see his name
and a few words in print. That's refresh
ing."
Bratz is one of the biggest things to hap
pen to Lompoc.
"People are proud of what I've done," he
said. "I'm the only person in the last 10
years to play a major college sport from
Lompoc."
Country boy
Bratz' down home attitude is seen out
wardly at first glance.
Often times Oshkosh B'Gosh overalls
peek out from behind his unbuttoned Stan
ford varsity letter jacket.
But the dead giveaway is his "infamous"
maroon Nova. The car, jacked up in the
back, sports slick, wide Dunlop 70 tires.
Kinda conjures up the notion of cruising the
avenue on Saturday night, don't it?
Before games Bratz has been known to be
sick to his stomach. The responsibility of
being the team leader — holding it all to
gether — causes his nervous stomach.

Running up a tremendous number of
points in a game, Bratz has never felt like he
is the whole team — like he has to do it all.
"If I didn't have the other four guys out
there with me," he said, "I'd be nowhere. In
games where I have scored a lot of points,
they set me up with good screens on offense
and great backdoor passes. I'm not the type
of player to do it all by myself.
"I've been fortunate not to get hurt this
year. I try to play my best every night. I want
to do as much as I can, but not do every
thing."
Bratz said this season has been a disap
pointment. The Cards are 1-6 in Pac-8 play,
having beaten only USC way back on Jan.
13. The Cards have lost eight of their last
ten games.
Tough luck
"We could've done a lot this year but we
had a lot of problems. Even coach Dißiaso
says we're not the same team we were in
December. Our personnel is different.
We've had tough breaks. January was a big
disappointment.
"Before the season started I didn't set
numerical goals. 1 had no idea I'd be scoring
so many points. We were all skeptical what
would happen when Ceorge (Schader) got
hurt. But I really thought we'd do better in
the Pac-8, though."
Unfulfilled
Bratz said all the points in the world
couldn't ever make up for the fact the team
isn't winning.
"My scoring 25 points this year has not
made any more of a difference than say last
year when I scored 12 points in a game.
We're still not winning. I've got an unfulfil
led feeling even though I am scoring a lot of
points."
The lone senior on the team, Bratz is al
ready preparing himself for the shock of his
college basketbal 1 career coming to an end.
"I have only one month left," he said.
"It'll be a big letdown to play my last game
at Stanford — it'll probably all hit me at
once.
"It would've been fun to play with Wolfe
and George and Kim Belton this year. It's
really too bad it didn't work out."

the press and newspaper deadlines.
Coverage unimportant
"Mike is a very sensitive guy," said assis
tant coach Bob Frederick "At times it seems
like he avoids reporters and people could
get the idea he's got a big head. But he's just
shy. Gee, how could you have a big head
when you're 9-10 on the season?"
"He's got simple values," said Sports In
formation Director Gary Cavalli, who ar
ranges athletes' interviews with the media.
"It doesn't mean a lot to him to see his name
and a few words in print. That's refresh
ing."
Bratz is one of the biggest things to hap
pen to Lompoc.
"People are proud of what I've done," he
said. "I'm the only person in the last 10
years to play a major college sport from

Country boy
Bratz' down home attitude is seen out
wardly at first glance.
Often times Oshkosh B'Gosh overalls
peek out from behind his unbuttoned Stan

But the dead giveaway is his "infamous"
maroon Nova. The car, jacked up in the
back, sports slick, wide Dunlop 70 tires.
Kinda conjures up the notion of cruising the
avenue on Saturday night, don't it?
Before games Bratz has been known to be
sick to his stomach. The responsibility of
being the team leader — holding it all to
gether — causes his nervous stomach.

Running up a tremendous number of
points in a game, Bratz has never felt like he
is the whole team — like he has to do it all.
"If I didn't have the other four guys out
there with me," he said, "I'd be nowhere. In
games where I have scored a lot of points,
they set me up with good screens on offense
and great backdoor passes. I'm not the type
of player to do it all by myself.
"I've been fortunate not to get hurt this
year. I try to play my best every night. I want
to do as much as I can, but not do every
thing."
Bratz said this season has been a disap
pointment. The Cards are 1-6 in Pac-8 play,
having beaten only USC way back on Jan.
13. The Cards have lost eight of their last
ten games.
Tough luck
"We could've done a lot this year but we
had a lot of problems. Even coach Dißiaso
says we're not the same team we were in
December. Our personnel is different.
We've had tough breaks. January was a big
disappointment.
"Before the season started I didn't set
numerical goals. 1 had no idea I'd be scoring
so many points. We were all skeptical what
would happen when Ceorge (Schader) got
hurt. But I really thought we'd do better in
the Pac-8, though."
Unfulfilled
Bratz said all the points in the world
couldn't ever make up for the fact the team
isn't winning.
"My scoring 25 points this year has not
made any more of a difference than say last
year when I scored 12 points in a game.
We're still not winning. I've got an unfulfil
led feeling even though I am scoring a lot of
points."
The lone senior on the team, Bratz is al
ready preparing himself for the shock of his
college basketbal 1 career coming to an end.
"I have only one month left," he said.
"It'll be a big letdown to play my last game
at Stanford — it'll probably all hit me at
once.
"It would've been fun to play with Wolfe
and George and Kim Belton this year. It's
really too bad it didn't work out."

For a guy who always wanted to be a pro
baseball player when he was growing up,
Stanford guard Mike Bratz sometimes
stands back in wonderment as to how he
ever got to be the third leading scorer in the
Pac-8 and the number one scoring guard,
"1 didn't start playing basketball until 1
was in seventh grade. 1 hadn't even consi
dered basketball before then. We had a hoop
in the backyard but that was just for mes
sing around with my brother.
"All my idols were pro baseball players
and 1 wanted to be a pro basebal 1 player, too.
I played baseball in all my spare time until 1
had a lot of arm problems in high school.
Then senior year I started dedicating myself
to basketball. Before that it was secondary.
But now basketball is where it's at."
Where it's at
Bratz has scored 18 or more points in 14>
games this season including 25 points on
two occasions. Before going scoreless at
Oregon he had an 11-game string of scoring
over 18 points.
The spark of Stanford's offense, his
quickness and ball handling techniques
have allowed him to emerge as one of the
premier guards on the West Coast.
"Mike has proved to be the heartbeat of
both our offense and defense," said coach
Dick Dißiaso. "He contributes both leader
ship and consistency to the team.
"He is playing with confidence and is
very certain of his abilities and as a result is
very assertive."
"Now that I'm a senior 1 feel more respon
sibility to the team than I did last year,"
Bratz said. "I was the team's quarterback
last season and continue to be this year. But
this year when I make mistakes they stick
out more."
New kid in town
Bratz transferred to Stanford for his
sophomore year after starring on the 1974
championship junior college team of Allan
Hancock College. He played with Rich Kel
ley, now a member of the New Orleans Jazz
pro basketball team, his first season here.
Last year he played with one of the top
California forwards, Ed Schweitzer.
Bratz has always been overshadowed
while on the Farm, but this year he has

become the man to get—to supress the
Cardinal attack or tor interviews and locker
room quotes.
"There haven t been too many more in
terviews than last year," he said. "There has
been more publicity."
"You know, sometimes it's hard to
evaluate the game when reporters come up
to me in the locker room right after we've
finished playing. I have been involved in
the game and can evaluate my own play, but
it's hard to talk about the total play of
everyone. The reporters should ask coach
Dißiaso that."
Shut up
Bratz was shut down by the Oregon de
fense last week and held scoreless. He put
up only three shots against the Ducks and
fouled out with most of the second half re
maining.
"As far as one team concentrating solely
on me and shutting me off that hasn't really
happened," Bratz said. Then he paused and
burst out laughing.
"Well, I guess they have," he went on.
"The game against Oregon was the most
frustrating thing that ever happened to me
in my life.
"Those last four foul shots were ques
tionable," Bratz said, acknowledging he
thinks the officials were riding him particu
larly and unnecessarily hard.
"But I've gotten away with a lot before, so
I guess it all evens out," he said.
Great guns
The next night against Oregon State in
Corvallis, Bratz came back to score 24
points, but that wasn't enough, as the Cards
lost to the Beavers, 71-61.
"It wasn't hard for me to come back for
the game with Oregon State," he said. "I
was the only guy on the team who was re
sted.
"Against Oregon State, I decided to let
things happen more and not force them as I
had the night before. Their players (OSU's)
have different talents from Oregon's."
Aggressive on the court, Bratz is quiet
and reserved off the court A sensitive per
son, his simple small town values are not
easily disguised.
Bratz is from Lompoc, Calif., a town of
about 25.000 people located near Vanden

burg Air Force Base, 150 miles south of Los
Angeles.
Family and friends are an important part
of Bratz' life. He has put several profes
sional sportswriters off when long-time
buddies drop in. After the Stanford game
against Hawaii for example, Bratz insisted
upon talking to his parents who had driven
four and a half hours that afternoon to see
him play — before he spoke to reporters.
"This is more important," he said walk
ing past a Chronicle reporter. "I've got to
talk to my parents first."
Once done discussing the game, school
or the next day's activities, Bratz scooted up
to the press box on his own accord. It is oh,
so rare for an athlete to be "considerate" to
the press and newspaper deadlines.
Coverage unimportant
"Mike is a very sensitive guy," said assis
tant coach Bob Frederick "At times it seems

both our offense and defense," said coach
Dick Dißiaso. "He contributes both leader
ship and consistency to the team.
"He is playing with confidence and is
very certain of his abilities and as a result is
very assertive."
"Now that I'm a senior 1 feel more respon
sibility to the team than I did last year,"
Bratz said. "I was the team's quarterback
last season and continue to be this year. But
this year when I make mistakes they stick
out more."
New kid in town
Bratz transferred to Stanford for his
sophomore year after starring on the 1974
championship junior college team of Allan
Hancock College. He played with Rich Kel
ley, now a member of the New Orleans Jazz
pro basketball team, his first season here.
Last year he played with one of the top
California forwards, Ed Schweitzer.
Bratz has always been overshadowed
while on the Farm, but this year he has

become the man to get—to supress the
Cardinal attack or tor interviews and locker
room quotes.
"There haven t been too many more in
terviews than last year," he said. "There has
been more publicity."
"You know, sometimes it's hard to
evaluate the game when reporters come up
to me in the locker room right after we've
finished playing. I have been involved in
the game and can evaluate my own play, but
it's hard to talk about the total play of
everyone. The reporters should ask coach
Dißiaso that."
Shut up
Bratz was shut down by the Oregon de
fense last week and held scoreless. He put
up only three shots against the Ducks and
fouled out with most of the second half re
maining.
"As far as one team concentrating solely
on me and shutting me off that hasn't really
happened," Bratz said. Then he paused and
burst out laughing.
"Well, I guess they have," he went on.
"The game against Oregon was the most
frustrating thing that ever happened to me
in my life.
"Those last four foul shots were ques
tionable," Bratz said, acknowledging he
thinks the officials were riding him particu
larly and unnecessarily hard.
"But I've gotten away with a lot before, so
I guess it all evens out," he said.
Great guns
The next night against Oregon State in
Corvallis, Bratz came back to score 24
points, but that wasn't enough, as the Cards
lost to the Beavers, 71-61.
"It wasn't hard for me to come back for
the game with Oregon State," he said. "I
was the only guy on the team who was re
sted.
"Against Oregon State, I decided to let
things happen more and not force them as I
had the night before. Their players (OSU's)
have different talents from Oregon's."
Aggressive on the court, Bratz is quiet
and reserved off the court A sensitive per
son, his simple small town values are not
easily disguised.
Bratz is from Lompoc, Calif., a town of
about 25.000 people located near Vanden

burg Air Force Base, 150 miles south of Los
Angeles.
Family and friends are an important part
of Bratz' life. He has put several profes
sional sportswriters off when long-time
buddies drop in. After the Stanford game
against Hawaii for example, Bratz insisted
upon talking to his parents who had driven
four and a half hours that afternoon to see
him play — before he spoke to reporters.
"This is more important," he said walk
ing past a Chronicle reporter. "I've got to
talk to my parents first."
Once done discussing the game, school
or the next day's activities, Bratz scooted up
to the press box on his own accord. It is oh,
so rare for an athlete to be "considerate" to
the press and newspaper deadlines.
Coverage unimportant
"Mike is a very sensitive guy," said assis
tant coach Bob Frederick "At times it seems
like he avoids reporters and people could
get the idea he's got a big head. But he's just
shy. Gee, how could you have a big head
when you're 9-10 on the season?"
"He's got simple values," said Sports In
formation Director Gary Cavalli, who ar
ranges athletes' interviews with the media.
"It doesn't mean a lot to him to see his name
and a few words in print. That's refresh
ing."
Bratz is one of the biggest things to hap
pen to Lompoc.
"People are proud of what I've done," he
said. "I'm the only person in the last 10
years to play a major college sport from
Lompoc."
Country boy
Bratz' down home attitude is seen out
wardly at first glance.
Often times Oshkosh B'Gosh overalls
peek out from behind his unbuttoned Stan
ford varsity letter jacket.
But the dead giveaway is his "infamous"
maroon Nova. The car, jacked up in the
back, sports slick, wide Dunlop 70 tires.
Kinda conjures up the notion of cruising the
avenue on Saturday night, don't it?
Before games Bratz has been known to be
sick to his stomach. The responsibility of
being the team leader — holding it all to
gether — causes his nervous stomach.

Running up a tremendous number of
points in a game, Bratz has never felt like he
is the whole team — like he has to do it all.
"If I didn't have the other four guys out
there with me," he said, "I'd be nowhere. In
games where I have scored a lot of points,
they set me up with good screens on offense
and great backdoor passes. I'm not the type
of player to do it all by myself.
"I've been fortunate not to get hurt this
year. I try to play my best every night. I want
to do as much as I can, but not do every
thing."
Bratz said this season has been a disap
pointment. The Cards are 1-6 in Pac-8 play,
having beaten only USC way back on Jan.
13. The Cards have lost eight of their last
ten games.
Tough luck
"We could've done a lot this year but we
had a lot of problems. Even coach Dißiaso
says we're not the same team we were in
December. Our personnel is different.
We've had tough breaks. January was a big
disappointment.
"Before the season started I didn't set
numerical goals. 1 had no idea I'd be scoring
so many points. We were all skeptical what
would happen when Ceorge (Schader) got
hurt. But I really thought we'd do better in
the Pac-8, though."
Unfulfilled
Bratz said all the points in the world
couldn't ever make up for the fact the team
isn't winning.
"My scoring 25 points this year has not
made any more of a difference than say last
year when I scored 12 points in a game.
We're still not winning. I've got an unfulfil
led feeling even though I am scoring a lot of
points."
The lone senior on the team, Bratz is al
ready preparing himself for the shock of his
college basketbal 1 career coming to an end.
"I have only one month left," he said.
"It'll be a big letdown to play my last game
at Stanford — it'll probably all hit me at
once.
"It would've been fun to play with Wolfe
and George and Kim Belton this year. It's
really too bad it didn't work out."

For a guy who always wanted to be a pro
baseball player when he was growing up,
Stanford guard Mike Bratz sometimes
stands back in wonderment as to how he
ever got to be the third leading scorer in the
Pac-8 and the number one scoring guard,
"1 didn't start playing basketball until 1
was in seventh grade. 1 hadn't even consi
dered basketball before then. We had a hoop
in the backyard but that was just for mes
sing around with my brother.
"All my idols were pro baseball players
and 1 wanted to be a pro basebal 1 player, too.
I played baseball in all my spare time until 1
had a lot of arm problems in high school.
Then senior year I started dedicating myself
to basketball. Before that it was secondary.
But now basketball is where it's at."
Where it's at
Bratz has scored 18 or more points in 14>
games this season including 25 points on
two occasions. Before going scoreless at
Oregon he had an 11-game string of scoring
over 18 points.
The spark of Stanford's offense, his
quickness and ball handling techniques
have allowed him to emerge as one of the
premier guards on the West Coast.
"Mike has proved to be the heartbeat of
both our offense and defense," said coach
Dick Dißiaso. "He contributes both leader
ship and consistency to the team.
"He is playing with confidence and is

Before games Bratz has been known to be
sick to his stomach. The responsibility of
being the team leader — holding it all to
gether — causes his nervous stomach.

Running up a tremendous number of
points in a game, Bratz has never felt like he
is the whole team — like he has to do it all.
"If I didn't have the other four guys out
there with me," he said, "I'd be nowhere. In
games where I have scored a lot of points,
they set me up with good screens on offense
and great backdoor passes. I'm not the type
of player to do it all by myself.
"I've been fortunate not to get hurt this
year. I try to play my best every night. I want
to do as much as I can, but not do every
thing."
Bratz said this season has been a disap
pointment. The Cards are 1-6 in Pac-8 play,
having beaten only USC way back on Jan.
13. The Cards have lost eight of their last
ten games.
Tough luck
"We could've done a lot this year but we
had a lot of problems. Even coach Dißiaso
says we're not the same team we were in
December. Our personnel is different.
We've had tough breaks. January was a big
disappointment.
"Before the season started I didn't set
numerical goals. 1 had no idea I'd be scoring
so many points. We were all skeptical what
would happen when Ceorge (Schader) got
hurt. But I really thought we'd do better in
the Pac-8, though."
Unfulfilled
Bratz said all the points in the world
couldn't ever make up for the fact the team
isn't winning.
"My scoring 25 points this year has not
made any more of a difference than say last
year when I scored 12 points in a game.
We're still not winning. I've got an unfulfil
led feeling even though I am scoring a lot of
points."
The lone senior on the team, Bratz is al
ready preparing himself for the shock of his
college basketbal 1 career coming to an end.
"I have only one month left," he said.
"It'll be a big letdown to play my last game
at Stanford — it'll probably all hit me at
once.
"It would've been fun to play with Wolfe
and George and Kim Belton this year. It's
really too bad it didn't work out."

For a guy who always wanted to be a pro
baseball player when he was growing up,
Stanford guard Mike Bratz sometimes
stands back in wonderment as to how he
ever got to be the third leading scorer in the
Pac-8 and the number one scoring guard,
"1 didn't start playing basketball until 1
was in seventh grade. 1 hadn't even consi
dered basketball before then. We had a hoop
in the backyard but that was just for mes
sing around with my brother.
"All my idols were pro baseball players
and 1 wanted to be a pro basebal 1 player, too.
I played baseball in all my spare time until 1
had a lot of arm problems in high school.
Then senior year I started dedicating myself
to basketball. Before that it was secondary.
But now basketball is where it's at."
Where it's at
Bratz has scored 18 or more points in 14>
games this season including 25 points on
two occasions. Before going scoreless at
Oregon he had an 11-game string of scoring
over 18 points.
The spark of Stanford's offense, his
quickness and ball handling techniques
have allowed him to emerge as one of the
premier guards on the West Coast.
"Mike has proved to be the heartbeat of
both our offense and defense," said coach
Dick Dißiaso. "He contributes both leader
ship and consistency to the team.
"He is playing with confidence and is
very certain of his abilities and as a result is
very assertive."
"Now that I'm a senior 1 feel more respon
sibility to the team than I did last year,"
Bratz said. "I was the team's quarterback
last season and continue to be this year. But
this year when I make mistakes they stick
out more."
New kid in town
Bratz transferred to Stanford for his
sophomore year after starring on the 1974
championship junior college team of Allan
Hancock College. He played with Rich Kel
ley, now a member of the New Orleans Jazz
pro basketball team, his first season here.
Last year he played with one of the top
California forwards, Ed Schweitzer.
Bratz has always been overshadowed
while on the Farm, but this year he has

become the man to get—to supress the
Cardinal attack or tor interviews and locker
room quotes.
"There haven t been too many more in
terviews than last year," he said. "There has
been more publicity."
"You know, sometimes it's hard to
evaluate the game when reporters come up
to me in the locker room right after we've
finished playing. I have been involved in
the game and can evaluate my own play, but
it's hard to talk about the total play of
everyone. The reporters should ask coach
Dißiaso that."
Shut up
Bratz was shut down by the Oregon de
fense last week and held scoreless. He put
up only three shots against the Ducks and
fouled out with most of the second half re
maining.
"As far as one team concentrating solely
on me and shutting me off that hasn't really
happened," Bratz said. Then he paused and
burst out laughing.
"Well, I guess they have," he went on.
"The game against Oregon was the most
frustrating thing that ever happened to me
in my life.
"Those last four foul shots were ques
tionable," Bratz said, acknowledging he
thinks the officials were riding him particu
larly and unnecessarily hard.
"But I've gotten away with a lot before, so
I guess it all evens out," he said.
Great guns
The next night against Oregon State in
Corvallis, Bratz came back to score 24
points, but that wasn't enough, as the Cards
lost to the Beavers, 71-61.
"It wasn't hard for me to come back for
the game with Oregon State," he said. "I
was the only guy on the team who was re
sted.
"Against Oregon State, I decided to let
things happen more and not force them as I
had the night before. Their players (OSU's)
have different talents from Oregon's."
Aggressive on the court, Bratz is quiet
and reserved off the court A sensitive per
son, his simple small town values are not
easily disguised.
Bratz is from Lompoc, Calif., a town of
about 25.000 people located near Vanden

burg Air Force Base, 150 miles south of Los
Angeles.
Family and friends are an important part
of Bratz' life. He has put several profes
sional sportswriters off when long-time
buddies drop in. After the Stanford game
against Hawaii for example, Bratz insisted
upon talking to his parents who had driven
four and a half hours that afternoon to see
him play — before he spoke to reporters.
"This is more important," he said walk
ing past a Chronicle reporter. "I've got to
talk to my parents first."
Once done discussing the game, school
or the next day's activities, Bratz scooted up
to the press box on his own accord. It is oh,
so rare for an athlete to be "considerate" to
the press and newspaper deadlines.
Coverage unimportant
"Mike is a very sensitive guy," said assis
tant coach Bob Frederick "At times it seems
like he avoids reporters and people could
get the idea he's got a big head. But he's just
shy. Gee, how could you have a big head
when you're 9-10 on the season?"
"He's got simple values," said Sports In
formation Director Gary Cavalli, who ar
ranges athletes' interviews with the media.
"It doesn't mean a lot to him to see his name
and a few words in print. That's refresh
ing."
Bratz is one of the biggest things to hap
pen to Lompoc.
"People are proud of what I've done," he
said. "I'm the only person in the last 10
years to play a major college sport from
Lompoc."
Country boy
Bratz' down home attitude is seen out
wardly at first glance.
Often times Oshkosh B'Gosh overalls
peek out from behind his unbuttoned Stan
ford varsity letter jacket.
But the dead giveaway is his "infamous"
maroon Nova. The car, jacked up in the
back, sports slick, wide Dunlop 70 tires.
Kinda conjures up the notion of cruising the
avenue on Saturday night, don't it?
Before games Bratz has been known to be
