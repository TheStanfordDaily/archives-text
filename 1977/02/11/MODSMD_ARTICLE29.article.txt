Vance asks for Rhodesian boycott
Washington — Appealing to Congress to im
pose a boycott against Rhodesian chrome, Sec
retary of State Cyrus Vance said yesterday the
Carter administration supports a rapid but peace
ful transition to black rule in Rhodesia.
"The key to peace lies in Mr. Lan Smith's
hands," Vance said, referring to the white
Rhodesian leader. Vance went on to say that a
U.S. boycott of Rhodesian chrome would per
suade Smith to move in that direction.
Vance, testifying before the Senate Subcom
mittee on African Affairs, said the United States
would not take charge of any negotiations look
ing toward black rule and has no intention of
becoming involved in a conflict in Rhodesia if
Britain fails to arrange a peaceful settlement.
The United Nations has imposed a global
boycott of Rhodesian chrome since 1966. How
ever, the United States has refused to honor the
boycott because of the congressionally imposed
Byrd amendment, which bars U.S. participation.
Vance and Julius Katz, assistant secretary for
economic and business affairs, urged repeal of
the Byrd amendment and offered assurances that
repeal would impose no economic hardships on
the United States, although the price of chrome
might increase slightly.
Marin could get water transfer
Oakland — A tentative agreement to supply
Marin County with water that would normally be
sent to Southern California was reached yester
day.
Robin Reynolds, a deputy director of the
California Department of Water Resources in
Sacramento, described the plan as sort of a swap,
although Marin County will have to pay a yet
unknown sum for the trouble.

Under the plan, the Southern California Met
ropolitan Water District is agreeing to relinquish
300,000 to 400,000 acre feet of Northern Califor
nia water it normally gets from the California
Water Project.
This water will be left in Northern California,
and Reynolds said Marin County would get six to
10 million gallons of it.
Marin County's water would be processed by
the Contra Costa and East Bay water agencies,
and pumped through a pipeline to be built across
the San Rafael bridge — or perhaps make the trip
in barges.
The Southern California district will make up
for its lack of Northern California water by taking
another 300,000 to 400,000 acre feet from the
Colorado River, Reynolds said.
Catholics denounce apartheid
Pretoria, South Africa — The Roman Catholic
Church, in a stiff, new challenge to the govern
ment of white-ruled South Africa, yesterday de
nounced the nation's "social and political system
of oppression."
A statement by the Catholic bishops of south
ern Africa called for sweeping change to avert
more bloodshed.
It urged a sharing of power between South
Africa's 4.5 million whites and its 18 million
voteless blacks, condemned alleged police brut
ality against blacks and vowed to promote black
leadership within the church.
The bishops demanded an investigation of
what they described as the "seemingly systema
tic beatings and unjustifiable shootings of blacks
during disturbances and of cold blooded torture
of detained persona."
In one of the most radical statements ever pub
lished by the church in South Africa, long a
champion of black rights, it declared:

"No temporary suppression by violence, only a
sharing of citizenship, can give hope of any
safety for children, black or white, now growing
up in the republic, and prevent the horrors of
civil war in the future."
IRA gunmen receive life sentences
London — Four Irish Republican Army gun
men were sentenced yesterday to life imprison
ment for seven killings and a dozen bombings
during an 18-month IRA offensive in English
cities.
Authorities said they were bracing for a possi
ble upsurge of IRA violence in reprisal for the
stiff sentences.
The judge in the case, Sir Joseph Cantley, who
had been told he was on the extremists' death list,
refrained from commenting on the threat of an
IRA campaign as he imposed the sentences in
Central Criminal Court, known to Londoners as
the Old Bailey. He recommended that each of the
four men serve no less than 30 years in prison
before being paroled.
The Provisionals have been fighting to end
British rule and Protestant domination in North
ern Ireland and to unite the province with the
Irish Republic, which is overwhelmingly
Catholic.
Natural gas shortage may worsen
Washington — The nation's natural gas shor
tage may continue until October and could be
come even worse in winters to come, a key fed
eral energy official said yesterday.
"We're not going to get out of today's crisis
possibly until next October" because of the need
to refill depleted storage supplies of natural gas
in preparation for next winter, said John O'Leary,
new head of the Federal Energy Administration.
"And indeed," O'Leary told the Consumer
Federation of America, "next winter, and the

next winter, and the next winter it's going to be
worse."
At the same time, government reports indi
cated the current mild weather had sent back to
the job thousands of workers laid off due to
natural gas shortages but that many more were
still out of work.
For the first time in weeks, the weather fore
cast, through Sunday, predicts temperatures
above normal for this time of year throughout the
entire nation.
