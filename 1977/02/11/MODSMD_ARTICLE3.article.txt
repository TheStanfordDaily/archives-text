# Joint committee to ferret out solutions to chem series woes
## 
### Jim Monen 
As a result of recent criticisms of the organic chemistry series, a faculty
student committee is being formed to evaluate and discuss improvements for the
Chemistry Department, according to Eugene VanTame'.en, department chair
man.
The department has not yet been approached officially by any student organi
zation, including David McFarland's group, which began circulating a petition
to improve the organic series thyee weeks ago.
But VanTamelen said he met informally with undergraduate Roger Barr on
Wednesday and approved the committee idea.
"The chemistry ad hoc committee and others from the department will be the
faculty representatives. Roger (Barr) is taking it upon himself to constitute the
undergraduate committee," said VanTamelen.
A date for the first meeting has not been set.
Gerald Lieberman, associate dean of the humanities and sciences, said his
office will not be officially involved with the committee.
"The purpose of the dean's office is to solve problems after two parties have
talked. If they (students) are not satisfied after talking to the chem department
they can come to us," Lieberman said.
He added, "I'm sure the chemistry department will be very cooperative."
VanTamelen echoed the sentiment/'TheChemistry Department is very glad to
meet with students. If both groups (on the committee) are intelligent about it,
something good can come out of it."
