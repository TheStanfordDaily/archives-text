# PA 'likely' to challenge 'Daily' search decision
## 
### John Freed 
The City of Palo Alto will "more
than likely" ask the U.S. Supreme
Court to overturn last week's landmark
decision which held that a 1971 search
of the Daily offices by Palo Alto police
was unconstitutional.
Marilyn Taketa, an assistant Palo
Alto city attorney, said the city will
first ask for a rehearing by the U.S.
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The
appeals court ruled Feb. 2 that police
violated the First and Fourth Amend
ments by conducting the search.
If the Court of Appeals grants a re
hearing, the case will be argued before
the same justices who heard the case
last Oct. 13, unless the court decides to
hear it en banc. In an en banc hearing,
every active justice in the Ninth Cir
cuit Court of Appeals would listen to
the arguments.
Legal experts said the frequency of
granting rehearings ranged from
"very, very, very rare" to "very, very,
very, very rare."
If the city's petition is denied, it will
have 60 days from the date of denial to
ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.
Authorization
"The city is authorized to pursue the
case to the Supreme Court," Taketa
said yesterday.
Jerome P'alk Jr., an attorney for the
Daily, said if the Supreme Court de
cides to hear the case, it would be for
one of two reasons.
"It's an important case, and the
principle applied is novel," Falk said.

He refused to speculate on whether the
Supreme Court would hear the case.
The original hearing before the
Court of Appeals in October did not go
well for the city. Taketa, who argued
the defendants' (police officers') case,
had just begun her opening statement
and said the case involved "a search
warrant issuance," when Justice Shir
ley Hufstedler interjected "issuance
and execution."
Throughout the rest of her argu
ments, Taketa was peppered by ques
tions from Hufstedler and justice
Alfred Coodwin.
1972 ruling upheld
The appeals court decision upheld
the 1972 ruling of federal ludge Robert

Peckham and rejected a claim that the
police were not proper defendants.
"(The defendants) raise this issue for
the first time upon appeal," the ap
peals court decision said. "In this re
spect, the argument is at least, un
timely. Moreover, we are not per
suaded that it has merit."
Falk explained why the police were
sued.
"They said they did it, asserted the
propriety of doing it, and asserted the
right to do it again. We thought they
were proper defendants," Falk said
Santa Clara County has not yet de
cided whether to appeal on behalf of
Dist. Atty. Louis Bergna and Asst. Dist.
Atty. Craig Brown, two of the defen
dants in the case, according to Bergna.
