# COP's Petroff vetoes ASSU pay amendment
## 
### Jill Liscom 
ASSU President Vic Petroff yester
day vetoed an amendment to the ASSU
Bylaws requiring that all salaries or
tuition grants to ASSU or senate offic
ers be raised through a fee assessment.
The amendment was passed by the
senate Monday.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) currently receives a $450 per
quarter tuition credit which members
can opt to take as salary. In addition,
they are paid $100 every month from
the time they are elected until the end
of August. For the remainder of their
term, they are paid $60 a month.
In his veto message to Senate
Chairman Pat Hall, Petroff said he vet
oed the amendment primarily because
it "effectively constitutes at least a
strong disincentive to, if not outright
discrimination against, students of
small or moderate financial means
who might be considering running for
the Council of Presidents."
Petroff also noted that officers sac
rifice having a summer job in order to
fulfill their responsibilities as a COP
member, so that students who depend
on a summer income could not afford
to serve on the COP.
It was for this same reason that
former ASSU President David Harris
set the precedent for salaried ASSU
officers in the 19605, Petroff said. Me
added that at least one member of the
current council would have been un

able to serve if there had been no com
pensation associated with the job.
He predicted that the "Power of the
Pursestring" amendment, if im
plemented, would have its greatest
impact on graduate and minority stu
dents.
Sen. Tim Ferguson, who proposed
the amendment, said he will attempt to
get an override of the veto at the next
senate meeting, to be held Monday at
7:30 p.m. in Hranner Hall.
Ferguson said Petroff's arguments
"are ones that should be made to the
student body and not the senate, be
cause it is the student body that should
decide whether and by how much its
officers are paid."
Sen. Doug Bandow said hefelt it was
"unfortunate" the amendment was
vetoed."
"I think it would add an incentive
for the officers to do a better job," he
said. "As the system is now, officers
get paid whether they do a good job or
not."
Petroff replied that although he was
not assuming the officers will never be
paid, "the question of whether or not a
salary would be involved would be to
tally up in the air."
Sen. Dan Livingston said another
consideration is that the summer pay
ment is "only a token fee," and for the
most part, "it is an honor to serve on
the COP."

consideration is that the summer pay
ment is "only a token fee," and for the
most part, "it is an honor to serve on
the COP."
ASSU President Vic Petroff yester
day vetoed an amendment to the ASSU
Bylaws requiring that all salaries or
tuition grants to ASSU or senate offic
ers be raised through a fee assessment.
The amendment was passed by the
senate Monday.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) currently receives a $450 per
quarter tuition credit which members
can opt to take as salary. In addition,
they are paid $100 every month from
the time they are elected until the end
of August. For the remainder of their
term, they are paid $60 a month.
In his veto message to Senate
Chairman Pat Hall, Petroff said he vet
oed the amendment primarily because
it "effectively constitutes at least a
strong disincentive to, if not outright
discrimination against, students of
small or moderate financial means
who might be considering running for
the Council of Presidents."
Petroff also noted that officers sac
rifice having a summer job in order to
fulfill their responsibilities as a COP
member, so that students who depend
on a summer income could not afford
to serve on the COP.
It was for this same reason that
former ASSU President David Harris
set the precedent for salaried ASSU
officers in the 19605, Petroff said. Me
added that at least one member of the
current council would have been un

able to serve if there had been no com
pensation associated with the job.
He predicted that the "Power of the
Pursestring" amendment, if im
plemented, would have its greatest
impact on graduate and minority stu
dents.
Sen. Tim Ferguson, who proposed
the amendment, said he will attempt to
get an override of the veto at the next
senate meeting, to be held Monday at
7:30 p.m. in Hranner Hall.
Ferguson said Petroff's arguments
"are ones that should be made to the
student body and not the senate, be
cause it is the student body that should
decide whether and by how much its
officers are paid."
Sen. Doug Bandow said hefelt it was
"unfortunate" the amendment was
vetoed."
"I think it would add an incentive
for the officers to do a better job," he
said. "As the system is now, officers
get paid whether they do a good job or
not."
Petroff replied that although he was
not assuming the officers will never be
paid, "the question of whether or not a
salary would be involved would be to
tally up in the air."
Sen. Dan Livingston said another
consideration is that the summer pay
ment is "only a token fee," and for the
most part, "it is an honor to serve on
the COP."
