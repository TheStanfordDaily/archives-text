# Drought situation 'terrifying'
## Water rationing coming here? 
### Cynthia Neil 
Water rationing could become
commonplace because of the'con
tinuing drought, according to
Robert Burnash of the National
Weather Service.
Burnash called the situation "ter
rifying" and said river flow in
California could drop to 18 per cent
of normal this year. The snowpack
is only 25 per cent of normal, he
said, noting that even if rain this
season is the heaviest on record
(which isn't expected) it would not
be enough to meet all water needs.
The University is making a con
certed effort to conserve water, ac
cording to Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis. He said water pressure
in all campus buildings is being cut
to the minimum and all decorative
fountains have been turned off.
Campus home owners are being
warned to water their lawns bet
ween 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. on alternate
days. Campus residents have also
been told to stop washing cars and
driveways and to fit toilet tanks and
shower heads with flow restricters.
Notices are being posted on
laboratories, bathrooms and
swimming pools urging people to
save water.
'Good response'
"These measures have been
well-publicized and we have re
ceived a good response," Mavis
said. "Last week we used two mill
ion gallons less water than we did
the same week last year."
The science labs still support the
academic program," said Mavis.
Stanford Hospital, he said, gets
water from Palo Alto rather than
from the University.
Palo Alto is also involved in a
massive water-saving campaign.
Residents are being asked to cut
water use by 10 per cent. Flow re
stricters will be placed on showers
and a bottle will be placed in toilets
to conserve water. Classes on water
conservation are being taught and
an advertising campaign has be

gun.
Palo Alto restaurants are being
asked not to serve water unless it is
requested, car washes are being
urged to conserve water and a task
force has been established to study
ways of conserving water.
City's efforts
On city property, fountains have
been shut off and flow restricters
are being used. Water mains and
fire hydrants are being flushed only
as needed.
Palo Alto is also speeding up a
reclamation system which will re
cycle water from the sewage plant
onto the golf course and parks. This
will account for 1/17 of all the water
in Palo Alto.
One area not drastically affected
by the drought is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve.
"Our job is to see what happens
in nature," said Al Grundmann, di
rector of the preserve. "The drought
has changed the sequence in which
some plants bloom, but for us the
drought is not a tragedy at all. If the
area turns to desert, we have a de
sert to study."
Statewide, the situation worse

already drought-stricken Marin
County with drastic imposed
rationing measures.
Statewide rationing
In Sacramento, Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy said
California probably should impose
statewide water rationing to meet
what he termed "a crisis of extraor
dinary magnitude," the Associated
Press reported yesterday.
"Many people will go bankrupt
in this state, many thousands of
people will be out of work, and con
sumers. . . very soon will be paying
skyrocketing prices" if the water
shortage gets worse. McCarthy told
reporters.
"It's not just a Northern Califor

Statewide rationing
In Sacramento, Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy said
California probably should impose
statewide water rationing to meet
what he termed "a crisis of extraor
dinary magnitude," the Associated
Press reported yesterday.
"Many people will go bankrupt
in this state, many thousands of
people will be out of work, and con
sumers. . . very soon will be paying
skyrocketing prices" if the water
shortage gets worse. McCarthy told
reporters.
"It's not just a Northern Califor
nia problem. ... It ultimately
touches everybody in the state as

State officials apparently agreed
with McCarthy's assessment as they
hammered out an agreement to
have six to 10 million gallons of
water transferred to Marin County
by the beginning of this summer.
California is the hardest hit of the
dry Western states.
Some states report so little snow
for the winter that spring runoffs
are expected to be seriously below
normal levels. In some places,
water levels may be so low this
spring that electricity produced
hydroelectrically will be in short
supply.
Water rationing could become
commonplace because of the'con
tinuing drought, according to
Robert Burnash of the National
Weather Service.
Burnash called the situation "ter
rifying" and said river flow in
California could drop to 18 per cent
of normal this year. The snowpack
is only 25 per cent of normal, he
said, noting that even if rain this
season is the heaviest on record
(which isn't expected) it would not
be enough to meet all water needs.
The University is making a con
certed effort to conserve water, ac
cording to Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis. He said water pressure
in all campus buildings is being cut
to the minimum and all decorative
fountains have been turned off.
Campus home owners are being
warned to water their lawns bet
ween 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. on alternate
days. Campus residents have also
been told to stop washing cars and
driveways and to fit toilet tanks and
shower heads with flow restricters.
Notices are being posted on
laboratories, bathrooms and
swimming pools urging people to
save water.
'Good response'
"These measures have been
well-publicized and we have re
ceived a good response," Mavis
said. "Last week we used two mill
ion gallons less water than we did
the same week last year."
The science labs still support the
academic program," said Mavis.
Stanford Hospital, he said, gets
water from Palo Alto rather than
from the University.
Palo Alto is also involved in a
massive water-saving campaign.
