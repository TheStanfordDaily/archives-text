## Opinions Directed education

Stanford's undergradutecurriculum
has been the subject of somewhat
heated debate. In the Nov. 18 Daily, a
group of concerned humanities pro
fessors published a long diatribe enti
tled "To Strengthen Undergraduate
Curriculum." They proposed that a
Western Culture requirement be
reinstated in the interest of ensuring a
liberal education for all.
While my background in the
humanities is consonant with their
convictions, 1 am dismayed by their
disregard of the student's point of
view. They insist that today's under
graduate "needs more guidance and
direction than ever before." I am trou
bled by the nature of the guidance they
wish to impose. It is singleminded
pursuit of the values they hold dear, in
other words, their bread and butter.
Well-wrought advice is eschewed in
favor of unilateral dictate. They incon
gruously contradict a crucial principle
of western thoughtâ€”individual au
tonomy.
Well-rounded schooling
The college curriculum should be
designed to abet growth of a student's
perceptions of significant relation
ships in his world. The institution can
provide guidance by indicating what
might be significant for each student
in light of his or her academic and pro
fessional aspirations as well as his or
her psychological needs.
The goal of the college curriculum,
in conjunction with the guidance sys
tem, should be to see to it that students
make rational choices on the basis of

the best available information about
economic realities and personal aspi
rations. Most current students are not
being given this information, nor are
they being encouraged to examine
their own assumptions about them
selves.
Enter the counselors
Parents and advisors may encourage
students to study the practical aspects
of their educational endeavors, yet
they are not furnished with good in
formation about possible career and
financial prospects.
Career planning and placement of
fices should be providing this informa
tion. However, at least at Stanford, a
brief telephone survey I undertook of
randomly selected undergraduates in
dicated that the Career Planning and
Placement Office (CPPC) is not fulfil
ling the helping role. During an inter
view at the CPPC the director told me
that students simply do not avail
themselves of the services and that the
CPPC does not have the resources for
active recruitment of clientele.
On the other hand, the telephone
survey produced statements such as
this: "the counseling services are
good for those who know what they are
about, otherwise it's bullshit."
Professorial concern
The other half of advising respon
sibilities is allocated to the profes
soriat. Coordination between the two
sectors is minimal. The professors lack
guidance training and have an under
standable proclivity for partiality. The
scholar tends to believe that his wis-

dom should be ascendant and that re
sponsiveness to the needs of adoles
cents is repugnant and ridiculous.
Steps should be taken to ensure that
all are made aware of the value of the
humanities in the face of the skill
oriented educational environment.
The purely financial approach of the
career-centered student fails to ac
count for the consumption benefits of
education.
Perhaps, if there is to be any required
course it should be entitled "Why
Educate Myself?" Its goal would be to
allow students to make informed
choices. It structure could include dis
cussions lead by deans, department
heads, CPPC counselors, philosophers
and economists of education. Students
would thereby be furnished with the
diverse academic perspectives, the
philosophies of Whitehead and Skin
ner, and econometric evidence such as
manpower forecasts, individual rates
of return and earnings foregone.
