# Anatomy class
## 
### 
I am highly appreciative to the gent
leman who donated his body to Stan
ford Medical School. After six months
of dissection, 32 disposable scalpel
blades and 75 pair of plastic gloves, I
have become quite familiar with the
inner secrets of human anatomy.
Without his selfless decision, my med
ical knowledge would be considerably
impoverished.
The dissecting room was cold and
ancient. When we first entered, we
found 21 tables each with a bulky
black plastic bag on it. I unzipped the
bag at my table and looked down upon
a silent corpse, as pale as paper mache.
A pungent odor floated up. It was a
glycol-based preservative, smelling
something like 100 proof bubble gum.
We were hesitant to begin dissec
tion. In the great tradition of Hippoc
rates, Galen and Da Vinci, we just stood
there and twirled our scalpels. Then
Beverly sliced into the chest. At that
point, all four members of our group
proceeded to cut and peel off skin from
the torso.
Skipping lunch
Anatomy lab was in the afternoon.
On the first day. some students skip
ped lunch while others ate early. By
the second week, a few open cans of
Coke appeared near the tables. By the
fourth week, salami sandwiches,
raspberry yogurt and granola cookies
were routinely consumed during dis
section.
While on the subject of digestion, it
should be noted that the small intes
tine is about 26 feet long. The dissec
tion manual instructs us to trace the
intestine from stomach to rectum. It is
very easy to get lost along 26 feet of
slippery bowel.
If you think you're tracing it for
wards, then you soon find you're actu
ally heading back to the esophagus. If
you think you're at the ileum, then
you're actually at the jejunum, or

perhaps the duodenum.
William Harvey in 1628 first prop
ounded the theory that the blood circu
lates throughout the body and is
pumped by the heart. Three and one
half centuries later, it was quite a thrill
to perform the final cuts and snips and
to yank that precious organ up out of
the chest. Hearts are smaller and more
rubbery than I had expected. A nearby
group of students soon discovered that
this vital pump can be tossed around
the room, somewhat like a wet softball.
Color coded
In the well-preserved human being,
the liver is brown, the gallbladder is
green, fat is yellow and skin is pale. In
the poorly preserved human being, we
soon learned that the liver is green, the
gallbladder is lost, fat is liquified and
the skin is white, purple or reddish
brown. This made it difficult to corre
late our findings with the color scheme
in Grant's Atlas of Anatomy.
We discovered that it is useless to
test for reflexes in a cadaver. Yet, as
soon as the muscles and tendons of the
forearm are dissected out, various
muscular-articular manipulations be
came possible.
For example, when certain flexor di
gitorum muscles were pulled at the el
bow, the hand grasped a can of Coke.
With a little tension on the pronator
teres, the Coke could be poured into a
cup.
It should be evident that the rela
tionship between the cadaver and the
dissector is very close, certainly built
upon a foundation of mutual respect.
In that cold anatomy laboratory, I
learned the equivalent of a foreign lan
guage and placed in my mind the
physical construction of the human
organism. All, of course, for the pur
pose of healing the living.

student.)
