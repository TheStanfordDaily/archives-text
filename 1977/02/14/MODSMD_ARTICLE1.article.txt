# ASSU assessment plan could hurt student groups

### Jill Liscom 
If the University enacts an ASSU se
nate resolution on fee assessments, "it
will mean a virtual end to KZSU," ac
cording to KZSU station director Larry
Goldman.
At its meeting last Monday, the se
nate voted 11-4 to give students the
option of not paying fee assessments at
registration day.
Presently, students must pay as
sessments at registration but can re
ceive refunds on request three weeks
later at Tresidder Union.
"The only way we survive is from
student money," said Goldman.
"Without that money, we would have
to discontinue our UPI service, cut
back on all of our departments and ac
tivities, and not be able to cover any
away games."
According to Doug Bandow, who
submitted the resolution, the fee as
sessment system now is unfair to stu
dents. "We say it's voluntary, but it's
almost as if we're trying to hide the fact
that people can get their money back."
Newell LaVoy, Daily business man
ager, said even though student money
is only about 10 per cent of yearly in
come, loss of that money could cause
financial problems for the Daily.
Rich Johnson, band director,
thought the voluntary fee assessment
would result in about a 50 per cent loss
of assessment revenue for the band.
According to Johnson, student
money makes up 40 per cent of the
band's income. "Without that money,

we'd have to cut out at least one of our
big trips."
Goldman said last quarter KZSU had
the second largest amount of money
refunded, an estimated $1200, but
thought it was because, "people just
don't know what KZSU is."
KZSU program director Wayne Mil
ler commented, "if people keep taking
their dollars back from KZSU, we'll try
to find out what we're doing wrong by
student polls."
LaVoy said he was against having
voluntary assessments because "it

would obviously be detrimental."
LaVoy explained, "by paying the fee
assessment, students are buying a
block subscription so they can have a
Daily every day. It's like they're buy
ing it just like they buy any other
newspaper. When people take their
dollar back, I assume they've decided
that they have no use for the Daily."
In an attempt to make refunds more
accessible to students, the senate voted
last month to refund money in White
Plaza rather than Tresidder, starting
spring quarter.
