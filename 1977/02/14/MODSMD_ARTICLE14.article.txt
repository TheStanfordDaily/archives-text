# Former Stanford prof criticized
## Mixed judgment on Brown's judges 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr.'s nomination of
the first black, to the California
Supreme Court was praised in
legal circles, but the woman he
wants to be chief justice drew a
mixed reaction.
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, the
only Republican holding
statewide elective office, hailed
the nomination of Alameda
County Superior Court Judge
Wiley Manuel, 49, as an as
sociate justice.
However, Younger, one of the
three members of the state
Commission on Judicial Ap
pointments that must approve
the nominations, was critical of
Brown's choice of Rose
Elizabeth Bird, 40, as chief jus
tice.
"Manuel is a good appoint
ment, but not the other one,"
said Younger, who is regarded as
a likely candidate for the GOP
nomination to run against
Brown in 1978.
Bird, the California secretary
of agriculture and services
would be the first woman ever to
serve on the court.
Brown first met Bird while
both were students at the Uni
versity of California's Boalt Law
School. After she graduated from
law school in 1953, she clerked
for the chief justice of the
Nevada Supreme Court.
In 1966 she started as a senior
trial deputy for the Santa Clara
County public defender's office.
She taught criminal and con
sumer law at Stanford Law
School before joining the Brown
administration two years ago.

If confirmed, Bird would be
come only the second woman
ever to head a state supreme
court. Chief Justice Susie Sharp
of North Carolina was the first in
1975.
Younger said in reviewing the
two appointments he would
consider only whether the ap
pointee was qualified. Asked if
there were anything that would
disqualify Bird, he answered: "I
wouldn't comment on that."
Mike Montgomery, who was
chosen Saturday to head the
California Republican Party,
said he found the nomination of
Bird disappointing because "she
has had no judicial experience
either at the trial or the appellate
level."
Bird's appointment was de
clared "a daring move" by
Wylile Aitken of Santa Ana,
head of the 5100-member
California Trial Lawyers Associ
ation.
He added, "We predict it will
be an outstanding one."
William Warren, now dean of
the UCLA law school, worked
closely with her at Stanford in
the area of consumer law. He
said, "She is a superb criminal
lawyer. I doubt if we have had
anybody on the court with the
knowledge she has from the
perspective of defending."
In announcing the two nomi
nations Saturday, Brown said
both would inject "a good sense
of balance and wisdom" into the
court.
Manuel, who declares himself

"a middle of the roader," at
tended Hastings law school
where he ranked at the top of his
class for two of his three years.
Before being appointed to the
county court a year ago, he spent
22 years with the state attorney

general's office.
A 1 Cordon, a spokesman for
the attorney general's office, said
Manuel "was an excellent attor
ney, probably one of the best the
state has had the good fortune to
have in its employ."
