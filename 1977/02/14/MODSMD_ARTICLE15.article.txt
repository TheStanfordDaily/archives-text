# Washington ambushes UCLA
## 
### Chris Baker 
Just when it looked like the
Pacific-8 basketball race was
over, UCLA made things in
teresting again.
The second-ranked Bruins lost
their third game of the season —
a 78-73 decision to Washington
Saturday night in Seattle. The
loss drops UCLA to 7-2 in the
conference, only a game ahead of
Oregon, Oregon State and
Washington. Next week UCLA
hits the road again, visiting Ore
gon and Oregon State.
"You've got to be sharp, got to
be up, to beat somebody on the
road," said UCLA coach Gene
Bartow after the loss. "You've

also got to shoot 50 or 55 per cent
or you're going to get beat."
Johnson stars
The Bruins did indeed hit 53.7
per cent of their field goals and
senior All-American Marquess
Johnson came through again
with 31 points.
But mistakes — a pair of tur
novers late in the contest — did
the Bruins in. Johnson narrowed
the Huskies' lead to 73-71 on a
three-point play with 1:10 re
maining. But in the last minute,
UCLA got only one field goal, as
Washington was fouled seven
times.
Mike Neil scored 20 points
and center James Edwards

pumped in 19 for Washington.
The Bruins might have been a
little overconfident after watch
ing California upset Oregon
State Saturday afternoon. The
Beavers — supposedly the only
team with a chance to catch
UCLA going into this weekend's
action — were surprised by
California. 84-83.
Key free throws
Doug True, a 6-foot-7
freshman forward, hit two free
throws with 17 seconds left, to
clinch the victory.
The Beavers, who beat Stan
ford by a single point Thursday
night, got off two late shots by
Ricky Lee and Dwayne Allen.

Allen's attempt was with four
seconds left and forward Ray
Murray, who led Cal with 29
points, soared high to grab his
17th rebound.
OSU led Cal three different
times during the final seven mi
nutes. Lee had put the Beavers
ahead 83-82 on a slam dunk with
53 seconds left and set the stage
for True's key free throws.
Rocky Smith, one of the best
guards on the West Coast, paced
the Beavers with 23 points and
Lee added 18.
USC made losing look easy in
dropping a 72-50 decision to
Washington State Saturday in
Pullman. The Trojans made only
six of 33 shots in the second half.
