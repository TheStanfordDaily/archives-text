# Mistakes kill Stanford
## Oregon quacks Cardinals 
### David Georgette 
"It seems that when we get
within a couple of points, we
make a mistake," said coach
Dick Dißiaso Saturday night
after his Stanford Cardinals had
lost a 7 4-65 contest to the Oregon
Ducks.
With seven and a half minutes
to go in the game, the Cardinals
had closed to within 59-57 on a
three-point play by Jeff McHugh
who had been fouled by Ore
gon's Greg "G.8." Ballard on a
lay-in.
A couple of Stanford turnov
ers and three lay-ins by Oregon's
Ernie Kent followed a 20-foot
jump shot by the Duck guard
John Murray to make the score
69-59 with under two minutes to
go. Oregon secured its victory
with five free throws in the last
55 seconds.
"We played with a lot of pride
tonight," said Duck coach Dick
Harter. "I was proud of our
players for the way they per
formed after the struggle Thurs
day night."
Thursday the Ducks lost to Cal
in five overtimes, 107-102.
"Stanford played much better
than they did in our place last
week. If we'd played the way we
did Thursday, we would have
lost," said Harter.
Good execution
"We executed better this
time," said Dißiaso in compar
ing the Cards' performance
Saturday to last Friday's loss in
McArthur Court. "But the results
weren't any different. We lost."
Two reasons the Cards lost
were Ballard and Murray. Bal

lard hit nine of 14 shots from the
floor and grabbed seven re
bounds while Murray missed
only four shots the whole game
on the way to 19 points. 13 of
them coming in the first half.
Murray's five first-half field
goals came from at least 18 feet
out on the way to the Ducks'
37-34 halftime lead. Stanford's
Mike Bratz carried the load for
the Cards in the first half with 13
points.
Good free throwing
The Cards hit an amazing 18 of
19 from the charity stripe in the
first stanza as Oregon committed
its seventh team foul eight mi
nutes into the game. In the sec
ond half, the Ducks did not get
whistled for a foul until twelve
minutes had elapsed.
"I find it hard to believe that
they can play that kind of de
fense without getting into the
one-and-one," said Dißiaso.
"We didn't play any different
in the second half," said Harter.
"That's just the way they called
it."
Early in the second half, the
Cards three times closed to
within one point. But Ballard re
sponded to the Stanford chal
lenge by scoring twelve straight
points for the Ducks as Oregon
went up 55-50. McHugh then
closed the gap to 59-57 with
seven straight Stanford points.
McHugh shines
"McHugh had one of his best,
if not his best, games of the sea
son," said Dißiaso. McHugh
played all but a minute and a half
of the game and was the contest's
top rebounder to go along with
his 17 points.
Dißiaso chose to go with a
man-to-man defense for most of
the game in order to "meet in
tensity with intensity" and also
in an attempt to stop the Ducks'
good outside shooters. The
Ducks ended up shooting 58

per cent from the field for the
game.
The man-to-man defense al
lowed Ballard to get loose, too.
Ballard's play opened things
up for the other Ducks, in par
ticular Mike Drummond. "We
tried to go on G.B. 's side as much
as possible," said Drummond .
When the Cards converged on
Ballard under the basket,
Drummond was left free on the
outside where he connected on
four of his six long-range jum
pers. Drummond also passed off
for a game-high six assists.
Defensively, Drummond was
credited by Harter with holding
Bratz to only two points in the
second half. "The key was
Drummond against Bratz," Har
ter said.
The victory put the Ducks
right back into contention.
"There's five games left; any
thing can happen," said Drum

mond about the remainder of the
season and the conference race.
That's right. Anything can
happen, but when will Stanford
win again is another question.

had closed to within 59-57 on a
three-point play by Jeff McHugh
who had been fouled by Ore
gon's Greg "G.8." Ballard on a
lay-in.
A couple of Stanford turnov
ers and three lay-ins by Oregon's
Ernie Kent followed a 20-foot
jump shot by the Duck guard
John Murray to make the score
69-59 with under two minutes to
go. Oregon secured its victory
with five free throws in the last
55 seconds.
"We played with a lot of pride
tonight," said Duck coach Dick
Harter. "I was proud of our
players for the way they per
formed after the struggle Thurs
day night."
Thursday the Ducks lost to Cal
in five overtimes, 107-102.
"Stanford played much better
than they did in our place last
week. If we'd played the way we
did Thursday, we would have
lost," said Harter.
Good execution
"We executed better this
time," said Dißiaso in compar
ing the Cards' performance
Saturday to last Friday's loss in
McArthur Court. "But the results
weren't any different. We lost."
Two reasons the Cards lost
were Ballard and Murray. Bal

lard hit nine of 14 shots from the
floor and grabbed seven re
bounds while Murray missed
only four shots the whole game
on the way to 19 points. 13 of
them coming in the first half.
Murray's five first-half field
goals came from at least 18 feet
out on the way to the Ducks'
37-34 halftime lead. Stanford's
Mike Bratz carried the load for
the Cards in the first half with 13
points.
Good free throwing
The Cards hit an amazing 18 of
19 from the charity stripe in the
first stanza as Oregon committed
its seventh team foul eight mi
nutes into the game. In the sec
ond half, the Ducks did not get
whistled for a foul until twelve
minutes had elapsed.
"I find it hard to believe that
they can play that kind of de
fense without getting into the
one-and-one," said Dißiaso.
"We didn't play any different
in the second half," said Harter.
"That's just the way they called
it."
Early in the second half, the
Cards three times closed to
within one point. But Ballard re
sponded to the Stanford chal
lenge by scoring twelve straight
points for the Ducks as Oregon
went up 55-50. McHugh then
closed the gap to 59-57 with
seven straight Stanford points.
McHugh shines
"McHugh had one of his best,
if not his best, games of the sea
son," said Dißiaso. McHugh
played all but a minute and a half
of the game and was the contest's
top rebounder to go along with
his 17 points.
Dißiaso chose to go with a
man-to-man defense for most of
the game in order to "meet in
tensity with intensity" and also
in an attempt to stop the Ducks'
good outside shooters. The
Ducks ended up shooting 58

per cent from the field for the
game.
The man-to-man defense al
lowed Ballard to get loose, too.
Ballard's play opened things
up for the other Ducks, in par
ticular Mike Drummond. "We
tried to go on G.B. 's side as much
as possible," said Drummond .
When the Cards converged on
Ballard under the basket,
Drummond was left free on the
outside where he connected on
four of his six long-range jum
pers. Drummond also passed off
for a game-high six assists.
Defensively, Drummond was
credited by Harter with holding
Bratz to only two points in the
second half. "The key was
Drummond against Bratz," Har
ter said.
The victory put the Ducks
right back into contention.
"There's five games left; any
thing can happen," said Drum

mond about the remainder of the
season and the conference race.
That's right. Anything can
happen, but when will Stanford
win again is another question.

John Murray to make the score
69-59 with under two minutes to
go. Oregon secured its victory
with five free throws in the last
55 seconds.
"We played with a lot of pride
tonight," said Duck coach Dick
Harter. "I was proud of our
players for the way they per
formed after the struggle Thurs
day night."
Thursday the Ducks lost to Cal
in five overtimes, 107-102.
"Stanford played much better
than they did in our place last
week. If we'd played the way we
did Thursday, we would have
lost," said Harter.
Good execution
"We executed better this
time," said Dißiaso in compar
ing the Cards' performance
Saturday to last Friday's loss in
McArthur Court. "But the results
weren't any different. We lost."
Two reasons the Cards lost
were Ballard and Murray. Bal

lard hit nine of 14 shots from the
floor and grabbed seven re
bounds while Murray missed
only four shots the whole game
on the way to 19 points. 13 of
them coming in the first half.
Murray's five first-half field
goals came from at least 18 feet
out on the way to the Ducks'
37-34 halftime lead. Stanford's
Mike Bratz carried the load for
the Cards in the first half with 13
points.
Good free throwing
The Cards hit an amazing 18 of
19 from the charity stripe in the
first stanza as Oregon committed
its seventh team foul eight mi
nutes into the game. In the sec
ond half, the Ducks did not get
whistled for a foul until twelve
minutes had elapsed.
"I find it hard to believe that
they can play that kind of de
fense without getting into the
one-and-one," said Dißiaso.
"We didn't play any different
in the second half," said Harter.
"That's just the way they called
it."
Early in the second half, the
Cards three times closed to
within one point. But Ballard re
sponded to the Stanford chal
lenge by scoring twelve straight
points for the Ducks as Oregon
went up 55-50. McHugh then
closed the gap to 59-57 with
seven straight Stanford points.
McHugh shines
"McHugh had one of his best,
if not his best, games of the sea
son," said Dißiaso. McHugh
played all but a minute and a half
of the game and was the contest's
top rebounder to go along with
his 17 points.
Dißiaso chose to go with a
man-to-man defense for most of
the game in order to "meet in
tensity with intensity" and also
in an attempt to stop the Ducks'
good outside shooters. The
Ducks ended up shooting 58

per cent from the field for the
game.
The man-to-man defense al
lowed Ballard to get loose, too.
Ballard's play opened things
up for the other Ducks, in par
ticular Mike Drummond. "We
tried to go on G.B. 's side as much
as possible," said Drummond .
When the Cards converged on
Ballard under the basket,
Drummond was left free on the
outside where he connected on
four of his six long-range jum
pers. Drummond also passed off
for a game-high six assists.
Defensively, Drummond was
credited by Harter with holding
Bratz to only two points in the
second half. "The key was
Drummond against Bratz," Har
ter said.
The victory put the Ducks
right back into contention.
"There's five games left; any
thing can happen," said Drum

mond about the remainder of the
season and the conference race.
That's right. Anything can
happen, but when will Stanford
win again is another question.
