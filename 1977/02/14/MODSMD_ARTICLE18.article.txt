# Volleyball team falls to UCLA
## 
### Richard Keller 
Before Friday night's match against UCLA, someone asked Stan
ford volleyball coach Art l-ambert if his team was going to beat the
defending NCAA champions from UCLA. Lambert completed his
lineup card, looked at the man, and gave one of those subdued
"you've got to be kidding" laughs without saying a word.
He wasn't surprised that the Bruins swatted the Cards 15-12,
15-10, 15-9 in their second meeting of the year before 2200 fans in
Maples Pavillion.
It was a contest between a tall, powerful, experienced Bruin squad
and a shorter, inexperienced Stanford team. In their previous meet
ing this year, Stanford was easily crushed 15-9, 15-6,15-5. This time
around, however, the Cardinals displayed some signs of improve
ment. As team captain Tom Duralde said, "We weren't nearly as
nervous as before."
Freshman Kim Lum opened the scoring in the first game, and the
Card netters held the lead until UCLA tied at 7-7. The teams then
jockeyed back and forth until a Duralde touch shot over the Bruin
blockers narrowed UCLA's lead to one point — 9-8.

Five straight points
The Cards then lost the ensu
ing five points on a shanked
spike by Rich Rand and an
onslaught of UCLA quick-sets.
Stanford never got back in the
game, losing 15-12.
Except at 4-3, the Cards trailed
the entire second game. The only
highlight was at 9-4, when a
Stanford back donated his body
to the floor with a spectacular
dig off a Bruin spike.
The ball skidded backwards
off his hands and sailed towards
the Penzoil scoreboard in the far
corner of the arena. Rand got
under the ball to make an incred
ible save, and Duralde followed
with a backwards launch over
the net. Despite UCLA putting
the ball away on the next shot,
the crowd responded with a
standing ovation.
Final game
In the final game, the Bruins
had a net call go against them at
7-7 to give Stanford the serve. On
the next point, Duralde spiked a
sharply angled shot into the
open left side, and Rand com
plemented that with a winning
block, pushing the score to 9-7.
Unfortunately, the Cards were
shut out the remainder of the
game, losing 15-9.
Coach Lambert had nothing
but praise for his team after the
match. "I couldn't be prouder of
the guys playing the national
champions," he said. "We have
improved defensively, but we're
still not as strong as we should
be." He named Lum, Duralde
and Andy Fishburn as the stand
outs for the Cards.
Lambert, however, had even
more praise for UCLA. "They've
got so many talented athletes.
Their setters are superb. They
block for points. And they'll put
the . . . ball away every time!"
