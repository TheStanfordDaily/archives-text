# Fee assessment refunds down
## 
### Will Nixon 
Students here collected 10 per cent of fee assessment
money in refunds this quarter, three per cent less than last
quarter. After refunding $3695 and spending $127 for office
expenses, the ASSU Senate divided $31,493 between
KZSU, the Daily and the band.
Refunds were issued in the ASSU lobby from Jan. 17 to
Jan. 28. Overseas students asked for $680. with two cam
puses yet to report refund requests. A $1 fee assessment for
each organization was collected with winter quarter tuition
payments.
KZSU received $10,478. It lost $1251 to refunds. KZSU
business manager John Morris said the station "certainly
needed quarterly assessments." Last quarter the ASSU gave
it $10,846 with $1826 going to refunds.
Being a noncommercial station, KZSU relies almost en
tirely on assessment money, said Morris. Area merchants
underwrite a few shows, primarily sports programs. The
University also funds the station, but gives less than $500 a
year.
The band got $10,393 after $1336 went to refunds. Band

manager Rich Johnson said he felt, "people were pretty
much satisfied with how the band money was spent." He
attributed refunds more to people "people in need of a
couple bucks rather than dissatisfaction with the band."
Last fall, the band collected $11,020 with $1652 going to
refunds. Unlike the Daily and KZSU, the band asks for
assessment money only in autumn and winter.
Johnson said this money covers 40 to 45 per cent of the
band's expenses. Only ASSU money can be used for the
band to travel out of state. This year the band spent over
$13,000 to visit Penn State for the opening football game of
the season.
The Athletic Department is the band's other major source
of funding. Johnson said this quarter's "money will cover
expenses incured."
The ASSU gave the Daily $10,621 which meant $1108
was refunded. Daily business manager Newell LaVoy
pointed out that the Daily refunded the least money. LaVoy
considered the fee assessment to be "like a subscription
which the students buy in bulk." The ASSU money comes
to about 10 per cent of the Daily budget.
