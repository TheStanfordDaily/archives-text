## Trojans drown Card swimmers 
### Julie Fielder 
There couldn't have been a
nicer place to be Saturday af
ternoon than at deCuerre
Pool. The sun was shining,
the entertainment was cap
tivating and all the swim
mers' times were good.
Just about the only thing
missing for Stanford swim
mers and fans was a victory
over three-time NCAA
champion USC. But then,
who could expect that? Mak
ing a fine showing, the Cards
fell to the Trojans, 81-52.
Backed by eight 1976
Olympians, USC won 10 of 15
events. World champion
backstroker John Naber, win
ner of four Olympic gold
medals, got an ovation from
the 2000 as he stepped on the
blocks for his first event, the
200-yard freestyle.
Gold medalist
Having won a gold medal
in Montreal in this event,
Naber came in second to
teammate and fellow Olym
pian Steve Pickel 1. A native of
Menlo Park, Naber did not
swim his Olympic backstroke
events.
Coach Peter Deland, at
tempting to qualify Naber for
the NCAAs, entered him in
the 500 free and the 400 free
relay. Naber captured a first
in the 500 free with a
4:29.269.
Stanford Olympian Mike
Bruner surpassed the pool re
cord he set last week in the

200 fly with a time of 1:48.96.
Well under the NCAA qual
ifying mark, Bruner bettered
the previous USC-Stanford
meet record time set by the
Cards' John Ferris in 1971.
Bruner also won the 1000
free, clocking a 9:16.28.
Meet record
Stanford freshman Bob
Hagberg exhibited a fine per
formance in the 100-yard but
terfly. His time of 50.636
broke both the meet and pool
record of 51.7 set by (JSC's
Mike Bottom in 1974. Hag
berg holds the fastest 100 fly
time in Stanford history, a
49.1 set while in high school.
The Cards got off to a strong
start and led in scoring

through the first five events.
But after the Trojans picked
up a first and third place in
the 50 free, USC jumped
ahead 28-26. From there, the
Trojans were hard to stop.
Stanford sprinter Dave
Fairbank came in second in
both his individual events —
the 50 and 100 free behind
(JSC's Joe Bottom. Fairbank
and Bottom have a long
rivalry going.
For the past three years,
Fairbank has edged out Bot
tom in dual meets, but has
been defeated in NCAA com
petition. But Fairbank is hop
ing for a complete role rever
sal in the NCAAs atCleveland
State next month.

In addition to Bottom, other
double winners were USC
freshman Bob Tierney who
set new meet and pool re
cords in the 100 back (51.88)
and 200 back (1:52.876), and
Stanford's Stu Corliss in the
100 breast (59.708) and 200
breast (2:09.071).
Additional meet records
were set by USC's Kirt Fre
dericks in the 200 1M and
Steve Pickell in the 200 free.
Fredericks posted a 1:54.237,
bettering a 1:54.71 mark set
by the Trojan's Alan Poucher
in 1975. Pickell's time of
1:40.677 surpassed teammate
Scott Findorff's 1:41.7 record
set last year.
