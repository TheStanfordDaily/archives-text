Carter to meet with U.N. ambassador
Plains, Ga. — President Jimmy Carter cut short a
weekend visit to his hometown yesterday to return to
Washington for a meeting with U.N. ambassador Andrew
Young.
The return flight, which was advanced several hours,
followed Young's comments that he thought former Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger had "abandoned" Great Britain
in the efforts aimed at turning over the reins of Rhodesia's
government from the white minority to the black majority
there.
Carter said he thought Young's remarks had been taken
out of context, adding that the ambassador suggested in a
telephone conversation that his 10-day trip to Africa was
successful.
Carter said he did not think Young said it in a critical way.
Because of the presidential election, Carter said, former
President Gerald Ford and Kissinger "could not proceed as
vigorously" with U.S. policy in Africa as they might have
wanted to.
Some of the world "trouble spots went into limbo" dur
ing the election and many world leaders sifnply awaited a
new president to take office. He said that situation was "no
reflection on secretary Kissinger or President Ford."
Steelworkers begin contract talks
Washington — The United Steelworkers union and the
nation's steel producers open contract talks today with the
future of the industry's historic no-strike agreement staked
on the outcome.
Substantial wage increases and "lifetime job security"
head a wide-ranging and ambitious set of general bargain
ing goals fashioned by 800 local union presidents at meet
ings here Saturday and yesterday.
The talks, covering nearly 340,000 workers, will be con
ducted under the industry's Experimental Negotiating Ag
reement which bans an industrywide strike and provides
for arbitration instead.
But discontent in some steel locals, stirred by the union's

bitter election campaign, has put the future of the peace
agreement in doubt.
A 29-page statement of the union's bargaining goals is
sued yesterday noted the agreement was still viewed as an
experiment even though it was first used in 1974.
Under the agreement, the companies are already commit
ted to minimum wage, cost-of-living and other benefits that
industry officials estimate will increase hourly employ
ment costs 26 per cent over the lifeof the three-year contract
to be negotiated this year.
Steel workers currently average $ti.l 1 an hour, plus fringe
benefits.
Independent Quebec — close to U.S.?
Quebec City, Canada — An independent Quebec would
move closer to the United States economically and might
encourage worker participation in the management of pri
vate enterprise, the provincial government's chief
economic planner says.
"The future for Quebec is in the processing of our raw
material products here, and in many north-south interna
tional exchanges with the United States, especially the East
Coast," said. Bernard Landry, minister of state for economic
development.
Landry is a member of the three-month-old Parti
Quebecois (PQ) government. ThePQ has vowed to lead the
French-speaking province toward independence from the
rest of English-dominated Canada and says it will put the
question to Quebec voters in a referendum.
Economic and cultural concerns are intertwined in the
separatist movement, Landry said in a recent interview.
"In the Quebec tradition the fight against domination has
always linked the two patterns, the cultural and the
economic," he said.
Today's weather
Forecast fair and mild through tomorrow except patches
of dense fog night and morning hours. Lows both nights in
the 40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the 60s to low 70s.

Carter said he did not think Young said it in a critical way.
Because of the presidential election, Carter said, former
President Gerald Ford and Kissinger "could not proceed as
vigorously" with U.S. policy in Africa as they might have
wanted to.
Some of the world "trouble spots went into limbo" dur
ing the election and many world leaders sifnply awaited a
new president to take office. He said that situation was "no
reflection on secretary Kissinger or President Ford."
Steelworkers begin contract talks
Washington — The United Steelworkers union and the
nation's steel producers open contract talks today with the
future of the industry's historic no-strike agreement staked
on the outcome.
Substantial wage increases and "lifetime job security"
head a wide-ranging and ambitious set of general bargain
ing goals fashioned by 800 local union presidents at meet
ings here Saturday and yesterday.
The talks, covering nearly 340,000 workers, will be con
ducted under the industry's Experimental Negotiating Ag
reement which bans an industrywide strike and provides
for arbitration instead.
But discontent in some steel locals, stirred by the union's

bitter election campaign, has put the future of the peace
agreement in doubt.
A 29-page statement of the union's bargaining goals is
sued yesterday noted the agreement was still viewed as an
experiment even though it was first used in 1974.
Under the agreement, the companies are already commit
ted to minimum wage, cost-of-living and other benefits that
industry officials estimate will increase hourly employ
ment costs 26 per cent over the lifeof the three-year contract
to be negotiated this year.
Steel workers currently average $ti.l 1 an hour, plus fringe
benefits.
Independent Quebec — close to U.S.?
Quebec City, Canada — An independent Quebec would
move closer to the United States economically and might
encourage worker participation in the management of pri
vate enterprise, the provincial government's chief
economic planner says.
"The future for Quebec is in the processing of our raw
material products here, and in many north-south interna
tional exchanges with the United States, especially the East
Coast," said. Bernard Landry, minister of state for economic
development.
Landry is a member of the three-month-old Parti
Quebecois (PQ) government. ThePQ has vowed to lead the
French-speaking province toward independence from the
rest of English-dominated Canada and says it will put the
question to Quebec voters in a referendum.
Economic and cultural concerns are intertwined in the
separatist movement, Landry said in a recent interview.
"In the Quebec tradition the fight against domination has
always linked the two patterns, the cultural and the
economic," he said.

Carter to meet with U.N. ambassador
Plains, Ga. — President Jimmy Carter cut short a
weekend visit to his hometown yesterday to return to
Washington for a meeting with U.N. ambassador Andrew
Young.
The return flight, which was advanced several hours,
followed Young's comments that he thought former Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger had "abandoned" Great Britain
in the efforts aimed at turning over the reins of Rhodesia's
government from the white minority to the black majority
there.
Carter said he thought Young's remarks had been taken
out of context, adding that the ambassador suggested in a
telephone conversation that his 10-day trip to Africa was
successful.
Carter said he did not think Young said it in a critical way.
