# Five spots considered for German, Androgyny houses
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
A University housing committee
named two Row houses and three
Cowell Cluster houses as possible lo
cations for either a German Studies
house or an Androgyny (study of sex
roles) house at its meeting Friday.
The Subcommittee on Residences of
the Committee on Services to Students
(COSS/R) named Jordan House, Whit
man House, Columbae House, ATO
and ZAP as possible locations for the
proposed theme houses. The sub
committee arrived at its decision by
informal consensus; no vote was ta
ken.
"We're not locked in (to these
choices) at all," said Row Director
Karen Murray. "It's possible that other
houses would be chosen."
The Androgyny and German
Studies proposals were approved last
week by the Configuration Advisory
Panel on Housing, but the final deci
sion will come from Acting Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son. He said his decision will be influ
enced by COSS/R's location recom
mendations.
Only Row and Cowell Cluster houses
were considered because both An
drogyny and German Studies Houses
would need their own kitchens.
Residence staffers from the five
houses under consideration will at
tend COSS/R's next meeting on Feb. 22
to explain what their houses are doing
and what affects a change to a theme
house would have.
At the Friday COSS/R meeting, Mur
ray explained why the five houses
should be considered.
Jordan has been plagued with poor
draw statistics in recent years, and six
spaces in the house are presently
empty.
"There is a certain sense of resigna
tion in Jordan that they will be
dumped," Murray told the subcom
mittee.

Informed of Murray's remark, Jordan
House Associate Lisa Dwyer agreed.,
"The house is aware that there's got to
be room for the new houses, and, con
sidering we have the worst record (in
the draw), Jordan is the logical
choice," she said.
"People are not exactly pleased, but
what can they do about it? If the Uni
versity wants to make the decision, no
thing's going to change their mind,"
Dwyer added.
At the meeting, Murray admitted
that Columbae has a fairly well
structured program of political ac
tivities — for example, it is the home of
the Alliance for Radical Change. But
COSS/R members will look into dump
ing Columbae because they suspect
Androgyny House would cut into the
co-op's constituency.
However, in a poll taken at a house
meeting last night, only four of 35 Col
umbae residents said they would leave
Columbae for Androgyny.
Murray said of ATO: "The house is
less well maintained than other self

operated houses on campus. ATO
doesn't seem to have a spirit. It's not
necessarily cliquishness, but I don't
feel the same kind of camaraderie that
the plain old row houses have."
Informed of Murray's comments,
ATO House Manager Margie Hoag re
plied: "The Row Office made an in
spection of ATO at a very bad time. It
was really messy, especially the
kitchen."
Hoag added: "It's frustrating be
cause they claim we're messy, but they
never give us any new stuff. Our furni
ture has holes, our upholstery is torn
up — the lounge is a pit.
' It's hard for the Row Office to per
ceive what kind of spirit a house has,"
Hoag said. "We don't have a theme,
and so any camaraderie we have is less
evident — but I don't think it's
cliquish. I think it's a good house."
As for Whitman, Murray admitted at
the meeting that Whitman has more
"structured program activities" than
the average Row house, but added:
