# IFC arbitration board may be established

### George Anders 
At other campuses, Inter-Fraternity
Councils (IFCs) judge offenders in frat
discipline cases, publish newspapers
about fraternities, set up liquor buying
co-ops, and much more.
Here, the LFC is known for the Bon
fire, the rush book and little else. As
IFC President Jordan Schwartz put it,
"up until recently, individual frater
nities were going their own way."
Changes may be coming, Schwartz
said. The IFC is studying the possibil
ity of establishing an arbitration board
to hear discipline cases involving dif
ferent fraternities.
"The group would serve as an in
termediary body between the Univer
sity and fraternities," Schwartz said.
"It would do fact-finding and make re
commendations, although it would
not have the power to enforce them."
The need for such a body became
clear last spring, he said, when the IFC
could do little in separate vandalism
cases involving Delta Tau Delta and
Zeta Psi fraternities.
The success of an arbitration com
mittee would depend on cooperation
from the student affairs office,
Schwartz said. However, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said yester
day he had received no formal report
about the committee from the IFC.
The committer "could have merit,"
Lyons said, although he said it would
be no substitute for Stanford Judicial
Council hearings. Lyons also said he
was concerned the committee might
cause a double standard of justice with
frat offenders facing different penal

ties from nonfrat offenders.
Theta Xi president Gary Chun said
the idea of an arbitration board sounds
good, but "I'm not sure it's workable."
An IFC committee is currently
studying Title IX of the Education
Amendment of 1972 to see if provi
sions of the act require the University
either to eliminate fraternities or add
sororities, Schwartz said.
The committee will issue a recom
mendation to the Board of Trustees, he
added.
Creating a fraternity liquor co-op
will "take a back seat," Schwartz said.
He asserted that such a co-op would be
impossible since the state Board of Al
coholic Beverage Control is tightly en
forcing provisions against the sale of
alcohol to minors.
A liquor co-op would save frater
nities several thousand dollars, Bob
Ottilie, last year's IFC president, esti
mated.
Many here may prefer a docile IFC.
Only eight of 13 houses were rep
resented at this month's IFC meeting.
"A lot of houses tend to be underin
volved in IFC," Ottilie observed.
"They feel they lose something as a
group."
"I got the impression that there was
some resentment in some houses that
IFC was taking too much of a hand in
rush," Schwartz said.
"My sympathies are with houses
that go their independent ways," Chun
said. "There isn't very much that IFC
can do."

ity of establishing an arbitration board
to hear discipline cases involving dif
ferent fraternities.
"The group would serve as an in
termediary body between the Univer
sity and fraternities," Schwartz said.
"It would do fact-finding and make re
commendations, although it would
not have the power to enforce them."
The need for such a body became
clear last spring, he said, when the IFC
could do little in separate vandalism
cases involving Delta Tau Delta and
Zeta Psi fraternities.
The success of an arbitration com
mittee would depend on cooperation
from the student affairs office,
Schwartz said. However, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said yester
day he had received no formal report
about the committee from the IFC.
The committer "could have merit,"
Lyons said, although he said it would
be no substitute for Stanford Judicial
Council hearings. Lyons also said he
was concerned the committee might
cause a double standard of justice with
frat offenders facing different penal

ties from nonfrat offenders.
Theta Xi president Gary Chun said
the idea of an arbitration board sounds
good, but "I'm not sure it's workable."
An IFC committee is currently
studying Title IX of the Education
Amendment of 1972 to see if provi
sions of the act require the University
either to eliminate fraternities or add
sororities, Schwartz said.
The committee will issue a recom
mendation to the Board of Trustees, he
added.
Creating a fraternity liquor co-op
will "take a back seat," Schwartz said.
He asserted that such a co-op would be
impossible since the state Board of Al
coholic Beverage Control is tightly en
forcing provisions against the sale of
alcohol to minors.
A liquor co-op would save frater
nities several thousand dollars, Bob
Ottilie, last year's IFC president, esti
mated.
Many here may prefer a docile IFC.
Only eight of 13 houses were rep
resented at this month's IFC meeting.
"A lot of houses tend to be underin
volved in IFC," Ottilie observed.
"They feel they lose something as a
group."
"I got the impression that there was
some resentment in some houses that
IFC was taking too much of a hand in
rush," Schwartz said.
"My sympathies are with houses
that go their independent ways," Chun
said. "There isn't very much that IFC
can do."
At other campuses, Inter-Fraternity
Councils (IFCs) judge offenders in frat
discipline cases, publish newspapers
about fraternities, set up liquor buying
co-ops, and much more.
Here, the LFC is known for the Bon
fire, the rush book and little else. As
IFC President Jordan Schwartz put it,
"up until recently, individual frater
nities were going their own way."
Changes may be coming, Schwartz
said. The IFC is studying the possibil
ity of establishing an arbitration board
to hear discipline cases involving dif
ferent fraternities.
