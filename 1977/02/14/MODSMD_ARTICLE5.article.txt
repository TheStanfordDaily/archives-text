## Solar energy: a viable option? 
### Laura Kennedy 
(First of a three-part series on solar energy in the Bay
Area.)
"Solar energy's definitely going to be the wave of the
future," declared Gil Masters, a lecturer in civil en
gineering.
"Yeah, we got our surfboards right outside here," re
plied Harry Whitehouse, acting assistant professor of
mechanical engineering.
The two instructors may joke about solar energy, but
they don't consider it a science fiction novelty to relegate
to the back pages of Popular Mechanics.
No, Masters and Whitehouse, along with two recent
Stanford graduate students, are trying to make money
from solar energy.
Their six-month-old company, Pacific Sun, is a recent
addition to numerous fledgling Bay Area firms that de
sign and install solar-powered pool heaters, home heat
ers and water heaters — occasionally, even solar air
conditioning.
Small volume
Most firms have been in business for only a few years
and volume remains small Bud Amaral, who distributes
solar water heaters for Solaraire in San Jose, and also
installs water-space and pool heaters, estimated that
monthly sales for all Bay Area solar companies average
less than $100,000.
But what Amaral and his fellow solar salesmen are
banking on is a continued rise in the cost of fossil fuel.
The initial cost of a solar system is high — one firm
estimates a ■-oh* e-heating system as high as $12,000.
Pool heating, currently the solar investment with the
quickest payback, averages a wallet-gulping $2000.
The magic number in comparing heating systems is
not the installation cost, but the payback period — that
point at which fuel costs equal a solar system invest
ment.
For example, Masters esti mated the payback period for
solar space heat compared to natural gas heat to be about
37 years — assuming no fuel rate increase. Assuming
fuel price hikes of 10 per cent a year — not unlikely if
natural gas is deregulated — the payback period is re
duced to 13 years.
Estimates of payback periods can vary wildly. Norman
vice president of Western Energy in Palo Alto,

calculated his company's space heating systems will pay
back their $5000 to $6000 cost in 10 years assuming a gas
rate hike of 12 per cent a year.
Yet Amaral estimated a longer payback period — 12 to
14 years — for a space heater costing only $2700 to
$3400.
Having to rely on such "guesstimates" makes poten
tial customers wary of solar energy, but some sources
indicate that solar power can already compete with con
ventional fuels in certain areas.
Energy Research and Development Agency (ERDA)
figures show solar space heating is competitive with
electric heating in every city except Seattle, according to
Whitehouse.
Solar energy makes sense in new construction now,
said Winston Boone, president of Alten Associates, a
Mountain View firm that installs and designs solar sys
tems.
'Worst' conditions
"Every cost estimate by Alten has been conservative,"
added Boone, assuming a 10 to 12 year payback — a
reasonable investment for a new house — even with the
"worst" conditions for solar energy (continued availabil
ity of natural gas and a yearly rate hike of 10 to 12 per
cent.)
Natural gas has been rising at a rate of 20 to 30 percent
a year, said Boone, and he said he thinks its price will
double in 18 months. "If they totally deregulate, it would
just go sky-high right away."
Solar watnr heating and pool heating are generally
considered more economically attractive than space
heating, especially if the California Assembly forbids
use of natural gas for pool heating.
Solar water heaters have been used for years in Israel,
the country from which Michael Majteles imports water
heaters for his Mysun Company in Palo Aito. Majteles,
an Israeli immigrant, estimates a payback period of six to
eight years.
And for pool heaters, the payback time could be as
little as two years, according to Leili McPherson, a
spokesperson for Fafco. a Menlo Park firm that is the
nation's largest manufacturer of plastic solar pool heat
ers.
The City of Santa Clara's pool heaters are already prov
