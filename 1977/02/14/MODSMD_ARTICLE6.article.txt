# Bakke decision: a storm of controversy
## Minority admissions needed 
### 
Jan Neuman

Twenty years ago, few people were
very concerned about the racial dis
crimination inherent in professional
school admissions policies. But in
the late 1960s and early 19705, in re
sponse to the civil rights movement
and ensuing legislation, professional
schools across the country instituted
special admissions programs to in
crease the number of minorities in
their student bodies. There is a flurry
of concern now that the tables have
turned. Reverse discrimination, the
catch phrase for special admissions
policies, has inspired an outcry
among many nonminorities that all
discrimination is unconstitutional
and just plain wrong.
Recently a white male,
Allan Bakke, challenged the program
of the Medical School at the Univer
sity of California at Davis on the same
constitutional grounds — denial of
his rights under the Equal Protection
Clause of the 14th Amendment. The
case eventually came before the
California Supreme Court, often
thought to be one of the country's
most progressive state high courts,
and it was decided in Bakke's favor.
The case has been appealed, and if
the U.S. Supreme Court decides to
hear it, the delicate issue avoided in
De Funis will have to be confronted.
The Bakke decision has created a
furor among administrators, legal
scholars and students, particularly
minorities, who see it as signaling a
dangerous regression in the struggle
for equality.
There is an element of futility in
criticizing the Bakke decision in
legalistic terms. But it's crucial
to state the case for special minority
admissions programs in the wake of
this legal bombshell and a few pre
liminary words about the legal issues
are in order.
First of all, use of race as a special
classification for purpose of admis
sions is not necessarily unconstitu
tional. However, it is the effect of the
special classification on the non
minorities that renders most prog
rams unconstitutional, because it

denies a group a benefit it would
have had except for its race. In order
to avoid this discriminatory effect, a
program would have to eliminate
race as a specific preferential criteria,
or in the alternative, the program
could operate with a number of sub
jective criteria applied to all applic
ants. The latter option would elimi
nate the argument that race was the
only factor that kept a non-minority
applicant out who otherwise met the
objective standards of admission,
such as test scores and CPAs. In other
words, it would eliminate the argu
ment that "less qualified" minorities
are admitted over "qualified" non
minorities.
Secondly, it is possible that even a
program which uses race as a special
classification may stand if it can be
can be proven that the classifying
serves a "compelling state interest"
which cannot be served in any way
less harmful to the group being
excluded.
To get down to substantive attacks,
special minority admissions prog
rams, in some form, are absolutely
necessary to give any credence what
soever to the vision of the 1960s
movement for equal rights. This is
true for a number of reasons. At the
risk of oversimplification of another
complex problem, the idea is one of
breaking into the vicious circle of
discrimination at one of the easier
points of entry.
Increasing the number of minority
students in professional schools is
one important way of breaking the
cycle. Professional minorities can
help to begin new cycles of oppor
tunities and status, not only for the
individuals involved, but also for fu
ture generations. However, if
minorities are held to the same rigid
standards of academic performance
as nonminorities, only a few indi
viduals who have somehow over
come the cycle of past disadvantage
will be admitted.
There are several ways of achiev
ing this goal, possibly some within
the parameters of the Bakke holding.

For instance, the easiest method in
terms of leaving the regular admis
sions policies intact is more recruit
ment of minorities who can meet the
stiff qualifications of most profes
sional schools. This approach has the
obvious advantage of not seeming to
be unconstitutional, but the obvious
disadvantage of not having any effect
on broadening the base of opportun
ity to disadvantaged groups.
Another approach is one that was
mentioned briefly earlier: modifica
tion of the admissions policies so as
to move away from the test score-
GP A bias toward the majority groups.
Of course, this type of system would
be open to abuse, in terms of alio wing
subjective decisions on grounds
other than trying to achieve diver
sity, but if this is the only way to
insure minority admittance, it is cer
tainly a viable alternative.
The real point to be made is this: if
we as a society cannot figure out
some way to surmount the possible
death blow of the Bakke decision on
special admissions programs, we
will suffer a terrible setback in the
area of human rights and equal op
portunity.
If a society that purports to be
democratic and "equal" cannot find
its way out of this tricky legal and
constitutional dilemma and put its
preaching into practice, then we
have denigrated the dream of the past
two decades.

most progressive state high courts,
and it was decided in Bakke's favor.
The case has been appealed, and if
the U.S. Supreme Court decides to
hear it, the delicate issue avoided in
De Funis will have to be confronted.
The Bakke decision has created a
furor among administrators, legal
scholars and students, particularly
minorities, who see it as signaling a
dangerous regression in the struggle
for equality.
There is an element of futility in
criticizing the Bakke decision in
legalistic terms. But it's crucial
to state the case for special minority
admissions programs in the wake of
this legal bombshell and a few pre
liminary words about the legal issues
are in order.
First of all, use of race as a special
classification for purpose of admis
sions is not necessarily unconstitu
tional. However, it is the effect of the
special classification on the non
minorities that renders most prog
rams unconstitutional, because it

denies a group a benefit it would
have had except for its race. In order
to avoid this discriminatory effect, a
program would have to eliminate
race as a specific preferential criteria,
or in the alternative, the program
could operate with a number of sub
jective criteria applied to all applic
ants. The latter option would elimi
nate the argument that race was the
only factor that kept a non-minority
applicant out who otherwise met the
objective standards of admission,
such as test scores and CPAs. In other
words, it would eliminate the argu
ment that "less qualified" minorities
are admitted over "qualified" non
minorities.
Secondly, it is possible that even a
program which uses race as a special
classification may stand if it can be
can be proven that the classifying
serves a "compelling state interest"
which cannot be served in any way
less harmful to the group being
excluded.
To get down to substantive attacks,
special minority admissions prog
rams, in some form, are absolutely
necessary to give any credence what
soever to the vision of the 1960s
movement for equal rights. This is
true for a number of reasons. At the
risk of oversimplification of another
complex problem, the idea is one of
breaking into the vicious circle of
discrimination at one of the easier
points of entry.
Increasing the number of minority
students in professional schools is
one important way of breaking the
cycle. Professional minorities can
help to begin new cycles of oppor
tunities and status, not only for the
individuals involved, but also for fu
ture generations. However, if
minorities are held to the same rigid
standards of academic performance
as nonminorities, only a few indi
viduals who have somehow over
come the cycle of past disadvantage
will be admitted.
There are several ways of achiev
ing this goal, possibly some within
the parameters of the Bakke holding.

For instance, the easiest method in
terms of leaving the regular admis
sions policies intact is more recruit
ment of minorities who can meet the
stiff qualifications of most profes
sional schools. This approach has the
obvious advantage of not seeming to
be unconstitutional, but the obvious
disadvantage of not having any effect
on broadening the base of opportun
ity to disadvantaged groups.
Another approach is one that was
mentioned briefly earlier: modifica
tion of the admissions policies so as
to move away from the test score-
GP A bias toward the majority groups.
Of course, this type of system would
be open to abuse, in terms of alio wing
subjective decisions on grounds
other than trying to achieve diver
sity, but if this is the only way to
insure minority admittance, it is cer
tainly a viable alternative.
The real point to be made is this: if
we as a society cannot figure out
some way to surmount the possible
death blow of the Bakke decision on
special admissions programs, we
will suffer a terrible setback in the
area of human rights and equal op
portunity.
If a society that purports to be
democratic and "equal" cannot find
its way out of this tricky legal and
constitutional dilemma and put its
preaching into practice, then we
have denigrated the dream of the past
two decades.

Twenty years ago, few people were
very concerned about the racial dis
crimination inherent in professional
school admissions policies. But in
the late 1960s and early 19705, in re
sponse to the civil rights movement
and ensuing legislation, professional
schools across the country instituted
special admissions programs to in
crease the number of minorities in
their student bodies. There is a flurry
of concern now that the tables have
turned. Reverse discrimination, the
catch phrase for special admissions
policies, has inspired an outcry
among many nonminorities that all
discrimination is unconstitutional
and just plain wrong.
Recently a white male,
Allan Bakke, challenged the program
of the Medical School at the Univer
sity of California at Davis on the same
constitutional grounds — denial of
his rights under the Equal Protection
Clause of the 14th Amendment. The
case eventually came before the
California Supreme Court, often

Twenty years ago, few people were
very concerned about the racial dis
crimination inherent in professional
school admissions policies. But in
the late 1960s and early 19705, in re
sponse to the civil rights movement
and ensuing legislation, professional
schools across the country instituted
special admissions programs to in
crease the number of minorities in
their student bodies. There is a flurry
of concern now that the tables have
turned. Reverse discrimination, the
catch phrase for special admissions
policies, has inspired an outcry
among many nonminorities that all
discrimination is unconstitutional
and just plain wrong.
Recently a white male,
Allan Bakke, challenged the program
of the Medical School at the Univer
sity of California at Davis on the same
constitutional grounds — denial of
his rights under the Equal Protection
Clause of the 14th Amendment. The
case eventually came before the
California Supreme Court, often
thought to be one of the country's
most progressive state high courts,
and it was decided in Bakke's favor.
The case has been appealed, and if
the U.S. Supreme Court decides to
hear it, the delicate issue avoided in
De Funis will have to be confronted.
The Bakke decision has created a
furor among administrators, legal
scholars and students, particularly
minorities, who see it as signaling a
dangerous regression in the struggle
for equality.
There is an element of futility in
criticizing the Bakke decision in
legalistic terms. But it's crucial
to state the case for special minority
admissions programs in the wake of
this legal bombshell and a few pre
liminary words about the legal issues
are in order.
First of all, use of race as a special
classification for purpose of admis
sions is not necessarily unconstitu
tional. However, it is the effect of the
special classification on the non
minorities that renders most prog
rams unconstitutional, because it

denies a group a benefit it would
have had except for its race. In order
to avoid this discriminatory effect, a
program would have to eliminate
race as a specific preferential criteria,
or in the alternative, the program
could operate with a number of sub
jective criteria applied to all applic
ants. The latter option would elimi
nate the argument that race was the
only factor that kept a non-minority
applicant out who otherwise met the
objective standards of admission,
such as test scores and CPAs. In other
words, it would eliminate the argu
ment that "less qualified" minorities
are admitted over "qualified" non
minorities.

classification may stand if it can be

serves a "compelling state interest"
which cannot be served in any way
less harmful to the group being
excluded.
