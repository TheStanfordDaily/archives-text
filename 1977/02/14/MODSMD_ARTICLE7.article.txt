Any across-the-board evaluation of
teaching which does not take fully into
account the profoundly qualitative
dimension — for example the deep
changes in and lasting effect on a few
who respond with something like total
sympathy to a truly generous and mas
terly presentation — will be destruc
tive of the purposes of higher educa
tion.
If history tells us anything, it is that
the superbly innovative or excellent
arouses hostility initially in the mass,
even the educated or academic mass.
Only an enlightened administration
can protect this kind of performance in
the university, ultimately. But if the
ASSIJ Senate considers a mandatory
universal evaluation system, it surely

ought to be aware of the creeping peril
which would result from giving undue
importance to "crowd-pleasing."
There are ways to minimize this
danger: consult former students as
well, especially those who have gone
on in their teacher's field; provide a
qualitative weighting method, asking
a student to rate his particular com
mitment to the teacher's field or
branch of it.
If this is elaborate, it is because the
whole affair is tricky, as responsible
people have always known, and calls
for extraordinary understanding and
experience.
