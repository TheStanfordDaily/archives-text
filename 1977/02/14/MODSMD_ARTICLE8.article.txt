## Opinions Barnraising in Bovina, Kansas 
### 
It is with much concern that I look
upon the number of construction jobs
that have cropped up on campus
within the past six months. Since I was
away at an overseas campus last quar
ter (Stanford-in-Mayberry, North
Carolina), I was not here to view the
preliminary setting up of cyclone
fences and whatnot that always pre
ceeds a construction job. (My theory
being that these fences are erected to
prevent passers-by from seeing that
the workmen are actually in there
playing a game of touch football or
bocci.) Needless to say, I was shocked
to return to the Farm and find it looked
like Bovina, Kansas, in preparation for
a twister. Other students who had just
returned from a quarter away must
have been equally confused, for I
found no less than four students who
had accidentally bicycled into a con
struction ditch and were proceeding to
hold their undergraduate special
there.
I stopped my bike at the cyclone
fence currently dividing Galvez Street
and called to one of the construction
workers to find out the why's and

who's of what was going on. (He did
not seem to mind that I interrupted
their game of touch football.)
"Well," he said to me in a gruff
voice, the sweat glistening off his mas
sive tattoos like rhinestones, "we're
addin' on something to your main lib
rary here."

"But WHY?!," I demanded, grab
bing him by the arm.
No sooner was 1 able to cough up his
hard hat when a foreman jogged over to
tell me not to bother the workers. And
that is why I am writing this opinion, a
copy of which will be mailed to my
congressman and Bella Abzug's

gynecologist.
Why? Why all the new edifices?
And all being constructed at the same
time. I surely don't have to go into the
old why don't we use some of this
funding to solve the undergraduate
housing problem argument. However I
will voice my concern for the future
and what this rash of construction will
mean for the people who must live on
this campus.
According to my calculations, if the
rate of construction proceeds with the
same vigor that it has over the past six
months, by the time I graduate, 93 per
cent of Stanford's campus will be oc
cupied by construction-related items.
This will mean the following:
—the commencement speaker in the
spring of '78 will have to scale three
cyclone fences to get to the speaker's
platform at the base of Frost amphithe
ater. In addition, he will be required to
wear safety glasses while making that
speech.
—those who bicycle at night will be
required to wear lights, in the form of a
miner's helmet.
—there will be so many buildings

here, the married couple that sel Is fruit
by the bookstore will occupy their own
three story structure: the Anita
Bryant Center for Fruit Marketing Re
search.
—all dogs that roam around on cam
pus will be required to wear hiking
shoes with Vibram soles to protect
them from discarded nails and other
construction-related refuse.
—instead of freshman English, all
incoming students will be required to
take Undergraduate Special 381 enti
tled "Intermediate Running From
Psychopathic Forklift Operators."
Now 1 would be quite flattered if
President Lyman called me on the
phone and told me that this article
convinced him to put a halt to all con
struction. However, I will not hold my
breath for that phone call. As a matter
of fact, I hope that the amount of con
struction on campus is actually in
creased. Soon enough buildings will
so crowd this place that we will be able
to turnthewhole area into a shopping
mall.

tell me not to bother the workers. And
that is why I am writing this opinion, a
copy of which will be mailed to my
congressman and Bella Abzug's

gynecologist.
Why? Why all the new edifices?
And all being constructed at the same
time. I surely don't have to go into the
old why don't we use some of this
funding to solve the undergraduate
housing problem argument. However I
will voice my concern for the future
and what this rash of construction will
mean for the people who must live on
this campus.
According to my calculations, if the
rate of construction proceeds with the
same vigor that it has over the past six
months, by the time I graduate, 93 per
cent of Stanford's campus will be oc
cupied by construction-related items.
This will mean the following:
—the commencement speaker in the
spring of '78 will have to scale three
cyclone fences to get to the speaker's
platform at the base of Frost amphithe
ater. In addition, he will be required to
wear safety glasses while making that
speech.
—those who bicycle at night will be
required to wear lights, in the form of a
miner's helmet.
—there will be so many buildings

here, the married couple that sel Is fruit
by the bookstore will occupy their own
three story structure: the Anita
Bryant Center for Fruit Marketing Re
search.
—all dogs that roam around on cam
pus will be required to wear hiking
shoes with Vibram soles to protect
them from discarded nails and other
construction-related refuse.
—instead of freshman English, all
incoming students will be required to
take Undergraduate Special 381 enti
tled "Intermediate Running From
Psychopathic Forklift Operators."
Now 1 would be quite flattered if
President Lyman called me on the
phone and told me that this article
convinced him to put a halt to all con
struction. However, I will not hold my
breath for that phone call. As a matter
of fact, I hope that the amount of con
struction on campus is actually in
creased. Soon enough buildings will
so crowd this place that we will be able
to turnthewhole area into a shopping
mall.

It is with much concern that I look
upon the number of construction jobs
that have cropped up on campus
within the past six months. Since I was
away at an overseas campus last quar
ter (Stanford-in-Mayberry, North
Carolina), I was not here to view the
preliminary setting up of cyclone
fences and whatnot that always pre
ceeds a construction job. (My theory
being that these fences are erected to
prevent passers-by from seeing that
the workmen are actually in there
playing a game of touch football or
bocci.) Needless to say, I was shocked
to return to the Farm and find it looked
like Bovina, Kansas, in preparation for
a twister. Other students who had just
returned from a quarter away must
have been equally confused, for I
found no less than four students who
had accidentally bicycled into a con
struction ditch and were proceeding to
hold their undergraduate special
there.
I stopped my bike at the cyclone
fence currently dividing Galvez Street
and called to one of the construction
workers to find out the why's and

who's of what was going on. (He did
not seem to mind that I interrupted
their game of touch football.)
"Well," he said to me in a gruff
voice, the sweat glistening off his mas
sive tattoos like rhinestones, "we're
addin' on something to your main lib
rary here."

"But WHY?!," I demanded, grab
bing him by the arm.
No sooner was 1 able to cough up his
hard hat when a foreman jogged over to
tell me not to bother the workers. And
that is why I am writing this opinion, a
copy of which will be mailed to my
congressman and Bella Abzug's

gynecologist.
