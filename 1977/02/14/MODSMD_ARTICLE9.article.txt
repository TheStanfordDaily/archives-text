# Stop reverse discrimination

The recent 6-1 decision of the
California Supreme Court in Bakke
has agsin revived the issue of reverse
discrimination, which was sidestep
ped by the U.S. Supreme Court in a
5-4 decision in 1973 in De Funis. In
Bakke, 16 spaces out of 100 were
guaranteed for minority applicants to
the medical school through a special
admissions committee. In De Funis,
approximately 20 per cent of the pos
itions were filled by "minority" (ar
bitrarily defined) applicants, without
regard to non-minority applicants.
Neither of these cases attacked af
firmative action programs. Rather,
they deal with the use of discrimina
tion ("in reverse") as a method to
achieve the worthy goals of affirma
tive action. Even most proponents
admit, as was recognized by the
Northern District (Federal) Court in
Anderson (1972), that "Preferential
treatment under the guise of 'affirma
tive action' is the imposition of one
form of racism in place of another."
The question is then whether the use
of discrimination, rather than other
methods, is justified.
Some proponents argue that re
verse discrimination is not noxious,
as was the discrimination it is seek
ing to rectify. This contention is most
disturbing, however, because it reeks
of some subtle notions of racism it
self. Certainly any discrimination is
evil — the question is only whether
there is some justification.
It is then suggested that given that
reverse discrimination is both unde

sirable and discriminatory, it is still
morally "right" as a redress to past
wrongs. This does, however, require
a unique interpretation of the Con
stitution. Surely, as in the words of
former Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam O. Douglas (in his dissent in De
Funis in 1973), "There is noconstitu
tional right for any race to be prefer
red." And as the majority in Bakke
found, the Equal Protection Clause,
"by its literal terms applies to 'any
person.' "
Under the former view, only
minorities (or more accurately, for
anyone who happened to be desig
nated as a "minority"), and not the
"majority" (actually the arbitrarily
designated collection of "non
minorities") would be entitled to its
protection. This arbitrary selection is
quite capricious. For example, in De
Funis, Asian Americans were not
considered a minority. What would
be the basis for protection under the
constitution? Whether the approp
riate authority considered you to be a
"minority?"
In Bakke, the university justified
its policy on the basis of increasing
the number of minority doctors, so as
to produce doctors with a greater
rapport with minority communities
and with a greater interest in treating
their prevalent diseases. The major
ity accurately cited "as eloquent refu
tation Justice Douglas in De Funis:
'The Equal Protection Clause com
mands the elimination of racial bar
riers, not their creation in order to
satisfy our theory as to how society
ought to be organized. The purpose
of the University of Washington can
not be to produce black lawyers for
blacks, Polish lawyers for P01e5,....
It should be to produce good lawyers
for Americans
A more pragmatic concern is that
reverse discrimination wrongly de
preciates the accomplishments of
any member of such a minority, no
matter how gifted they may be. As the
majority in Bakke suggest, "The
overemphasis upon race will un
doubtedly be counterproductive: re
wards and penalties, achievements
and failures, are likely to be consi
dered in a racial context through the
school years and beyond."
In fact, ". . . human nature suggests
a preferred minority will be no more
willing than others to relinquish an
advantage once it is bestowed.
Perhaps most important, the princi
ples that the constitution sanctions
racial discrimination against a race
— any race — is a dangerous concept
fraught with potential for misuse in
situations which involve far less

laudable objectives than are manifest
in the present case."
But proponents then argue that,
even if a "constitutional right to have
one's application considered on its
individual merits in a racially neutral
manner (Justice Douglas) exists, and
that there are dangers of misuse, that
this right must be overriden and dan
gers accepted for the objectives of af
firmative action. They suggest that
society must be racially conscious in
the short-run, to be color-blind in the
long run."
However, this line of reasoning
fails to take into account that the
Equal Protection Clause "did not
enact a requirement that law schools
employ as the sole criterion for ad
missions a formula based upon the
LSAT and undergraduate grades, nor
does it prohibit law schools from
evaluating an applicant's prior
achievements in light of the barriers
that he had to overcome (Justice
Douglas, De Funis)."
Thus the solution, though perhaps
more complicated, lies in making de
cisions on the basis of individual at
tributes, rather than on the basis of
race. Disadvantaged students should
be identified and recruited, and re
medial training provided, if neces
sary. But most important, cultural
backgrounds and perceptions should
be considered. In short, one should
look at "prior achievements in light
of the racial discrimination that bar
red his way, as a factor in attempting
to assess his true potential (Justice
Douglas, De Funis)."
Racial discrimination has etched
inequity and inequality across
America, and major efforts are
needed to remedy its pernicious ef
fects. But discriminating anew to re
ctify past wrongs is not justified, or
necessary. As Justice Douglas noted,
"If discrimination based on race is
constitutionally permissible when
those who hold the reins can come up
with 'compelling' reasons to justify
it, then constitutional guarantees ac
quire an accordionlike quality."
Individuals should be treated as
individuals — which does not mean
the abandonment of efforts to rectify
past wrongs. Rather, we need to rec
ognize the fundamental right to be
considered in light of ones' own ex
periences and achievements. Cer
tainly Chief Justice Hale of the
Washington Supreme Court was cor
rect when he noted that "the crisis of
inequality cannot be broken by shift
ing the inequities from one man to
another."

itions were filled by "minority" (ar
bitrarily defined) applicants, without
regard to non-minority applicants.
Neither of these cases attacked af
firmative action programs. Rather,
they deal with the use of discrimina
tion ("in reverse") as a method to
achieve the worthy goals of affirma
tive action. Even most proponents
admit, as was recognized by the
Northern District (Federal) Court in
Anderson (1972), that "Preferential
treatment under the guise of 'affirma
tive action' is the imposition of one
form of racism in place of another."
The question is then whether the use
of discrimination, rather than other
methods, is justified.
Some proponents argue that re
verse discrimination is not noxious,
as was the discrimination it is seek
ing to rectify. This contention is most
disturbing, however, because it reeks
of some subtle notions of racism it
self. Certainly any discrimination is
evil — the question is only whether
there is some justification.
It is then suggested that given that
reverse discrimination is both unde

sirable and discriminatory, it is still
morally "right" as a redress to past
wrongs. This does, however, require
a unique interpretation of the Con
stitution. Surely, as in the words of
former Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam O. Douglas (in his dissent in De
Funis in 1973), "There is noconstitu
tional right for any race to be prefer
red." And as the majority in Bakke
found, the Equal Protection Clause,
"by its literal terms applies to 'any
person.' "
Under the former view, only
minorities (or more accurately, for
anyone who happened to be desig
nated as a "minority"), and not the
"majority" (actually the arbitrarily
designated collection of "non
minorities") would be entitled to its
protection. This arbitrary selection is
quite capricious. For example, in De
Funis, Asian Americans were not
considered a minority. What would
be the basis for protection under the
constitution? Whether the approp
riate authority considered you to be a
"minority?"
In Bakke, the university justified
its policy on the basis of increasing
the number of minority doctors, so as
to produce doctors with a greater
rapport with minority communities
and with a greater interest in treating
their prevalent diseases. The major
ity accurately cited "as eloquent refu
tation Justice Douglas in De Funis:
'The Equal Protection Clause com
mands the elimination of racial bar
riers, not their creation in order to
satisfy our theory as to how society
ought to be organized. The purpose
of the University of Washington can
not be to produce black lawyers for
blacks, Polish lawyers for P01e5,....
It should be to produce good lawyers
for Americans
A more pragmatic concern is that
reverse discrimination wrongly de
preciates the accomplishments of
any member of such a minority, no
matter how gifted they may be. As the
majority in Bakke suggest, "The
overemphasis upon race will un
doubtedly be counterproductive: re
wards and penalties, achievements
and failures, are likely to be consi
dered in a racial context through the
school years and beyond."
In fact, ". . . human nature suggests
a preferred minority will be no more
willing than others to relinquish an
advantage once it is bestowed.
Perhaps most important, the princi
ples that the constitution sanctions
racial discrimination against a race
— any race — is a dangerous concept
fraught with potential for misuse in
situations which involve far less

laudable objectives than are manifest
in the present case."
But proponents then argue that,
even if a "constitutional right to have
one's application considered on its
individual merits in a racially neutral
manner (Justice Douglas) exists, and
that there are dangers of misuse, that
this right must be overriden and dan
gers accepted for the objectives of af
firmative action. They suggest that
society must be racially conscious in
the short-run, to be color-blind in the
long run."
However, this line of reasoning
fails to take into account that the
Equal Protection Clause "did not
enact a requirement that law schools
employ as the sole criterion for ad
missions a formula based upon the
LSAT and undergraduate grades, nor
does it prohibit law schools from
evaluating an applicant's prior
achievements in light of the barriers
that he had to overcome (Justice
Douglas, De Funis)."
Thus the solution, though perhaps
more complicated, lies in making de
cisions on the basis of individual at
tributes, rather than on the basis of
race. Disadvantaged students should
be identified and recruited, and re
medial training provided, if neces
sary. But most important, cultural
backgrounds and perceptions should
be considered. In short, one should
look at "prior achievements in light
of the racial discrimination that bar
red his way, as a factor in attempting
to assess his true potential (Justice
Douglas, De Funis)."
Racial discrimination has etched
inequity and inequality across
America, and major efforts are
needed to remedy its pernicious ef
fects. But discriminating anew to re
ctify past wrongs is not justified, or
necessary. As Justice Douglas noted,
"If discrimination based on race is
constitutionally permissible when
those who hold the reins can come up
with 'compelling' reasons to justify
it, then constitutional guarantees ac
quire an accordionlike quality."
Individuals should be treated as
individuals — which does not mean
the abandonment of efforts to rectify
past wrongs. Rather, we need to rec
ognize the fundamental right to be
considered in light of ones' own ex
periences and achievements. Cer
tainly Chief Justice Hale of the
Washington Supreme Court was cor
rect when he noted that "the crisis of
inequality cannot be broken by shift
ing the inequities from one man to
another."

treatment under the guise of 'affirma
tive action' is the imposition of one
form of racism in place of another."
The question is then whether the use
of discrimination, rather than other
methods, is justified.
Some proponents argue that re
verse discrimination is not noxious,
as was the discrimination it is seek
ing to rectify. This contention is most
disturbing, however, because it reeks
of some subtle notions of racism it
self. Certainly any discrimination is
evil — the question is only whether
there is some justification.
It is then suggested that given that
reverse discrimination is both unde

sirable and discriminatory, it is still
morally "right" as a redress to past
wrongs. This does, however, require
a unique interpretation of the Con
stitution. Surely, as in the words of
former Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam O. Douglas (in his dissent in De
Funis in 1973), "There is noconstitu
tional right for any race to be prefer
red." And as the majority in Bakke
found, the Equal Protection Clause,
"by its literal terms applies to 'any
person.' "
Under the former view, only
minorities (or more accurately, for
anyone who happened to be desig
nated as a "minority"), and not the
"majority" (actually the arbitrarily
designated collection of "non
minorities") would be entitled to its
protection. This arbitrary selection is
quite capricious. For example, in De
Funis, Asian Americans were not
considered a minority. What would
be the basis for protection under the
constitution? Whether the approp
riate authority considered you to be a
"minority?"
In Bakke, the university justified
its policy on the basis of increasing
the number of minority doctors, so as
to produce doctors with a greater
rapport with minority communities
and with a greater interest in treating
their prevalent diseases. The major
ity accurately cited "as eloquent refu
tation Justice Douglas in De Funis:
'The Equal Protection Clause com
mands the elimination of racial bar
riers, not their creation in order to
satisfy our theory as to how society
ought to be organized. The purpose
of the University of Washington can
not be to produce black lawyers for
blacks, Polish lawyers for P01e5,....
It should be to produce good lawyers
for Americans
A more pragmatic concern is that
reverse discrimination wrongly de
preciates the accomplishments of
any member of such a minority, no
matter how gifted they may be. As the
majority in Bakke suggest, "The
overemphasis upon race will un
doubtedly be counterproductive: re
wards and penalties, achievements
and failures, are likely to be consi
dered in a racial context through the
school years and beyond."
In fact, ". . . human nature suggests
a preferred minority will be no more
willing than others to relinquish an
advantage once it is bestowed.
Perhaps most important, the princi
ples that the constitution sanctions
racial discrimination against a race
— any race — is a dangerous concept
fraught with potential for misuse in
situations which involve far less

laudable objectives than are manifest
in the present case."
But proponents then argue that,
even if a "constitutional right to have
one's application considered on its
individual merits in a racially neutral
manner (Justice Douglas) exists, and
that there are dangers of misuse, that
this right must be overriden and dan
gers accepted for the objectives of af
firmative action. They suggest that
society must be racially conscious in
the short-run, to be color-blind in the
long run."
However, this line of reasoning
fails to take into account that the
Equal Protection Clause "did not
enact a requirement that law schools
employ as the sole criterion for ad
missions a formula based upon the
LSAT and undergraduate grades, nor
does it prohibit law schools from
evaluating an applicant's prior
achievements in light of the barriers
that he had to overcome (Justice
Douglas, De Funis)."
Thus the solution, though perhaps
more complicated, lies in making de
cisions on the basis of individual at
tributes, rather than on the basis of
race. Disadvantaged students should
be identified and recruited, and re
medial training provided, if neces
sary. But most important, cultural
backgrounds and perceptions should
be considered. In short, one should
look at "prior achievements in light
of the racial discrimination that bar
red his way, as a factor in attempting
to assess his true potential (Justice
Douglas, De Funis)."
Racial discrimination has etched
inequity and inequality across
America, and major efforts are
needed to remedy its pernicious ef
fects. But discriminating anew to re
ctify past wrongs is not justified, or
necessary. As Justice Douglas noted,
"If discrimination based on race is
constitutionally permissible when
those who hold the reins can come up
with 'compelling' reasons to justify
it, then constitutional guarantees ac
quire an accordionlike quality."
Individuals should be treated as
individuals — which does not mean
the abandonment of efforts to rectify
past wrongs. Rather, we need to rec
ognize the fundamental right to be
considered in light of ones' own ex
periences and achievements. Cer
tainly Chief Justice Hale of the
Washington Supreme Court was cor
rect when he noted that "the crisis of
inequality cannot be broken by shift
ing the inequities from one man to
another."

The recent 6-1 decision of the
California Supreme Court in Bakke
has agsin revived the issue of reverse
discrimination, which was sidestep
ped by the U.S. Supreme Court in a
5-4 decision in 1973 in De Funis. In
Bakke, 16 spaces out of 100 were
guaranteed for minority applicants to
the medical school through a special
admissions committee. In De Funis,
approximately 20 per cent of the pos
itions were filled by "minority" (ar
bitrarily defined) applicants, without
regard to non-minority applicants.
Neither of these cases attacked af
firmative action programs. Rather,
they deal with the use of discrimina
tion ("in reverse") as a method to
achieve the worthy goals of affirma
tive action. Even most proponents
