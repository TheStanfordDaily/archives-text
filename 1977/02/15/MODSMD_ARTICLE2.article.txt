# Developing the picture of Kirlian photography
## Captured light from another dimension?

We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

kin and Michael Schacter
used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i

duced in intensity while

more coherent.
than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.

The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his

tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip

In February 1973 he wrote,

of the Mediterranean and built ships

era's harbingers who non-plus the

In February 1973 he wrote,

The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors

psychics and clairvoyants have long

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.

can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo

the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as

a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.

it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."

as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

kin and Michael Schacter
used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i
fore treatment (left) the

quently fragmented or re
duced in intensity while

more coherent.
than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob

graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

kin and Michael Schacter
used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i
fore treatment (left) the

duced in intensity while

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

kin and Michael Schacter
used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i
fore treatment (left) the

quently fragmented or re
duced in intensity while

more coherent.
than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
The class of phenomena com
monly labeled "psychic" has
heretofore received little serious at
tention from the western scientific
establishment. This is at least in part
attributable to the generally non
rigorous methodology of psychic
researchers.
In March, 1973, Tiller wrote of
the need for "readouts that are
meaningful to the conventional sci
entific community.
"We have to do that at this point
in time," he said. "We must bring
the data to that level."
The particular phenomena to
which these words refer is an in
teraction between life, an electrical
field and a light recording device
known as Kirlian photography.
From its invention 38 years ago
in the Soviet Union to the present
day, psychic researchers on all
levels of seriousness have held

to diagnose a person's state of
health? Was this the astral body —
the luminescent body of energy
which psychics say we all have?"
If so, skeptical scientists would be
forced to take the concept seriously:
photographs are solid evidence in a
"seeing is believing" world. It was
hoped that rigorous experiments
based on the Kirlian process would
yield the positive and reproducible
results crucial for scientific accep
tance.
Optimism ran high as Soviet sci
entists such as Vladimir Inyushin
unequivocally equated as late as
1971 the "bioplasma body" re
vealed in Kirlian photographs with
the human aura.
Ostrander and Schroeder con
cluded in 1970, "Semyon
Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina
Chrisanfovna Kirlian had created a
way for us to see the unseeable But

" \ . they set the world of Soviet science on the
track of some truly awesome discoveries about
the nature of man.' "

great hope that Kirlian photography
would prove to be the vehicle which
would conduct them into the realm
of conventional science. Many ob
servers versed in the language of
psychic phenomena interpreted the
brilliant light patterns first photo
graphed by the Krasnodarian elec
trician Semyon Davidovich Kirlian
as a manifestation of the human
"aura."
"Was it the 'aura' they were se
eing?" Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder ask in their book
PsychicDiscoueries behind the
Iron Curtain.
Was it "that envelope of colors
surrounding the body which
psychics and clairvoyants have long
claimed to see and which they use

what did it mean — this maze of
colored energy within us? Now they
set the world of Soviet science on
the track of some truly awesome
discoveries about the nature of
man. The Kirlians' 'window on the
unknown' might revolutionize our
entire concept of ourselves and our
universe. It seems they had disco
vered far more than the aura."

Over the course of its 30 year
career, Kirlian photography
has compiled a fascinating and im
pressive dossier of experimental re
sults.
Ostrander and Schroeder report
that Kirlian and his wife "examined
every conceivable substance under
their high-frequency microscope —

leather, metal, wood, leaves, paper,
coins, rubber. The pattern of
luminescence was different for
every item, but living things had to
tally different structural details than
non-living things. A metal coin, for
instance, showed only a completely
even glow all around the edges. But
a living leaf was made up of millions
of sparkling lights that glowed and
glittered like jewels."
Some three decades after this ini
tial research, Tiller spent two weeks
in the Soviet Union talking with sci
entists and reviewing subsequent
investigations of the Kirlian
phenomena. In his article "Energy
Fields and the Human Body," Tiller
summed up the most intriguing as
pects of the Soviet investigations.
"Using these devices for visual
monitoring of the energy patterns,
the Russians find that energy flares
emerge from certain points of the
skin, and that the flare color and
intensity is directly correlated with
the emotional or mental, as well as
physical, condition of the body, i.e.,
with fatigue, stress, nervousness,
sleep, disease, etc. With leaves, they
have been able to detect disease
before it is manifest at the physical
level and is detectable by conven
tional instruments. They also find
that there is a 1:1 correlation bet
ween the major flare points and the
acupunture points that are known
from the ancient Chinese method
of healing.
"Using a transparent electrode
device, they have photographed
the palm of a healer's hands in the
process of projecting healing
energy to a patient. They find that,
as he is warming up, many points of
the palm are flaring. As he becomes

more attuned, the number of flare
points decreases, and the area of
discharge around any flare point in
creases. Eventually, the condition is
reached where one sees only a bril
liant luminescent disc (about the
size of a dime) in the center of the
palm. This is when the healer is
completely attuned and when the
patient says that he feels energy (or
heat) in his body,' the article states.
In the same article. Tiller de
scribes the Russians' dramatic
"phantom leaf" experiments in
which a Kirlian photograph of a leaf
which has had a section removed
shows an energy pattern resembl
ing that of a whole leaf.
"This energy manifestation from
the absent portion of the leaf is of
great importance, Tiller com
mented, "because it suggests that
we are not only receiving energy

from the physical substance but
from some other level of sub
stance."
Despite the late start of American
investigators in the Kirlian field,
their experiments are remarkable
for their diversity if nothing else.
Four years ago a team of resear
chers claimed success in predicting
the onset of illness up to 24 hours
before any conventionally detecta
ble symptons were noted in the sub
jects.
At about the same time two
psychiatrists reported marked
changes in the fingerpad patterns of
mentally disturbed patients before
and after treatment.
A 1975 study of fingerpad pat
terns found that halo size was linked
to interpersonal interactions bet
ween experimenter and subject.
The investigators found that larger

used Kirlian photography to
investigate energy changes
in a group of schizophrenics
and a group of alcoholics
undergoing treatment. Be- i

than average halos are produced
when the experimenter and subject
have a mutually positive relation
ship. Large halos were produced by
a subject of the opposite sex from
the experimenter, for example, but
if a male experimenter was overtly
seductive, the female subject's
halo tended to be smaller than av
erage.

The original photographic ap
paratus employed by
Kirlian and his wife is considera
bly less complex than many con
ventional cameras in use today.
With only a power source, an elec
trode pair and photographic film
requisite, the Kiriians found they
were able to photograph a great
variety of objects. The different
physical and electrical characteris
tics of, for example, a leaf and a
human being, led to the develop
ment of two basic techniques. An
object with the inherent capacity to
act as an electrical ground (such as a
finger attached to a human being),
can act as one of the electrodes, so
that it is possible to take a photo
graph with the finger resting lightly
on a sheet of film which is itself on
the other electrode.
An object which is not so easily

grounded, such as a detached leaf,
requires a ham-and-cheese
sandwich-type arrangement with
the two electrodes acting as bread,
the leaf as cheese and the film as
ham.
In both cases, once the film and
the subject have been placed on the
apparatus in the dark, a short pulse
of high voltage electricity from the
power source, comparable to the
flash from a flashbulb, causes the
light patterns and colors to appear
on the film.
The Soviets have developed
several instruments which extend
the capabilities of the Kirlian pro
cess. One of the most important,
the transparent electrode, elimi
nates the need for film since the
light patterns between the subject
and the electrode can be seen
through the electrode directly by
eye.
Another device permits a 400
fold magnification of the light pal
tern which can then be projected by
a television-like cathode ray tube.
Possibly the most sophisticated
Kirlian device in existence has been
developed by Tiller and electrical
engineering graduate students
Doug ModHn and Ed Young. Their
instrument provides precise

monitoring and control of the pro
cess' electrical parameters with a
computer built by Modbn. The sys
tem has great potential, according
to Modlin, but has only recently
been completed so no real work
with it has begun.

<(T had thought we'd break
1 through," Tiller said
recently looking back at
his six years of work with Kirlian

the universe. However, after a year
or two's experience with high
voltage photography in the United
States, it is now time to ask ourse
lves some serious questions con
cerning the process: Does the evi
dence show that we are dealing
here with physical or what we might
for the moment call non-physical
effects? Can we realistically account
for the observations made to date
with a specific model? Are we doing

"It was tempting to believe that the brilliant hues
of Kirlian photographs bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the subject

photography. "There's still a
chance that we'll break through but
somehow it feels as if it will be diffe
rent. I think it will be a quiet kind of
thing."
In 1971 Tiller's long-standing in
terest in the field of pyschic
phenomena climaxed in a visit to
the Soviet Union with a small group
from the Association for Research
and Enlightenment.
"1 came back feeling very much
as if I wanted to go forward,"he
recalled. He started experimenting
with Kirlian photography in
November, 1971 and in the follow
ing months made great strides in the
field.
After a year's research he wrote
in his article, "The Light Source in
High-Voltage Photography," "We
have all been excited and thrilled by
the beautiful Kirlian photographs
we have seen and are understand
ably elated by what we think they
may portend about the nature of

our experiments carefully enough
to continue making meaningful
progress?"
And he concluded that' 'there is a
specific physical explanation, called
the streamer phenomenon of
corona discharge, that can account
for all the observations made to
date. The identification of a specific
physical mechanism does not mean
that energy interactions with non
physical levels may not be inti
mately involved. We are definitely
not conducting our experiments
carefully enough to make rapid and
meaningful progress."
The sobering reality was unav
oidable: the Russian's identification
of the Kirlian light patterns with the
auras of animate objects had been
premature. American electrical en
gineers had studied the "streamer
phenomenon of corona discharge"
for three decades and had formu
lated a virtually unassailable
theoretical model of the process.
The key to explaining the genera
tion of light in a high voltage electri
cal field is embodied in the fact that
a small amount of ionization, or the
splitting of atoms or molecules into
positive ions and negative elec
trons, is continuously taking place
in the air around us.
The region between the two elec
trodes used in Kirlian photography
qualifies as an electrical field by vir
tue of the positive electrical charge
carried by one and the negative
charge carried by the other when
the power source is on.
The charged particles in the air
between the electrodes start to ac
celerate toward the oppositely
charged electrode as soon as the
field is created. If the field is strong
enough, they will acquire such great
velocity that when they collide with
other atoms or molecules in their
path more electrons are liberated,
increasing the net number of
charged particles. These in turn ac
celerate and split other atoms and
molecules leading to a chain reac
tion or "avalanche." This process
will occur in a direct current (DC)
field or an alternating current (AC)
field.
Modern Kirlian devices employ
an AC field. AC power sources
cause the sign of the charge of the
two electrodes to rapidly alternate.
The lower electrode, for example, is
first positive for an instant, then
negative for an equally brief instant,
then positive again and so on, while
the upper electrode always bears
the opposite charge. The genera
tion of light depends on the conver
sion of enerqy in the form of motion

to energy in the form of light
In a great simplification of the ac
tual process, it can be stated that in
the instant during which the lower
electrode is positive, electrons,
being negatively charged, acceler
ate downward; when the upper
electrode becomes positive, the
electrons slow down, stop, reverse
direction and move upward until
the field is again reversed; their ini
tial velocity downward was con
verted during their reversal of direc
tion into light by a process known as
recombination. Since many elec
trons participate in this chain of
events, the amount of light gener
ated can be observed by eye or
photographic film.
Objects in the field, or indeed, the
electrodes themselves, interact with
the moving electrons and cause
spatially non-uniform light genera
tion which results in the characteris
tic light patterns.
This, in essence, was the
phenomenon observed by the Kir
lians. The principle difference bet
ween the work of the Russian hus
band and wife and the American
engineers studying corona dis
charge was that the engineers were
interested in the theory of the field's
effect on gases while the couple was
concerned with the effect of ani
mate and inanimate objects on the
field.
It thus became obvious to Tiller,
among others, that the "observa
tions made to date" could be ac
counted for with a "specific physical
model." Or at least most of the ob
servations: at the time Tiller started
his experiments several aspects of
the phenomenon seemed likely to
defy incorporation into the laws of
the physical universe.
It was tempting to believe, for
example, that the brilliant hues of
Kirlian photographs made with
color film bore a relationship to the
physical or mental state of the sub
ject.
"Many articles have appeared on
the subject of Kirlian photography
which have revealed some rather
remarkable color effects," Tiller
wrote in his article, "The Colors in
Kirlian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?"
"Most of the authors seem de
lightfully mystified as to the source
of these various colors but are firmly
convinced that they are associated
with basic energy changes in the
living system being photographed.
This is extremely important if true;
however, it is too important to just
assume it to be so."
Also tempting to believe was the
idea that the frequent presence of
bright areas at acupuncture points
revealed in Kirlian photographs was
evidence that these points were
junctions of the physical and what
the psychics call the etheric body (of
which the aura is thought to be a
manifestation.)
But most seductive of all was the
phantom leaf effect. The Kirlian ap
pearance of a living presence where
no life could be seen seemed, in
spite of everything, dramatic proof
of the etheric body's existence.

Tiller dispatched the mystery
surrounding the Kirlian
colors with a short series of ex
periments in 1973. Starting from
the simple observation that photo
graphic film seldom lies completely
flat on the surface of the electrode,
he postulated in "The colors of Kir
lian Photography — Fact or Ar
tifact?" that all colors other than
white or blue "are due to ultraviolet
light produced by a discharge bet
ween the back of the film and the
metal electrode exposing the color
film from the back side."
Once this idea had been put
forth, "the marvelous reds,
oranges, yellows and magentas
seen in the results of other inves
tigators" were readily explainable
in terms of the multi-layered nature
of color film.
"The typical film is composed of
three light-sensitive layers or emul
sions," he explained. "Exposure of

the first layer produces a blue color
upon development. Exposure of
the second and third layers pro
duces green and red colors, respec
tively, upon development. Thus,
blue, green or red light entering the
emulsion side of the film will expose
the blue, green or red layer, respec
tively. . . . All three layers (are sensi
tive to) blue or ultraviolet light. A
yellow filter layer is placed between
the first and second emulsion to
block the blue and ultraviolet light
entering the film from the front side
from passing through to expose the
second and third emulsions.
"When ultraviolet light enters the

film from the back side," he con
tinued, "it passes through the film
backing and exposes both the third
and second emulsions producing
red and green, respectively. For low
intensity exposure, the third layer is
exposed strongly and the second
layer is weakly exposed producing
an almost pure red color. The lack
of exposure of the green emulsion
for low light intensities is due to the
strong attenuation of the ultraviolet
light upon passing through the red
layer. For more intense exposures,
the second emulsion is exposed
more and more leading first to an
orange and then to a yellow color.

Thus, the origin of the red, orange
and yellow colors is due to ul
traviolet light entering the back side
of the film. It should also be noted
that areas exposed from both the
front and the back side of the film
will develop to a magenta (mixture
of blue and red)."
White he attributed to a "bleach
ing effect due to high light inten
sity," while blue was produced by
the corona discharge of air (blue
and ultraviolet light).
Finally, he explained, the air gap
between the film and the electrode
"can be quite small, approximately
the thickness of a piece of paper
(two to five thousandths of an inch)
and still be sufficient to allow dis
charge formation."
Tiller concluded the paper on a
portentous note: "These experi
ments show that most work done to
date on Kirlian photography has
not been done carefully enough to
stand as proof of energy changes in
living systems associated with heal
ers, changes of mental states or
emotional states, etc. Future work
in this area will require much more
exacting control of the experimen
tal configuration in order to provide
meaningful results."
The association of Kirlian bright
areas with acupuncture points has
not yet yielded unequivocally to
physical explanation but all evi
dence indicates that it is primarily an
electrical phenomenon.
Physiological researchers have
shown that the acupuncture points
used by the Chinese are inter
connected by pathways of low elec
trical resistance. If "the surface
chemistry of the living electrode
(which is intimately related to its
electrical conductivity) . . . strongly
influences the pattern observed in
discharge," as Tiller speculates in

his paper "Unveiling the Mysteries
of Kirlian Photography," then it is
doubtful that coincidence of the Kir
lian bright spots with the Chinese
acupuncture points will require the
postulation of an etheric body.
The lack of experimental rigor
cited by Tiller in reference to the
Kirlian colors emerged again in the
case of the phantom leaf effect. In
his article, "Kirlian Photography: Its
Scientific Foundation and Future
Potentials," Tiller described the
"inappropriate experimental pro
tocol" leading to the effect.
"In the past, no one took a fresh
leaf, cut a portion away and then
carefully placed it in the device for
photographing — and ultimately
obtained a clear leaf-like pattern on
the film in the region of the cut seg
ment The general procedure was
either (a) to place the whole leaf on
the film and cover it with a glass
plate to weigh it down for between
one and 30 minutes, then carefully
remove the glass plate without dis
turbing the leaf and carefully cut
away a portion of the leaf without
moving the rest of it on the film . . .
the phantom leaf often appears in
this case but can be readily attri
buted to either chemical sensitiza
tion or electrostatic sensitization of
the film; or (b) to first place a glass
plate on the film and then to place
the whole leaf on the glass plate and
cover it with a second glass plate for
between one and 30 minutes, and
then follow the same procedure as
in (a). In this case, the Kirlian
photograph may also show the
phantom effect but again this must
be considered as artifact because
we now have an electrostatic and
chemical imprinting of the electros
tatic charge pattern from the leaf
onto the glass plates."


The top part of this leaf has been removed; it's outline in light remains in this example of the
phantom leaf effect. Photographs of this type have been taken by many as evidence of the
existence of "auras" associated with living things.
Despite the disqualification of
almost all phantom leaf photo
graphs on the basis of this "inap
propriate experimental protocol"
Tiller reported that he had seen "a
respectable picture of the phantom
leaf which cannot be attributed to
the artifact (phenomenon)," so that
it is not yet possible to dismiss the
effect completely.

<tlt came out of course
1 with lots and lots of
fanfare," Tiller said in sum
mary of Kirlian photography's
career in the United States. "People
rushed instead of doing good, solid
work and then talked a lot about
what they'd like to find; they read
those kinds of things into their data
without really having any hard data.
In all fairness, most of the people
working in the field weren't compe
tent to approach the thing. It's a
very, very complex phenome
non. . . .
"There has been a great fall in
interest relative to Kirlian recently,
because of the work of Peheck,
Kyler and Faust.
"Their observations support all
the things we said from the begin
ning. The dilemma in their paper is
the way people leaped on it and

said 'it's all a matter of moisture.'
(Variable water content of animate
objects) is one of the very big ef
fects; but people now say it's all
water and therefore it's not impor
tant. Well that's not quite true."
In a recent Science magazine ar
ticle entitled "Image Modulation in
Corona Discharge Photography,"
John Peheck, Harry Kyler and
David Faust concluded that "most
of the variations in the images of the
corona discharge of a living subject
who is in contact with the photo
graphic film can be accounted for
by the presence of moisture on or
within the subject's surface."
The net conclusion of their study,
funded by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense, was that "the photo
graphic response to moisture
suggests that corona discharge
photography may be useful in the
detection and quantification of
moisture in animate and inanimate
specimens through the orderly
modulation of the image due to var
ious levels of moisture."
But at this point when it might
appear that Kirlian photography is
soon to be relegated to the ranks of
interesting but inconsequential
phenomena, Tiller is quietly perse

vering in the work he began at the
start of this decade.
"There are three prongs to the
work I've done over the past 10
years," he explained. "One prong
has been experimental develop
ment — to be able to perceive and
sense and be aware. The second
one has been theoretical modelling
of the universe — to be able to
rationalize all of these non
conventional phenomena as well as
the conventional ones within the
framework set or description of the
universe — which means you have
to expand your present paradigms.
The third one is to develop
techniques for analyzing or measur
ing these things — to know when
you're off base and when you're on
base. So I'll just go forward as best I
can. At the moment it looks as if
we're in a condition where the
theory is in good shape and we're
starting to do something interesting
experimentally.
"It is possible to rationalize all the
data based upon conventional
kinds of things," he continued. "I
happen to think that non
conventional kinds of energies also
function in the framework of the
body and are also seen in the Kir
lian; but they can't be interpreted
because of the convetional pro
cess."
In "Kirlian Photography: Its Sci
entific Foundations and Future Po
tentials," Tiller considered more
deeply the problem of exploring the
field he has named "psychoenerge
tics."
First defining nonphysical ener
gies as "(a) energies of a nonelec
tromagnetic, nonsonic and non
gravitational variety as we know
them, (b) energies that do not di
rectly stimulate our five physical
senses as we know them and (c)
energies that do not propagate in
the 4-dimensional space-time con
tinuum as we know it,"and giving
as an example of nonphysical
energy the aura of a living thing,
he writes "There are three
categories of devices one may use

for monitoring nonphysical ener
gies: (a) a human being who has
already developed other sensory
systems, makes observations with
them and provides a verbal read
out, (b) a living system (animal,
plant or human) plus an attached
electromagnetic or mechanical de
vice such that the living system un
consciously or consciously trans
duces the nonphysical energies into
physical correlates that input to a

readout device via a purely physical
path (e.g., Kirlian devices), and (c) a
totally inanimate device based
upon a different logic system than
that which we call the physical,
which acts as a transducer and a
readout mechanism (nothing avail
able in this category at present).
"As the Kirlian device falls in the
middle category, we should not be
at all surprised (or dismayed) to find
a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the generation of light The im
portant and difficult step is to prove
that such observations are indeed
directly correlated with energy
changes in the living system rather
than just random fluctuations as
sociated with inadequate experi
mental technique."
To prepare for such a step, Tiller
sees the need for more refined in
struments and impeccable experi
mental technique. Expanding on
this point, Modlin said, "We'll have
to advance our technology. This is
usually the case when there's a new
discovery which indicates some
kind of new effect. You usually
have to fine tune the apparatus until
you eliminate the things which mess
you up and keep refining it until
you've got a valid tool."
While much of the work with Kir
lian photography up to the present
has "really been play," according
to Young, "It has served to de
monstrate the true complexity of
the problem and point the direction
for future research."
Tiller himself clearly regards the
future with optimism: "The di
lemma I have now is that I sense
and perceive these things but I
don't know if I'm a short time in the
future or a long time.
"It just seems to me a wonderful
surprise is in store for man within
the next two decades."


"We appeared to be seeing the very life activities of the leaf
itself. Intense, dynamic energy in the healthy leaf, less in the
withered leaf, nothing in the dead leaf." —Semoyon Kirlian
as quoted by Ostrander and Schroeder.
