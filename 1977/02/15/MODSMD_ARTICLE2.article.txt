We have all heard the
expression, "When an
idea's time has come, no
thing on earth can stop it!"
Well, we are at that mo
ment in time when such an
event is happening—a
transformation is occurring
in man! Future mankind
will probably look back
and say that the beginning
of the Psychic Age of Man
occurred around the early
19705.
—William A. Tiller 1972
The passage of five years has
not dimmed the optimistic
spirit with which Materials Sciences
Prof. William Tiller heralded the
dawn of a new age for man. But his
is a cautious voice among those
who subscribe to the dazzling pre
tensions of the "psychic" world. He
approaches this realm with a discip
line foreign to most of the new
era's harbingers who non-plus the
uninitiate with the apparent bound
lessness of their claims.
In February 1973 he wrote,
"Many thousands of years ago,
mankind found itself on the shores
of the Mediterranean and built ships
to explore its environs. They we
ren't very good ships, there was lit
tle knowledge of navigation and
great dangers were present. Ini
tially, few of the ships returned and
many stories of the great dangers of
that space 'out there' developed
However, with the passage of time,
continued courage, careful obser
vation and much thought, reliable
ships and navigational instruments
were developed. The dangers still
existed but could be controlled, and

man gained reliable understanding
of this earth's physical space. Of
late, we have even begun the con
quest of physical space in those
worlds closest to the earth.
"Now, man once again finds
himself clustered on the shores of a
vast domain but now it is not physi
cal space that beckons to his adven
turous spirit but other spaces (called
inner space by some). Once again,
he moves forward with an in
adequately constructed vehicle and
with poorly developed instruments
for orienting himself in the frames of
reference of these new spaces.
Once again, there are a variety of
dangers awaiting him. However,
once again we can anticipate that
he will eventually overcome all
these difficulties and gain reliable
procedures for cogniting and map
ping the furthest reaches of these
new domains."
Today, with the existence of the
"vast domain" still assumed. Tiller
is dedicated to improving the con
struction of the vehicles and further
ing the development of the instru
ments. His success or failure in
those endeavors may have more
than a casual effect on man's per
ception of himself and what he re
gards as reality.


"Like summer lightning . . . craters erupted—not fiery lava, but radiance like the aurora
borealis!' " — an anonymous Russian, describing the light patterns of Kirlian photography
to authors Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schoreder. Kirlian photographs such as this one of a
fingerpad have evoked many such descriptions.
