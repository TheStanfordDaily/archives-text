# The
						contest
## 
### 
A total of 79 photographers en
tered 192 photographs in the 1977
Stanford Daily Photo Contest.
The three judges, a member of
the Art Museum staff, a photo
grapher from the University News
and Publications Office, and a
member of the Daily Photography
Department, spent most of a morn
ing just in selecting a small group of
photos in each category for serious
consideration There were so many
worthy entries left at this point that
the judges added the designation
"honorable mention" in each
category so that more than seven
photographs could receive recogni
tion.
We would thus like to thank all
who entered for making the contest
a success, and of course extend our
gratitude to the judges without
whom we could not appreciate the
full extent of that success
