Edward Levi, U.S. Attorney General
during the Ford administration, will
be a guest professor at the Stanford
Law School during Spring semes
ter 1978.
Levi will be able "to teach what he
wants to teach," commented Law
School Dean Charles Meyers. He
added that Levi is expected to discuss
"problems faced by the Attorney Gen
eral" and in particular "anti-trust
suits."
Assoc. Law School Dean J. Keith
Mann said that Levi would not be
teaching at the undergraduate level.
Levi was preceded as Attorney Gen
eral by William Saxbe, a Republican
senator from Ohio from 1969-74; Elliot
Richardson; and Richard Kleindienst
and John Mitchell, both of whom res
igned while under criminal indict
ment during the Nixon administra
tion.
As the first post-Nixon Attorney
General, Levi was able "to restore con
fidence in the Justice Department,"
said Meyers.
Mann agreed, saying he was "im
pressed" with Levi and admired his
setting up certain ethical standards
and emphasizing the "neutrality" of
the department.
Levi was in Egypt and unavailable
for comment. He is currently working
at the University of Chicago Law
School.
