The provocative issue of abortion is still with us — and it
should be. For as Mark Twain once noted, "I know that I am
prejudiced in this matter, but I would be ashamed of myself
if I were not." Neutrality should be unthinkable when it
comes to protecting the sanctity of life.
Four years ago the Supreme Court handed down its deci
sion—one which constitutional scholars (even some in
favor of abortion like Prof. Ely of Harvard) have rigorously
criticized. The dissent (by Justices White and Rehnquist)
correctly stated the issue:
"The Court apparently values the convenience of the
pregnant woman more than the continued existence and
development of the life or potential life that she carries."
Convenience or life?
This is the fundamental issue: convenience versus life.
There is little disagreement that the fetus is alive. He is

genetically complete from conception. In 25 days, his heart
is beating. Electrical brain waves may be recorded as early
as 43 days. All of his body systems are present by eight
weeks, and working by 11. By six weeks he will respond to
some stimuli. In nine to 10 weeks he can squint, swallow
and make a fist.
In fact, an editorial (in favor of legalized abortion) in
California Medicine, the official journal of the California
Medical Association, noted that the rhetoric surrounding
abortion betrays "a curious avoidance of the scientific fact,
which everyone knows, that human life begins at concep
tion and is continuous, whether intra or extra-uterine, until
death.
"The very considerable semantic gymnastics which are
required to rationalize abortion as anything but the taking
of human life would be ludicrous if not often put forth
under socially impeccable auspices."

The absurdity goes further. Homeowners may kill crab
grass. Doctors may kill cancer cells. Animals may be killed.
But we "terminate," "remove" or "abort." Such
euphemisms serve to ease consciences, nothing more.
Abortion is killing — it destroys life. This is not the removal
of a cyst, a tumor or some diseased organ. Rather, it is the
killing of a unique and developing human being.
Given that the unborn child is human life, we must seek a
justification for killing it. Certainly most people would
agree that life should not be taken lightly — our legal and
moral structure is based upon the transcendence of the
right to life. Of the usual justifications cited to support abor
tion, only a threat to the mother's life should force the
unborn child to yield its right to life.
The least persuasive is the mother's right to "control her

body." Though a woman should be able to "control her
body," the unborn child is not a mere appendage — it is
genetically separate.
Dr. Kass, a University of Chicago biologist, has noted that
"the fetus simply is not a mere part of a woman's body."
Pregnancy is an inconvenience, albeit a major one, but
should our society condone killing because it is conve
nient?
Avoiding moral argument
Another argument suggests that abortion, whatever our
feelings on it, should be legalized because women will get
abortions anyway, and will be at the mercy of "backroom
hacks." This is obviously a matter of great concern, but it
dodges the moral issue altogether. Should homicide be
legalized? The aggressor may be killed by someone defend
ing himself. Should burglary be legalized? The burglar may
get bitten by a watchdog, shot by an irate vicitm or be
injured while escaping. We must address the moral issue of
killing.
The last argument frequently advanced is that abortion is
necessary to prevent the birth of unwanted children who
will be mistreated. Though the relationship seems simple at
first glance, the evidence is inconclusive. But even if some
relationship is proved, killing the unborn child runs against
the human experience—that most people want life, at most
any cost. And, of course, the unborn child has not been
consulted about its preference.
But this line of reasoning exposes an even more insidious
concern — the highly artificial line which is being drawn.
All of the arguments as to unwanted and retarded children
support infanticide, as well as abortion. In fact, it seems
more logical to declare life to be "meaningful" at five days
or one year or five years, so as to allow all children to be
evaluated. Any unwanted or retarded child could then be
painlessly killed, thus saving everyone a lot of inconveni
ence.
Drawing the line
Preposterous, you say? As Albert Schweitzer noted, "If a
man loses reverence for any part of life, he will lose his
reverence for all life." If you are not willing to kill a human
being at birth, then how about a minute before? And a
minute before that? Is there any rationality behind drawing
the line at birth (or at "viability")?
If one does not admit the humanity of the unborn child,
who is manifestly growing and living,how can one admit it
for any human being? This tenuous division between "ex
pendable" and "non-expendable" life is frightening.
Should the right to life be based on such an artificial and
arbitrary line? And can we respect life at the other end of the
spectrum, if we are not willing to respect it at the begin
ning? What other powerless group will be next?
In 1975, the West German Constitutional Court required
the state to prevent abortions (even the dissent agreed that
fetal life deserved protection).
In the U.S., citizens protest the killing of blackbirds by the
army, baby seals by Canadian hunters, and convicted mur
derers by the state, while the Supreme Court places con
venience before the killing of unborn children. Are these the
priorities of a rational and humane society? We would do
well to heed the slogan of one Pro-Life group: "Abortion is
not healthy for children and other living things."
