# Pot use on rise in state
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — The
number of Californians who
have tried marijuana is up, and
much of the increase is due to
middle-aged adults, a state
agency reported yesterday.
Thirty-five per cent of adults
questioned last November in a
statewide survey said they had
tried pot and 14 per cent clas
sified themselves as current us
ers.
A poll taken 21 months earlier,
in February, 1975, found 28 per
cent of those questioned had
smoked marijuana and nine per
cent considered themselves cur
rent users.
The study said much of the in
crease was centered in Southern
California and Northern Califor
nia outside the San Francisco
Bay area.
It added that it did not appear
that a cut in the state's marijuana
penalties had prompted the in
crease, saying that only three per
cent had first tried marijuana in
the last year.
A state law that took effect in
January 1976 made marijuana
possession a misdemeanor with
maximum penalty of a $100 fine
for possession of an ounce or
less. Previously possession
could be a felony or mis
demeanor.
In the latest poll, 66 per cent of
persons between 18 and 29 said
they had tried marijuana and 31
per cent said they were current
users. That compares with 54
and 24 per cent in the earlier
survey.
Forty-seven per cent of those
in their 30s said they had
smoked pot and 16 per cent said
they were current users. In the
1975 survey, 35 per cent said
they had tried pot and five per
cent said they were current us
ers.
Nineteen per cent of persons
40 to 49 reported trying pot,
while four per cent said they
were present users.
Of those questioned between
the ages 50 and 59, 12 per cent
said they had smoked marijuana
and two per cent said they were
using it then. That compares
with figures of six per cent and
zero in 1975.
Most of those who said they
were not using marijuana cited
lack of interest or health fears as
their reasons. Only two per cent
said they did not smoke pot be
cause its use was illegal.
