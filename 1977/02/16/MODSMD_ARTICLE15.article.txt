# IRS issues faulty tax advice
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —Do you
sometimes make mistakes when
filling out your income tax re
turn because of the complexities
of the law? Smile, you've got
company within the Internal Re
venue Service itself.
The IRS has found mistakes in
its own instruction book printed
to help taxpayers file their taxes.
The 192-page publication "Your
Federal Income Tax 1977 Edi
tion" is a primary source of tax
payer information made availa
ble, free, by the IRS. This year's
edition is turning up in tax
payers' hands with at least five
mistakes.
The IRS has attempted to cor
rect the errors found in its own
publication by inserting a miy
take sheet advising taxpayers to
delete some passages and substi
tute others.
An IRS spokesman said the er
rors were "the result of pressures
and deadlines imposed on the

service as a result of late passage
of the Tax Reform Act of 1976."
That legislation, making numer
ous changes in the tax code, was
signed into law Oct. 4.
The spokesman said that only
a small number of the books
were distributed without the
correction sheets.
Lost sheets
If you got a book without the
corrections, or if your mistake
sheet slipped out of the book and
is lost, here are the changes that
should be made:
—Rental Income. The IRS for
got to advise taxpayers of a new
provision of the law that affects
anyone who rents property to a
friend or relative. And that pro
vision requires that if you rent
the property for less than 15
days, any income you receive is
not taxable but neither can you
take any deductions for ex
penses other than interest, taxes
and casualty losses.

The mistake sheet makes two
corrections concerning this
omission:
—Earned Income Credit. This
is the credit that can allow a
qualified taxpayer who has
earned less than $8000 to obtain
a refund that might even be grea
ter than income taxes withheld.
To be eligible for the credit
you must maintain a household
for the entire year for you and
your child who is under 19 or, if
19 or older, a full-time student.
But you also can be eligible if
your child is 19 or older and is
disabled. In this case the child
need not be a full-time student,
but the IRS publication does not
say this. The correction is made
on the mistake sheet.
Transferred property
Finally, two corrections were
required for rules under prop
erty transferred to a foreign trust
and concerning stock options

under provisions governing the
maximum tax on earned income.
Those changes should not have
wide application for the majority
of U.S. taxpayers.
Any mistakes by the IRS can
not be used as an excuse by the
taxpayer for paying a lower
amount of tax than should be
paid.
The law says that taxpayers
may be liable for any interest and
penalties that result from er
roneous payment of a lower tax.
And tax preparers also can be
penalized $100 for negligent ad
vice if the advice results in er
roneous payment of a lower tax.
But the service takes no re
sponsibility for errors found in
its publications or advice given
by its employes. This position
has been upheld by the courts
which have ruled that it is the
taxpayer's responsibility to pay
the right amount of taxes, re
gardless of any IRS help.
