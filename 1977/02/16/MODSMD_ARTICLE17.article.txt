# Di Bo at the helm:
## some nights are more frustrating than others Daily text by John Freed photos by Mark Funk

Though he tries to look calm, he's obviously the one in charge.
"Move! Oh, you're a son-of-a..."
The constant chew, chew, chew on a wad of gum gives him away.
"Make 'em work out there; make 'em work."
He's Dick Dißiaso. And his team is losing to the Oregon Ducks.
"Sag, Jeff...He's not a shooter."
Dißiaso is not a man who likes to be behind. So, when he's not
shouting strategy hints to his players, he's letting the referees know
what he thinks of their officiating.
For instance, after an Oregon player walks with the ball: "Travel!
God Almighty!"

His Cards weren't behind the whole night, though. In fact, they
scored the first basket of the game. Dißiaso lept to his feet, cheering
and clapping. Glancing down the row of chairs which comprise the
Stanford "bench," he noticed injured guard Jay Carter, who seemed
to be paying little attention.
Dißiaso whirled on Carter, standing eyeball-to-eyeball. If you can't
get involved, he shouted, "get out of the ball game and get into the
showers." He turned on his heel and stalked back to his seat.
Moments later, when Oregon had tied the game, Dißo started on a
series of comments which would eventually lead to a technical foul.
Oregon forward Ernie Kent was setting illegal screens, Dißiaso was
claiming.
"Thirty-five is moving on the screen—that's illegal," the coach
said to Robert Herrold, the umpire for the night's game.
"Illegal screen, Bob...They push off," Dißiaso complained a few

minutes later.
Referee Booker Turner looked at Dißiaso, shrugged his shoulders
and said, "I didn't see it."
"They push off to get open," Dißiaso added. "They set illegal
screens —you guys blow those calls."
Umpire Herrold perked up at that comment. Wagging his finger,
he condescendingly told Dißiaso, "You've got a technical."
And you thought a coach had to swear to get one.
Dißiaso exploded.
"This guy moves —he can't move like that," Dißiaso shouted, his
anger increasing. "That man is only allowed to move backwards—he
is not allowed to move laterally!"
"They set more illegal screens than you've seen before in your
entire life," he grumbled.
As commander-in-chief, Dißiaso seems to want to take the full
brunt of the officials' wrath on himself. Assistant coach Tom
McLaughlin learned that after an exchange with Herrold.
"Travel! Travel!" McLaughlin shouted.
"You can get a technical too, you know," Herrold said out of the
side of his mouth as he walked past the Stanford bench. Apparently
ignoring the implications of the warning, McLaughlin was shouting
"Three seconds! Three seconds!" on the next Oregon possession.
Dißiaso's response was succinct:
"If you don't shut up, you get the hell out of here."
McLaughlin settled down. On the court, however, Stanford guard
Mike Bratz was relating some of is own observations on the officiat
ing. Like Dißiaso, he too was rewarded with a technical foul.
"Get him out of there," Dißiaso snapped. Bratz came to the bench.
"Mike—l get the technicals, not you. Now. you've been jawing all
game. If you can't shut up, I'm going to take you out —I don't care
how good you are," the coach advised.
Dißiaso was back in command.
And the officials hadn't yet heard the end of Dißiaso's remarks.
"There was offensive goaltending on the rim that time," he ad

vised Herrold. When the umpire was out of earshot, he added,
"You'll have to turn your check back."
In the second half, McLaughlin was feeding Dißiaso a minute
by-minute report on the number of fouls committed by Oregon
players. It was a simple task; Oregon was called for only one foul in
the first 12 minutes of the half. This was inconceivable to the Stan
ford crew —after all, Oregon has a reputation as one of the dirtiest
teams in the Pacific-8.
"Forty-four (Oregon guard Rob Closs) is all over them," Dißo told
umpire Herrold. "They've only committed one foul in the second
half—now, that's impossible."
Moments later, Closs hit Bratz in the face while executing a defen
sive maneuver. Herrold, apparently distracted by Dißiaso's remark
that "44's all over him (Bratz)," missed the play.
"Time out. Time out!" Dißiaso shouted, obviously upset. "Did
you see him (Closs) throw a punch?"
Herrold shrugged.
"You haven't seen anything..." Dißiaso said.
"Settle down," Herold suggested. "Next time, you're out."
"They're all over us," Dißiaso insisted.
Not all of the coach's uncomplimentary remarks were aimed at the
officials. During one timeout, he belittled the opponents.
"They don't have any talent," Dißiaso said, turning to Bratz. "You
yourself have more talent than them."
Late in the game, he made his only negative remark about his
team's performance. It came when Oregon stole the ball from a
fast-breaking Stanford team, turning the play into an Oregon tally
and icing the game.
"Shit, the guys don't have any discipline," he muttered, dejected.
At the final buzzer, Oregon led by nine. But the margin of defeat
didn't matter to Dißiaso —only the fact of defeat.
As he followed is team toward the locker room, he turned once
again to view the court at Maples.
The mask of depression on his face told his story.



In spite of Dißlaso's Churchill-like gestures (right) during a second period time out, his club could not defeat Oregon. After the contest, he slumps against the lockerroom wall,
(left) his only court three reporters.

"This guy moves —he can't move like that," Dißiaso shouted, his
anger increasing. "That man is only allowed to move backwards—he
is not allowed to move laterally!"
"They set more illegal screens than you've seen before in your
entire life," he grumbled.
As commander-in-chief, Dißiaso seems to want to take the full
brunt of the officials' wrath on himself. Assistant coach Tom
McLaughlin learned that after an exchange with Herrold.
"Travel! Travel!" McLaughlin shouted.
"You can get a technical too, you know," Herrold said out of the
side of his mouth as he walked past the Stanford bench. Apparently
ignoring the implications of the warning, McLaughlin was shouting
"Three seconds! Three seconds!" on the next Oregon possession.
Dißiaso's response was succinct:
"If you don't shut up, you get the hell out of here."
McLaughlin settled down. On the court, however, Stanford guard
Mike Bratz was relating some of is own observations on the officiat
ing. Like Dißiaso, he too was rewarded with a technical foul.
"Get him out of there," Dißiaso snapped. Bratz came to the bench.
"Mike—l get the technicals, not you. Now. you've been jawing all
game. If you can't shut up, I'm going to take you out —I don't care
how good you are," the coach advised.
Dißiaso was back in command.
And the officials hadn't yet heard the end of Dißiaso's remarks.
"There was offensive goaltending on the rim that time," he ad

vised Herrold. When the umpire was out of earshot, he added,
"You'll have to turn your check back."
In the second half, McLaughlin was feeding Dißiaso a minute
by-minute report on the number of fouls committed by Oregon
players. It was a simple task; Oregon was called for only one foul in
the first 12 minutes of the half. This was inconceivable to the Stan
ford crew —after all, Oregon has a reputation as one of the dirtiest
teams in the Pacific-8.
"Forty-four (Oregon guard Rob Closs) is all over them," Dißo told
umpire Herrold. "They've only committed one foul in the second
half—now, that's impossible."
Moments later, Closs hit Bratz in the face while executing a defen
sive maneuver. Herrold, apparently distracted by Dißiaso's remark
that "44's all over him (Bratz)," missed the play.
"Time out. Time out!" Dißiaso shouted, obviously upset. "Did
you see him (Closs) throw a punch?"
Herrold shrugged.
"You haven't seen anything..." Dißiaso said.
"Settle down," Herold suggested. "Next time, you're out."
"They're all over us," Dißiaso insisted.
Not all of the coach's uncomplimentary remarks were aimed at the
officials. During one timeout, he belittled the opponents.
"They don't have any talent," Dißiaso said, turning to Bratz. "You
yourself have more talent than them."
Late in the game, he made his only negative remark about his
team's performance. It came when Oregon stole the ball from a
fast-breaking Stanford team, turning the play into an Oregon tally
and icing the game.
"Shit, the guys don't have any discipline," he muttered, dejected.
At the final buzzer, Oregon led by nine. But the margin of defeat
didn't matter to Dißiaso —only the fact of defeat.
As he followed is team toward the locker room, he turned once
again to view the court at Maples.
The mask of depression on his face told his story.



In spite of Dißlaso's Churchill-like gestures (right) during a second period time out, his club could not defeat Oregon. After the contest, he slumps against the lockerroom wall,
(left) his only court three reporters.

Though he tries to look calm, he's obviously the one in charge.
"Move! Oh, you're a son-of-a..."
The constant chew, chew, chew on a wad of gum gives him away.
"Make 'em work out there; make 'em work."
He's Dick Dißiaso. And his team is losing to the Oregon Ducks.
"Sag, Jeff...He's not a shooter."
Dißiaso is not a man who likes to be behind. So, when he's not
shouting strategy hints to his players, he's letting the referees know
what he thinks of their officiating.
For instance, after an Oregon player walks with the ball: "Travel!
God Almighty!"

His Cards weren't behind the whole night, though. In fact, they
scored the first basket of the game. Dißiaso lept to his feet, cheering
and clapping. Glancing down the row of chairs which comprise the
Stanford "bench," he noticed injured guard Jay Carter, who seemed
to be paying little attention.
Dißiaso whirled on Carter, standing eyeball-to-eyeball. If you can't
get involved, he shouted, "get out of the ball game and get into the
showers." He turned on his heel and stalked back to his seat.
Moments later, when Oregon had tied the game, Dißo started on a
series of comments which would eventually lead to a technical foul.
Oregon forward Ernie Kent was setting illegal screens, Dißiaso was
claiming.
"Thirty-five is moving on the screen—that's illegal," the coach
said to Robert Herrold, the umpire for the night's game.
"Illegal screen, Bob...They push off," Dißiaso complained a few

minutes later.
Referee Booker Turner looked at Dißiaso, shrugged his shoulders
and said, "I didn't see it."
"They push off to get open," Dißiaso added. "They set illegal
screens —you guys blow those calls."
Umpire Herrold perked up at that comment. Wagging his finger,
he condescendingly told Dißiaso, "You've got a technical."
And you thought a coach had to swear to get one.
Dißiaso exploded.
"This guy moves —he can't move like that," Dißiaso shouted, his
anger increasing. "That man is only allowed to move backwards—he
is not allowed to move laterally!"
"They set more illegal screens than you've seen before in your
entire life," he grumbled.

umpire Herrold. "They've only committed one foul in the second
half—now, that's impossible."
Moments later, Closs hit Bratz in the face while executing a defen
sive maneuver. Herrold, apparently distracted by Dißiaso's remark
that "44's all over him (Bratz)," missed the play.
"Time out. Time out!" Dißiaso shouted, obviously upset. "Did
you see him (Closs) throw a punch?"
Herrold shrugged.
"You haven't seen anything..." Dißiaso said.
"Settle down," Herold suggested. "Next time, you're out."
"They're all over us," Dißiaso insisted.
Not all of the coach's uncomplimentary remarks were aimed at the
officials. During one timeout, he belittled the opponents.
"They don't have any talent," Dißiaso said, turning to Bratz. "You
yourself have more talent than them."
Late in the game, he made his only negative remark about his
team's performance. It came when Oregon stole the ball from a
fast-breaking Stanford team, turning the play into an Oregon tally
and icing the game.
"Shit, the guys don't have any discipline," he muttered, dejected.
At the final buzzer, Oregon led by nine. But the margin of defeat
didn't matter to Dißiaso —only the fact of defeat.
As he followed is team toward the locker room, he turned once
again to view the court at Maples.
The mask of depression on his face told his story.



In spite of Dißlaso's Churchill-like gestures (right) during a second period time out, his club could not defeat Oregon. After the contest, he slumps against the lockerroom wall,
(left) his only court three reporters.

Though he tries to look calm, he's obviously the one in charge.
"Move! Oh, you're a son-of-a..."
The constant chew, chew, chew on a wad of gum gives him away.
"Make 'em work out there; make 'em work."
He's Dick Dißiaso. And his team is losing to the Oregon Ducks.
"Sag, Jeff...He's not a shooter."
Dißiaso is not a man who likes to be behind. So, when he's not
shouting strategy hints to his players, he's letting the referees know
what he thinks of their officiating.
For instance, after an Oregon player walks with the ball: "Travel!
God Almighty!"

His Cards weren't behind the whole night, though. In fact, they
scored the first basket of the game. Dißiaso lept to his feet, cheering
and clapping. Glancing down the row of chairs which comprise the
Stanford "bench," he noticed injured guard Jay Carter, who seemed
to be paying little attention.
Dißiaso whirled on Carter, standing eyeball-to-eyeball. If you can't
get involved, he shouted, "get out of the ball game and get into the
showers." He turned on his heel and stalked back to his seat.
Moments later, when Oregon had tied the game, Dißo started on a
series of comments which would eventually lead to a technical foul.
Oregon forward Ernie Kent was setting illegal screens, Dißiaso was
claiming.
"Thirty-five is moving on the screen—that's illegal," the coach
said to Robert Herrold, the umpire for the night's game.
"Illegal screen, Bob...They push off," Dißiaso complained a few

minutes later.
Referee Booker Turner looked at Dißiaso, shrugged his shoulders
and said, "I didn't see it."
"They push off to get open," Dißiaso added. "They set illegal
screens —you guys blow those calls."
Umpire Herrold perked up at that comment. Wagging his finger,
he condescendingly told Dißiaso, "You've got a technical."
And you thought a coach had to swear to get one.
Dißiaso exploded.
"This guy moves —he can't move like that," Dißiaso shouted, his
anger increasing. "That man is only allowed to move backwards—he
is not allowed to move laterally!"
"They set more illegal screens than you've seen before in your
entire life," he grumbled.
As commander-in-chief, Dißiaso seems to want to take the full
brunt of the officials' wrath on himself. Assistant coach Tom
McLaughlin learned that after an exchange with Herrold.
"Travel! Travel!" McLaughlin shouted.
"You can get a technical too, you know," Herrold said out of the
side of his mouth as he walked past the Stanford bench. Apparently
ignoring the implications of the warning, McLaughlin was shouting
"Three seconds! Three seconds!" on the next Oregon possession.
Dißiaso's response was succinct:
"If you don't shut up, you get the hell out of here."
McLaughlin settled down. On the court, however, Stanford guard
Mike Bratz was relating some of is own observations on the officiat
ing. Like Dißiaso, he too was rewarded with a technical foul.
"Get him out of there," Dißiaso snapped. Bratz came to the bench.
"Mike—l get the technicals, not you. Now. you've been jawing all
game. If you can't shut up, I'm going to take you out —I don't care
how good you are," the coach advised.
Dißiaso was back in command.
And the officials hadn't yet heard the end of Dißiaso's remarks.
"There was offensive goaltending on the rim that time," he ad

vised Herrold. When the umpire was out of earshot, he added,
"You'll have to turn your check back."
In the second half, McLaughlin was feeding Dißiaso a minute
by-minute report on the number of fouls committed by Oregon
players. It was a simple task; Oregon was called for only one foul in
the first 12 minutes of the half. This was inconceivable to the Stan
ford crew —after all, Oregon has a reputation as one of the dirtiest
teams in the Pacific-8.
"Forty-four (Oregon guard Rob Closs) is all over them," Dißo told
umpire Herrold. "They've only committed one foul in the second
half—now, that's impossible."
Moments later, Closs hit Bratz in the face while executing a defen
