Gymnastics
For Stanford gymnasts num
bers told the story, and although
the team totals favored the host
San Jose State, the individual
scores provided much op
timism. In last Saturday's meet,
the Spartans took the team com
petition, compiling 199.80
points to Stanford's 160.30 sum.
Individually, however, this
meet and the previous ones have
given valuable experience to the
Cards. Tad Bostick, Chris
Takimoto and Al Nemcek
particularly fine performances.
Nemcek, a junior from Brook
field, Wis,, placed first in vault
ing with a 9.1, while sophomore
Takimoto earned an 8.4 score to
win first place in the pommel

horse. Freshman Bostick earned
second place in floor exercise
pommel horse, parallel bars,
high bar and all around, with
scores of 9.0, 8 2, 8.6, 8.7 and
51.0 respectively.
In addition to the men's team,
Stanford was represented Satur
day by two women, Lucia Tus
fanelli and Sandra Muramalsu,
who placed second and fourth
respectively in all around com
petition. Women's gymnastics
currently holds club sport status,
but beginning next year the
program will reach the varsity
level.
The next meet for the Cardi
nals is February 18, on the Chico
State campus, at 8 p.m.
