# Card nine tops Spartans

### Chris Kamel 
Stanford improved its baseball
record to 7-2 yesterday at home
as the Cards put together all as
pects of their game in an H-6 vic
tory over San Jose State.
Stanford found itself behind
early in the game as winning
pitcher Card Bruce Fiala (2-1)
gave up a double and a home run
to fall behind 2-0 in the first in
ning. The sophomore righthan
der started to throw well after
that until the sixth inning when
he got in trouble and was re
lieved.
Stanford's batters, on the other
hand, consistently tormented
the Spartans' starting pitcher
John Bridgeman as the Cards
pounded him for two runs in the
second inning with a single by
Dave Perez and a home run over
the left field wall by Mike
Codiroli,
Comeback
Stanford came right back in
the third for three more which
started off with a walk by Larry
Reynolds with no outs. Todd
Ervin then singled Reynolds to
second and a Randy Wong dou
ble, one of two for the day for the
junior, scored Reynolds and
moved Ervin to third.
With the Cards ahead for the
first time, 3-2, the Spartans'
pitcher threw a wild pitch which

scored Ervin and moved Wong
to third. Bruce Walter then hit in
Wong with a sacrifice fly.
Stanford finished off starter
Bridgeman early in the fifth in
ning when Ervin drew a walk
and Wong again doubled, this
time into the right field corner.
Ervin moved to third.
Brother combinations
Spartan reliever Chris
Codiroli, brother of Stanford out
fielder Mike Codiroli, replaced
Bridgeman. The Codirolis were
only one of two brother combi
nations between Stanford and
San Jose State yesterday, the
other being first baseman Tom
Guardino and his brother Spar
tan second baseman Rich Guar
dino.
The Cards played no favorites
with San Jose's Codiroli, how
ever, as Ervin scored on a throw
ing error, and Wong and Walters
made it three runs for the inning

being singled in by Walters and *
Codiroli, respectively.
