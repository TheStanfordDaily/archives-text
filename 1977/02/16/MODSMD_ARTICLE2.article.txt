# Tenure, Honor Code, campus pub, nominations committee
## ASSU Council of Presidents keeping promises 
### Kathy Trafton News Analysis 
This year's ASSU Council of Presi
dents (COP) seems to have had much
success in keeping its campaign prom
ises, possibly giving a bit more than it
offered last spring.
The council's platform emphasized
tenure, restructuring the ASSU and re
forming the selection procedures of
the Nominations Committee. Since the
election, COP members have also

given attention to the Honor Code
issue and the establishment of an on
campus drinking facility.
"I think that we've seen more of a
tangible return in terms of actions and
proposals that reflect genuine student
interests from this COP than from any
other since I've been here."said Sen.
Tim Ferguson.
"We've given all we can possibly
give to our campaign issues," said
ASSU President Vic Petroff. "Some of

them were perhaps too ambitious, but
we made good progress on them. Soma
were too much to do in a year. Some of
the things we started are going to be
p' ked up next year and in future
years."
The COP has been "realistic in its
goals," said Sen. Dan
Livingston. "Petroff has been a very
realistic president. I can't criticize him
outside of communication problems. I
don't think communication between
the COP and the senate is all it could
have been."
"Some members of the COP seem to
be infected with the same notions of a
monopoly on wisdom that many
politicians seem to have, and this is
very much at odds with the view of
student government that I have. I tend
to want to trust students to make their
own decisions and to spend their own
money as they please." said Ferguson.
The COP vetoed a Ferguson
sponsored senate bill last week that
would have made salaries for members
of the COP subject to a fee assessment
from the student body.
The campaign's emphasis on tenure
was fulfilled by the COP-created task
force to study tenure and teaching
quality. A comprehensive report re
cently released by the task force dis
cussed the present relationship bet
ween teaching and tenure, and made
several proposals to alter it.
Among the task force's proposals
was a recommendation that every
course be evaluated by students each
time it is offered, and the suggestion
that professors be given salary boosts
for excellent teaching.
The report will be reviewed by sev
eral committees before it reaches the
Faculty Senate for action.
"We've got a hell of a good start in
the Tenure Report," Petroff said. "We
also organized SIT (Students In
terested in Tenure) because we wanted
assurance that some of the things we

started will be continued, will have
permanence."
To deal with a second campaign is
sue, restructuring the ASSU, ASSU
Vice President Carole Houck is con
ducting a SWOPSI course to study the
possibility of ASSU reform.
Lots of ideas
"I am really pleased with the prog
ress that the class is making," said
Houck. "We have a lot of ideas floating
around. We are moving much faster
than I had thought."
The final product will be presented
to the ASSU Senate, she said. "If we
come up with nothing, the senate can
go ahead on its own."
Committee selections reform was
achieved in part by the drafting of a
"criteria for selection" sheet, accord
ing to ASSU Vice President Al To
maszczuk.
The selections procedure was "back
in the stone age last spring when we
took office," he said. "We're nowhere
near where we should be in this pro
cess but I'm fairly optimistic on what
has been done."
The people sitting on various cam
pus committees now reflect a broad
range of political opinions, said To
maszczuk. Not all committee positions
were filled last spring because "we
didn't want to put anybody on a com
mittee who wasn't right," he said.
The Nominations committee is "a
little less political now," said Fergu
son. "It has been cleaned up. They still
ask people's opinions."
Honor Code
Some of the recent concern over
Honor Code violations is due to what
happened at West Point, said Petroff.
The COP worked through the Student
Conduct Legislative Council, placed a
full-page ad in the Daily, and sent a
letter containing a brief history of the
Honor Code to various departments to
be read to students.
The COP brought the on-campus

pub issue back into the open by or
ganizing a group to work toward get
ting a pub. After one meeting, the
group applied for a liquor license, Pet
roff said.
In minority affairs, the COP's objec
tives "were not well defined," said
Petroff. "We didn't do an adequate job
of meeting with minority leaders."
The COP took little action on the
Western Culture issue. Petroff said
more should have been done, and that
"we should have acted more quicklv."
Other accomplishments in the
graduate student area include work on
establishing a Teaching Resources
Center, a series of workshops on teach
ing for TAs (which will eventually be
OApanded to include professors), a
child care service, more social events
for graduate students and a graduate
student column in the Daily, Jennings
said.

were too much to do in a year. Some of
the things we started are going to be
p' ked up next year and in future
years."
The COP has been "realistic in its
goals," said Sen. Dan
Livingston. "Petroff has been a very
realistic president. I can't criticize him
outside of communication problems. I
don't think communication between
the COP and the senate is all it could
have been."
"Some members of the COP seem to
be infected with the same notions of a
monopoly on wisdom that many
politicians seem to have, and this is
very much at odds with the view of
student government that I have. I tend
to want to trust students to make their
own decisions and to spend their own
money as they please." said Ferguson.
The COP vetoed a Ferguson
sponsored senate bill last week that
would have made salaries for members
of the COP subject to a fee assessment
from the student body.
The campaign's emphasis on tenure
was fulfilled by the COP-created task
force to study tenure and teaching
quality. A comprehensive report re
cently released by the task force dis
cussed the present relationship bet
ween teaching and tenure, and made
several proposals to alter it.
Among the task force's proposals
was a recommendation that every
course be evaluated by students each
time it is offered, and the suggestion
that professors be given salary boosts
for excellent teaching.
The report will be reviewed by sev
eral committees before it reaches the
Faculty Senate for action.
"We've got a hell of a good start in
the Tenure Report," Petroff said. "We
also organized SIT (Students In
terested in Tenure) because we wanted
assurance that some of the things we

started will be continued, will have
permanence."
To deal with a second campaign is
sue, restructuring the ASSU, ASSU
Vice President Carole Houck is con
ducting a SWOPSI course to study the
possibility of ASSU reform.
Lots of ideas
"I am really pleased with the prog
ress that the class is making," said
Houck. "We have a lot of ideas floating
around. We are moving much faster
than I had thought."
The final product will be presented
to the ASSU Senate, she said. "If we
come up with nothing, the senate can
go ahead on its own."
Committee selections reform was
achieved in part by the drafting of a
"criteria for selection" sheet, accord
ing to ASSU Vice President Al To
maszczuk.
The selections procedure was "back
in the stone age last spring when we
took office," he said. "We're nowhere
near where we should be in this pro
cess but I'm fairly optimistic on what
has been done."
The people sitting on various cam
pus committees now reflect a broad
range of political opinions, said To
maszczuk. Not all committee positions
were filled last spring because "we
didn't want to put anybody on a com
mittee who wasn't right," he said.
The Nominations committee is "a
little less political now," said Fergu
son. "It has been cleaned up. They still
ask people's opinions."
Honor Code
Some of the recent concern over
Honor Code violations is due to what
happened at West Point, said Petroff.
The COP worked through the Student
Conduct Legislative Council, placed a
full-page ad in the Daily, and sent a
letter containing a brief history of the
Honor Code to various departments to
be read to students.
The COP brought the on-campus

pub issue back into the open by or
ganizing a group to work toward get
ting a pub. After one meeting, the
group applied for a liquor license, Pet
roff said.
In minority affairs, the COP's objec
tives "were not well defined," said
Petroff. "We didn't do an adequate job
of meeting with minority leaders."
The COP took little action on the
Western Culture issue. Petroff said
more should have been done, and that
"we should have acted more quicklv."
Other accomplishments in the
graduate student area include work on
establishing a Teaching Resources
Center, a series of workshops on teach
ing for TAs (which will eventually be
OApanded to include professors), a
child care service, more social events
for graduate students and a graduate
student column in the Daily, Jennings
said.
This year's ASSU Council of Presi
dents (COP) seems to have had much
success in keeping its campaign prom
ises, possibly giving a bit more than it
offered last spring.
The council's platform emphasized
tenure, restructuring the ASSU and re
forming the selection procedures of
the Nominations Committee. Since the
election, COP members have also

given attention to the Honor Code
issue and the establishment of an on
campus drinking facility.
"I think that we've seen more of a
tangible return in terms of actions and
proposals that reflect genuine student
interests from this COP than from any
other since I've been here."said Sen.
Tim Ferguson.

The campaign's emphasis on tenure
was fulfilled by the COP-created task
force to study tenure and teaching
quality. A comprehensive report re
cently released by the task force dis
cussed the present relationship bet
ween teaching and tenure, and made
several proposals to alter it.
Among the task force's proposals
was a recommendation that every
course be evaluated by students each
time it is offered, and the suggestion
that professors be given salary boosts
for excellent teaching.
The report will be reviewed by sev
eral committees before it reaches the
Faculty Senate for action.
"We've got a hell of a good start in
the Tenure Report," Petroff said. "We
also organized SIT (Students In
terested in Tenure) because we wanted
assurance that some of the things we

started will be continued, will have
permanence."
To deal with a second campaign is
sue, restructuring the ASSU, ASSU
Vice President Carole Houck is con
ducting a SWOPSI course to study the
possibility of ASSU reform.
Lots of ideas
"I am really pleased with the prog
ress that the class is making," said
Houck. "We have a lot of ideas floating
around. We are moving much faster
than I had thought."
The final product will be presented
to the ASSU Senate, she said. "If we
come up with nothing, the senate can
go ahead on its own."
Committee selections reform was
achieved in part by the drafting of a
"criteria for selection" sheet, accord
ing to ASSU Vice President Al To
maszczuk.
The selections procedure was "back
in the stone age last spring when we
took office," he said. "We're nowhere
near where we should be in this pro
cess but I'm fairly optimistic on what
has been done."
The people sitting on various cam
pus committees now reflect a broad
range of political opinions, said To
maszczuk. Not all committee positions
were filled last spring because "we
didn't want to put anybody on a com
mittee who wasn't right," he said.
The Nominations committee is "a
little less political now," said Fergu
son. "It has been cleaned up. They still
ask people's opinions."
Honor Code
Some of the recent concern over
Honor Code violations is due to what
happened at West Point, said Petroff.
The COP worked through the Student
Conduct Legislative Council, placed a
full-page ad in the Daily, and sent a
letter containing a brief history of the
Honor Code to various departments to
be read to students.
The COP brought the on-campus

pub issue back into the open by or
ganizing a group to work toward get
ting a pub. After one meeting, the
group applied for a liquor license, Pet
roff said.
In minority affairs, the COP's objec
tives "were not well defined," said
Petroff. "We didn't do an adequate job
of meeting with minority leaders."
The COP took little action on the
Western Culture issue. Petroff said
more should have been done, and that
"we should have acted more quicklv."
Other accomplishments in the
graduate student area include work on
establishing a Teaching Resources
Center, a series of workshops on teach
ing for TAs (which will eventually be
OApanded to include professors), a
child care service, more social events
for graduate students and a graduate
student column in the Daily, Jennings
said.
This year's ASSU Council of Presi
dents (COP) seems to have had much
success in keeping its campaign prom
ises, possibly giving a bit more than it
offered last spring.
The council's platform emphasized
tenure, restructuring the ASSU and re
forming the selection procedures of
the Nominations Committee. Since the
election, COP members have also

given attention to the Honor Code
issue and the establishment of an on
campus drinking facility.
"I think that we've seen more of a
tangible return in terms of actions and
proposals that reflect genuine student
interests from this COP than from any
other since I've been here."said Sen.
Tim Ferguson.
"We've given all we can possibly
give to our campaign issues," said
ASSU President Vic Petroff. "Some of

them were perhaps too ambitious, but
we made good progress on them. Soma
were too much to do in a year. Some of
the things we started are going to be
p' ked up next year and in future
years."
The COP has been "realistic in its
goals," said Sen. Dan
Livingston. "Petroff has been a very
realistic president. I can't criticize him
outside of communication problems. I
don't think communication between
the COP and the senate is all it could
have been."
"Some members of the COP seem to
be infected with the same notions of a
monopoly on wisdom that many
politicians seem to have, and this is
very much at odds with the view of
student government that I have. I tend
to want to trust students to make their
own decisions and to spend their own
money as they please." said Ferguson.
The COP vetoed a Ferguson
sponsored senate bill last week that
would have made salaries for members
of the COP subject to a fee assessment
from the student body.
