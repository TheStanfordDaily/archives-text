U.S. cancels Israeli bomb sale
Washington — The Carter administration will
cancel the sale of a highly controversial bomb to
Israel, U.S. sources said yesterday.
The cancellation of the CBU-72 sale is in line
with strong recommendations by Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance and other State Department
officials.
The CBU-72 is dropped by parachute from a jet
plane. Upon detonation a highly volatile fuel
mixes with air causing a powerful concussive
effect.
The sources who disclosed the planned cancel
lation said the Carter administration decided the
bombs are not essential to Israel's defense and
could impede efforts to reach an over-all Middle
East settlement by angering the Arabs.
Israeli sources say no official word has been
given them about the aborted sale, and they still
hope for approval.
An announcement of the bombdecision will be
delayed at least until after Vance leaves Israel
today and perhaps until his return next week
from his six-nation Middle East tour, the sources
said.
Administration officials say there is little if any
chance for a reversal of the decision. They added
that the only reason the decision has been held
up publicly was to avoid embarrassing Vance
while in the Jewish state.
Vance assured Israel yesterday of an enduring
American commitment to that nation's security
and survival.
The stop in Israel is the first on a week-long
tour that will take Vance to Egypt. Lebanon, Jor
dan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. This is his first visit
to the six countries.
His major preoccupation on his first overseas
mission as secretary of state is expected to be the
question of how to include the Palestinians in
any new Mideast negotiations.
In talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
other Israeli leaders today Vance intends to
explore terms under which Israel would drop its

resistance to negotiating with the Palestine Lib
eration Organization (PLO).
About prospects for a settlement, Vance said:
"Weall know that this will not bean easy task nor
one which will be quickly achieved.'
He said he came to Israel with "one simple
message" — that "the United States is convinced
a fundamental underlying principle of our quest
for peace is the enduring trust and confidence
between our two nations.
"Let there be no question the United States is
deeply committed to the survival and security of
Israel."
In his talks, Vance hopes to persuade Israeli
leaders that a new current of "moderation is
moving through the Arab world.
House pair decries canal plans
Panama City — Two Arizona congressmen
said yesterday it appears that the United States is
planning a "giveaway" of the Panama Canal to
Panama.
They said the canal will continue to be impor
tant to the United States militarily and economi
cally and the American public "is not being told
the whole story" about negotiations for a new
Canal Zone treaty that resumed yesterday.
The representatives, Republican Eldon Rudd
and Democrat Bob Stump, are in Panama with
seven other congressmen examining the Canal
Zone situation and treaty talks.
Panama is demanding sovereignty over the
Canal Zone, over which the United States was
granted permanent control under a 1903 treaty
after America backed independence for Panama
from Colombia.
Stump said that in the talks he has had so far
with U.S. Embassy officials, "it seems that every
thing about a new treaty is now decided — that
it's just a matter of when Panama takes control."
Space shuttle set for Ist test flight
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. — A 747 jumbo

jet with the space shuttle mounted piggyback
atop it roared successfully through the pair's first
moving tests yesterday, reaching a near-takeoff
speed of 157 miles an hour.
Three taxis down this desert test area's 15,000-
foot runway "went quite well," said pilot Fit
zhugh Fulton Jr. "Fortunately, there was no sur
prises."
"It's all go for Friday." when the combo takes
off for the first time, said a NAS A spokesman.
"You couldn't even tell the snuttle was atop
the 747," said Fulton,
The 144,000-pound, 122-foot shuttle, about the
size of a DC-9, is a rocket-airplane hybrid that
will carry man and cargo into orbit. The orbiter
cannot take off by itself, but will be linked with a
rocket when it goes into space, scheduled for
1979. The orbiter can land by itself.
The speed for the first run was 89 miles an
hour. The second was 142 miles an hour. On the
second and on the final run of 157 miles an hour
the jumbo jet's nose was lifted about five feet, a
NASA spokesman said.
Friday's test aloft will be the first of a series of
captive flights designed "to qualify the 747 as the
carrier aircraft," said former astronaut Donald
Slayton, manager of approach and landing tests.
Integration of city schools 'a must'
Washington — Only metropolitan school de
segregation reaching into the white suburbs can
save urban black children from persistent racial
separation in their schools, the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission said yesterday.
"We have concluded that metropolitan school
desegregation is a must if today's children are to
be given equal educational opportunities,"
commission chairman Arthur Flemming told a
news conference as the panel released a report to
President Jimmy Carter and Congress.
"School segregation is most acute in our cities
where the majority of black and Hispanic Ameri
can children live and attend racially isolated
public schools," the commission observed.

In Chicago and Detroit, for example, the public
school enrollment in 1974 was more than 70 per
cent black and other minorities, the report said.
Minority enrollment was more than 60 per cent
in New York and Philadelphia and more than 50
per cent in Los Angeles.
That means, the commission said, that effec
tive school integration cannot be accomplished
within the boundaries of most big cities.
School officials must reach into the white sub
urbs, and they should do so voluntarily without
waiting for court orders, Flemming asserted.
Acknowledging the opposition to busing as a
means of desegregating schools, the commission
said it is wrong to assume that metropolitan de
segregation would mean more busing.
There might actually be less busing in a met
ropolitan plan than in a plan confined to the
central city, the report suggested.
