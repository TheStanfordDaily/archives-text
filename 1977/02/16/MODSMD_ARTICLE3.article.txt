# Lyman: faculty might oppose tenure report
## 
### Kathy Trafton 
Although the report of the ASSU
Task Force on Tenure and Teaching
quality is "very well directed and does
its own lobbying," some faculty op
position can be expected, according to
President Richard Lyman.
Lyman and Task Force Chairman
Larry Diamond, a former ASSU vice
president, appeared on KZSU's Cam
pus Conference last night.
Diamond said faculty and students
should not be polarized on the recom
mendations the task force report pre
sents. The report's main recommenda
tion calls for an evaluation of every
course each time it is taught.
Such recommendations could be
nefit both faculty and students,
Diamond said, pointing out that the
report was compiled by representa
tives of both groups.
Although "every course should be
evaluated every time it is taught," the
forms should not be made public for
experi mental classes and new
teachers, Diamond said.
If students do not take the course
evaluation process very seriously, it
will not work, Diamond said. He noted

that when Princeton instituted univer
sal course evaluations, there was a
high amount of interest.
Now interest there has tailed off, he
said. This "does not reflect decreased
interest in teaching quality, but when
things are running well, you tend to
take things for granted," Diamond
commented. There is a need for con
tinual reminders to students, he said.
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering student
honor society, already administers
mandatory evaluation forms at the en
gineering school. Commenting that
"there's no point in spoiling a good
show," Lyman said the engineering
school evaluations will not be affected
by the recommendations of the task
force.
The engineering students them
selves administer the forms, but be
cause of the volume of work needed to
compile the results from the entire
university, he said, the "students
would not be able to effectively ad
minister such a program."
Second, Tau Beta Pi publishes stu
dent comments but not the data re
sults. The data should be available as a
matter of procedure, said Diamond.
