Is it true that Stanford has "its roots in conven
tional energy" as a former Stanford physicist has
charged?
How much research and education is going on
here in solar energy, currently t he chief alternative to
fossil and nuclear fuel?
The charge was made by Don Aitken, who left
Stanford in 1971 to found the Center for Solar Energy
Applications at San Jose State University (SJSU).
Aitken has set up an environmental studies major
with emphasis in solar energy at SJSU. A master's in
solar energy is offered at UC-Berkeley.
And at Stanford? There are three regular courses
on solar energy.
One course, taught by Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Joel Ferziger, is just for graduate students.
An undergraduate course on designing small
scale alternative energy systems, including solar
energy systems, is taught by Gil Masters, a lecturer in
civil engineering.
Introductory class
An introductory course for undergraduates on
solar energy was offered this fall by Howard Seifert,
professor emeritus of aeronautics and astronautics,

who was called out of retirement to teach the course.
Seifert said he does not know yet whether he will
teach the course again next year. He is part of a
Stanford-Berkeley-Cal Tech-USC team that is bid
ding to get a federal Solar Energy Institute located in
California. If the universities win the bid. Seifert says
he will be busy setting up the Institute.
However, "I imagine somebody will teach it, be
cause it's a rather popular course," said Seifert.
The Aeronautics and Astronautics Department
has not yet set its curriculum for next year, but the
department's academic secretary, Cherry Bobier,
suggested that the Mechanical Engineering Depart
ment might take charge of Seifert's course.
However, Mechanical Engineering Department
Chairman William Reynolds said, "I don't see how
we'll be able to staff that with our present resources."
Energy studies center
Reynolds heads Stanford's Institute for Energy
Studies, which, besides its library and fellowships,
provides seed money for research projects, includ
ing solar energy projects. The Institute gets about
$350,000 from about a dozen sources, among them
General Electric, PG&E and Standard Oil.
Projects by Electrical Engineering Prof. lames
Gibbons and Research Associate Richard Swanson
to improve solar cells have received money from the

Institute. Solar cells convert solar energy directly
into electricity and are currently used chiefly for
space satellites.
Swanson's project is currently funded by the Elec
tric Power Research Institute (a clearinghouse for
utilities' research money) and Gulf Oil.
"Everybody's interested in solar energy," said
Swanson, "even the oil companies, since the oil
companies are going to be out of business in 10
years."
Solar research at Stanford is focused almost exclu
sively on solar cells rather than solar heating and
cooling.
'Commercialization'
"The fundamental knowledge (in solar heating
and cooling) is all there, it's just a matter of commer
cialization," said Gerald Pearson, professor emeritus
of electrical engineering.
Pearson invented the solar cell in 1954 and con
tinues to do research on it, as does Richard Bube,
chairman of Materials Science and Engineering.
Reynolds pointed out that solar heating and cool
ing are low-technology projects. "They're not the
kind of thing that makes for a good Ph.D. disserta
tion."
Research on some local applications of solar heat-
