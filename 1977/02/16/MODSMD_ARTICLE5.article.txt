# Babcock named to post in Justice Department
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Assoc. Law Prof. Barbara Babcock,
the Law School's first and only woman
faculty member, said she is "really ex
cited" about her appointment to the
Civil Division of the U.S. Justice De
partment, which was announced yes
terday by President Jimmy Carter.
"Something I've always wanted to
do is run a huge government agency,"
Babcock said Monday.
She added that she is also pleased
about the appointment for a pedagogi
cal reason. "All my real world experi
ences have fed into my teaching," she
commented.
Babcock went to Washington, D.C.
in mid-January to interview for a
number of federal government posi
tions. She said she had been consi
dered for positions as chief counsel at
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare and chief counsel at the
Defense Department, as well as for the
Justice Department position she fi
nally received.
Babcock credited her selection for
the post not to any previous personal
contact with Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell,
but to the frequent reappearance of her
name on lists of potential nominees for
high positions submitted to the Garter
transition team by black groups, wo
men's groups and groups of law pro
fessors.
"Interest was awakened when my

name kept appearing on all these diffe
rent lists," she said.
The Civil Division of the Justice De
partment, said Babcock, is "the catch
all division of the department, and
handles all the litigation that the gov
ernment brings or answers."
Babcock said she will supervise the
work of 230 lawyers at the division.
She said she feels her administrative
skills will be sufficient to handle the
job because of her experience in run
ning the Public Defenders Office in
Washington, D.C., between 1968 and
1972. She supervised 25 lawyers there
at the beginning of her tenure and 125
by the time she left.
Babcock said that she will encounter
"thousands of pending cases" when
she gets to the Justice Department and
that "establishing priorities will be
among the first things I do." She said
she thought setting priorities would
take a couple of months.
Praise for Bell
babcock said she expects Bell, the
most heavily-criticized of Carter's
Cabinet choices, to be "much better
than anyone expects."
She cited her selection by Bell as
evidence of this. "I'm not a buddy of
his," she noted. "I'm a fairly young
woman who didn't know him at all."
Babcock said she would have been
able to work for women's rights, long
one of her concerns academically and
personally, more directly if she had

been made head of the civil rights divi
sion of the Justice Department.
At the Civil Division, said Babcock,
she would have "much less direct ef
fect" in this field and would not be
able to do much to further the Equal
Rights Amendment, except, she ad
ded, by "being a visible woman."
She said she thought that the wo
men's movement has "really made ter
rific progress," and that "my appoint
ment itself furthers the cause."
There is "every reason to believe
that Carter will keep his promise to put
a lot of women in at the second level"
of the administrative hierarchy, said
Babcock.
Timing
The timing of the appointment is
"not the best," Babcock commented.
She noted that going to Washington
will prevent her from teaching her
"dream class" on "Selected Problems
in the Sixth Amendment," as well as
two other classes she cares about:
"Women and the Law" and "Profes
sional Ethics."
Although her appointment will
leave the Law School without a
woman on the faculty, said Babcock,
the appointments committee has been
working hard to get another woman
professor from outside of its own
ranks.
'"It is not too sanguine to expect that
one other woman" would be ap
pointed by this fall, she said.
Babcock, who was recently recom
mended unanimously by the ap
pointments committee for tenure, will
take a leave of absence from the Law
School for an indefinite period in
order to accept the Justice Depatment
post.
If the new recommended federal sal
ary standards are adopted, said Bab
cock, she will receive $50,000 a year.
That sum is higher than he present sal
ary, Babcock said, but is not more than
she had been making before she came
to the Law School.
Babcock said that although she
looks forward to returning to
Washington, D.C., where she grew up
and where she has "hundreds of
friends and associates," she has "got
ten to love California."
