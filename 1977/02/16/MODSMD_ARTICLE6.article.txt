# Encina Hall remodeling to be completed soon
## 
### Laura Kennedy 
A low-budget remodeling of three
fire-damaged rooms on the first floor
in Encina Hall's east wing should be
completed in a couple of weeks, ac
cording to Elvia Garwood, associate
planner.
New painting, carpeting, wiring and
minor repairs are being done for
around $10,000 to make space for the
benefits section of the Personnel De
partment, she said.
The benefits section of personnel
will be housed at Encina until the Old
Pavilion, personnel's current location,
is remodeled, said Garwood.
Renovation of the Old Pavilion, ac
ross Serra St.from Encina Hall, is ex
pected to take from April to August,
she said.
The rest of personnel will be moved
to rented space on University land,
away from the main campus, Garwood
added.
The east wing of Encina Hall has
been condemned as unsafe since a
1972 fire. Permission has been granted
to use only the first floor by county fire
and building authorities, according to
James Nelson, director of facilities and

properties.
The rest of the first floor has already
been renovated, and is being used by
the Planning and Word Processing
Departments.
After the benefits section of person
nel moves back to the Old Pavilion in
August, the three remodeled rooms in
Encina will probably be used as stor
age space by the Business and Finance
Department.
The top three floors of Encina's east
wing are too badly damaged by fire
and water to be remodeled, said Gar
wood.
The University has plans to eventu
ally gut the whole east wing and re
construct the interior, but this multi
million dollar project is at least five
years away, according to Garwood.
Similar major reconstruction has al
ready been done to the north wing and
the west wing, which houses the Food
Research Institute.
Reconstruction of the east wing
would further the University's objec
tive of modifying all older buildings to
meet present earthquake and safety
standards, and of using space more ef
ficiently.
