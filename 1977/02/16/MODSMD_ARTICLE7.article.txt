## Opinions Editorial Loan poses control problem 
### 
Last week, the Board of Trustees permitted the
establishment of a parent loan program under
which parents with an annual gross income of
between $20,000 and $60,000 could borrow up
to $6000 annually from the University to defer
costs of tuition, room and board. The program
will begin with the class of 1981.
We applaud this decision, though with a few
reservations. In an effort to make money and
serve middle income parents, the program may
fail to meet either goal. The loans are to be a
University investment from which officials ex
pect to receive an eight per cent return.
According to Rodney Adams, director of fi
nance, parent loans may yield a lower return on a
less secure investment than corporate bonds and
notes. This is fine, if the program's intent is
goodwill.
We find it difficult to believe, however, that
lending cheap money to a family with an annual
income of $60,000 is a goodwill gesture. In that

case, the University should charge an interest
rate comparable with any it could receive
elsewhere.
If University aims are purely humanitarian, it
should impose tigher income limits and look at
other aspects of the applicants' financial situa
tion. That way, only families which truly de
monstrate a need for the funds would receive
them.
We also question the University's claim that it
will realize an eight per cent return by charging
an 8.75 per cent interest rate. Assuming all $i
million earmarked for the program is spent, the
University could apply only $7500 toward ad
ministrative costs. Examining numerous Uni
versity programs, we find that considerably large
sums often produce minimal tangible results.
Therefore, we question whether $7500 will
begin to handle costs such as a bad debt reserve
fund, collection costs on delinquent payments,
mailing expenses and bookkeeping.
