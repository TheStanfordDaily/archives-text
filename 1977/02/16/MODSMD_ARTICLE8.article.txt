# SALT II needed now

Last November I voted for Jimmy
Carter because I suspected he would be
more decisive than Gerald Ford had
been about resolving the cruise
missile/backfire bomber impasse
which had hamstrung the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) during
1976.
Last week the Georgian told both the
American people and the leaders of the
Soviet Union that he intends to do pre
cisely that. Unfortunately, what the
president has proposed is that the
issue be dropped altogether. What he
seems to be saying to the Kremlin is,
I "We both want an agreement, right?
Well, to make sure we get one, let's not
discuss anything of significance."
Wait a minute. Where did Carter say
that he wanted to avoid serious
negotiations? Wasn't it the president
who took the initiative by attempting
to get the stalled talks moving towards
' a SALT II agreement? Yes, but leaving
discussion of the cruise missile off the
negotiating agenda raises serious

doubts about the impact such an ag
reement would have on the arms race.
More missiles
It is naive to assume that the Soviets
could not someday develop their own
cruise missiles. Vladivostok, with no
cruise missile restrictions, would
eventually come to "control" launcher
and multiple independent re-entry
vehicle (MIRV) levels but additional
warhead deployment could proceed
unabated.
Since it is warheads and not laun
chers which would fall on cities and
industry, it is naive for Carter to as
sume that prospects for "substantial
reductions" can be enhanced by avoid
ing discussion of this weapon in the
current phase of SALT.
To digress for a moment, U.S. milit
ary planners are developing the
weapon because it is relatively cheap,
it is highly accurate and its air
launched configuration (ACLM),
would greatly enhance a long-range
bomber's ability to penetrate Soviet air
defenses. I am hesitant about it be-

cause if left unrestricted by a SALT II
agreement, its development and de
ployment could render such an ag
reement practically meaningless.
Expiration date
Meaningless? Doesn't the Interim
Agreement on Offensive Weapons ex
pire this year? Don't the two parties
have to reaffirm their commitment to
offensive launcher limitations before
Oct. 3, or risk letting SALT fall
back to ground zero?
Yes, that's true too. If SALT 1 is not
extended, or if the numerical limits
agreed to in the Vladivostock Accord
of 1974 (2400 strategic offensive laun
chers and 1320 MIRV launchers per
side) are not translated into a treaty,
there will be no lateral constraints re
stricting either party's strategic de
ployments.
Standing alone, however, the Vla
divostock numberical limits do very
little to slow the arms race. Granted,
the Soviet Union would have to scrap
some 200 obsolescent missiles in order
to comply with the 2400 launcher
limit. To date, however, the Soviets
have only deployed somewhere bet
ween 100 and 200 MIRVed ICBMs; the
Vladivostock MIRV ceiling would
thus allow them in the neighborhood
of an eightfold buildup from their cur
rent level of MIRV deployment.
U.S. fire power
There is a slack in our own force
levels. A treaty based on Vladivostok
would allow the United States to add
approximately 300 offensive laun
chers, 50 of them MIRVed. This gap is
sufficient to accommodate deploy
ment of 10 Trident submarines —240
MIRVed submarine launched ballistic
missiles (SLBM) —as a supplement to an
already potent Polaris-Poseidon force
(556 SLBMs, 396 of them MIRVed).
Three years ago, the Vladivostok
accord was a hopeful step taken in the
right direction. Today, more sensitive
and more pressing problems have to be
solved. Tabling them for future dis
cussion "if necessary" will not make
their resolution any easier.
The case of MIRV leads one to just
the opposite conclusion. Carter's
negotiating program, which by
excluding the cruise missile ignores
the march of time, might indeed get
SALT moving again. The question is,
which way?

offensive launcher limitations before
Oct. 3, or risk letting SALT fall
back to ground zero?
Yes, that's true too. If SALT 1 is not
extended, or if the numerical limits
agreed to in the Vladivostock Accord
of 1974 (2400 strategic offensive laun
chers and 1320 MIRV launchers per
side) are not translated into a treaty,
there will be no lateral constraints re
stricting either party's strategic de
ployments.
Standing alone, however, the Vla
divostock numberical limits do very
little to slow the arms race. Granted,
the Soviet Union would have to scrap
some 200 obsolescent missiles in order
to comply with the 2400 launcher
limit. To date, however, the Soviets
have only deployed somewhere bet
ween 100 and 200 MIRVed ICBMs; the
Vladivostock MIRV ceiling would
thus allow them in the neighborhood
of an eightfold buildup from their cur
rent level of MIRV deployment.
U.S. fire power
There is a slack in our own force
levels. A treaty based on Vladivostok
would allow the United States to add
approximately 300 offensive laun
chers, 50 of them MIRVed. This gap is
sufficient to accommodate deploy
ment of 10 Trident submarines —240
MIRVed submarine launched ballistic
missiles (SLBM) —as a supplement to an
already potent Polaris-Poseidon force
(556 SLBMs, 396 of them MIRVed).
Three years ago, the Vladivostok
accord was a hopeful step taken in the
right direction. Today, more sensitive
and more pressing problems have to be
solved. Tabling them for future dis
cussion "if necessary" will not make
their resolution any easier.
The case of MIRV leads one to just
the opposite conclusion. Carter's
negotiating program, which by
excluding the cruise missile ignores
the march of time, might indeed get
SALT moving again. The question is,
which way?

Last November I voted for Jimmy
Carter because I suspected he would be
more decisive than Gerald Ford had
been about resolving the cruise
missile/backfire bomber impasse
which had hamstrung the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) during
1976.
Last week the Georgian told both the
American people and the leaders of the
Soviet Union that he intends to do pre
cisely that. Unfortunately, what the
president has proposed is that the
issue be dropped altogether. What he
seems to be saying to the Kremlin is,
I "We both want an agreement, right?
Well, to make sure we get one, let's not
discuss anything of significance."
Wait a minute. Where did Carter say
that he wanted to avoid serious
negotiations? Wasn't it the president
who took the initiative by attempting
to get the stalled talks moving towards
' a SALT II agreement? Yes, but leaving
discussion of the cruise missile off the
negotiating agenda raises serious

doubts about the impact such an ag
reement would have on the arms race.
More missiles
It is naive to assume that the Soviets
could not someday develop their own
cruise missiles. Vladivostok, with no
cruise missile restrictions, would
eventually come to "control" launcher
and multiple independent re-entry
vehicle (MIRV) levels but additional
warhead deployment could proceed
unabated.
Since it is warheads and not laun
chers which would fall on cities and
industry, it is naive for Carter to as
sume that prospects for "substantial
reductions" can be enhanced by avoid
ing discussion of this weapon in the
current phase of SALT.
To digress for a moment, U.S. milit
ary planners are developing the
weapon because it is relatively cheap,
it is highly accurate and its air
launched configuration (ACLM),
would greatly enhance a long-range
bomber's ability to penetrate Soviet air
defenses. I am hesitant about it be-

cause if left unrestricted by a SALT II
agreement, its development and de
ployment could render such an ag
reement practically meaningless.
Expiration date
Meaningless? Doesn't the Interim
Agreement on Offensive Weapons ex
pire this year? Don't the two parties
have to reaffirm their commitment to
offensive launcher limitations before
Oct. 3, or risk letting SALT fall
back to ground zero?
Yes, that's true too. If SALT 1 is not
extended, or if the numerical limits
