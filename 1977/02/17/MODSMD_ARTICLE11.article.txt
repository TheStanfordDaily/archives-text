# Time up for affirmative action
## 
### 
The era of affirmative action prog
rams, for better or worse, appears to be
drawing to a close as a result of recent
Supreme Court decisions. As the
Burger court slowly tones down the
activist judgements of the Warren era
and of the lower courts, we are hope
fully nearing a time when all public
discriminations on the basis of race
will be U.S. history rather than U.S.
policy.
The intent of affirmative action, like
so many -government programs gone
awry, was a noble one. Minorities,
especially blacks, had for years been
discriminated against in the areas ol
housing, employment and education.
In some cases the discrimination was
written directly into the law — race
was a prerequisite for certain
privileges. For the most part, those
laws have been overruled and rei
pealed.
In other cases it has been much more
subtle — social discrimination result
ing from ignorance, prejudice and
ethnocentrism. While the Warren
court made sweeping encroachments
into private conduct attempting to cor
rect these views, il remains a basic fact
that opinion and morality cannot be
legislated nor ajudicated. Only
through education, openmindedness
and a genuine respect for our fellow
man can a society overcome prejudice
and distrust.

The problem was not the intent of
affirmative action but rather its result.
In seeking to preserve the equal protec
tion of the law for all people, judges
and legislatures swung too far, over
corrected and unconstitutionally in
fringed upon the rights of others

through reverse discrimination. Race
again became a qualifying factor in
college admissions, employment and
governmental benefits. Its effect bred
contempt rather than harmony.
The first indication that reverse dis
crimination was coming to an end
came inDeFunis v. Odegaurd in 1974.
Although the case was rendered moot
by a 5-4 vote, it is significant because
of the startling opinion issued by the
courts' most liberal member, William
O. Douglas, who argued, "A segre
gated admissions process creates
suggestions of stigma and caste no less
than a segregated classroom, and in

the end may produce that result de
spite its contrary intentions."
Other decisions followed and in
1976 the court felt forced to point out
what should be obvious: "The central
purpose of the Equal Protection Clause
of the 14th amendment is the preven
tion or official conduct which dis
criminates on the basis of race."
(Washington v. Duvis).
Paralleling this logic, reverse dis
crimination received the first of what
will be a fatal series of blows last year
when the California Supreme Court
ruled in Bnkke v. Regents of the Uni
versity of California that racial clas
sifications in admissions policies in
the UC schools were unconstitutional.
The 6-1 decision was stunning in light
of the fact that the California Supreme
Court is widely recognized as one of
the most liberal in the nation.
With liberals like Douglas and the
California Supreme Court vehemently
rejecting reverse discrimination, it
seems a forgone conclusion that the
more conservative Burger court will
affirm Bnkke in what will be a land
mark decision of the magnitude of
Brown v. Board of Education over 20
years ago.
In affirming Bakke, the court will
show that denying a 21-year-old male
admission to medical school in Davis,
Calif, in 1975 solely because he was
white is as wrong as denying an

8-vear-old girl the right to attend the
school of her choice in Topeka, Kansas
in 1954 solely because she was black.

In so doing, it will say that two
wrongs do not constitute a right; that
one does not gain true freedom at the
expense of another; that equal protec.-
tion of the laws for all persons means
exactly what it says. It will show, in the
words of the first Justice Harlan,
"Our constitution is color blind."
A constitutional government cannot
long stand if its laws are ignored by
those who are entrusted to uphold
them. Until the constitution is
amended or the 14th Amendment is re
pealed, it remains the fundamental
legal norm of our society that the Con
stitution of the United States ought to
be obeyed.
Affirmance of the Bakke decision
will bring this nation closer at last to
fulfilling the dream of the late Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.. who said on
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on
August 28,196.1: "1 have a dream ... it
is a dream that my four little children
will one day live in a nation where
they will not be judged by the color of
their skin but by the content of their
character."
That we commit ourselves to mak
ing that dream a reality should be the
ultimate purpose of our people and of
our laws.
