# Letters: Columbae, broken promises
## 
### 
Columbae
I am one of four freshmen who, disil
lusioned with the dorms, put in the
effort to get into the Columbae com
munity. This house has far surpassed
my hopes and dreams, and has given
me a true sense of community living
and learning. Never before could I
boast of living in a place that was
cliqueless, where 1 could hug and
praise and criticize who 1 pleased;
where people are activists and easily
motivated; where questioning society
is the norm and apathy is the taboo.
Here in Columbae you find love ex
pressed through food and commit
ment through respect. This is a co
operative that is working not only as
an accommodation but through out
theme: social change through non
violence. Our alternative lifestyles lib
rary, the radical resource center, the
Alliance for Radical Change (ARC),
various SWOPSI classes, massage
workshops and people-groups make
Columbae a small society that the Uni
versity can't do without.
Columbae offers me all the things
that this school can not, thus 1 hereby
state that if Columbae is dropped I will
resign from the University to find
another such community elsewhere.

Broken promises
The ASSU Senate's 11-9 vote to up
hold President Vic Petroff's veto of my
"Power of the Pursestrings" bill
should be interesting to those students
concerned about whether senators live
up to the campaign promises they
make each fall.
To review, my bill would have al
lowed students to decide, by fee as
sessment, whether members of the
Council of Presidents (COP) and offic
ers of the Senate are paid, and how
much. Currently they receive $10,070
total each year direct from ASSU
funds.
There are some senators for whom
the ASSU political bureaucracy is a
way of life. That they should oppose
my proposal is expected. Its threat to
their future is clear. Also, that the COP

would veto it is similarly no surprise.
However, you might be interested in
some of the other names who joined in
keeping students from having a direct
say on this matter.
Dan Livingston and Dave Sharp
were elected to the senate after telling
students, "this time, your voice gets
heard. "Livingston, who supported my
proposal in the Senate Finance Com
mittee and joined in the 13-5-1 vote for
its initial passage, told the senate he
was voting to uphold the veto out of
deference to Petroff. Apparently. Pet
roff's voice carries more weight than
the voice of the students, which was so
important to Livingston last fall.
Sharp, who supported my bill in the
By-Laws Committee and also voted a
week ago to pass it, opted to uphold
the veto after Petroff tracked him down
for a lobbying session the day of the
meeting. Petroff must be a persuasive
man to be heard above the voices of
12,000 students.
Jeff Stoler and Barry Parr of the
Hammer and Coffin (H&C) Society,
which alluded to ASSU politicos last
fall with the campaign theme "Send
Them A Message," voted to uphold the
veto and force students to continue
financing those same ASSU politicos.
H&C's Roy Skogstrom and Tom De
vine were absent from Tuesday's meet
ing. though I'm sure they were aware
that the veto override was pending.
One of the main points made by up
holders of the veto Tuesday night was
that the senate is elected by students to
be their representative in matters such
as salary, and should decide the issue
itself.
After electing people like
Livingston, Sharp, Stoler and Parr,
who abandoned their platforms on so
key an issue, students might find the
"elected representatives" point a
small consolation, indeed.

Electoral College
In 1824, Andrew Jackson received
41.34 per cent of the popular vote but
failed to win a majority of the Electoral

College. John Quincy Adams, who re
ceived only 30.92 per cent, was elected
president in the House of Representa
tives vote that followed.
In 1876, Samuel Tilden gained 50.97
per cent of the popular vote. Ruther
ford Hayes, who received only 47.95
per cent, won an Electoral College
majority and became president.
And in 1888, Grover Cleveland re
ceived 100,000 votes more than Ben
jamin Harrison, only to be trounced in
the Electoral College, 233-168.
I wouldn't bother to mention these
largely forgotten historical tidbits, ex
cept that Sue Lesjak made the incredi
ble claim that only one president who
failed to win a popular plurality was
elected as a result of the Electoral Col
lege in her recent defense of the in
stitution (Daily, Feb. 8).
While I suggest she take a crack at a
history book before she attempts her

next exposition on public affairs, there
is a larger issue here that justifies her
blunder.
The Daily opinions page presuma
bly provided her and Jack Bogdanski
space in order to enlighten the Stan
ford community about the Electoral
College and in allowing such an obvi
ous error to sail through, the Daily
opinions editors showed either their
own ignorance of history or else an
ignorance of their journalistic duty in
failing to rectify the error.

Hammer and Coffin (H&C) Society,

H&C's Roy Skogstrom and Tom De
vine were absent from Tuesday's meet
ing. though I'm sure they were aware
that the veto override was pending.
One of the main points made by up
holders of the veto Tuesday night was
that the senate is elected by students to
be their representative in matters such

itself.
After electing people like
Livingston, Sharp, Stoler and Parr,

key an issue, students might find the
"elected representatives" point a
small consolation, indeed.

Electoral College
In 1824, Andrew Jackson received
41.34 per cent of the popular vote but
failed to win a majority of the Electoral

College. John Quincy Adams, who re
ceived only 30.92 per cent, was elected
president in the House of Representa
tives vote that followed.
In 1876, Samuel Tilden gained 50.97
per cent of the popular vote. Ruther
ford Hayes, who received only 47.95
per cent, won an Electoral College
majority and became president.
And in 1888, Grover Cleveland re
ceived 100,000 votes more than Ben
jamin Harrison, only to be trounced in
the Electoral College, 233-168.
I wouldn't bother to mention these
largely forgotten historical tidbits, ex
cept that Sue Lesjak made the incredi
ble claim that only one president who
failed to win a popular plurality was
elected as a result of the Electoral Col
lege in her recent defense of the in
stitution (Daily, Feb. 8).
While I suggest she take a crack at a
history book before she attempts her

next exposition on public affairs, there
is a larger issue here that justifies her
blunder.
The Daily opinions page presuma
bly provided her and Jack Bogdanski
space in order to enlighten the Stan

own ignorance of history or else an
ignorance of their journalistic duty in
failing to rectify the error.

Columbae
I am one of four freshmen who, disil
lusioned with the dorms, put in the
effort to get into the Columbae com
munity. This house has far surpassed
my hopes and dreams, and has given
me a true sense of community living
and learning. Never before could I
boast of living in a place that was
cliqueless, where 1 could hug and
praise and criticize who 1 pleased;
where people are activists and easily
motivated; where questioning society
is the norm and apathy is the taboo.
Here in Columbae you find love ex
pressed through food and commit
ment through respect. This is a co
operative that is working not only as
an accommodation but through out
theme: social change through non
violence. Our alternative lifestyles lib
rary, the radical resource center, the
Alliance for Radical Change (ARC),
various SWOPSI classes, massage
workshops and people-groups make
Columbae a small society that the Uni
versity can't do without.
Columbae offers me all the things
that this school can not, thus 1 hereby
state that if Columbae is dropped I will
resign from the University to find
another such community elsewhere.

The ASSU Senate's 11-9 vote to up
hold President Vic Petroff's veto of my
"Power of the Pursestrings" bill
should be interesting to those students
concerned about whether senators live
up to the campaign promises they
make each fall.
To review, my bill would have al
lowed students to decide, by fee as
sessment, whether members of the
Council of Presidents (COP) and offic
ers of the Senate are paid, and how
much. Currently they receive $10,070
total each year direct from ASSU
funds.
There are some senators for whom
the ASSU political bureaucracy is a
way of life. That they should oppose
my proposal is expected. Its threat to
their future is clear. Also, that the COP

would veto it is similarly no surprise.
However, you might be interested in
some of the other names who joined in
keeping students from having a direct
say on this matter.

students, "this time, your voice gets

was voting to uphold the veto out of
deference to Petroff. Apparently. Pet
roff's voice carries more weight than
the voice of the students, which was so
important to Livingston last fall.
Sharp, who supported my bill in the
By-Laws Committee and also voted a
week ago to pass it, opted to uphold
the veto after Petroff tracked him down
for a lobbying session the day of the

munity. This house has far surpassed
my hopes and dreams, and has given
me a true sense of community living
and learning. Never before could I
boast of living in a place that was
cliqueless, where 1 could hug and
praise and criticize who 1 pleased;
where people are activists and easily
motivated; where questioning society
is the norm and apathy is the taboo.
Here in Columbae you find love ex
pressed through food and commit
ment through respect. This is a co
operative that is working not only as
an accommodation but through out
theme: social change through non
violence. Our alternative lifestyles lib
rary, the radical resource center, the
Alliance for Radical Change (ARC),
various SWOPSI classes, massage
workshops and people-groups make
Columbae a small society that the Uni
versity can't do without.
Columbae offers me all the things
that this school can not, thus 1 hereby
state that if Columbae is dropped I will
resign from the University to find
another such community elsewhere.

Broken promises
The ASSU Senate's 11-9 vote to up
hold President Vic Petroff's veto of my
"Power of the Pursestrings" bill
should be interesting to those students
concerned about whether senators live
up to the campaign promises they
make each fall.
To review, my bill would have al
lowed students to decide, by fee as
sessment, whether members of the
Council of Presidents (COP) and offic
ers of the Senate are paid, and how
much. Currently they receive $10,070
total each year direct from ASSU
funds.
There are some senators for whom
the ASSU political bureaucracy is a
way of life. That they should oppose
my proposal is expected. Its threat to
their future is clear. Also, that the COP

would veto it is similarly no surprise.
However, you might be interested in
some of the other names who joined in
keeping students from having a direct
say on this matter.
Dan Livingston and Dave Sharp
were elected to the senate after telling
students, "this time, your voice gets
heard. "Livingston, who supported my
proposal in the Senate Finance Com
mittee and joined in the 13-5-1 vote for
its initial passage, told the senate he
was voting to uphold the veto out of
deference to Petroff. Apparently. Pet
roff's voice carries more weight than
the voice of the students, which was so
important to Livingston last fall.
Sharp, who supported my bill in the
By-Laws Committee and also voted a
week ago to pass it, opted to uphold
the veto after Petroff tracked him down
for a lobbying session the day of the
meeting. Petroff must be a persuasive
man to be heard above the voices of
12,000 students.
Jeff Stoler and Barry Parr of the
Hammer and Coffin (H&C) Society,
which alluded to ASSU politicos last
fall with the campaign theme "Send
Them A Message," voted to uphold the
veto and force students to continue
financing those same ASSU politicos.
H&C's Roy Skogstrom and Tom De
vine were absent from Tuesday's meet
ing. though I'm sure they were aware
that the veto override was pending.
One of the main points made by up
holders of the veto Tuesday night was
that the senate is elected by students to
be their representative in matters such
as salary, and should decide the issue
itself.
After electing people like
Livingston, Sharp, Stoler and Parr,
who abandoned their platforms on so
key an issue, students might find the
"elected representatives" point a
small consolation, indeed.

Electoral College
In 1824, Andrew Jackson received
41.34 per cent of the popular vote but
failed to win a majority of the Electoral

College. John Quincy Adams, who re
ceived only 30.92 per cent, was elected
president in the House of Representa
tives vote that followed.
In 1876, Samuel Tilden gained 50.97
per cent of the popular vote. Ruther
ford Hayes, who received only 47.95
per cent, won an Electoral College
majority and became president.
And in 1888, Grover Cleveland re
ceived 100,000 votes more than Ben
jamin Harrison, only to be trounced in
the Electoral College, 233-168.
I wouldn't bother to mention these
largely forgotten historical tidbits, ex
cept that Sue Lesjak made the incredi
ble claim that only one president who
failed to win a popular plurality was
elected as a result of the Electoral Col
lege in her recent defense of the in
stitution (Daily, Feb. 8).
While I suggest she take a crack at a
history book before she attempts her

next exposition on public affairs, there
is a larger issue here that justifies her
blunder.
The Daily opinions page presuma
bly provided her and Jack Bogdanski
space in order to enlighten the Stan
ford community about the Electoral
College and in allowing such an obvi
ous error to sail through, the Daily
opinions editors showed either their
own ignorance of history or else an
ignorance of their journalistic duty in
failing to rectify the error.
