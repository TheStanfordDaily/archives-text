# Mandatory insurance policy set up for foreign students
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Starting this September, all students who are not
permanent U.S. residents or citizens must enter
the University's "high level" insurance program,
according to a letter to foreign students from Dean
of Graduate Studies W. Bliss Carnochan and Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
To be registered for autumn quarter, these stu
dents will have to join the extended insurance
plan, which offers students coverage on a group
basis for health and accidents, the letter stated.
In making this coverage mandatory, Stanford
joins a trend occuring at other universities in the
country where similar coverage has been availa
ble, according to the letter, which was sent out this
week.
The trend stems partly from the increasing
number of foreign students enrolling in American
colleges, said Lee Zeigler, director of the Bechtel
International Center. Although students who are
U.S. citizens have ready access to funds to handle
emergency medical fees (through personal insur
ance, family, or welfare), he said, foreign students
need insurance coverage because they are far from
such sources of protection.
Zeigler explained that the insurance coverage is
required because foreign students "have no bac
kup. They only have limited places to go to collect.
There is also enough incidence to warrant insur

ance."
Foreign students are not allowed to receive pub
lic welfare if an emergency arises, and most do not
have parents or families that could afford the high
charges of doctors, hospitals or other services, the
letter said.
The new registration process will include the
insurance payment as a quarterly fee, according to
the letter. The coverage may also be expanded to
include protection for family members or spouses,
the letter stated. The premiums for the group in
surance presently cost $27.03 a quarter, said the
letter, but premiums fluctuate, and no rate has been
forecast for autumn quarter.
The early notice about the change in insurance
requirements was given because "we needed to do
it (make the transition to compulsory insurance) in
an orderly way," Zeigler explained.
The advance notification and registration bil
ling system will make it easier for students to get
sponsors to pay, he said.
In the past, sponsors of foreign students have
been hesitant to pay for insurance without a Uni
versity bill, according to the letter. Under the new
program, this reluctance should be greatly di
minished, the letter stated.
The letter said students may waive the insurance
coverage if any agency which represents them,
such as an embassy, consulate or government de
partment, provides such protection.
