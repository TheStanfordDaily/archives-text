# International space mission approved

Washington (AP) — An
American scientist and a Euro
pean scientist will fly in orbit to
gether when the first Spacelab is
launched in 1980. the National
Aeronautics Space Administra
tion said yesterday.
The flight will be the second
international space mission for
the United States. In 1975, three
American astronauts linked up
in space with a Russian ship car
rying two cosmonauts.
Three other Americans will fly
on the first Spacelab mission.
They will be the two pilots and
the flight engineer who will man
the U.S.-built Space Shuttle,
which is to ferry the Spacelab
into orbit from Cape Canaveral,
Fla.
The two scientists are to work
different shifts so that experi
ments can continue 24 hours a
day during the week-long test of
the big laboratory. They will
orbit 155 miles above the earth.
The Spacelab will remain at

tached to the Shuttle during the
mission. On later flights the
Shuttle will deposit the
Spacelab in space and return up
to 30 days later to bring it back to
earth. As many as four scientists,
including all-foreign teams, will
occupy the lab on these later
trips.
The American scientist will be
selected by NASA, the other by
the European Space Agency
(ESA), an 11-nation group. The
scientists won't have to undergo
rigorous astronaut training and
they'll work in a shirtsleeve at
mosphere.
The scientific team will be
selected a year or so before the
flight. The European scientist
will come from one of the ESA
nations — Belgium, Denmark,
France, Great Britain, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland and West
Germany.
