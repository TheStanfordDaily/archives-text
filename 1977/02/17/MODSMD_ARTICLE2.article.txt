# Energy-saving contract expected
## Buildings may be modified 
### Laura Kennedy 
A $242,699 construction contract to
make six major campus buildings
more energy-efficient should be
signed by the end of this week, accord
ing to Ole Christensen, facilities en
gineer. ,
The ventilation systems and chilled
water valving and controls will be
modified in the Mitchell Earth Sci
ences Building, theGraduate School of
Business, Jordan Hall, the McCullough

Building (physics), the Durand Build
ing and the research and teaching
wings of the Herrin Biology Building,
he said.
Work on these modifications should
start next week and take about four
months to complete, according to
Christensen.
Ventilation systems in the buildings
will occasionally have to be closed
down while modifications are being
made, said Christensen. But, he added,
the shutdowns would last no longer
than two or three hours at a time Ac
tivities can go on as usual during these
shutdowns, he said.
Over budget
The University received bids for this
contract two months ago, but has not
yet signed a contract because the low
est bid was over budget, said Christen
sen.
Redwood Mechanical's bid of
$337,192 was whittled down to
$242,699 by cutting out "modifica
tions to existing systems which were
not energy conserving in and of them
selves," said Christensen.
Cuts included added ventilation for
computer rooms in Jordan Hall and
modification of existing ductwork in
Herrin Building.
The University's original budget al
located $280,000 to construction for
this project and a separate project to
improve the flexibility of the steam

heating for three of these buildings.
The second project is already being
carried out by Redwood Mechanical at
a total cost of $87,500.
Original budget
The original total budget (which in
cluded both projects) was $424,000.
The current total budget for just the
first project is $400,650.
Energy savings from this modifica
tion project are expected to pay back
its costs in less than four years, said
Christensen.
To complete energy modifications
of these six buildings, air balancing
will be carried out this summer at an
estimated cost of $60,000-$BO,OOO,
said Christensen.
Balancing — regulating the amount
of air entering a ventilation system —
is not an energy-saving change in it
self, said Christensen, but "it has to be
done to make the whole thing work.
It's like the tuneup on your car."
Energy studies have been completed
on six other campus buildings, and a
program of modifications is currently
being formulated, according to Peter
Hopf. facilities engineer coordinator.
Modifications should be carried out
over the summer, said Hopf. The six
buildings are Meyer Library, Wilbur
Hall, the Law School, the Math Corner,
the Stanford Center for Research and
Development in Teaching and the Var
ian Laboratory (physics).
