# Bowman offers contact services
## Students gain career information 
### Sue Lesjak 
One of the many student ser
vices Bowman Alumni Associa
tion offers is the Alumni Contact
service. No, this isn't contact as
in contact lenses or contact as in
massage parlor kind of contact.
Rather, the contact offered to
students is an informational ex
change with Stanford alumni.
The program enables students to
benefit from the experience of
alumni who have been out in
the professional world.
The service gives students the
opportunity to learn more about
their potential career choices by
talking with professionals in
their fields of interest.
"It's a way for students to find
out what it's really like (in the
professional world) while still in
school," Ramsay McGee, head of
Student Services for Bowman
Alumni Association, said.
Over 350 alumni who
graduated either recently or way
back have volunteered to dis
cuss their careers with students.
Areas of expertise include en
gineering, media, law, advertis
ing, government, education and
medicine. They total 20
categories in all.
The alums who have volun
teered are an impressive bunch.
A sample of alumni listed in
the file include: a Boston Globe
reporter, a Boeing 707 captain
for American Airlines, the re
tired vice president of Standard
Oil Co. of California, an intelli
gence officer, a criminal lawyer
and the president of California
State University. The file's only

weakness is that many career
areas are scantily represented or
simply not represented at all.
The file is kept with the recep
tiunist at Bowman Alumni
Center. "Students just come in
and tell us what they're in
terested in and they're given the
file. It is then up to the student to
contact the alumnus and arrange
a meeting," McGee said.
Considering that the program
has only been in operation one
year, it has worked well, accord
ing to McGee. "Quite a few stu
dents use the service although
not nearly as many as 1 hope will
in the future."
Since last spring quarter she
estimates that about 200-250
students have used the file. "Not
all, however, find what they're
looking for," McGee said.
"Because we are just taking
alumni volunteers, our file is
lacking in some professional
areas," McGee said. In the future
she hopes to solicit more alum
ni. One of the problems with
the current file is the distance
between many alumni homes
and the Stanford campus. Vol
unteers are scattered across the
country and the world. This
geographical spread is nice be
cause it doesn't limit career in
formation to the Bay Area. How
ever, the obvious pitfall is that

the average student can't afford
to fly to Hong Kong for the
weekend to chat with the Stan
ford alumnus foreign ambas
sador.
Prior to last year, the Alumni
Association made all appoint
ments for the student; there was
no file. This "worked reasonably
well," recalls McGee, "but it li
mited the number of students we
could accomodate. It took sev
eral hours to process each stu
dent."
McGee says she prefers the
present program developed last
year by senior class president
Walt Spevak. "Students can now
look through the file whenever
they like and they often stumble
upon an appealing career they
hadn't considered."
Irma Nogales, soon to take
over McGee's post as head of
student services, described the
Contact Service as a "fantastic
resource." She stressed the value
of contacts in the professional
world because "you don't know
how hard it is getting a job until
you're out there."
The service is designed to be
strictly informational, though,
according to McGee. Stu
dents should not use the file ex
pecting to land a job. All job
placement is left to the Place
ment Center. If we contacted

only alumni who were poten
tial employers, "we'd be limit
ing our contacts immensely,"
McGee said.
"Of course, if the student and
alum hit it off, the student may
have made a valuable reference
or contact for future job hunt
ing," McGee said.

ever, the obvious pitfall is that

the average student can't afford
to fly to Hong Kong for the
weekend to chat with the Stan
ford alumnus foreign ambas
sador.
Prior to last year, the Alumni
Association made all appoint
ments for the student; there was
no file. This "worked reasonably
well," recalls McGee, "but it li
mited the number of students we
could accomodate. It took sev
eral hours to process each stu
dent."
McGee says she prefers the
present program developed last
year by senior class president
Walt Spevak. "Students can now
look through the file whenever
they like and they often stumble
upon an appealing career they
hadn't considered."
Irma Nogales, soon to take
over McGee's post as head of
student services, described the
Contact Service as a "fantastic
resource." She stressed the value
of contacts in the professional
world because "you don't know
how hard it is getting a job until
you're out there."
The service is designed to be
strictly informational, though,
according to McGee. Stu
dents should not use the file ex
pecting to land a job. All job
placement is left to the Place
ment Center. If we contacted

only alumni who were poten
tial employers, "we'd be limit
ing our contacts immensely,"
McGee said.
"Of course, if the student and
alum hit it off, the student may
have made a valuable reference
or contact for future job hunt
ing," McGee said.
One of the many student ser
vices Bowman Alumni Associa
tion offers is the Alumni Contact
service. No, this isn't contact as
in contact lenses or contact as in
massage parlor kind of contact.
Rather, the contact offered to
students is an informational ex
change with Stanford alumni.
The program enables students to
benefit from the experience of
alumni who have been out in
the professional world.
The service gives students the
opportunity to learn more about
their potential career choices by
talking with professionals in
their fields of interest.
"It's a way for students to find
out what it's really like (in the
professional world) while still in
school," Ramsay McGee, head of
Student Services for Bowman
Alumni Association, said.
Over 350 alumni who
graduated either recently or way
back have volunteered to dis
cuss their careers with students.
Areas of expertise include en
gineering, media, law, advertis
ing, government, education and
medicine. They total 20
categories in all.
The alums who have volun
teered are an impressive bunch.
A sample of alumni listed in
the file include: a Boston Globe
reporter, a Boeing 707 captain
for American Airlines, the re
tired vice president of Standard
Oil Co. of California, an intelli
gence officer, a criminal lawyer
and the president of California
State University. The file's only

weakness is that many career
areas are scantily represented or
simply not represented at all.
The file is kept with the recep
tiunist at Bowman Alumni
Center. "Students just come in
and tell us what they're in
terested in and they're given the
file. It is then up to the student to
contact the alumnus and arrange
a meeting," McGee said.
Considering that the program
has only been in operation one
year, it has worked well, accord
ing to McGee. "Quite a few stu
dents use the service although
not nearly as many as 1 hope will
in the future."
Since last spring quarter she
estimates that about 200-250
students have used the file. "Not
all, however, find what they're
looking for," McGee said.
"Because we are just taking
alumni volunteers, our file is
lacking in some professional
areas," McGee said. In the future
she hopes to solicit more alum
ni. One of the problems with
the current file is the distance
between many alumni homes
and the Stanford campus. Vol
unteers are scattered across the
country and the world. This
geographical spread is nice be
cause it doesn't limit career in
formation to the Bay Area. How
