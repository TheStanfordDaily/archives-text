# 'Master Robert' leaves his mark on mankind

It is squeezed in between a
hair-dressing salon and a laun
dromat.
The word TATTOO in bold
face lettering stares out from the
wide expanse of plate glass win
dow.
On the raised platform inside
the shop, a solitary hulk of a
man, sporting an Elliot Gould
mustache, slouches spread
eagle in his chair, engrossed in
the breezy maneuverings of
Capt. James T. Kirk and the Star
ship Enterprise.
The interior of Palo Alto's first
and only tattoo parlor is surpris

ingly unpretentious. In the
words of its proprieter, "Master
Robert" Benedetti, it resembles a
"combination beauty parlor/
doctor's office."
Plastered on the white cement
walls are numerous tattoo de
signs, as well as photographs of
an occasional breast or thigh of a
satisfied customer, replete with
epidermic array.
Benedetti insists that his
method of tattooing is unique
because he draws the design
freehand on the skin instead of
tracing from a stencil as most tat
tooists do. This method pro
duces a better tattoo, according

to Benedetti, because it "blends
with the shape and contour of
the skin."
Although he says he's been
fascinated with the art since his
childhood, Benedetti first en
tered the world of tattoos three
years ago. His new part-time
career (he works during the day
as a hairdresser) has become a
source of friction between him
and his mother.
"She refuses to come by the
shop or even look at my own tat
toos," he says. "I've always got
to keep my shirt on around her or
else she gets very upset."
Benedetti's own body has a
special design which extends
over his whole back, curling
down his upper thigh. He dis
plays it proudly, although it's
not complete. Every three weeks
he flies to Los Angeles to have
one of his friends there work on
it.
His tattoos reflect, as do many
of his 3000 original designs, the
influence of the Orient on his art.
Fire-breathing dragons curve
around his lower back while
heinous goblins smirk from his
shoulder blade.
What is his reaction to strange
looks on the beach? "I love
them," he grins with a toss of his
brown mane.
On the personal side, he says
that those close to him "find my
tattoos highly erotic." He has no
prejudices about tattoo-less
dates.
However, he relates, "If we
have a serious relationship, they
usually end up with one. But I
don't do it."
In general, about 40 to 50 per
cent of a tattooist's clientele are
women, says Benedetti, but
about 70 per cent of his custom
ers have been women. He says he
feels this is partially because, as
a hairdresser, he's learned to
"really relate to women." Most
women, according to Benedetti,
tend to get tattoos that are
"small, hidden and usually
highly symbolic to them."
The most popular designs
among women tend to be but
terflies, flowers and tiny rain

bows. "Guys usually get more
into power symbols," says Be
nedetti, "like dragons and vari
ous other mythological crea
tures."
Benedetti says he refuses to
become involved in trying to at
tach symbolism to various tat
toos.
"If 1 did," he says,"I would go
crazy trying to figure out what
this piece and that one meant
and whether it fit in with what I
thought the personality ut the
individual was like."
One of the more unusual tat
toos that he has seen has politi
cal overtones to it.
"A friend of mine has this tat
too of Nixon in a bathtub, on his
leg," says Benedetti. "The
bathtub is being carried on a
wave, right next to this baby on a
surf board. Further down there
was a topless lady facing the
other way with three oranges
clustered around her knee. 1 re
member it because I colored in
one of the oranges, but I never
did try to figure out what it all
meant."
Benedetti refuses to tattoo
anything he considers anti
social, obscene or radical.
"I won't do anything unless I
consider it to be artistic and a
challenge," he says. "I'd rather
do something that's real art than
have lots of customers flocking
to my door. I'm not like most tat
tooists; the symbolism that I
work with is a bit more obscure
than Mom and Apple Pie."

"Master Robert" certainly
doesn't have hordes of ardent
customers flocking to his door.
Since the shop opened in De
cember, he's averaged one cus
tomer a day.
The customers do not fit the
stereotyped picture of a person
with a tattoo. Instead of burly,
macho truckdrivers, the last
three customers who walked

into the parlor were a dentist, a
dental assistant and a young girl.
Tattoos area minimum of $25,
with Benedetti charging about
$50 for an hour of his expertise.
He's had no art training what
soever and learned his trade by
logging 40 to 50 hours on the
telephone with a master tattooist.
Like most of his fellow artists.
Benedetti manufactured his own
equipment. He says he uses
complete hospital-like steriliza
tion in his tattooing procedure
and has received nn complaints
from any of his customers about
resulting infections or disease.
Infection, especially
hepatitus, is highly possible, he
admits, especially with tattoists
who are careless about cleaning
their needles.
The procedure of tattooing is
relatively simple. Sterilized
toothpicks are used to sketch the
design on the skin. Then with
his "electric paintbrush" (a clus
ter of three vibrating needles
which enter the skin), the tattoist

places the pigment underneath
the dermis, the sensitive layer of
skin beneath the epidermis.
According to Benedetti, the
pain factor is "directly related to
the skill of the tattooist. If you are
a real artist, you don't care about
how much it hurts, what con
cerns you is how the skin itself
reacts. A butcher just grinds it in
there and you're just as likely to
end up with a scar as a tattoo "
Usually, he says, the pain is at
most a stinging sensation.
Tattoos have come to play a
relatively major role in Benedet
ti's life in a short time. Ile spends
much of his time looking for
ideas for new designs; his
friends are, for the most part,
other tattooists and he attends
tattoo conventions. Even his dog
has a tattoo — a Japanese water
demon — on her belly.
But Benedetti remains prag
matic and down-to-earth about
his trade.
"I don't have any fantasies
about tattoos," he says.
