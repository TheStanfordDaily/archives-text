# Mendicants offer soothing harmony

Eleven men gather in silence around a Don
ner lounge coffee table littered with scraps of
the San Francisco Chronicle. One of them is
wearing the top half of a baseball jersey and
very short shorts. Another has his down vest on
backwards.
All eyes are fixed on the group leader's up
raised hands. Suddenly they break into song.
"Get in touch with God.
Turn your radio on,
(click, adds an amorphous voice).
Turn your radio on!"
This could be the staff of the Stanford
Chaparral or a hunch ot well-tuned Zenith
salesmen.
But no, these are the Mendicants. Stanford's
all-male, mostly a capella vocal group, caught
at one of their twice-weekly practice sessions.
The tune they've just finished is a 1930s theme
from radio station VVGOD in Waco. Texas.
Who are these guys, anyway, and why are
they singing about radios?
Four-part harmony
The Mendicants are an independent student
organization of 15 singers (the number varies
from year to year) which, from mid-autumn to
mid-spring, performs about once a week in
dorms and at special functions off campus.
They sing a wide variety of mostly original ar
rangements. accompanying about a third of
their repertoire with guitar, bass or harmonica,
but depending mainly on four-part harmonies.
"We try to balance it between things we know
people will dig and get into like the Dead and
the Beach Boys . . . and things to keep it a vari
ety group like 16th century madrigals." says
Randy Tucker, the group's director.
Through the years, the Mendicants have per
formed over 130 different songs, including
such oddities as "Turn Your Radio On."
"By far the biggest, most popular song the
Mendicants have ever done is i Get Around,' "
Tucker adds.
Judging from the audience's rapt attention
and enthusiastic response at last week's Flor
ence Moore concert, the Mendicants put on a
good show. They may be appealing partly be
cause clear, precise harmonies are novel and
soothing to rocked-out eardrums. It may also be

because the Mend icants si ng as if they're barely
suppressing broad grins.
"They've got such enthusiasm — they look
like they have a good time with what they're
doing," says one listener.
"The basic philosophy of the group," exp
lains Tucker, "is to have as much fun as possi
ble and to be as good as possible without sac
rificing one for the other."
Spootin whifts
The Mendicants have had what seems to be
both a fun and productive history. Formed in
1963 by a handful of students from the East
Coast, the Stanford group was fashioned after
such institutions as the Whiffenpoofs of Yale
and the Nassoons of Princeton. The name Men
dicants, which means "beggars," was chosen
from such suggestions as the Redskins and the
Spoofinwhiffs.
The early groups imitated the Eastern groups
in dress (coat and tie) and material. They sang
mostly glee club tunes, as well as something
called a "pinning song" (ask your mother what
"pinning" is).
The clean-cut, traditional image of the group
was appealing to alumni during those days of
campus radicalism, and even today the Men
dicants often entertain at alumni functions. It
was supposedly 1973 before they had a member
who "looked like a hippie."
The group's first concert was given during a
dinner at Branner (then a women's dorm), and
apparently during a solo in the song "A Fellow
Needs a Girl," one of the women started crying.
Ah, the sentimental 60s.
Since then, the Mendicants have developed a
style of their own. They wear "what they have
on" and sing whatever appeals to members of
the group. They have performed in such varied
locations as a swimming pool (drained), the
Renaissance Faire and the aisles of a landing
jetliner, as well as on KCBS radio as part of Big
Game festivities.
Chart-buster
Since the Mendicants give most concerts free,
they began, in 1964, to make records as a
method of generating funds. The first disc con
tained such hits as "Mickey Mouse" and sold
1000 copies in two weeks. The group is cur
rently working on record number eight.

Any money the Mendicants make goes to a
fund which finances future records, excursions
and — the Stanford Inevitable — parties.
"It's always a problem finding a happy
medium between having a good time and put
ting out high quality music," says concert man
ager Scott Miller, who has been a Mendicant for
four years. But he seems to think that the re
wards far outweigh the problems.
"It's a great bunch of guys, and it's good
music without all the bureaucratic hassles of
the University. It's informal but the music's still
high quality because people who are in the
group really want to do it."
Tryouts are held in the fall, and this year's
turnout (43) was the largest ever. Returning
members choose recruits on the basis of vocal
and theory ability, at the same time trying to
maintain bass, baritone and first and second
tenor sections. Two women have auditioned in
the group's 14 year history, but they were re
jected because their voices didn't "blend" with
the all-male sound.
All members are or were at one time students
here, but the philosophy is "Once a Mendicant,
always a Mendicant," and graduated or return
ing singers are welcomed. Each is granted the
dubious title "Old Fart."
Traditions
The Mendicants seem to be well-integrated
into the community. Members have been
known to make lewd remarks, to gather at the
Oasis and to flunk exams because of all the time
they have devoted to the group. They have
managed to survive independent of the Univer
sity since their inception, with a brief dissolu
tion in 1970 due to membership problems.
John Gordon, a former member who pro
duced a written history of the Mendicants,
wrote that traditions were instilled in the Men
dicants as "a means of keeping the group alive
and selfvperpetuating." But those traditions,
like formal dress, have declined.
"The group is really being perpetuated by the
music itself," wrote Gordon.
That music, coupled with the Mendicants'
unique style, may be well described by Director
Tucker's introduction to the Beatles' song "Be
cause."
It's the Moonlight Sonata played backwards.
