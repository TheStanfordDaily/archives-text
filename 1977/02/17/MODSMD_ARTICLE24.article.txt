# Students solicit scholarship funds

What have a student body
president, a varsity golfer, an
editor of the Daily and a winner
of the National Hearst Newswrit
ing Award had in common?
They might not have attended
Stanford at all if the Heritage
Fund didn't exist.
The Heritage scholarship fund
is raised each year by a student
group, the Heritage Fund volun
teers. Since 1955 they have
given scholarships to some 200
men and women who might
otherwise have been unable to
afford to study here.
"It started as a Senior Heritage
given to the freshman and
sophomore classes," explains
Audrey Berkovitz, director of
student development for the
General Secretary's office and an
active supporter of the Heritage
Fund. The program was estab
lished to help bring potential
leaders to Stanford. Today's 34
volunteers are undergraduates
from all four classes.
All gifts to the Heritage Fund
are turned over to the Office of
Financial Aids. That office as
sesses the extent of each stu
dent's need and awards a full or
partial scholarship accordingly.
The only restriction is that reci
pients be either freshmen or
sophomores.
Small companies
Since 1955 Heritage Fund
volunteers have raised over
$350,000. Last year's drive net
ted almost $25,000 and provided
12 students with scholarships.
This year's goal is $30,000 for 15
students. Volunteers start their
Northern California solicitation
next Tuesday, and will hit
Southern California around
April 15.
The volunteers raise money by
calling on companies around the
Bay and in Los Angeles. Their
primary focus is small com
panies on the Peninsula like A-l
Liquors, Ming's of Palo Alto and
Ricky's Hyatt House because "no
one is going to them," explains
Berkovitz.
"Most of these Peninsula
companies take advantage of
Stanford for their business,"
says Berkovitz. "They should be
given a chance to support the
University."
According to Berkovitz the
Heritage Fund's solicitation bat
ting average is "very good." Last
year volunteers visited 100
companies and obtained 3 0
donors.
Mike Levinthal, Heritage
Fund chairman, attributes his
group's success to two factors.
Volunteers are "raising money
for the person who sits next to us
in class," he says,"and they are
sure every dollar will be put into
scholarship funds im
mediately."
The volunteers call on com
panies in pairs, each pair making
about six visits. Each volunteer
works a total of 5-10 hours (with
the exception of the chairman,
whose job, says Berkovitz, might

as well be full-time).
This year, "we have more vol
unteers than we've ever had,'
comments Levinthal. Most of the
volunteers hear about the or
ganization through friends or by
word of mouth. "We don't put
out a cry for volunteers," he says.
Several of this year's volunteers
were Heritage scholars them
selves, although there is no pres
sure on them to join.
Hearing old stories
The group prefers a "soft-sell'
approach with potential donors,
Berkovitz and Levinthal explain.
"It works better for us than the
cold, factual approach," says
Berkovitz. "A lot of the people
we go to have put themselves
through school so they are sym
pathetic to student needs," adds
Levinthal. "Students are always
received well."
"Most of the people really like
seeing students," says Levint
hal. "They enjoy our en
thusiasm. We often deal with old
alums who don't have much
contact with the University and
want to hear what's happening
on campus now. We usually end
up hearing some old stories ol
theirs, too. It's a neat feeling, in
that regard."
The number of companies
who donate annually is impres
sive. Over the years the Heritage
Fund has developed quite a re
pertoire of companies to call on.
Among the strongest suppor
ters are Ming's of Palo Alto,
Peninsula Creamery and Penin
sula Newspapers. They are all
currently donating $1000 or
more and have been contribut
ing since 1955. The most dif
ficult problem, declares Levint
hal, is finding new companies.
Timing
"We try to avoid people who
get hit several times," says Lev
inthal. "Sometimes we'll know
of a great prospect but we'll
avoid calling on them, because
we know the University is sol
iciting the same company for a
larger amount " Levinthal exp
lains they wouldn't want toblow
a million dollar gift for a few
thousand. "Timing is impor
tant," affirms Berkovitz.
"We ask each company to con
sider contributing a set amount
of money, at least $100. It's not
that we won't accept smaller do
nations, but we want to get
people a little more committed.
Once a company's in the $100
range you usually see an in
crease from year to year."
In contrast to today's volun
teers who go after the big bucks,
past Heritage volunteers went
after small donations. In 1955,
$7000 was amassed largely from
$25 gifts.
In addition to helping fellow
students, Heritage volunteers
also reap personal gain from
their experience. "I've acquired
a lot more self-confidence by cal
ling on corporate executives,"
says Levinthal. "It turned out to
be a really valuable aid when I
interviewed for jobs."

approach with potential donors,
Berkovitz and Levinthal explain.
"It works better for us than the
cold, factual approach," says
Berkovitz. "A lot of the people
we go to have put themselves
through school so they are sym
pathetic to student needs," adds
Levinthal. "Students are always
received well."
"Most of the people really like
seeing students," says Levint
hal. "They enjoy our en
thusiasm. We often deal with old
alums who don't have much
contact with the University and
want to hear what's happening
on campus now. We usually end
up hearing some old stories ol
theirs, too. It's a neat feeling, in
that regard."
The number of companies
who donate annually is impres
sive. Over the years the Heritage
Fund has developed quite a re
pertoire of companies to call on.
Among the strongest suppor
ters are Ming's of Palo Alto,
Peninsula Creamery and Penin
sula Newspapers. They are all
currently donating $1000 or
more and have been contribut
ing since 1955. The most dif
ficult problem, declares Levint
hal, is finding new companies.
Timing
"We try to avoid people who
get hit several times," says Lev
inthal. "Sometimes we'll know
of a great prospect but we'll
avoid calling on them, because
we know the University is sol
iciting the same company for a
larger amount " Levinthal exp
lains they wouldn't want toblow
a million dollar gift for a few
thousand. "Timing is impor
tant," affirms Berkovitz.
"We ask each company to con
sider contributing a set amount
of money, at least $100. It's not
that we won't accept smaller do
nations, but we want to get
people a little more committed.
Once a company's in the $100
range you usually see an in
crease from year to year."
In contrast to today's volun
teers who go after the big bucks,
past Heritage volunteers went
after small donations. In 1955,
$7000 was amassed largely from
$25 gifts.
In addition to helping fellow
students, Heritage volunteers
also reap personal gain from
their experience. "I've acquired
a lot more self-confidence by cal
ling on corporate executives,"
says Levinthal. "It turned out to
be a really valuable aid when I
interviewed for jobs."

They might not have attended
Stanford at all if the Heritage

The Heritage scholarship fund
is raised each year by a student
group, the Heritage Fund volun
teers. Since 1955 they have
given scholarships to some 200
men and women who might
otherwise have been unable to
afford to study here.
"It started as a Senior Heritage
given to the freshman and
sophomore classes," explains
Audrey Berkovitz, director of
student development for the
General Secretary's office and an
active supporter of the Heritage
Fund. The program was estab
lished to help bring potential
leaders to Stanford. Today's 34
volunteers are undergraduates
from all four classes.
All gifts to the Heritage Fund
are turned over to the Office of
Financial Aids. That office as
sesses the extent of each stu
dent's need and awards a full or
partial scholarship accordingly.
The only restriction is that reci
pients be either freshmen or
sophomores.
Small companies
Since 1955 Heritage Fund
volunteers have raised over
$350,000. Last year's drive net
ted almost $25,000 and provided
12 students with scholarships.
This year's goal is $30,000 for 15
students. Volunteers start their
Northern California solicitation
next Tuesday, and will hit
Southern California around
April 15.
The volunteers raise money by
calling on companies around the
Bay and in Los Angeles. Their
primary focus is small com
panies on the Peninsula like A-l
Liquors, Ming's of Palo Alto and
Ricky's Hyatt House because "no
one is going to them," explains
Berkovitz.
"Most of these Peninsula
companies take advantage of
Stanford for their business,"
says Berkovitz. "They should be
given a chance to support the
University."
According to Berkovitz the
Heritage Fund's solicitation bat
ting average is "very good." Last
year volunteers visited 100
companies and obtained 3 0
donors.
Mike Levinthal, Heritage
Fund chairman, attributes his
group's success to two factors.
Volunteers are "raising money
for the person who sits next to us
in class," he says,"and they are
sure every dollar will be put into
scholarship funds im
mediately."
The volunteers call on com
panies in pairs, each pair making
about six visits. Each volunteer
works a total of 5-10 hours (with
the exception of the chairman,
whose job, says Berkovitz, might

as well be full-time).
This year, "we have more vol
unteers than we've ever had,'
comments Levinthal. Most of the
volunteers hear about the or
ganization through friends or by
word of mouth. "We don't put
out a cry for volunteers," he says.
Several of this year's volunteers
were Heritage scholars them
selves, although there is no pres
sure on them to join.

lished to help bring potential
leaders to Stanford. Today's 34
volunteers are undergraduates
from all four classes.
All gifts to the Heritage Fund
are turned over to the Office of
Financial Aids. That office as
sesses the extent of each stu
dent's need and awards a full or
partial scholarship accordingly.
The only restriction is that reci
pients be either freshmen or
sophomores.
Small companies
Since 1955 Heritage Fund
volunteers have raised over
$350,000. Last year's drive net
ted almost $25,000 and provided
12 students with scholarships.
This year's goal is $30,000 for 15
students. Volunteers start their
Northern California solicitation
next Tuesday, and will hit
Southern California around
April 15.
The volunteers raise money by
calling on companies around the
Bay and in Los Angeles. Their
primary focus is small com
panies on the Peninsula like A-l
Liquors, Ming's of Palo Alto and
Ricky's Hyatt House because "no
one is going to them," explains
Berkovitz.
"Most of these Peninsula
companies take advantage of
Stanford for their business,"
says Berkovitz. "They should be
given a chance to support the
University."
According to Berkovitz the
Heritage Fund's solicitation bat
ting average is "very good." Last
year volunteers visited 100
companies and obtained 3 0
donors.
Mike Levinthal, Heritage
Fund chairman, attributes his
group's success to two factors.
Volunteers are "raising money
for the person who sits next to us
in class," he says,"and they are
sure every dollar will be put into
scholarship funds im
mediately."
The volunteers call on com
panies in pairs, each pair making
about six visits. Each volunteer
works a total of 5-10 hours (with
the exception of the chairman,
whose job, says Berkovitz, might

as well be full-time).
This year, "we have more vol
unteers than we've ever had,'
comments Levinthal. Most of the
volunteers hear about the or
ganization through friends or by
word of mouth. "We don't put
out a cry for volunteers," he says.
Several of this year's volunteers
were Heritage scholars them
selves, although there is no pres
sure on them to join.
Hearing old stories
The group prefers a "soft-sell'
approach with potential donors,
Berkovitz and Levinthal explain.
"It works better for us than the
cold, factual approach," says
Berkovitz. "A lot of the people
we go to have put themselves
through school so they are sym
pathetic to student needs," adds
Levinthal. "Students are always
received well."
"Most of the people really like
seeing students," says Levint
hal. "They enjoy our en
thusiasm. We often deal with old
alums who don't have much
contact with the University and
want to hear what's happening
on campus now. We usually end
up hearing some old stories ol
theirs, too. It's a neat feeling, in
that regard."
The number of companies
who donate annually is impres
sive. Over the years the Heritage
Fund has developed quite a re
pertoire of companies to call on.
Among the strongest suppor
ters are Ming's of Palo Alto,
Peninsula Creamery and Penin
sula Newspapers. They are all
currently donating $1000 or
more and have been contribut
ing since 1955. The most dif
ficult problem, declares Levint
hal, is finding new companies.
Timing
"We try to avoid people who
get hit several times," says Lev
inthal. "Sometimes we'll know
of a great prospect but we'll
avoid calling on them, because
we know the University is sol
iciting the same company for a
larger amount " Levinthal exp
lains they wouldn't want toblow
a million dollar gift for a few
thousand. "Timing is impor
tant," affirms Berkovitz.
"We ask each company to con
sider contributing a set amount
of money, at least $100. It's not
that we won't accept smaller do
nations, but we want to get
people a little more committed.
Once a company's in the $100
range you usually see an in
crease from year to year."
In contrast to today's volun
teers who go after the big bucks,
past Heritage volunteers went
after small donations. In 1955,
$7000 was amassed largely from
$25 gifts.
In addition to helping fellow
students, Heritage volunteers
also reap personal gain from
their experience. "I've acquired
a lot more self-confidence by cal
ling on corporate executives,"
says Levinthal. "It turned out to
be a really valuable aid when I
interviewed for jobs."
What have a student body
president, a varsity golfer, an
editor of the Daily and a winner
of the National Hearst Newswrit
ing Award had in common?
They might not have attended
Stanford at all if the Heritage
Fund didn't exist.
The Heritage scholarship fund
is raised each year by a student
group, the Heritage Fund volun
teers. Since 1955 they have
given scholarships to some 200
men and women who might
otherwise have been unable to
afford to study here.
"It started as a Senior Heritage
given to the freshman and
sophomore classes," explains
Audrey Berkovitz, director of
student development for the
General Secretary's office and an
active supporter of the Heritage
Fund. The program was estab
lished to help bring potential
leaders to Stanford. Today's 34
volunteers are undergraduates
