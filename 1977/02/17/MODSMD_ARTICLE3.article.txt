# University offers study at UC Africa
## 
### Emily Sachar 
The Overseas Studies Office and the
University of California Education Ab
road program have worked out an ar
rangement that will permit two Stan
ford students to study with the UC
programs in Africa next year. In turn,
UC students will travel to Stanford's
overseas campus in Vienna.
The IJC programs are located at the
University of Nairobi in Kenya and the
University of Chana in Accra.
"We wanted to figure out ways that
the two schools could work together,"
said Corb Smith, assistant director of
Overseas Studies. "UC had programs
where we did not and we had centers
where they did not. Over the last year
and-a-half, we've been working out the
various problems connected with a
program of this type."
The University will pay for a stu
dent's airfare to Africa and for an
orientation program abroad, but will
not pay tuition or living expenses.
A student's total costs for the year in
Africa are estimated to be about $7500,
including tuition, room and board, re
turn transportation and personal and
travel expenses. This compares to
about $7100 on campus here in 1977-
78. not including travel and transpor
tation.
Eligibility
Current sophomores and juniors
who will be returning for at least two
quarters following completion of the
year abroad may apply. Stanford stu
dents will remain fully enrolled at
Stanford while studying abroad.
Students who receive financial aid
from the University may apply for aid
for the year abroad, said Smith, as long
as they are able to show continued
need for aid.
Students will be selected by a com
mittee whose members will include
David Abernethy. chairman of the
Committee on African Studies,
graduate students from Africa, a rep
resentative from the Overseas Studies
Office and individuals from depart
ments related to African studies.
The committee will be looking for
students who show evidence of being
able to adjust to different cultures, said
Smith "Students will need to show
emotional stability and strong person
ality traits," he said.
Two letters of recommendation will
be required. Applicants must show a
strong interest in African studies, but
need not be African studies majors,
said Smith.
Deadline
The deadline for submitting appli
cations is Feb. 28, he said.
Because neither Stanford nor UC
wanted to lose tuition, several problem
areas needed attention, according to
Smith.
"We've worked out an exchange of
administrative services and costs with

UC," said Mark Mancail, overseas
studies director. "They will send two
of their students to our program in
Vienna tor every one of our students
we send to their programs in Africa.
That reflects their greater administra
tive cost in Africa."
Application forms and information
flyers will be available in the Overseas
Studies Office, the Afro-American
studies program office (Hldg. 30 in the
Quad) and the office of the secretary to
the Committee on African Studies, Ro
gers House, second floor.

Because neither Stanford nor UC
wanted to lose tuition, several problem
areas needed attention, according to
Smith.
"We've worked out an exchange of
administrative services and costs with

UC," said Mark Mancail, overseas
studies director. "They will send two
of their students to our program in
Vienna tor every one of our students
we send to their programs in Africa.
That reflects their greater administra
tive cost in Africa."
Application forms and information
flyers will be available in the Overseas
Studies Office, the Afro-American
studies program office (Hldg. 30 in the
Quad) and the office of the secretary to
the Committee on African Studies, Ro
gers House, second floor.
The Overseas Studies Office and the
University of California Education Ab
road program have worked out an ar
rangement that will permit two Stan
ford students to study with the UC
programs in Africa next year. In turn,
UC students will travel to Stanford's
overseas campus in Vienna.
The IJC programs are located at the
University of Nairobi in Kenya and the
University of Chana in Accra.
"We wanted to figure out ways that
the two schools could work together,"
said Corb Smith, assistant director of
Overseas Studies. "UC had programs
where we did not and we had centers
where they did not. Over the last year
and-a-half, we've been working out the
various problems connected with a
program of this type."
The University will pay for a stu
dent's airfare to Africa and for an
orientation program abroad, but will
not pay tuition or living expenses.
A student's total costs for the year in
Africa are estimated to be about $7500,
including tuition, room and board, re
turn transportation and personal and
travel expenses. This compares to
about $7100 on campus here in 1977-
78. not including travel and transpor
tation.
Eligibility
Current sophomores and juniors
who will be returning for at least two
quarters following completion of the
year abroad may apply. Stanford stu
dents will remain fully enrolled at
Stanford while studying abroad.
Students who receive financial aid
from the University may apply for aid
for the year abroad, said Smith, as long
as they are able to show continued
need for aid.
Students will be selected by a com
mittee whose members will include
David Abernethy. chairman of the
Committee on African Studies,
graduate students from Africa, a rep
resentative from the Overseas Studies
Office and individuals from depart
ments related to African studies.
The committee will be looking for
students who show evidence of being
able to adjust to different cultures, said
Smith "Students will need to show
emotional stability and strong person
ality traits," he said.
Two letters of recommendation will
be required. Applicants must show a
strong interest in African studies, but
need not be African studies majors,
said Smith.
Deadline
The deadline for submitting appli
cations is Feb. 28, he said.
