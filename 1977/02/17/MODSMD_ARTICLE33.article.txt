## classical music/Peter Stamos Violinist Phillips: a romantic 
### 
There were definite hints of a
romantic revival on the Stanford
campus last Friday night as
Daniel Phil lips performed an ex
cellent rendition of violin reper
toire. In a memorable concert
sponsored by the Lively Arts, the
22 year old violinist from New
York mixed a fine technique, a
well mastered style and a
genuine love for music.
Phillips, a graduate of julliard
and winner of the Young Con
cert Artists International Com
petition, chose selections from
Bach, Mozart, Ysayle,
Wieniawski and Kriesler.
The concert began with a
melodious piece from Mozart.
The work moved rhythmically
with a majestic downbeat and
smooth flow. Phillips seemed to
grasp the audience, using clear,
precise intonation and incre
mentally growing in confidence
and presence.
The depth of this young vio
linist became quickly apparent.
Almost shy and reluc
tant walking on stage, as soon as
Phillips began to play his
strength grew.
The violin seemed to become a
part of him, as, closing his eyes,
he buried himself in the many
intricacies of Bach.
Through the ;\l iemande,
Courante and Sarabunde Phil
lips displayed a seasoned ap
proach to the lusty phrasing of
Bach. Rushing through the Bach
jig he lost some of the key
phrases but an impressive
technique throughout the
movements carried him over any
difficulties.
The Chaconne, the final
movement of this Bach partita,
was the highlight of the first half
of the concert. Perhaps the most
challenging piece of music ever
written, the Chuconne is a vio
linist's greatest test — a per
former's Matterhorn.
A constant struggle and yet a
growing love, the emotions run
freely from human drama to re
ligious pain and exultation. It is
Bach's musical account of the
"Sermon on the Mount."
In the works of Fritz Kriesler,
the romantic elements of the vio
lin emerged.
Kreisler's music is sentimen
tal romance in the highest form,
and to do justice to this neoclas
sic composition requires the
romantic flair of an Arthur
Rubinstein on the piano or an
Andres Segovia on the guitar.
Indeed, since Fritz Kreisler per
formed these works himself in
the 19405, few violinists have
succeeded in portraying the
depth and beauty of the romantic
violin.
Intonation was impeccable,

but it was the enlightened musi
cal interpretation and harmoni
ous double stops of the kreisler
pieces that brought shouts for
more. Phillips pulled an emo
tionally deep sound during the
slower movements, and com
pletely dazzled the audience
with his remarkable speed and
accuracy reminiscent of the pro
ficiency of Jascha Heifetz.

At times Phillips showed
signs of fatigue and strain, and
an occasional phrase was lost
due to youthful impatience. But
Daniel Phillips exhibited tre
mendous potential and a
noteworthy amibition to rekin
dle the works of Kreisler.
Called back for three encores
Phillips chose again to reach
into the realm of romance —

Rachmaninov. a variation of
Beethoven and again Kreisler.
The audience seemed to sway
with every musical call as the
violin sang out the notes of
another Kreisler love song.
In these days of synthesized
electric "music," it was truly
heartwarming to see such a
young, fresh face doing honor to
Kreisler's romance.

with every musical call as the
violin sang out the notes of
another Kreisler love song.
In these days of synthesized
electric "music," it was truly
heartwarming to see such a
young, fresh face doing honor to
Kreisler's romance.

There were definite hints of a
romantic revival on the Stanford
campus last Friday night as
Daniel Phil lips performed an ex
cellent rendition of violin reper
toire. In a memorable concert
sponsored by the Lively Arts, the
22 year old violinist from New
York mixed a fine technique, a
well mastered style and a
genuine love for music.
Phillips, a graduate of julliard
and winner of the Young Con
cert Artists International Com
petition, chose selections from
Bach, Mozart, Ysayle,
Wieniawski and Kriesler.
The concert began with a
melodious piece from Mozart.
The work moved rhythmically
with a majestic downbeat and
smooth flow. Phillips seemed to
grasp the audience, using clear,
precise intonation and incre
mentally growing in confidence
and presence.
The depth of this young vio
linist became quickly apparent.
Almost shy and reluc
tant walking on stage, as soon as
Phillips began to play his
strength grew.
The violin seemed to become a
part of him, as, closing his eyes,
he buried himself in the many
intricacies of Bach.
Through the ;\l iemande,
Courante and Sarabunde Phil
lips displayed a seasoned ap
proach to the lusty phrasing of
Bach. Rushing through the Bach
jig he lost some of the key
phrases but an impressive
technique throughout the
movements carried him over any
difficulties.
The Chaconne, the final
movement of this Bach partita,
was the highlight of the first half
of the concert. Perhaps the most
challenging piece of music ever
written, the Chuconne is a vio
linist's greatest test — a per
former's Matterhorn.
A constant struggle and yet a
growing love, the emotions run
freely from human drama to re
ligious pain and exultation. It is
Bach's musical account of the
"Sermon on the Mount."
In the works of Fritz Kriesler,
the romantic elements of the vio
lin emerged.
Kreisler's music is sentimen
tal romance in the highest form,
and to do justice to this neoclas
sic composition requires the
romantic flair of an Arthur
Rubinstein on the piano or an
Andres Segovia on the guitar.
Indeed, since Fritz Kreisler per
formed these works himself in
the 19405, few violinists have
succeeded in portraying the
depth and beauty of the romantic
violin.
Intonation was impeccable,

but it was the enlightened musi
cal interpretation and harmoni
ous double stops of the kreisler
pieces that brought shouts for
more. Phillips pulled an emo
tionally deep sound during the
slower movements, and com
pletely dazzled the audience
with his remarkable speed and
accuracy reminiscent of the pro
ficiency of Jascha Heifetz.

At times Phillips showed
signs of fatigue and strain, and
an occasional phrase was lost
due to youthful impatience. But
Daniel Phillips exhibited tre
mendous potential and a
noteworthy amibition to rekin
dle the works of Kreisler.
Called back for three encores
Phillips chose again to reach
into the realm of romance —

Rachmaninov. a variation of
Beethoven and again Kreisler.
The audience seemed to sway
with every musical call as the
violin sang out the notes of
another Kreisler love song.
In these days of synthesized
electric "music," it was truly
heartwarming to see such a
young, fresh face doing honor to
Kreisler's romance.
