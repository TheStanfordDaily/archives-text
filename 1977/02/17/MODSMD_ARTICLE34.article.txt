## Jim Page to perform 
### 
When the Seattle police de
partment requested permission
for the use of hollow point and
.357 magnum bullets as standard
equipment in 1975, the city
council considered two issues:
the fiscal and political cost of
new expenditures versus the be
nefits of appeasing law and
order enthusiasts.
For Jim Page, folk-poet, street
singer and populist advocate,
there was another and more dis
turbing concern. Hollow point
bullets, used successfully by
police forces in high crime
neighborhoods and by military
forces in far distant, long forgot
ten foreign wars, have an un
usual side effect: after the bullet
enters the body, the hollow head
mushrooms against the internal
tissues it displaces creating an
ever widening hole. The target,
guilty or innocent, faces more
than incapacitation and capture.
Without judge or jury, he re
ceives an automatic sentence,
mutilation at best, death at
worst.
Jim Page, in a folk tradition
nearly lost, in thestepsofWoody
Guthrie and Pete Seeger,
gathered a coalition of political

groups, concerned citizens, and
worried parents, flooded the city
council chambers and con
fronted the chief of police eye
to-eye with an unregistered
weapon: the deadly protest and
satire of a folksong.
It was, in the words of one city
council member, "one of the
wildest meetings in memory."
Page lost that battle in Seattle,
but he won something else. He
had taken another step in earn
ing the respect and enthusiasm
of a growing audience through
out the Pacific Northwest, for
both political courage and musi
cal competence â€” a rare combi
nation.
Born in Palo Alto, Page has
spent the last 10 years traveling
throughout the Northwest and
Northeast, performing in the
backstreets of Seattle, in the
nightclubs of San Jose, on uni
versity campuses, at city council
meetings, at rallies and de
monstrations. Turning down of
fers from major recording com
panies (among them Columbia),
he has completed, at long last,
two albums in the past year: A
Shot of the Usual and On the

Street Again (released by VVhid-
Isle Records, Page's own label).
His songs are based on bis
immediate experiences and re
collections, from the "ideas that
people have given me on the
road, from talking about things"
that concern his audiences.
Some of his songs touch on na
tional issues: The Great Alaska
Oil Hush discusses the impact of
the new oil pipeline; Madame
Atom satirizes Washington Gov.
Dixie Lee Kay's (ex-chairperson
of the Atomic Energy Commis
sion) obsessive commitment to
nuclear power; Price is on the
Rise evaluates the impact of in
flation ("a nickel is a nickel, a
dime is a dime, a dollar is thirty
five cents"). Other songs, such as
Stone Bruise, are simple tunes
about walking too far, for too
long, on reluctant feet.
For his audiences, however, it
is Page's engaging musical style
and guitarwork that allow him a
powerful vehicle for folk songs
"that can be enjoyed, by old and
young," and that carry both a
message and a melody.
Page will be performing this
Saturday at 8 p.m. at Tresidder
Lounge.
