(Chaparral Film Series.)
One of the great Marx Brot hers
films, complete with Zeppo.
* * *
The Blue Angel. Cermany,
1930. (Dept. of German Studies.)
Directed by Josef von
Sternberg.
This classic among classics
depicts the love affair between
an authoritarian schoolteacher
(Emil Jannings), and a provoca
tive cabaret singer (Marlene
Dietrich). With minimal
dialogue, von Sternberg effec
tively conveys the aesthetic ex
pression through mood.

Colour of Ritual, Colour of
Thought. 1964. (Women's Film
Series.)
Directed by Storm De Hirsch.
A poet, as well as filmmaker,
De Hirsch's films embody the in
tegral relationship of these two
arts. She approaches her art as "a
voyage into buried continents of
the self, an exploration into
out-of-bounds areas of no-time,
new space." Although a woman,
she believes art to be a reflection
of the universal soul, charac
terized as neither male nor
female. (Showing on a double
bill with Sambizanga.)

II Grido. Italy, 1957. (Italian
Film Series.)
Directed by Michelangelo An
tonioni.
This early Antonioni film
traces a man's love-forsaken,
emotional crisis, cinematog
raphically reflected in his hope
less journey through Italy's Po
Valley. In the director's own
words: "I wanted to use the
landscape to express his
psychology."
* * *
McCube &■ Mrs. Miller. USA.
(Law School Film Society.)
Directed by Robert Altman,
with Warren Beatty and Julie
Christie.
This hauntingly beautiful film
is less a work of literary sub
stance and more the expression
of a mood. Aided by exquisite
cinematography and the harrow
ing music of Leonard Cohen,
Altman takes us into the ara
tional through this aesthetic ex
perience.
* * *
Ninotchku. USA, 1939. (Stan
ford Film Society.)

Directed by Ernst Lubitsch.
The Shanghai Express. USA.
1931.
Directed by Joset von
Sternberg.
Two classic films from the
thirties, with a pair ol Hol
lywood's most elegant ladies:
Greta Garbo as Ninotchka, and
the incomparable Marlene Diet
rich as Shanghai Lily.
Sambizanga. 1972. (Women's
Eilm Series.)
Directed by Sarah Maldoror.
Set during the beginning years
of Angola's struggle for inde
pendence, the film is an observa
tion of a woman and the rise of
her political consciousness, as
she sets out to find her husband,
who has been missing ever since
his arrest by the secret police.
(Showing on a double-bill with
Colour of Ritual, Colour of

Casanova. Italy, 1977. (Off
campus.)
Directed by Eederico Fellini,
with Donald Sutherland.
Although "freely drawn" from
Casanova's autobiography, Eel
lini's newest film is not so much
about the great lover's life, or
even a study of his personality.
Rather, it is an impressionistic
patchwork of sequences, cast
amidst an almost surreal, dream
like mood. A wealth of visual
expression. Casanova repre
sents a very unique style of
cinema, even for Fellini, and is
thus loaded with those wonder
ful Eelliniisms.
* * *
Network. USA, 1976. (Off
campus.)
Directed bv Sidney Lumet,
with Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch
and William Holden.
A kaleidoscopic, behind-the
scenes vision of a fictitious but
all-too-real television network.
Paddy Chayefsky's intricate
screenplay forms an interesting
blend of satire and serious social
statement with such a subtle di
vision between the real and the
surreal that some viewers may
discredit this film as "unrealis
tic." More importantly though,
is the effect created by this com
bination of exaggeration, distor
tion and veritable reflection.

Casanova. Italy, 1977. (Off

Directed by Eederico Fellini,
with Donald Sutherland.
Although "freely drawn" from
Casanova's autobiography, Eel
lini's newest film is not so much
about the great lover's life, or
even a study of his personality.
Rather, it is an impressionistic
patchwork of sequences, cast
amidst an almost surreal, dream
like mood. A wealth of visual
expression. Casanova repre
sents a very unique style of
cinema, even for Fellini, and is
thus loaded with those wonder

Paddy Chayefsky's intricate
screenplay forms an interesting
blend of satire and serious social
statement with such a subtle di
