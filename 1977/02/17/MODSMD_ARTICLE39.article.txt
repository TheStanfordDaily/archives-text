## Jackson Browne/in concert 
### 
His dark gaze, expressive and
seemingly omniscient, reveals
Jackson Browne, the Legend.
And his performance last Wed
nesday night at the San Jose
Center for the Performing Arts
confirmed it.
The songs he selected for his
share of the Save the Whales Be
nefit included his most visio
nary poetry, such as "For
Everyman," "Rock Me on the
Water" and"The Pretender." He
presented his romantic ideology
with overwhelming sincerity,
and appeared to reflect on the
meaning of e\ ery word, some
times becoming too choked up to
continue during his more
melancholy ballads.
Browne's music contributes as
much to the magic as do his
lyrics. His fluid voice contained
none of the nasal tone for which
it has been criticized.
In the instrumental arrange
ments, beautiful and intricate,
each musician was free to de
monstrate his individual skill
and imagination. "Something
Fine" contained a delicate, emo
tional interplay between Browne
on the acoustic guitar and David
Lindley on the violin.
Involvement characterized the
evening. Browne took part not
only in his own work, but also in
the efforts of each member of the
band.
He also concentrated on the
technical coordination, motion

ing to the stage crew if the effects
did not satisfy him. With such
personal direction, the group
tried their best . . . and suc
ceeded.
The mood was warm and re
laxed, suffused with a sense of
The Cause. Browne, his band,
and the other performers, in
cluding ).D. Souther, Warren
Zevon, Waddy Wachtel and a
Shiu Izumea, a Japanese artist,
joked with each other and with
the audience.
For a few hours backstage
Jackson Browne became real. He
kissed babies, reminisced with
long-estranged friends, and
wore comfortably baggy shirts.

Stars, roadies, and guests
shared beer and munchies in the
wings, as observers hugged
those around them, albeit stran
gers, in this atmosphere of help
ing society. All stood in awe of
Jackson, the "Great Song
Traveler."
Finally, Browne gave an im
passioned plea for both the
whales and nuclear safeguards,
declaring, "We got raped on
Proposition 15!" He summed up
the general spirit in a poignant
version of "Before the Deluge,"
with the line, "We got to live to
gether 'til the light that's lost
within us reaches the skv."

wings, as observers hugged
those around them, albeit stran
gers, in this atmosphere of help
ing society. All stood in awe of
Jackson, the "Great Song
Traveler."
Finally, Browne gave an im
passioned plea for both the
whales and nuclear safeguards,
declaring, "We got raped on
Proposition 15!" He summed up
the general spirit in a poignant
version of "Before the Deluge,"
with the line, "We got to live to
gether 'til the light that's lost
within us reaches the skv."
His dark gaze, expressive and
seemingly omniscient, reveals
Jackson Browne, the Legend.
And his performance last Wed
nesday night at the San Jose
Center for the Performing Arts
confirmed it.
The songs he selected for his
share of the Save the Whales Be
nefit included his most visio
nary poetry, such as "For
Everyman," "Rock Me on the
Water" and"The Pretender." He
presented his romantic ideology
with overwhelming sincerity,
and appeared to reflect on the
meaning of e\ ery word, some
times becoming too choked up to
continue during his more
melancholy ballads.
Browne's music contributes as
much to the magic as do his
lyrics. His fluid voice contained
none of the nasal tone for which
it has been criticized.
In the instrumental arrange
ments, beautiful and intricate,
each musician was free to de
monstrate his individual skill
and imagination. "Something
Fine" contained a delicate, emo
tional interplay between Browne
on the acoustic guitar and David
Lindley on the violin.
Involvement characterized the
evening. Browne took part not
only in his own work, but also in
the efforts of each member of the
band.
He also concentrated on the
technical coordination, motion

ing to the stage crew if the effects
did not satisfy him. With such
personal direction, the group
tried their best . . . and suc
ceeded.
The mood was warm and re
laxed, suffused with a sense of
The Cause. Browne, his band,
and the other performers, in
cluding ).D. Souther, Warren
Zevon, Waddy Wachtel and a
Shiu Izumea, a Japanese artist,
joked with each other and with
the audience.
For a few hours backstage
Jackson Browne became real. He
kissed babies, reminisced with
long-estranged friends, and
wore comfortably baggy shirts.

Stars, roadies, and guests
shared beer and munchies in the
wings, as observers hugged
those around them, albeit stran
gers, in this atmosphere of help
ing society. All stood in awe of
Jackson, the "Great Song
Traveler."
Finally, Browne gave an im
passioned plea for both the
whales and nuclear safeguards,
declaring, "We got raped on
Proposition 15!" He summed up
