# Health insurance proposal expected before end of year
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” President
|immy Carter said yesterday he will be
ready to propose the first step toward a
national health insurance program
"before the end of this year."
The president's remark to employes
of the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare (HEW) appeared to
move up the Carter administration's
timetable for fulfilling Carter's cam
paign promise to work for a federal
health insurance plan for all Ameri
cans.
In a related development, HEW is
proposing that a new government
agency be set up with authority to limit
rising health care costs.
Carter's statement on the timing of
his health insurance proposals comes
against the background of previous
statements by administration officials
cautioning against any expectations
that Carter would emphasize his
health program early in his administ
ration.
Plan must wait
Instead, they have said such a plan
would have to await a sturdy economic
recovery to generate needed revenues.
At a news conference Jan. 26, HEW
Secretary Joseph Califano Jr. said, "I do
not see how we can submit a well
thought-through national health in
surance proposal to the Congress until
next year."
Carter, speaking to about 500
employes selected from the 140,000
employes in HEW, said yesterday that
his administration will seek to put into
effect a "year-by-year progression to
ward a national health insurance sys
tem."
Any progression could mean expan
sion of the two existing programs, fed
erally run Medicare for the elderly and
federally supported but state
administered Medicaid for the poor.
'Catastrophic coverage'
One possible starting point was
suggested last month in a report from
the congressional budget office which

said so-called "catastrophic coverage"
could be extended to families with in
comes under $10,000 "who are either
uninsured, not eligible for Medicaid or
hold inadequate insurance."
Catastrophic insurance would pro
vide protection against high doctor
and hospital costs stemming from a
serious illness that can financially
break a family with limited means.
Carter said that cost controls will
have to be a key part of any health
insurance plan, as will enforcement
against fraud and abuse. He added
there are "unwarranted costs of both
hospital and physician care" that need
to be brought under control.

Meanwhile, an HEW spokesman
confirmed that the proposal for a fed
eral agency to set ceilings on health
care costs is awaiting Carter's atten
tion. The spokesman said such an
agency would require all hospitals to
limit price hikes to those approved by
the agency.
Health care costs have been rising
considerably faster than the inflation
rate for the rest of the economy. The
increases havebeena majorelement in
the spiraling costs of Medicare and
Medicaid, which are expected to get
$40.3 billion in federal funds next
year.
