Committee delays Sprague decision
Washington — The House assassination commit
tee avoided a showdown yesterday over the power of
its chairman to fire Richard Sprague as chief counsel
and adjourned without resolving the issue.
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.), said after
ward he thought the committee and its mission to
investigate the slyyings of former President John
Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were
doomed unless the members followed his demand to
oust Sprague.
In a prepared statement, Gonzalez explained his
reasons for firing Sprague last week and said: "When
I see a rattlesnake on my doorstep, I don't hesitate. I
stomp on it and answer questions later."
The differences between Gonzalez and Sprague
became public last week when Gonzalez fired
Sprague for allegedly defying the chairman's orders
to cut the committee staff as a cost-saving measure.
The panel's other 11 members subsequently en
dorsed a letter reinstating Sprague the same day.
contending that only the committee, rather than
Gonzalez acting alone, had the power to dismiss the
attorney.
Sprague was unavailable for comment. He has
consistently declined to speak with reporters in re
cent days.
Pay raise for Congress imminent
Washington — A pay raise for members of Con
gress. federal judges and high federal officials
seemed certain yesterday to go into effect without a
House vote, after a move to put members on record
individually failed.
The attempt to bring the issue to the House floor
for a vote would have required unanimous consent.
It was blocked by Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Calif.).
Members objecting to the pay raise, or to the no
vote method of enacting it, or both, vowed to con
tinue their efforts to force a roll call. Some said they
would try to block weekend adjournment of the
House, scheduled for today.
But they acknowledged the odds against them

were long. House Republican Leader John Rhodes,
who sponsored the attempt to force a House vote,
told reporters: "1 am at a loss to know what else
anybody can do to get this to a vote."
Unless the House votes a disapproving resolution
by midnight Saturday, the pay raise — for represen
tatives and senators a $12,900 increase to $57,500 —
goes into effect automatically. The Senate, by a 56 to
42 vote Feb. 2. has already in effect refused to block
the raise. The Senate is in recess until Monday.
House revises Carter's rebate plan
Washington — The House Ways and Means
Committee voted yesterday to deny the proposed
$50-per-person tax rebates to high-income house
holds and to extend the bonus to welfare recipients.
The committee took the action before deciding
whether to strip the entire rebate plan from President
Jimmy Carter's program aimed at stimulating the
economy. It appears the panel will approve the re
bate plan, probably today.
On a 17 to 9 vote, the committee agreed to limit the
rebates to households with annual incomes under
$30,000. Those earning between $25,000 and
$30,000 would get less than $50 per person.
By 12 to 4, the panel voted to extend the $50-per
person rebates to the 11 million persons who receive
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the chief
welfare program. These families generally earn too
little to pay any income tax.
If the rebate idea is enacted along lines tentatively
approved by the committee, here is how it would
work:
. —An estimated 160 million persons would re
ceive rebates from 1976 taxes, up to $50 each. The
full $50 each would go only to families that earned
less than $25,000 last year. The 4.46 million house
holds with incomes above $30,000 would get no
rebate at all.
—About 28 million persons, most of whom now
qualify for a special tax break known as an earned
income credit, would get the $50 checks even
though they have no tax liability.
—Some 36 million persons who receive Social

Security, Supplemental Security Income or
railroad-retirement benefits would get a $50
"bonus" in lieu of a rebate.
Israel willing to begin peace talks
Jerusalem — Israel is willing to join Middle East
peace talks, but only without the Palestine Libera
tion Organization (PLO), Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said yesterday after with U.S. Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance
Vance told Israeli leaders on the first stop of a
middle Hast factfinding tour that the United States
wanted peace talks by the second half of 1977, but
would also keep refusing to deal with the PLO as
long as it would not recognize Israel's right to exist.
"The answer is simply no," Rabin said of pros
pects Israel would participate in talks that included a
PLO delegation.
Israeli officials who attended the meeting said Is
rael would stick by an earlier offer to let PLO mem
bers attend as part of a Jordanian organization. In a
slight elaboration on that offer, Rabin said yesterday
that Jordan's King Hussein should pick any Palesti
nian delegates.
Rabin said after meeting with Vance that he dis
puted a U.S. government view that Arab attitudes
toward Israel had moderated.

Israel willing to begin peace talks
Jerusalem — Israel is willing to join Middle East
peace talks, but only without the Palestine Libera
tion Organization (PLO), Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said yesterday after with U.S. Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance
Vance told Israeli leaders on the first stop of a
middle Hast factfinding tour that the United States
wanted peace talks by the second half of 1977, but
would also keep refusing to deal with the PLO as
long as it would not recognize Israel's right to exist.
"The answer is simply no," Rabin said of pros
pects Israel would participate in talks that included a
PLO delegation.
Israeli officials who attended the meeting said Is
rael would stick by an earlier offer to let PLO mem
bers attend as part of a Jordanian organization. In a
slight elaboration on that offer, Rabin said yesterday
that Jordan's King Hussein should pick any Palesti
nian delegates.
Rabin said after meeting with Vance that he dis
puted a U.S. government view that Arab attitudes
toward Israel had moderated.

Committee delays Sprague decision
Washington — The House assassination commit
tee avoided a showdown yesterday over the power of
its chairman to fire Richard Sprague as chief counsel
and adjourned without resolving the issue.
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.), said after
ward he thought the committee and its mission to
investigate the slyyings of former President John
Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were
doomed unless the members followed his demand to
oust Sprague.
In a prepared statement, Gonzalez explained his
reasons for firing Sprague last week and said: "When
I see a rattlesnake on my doorstep, I don't hesitate. I
stomp on it and answer questions later."
The differences between Gonzalez and Sprague

Sprague for allegedly defying the chairman's orders
to cut the committee staff as a cost-saving measure.

Pay raise for Congress imminent
Washington — A pay raise for members of Con
gress. federal judges and high federal officials
seemed certain yesterday to go into effect without a
House vote, after a move to put members on record
individually failed.
The attempt to bring the issue to the House floor
for a vote would have required unanimous consent.
It was blocked by Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Calif.).
Members objecting to the pay raise, or to the no
vote method of enacting it, or both, vowed to con
tinue their efforts to force a roll call. Some said they
would try to block weekend adjournment of the
House, scheduled for today.
But they acknowledged the odds against them

were long. House Republican Leader John Rhodes,
who sponsored the attempt to force a House vote,
told reporters: "1 am at a loss to know what else
anybody can do to get this to a vote."
Unless the House votes a disapproving resolution
by midnight Saturday, the pay raise — for represen
tatives and senators a $12,900 increase to $57,500 —
goes into effect automatically. The Senate, by a 56 to
42 vote Feb. 2. has already in effect refused to block
the raise. The Senate is in recess until Monday.
House revises Carter's rebate plan
Washington — The House Ways and Means
Committee voted yesterday to deny the proposed
$50-per-person tax rebates to high-income house
holds and to extend the bonus to welfare recipients.
The committee took the action before deciding
whether to strip the entire rebate plan from President
Jimmy Carter's program aimed at stimulating the
economy. It appears the panel will approve the re
bate plan, probably today.
On a 17 to 9 vote, the committee agreed to limit the
rebates to households with annual incomes under
$30,000. Those earning between $25,000 and
$30,000 would get less than $50 per person.
By 12 to 4, the panel voted to extend the $50-per
person rebates to the 11 million persons who receive
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the chief
welfare program. These families generally earn too
little to pay any income tax.
If the rebate idea is enacted along lines tentatively
approved by the committee, here is how it would
work:
. —An estimated 160 million persons would re
ceive rebates from 1976 taxes, up to $50 each. The
full $50 each would go only to families that earned

Pay raise for Congress imminent
Washington — A pay raise for members of Con
gress. federal judges and high federal officials
seemed certain yesterday to go into effect without a
House vote, after a move to put members on record
individually failed.
The attempt to bring the issue to the House floor
for a vote would have required unanimous consent.
It was blocked by Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Calif.).
Members objecting to the pay raise, or to the no
vote method of enacting it, or both, vowed to con
tinue their efforts to force a roll call. Some said they
would try to block weekend adjournment of the
House, scheduled for today.
But they acknowledged the odds against them

were long. House Republican Leader John Rhodes,
who sponsored the attempt to force a House vote,
told reporters: "1 am at a loss to know what else
anybody can do to get this to a vote."
Unless the House votes a disapproving resolution
by midnight Saturday, the pay raise — for represen
tatives and senators a $12,900 increase to $57,500 —
goes into effect automatically. The Senate, by a 56 to
42 vote Feb. 2. has already in effect refused to block
the raise. The Senate is in recess until Monday.
House revises Carter's rebate plan
Washington — The House Ways and Means
Committee voted yesterday to deny the proposed
$50-per-person tax rebates to high-income house
holds and to extend the bonus to welfare recipients.
The committee took the action before deciding
whether to strip the entire rebate plan from President
Jimmy Carter's program aimed at stimulating the
economy. It appears the panel will approve the re
bate plan, probably today.
On a 17 to 9 vote, the committee agreed to limit the
rebates to households with annual incomes under
$30,000. Those earning between $25,000 and
$30,000 would get less than $50 per person.
By 12 to 4, the panel voted to extend the $50-per
person rebates to the 11 million persons who receive
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the chief
welfare program. These families generally earn too
little to pay any income tax.
If the rebate idea is enacted along lines tentatively
approved by the committee, here is how it would
work:
. —An estimated 160 million persons would re
ceive rebates from 1976 taxes, up to $50 each. The
full $50 each would go only to families that earned
less than $25,000 last year. The 4.46 million house
holds with incomes above $30,000 would get no
rebate at all.
—About 28 million persons, most of whom now
qualify for a special tax break known as an earned
income credit, would get the $50 checks even
though they have no tax liability.
—Some 36 million persons who receive Social

Security, Supplemental Security Income or
railroad-retirement benefits would get a $50
"bonus" in lieu of a rebate.
Israel willing to begin peace talks
Jerusalem — Israel is willing to join Middle East
peace talks, but only without the Palestine Libera
tion Organization (PLO), Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said yesterday after with U.S. Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance
Vance told Israeli leaders on the first stop of a
middle Hast factfinding tour that the United States
wanted peace talks by the second half of 1977, but
would also keep refusing to deal with the PLO as
long as it would not recognize Israel's right to exist.
"The answer is simply no," Rabin said of pros
pects Israel would participate in talks that included a
PLO delegation.
Israeli officials who attended the meeting said Is
rael would stick by an earlier offer to let PLO mem
bers attend as part of a Jordanian organization. In a
slight elaboration on that offer, Rabin said yesterday
that Jordan's King Hussein should pick any Palesti
nian delegates.
Rabin said after meeting with Vance that he dis
puted a U.S. government view that Arab attitudes
toward Israel had moderated.

Committee delays Sprague decision
Washington — The House assassination commit
tee avoided a showdown yesterday over the power of
its chairman to fire Richard Sprague as chief counsel
and adjourned without resolving the issue.
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.), said after
ward he thought the committee and its mission to
investigate the slyyings of former President John
Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were
doomed unless the members followed his demand to
oust Sprague.
In a prepared statement, Gonzalez explained his
reasons for firing Sprague last week and said: "When
I see a rattlesnake on my doorstep, I don't hesitate. I
stomp on it and answer questions later."
The differences between Gonzalez and Sprague
became public last week when Gonzalez fired
Sprague for allegedly defying the chairman's orders
to cut the committee staff as a cost-saving measure.
The panel's other 11 members subsequently en
dorsed a letter reinstating Sprague the same day.

Gonzalez acting alone, had the power to dismiss the

Sprague was unavailable for comment. He has
