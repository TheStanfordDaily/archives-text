Correction
Yesterday's solar energy story inac
curately stated that Aeronautics and
Astronautics Department academic
secretary Cherry Bobier suggested that
the Mechanical Engineering Depart
ment might take over Prof. Howard
Seifert's course on solar energy.
Bobier only suggested the M.E. De
partment as a source of information on
solar energy courses. Neither depart
ment has set its curriculum for next
year.
