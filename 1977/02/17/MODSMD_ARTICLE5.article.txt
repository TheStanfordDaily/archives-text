# Dorm trial confirms conservation works
## 
### Ted Hamilton 
Energy conservation can work at the
University, and Lagunita Court is pro
ving it.
In a trial test before the initiation of
the official pilot conservation program
tomorrow, Lagunita cut its electricity
use by about 28 per cent, according to
Sam Coffey and Karl Johnson of the
Energy Office, and Lagunita Resident
Fellow Rob Robinson.
"Lagunita is setting the pace in the
energy conservation race," said Cof
fey, echoing the line on the conserva
tion posters tacked up throughout the
dorms.
In the 10 days since the electrical
meters have been monitored, Lagunita
showed an average daily use of ap
proximately 1075 kilowatthours,
compared to a daily reading of 1489
kilowatthours for the same period last
year, Robinson said.
Johnson explained that this was ac
complished primarily by replacing
100-watt bulbs with 60-watt bulbs, and

by turning off lights when rooms were
not in use.
Coffey, Johnson and Robinson all
stressed the importance of individual
students' concern.
'Deeper purpose'
"The students are doing it for a
deeper purpose than to save money.
They're doing it to avoid waste and
save energy," Coffey said.
Coffey said he felt the major problem
was a lack of awareness among the
students.
"Once they were made aware of the
problem, none said, 'The hell with
you, I want to keep on wasting,' " he
said.
Once tne pilot program gets under
way, all the lights in Lagunita will be
changed, the students will be asked to
voluntarily reduce the wattage of the
lighting in their rooms, and they will
be kept informed of the dorms' prog
ress through house meetings and
posted plot charts, Johnson said.
But more important, Lagunita stu
dents will be asked not to use their
electrical appliances, including
washers and dryers, between 4:30 p.m.
and 8:30 p.m., the peak demand hours
when electricity charges are much
ligher than during nonpeak hours,
ohnson added.
'Little things'
"Little things add up quickly in an
aggregate situation like this," Johnson
said.
Because of cost limitations, only
student rooms in Cranada House will
be supplied with dimmer switches iri a
further attempt to cut electrical use,
Robinson said.
Coffey and Johnson said they are
going to monitor Lagunita's daily elec
trical use through March, hoping that
by then, the students will save electric
ity on their own.
"We hope the conservation sustains
itself," Johnson said.
Johnson said Lagunita's surprising
effort so far demonstrates the potential
for student control of energy usage and
conservation.
"We hope this effort will arouse
other living groups," said Coffey.
