ASSU Sen. Jon Barth's "Come In My Parlor" proposal,
passed by the senate on Feb. 7, set up a committee to
investigate the possibilities of having a campus massage
parlor.
However, a variety of massage-related activities al
ready exist on campus.
The Bridge offers a free workshop on massage, taught
by various people in the community. The workshop en
rollment is limited to about 12 students, according to a
Bridge spokeswoman. The workshops are offered about
once a month, she said, depending on enrollment, and
meet weekly for several hours.
Terra House resident Larry Get/off said house funds
were going to be used to send several interested Terra
residents to a massage workshop at The Massage Center
in Palo Alto. Getzoff said there were "no plans to open to
other people"; the workshop graduates will keep their
skills within the house.
The financial manager at Hammarskjold House said
there was some massage going on in the house on a
"private basis." Some house members, he added, were
"thinking about doing it (massage) commercially to
bring in money for the house."
'Cloud nine'
Barth was invited to dinner and a massage at Ham
marskjold last week, according to the spokesman. Barth
and the two friends he brought along left "on cloud
nine," the spokesman added.
On the question of "sex and massage," the spokesman
said "there might be. but we keep it under the table."
If Barth's investigative committee produces an op
timistic report on massage parlor prospects, one of the
first steps toward making the parlor a reality would be
obtaining a permit from the county board of supervisors.
The sheriff, fire marshal and County Planning [De
partment check the building and zoning area and report
to the board. If the board approves the application, a
license is obtained from the tax collector.
The Santa Clara County Health Department "did not
know of any health requirements" for establishing a

parlor, according to a spokesman.
Good response
Barth and the three students on his committee have
begun talking to Palo Alto massage parlor owners and
the University administration about work/study for the
student masseurs and masseuses and legal aspects of the
proposal, said Barth. The response from local owners
was optimistic and the University's reaction was "not
automatically no." added Barth.
He said he thought about half the senators understood
his project intentions and about half did not. There are a
lot of roadblocks, said Barth, but the project is a good test
to see how far students can get in obtaining services
primarily for students.
According to other members, the senate was divided
on the "Come In My Parlor" proposal. The vote was
seven to five with five abstentions. The number of
abstentions seemed to indicate uncertainty about
whether Barth's proposal was submitted seriously, said a
senate member.
Seriousness questioned
University administrators questioned about the seri
ousness of the proposal and whether it will go beyond
the committee.
Dan YVilliams, associate dean of student affairs, said he
"would have to reserve official judgment until the com
mittee brings me the results of the study." He said his
understanding is that the committee is looking into the
"pros and cons" so he couldn't comment until he sees
the results.
James Siena, University legal adviser, said that if the
committee presents a realistic study showing "genuine
interest," the University would do "some real legal re
search" into the legality of the parlor.
"When somebody lays a concrete proposal before us,
we will rub it down," said Siena.
Barth said his committee will continue to look into
parlor possibilities, but added that he won't present the
results to the senate and University until he has the
results together in a "cohesive basis."
The possibilities for making t he massage parlor a real
ity remain in the hands of the investigative committee.

Legal problems?
A Palo Alto police officer and bystanders watch as the furnishings of
one of Palo Alto's massage parlors are loaded into a moving van
following a dawn raid in early December. The legal implications of an
on-campus massage parlor will be one of the issues considered by an
ASSU Senate committee appointed to explore the possibility of such a
facility.
