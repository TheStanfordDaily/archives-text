Theodore C. Sorensen, Jan. 17
The Senate's recent "success" in
forcing Theodore Sorensen to with
draw his nomination as director of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
raises some serious doubts regarding
the integrity of the Senate and some
puzzling questions about exactly
who's running Washington.
The allegations against Sorensen
had no substantial backing while his
qualifications and past record were, to
say the least, quite impressive. Furth
ermore, Sorensen offered the Senate
the same reform that many senators
have been so piously preaching about
since Watergate: he proposed to bring
in the "clean broom" that the CIA de
sperately needs.
Evidence reveals that the Senate's
reasons for pressuring Sorensen's
withdrawal were merely fabricated
because certain senators and intelli
gence men simply didn't want a liberal
reformer as head of the CIA. The actual
motivations and intentions of the
senatorial action to suppress Sorensen
were far from noble and were hidden
from the public.
One major accusation was that
Sorensen had used classified docu
ments from the White House in writing
his book Kennedy. However, both
President Eisenhower and President
Johnson did the same thing when writ
ing their memoirs, and even President
Ford recently acknowledged using
such "top secret" material in writing a
book on the Warren Commission.
Furthermore, Sorensen's critical
discretion in his history of the Ken
nedy Administration is beyond re
proach — the work has received no
thing but praise for 12 years and
Sorensen has been heralded by other
historians like Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
for using classified material "with the
utmost circumspection."
Many senators felt that he might leak
information as CIA head; his record
during the Cuban Missile Crisis proves
the contrary — Sorensen was known
all over Washington as an aloof, sensi
ble and "closed mouth" counsel to the
president.
Sorensen was also accuspd of being
a pacifist and moralist (two "faults"
the CIA could well afford to accom
modate.) Sorensen, as a conscientious
objector, had requested non
combatant status when registering for
the draft in 1946 and avoided service
in the Korean war. Sorensen argued,
however, that his personal non-violent
preferences did not alter his advice to
Kennedy and that as CIA director he
would accept the responsibility for
carrying out "every lawful order of the
president."
Sorensen's record as chief counsel to
Kennedy and his qualifications as a
perceptive historian, lawyer and polit
ical advisor must be given a high mark.
As a speech writer he was not only the
words but in many respects the
thoughts and inspiration behind the

New Frontier and "days of Camelot."
Along with Bobby Kennedy he
served as the conscience of the presi
dent during such times of stress as the
Bay of Pigs fiasco and Russian installa
tion of nuclear arms in Cuba. He is
regarded by friends and critics alike as
a brilliant intellectual with an over
riding compassion for people.
Then why was Sorensen treated so
harshly by the Senate? The answer is
three fold: first, Sorensen's nomina
tion aroused the old hawk/dove,
conservative/liberal debate in the Se
nate with the hardliners taking the
dominant position. Sorensen has been
known for his liberal, peace oriented
outlook, and immediately upon his
nomination the AFL-CIO and Senator
Henry Jackson launched an attack on
Sorensen for being too dovish. Senate
Intelligence Committee member Barry
Coldwater refused to speak with
Sorensen, yet he quite readily voiced
opposition against the nomination
without even listening to Sorensen's
case.
Secondly, Sorensen presented
views that the Senate and intelligence
community could not accept. In 1961,
Sorensen had criticized CIA officials
for the misleading evidence they had
given the White House regarding the
invasion of Cuba. Last month he
suggested that the CIA should be li
mited in its foreign policy activities,
that he was in favor of a foreign policy
which limited the risks of war, prefer
red the risk of peace, and avoided
covert activities. Sorensen further
explained that as head of intelligence
he would inform the president on
major CIA policy activities and await
approval by the Senate Intelligence
Committee in all possible instances.
The ironic point is that for more than a
decade senators complained about the
undeclared war in Vietnam and about
the covert activities that they "knew
nothing about." But the attitude of the
Senate Select Committee members to
ward Sorensen reveals that they do not
want to accept the responsibility that
goes along with approving CIA ac
tions. They would rather remain ig
norant while their constituents are
misled, thinking that the Senate repre
sents the nation's moral fibre.
Thirdly, several major groups excer
cised enough power in Washington to
overthrow the Sorensen nomination.
No hard evidence has yet to be unco
vered. but many persons speculate that
some individuals in the intelligence
community sabotaged Sorensen's po
tential. The CIA had a vested interest
in avoiding a reform-minded appoin
tee. A recently retired Defense Intelli
gence Agency man. Gen. Daniel
Graham, was reportedly seen voicing
injurious arguments to key legislators
in the Senate corridors. Senator Birch
Bayh (D-Ind.) expressed the belief that
some people were "out to get" Soren
sen because of his reform plans.
Sorensen is gone and President Car
ter has just chosen Admiral Stansfield
Turner as the next nominee for direc
tor of the CIA. Turner is presently
commander of the Allied Forces in
Southern Europe and an expert in
weapons system analysis and strategic

deterrence.
Even though the Senate knows little
about Turner's views on covert ac
tivities and foreign affairs, it seems
that this military choice has pleased
many conservative senators and that
Turner will not face any of the opposi
tion that Sorensen did. As far as bring
ing back morality to our national in
stitutions, only time can bear out this
new appointee's intentions and
capabilities.
It is clear, however, that the with
drawal of Sorensen was a tragic disap
pointment for those who hoped for re
form in the intelligence community
and a shameful setback in the career of
an intelligent and worthy man.
Moreover, in the final analysis, Soren
sen was right — he didn't lose; the
nation did.

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
raises some serious doubts regarding
the integrity of the Senate and some
puzzling questions about exactly
who's running Washington.
The allegations against Sorensen
had no substantial backing while his
qualifications and past record were, to
say the least, quite impressive. Furth
ermore, Sorensen offered the Senate
the same reform that many senators
have been so piously preaching about
since Watergate: he proposed to bring
in the "clean broom" that the CIA de
sperately needs.
Evidence reveals that the Senate's
reasons for pressuring Sorensen's
withdrawal were merely fabricated
because certain senators and intelli
gence men simply didn't want a liberal
reformer as head of the CIA. The actual
motivations and intentions of the
senatorial action to suppress Sorensen
were far from noble and were hidden
from the public.
One major accusation was that
Sorensen had used classified docu
ments from the White House in writing
his book Kennedy. However, both
President Eisenhower and President
Johnson did the same thing when writ
ing their memoirs, and even President
Ford recently acknowledged using
such "top secret" material in writing a
book on the Warren Commission.
Furthermore, Sorensen's critical
discretion in his history of the Ken
nedy Administration is beyond re
proach — the work has received no
thing but praise for 12 years and
Sorensen has been heralded by other
historians like Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
for using classified material "with the
utmost circumspection."
Many senators felt that he might leak
information as CIA head; his record
during the Cuban Missile Crisis proves
the contrary — Sorensen was known
all over Washington as an aloof, sensi
ble and "closed mouth" counsel to the
president.
Sorensen was also accuspd of being
a pacifist and moralist (two "faults"
the CIA could well afford to accom
modate.) Sorensen, as a conscientious
objector, had requested non
combatant status when registering for
the draft in 1946 and avoided service
in the Korean war. Sorensen argued,
however, that his personal non-violent
preferences did not alter his advice to
Kennedy and that as CIA director he
would accept the responsibility for
carrying out "every lawful order of the
president."
Sorensen's record as chief counsel to
Kennedy and his qualifications as a
perceptive historian, lawyer and polit
ical advisor must be given a high mark.
As a speech writer he was not only the
words but in many respects the
thoughts and inspiration behind the

New Frontier and "days of Camelot."
Along with Bobby Kennedy he
served as the conscience of the presi
dent during such times of stress as the
Bay of Pigs fiasco and Russian installa
tion of nuclear arms in Cuba. He is
regarded by friends and critics alike as
a brilliant intellectual with an over
riding compassion for people.
Then why was Sorensen treated so
harshly by the Senate? The answer is
three fold: first, Sorensen's nomina
tion aroused the old hawk/dove,
conservative/liberal debate in the Se
nate with the hardliners taking the
dominant position. Sorensen has been
known for his liberal, peace oriented
outlook, and immediately upon his
nomination the AFL-CIO and Senator
Henry Jackson launched an attack on
Sorensen for being too dovish. Senate
Intelligence Committee member Barry
Coldwater refused to speak with
Sorensen, yet he quite readily voiced
opposition against the nomination
without even listening to Sorensen's
case.
Secondly, Sorensen presented
views that the Senate and intelligence
community could not accept. In 1961,
Sorensen had criticized CIA officials
for the misleading evidence they had
given the White House regarding the
invasion of Cuba. Last month he
suggested that the CIA should be li
mited in its foreign policy activities,
that he was in favor of a foreign policy
which limited the risks of war, prefer
red the risk of peace, and avoided
covert activities. Sorensen further
explained that as head of intelligence
he would inform the president on
major CIA policy activities and await
approval by the Senate Intelligence
Committee in all possible instances.
The ironic point is that for more than a
decade senators complained about the
undeclared war in Vietnam and about
the covert activities that they "knew
nothing about." But the attitude of the
Senate Select Committee members to
ward Sorensen reveals that they do not
want to accept the responsibility that
goes along with approving CIA ac
tions. They would rather remain ig
norant while their constituents are
misled, thinking that the Senate repre
sents the nation's moral fibre.
Thirdly, several major groups excer
cised enough power in Washington to
overthrow the Sorensen nomination.
No hard evidence has yet to be unco
vered. but many persons speculate that
some individuals in the intelligence
community sabotaged Sorensen's po
tential. The CIA had a vested interest
in avoiding a reform-minded appoin
tee. A recently retired Defense Intelli
gence Agency man. Gen. Daniel
Graham, was reportedly seen voicing
injurious arguments to key legislators
in the Senate corridors. Senator Birch
Bayh (D-Ind.) expressed the belief that
some people were "out to get" Soren
sen because of his reform plans.
Sorensen is gone and President Car
ter has just chosen Admiral Stansfield
Turner as the next nominee for direc
tor of the CIA. Turner is presently
commander of the Allied Forces in
Southern Europe and an expert in
weapons system analysis and strategic

deterrence.
Even though the Senate knows little
about Turner's views on covert ac
tivities and foreign affairs, it seems
that this military choice has pleased
many conservative senators and that
Turner will not face any of the opposi
tion that Sorensen did. As far as bring
ing back morality to our national in
stitutions, only time can bear out this
new appointee's intentions and
capabilities.
It is clear, however, that the with
drawal of Sorensen was a tragic disap
pointment for those who hoped for re
form in the intelligence community
and a shameful setback in the career of
an intelligent and worthy man.
Moreover, in the final analysis, Soren
sen was right — he didn't lose; the
nation did.

ermore, Sorensen offered the Senate
the same reform that many senators
have been so piously preaching about
since Watergate: he proposed to bring
in the "clean broom" that the CIA de
sperately needs.
Evidence reveals that the Senate's
reasons for pressuring Sorensen's
withdrawal were merely fabricated
because certain senators and intelli
gence men simply didn't want a liberal
reformer as head of the CIA. The actual
motivations and intentions of the
senatorial action to suppress Sorensen
were far from noble and were hidden
from the public.
One major accusation was that
Sorensen had used classified docu
ments from the White House in writing
his book Kennedy. However, both
President Eisenhower and President
Johnson did the same thing when writ
ing their memoirs, and even President
Ford recently acknowledged using
such "top secret" material in writing a
book on the Warren Commission.
Furthermore, Sorensen's critical
discretion in his history of the Ken
nedy Administration is beyond re
proach — the work has received no
thing but praise for 12 years and
Sorensen has been heralded by other
historians like Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
for using classified material "with the
utmost circumspection."
Many senators felt that he might leak
information as CIA head; his record
during the Cuban Missile Crisis proves
the contrary — Sorensen was known
all over Washington as an aloof, sensi
ble and "closed mouth" counsel to the
president.
Sorensen was also accuspd of being
a pacifist and moralist (two "faults"
the CIA could well afford to accom
modate.) Sorensen, as a conscientious
objector, had requested non
combatant status when registering for
the draft in 1946 and avoided service
in the Korean war. Sorensen argued,
however, that his personal non-violent
preferences did not alter his advice to
Kennedy and that as CIA director he
would accept the responsibility for
carrying out "every lawful order of the
president."
Sorensen's record as chief counsel to
Kennedy and his qualifications as a
perceptive historian, lawyer and polit
ical advisor must be given a high mark.
As a speech writer he was not only the
words but in many respects the
thoughts and inspiration behind the

New Frontier and "days of Camelot."
Along with Bobby Kennedy he
served as the conscience of the presi
dent during such times of stress as the
Bay of Pigs fiasco and Russian installa
tion of nuclear arms in Cuba. He is
regarded by friends and critics alike as
a brilliant intellectual with an over
riding compassion for people.
Then why was Sorensen treated so
harshly by the Senate? The answer is
three fold: first, Sorensen's nomina
tion aroused the old hawk/dove,
conservative/liberal debate in the Se
nate with the hardliners taking the
dominant position. Sorensen has been
known for his liberal, peace oriented
outlook, and immediately upon his
nomination the AFL-CIO and Senator
Henry Jackson launched an attack on
Sorensen for being too dovish. Senate
Intelligence Committee member Barry
Coldwater refused to speak with
Sorensen, yet he quite readily voiced
opposition against the nomination
without even listening to Sorensen's
case.
Secondly, Sorensen presented
views that the Senate and intelligence
community could not accept. In 1961,
Sorensen had criticized CIA officials
for the misleading evidence they had
given the White House regarding the
invasion of Cuba. Last month he
suggested that the CIA should be li
mited in its foreign policy activities,
that he was in favor of a foreign policy
which limited the risks of war, prefer
red the risk of peace, and avoided
covert activities. Sorensen further
explained that as head of intelligence
he would inform the president on
major CIA policy activities and await
approval by the Senate Intelligence
Committee in all possible instances.
The ironic point is that for more than a
decade senators complained about the
undeclared war in Vietnam and about
the covert activities that they "knew
nothing about." But the attitude of the
Senate Select Committee members to
ward Sorensen reveals that they do not
want to accept the responsibility that
goes along with approving CIA ac
tions. They would rather remain ig
norant while their constituents are
misled, thinking that the Senate repre
sents the nation's moral fibre.
Thirdly, several major groups excer
cised enough power in Washington to
overthrow the Sorensen nomination.
No hard evidence has yet to be unco
vered. but many persons speculate that
some individuals in the intelligence
community sabotaged Sorensen's po
tential. The CIA had a vested interest
in avoiding a reform-minded appoin
tee. A recently retired Defense Intelli
gence Agency man. Gen. Daniel
Graham, was reportedly seen voicing
injurious arguments to key legislators
in the Senate corridors. Senator Birch
Bayh (D-Ind.) expressed the belief that
some people were "out to get" Soren
sen because of his reform plans.
Sorensen is gone and President Car
ter has just chosen Admiral Stansfield
Turner as the next nominee for direc
tor of the CIA. Turner is presently
commander of the Allied Forces in
Southern Europe and an expert in
weapons system analysis and strategic

deterrence.
Even though the Senate knows little
about Turner's views on covert ac
tivities and foreign affairs, it seems
that this military choice has pleased
many conservative senators and that
Turner will not face any of the opposi
tion that Sorensen did. As far as bring
ing back morality to our national in
stitutions, only time can bear out this
new appointee's intentions and
capabilities.
It is clear, however, that the with
drawal of Sorensen was a tragic disap
pointment for those who hoped for re
form in the intelligence community
and a shameful setback in the career of
an intelligent and worthy man.
Moreover, in the final analysis, Soren
sen was right — he didn't lose; the
nation did.
