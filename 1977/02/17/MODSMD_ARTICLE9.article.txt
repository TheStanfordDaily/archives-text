# Teaching aid needed

A possible false impression left by
the Report of the Task Force on Tenure
and Teaching Quality is in need of cor
rection. The Center for Teaching and
Learning hereat Stanford is one of sev
eral regional centers established by the
Danforth Foundation to help improve
teaching and learning at the college
level. I* is not a teaching resources
center, nor is it primarily designed to
service Stanford, but rather a broad
range of Bay Area colleges and univer
sities.
The programs that the center has
sponsored in the last two years have
included: the first national conference
on "Teaching the History of Women"
in January 1975; a two-week program
of workshops on teaching mathema
tics and history in July 1975; a one-day
conference on "Educating Women for
Science" at Mills College in April.
1976; a two-week program of work
shops on teaching religious studies
and Myth, Folklore and Ritual in july,
1976; and a series of activities
throughout last year and this designed
to help University teaching assistants
improve their pedagogicial skills.
Despite these many fine activities,
the center, as noted above, is not a
teaching resource center in the sense
of being equipped to assist individual
professors (or teaching assistants) with
specific teaching problems.
In fact, there is no resource center
here where faculty can seek help in
improving their ski I Is as lecturers, dis
cussion leaders or examiners.
If we are serious about giving sub-

stantial weight to teaching in the ap
pointments and promotions process,
and instituting a program of com
prehensive course evaluation for
diagnostic as well as formal evaluation
purposes, then clearly there must be
mechanisms to aid those teachers
whose diagnoses suggest the need for
improvements of some sort.
Such mechanisms ought to encom
pass a variety of alternatives to fit the
ind'vidual needs and style of the fa
culty member, including informal
work with peers, team teaching, and
consultations with deans or depart
ment heads. Some faculty may feel
more comfortable seeking help outside
their department, however, and here
the need for some kind of teaching re
sources center becomes apparent.
There ought to be some place where
Stanford teachers — graduate students
and professors — can receive profes
sional help in improving their teach
ing skills.
Given how little formal training in
pedagogy graduate students have trad
itionally received, such post-doctoral
assistance should be viewed as a
natural and logical supplement to the
professional training of many college
professors, and teaching assistant
workshops such as those organized by
the center should be welcomed by pre
sent graduate students and encour
aged on the departmental level.
