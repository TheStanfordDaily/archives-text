No other running shoe in the
world has made an impression
like this one.
They can't. The Nike waffle sole design is
registered with the U.S. government under
patent number 3793750.
It was designed by U.S. Olympic coach Bill
Bowerman. The idea popped up at his
breakfast table. The waffle sole was born!
It gives you the traction of a spike with the
cushion of a flat. A flared outer sole. A be
veled heel. The ultimate in traction, cushion
and stability.
But only on Nike.
Prices start at under $25n0
