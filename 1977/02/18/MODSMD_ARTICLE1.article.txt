# Broder: Carter a high risk
## 
### Michael Molyneux 
Jimmy Carter is likely to be a "high-risk pres
ident" both for himself and for the nation, jour
nalist David Broder, who covered Carter's rise
to the presidency, declared last night.
Broder, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist
and political reporter for the Washington Post
evaluated the month-old administration in a
talk before more than 200 persons in the Meyer
Forum Room.
Carter, he said, "will clearly challenge a lot of
established powers," including congressional
leaders, to bring about changes in energy pol
icy, budget and government organization.
Carter's most likely path for success, Broder
predicted, would be to forge a coalition of Re
publicans and southern Democrats.
By so doing, he continued, Carter would
"guarantee a challenge from the Democratic left
in 1980."
One problem encountered so far, Broder said,
has been with Carter's effort to establish a per
sonal relationship with leaders of Congress and
interest groups.
"This is likely to be seen as a characteristic
weakness of Carter's approach to the presi
dency," Broder said.

Carter is faced with a Congress, Broder said,
which has become accustomed to and perhaps
even enjoys, an adversarial role against the
executive branch.
As Carter appealed to the public in a fireside
chat, Broder said, "some Congressional leaders
may think they're going to end up in that firep
lace."
Broder considered Carter's public relations
work and his efforts to assemble a government
more successful aspects of the administration.
Tension appears present in foreign policy,
Broder said, between two aspects of Carter's
character: the "real politik" pitted against the
application of universal moral principles.
A more definite impression of Carter's
economic policy is evident, the journalist said,
calling Carter "essentially a successful small
businessman who believes the private sector
ought to be aided and abetted, instead of wres
tled with."
The talk, sponsored by SCOPE, was followed
by commentary by Herb Borock of the
Grapevine and former Daily columnist Bill Ev
ers.
If those two got together, Broder said, "Evers
and Borock could demolish Evans and Novak."
