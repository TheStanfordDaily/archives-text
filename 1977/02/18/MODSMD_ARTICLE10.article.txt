# Workaholics miss out
## 
### 
Did you wake up this morning with a bad case of the
Stanford Curse? When you went to bed last night (or earlier
this morning), did you have a nagging case of the "1 didn't
get all ot my work done" or the "What is my study-schedule
for tomorrow"? It you experienced any or all of these
symptoms and you find yourself to be chronically ex
periencing them, you may have a typical case of work
aholism.
The demand tor hard work and excellence at Stanford is
both its blessing and its curse. Some students cope well
with these demands, putting out high quality work without
becoming overwhelmed by the workload. Hut workaholism
is not an uncommon phenomenon here. Everyone knows a
few people whom they would classify as "workaholics."

These people seem to always he studying under panic
conditions and appear to use their studies as an avoidance
of participating in other aspects of life. It becomes tiresome
to be with such persons, and yet, the best cure (if you care
enough to try) is a little compassion.
Over commitment
If you know someone like this, ask your friend why he is
studying so hard. Is he having tremendous trouble under
standing the material in classes or is he overcommitted? If
overcommitment is the response, ask your friend why he
doesn't drop a class? It is not the worst thing in the world to
prove that you are human and h?ve a limit.
But the response may not be simple overcommitment. It
may be that your friend is chasing the eternal "better grade
to get into a better grad school." Often a common excuse for
workaholic behavior is, "After I get into
school, I'll be able to relax."
Unfortunately, those who feel this way do not see that
they are setting their style now for the rest of their lives. The
vicious circle may never end. In grad school, the compul
sivework will continueina strugglefora better clerkship or
residency; beyond that it becomes a chase for the dollar and

the name.
The disturbing thing about this constant chase is that it
could become so severe as to always detract from the rest of
the workaholic's life. As he gets older, and the dollar and
career become more overwhelming, what will become of
the more esoteric and aesthetic parts of life? Will he ever be
able to give them as much of himself as he has given his
career?
It is not particularly surprising that there are workaholics
at Stanford. Most of us come from backgrounds where tan
gible achievement is a valuable commodity in proving our
worth. Some of us may even come from backgrounds where
"what you are" is the total criterion for proving "who you
are."
But if one is always striving for that unreachable goal (a
position where everyone will know you, respect you, and
like you), will one ever be able to achieve one's own self
esteem?
There is, of course, a happy medium between work and
"play." Irresponsibility and laziness are not fulfilling
either. But there are things in life other than work; to always
be forcing to put 01 *i more work to meet a perceived set of
accepted standards cannot be very satisfying.
Take a walk
Instead of being chronically understudy pressure to the
point of exclusion of other satisfactions in life, try doing
something that isn't required (and which may not even look
good on your resume) for a change. Take a walk, talk to a
friend, listen to a friend, figure out what it is you want to do,
join a club or write a book.
There are many persons at Stanford who do work hard
and do achieve a lot and yet are not workaholics. These
people accept the responsibilities of hard work and
achievement as part of their own goals. For some reason,
they have looked at themselves and have seen something
good beneath all of their achievements.
These people are doing what they want to be doing, not
only because working hard and getting good grades will
make them look better to the other guy, hut because doing
well and working hard are important to them.
There is no question that hard and successful work is a
top priority here. We are surrounded by an atmosphere
which encourages and demands higher and more creative
learning. No doubt we can meet tin; challenges of tomorrow
because ot the demands we are willing to put on ourselves
today. Yet to permit ourselves to be overwhelmed by our
surroundings to theexclusion of understanding who weare
and what i\e are would be a terrible thing to do.

The disturbing thing about this constant chase is that it
could become so severe as to always detract from the rest of
the workaholic's life. As he gets older, and the dollar and
career become more overwhelming, what will become of
the more esoteric and aesthetic parts of life? Will he ever be
able to give them as much of himself as he has given his
career?
It is not particularly surprising that there are workaholics
at Stanford. Most of us come from backgrounds where tan
gible achievement is a valuable commodity in proving our
worth. Some of us may even come from backgrounds where
"what you are" is the total criterion for proving "who you
are."
But if one is always striving for that unreachable goal (a
position where everyone will know you, respect you, and
like you), will one ever be able to achieve one's own self
esteem?
There is, of course, a happy medium between work and
"play." Irresponsibility and laziness are not fulfilling
either. But there are things in life other than work; to always
be forcing to put 01 *i more work to meet a perceived set of
accepted standards cannot be very satisfying.
Take a walk
Instead of being chronically understudy pressure to the
point of exclusion of other satisfactions in life, try doing
something that isn't required (and which may not even look
good on your resume) for a change. Take a walk, talk to a
friend, listen to a friend, figure out what it is you want to do,
join a club or write a book.
There are many persons at Stanford who do work hard
and do achieve a lot and yet are not workaholics. These
people accept the responsibilities of hard work and
achievement as part of their own goals. For some reason,
they have looked at themselves and have seen something
good beneath all of their achievements.
These people are doing what they want to be doing, not
only because working hard and getting good grades will
make them look better to the other guy, hut because doing
well and working hard are important to them.
There is no question that hard and successful work is a
top priority here. We are surrounded by an atmosphere
which encourages and demands higher and more creative
learning. No doubt we can meet tin; challenges of tomorrow
because ot the demands we are willing to put on ourselves
today. Yet to permit ourselves to be overwhelmed by our
surroundings to theexclusion of understanding who weare
and what i\e are would be a terrible thing to do.

Did you wake up this morning with a bad case of the
Stanford Curse? When you went to bed last night (or earlier
this morning), did you have a nagging case of the "1 didn't
get all ot my work done" or the "What is my study-schedule
for tomorrow"? It you experienced any or all of these
symptoms and you find yourself to be chronically ex
periencing them, you may have a typical case of work
aholism.
The demand tor hard work and excellence at Stanford is
both its blessing and its curse. Some students cope well
with these demands, putting out high quality work without
becoming overwhelmed by the workload. Hut workaholism
is not an uncommon phenomenon here. Everyone knows a
few people whom they would classify as "workaholics."

These people seem to always he studying under panic
conditions and appear to use their studies as an avoidance
of participating in other aspects of life. It becomes tiresome
to be with such persons, and yet, the best cure (if you care
enough to try) is a little compassion.
Over commitment
If you know someone like this, ask your friend why he is
studying so hard. Is he having tremendous trouble under
standing the material in classes or is he overcommitted? If
overcommitment is the response, ask your friend why he
doesn't drop a class? It is not the worst thing in the world to
prove that you are human and h?ve a limit.
But the response may not be simple overcommitment. It
may be that your friend is chasing the eternal "better grade
to get into a better grad school." Often a common excuse for
workaholic behavior is, "After I get into
school, I'll be able to relax."
Unfortunately, those who feel this way do not see that
they are setting their style now for the rest of their lives. The
vicious circle may never end. In grad school, the compul
sivework will continueina strugglefora better clerkship or
residency; beyond that it becomes a chase for the dollar and

the name.
The disturbing thing about this constant chase is that it
