Spirited community
Over past years, the Daily has takeii
a dim view of cooperative houses at
Stanford, at times drawing the most
odious scenarios — "long-haired
women in barefeet preparing dinner."
Unfortunately, Friday's article (Daily.
Feb. 11) follows well this inveterate
tradition; reporter Pan Demetrakakes
intimates that a typical co-op is filthy,
inhabited by a group of apathetic
people who spend their time giving
each other backrubs rather than keep
ing up the kitchen or the theme. Con
sequently. Demetrakakes implies,
other students are not interested in liv
ing in these houses.
While I cannot speak definitively for
the other co-ops at Stanford, I must
vehemently register my objections to
the statements attributed to Synergy
House. First, Demetrakakes alleges
that Synergy does not "fulfill its
theme" —a blatant falsehood exacer
bated by Demetrakakes' neglecting to
mention Synergy's theme.
It is not, as Demetrakakes would
have us believe, a wayward home "for
alternative life-style speakers" nor
"Project Synergy" (which occurred in
1971). Rather, as a simple perusal of
Stanford University Information reve
als. Synergy's theme is "alternative
lifestyles"; in addition to being a
co-op, the gardening, recycling, solar
water heating, composting, vegetarian
food and consensus house meetings
are but a few of the ways in which we
clearly are an alternative lifestvle to

the rest of Stanford.
Hut much more significant than any
of these concrete examples, at Synergy
there is a definite feeling of commun
ity — an element lacking in many resi
dences. And, lest the Daily's quotation
of one house member that "there's not
much support of alternative lifestyles"
be construed as applying to members
of this house, allow the quotation tobe
put in proper context: Korry was refer
ring to an apparent trend on the Stan
ford campus, not at Synergy where the
house members actively support the
theme of the house.
As always, the positive aspects of
co-op living are ignored or miscon
ceived by the Daily, while the lack of
food preparation and kitchen filth are
inevitably presented as salient features
of co-ops. At Synergy, not a single
meal has been missed. Moreover,
cleaning inspections have placed
Synergy above numerous other inde
pendent houses — including non-co
ops.
Demetrakakes may be correct in one
area: co-ops may not be as popular as
they once were. Hut this phenomenon
is not due to the factors which Demet
rakakes discusses; rather, I believe,
this sort of errant journalism has given
co-ops unwarranted negative public
ity. For those in doubt, I encourage
your visiting our house to see our
theme and spirit in action.

Western culture
One purpose of a university is to
promote clear thinking and perspec
tives. To this purpose, I answer Glenn
Jordan's view of western culture
(Daily. Feb. 8).
Jordan labels western culture with a
number of nasty terms: sexist, col
onialist, racist. He pulls no punches:
". . . such monsters as Hitler are not
really aberrations but are direct pro
ducts of western society."
This says nothing. Any major cul
ture in the world, past or present, has
produced such men. He quotes
Cesaire: . . without 'the very distin
guished, very humanistic, very Christ
ian bourgeois of the twentieth century
. . . being aware of it.he has a Hitler
inside him. . . " This contains two
faults: a humanist Christian is a con
tradiction; and any Christian who
knows his dogma knows that he has a
Hitler (sin) inside him.
The assertion is made that the chief
factor distinguishing western society
from most other societies is its quest
for profit. This is false. It is a wide
spread trait of mankind that men and
women work for self-gain. What dis
tinguishes western society is that it has
been so spectacularly successful in fil
ling the material needs of its citizens.
Western culture is, indeed, strange
and unique. No other system of gov
ernment. past or present, has con
tained within itself mechanisms for
changing itself.
It is intuitively obvious, regardless
of whatever faults the societv mav

have, that studying the society in
which one lives is of prime impor
tance. Next in importance comes study
of other societies and determination of
how they are better and how they are
worse than one's own. A far, far distant
third place goes to devoting university
class time and university study time to
questionable rhetoric on what is
wrong with society. To criticize one's
own society before studying others re
sults in gross distortion of perspective.

Serious atmosphere
As fellow medical students with
Marc Effron, we feel compelled to
comment on his column (Daily, Feb.
11) concerning anatomy classes.
There's a businesslike, if not serious,
tone of the students in the anatomy
classes here. It suggests a day-to-day
conern to develop an understanding of
the human body. It also suggests a sen
sitivity toward the unusual nature of
the activity that occurs in the class —
the dissection of once-living men and
women.
We were disappointed that the col
umn last week mainly reflected a mor
bid fascination and callous humor for
this experience.
Anatomical dissection can express
deference or disrespect towards the
human body; it's mainly a question of
attitude. Our attitude is one of defer
ence.
