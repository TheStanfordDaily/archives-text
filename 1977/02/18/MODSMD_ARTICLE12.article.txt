# Who runs Hoover Tower?
## The
						man at the summit 
### Kathy Trafton 
The director of the Hoover In
stitute on War. Revolution and
Peace chooses to work in a small
meeting room that is dominated
hy a large table. More often than
not his office with its parquet
floor, Persian rugs and floor-to
ceiling bookshelves lies unused.
W. Clenn Campbell labors
amongst a t lutter o! papers and
books, and a glorious view of the
red tilt? roofs of the Stanford
campus lies I I floors below. In
the center of tin 1 table sits an ar
chitect's model of the unfinished
I loover complex.
The present Hoover buildings
house one of the world's finest
Slavic collections as well as
strong collections of material on
Africa, bast Asia, the Middle
Hast and Western Kurope.
Within the largest private arc
hives in the country are such
i in porta nt holdings as Russian
secret polic e tiles from 1895-
1!)I7 and the diaries of (ierman
Na/.i Propaganda Chief Joseph
(loebbels.
Hard work
Campbell does not seek pub
licity lor himself, and the request
for an interview surprises him.
He runs his institution not so
much with style as with hard
work.
This is the man whom col
leagues say has almost entirely
changed the organization of the
Hoover Institution since be was
chosen personally by Herbert
Hoover to serve as director and
fund-raiser 1H years ago.
An economist by training, an
educational administrator hy
trade, and a political conserva
tive by choice. Campbell knew
how to raise money and bow to
garner support. He and Hoover
raised enough money the first
year to pull the Institution out of
the red.
Think tank planning
Campbell's colleague Ceorge
Marotta says "the growth of the
institution has been well
planned. Its recognition as an in
fluential west coast think tank
didn't happen overnight.A lot of
it is due to his planning.
Campbell's forte has been the
ability to attract the kind of re
search scholars we have now to
come here to do their work."
His first undertaking,
Campbell says, was to rebuild
the stall and the quality of the
collection in the international
field. More recent efforts have
centered on boosting the domes
tic collection as welI.
Campbell says his goal is for

the "development of the domes
tic studies program to become
equal with the quality of the in
ternational studies program. I
think we have made progress.
You can't grow everything over
night." He removes his glasses
and scratches his pale cheek
with them.
Perfectionist
Campbell is a demanding,
hard-working perfectionist, "lit 1
has high standards for his own
work and for that ol others He
has created .in environment
where he is able to motivate
people b\ leadership. He runs a
very lean organization lit' is
not padded by assistants .it the
top. You don't ilo this by being a
lackadaisical guy with no self
discipline," says Marotta.
The stocky 52 year old
Campbell sometimes calls him
self The farm Hoy. He was born
and raised on a small t.trm in On
tario. Canada where, as the
youngest of seven childien, lit;
helped work the farm horses a nd
thrashing machine. Lessons
were conducted in a one room
country school house.
At 16. he went to college at t he
University of West Onatrio in
London, and played the twelfth
Canadian football position cal
led "wingback."
Harvard man
Campbell went to Harvard at
20 where he received his I'll.I) in
economics, and did some teach
ing. "I enjoyed teaching and like
to think 1 was good at it. During
my last year at Harvard I got the
highest grading in the student
evaluation booklet."
"I know I will never go back to
teaching. I don't really miss it
anymore. What I miss is the in
teraction with the students," he
says.
"1 think many students have
more common sense than some
of my colleagues. They have a
more general outlook on the
world and its problems They
have quite open minds and often
are exceedingly well informed."
he says.
Conservative
Campbell shifts position?, in
his chair, and his blue shirt and
black watch plaid slacks appear
rumpled. His secretary says that
his clothes reflect his tendency
toward conservatism.
"I find my work fascinat
ing, "Campbell says. Tin; is for
tunate as his hobbies are work
also, lie is a Regent ol the Uni
versity ol California, and has
consistently voted conserva
tively for such policies as raising

student tuition, firing Angela
Davis and banning Eldridge
Clever from campus.
Campbell took a leave of ab
sent e from Stanford in 1964 to
serve as an adviser to Harry
Coldwater. the conservative re
publican president ial candidate.
Campbell says he doesn't think
being Republican is a terribly
unusual trait for a director of the
I loover Institute.
Campbell has served on the
President's Committee on Sci
ence and Technology, was an
economist for the II.S. Chamber
ol Commerce, was research di
ret tor of the American Enter
prise Association and has served
as the ( onsultant to the Defense
Department and the I I.S. Senate.
Man
As a member of the National
Science Hoard ol the National
Science foundation, he recently
journeyed to Antarctica on a site
visit His most enjoyable trips,
however, have been to his con
dominium on the island of Maui
in llau.iii. and he admits that he
is cutting down on outside ac
tivities.
Campbell putters around the
garden and plays tennis in his
"spare" time. "I don't want to
give you the impression that I do
a lot of work around the house,
because I don't." His wife. Rita
Ricardo Campbell, is serving on
the President's Commission on
the Status of Women.
Campbell's wife is one of 1U
Senior fellows at the Hoover In
stitute. Her field is health
economics, and she has lectured
at the Stanford Medical School.
Having the name Glenn
Campbell has caused some
mix-ups, Campbell says, locking
his hands behind his head as he
leans back. It has been about six
years since lit! has received a fan
letlei intended for the singer of
t he same name.
The real Glenn Campbell
Once while placing a call
through to former California
governor Ronald Reagan, the
operator inquired, "are you the
real Glenn Campbell?"
Campbell assured her that he
most certainly was. "Then I
asked her if she'd like me to sing
for her, and at that point she
caught on."
Campbell glances at the con
struction going on below on the
Herbert Hoover federal Memo
rial building. "When the new
building is completed, Stanford
will have t he finest facilities, not
to mention the people in the
program, on political, social and
economic change in the twen
tieth century ol any place in the
country."
