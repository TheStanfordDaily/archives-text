# Measles rate rising

Atlanta (AP) — Outbreaks of
measles, one of the most serious
of childhood diseases, are in
creasing at alarming rates in
some states, and public health
officials are calling for means to
curb their spread.
Although most states have
laws requiring immunization
against measles, an Associated
Press survey shows little is done
to enforce them.
Peter Crippen, head of India
na's immunization program,
said that state's law has
loopholes "so big you could
drive a bus through."
Last year 39,58.5 cases of
measles were reported nation
ally — the largest number since
1971, according to the national
Center for Disease Control
(CDC). The all-time low was
28,094 in 1974.
Many of the states responding
to the AP survey report large in
creases of measle cases last year
over 1975 and many said 1977
likely will be even worse.
Dr. Walter Orenstein, a medi
cal epidemiologist at the CDC,
said he believes most states
which have immunization laws
are not enforcing them.
Orenstein said the mortality
rate of the disease is about one in
1,300. In rare cases it can also
cause permanent brain damage.
Measles are most infectious
before diagnosis, he said, and by
then a child can infect an entire
classroom unless the children
have been vaccinated. Orenstein
said a child may have it 10 days
before it is diagnosed.
Public health officials attri
bute the increase to several
things.
"One is that many children
not vaccinated in the 1960s
would have gotten measles then
but there was so little virus

around they didn't," Orenstein
said.
"Now they are in an older age
group and they get around more.
They are among other children.
We are seeing the increase in the
10-plus age group."
In California, measles de
clined last year but a spokesman
said an increase may be on the
way this year.
Utah has a law which requires
children to be immunized — un
less their parents object and then
they don't have to.
Indiana reported 520 cases in
1975 and 4,400 in 1976. Crippen
said the outlook for 1977 "looks
bad, because we're already
above 1976 levels for this time of
year."
Indiana has an immunization
law but Crippen said, "That
doesn't mean every child enter
ing public school is immunized.
A parent could object to it."
He said he believes the law is
strong enough if it were en
forced.

"It's more a question of con
vincing parents of the worth and
necessity of immunization
without going after them with a
stick," he said.
Utah reported 373 cases in
1975 and 2,351 last year.
□onald Biemiller of Virginia's
epidemiology division said he
believes that state's immuniza
tion law should be enforced un
iformly.
Virginia reported 38 cases of
measles in 1975 and 844 last
year.
Pennsylvania, which saw
measles bounce from 626 in
1975 to 2,682 last year, has a law
providing for fines and impris
onment for failing to comply, but
state health officials say no one
has ever been penalized.
In Ohio, there were 1,000
cases last year, compared with
106 in 1975. Public health offi
cials say they fear a possible
epidemic. It was noted that more
than 100,000 children in Ohio
have not been vaccinated.
