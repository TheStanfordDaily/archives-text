# Lucero takes on touchy assignment
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Studying judicial precedents
is nothing new to Fred Lucero.
Setting them is.
I.ucero stepped into the
California history books last De
cember when he became the first
superior court judge of
Mexican-American descent in
Northern California.
Cov. Edmund Brown Jr. ap
pointed him to the superior
court bench in Santa Clara
County.
Lucero says he has mixed feel
ings about his distinction. If
you're looking for a "Tab, rail,
Chicano rights" type, he's not
your man. At the same time, he's
proud of his heritage and ac
complishments.
"There are two sides to it,"
Lucero said the other day in his
San )ose office. "One side is that
I'd like to be treated as any other
person either because 1 have the
qualifications or because 1 can
do the job. My ethnic
background is immaterial. That
Would be ideal. We don't live in
that kind of world, though.
People pay attention to those dif
ferences.
"The other side is that 1 am
proud to be the first when any
barrier, real or imagined, is bro
ken. It's a symbol for the rest of
the members of a group. It en
hances their self-image."
Touchy assignment
Lucero's new assignment is a
touchy one. Pending actual di
vorce proceedings, he decides
such matters as temporary cus
tody of children, amount of fi
nancial support to be paid and
use of the family home.
Lucero does not attempt to
minimize the bitterness inherent
in these hearings.

"I understand more judges get
killed on this assignment than
on any other," he said.
"1 used to handle some very
serious cases with some very
serious penalties in the ba
lance," added Lucero, a former
assistant public defender, "and
the emotions were never as raw
as at the proceedings here.
People come with their emotions
at the surface. You're dealing
with the nucleus of the family
and society, and it's being torn
apart.
"A judge who becomes emo
tionally involved would be emo
tionally drained at the end of the
day and wouldn't last very long
on the calendar. You have to be
em pathetic, but you also have to
take a clinical approach so you
can help."
Tough decisions
Lucero said his toughest deci
sions come when equally capa
ble parents both want custody of
their children. The judge said
that in these instances, he usu
ally leaves the children where
ver they are at the time.
There are other times when
Lucero's cases are fairly clear
cut. He recalled one easy verdict
involving a young man who
came to argue for custody of his
child.
"The guy came in with a hat
with leathers sticking out of it, a
guitar, a big stick and some kind
of bizarre clothing. When I
talked to him. he called me
'pops.' He was a little deranged,
psychotic. The bailiff had rein
forcements stand behind him to
make sure he didn't do anything.
"1 just let him go and indicated
that I wanted a little more re
spect. He said he wasn't respect

ful of any man and went into this
religious tiling."
Lucero gave the child to the
wife.
Lucero said that the proceed
ings occasionally have happy
endings.
Marriage salvaging
"Every once in a while, I see
something that can be salvaged
in the marriage and I'll try to
convince the couple to go to a
counselor. Usually, they resist.
I've only been successful once so
far.
"Once in a while. I'll get a case
where (the court administrator)
says, 'The parties have recon
ciled â€” take it off the calendar.'
That makes me happy."
If one were to choose the
necessary attributes of a good
judge, what would they be?
Wisdom? Diligence? Compas
sion? Patience? According to
Lucero's associates, those qual
ities seem to be as much a part of
Lucero as his arms and legs.
"He has a deep sensitivity for
people," said Sheldon Portman,
Santa Clara County public de
fender and Lucero's former boss.
"He was a very dedicated public
defender. He worked hard and
diligently for his clients and
never, despite a very heavy case
load, complained.
"I've never known him to lose
his temper. He always treated
people with courtesy and dig
nity."
Strange and nice
"He's a most unusual person,
in all honesty," said Dep. Dist.
Atty. Ulysses Beasley, who grew
up with Lucero in Richmond.
"He's strange because he's so
nice."
Lucero is originally from Al

buquerque, N.M., but moved
with his family in 1943 to
Richmond, where his lather
worked in the shipyards.
Lucero abandoned his first in
terest, industrial psychology,
because, he said, there were no
good schools in that field in the
West and he had no money to go
east,
"I thought law would oe a
good alternative," he said, "but I
didn't know if I could make it. I
took a law school admission test
and the results were encourag
ing, so 1 said, 'What the hell, I'll

go to law school.' "
Lucero graduated from Hast
ings College of Law in San Fran
cisco in 19H2. He entered private
law practice in 1963, but left two
years later.
"I wasn't making any money,"
Lucero explained. "It was no
problem getting clients. Getting
paying clients was a different
problem."
Lucero then worked in the
Santa Clara County Public De
fender's Office until ascending
to the superior court bench last
year.
