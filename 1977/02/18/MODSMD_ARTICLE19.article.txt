Where can dorms rent or borrow theatrical lights
for parties and dramas? I've heard of an organiza
tion called U.L.P.. hut I can't find them. Who and
where are they? -S.W.J.
"They" are the Undergraduate Lighting Project,
located in the basement of Wilbur Hall. According
to treasurer John Adams, a few years ago a group of
students realized that dorm productions were on
the rise and that equipment rentals were extremely
expensive. The group eventually squeezed a one
time grant of $9000 from the provost's office to
start a student-run rental service with incredibly
low fees.
For example, lights can be rented for around
$1.25 each, for whatever period of time they're
needed. And if you're throwing a party and want to
add a touch of disco, the U.L.P. has a 17-inch
diameter mirror ball for rent for $5. In bargain
hunting circles, that's what they call "a real steal,"
since a mirror ball usually rents for at least $20.
If you are interested in renting from them, the
U.L/P. holds a scheduling meeting at the begin
ning of every quarter. But if you've a'ready missed
that, don't be too despondent. Adams says they try
their best to fit every group in. On the door of the

U.L.P. is a list of all volunteers, including Chair
man Doug Bedard (producer of upcoming Fiddler
on the Hoof). Call any of them for help.
Before someone raises the question or someone
else climbs the fence and kicks another hole in
seemingly noble protest, would you please help us
puss the word that the big plastic bubble over the
swimming pool at the Pearce Mitchell faculty con
dominium is not covering a lot of water being
heated by thousands of cubic feet of natural gas?
The pool is cold. The heater has been off since
Feb. 2. The bubble is up to help keep the pool
clean, save on chemicals and reduce maintenance
needs. -D.C.
Okay, and for those interested, the P.S. on this
letter added the following: "The PUC order ban
ning the use of natural gas for such luxuries as
heating swimming pools probably wouldn't apply
to Pearce Mitchell because of the number of older
people who use the pool and jacuzzi for therapeu
tic reasons. The homeowners simply recognize the
seriousness of the natural gas emergency and are
doing what they can do to help."
