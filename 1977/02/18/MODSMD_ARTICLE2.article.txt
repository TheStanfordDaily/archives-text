# Med School programs may undergo cutbacks
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Student enrollment and post
graduate programs at the Medical
School are being threatened with pos
sible cutbacks due to an accreditation
crisis at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center (VMC).
VMC, like many county hospitals, is
currently an accredited teaching hos
pital. The Medical School here,
through its affiliation with VMC,
maintains residency and clerkship
programs there.
Multimillion dollar deficiencies in
the physical plant of VMC cited by the
Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Hospitals and the State Department of
Health this January have jeopardized
VMC's licensure and accreditation,
according to Dr. Yvonne Russell,
county director of medical institutions
and associate dean of the medical
school.
"The cost of correcting the physical
facility is so great that accreditation
and licensure is at stake," Russell
stated.
"From Stanford's point of view this
would be a disaster," Russell said. "If
we lose accreditation, we also lose ap
proval of the AMA (American Medical
Association) for all our clerkship, in
ternship and residency positions."
"Not only that, (but) the dean has
previously said that it would affect
medical class size as much as 20 stu
dents, if Valley were unable to be part
of a teaching program."
Clayton Rich, dean of the Medical
School, confirmed that if VMC lost its
accreditation, "we might reduce class
size". "Valuable" residencies, and
clerkships for junior and senior medi
cal students would also be lost, he
said.
"I don't think the type of problem
they're facing is that serious," Rich
emphasized. Loss of accreditation
could happen, though, he said.
The basic problem arises from an
"extreme deficiency of capitalization,"
Russell said. VMC has lacked money to
maintain and modernize its plant, she
said.
VMC's lack of capitalization funds is
symptomatic of a much larger prob
lem, however.
On Jan. 14, Russell attended a meet
ing with Cov. Edmund G. "Jerry"
Brown and representatives of deans of
seven other California medical schools
in an effort to alert the governor to
what UCLA Medical School Dean
Sherman Mellinkoff called "an acute
and immediate crisis in financing

county hospital services in Califor
nia."
The representatives hoped to enlist
the governor's support for legislation
now being formulated which would
provide immediate fiscal relief, while
a long term plan of state health care
reform was worked out, according to
Russell.
Deficiencies cited by the accredita
tion survey will cost anywhere from $5
to $10 million to correct, Russell said.
She said she is seeking an architect's
accurate estimate.
"We have recently had a seismic
study which showed that the seven
story building (a wing of the hospital)
is not seismically safe, and that the
cost is estimated at $15 million to
bring it up to standard," Russell said.
This was not cited by the survey.
In addition, VMC is expecting next
year's budget wil 1 not increase to cover
the cost of employes' salary raises and
the inflationary costs of supplies and
equipment, Russell said.
Because of the burden presented by
all these costs, the county is consider
ing construction of an entirely new
hospital facility, Russell said.
"We believe that the state and the
joint commission would find this ac
ceptable as our means of correcting the
deficiencies," after efforts are made to
correct the worst deficiencies in the
facility, said Russell.
"Anyone would agree, however,

that this is a particularly poor time to
approach the public in terms of a bond
issue or tax override. It is a very serious
question of how the county could fund
a replacement," Russell said.
Russell reported to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors on Tues
day, on the basis of a "preliminary ver
bal summary" by the accreditation
team. A final report is not due until
sometime before June, Russell said.
Despite Russell's warning that the
accreditation team would be back in 90
to 120 days to determine if "significant
progress" had been made, the super
visors deferred any action until the
March 3 meeting of the hospital con
ference committee.
The supervisors hope to speak to a
representative of the State Department
of Health at that meeting to ascertain
the exact status of the hospital, Russell
said.
The accreditation team found
laboratory overcrowding and de
ficiencies in fireproofing; air condi
tioning; space requirements in the in
tensive care, burn and neo-natal units;
storage space; and facilities in the
emergency room and clinics.
Stanford had 59 residencies at VMC
in 1975, according to the 1974-75
American Medical Association direc
tory of approved residencies. There are
also "quite a substantial number" of
clerkships involved, according to
Rich.

In addition, VMC is expecting next
year's budget wil 1 not increase to cover
the cost of employes' salary raises and
the inflationary costs of supplies and
equipment, Russell said.
Because of the burden presented by
all these costs, the county is consider
ing construction of an entirely new
hospital facility, Russell said.
"We believe that the state and the
joint commission would find this ac
ceptable as our means of correcting the
deficiencies," after efforts are made to
correct the worst deficiencies in the
facility, said Russell.
"Anyone would agree, however,

that this is a particularly poor time to
approach the public in terms of a bond
issue or tax override. It is a very serious
question of how the county could fund
a replacement," Russell said.
Russell reported to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors on Tues
day, on the basis of a "preliminary ver
bal summary" by the accreditation
team. A final report is not due until
sometime before June, Russell said.
Despite Russell's warning that the
accreditation team would be back in 90
to 120 days to determine if "significant
progress" had been made, the super
visors deferred any action until the
March 3 meeting of the hospital con
ference committee.
The supervisors hope to speak to a
representative of the State Department
of Health at that meeting to ascertain
the exact status of the hospital, Russell
said.
The accreditation team found
laboratory overcrowding and de
ficiencies in fireproofing; air condi
tioning; space requirements in the in
tensive care, burn and neo-natal units;
storage space; and facilities in the
emergency room and clinics.
Stanford had 59 residencies at VMC
in 1975, according to the 1974-75
American Medical Association direc
tory of approved residencies. There are
also "quite a substantial number" of
clerkships involved, according to
Rich.
Student enrollment and post
graduate programs at the Medical
School are being threatened with pos
sible cutbacks due to an accreditation
crisis at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center (VMC).
VMC, like many county hospitals, is
currently an accredited teaching hos
pital. The Medical School here,
through its affiliation with VMC,
maintains residency and clerkship
programs there.
Multimillion dollar deficiencies in
the physical plant of VMC cited by the
Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Hospitals and the State Department of
Health this January have jeopardized
VMC's licensure and accreditation,
according to Dr. Yvonne Russell,
county director of medical institutions
and associate dean of the medical
school.
"The cost of correcting the physical
facility is so great that accreditation
and licensure is at stake," Russell
stated.
"From Stanford's point of view this
would be a disaster," Russell said. "If
we lose accreditation, we also lose ap
proval of the AMA (American Medical
Association) for all our clerkship, in
ternship and residency positions."
"Not only that, (but) the dean has
previously said that it would affect
medical class size as much as 20 stu
dents, if Valley were unable to be part
of a teaching program."
Clayton Rich, dean of the Medical
School, confirmed that if VMC lost its
accreditation, "we might reduce class
size". "Valuable" residencies, and
clerkships for junior and senior medi
cal students would also be lost, he
said.
"I don't think the type of problem
they're facing is that serious," Rich
emphasized. Loss of accreditation
could happen, though, he said.
The basic problem arises from an
"extreme deficiency of capitalization,"
Russell said. VMC has lacked money to
maintain and modernize its plant, she
said.
VMC's lack of capitalization funds is
symptomatic of a much larger prob
lem, however.
On Jan. 14, Russell attended a meet
ing with Cov. Edmund G. "Jerry"
Brown and representatives of deans of
seven other California medical schools
in an effort to alert the governor to
what UCLA Medical School Dean
Sherman Mellinkoff called "an acute
and immediate crisis in financing

county hospital services in Califor
nia."
The representatives hoped to enlist
the governor's support for legislation
now being formulated which would
provide immediate fiscal relief, while
a long term plan of state health care
reform was worked out, according to
Russell.
Deficiencies cited by the accredita
tion survey will cost anywhere from $5
to $10 million to correct, Russell said.
She said she is seeking an architect's
accurate estimate.
"We have recently had a seismic
study which showed that the seven
story building (a wing of the hospital)
is not seismically safe, and that the
cost is estimated at $15 million to
bring it up to standard," Russell said.
This was not cited by the survey.
In addition, VMC is expecting next

ternship and residency positions."
"Not only that, (but) the dean has
previously said that it would affect
medical class size as much as 20 stu
dents, if Valley were unable to be part
of a teaching program."
Clayton Rich, dean of the Medical
School, confirmed that if VMC lost its
accreditation, "we might reduce class
size". "Valuable" residencies, and
clerkships for junior and senior medi
cal students would also be lost, he
said.
"I don't think the type of problem
they're facing is that serious," Rich
emphasized. Loss of accreditation
could happen, though, he said.
The basic problem arises from an
"extreme deficiency of capitalization,"
Russell said. VMC has lacked money to
maintain and modernize its plant, she
said.
VMC's lack of capitalization funds is
symptomatic of a much larger prob
lem, however.
On Jan. 14, Russell attended a meet
ing with Cov. Edmund G. "Jerry"
Brown and representatives of deans of
seven other California medical schools
in an effort to alert the governor to
what UCLA Medical School Dean
Sherman Mellinkoff called "an acute
and immediate crisis in financing

county hospital services in Califor
nia."
The representatives hoped to enlist
the governor's support for legislation
now being formulated which would
provide immediate fiscal relief, while
a long term plan of state health care
reform was worked out, according to
Russell.
Deficiencies cited by the accredita
tion survey will cost anywhere from $5
to $10 million to correct, Russell said.
She said she is seeking an architect's
accurate estimate.
"We have recently had a seismic
study which showed that the seven
story building (a wing of the hospital)
is not seismically safe, and that the
cost is estimated at $15 million to
bring it up to standard," Russell said.
This was not cited by the survey.
In addition, VMC is expecting next
year's budget wil 1 not increase to cover
the cost of employes' salary raises and
the inflationary costs of supplies and
equipment, Russell said.
Because of the burden presented by
all these costs, the county is consider
ing construction of an entirely new
hospital facility, Russell said.
"We believe that the state and the
joint commission would find this ac
ceptable as our means of correcting the
deficiencies," after efforts are made to
correct the worst deficiencies in the
facility, said Russell.
"Anyone would agree, however,

that this is a particularly poor time to
approach the public in terms of a bond
issue or tax override. It is a very serious
question of how the county could fund
a replacement," Russell said.
Russell reported to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors on Tues
day, on the basis of a "preliminary ver
bal summary" by the accreditation
team. A final report is not due until
sometime before June, Russell said.
Despite Russell's warning that the
accreditation team would be back in 90
to 120 days to determine if "significant
progress" had been made, the super
visors deferred any action until the
March 3 meeting of the hospital con
ference committee.
The supervisors hope to speak to a
representative of the State Department
of Health at that meeting to ascertain
the exact status of the hospital, Russell
said.
The accreditation team found
laboratory overcrowding and de
ficiencies in fireproofing; air condi
tioning; space requirements in the in
tensive care, burn and neo-natal units;
storage space; and facilities in the
emergency room and clinics.
Stanford had 59 residencies at VMC
in 1975, according to the 1974-75
American Medical Association direc
tory of approved residencies. There are
also "quite a substantial number" of
clerkships involved, according to
Rich.
