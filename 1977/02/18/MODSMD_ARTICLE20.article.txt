Holocaust dispute
Evanston, 111., Jan. 28 — The
controversy rages on at the
Northwestern University cam
pus about an electrical engi neer
ing professor's book which con
tends that the Nazis' extermina
tion of the Jews did not actually
occur. Assoc. Prof. Arthur R.
Butz believes that the Nazis have
been maligned by an interna
tional Zionist conspiracy.
The repercussions of Butz'
book are evident in the Daily
Northwestern. Full page ads de-

ploring the contentions and an
nouncing the inception of legal
proceedings against the author
ar<; sprinkled through the news
paper. The alumni association
voiced its fears that the publicity
would decrease alumni support.
The university relations office
received 200 to 300 calls in a
two-day period from angry
alumni. Some of them feared
that the book would rekindle
North western's anti-Semitic
reputation from the 1940s and
19505, when the school was rai
led the "North Shore Country
Club." according to University
Relations Director Jack O'Dowd.
One alumnus condemned the
university president and the
administration for their "dreary,
dismal, deplorable, disgusting
and dangerous inability to cope
with 'l'affaire Butz'." As an
alumna of Northwestern she
went on to say, "1 am horrified
and humiliated to .see the swas
tika waving arrogant and Aryan
over Evanston."
The main complaint against
the university is that it waited
almost two weeks to speak out
on the subject, and even then al
legedly only issued an "emascu
lated statement." according to
the Daily Northwestern's edito
rial staff. The administration's
defense: But/, was within his
First Amendment right of free
dom of speech to say as he
thought.
School mascot decried
Bethlehem, Pa., Jan. 25 — In
the Lehigh University Brown
and White, an irate letter to the
editor complained about a famil
iar situation — the choice of a
school mascot. Jonathan D. Hall
expressed his distaste with the
traditional symbol and
suggested a school-wide elec
tion to choose something more
representative. Lehigh's mascot:
an engineer.
Hall pointed out that only a
third of Lehigh's students are
pursuing engineering degrees,
and while he appreciates the
alumni's support, he believes
that the mascot should be more
"relevant."

versity student council were

tivities Committee of failing to
