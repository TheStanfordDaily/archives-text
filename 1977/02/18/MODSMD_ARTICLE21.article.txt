# Former Vietnamese Vice-premier rules Mekong
## 
### Harry Killas 
Thirteen years ago, Nguyen-ton Hoan was
vice premier of the Republic of Vietnam. In
cluded in his administrative sphere were the
ministries of interior, education and defense.
But the war displaced many people and to
day, he runs the Mekong Restaurant in
downtown Mountain View.
Huan's present position belies his past. One
would hardly have suspected, as he seated you
and explained the Vietnamese cuisine, that he
once controlled critical segments of Vietnam's
government.
Hoan does not talk much about his days in
power. He left the government in 1965 and
came to the United States in 1966 where he
taught his native language to American ser
vicemen.
Hoan has run the Mekong for almost six years
now.
Hoan said he was interested in introducing
Vietnamese dishes to Americans. "We are very
proud of our culture and the way we eat," he
said. He seemed genuinely concerned that you
enjoy all the dishes from his country.
Because of Vietnam's geographical location,
its cuisine combines the spices and culinary
techniques of China and India. Another influ
ence on Vietnamese cooking was the French
occupation of Indochina.
The authentic menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entries are in the $3 range
and include Vietnamese cuisines, sweet and
sour dishes, barbeques and Krench-inflnenced
dishes such as chicken maison and the Viet
namese omelet. Side dishes and various de
sserts (all in the $1 range) are also listed.
Vietnamese cooking uses marinades and
spices extensively, but they never overpower

the ingredients' own character. The great care
in the preparation ot food at the Mekong is
reflected in the distinct but subtle spicing and
the fresh ingredients. Each dish has a different
marinade and all dishes are prepared to order.
An excellent appetizer is the imperial roll (90
cents). It is similar to the Chinese spring roll,
but is larger, richer in taste and is wrapped in
rice paper. It arrives steaming and, like most
entrees at the Mekong, was garnished with
parsely and pickled carrots.
Of the soups, the abalone and rice soup is
superb. A large bowl of a delicate, flavorful
chicken broth containing white pieces of
abalone, rice and small meat balls, topped with
scallion and pepper, is one of the Mekong's best
dishes.
Most entrees include a crisp salad of iceberg
lettuce, bamboo shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy sauce, vinegar,
garlic and water.
1 fie barbeque chicken ($2.95) is first mari
nated in green onion and soy sauce, then pres
sed into a steak and barbequed. Another dish
typical ot Vietnam is the beef brochette ($3.95),
two bamboo skewers of tender marinated beef
interspersed with crunchy pieces of celery and
green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is worth the calories.
Both fritters — banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple beignets ($1.10) are wonderful. But
the real treat is the house special, banana
beignets smothered with coconut cream and
crushed peanuts.
Before Hoan began running the Mekong, the
building housed a cafe with a cowboy motif.
The Vietnamese decor and ferns have provided
a convincing transformation. Classical guitar
and chamber music contribute to the casual,
civilized atmosphere. Service is unobtrusive.
