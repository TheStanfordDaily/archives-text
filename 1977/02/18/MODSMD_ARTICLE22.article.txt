## Three prep All-Americans Walsh signs top grid recruits 
### Jill Lieber 
Stanford's Athletic Depart
ment is going crazy!
Ever since Wednesday,
phones have been ringing off the
walls. The secretary in the foot
ball office has barely had time to
breathe and the football coaches
are humming the Stanford fight
song.
It's a mania which strikes once
a year when the Cards announce
the football recruits who have
signed the national letter of in
tent. This year Stanford hit the
jackpot — 31 players — 23 high
school stars and eight JC stand
outs.
"We had an extremely good
year for attracting athletes," said
first-year head coach Bill Walsh.
"We had quitea break through in
that we did a lot of out-of-state
recruiting and were able to at
tract those young men who were
highly sought after across the na
tion."
Three All-Americans
The Cards' batch includes
three prep All-Americans who
were recruited by many of the
nation's top football schools.
They are defensive end Brian
Holloway, 6-foot-6, 250-pounds,
from Winston Churchill High in
Potomac, Md., wide receiver
Larry Harris, 6-2, 195, from
Sumner High in Kansas City,
and running back Robbie Chap
man, 6-2, 185, from South
Pasadena.
Holloway was at the top of
Stanford's and USC's recruiting

list. Stanford assistant George
Seifert called him "the best line
prospect in the nation."
Holloway was an All-East
football player and was All-State
in track in both shot put and dis
cus. He will complete in both
events here.
Harris was voted to the Mis
souri All-State first team and the
All-Midlands team. He was the

center of a tug of war in the Mid
west — with the Big Eight Con
ference powers pushing for him
to play football close to home. He
is also an outstanding basketball
player.
Chapman was voted the CIF
3-A division Player of the Year
last season. Over the past two
years he rushed for 3017 yards
and scored 31 touchdowns.
Good student
Linebacker Steve Budinger,
6-2, 210, from Catalina High in
Tucson, Ariz., is an All-State
player and outstanding student
who the Cards are happy to get.
Stanford was up against pres
sure from Arizona and Arizona
State but managed to edge the
two football powerhouses for
Budinger.
Another Arizona boy, John
Werstler, a 6-3, 180-pound de
fensive back/quarterback from
Sahuaro High in Tucson, also
signed his letter of intent.
The Cards went lo Michigan
for two top offensive players.
Fullback Todd Wasik, 6-3, 235,
from Union Lake High in Lake
land, Mich., turned down offers
from nearby football power
Michigan to come to the Farm.
Mike Neil 1. a 6-3, 230, offensive
guard from# Dearborn, Mich.,
will also make the trip west to
attend Stanford.
' Walsh explained why Stan
ford was successful in enticing
out-of-state athletes to the Farm.
'Well organized'
"We were well organized," he
said. "We knew who we wanted
and we were able to convince
them that their best interests lie
in Stanford. It could almost be
called a project because we had
to develop a knowledge of what
Stanford has to offer to work to
ward developing the athletes'
willingness to travel some dis
tance to college. Consequently
we utilized Stanford graduates
and alumni in assisting us in this
endeavor.

' Wo showed the young men
that they could combine the best
education in the United States
with the best in intercollegiate
football."
Walsh is also happy with Stan
ford's success in Southern
California. This is the best re
cruiting year in a long time in
that area which should please
the large numbers of alums who
complained that fired football
coach jack Christiansen missed a
lot of fine talent down South.
Another McColl
Covina's Milt McColl, a 6-5,
205 linebacker — yes, you've got
it — Duncan's brother — will be
the fifth McColl sibling to attend
Stanford. McColl made the All-
CIP second team and was an
All-San Gabriel Valley player.
Stanford lost Ail-American
quarterback Rich Campbell of
San Jose's Santa Teresa High to
California, but the Cards picked
up two other standouts in the
passing department — Grayson

Rogers, 6-3, 205, from Highland
High in Bakersfield and Kevin
McCracken, 6-2, 185, from St.
Francis High in La Canada, earn
ing All-San Gabriel Valley hon
ors.
"Grayson could he the so
called sleeper of all the athletes
we found," Walsh said.
"It was fortunate and unfortu
nate at the same time that he was
not highly publicized. He is of
the latter Day Saints religion and
many schools thought he'd en
roll at Brigham Young.
Walsh left today for his home
in San Diego, optimistic: about
the upcoming season and happy
he's got a "hig load off his shoul
ders" sinctt he has been traveling
every weekend and was in an
athlete's home every night dur
ing the past six weeks.
"I'vegot to move my family up
here," he said. "I've got to go
home and lift boxes like nothing
has happened."
A coach's work is never done.
