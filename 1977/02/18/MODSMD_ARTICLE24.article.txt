# Cards host Washington schools
## 
### Chris Baker 
The drought is on.
It's been almost a month since
Stanford won a basketball game
— 84-71 over Hawaii on Jan. 19
to be exact.
This weekend the Cardinals
will try to end their six-game los
ing streak when Washington and
Washington State visit Maples.
Both contests will be broadcast
on KZSU (90.1 KM).
Stanford opened the Pacific-8
season last month with an 80-68
loss to Washington State in
i'ullman and a televised 98-77
loss to the Huskies.
Tied for second
Washington (6-3 in the Pac-8,
15-7 overall) is hotter than the
temperatures around the Bay
Area this week. The Huskies
moved into a three-way tie for
second place, with Oregon and
Oregon State, after they beat
UCLA for the second time in
three years, 78-73. Saturday
night.
Seven-foot Washington center
lames Edwards, who tried out for
the U.S. Olympic basketball

team, went wild last weekend.
Edwards, who was nicknamed
"Windex" by a USC Daily Tro
jan sports writer because he
cleans the boards, scored 27
points and had 12 rebounds in
Washington's 72-58 victory over
USC.
The following night against
UCLA, Edwards scored 18
points and pulled down 10
boards.
Every Washington starter
finished in double figures
against UCLA. Guards Mike Neil
and Chester Dorsey were the dif
ference in the Huskies' victory
over the Bruins.
Backcourt shines
Neil, who missed the USC
contest, came back to score 20
points against UCLA. His two
free throws with 14 seconds left
iced the victory. Dorsey had 16
points, fiveassists and two steals
against UCLA.
Harshman
Colorful Washington coach
Marv Harshman is still savoring
the victory over the second
ranked Bruins.

"They still have the mystique
of all those national champion
ships. They still are ranked No. 2
in the country and one of the best
four or five teams in thecountry."
Pre-season optimism
When Washington State mas
ter recruiter and sometime coach
George Raveling signed four of
the best big men in the country
last year, a lot of people thought
the Cougars might be able to
challenge UCLA for the Pac-8
crown.
ButWSU hasn't lived up to the
pre-season hype. The Cougars
are 16-6 overall and only 5-4 in
the league. WSU came within
three points of beating UCLA
last week and they will present a
lot of problems for the Cards
Saturday night.
The Cougars will put a lineup
on the floor that includes 6-1 lVz
senior Steve Puidokas and 7-2
sophomore James Donaldson.
Co-captain
Puidokas, the steady senior
co-captain, is the Cougars' sec
ond leading scorer with a 17.3
average.

The Pud was the Pac-8 scoring
champion in 1975 and has been
VVSU's leading rebounder for the
past three years.
But it was sharpshooter
Harold Rhodes who killed Stan
ford last month. Rhodes scored
25 points, hitting 12 of 18 from
the field, in WSU's 80-68 victory
over Stanford.
The senior guard leads the
Cougars with an 1 8.7 scoring av
erage.
But Stanford did itself in last
month in Pullman. Trailing
72-67 with 3:05 left, the Cards
scored only one point in the
clutch.
House
Freshman Stuart House, who
is as big as a house (6-11, 230-
pounds), also did a job on Mike
Bratz, the Cards' leading scorer,
in the first meeting.
House limited Bratz to just two
points in the second half. The
super freshman from Detroit
made every prep All-American
squad last year and had highs of
48 points, 35 rebounds and 21
blocked shots.

Saturday night.
The Cougars will put a lineup
on the floor that includes 6-1 lVz
senior Steve Puidokas and 7-2
sophomore James Donaldson.
Co-captain
Puidokas, the steady senior
co-captain, is the Cougars' sec
ond leading scorer with a 17.3
average.

The Pud was the Pac-8 scoring
champion in 1975 and has been
VVSU's leading rebounder for the
past three years.
But it was sharpshooter
Harold Rhodes who killed Stan
ford last month. Rhodes scored
25 points, hitting 12 of 18 from
the field, in WSU's 80-68 victory
over Stanford.
The senior guard leads the
Cougars with an 1 8.7 scoring av
erage.
But Stanford did itself in last
month in Pullman. Trailing
72-67 with 3:05 left, the Cards
scored only one point in the
clutch.
House
Freshman Stuart House, who
is as big as a house (6-11, 230-
pounds), also did a job on Mike
Bratz, the Cards' leading scorer,
in the first meeting.
House limited Bratz to just two
points in the second half. The
super freshman from Detroit
made every prep All-American
squad last year and had highs of
48 points, 35 rebounds and 21
blocked shots.
The drought is on.
It's been almost a month since
Stanford won a basketball game
— 84-71 over Hawaii on Jan. 19
to be exact.
This weekend the Cardinals
will try to end their six-game los
ing streak when Washington and
Washington State visit Maples.
Both contests will be broadcast
on KZSU (90.1 KM).
Stanford opened the Pacific-8
season last month with an 80-68
loss to Washington State in
i'ullman and a televised 98-77
loss to the Huskies.
Tied for second
Washington (6-3 in the Pac-8,
15-7 overall) is hotter than the
temperatures around the Bay
Area this week. The Huskies
moved into a three-way tie for
second place, with Oregon and
Oregon State, after they beat
UCLA for the second time in
three years, 78-73. Saturday
night.
Seven-foot Washington center
lames Edwards, who tried out for
the U.S. Olympic basketball

team, went wild last weekend.
Edwards, who was nicknamed
"Windex" by a USC Daily Tro
jan sports writer because he
cleans the boards, scored 27
points and had 12 rebounds in
Washington's 72-58 victory over
USC.
The following night against
UCLA, Edwards scored 18
points and pulled down 10
boards.
Every Washington starter
finished in double figures
against UCLA. Guards Mike Neil
and Chester Dorsey were the dif
ference in the Huskies' victory
over the Bruins.
Backcourt shines
Neil, who missed the USC
contest, came back to score 20
points against UCLA. His two
free throws with 14 seconds left
iced the victory. Dorsey had 16
points, fiveassists and two steals
against UCLA.
Harshman
Colorful Washington coach
Marv Harshman is still savoring
the victory over the second
ranked Bruins.

"They still have the mystique
of all those national champion
ships. They still are ranked No. 2
in the country and one of the best
four or five teams in thecountry."
Pre-season optimism
When Washington State mas
ter recruiter and sometime coach
George Raveling signed four of
the best big men in the country
last year, a lot of people thought
the Cougars might be able to
challenge UCLA for the Pac-8
crown.
ButWSU hasn't lived up to the
pre-season hype. The Cougars
are 16-6 overall and only 5-4 in
the league. WSU came within
three points of beating UCLA
last week and they will present a
lot of problems for the Cards
Saturday night.
