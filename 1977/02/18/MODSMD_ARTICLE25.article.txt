# Card track team opens season
## 
### Chris Baker 
Let's get everything out in the
open.
Terry Albritton is one of the
three best shot putters in the
world. James Lofton is one of the
best long jumpers in the nation.
And Stanford has about as good
a chance to win the Pacific-8 or
the NCAAs as Marin County's
prospects for rain.
Albritton and Lofton, both
world-class track and field
athletes, will be on display for
the first time this season out
doors, when the Cards open their
1977 track season tomorrow af
ternoon at 1:15 against Hayward
State in Stanford Stadium.
Lack of depth
Stanford coach Payton Jordan,
now i n his 21st year here, has the
same problem that has plagued
his Cards for years — lack of
depth.
Still, the 1977 campaign
promises to be an interesting one
for Stanford. Albritton is a threat
to set a new world shot put mark
each time he steps into the ring.
"In Terry and James we have
one of the best one-two punches
of any team in the NCAA," said
Jordan. "We'll have an exciting,
competitive team — one sprink
led with high quality athletes.
But we'll still be short on man
power in certain areas.
Stanford's distance and hur
dles corps have been heavily de
pleted, with the graduation of
Tony Sandoval, the Pacific-8
10,000 meter king, John Foster,

one of the country's top hurdlers
and Jack Bellah, school record
holder in the steeplechase (a
scoring event this year).
Lofton had a good indoor sea
son. The j.unior, who placed
third in the NCAA meet last
spring and fifth in the U.S.
Olympic trials last year, has a
best of 25-9 3/4 and an indoor
leap of 25-7 this year- He will also
double in the sprints and relays.
Freshman Gordy Banks, the
leading rusher on the JV football
team, will join senior Marvin
Holmes in the short sprints.
Juniors Alan Sheats and Lofton
will also provide the Cards with
strength in the 200 and 400.
Good speed
Sheats, Lofton, Banks and
Holmes give Stanford, what Jor
dan calls "the best combina
tion of running speed we've had
since our world record team ol
1965-Eric Frische, Dale Rubin,
Bob Mclntyre and Larry Questad
in 39.7."
Lofton and Sheats will also
compete in the 1600-meter relay.
Paul McCarthy and Tom
Shellworth complete the quar
tet, which Jordan feels has a
chance to break the school mark
of 3:10.5. Banks and junior col
lege transfer Don Wells may also
run legs for the squad.
Senior Steve Crowley, who
finished sixth in the 1975 Pac-8
mile run. will lead the Cards in
the 1500. Crowley had a slump
last year after spending two
quarters overseas.
