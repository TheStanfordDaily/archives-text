# Terry Albritton views amateur athletics, Stanford
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
He is the former world record holder
in the shot put. He boasts being the
games-room champion of the world — a
true pinball wizard.
He stands 6-foot-4 and weighs 260
pounds. He claims to have "the fastest
hips in the West," reference to his exp
losive ness in the seven-foot ring in
which he practices his art.
He is a sports revolutionary who be
lieves sports in America must assume a
new direction, and he offers one. I le as
sures his listener that as a freshman he
was the world's horniest 18-year-old.
After a three-year absence from the
Farm. Terry Albritton is back at Stanford
and with the outdoor track and field sea
son beginning tomorrow, the Daily felt
its readers should have a chance to get to
know the most recent addition to Payton
Jordan's track squad.
With that goal in mind, Albritton and
this writer left campus one night this
week to a quiet pizza parlor on El
Camino in Menlo Park where an inter
view could be conducted over a few
pitchers of beer.
Daily: When you came here four years
ago you became the first Stanford shot
putter to ever surpass 60 feet. It was your
first year here and already you were on
top of things. What made you decide to
leave?
Albritton: "I came here as a football
player. I was recruited as a football
player and originally 1 played on the
freshman team.
"For a long time in high school and
my first year here I had been developing
a resentment for the ultimate authority
of football coaches because it really
sucked the fun out of the game.
"They placed nil the emphasis on
winning and I think that undermines
the whole value of sports. I don't place
any value on winning or losing. We
should strive to stress participation.
"I don't blame the coaches. They're
cast into a position where they have to
win in order to keep their jobs.

"The boil came to a point and 1 finally
realized that playing football and being
in that environment wasn't me. I wanted
to perceive sports as something more
than just a war game with the only thing
that counts is who wins.
"I wanted to attack sport scientifi
cally, to think of myself as a scientist in
pursuit of an abstract which is what a
world's record is. Track and field of
fered that to me.
"Track and field athletes are a diffe
rent breed: they're artists, they're scien
tists. They're not soldiers. They're not
fighting a war."
Daily: What did you do when you left
Stanford?
Albritton: "When I finally rejected
football, I thought I'd go far, far away. I
laid out a year of school after my
freshman year and was down in South
ern California for a year training. One of
my friends down there is Jim Neidhart
(Neidhart is an outstanding shot putter
who attended the same high school as
Albritton and later competed for IJCI.A).
"We're sitting in a bar one nigiit and
he was saying, 'Wouldn't it be nice to go
off to an island or some place and find
some training hideaway.' And I said,
'Yeah, that would be nice; that's food for
thought. 1 wonder if Hawaii has a uni
versity with a track team.' We wrote the
athletic department and the track coach
sent back a letter saying he was in
terested."
Daily: In spite of the fact that Hawaii
dropped its track program this year,
would you characterize your experience
there as a good one?
Albritton: "Yes. It offered mean out
let to live out my fantasy to get a-vny
from it all. It was definitely a goo<' ex
perience."
Daily: Earlier you portrayed track
athletes as scientists. Expand on this.
Albritton: "Every shot putter I knew
that's at the top plots their body weight
daily, plots the lifts that they do, the
throws that they take, the distances at
meets, the workouts they have. They see

through the feedback of their throwing
which programs have best met their
needs in terms of peaking them. Scien
tific method, accumulation of empirical
data, these things characterize the ap
proach of most guys."
A high school student from Menlo-
Atherton named Becky draws up to the
table and speaks.
Becky: Excuse me, is your name Terry
Albritton?
Albritton: "Yeah." (With a grin.)
Becky: Are you serious?"
Albritton: "No. My name's really
Ceorge.
"No. I'm Terry."
Becky: "My brother told me to come
over here."
Albritton: "Your brother told you. I
would have enjoyed it much more if you
would have said you wanted to come
over here."
Albritton signs an autograph for her.
Suddenly, he draws a crowd of about
half-a-dozen.
Someone in the crowd asks Albritton
about the Olympics, not realizing that
the spectacled shot putter had finished
fourth in the U.S. Olympic Trials, one
place short of a trip to Montreal.
Albritton: "In May I broke the world
record in practice by two feet. Two days
later I was so psyched I went in the
weight room and tried 80 pounds more
than I'd ever done in the bench press.
My pectoralis minor tore completely off
its insertion and rolled up in my chest. It
knocked me out of it."
Crowd: Terry, how about the AAU?
I've heard a lot of people want to get out.
Albritton: "Hey, I'm one of them. Our
entire amateur system in America is
wrong. The only true amateur sports are
pick-up basketball and stuff like that
where guys are ju st out for the recreation
and participation.
"We have to get over all this amateur
crap, these ideals we have. All it is is
remnants of nineteenth-century En
glish, Victorian, bourgeois society
where thev had to idea that a gentleman

didn't work. And if he received money
for anything be did, that kind of pol
luted its value.
"What it essentially did was exclude
the working man from sport. That's
what it was measured to do because they
realized the working man would kick
their asses if he ever got involved. Well,
now the working man is the one who is
doing it and we still have the same an
tiquated rules.
"I don't think government is the right
direction to correct things. I think that
the right direction would be for us as
athletes to band together and charter
nonprofit organizations and recruit
businesses in the private sector to do
nate money for us to give clinics. We'd
recruit kids to come out and learn what
skills we have. 1 think we should be paid
as social workers, not as performers or
entertainers."
Daily: It was only a month after your
twenty-first birthday that you threw
71-BV2 in Honolulu to establish a new
world record. Most weight men don't
peak until their mid-twenties. You were
a mere toddler.
Albritton: "Well, you have to con
sider first that when I was 16-yearsold I
set the world record for 16-year olds.
When I was 19, I broke the world junior
record which had been 65-feet and I
threw 69%-feet. I beat it by four feet. So
my developments have come rather
rapid at an early age.
"Hey. the record just excited the shit
out of me. I was on Cloud Nine for
weeks.
"I knew it was coming. I told everyone
I knew to come to the meet because I was
going to break the world record. It was
an all-comers meet and there were 5000
people there and mo>t of them were my
friends. It was that much more gratify
ing because 1 was surrounded by my
friends."
