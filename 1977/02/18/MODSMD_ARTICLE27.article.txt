## USC's John Naber 
### Jill Lieber 
After reading numerous feature articles and
viewing television interviews, I had pegged
USC swimmer John Naber, winner of four gold
and one silver medal at the Montreal Olympics,
as "Mr. Nice Guy." And I spent last Saturday
morning chatting with him at Rickey's Hyatt
House, and you know, I wasn't disappointed.
Mr. Nice Guy.
The All American Boy.
Why he's so friendly he even interviewed me!
"I never meet anyone I sign autographs for,"
the 22-year-old senior psych major disappoin
tedly said. "People shake my hand and say 'Nice
meeting you' and 1 just think, 'Yeah, sure' know
ing they really didn't learn anything from it.
"Autographs are a waste of time. Six inches of
ink on a piece of paper doesn't mean anything."
Sex appeal
1 watched Naber handle the hordes of vultur
ous swimming groupies. When he exited
through the lockerroom door after the Gal meet
last Friday afternoon, there was a mad rush of
high school girls with Farrah Fawcett hairstyles,
dressed in tight jump suits.
"Alright," Naber said. "Those of you who
want autographs over here in a straight line."
Then he pointed to the other side of the pool
deck.
"If you want pictures, then over there."
The girls scampered to the other side of the
pool with Instamatics dangling from their arms.
Naber followed.
Posing for pictures he embraced the young
ladies and gave 'em the famous John Naber ear to
ear grin.
But it wasn't a reul smile.
Gotta be me
"I'd like to be in the background again," he
said. "1 never geared my life after publicity. 1
don't need someone to buy me a drink when I go
into a restaurant and I certainly don't need to go
to a movie, have my arm around my date and
have a head peer in between us and say, 'Clan 1
have your autograph?' "
Naber said he is noticed away from the pool
and enjoys watching the different reactions.
"Usually people say, '1 know your face, what's
your name again?' And alot of people say, 'Hi,
lim.'
i was concerned this summer after theGames
• -hen I went back to school that I'd be treated as

something I wasn't a year ago, and in some ways
it's happened.
"People will come out of crowds and intro
duce themselves to me and it's neat — a real ego
trip. But often times it's not real.
"1 ride my bike around campus and people do
a double take. I see people pointing to me so 1
point back."
Avoiding the crowds
Since the Olympics Naber has moved into an
apartment at USC. Last year he was an RA — a
mother hen to 25 students. But he felt his title as
Olympic gold medal swimmer might create
superficial relationships, so he moved out of the
dorms.
Naber now spends time with "the cream of the
cream -of the crop" of his friends at 'SC. He
answers mail three hours each week, attends
Bible studies twice weekly and cooks, proclaim
ing himself as the "master of the 15-minute
meal."
For Naber, the hassles of being an Olympic
standout — banquets, autographs and lack of
privacy — are far surpassed by the "good" of the
Games.The Olympics gave Naber a lasting self
confidence which will enable him to succeed in
any facet of life.
I think 1 can
"The Olympics made it clear to me that any
body can go from a nobody to being the best in
the world in whatever they do. They gave me a
lot of faith in myself and my capacity as a person.
"They shrank the entire world into a very
small pond where I could be a really big fish — if
I only decided to be one. Now 1 can go into the
world and say, '1 want to be the best
businessman' and I know I'll be the best if I
commit myself and make sacrifices."
Now it's your turn
When 1 finished interviewing Naber he said,
"Okay, put away your notes and ask me whatyou
want to know."
We talked for almost 45 minutes asking each
other questions that any college student asks
another college student.
Then he turned to me and asked, "Tell me
honestly, would you like to be me?"
I paused and said, "No."
He flashed a reul Naberly smile and hugged
me.

1 watched Naber handle the hordes of vultur
ous swimming groupies. When he exited
through the lockerroom door after the Gal meet
last Friday afternoon, there was a mad rush of
high school girls with Farrah Fawcett hairstyles,
dressed in tight jump suits.
"Alright," Naber said. "Those of you who
want autographs over here in a straight line."
Then he pointed to the other side of the pool
deck.
"If you want pictures, then over there."
The girls scampered to the other side of the
pool with Instamatics dangling from their arms.
Naber followed.
Posing for pictures he embraced the young
ladies and gave 'em the famous John Naber ear to
ear grin.
But it wasn't a reul smile.
Gotta be me
"I'd like to be in the background again," he
said. "1 never geared my life after publicity. 1
don't need someone to buy me a drink when I go
into a restaurant and I certainly don't need to go
to a movie, have my arm around my date and
have a head peer in between us and say, 'Clan 1
have your autograph?' "
Naber said he is noticed away from the pool
and enjoys watching the different reactions.
"Usually people say, '1 know your face, what's
your name again?' And alot of people say, 'Hi,
lim.'

Avoiding the crowds
Since the Olympics Naber has moved into an
apartment at USC. Last year he was an RA — a
mother hen to 25 students. But he felt his title as
Olympic gold medal swimmer might create
superficial relationships, so he moved out of the
dorms.
Naber now spends time with "the cream of the
cream -of the crop" of his friends at 'SC. He
answers mail three hours each week, attends
Bible studies twice weekly and cooks, proclaim
ing himself as the "master of the 15-minute
meal."
For Naber, the hassles of being an Olympic
standout — banquets, autographs and lack of
privacy — are far surpassed by the "good" of the
Games.The Olympics gave Naber a lasting self
confidence which will enable him to succeed in
any facet of life.

"The Olympics made it clear to me that any
body can go from a nobody to being the best in
the world in whatever they do. They gave me a
lot of faith in myself and my capacity as a person.
"They shrank the entire world into a very
small pond where I could be a really big fish — if
I only decided to be one. Now 1 can go into the
world and say, '1 want to be the best
businessman' and I know I'll be the best if I
commit myself and make sacrifices."
Now it's your turn
When 1 finished interviewing Naber he said,
"Okay, put away your notes and ask me whatyou
want to know."
We talked for almost 45 minutes asking each
other questions that any college student asks
another college student.
Then he turned to me and asked, "Tell me
honestly, would you like to be me?"
I paused and said, "No."
He flashed a reul Naberly smile and hugged
me.

After reading numerous feature articles and
viewing television interviews, I had pegged
USC swimmer John Naber, winner of four gold
and one silver medal at the Montreal Olympics,
as "Mr. Nice Guy." And I spent last Saturday
morning chatting with him at Rickey's Hyatt
House, and you know, I wasn't disappointed.
Mr. Nice Guy.
The All American Boy.
Why he's so friendly he even interviewed me!
"I never meet anyone I sign autographs for,"
the 22-year-old senior psych major disappoin
tedly said. "People shake my hand and say 'Nice
meeting you' and 1 just think, 'Yeah, sure' know
