# Raquetball craze hits Stanford
## 
### Richard Keller 
For all you tennis players who
double-fault on match point —
don't despair. Break your racket
in half, get it regripped and play
the fastest growing racket sport
in the country: racquetball.
To play racquetball, the only
necessary equipment is a rac
quet. a ball and a court. The rac
quets vaguely resemble sawed
off tennis rackets, and are usu
ally 18-19 inches in length. They
are generally strung at about 29
pounds compared to 55-60
pounds for tennis rackets. Cost
ranges from $5 to $60. The ball is
2V4 inches in diameter, and has
much more bounce than its
counterpart in tennis.
Racquetball courts, which are
exactly the same as handball
courts, are small white rooms
that measure 20feet wide, 20feet
high and 40 feet long. Except on
the serve, any portion of the
court including the ceiling may
be hit. The object is to have the
ball bounce twice before your
opponent can reach it. Two out
of three games constitute a
match, and each match is played
to 21 points. You must be serv
ing to receive a point.
In 1969. Bud Held founded
Ektelon, the first racquetball
racquet manufacturing com
pany. Held, a 1950 Stanford
graduate, continued an illustri
ous athletic career in the busi
ness world. He held the NCAA
javelin title for three consecutive
years while at Stanford, and set
three world records from 1953 to
1956.
Inventor
Held has made a living from
designing revolutionary inven

tions in the sporting goods in
dustry. After being a minister for
12 years, he invented a new jave
lin, a racquet stringing machine
that now holds a 60 per cent
share of the market, the
aluminum tennis racquet and fi
nally the aluminum racquetball
racquet in 1969. Before that rac
quetball racquets were made of
wood.
"Racquetball was an instant
success," said the Stanford
alum. "One of the guys in San
Diego (where the modern sport
began), Dr. Bud Meuhleisen,
asked me to make him an
aluminum racquetball racquet.
So 1 did, and he and his partner
won the National doubles that
year (1969) with my racquets. It
took off after that. The number of
players is doubling every year."
Locally, in addition to Stan
ford's deGuerre complex, there
is only one place to play. "The
Court," located behind the Old
Mill shopping center in Moun
tain View, had its grand opening
last Monday. The club was
started by Jim Gerber and his
partner John Melin, who is a stu
dent in Stanford Business
School.
Fred Von Appen, Stanford's
new defensive line coach, also
apeaks highly of the sport. "We
encourage it to the man," he
said. "It's a great physical con
ditioner. It's also good for hand
eye coordination and foot
quickness.
Training
"Off-season programs," he
continued, "are swinging away
from a heavy emphasis on
weight training. The reason is
that the time demands are exces

sive. To ask them to tie up an
inordinant amount of their off
season time is unfair. With rac
quetball, they can have fun and
still get physically fit. The only
problem is that there aren't
enough facilities."
DeGuerre courts are ex
periencing their own racquetball
boom. deGuerre was originally
intended to have four squash
courts and four handball courts.
Three of the handball courts,
however, are now being used for
racquetball.
Each court reservation is for
one hour. Since deGuerre is
open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on week
days and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
weekends, there is a total of 216
court hours for racquetballers
per week. That satisfied only
about half the demand, however.
Challenge courts on the first
come first serve basis have done
little to alleviate the situation.
deGuerre crush
Every day this quarter at 11
a.m., over 86 people dash
down to the sign-up desk in
hopes of obtaining a reservation.
Most of those in line are racquet
ball players. Earlier this year,
when the demand wasn't as
great, anyone could call in and
get a court. Now the attendant
just leaves the phone off the
hook. He has been instructed to
give priority to the players who
show up in person.
The attendants are upset be
cause the reservation system is
inefficient, the racquetball
players are upset that the court
hours aren't longer, the people
who call in are upset because
they can't do just that and the
handball players are upset at the

racquetball players for pirating
their court space.
"I've been expecting you,"
said sophomore |ohn McClintic,
who has been behind the reser
vation desk since the beginning
of the year. "It's gbtten progres
sively worse. It used to be that
people could call in for reserva
tions. But now they are coming
down in person. If you aren't
here in line by 10:30 you aren't
going to get a court. I have to turn
down about 60 callers in the first
hour."
Radiology resident and rac
quetball fanatic Barry Robbins
offered his opinion on the state
of affairs at deGuerre:
Longer hours
"They have to extend the
hours," he complained. "I've re
searched it very carefully. There
are 25 to 30 people who can't
play every week because the
courts are locked. The guy at the
desk makes $2.50 an hour. If they
opened it for four more hours
just on the weekends, it would
only cost $20 per week more."
Psychology Prof. Seymour
Levine has another problem; he
is a handball player. As part of a
vanishing breed, he said. "We're
being squeezed out. The percen
tage of handball players had di
minished. I find that I play
squash more than handball be
cause I can't get a court."
"Racquetball has gone
bullshit," said Jeff Hammett,
manager of the deGuerre com
plex. "Longer hours are possi
ble, but we spend $35,000 a year
in casual labor. It adds up."
Wes Ruff, chairman of the
physical education department,
probably wishes racquetball was
never invented. He was to ans
wer to all the strains that the
sport has put on his facilities.
Said Ruff, "Last quarter we
were open from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Less than 50 per cent of the
courts were filled before 11 in
the morning. But now it's like an
avalanche. It's an impossible
situation.
"We are locked into 72 hours a
week. Part of this is budget. Still
we could change (have extra
hours). I tried to set-up a punch
card system that would cost $5
for 10 courts) like the one used at
the golf course, but there was too
much pressure from energy
groups. The department is al
ways under pressure from the
University to cut energy usage
down.
"If we hadn't had the in
tramural handball tournament
superimposed, we wouldn't
have such a problem." he con
tinued, "It was an out and out
error. We are probably going to
eliminate the intramural prog
ram in the building all together.
Ruff also indicated that he is
planning to reactivate the
student-faculty committee that
forms the policy for the deGuerre
courts "very soon." It was dis
banded several years ago.

Waiting for a court
The growing popularity of raquetball on the Farm has caused problems for the deGuerre Complex.
Students must wait in line to sign up for a court everyday at 11 a.m.
