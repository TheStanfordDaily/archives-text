# USE sues University over hospital survey
## 
### Bill Burger 
A University survey being distri
buted among hospital and Medical
Center workers has prompted Unitod
Stanford Employees (USE) Local 680
to file unfair labor practice charges
against the University.
The charges, filed Wednesday, state
that the University is violating the Na
tional Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by
distributing surveys which are not
voluntary and do not guarantee
anonymity.
Ron Twomey, director of personnel
at the Med Center, defended the Uni
versity's action, saying, "We're only
trying to find out what the employes
think about conditions where they

work, and we feel it is management's
responsibility to find out."
The survey, designed to inform
management and supervisors of
worker attitudes, began on Feb. 8 in
the hospital, and on Feb. 15 in the
Medical Center.
Anne Schlagenhaft, acting USE
president, said the survey "is exactly
the type of thing the union should be
doing. The University goes about its
business as if we (the union) didn't
exist."
Schlagenhaft said "supervisors at
the two facilities keep asking whether
or not employes have taken the sur
vey." This is not, according to
Schlagenhaft, a voluntary system.
Schlagenhaft then compared the
current situation to the 1975 spring
elections at the hospital, where, in her
words, "the workers were told they
would be fired if they voted against the
union."
The survey was also not anonymous,
.said Schlagenhaft, because "there
were several questions which could
easily identify the respective
employes to the management."
According to Schlagenhaft, workers
are asked their sex, their age bracket,
their educational level, their depart
ment in which they work, shift and
when they began working there.
Ron Twomey also added union offi
cials were consulted three months ago
when the University planned the sur
vey.
