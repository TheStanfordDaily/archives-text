Oil and gas leases nullified
New York—The federal government's first oil and
natural gas leases in the Atlantic Ocean were nul
lified yesterday by a U.S. district court judge, who
said they violated the environmental law.
The action by Judge Jack Weinstein forbids any
drilling on the 214,000 acres, 50 to 90 miles off the
coast, tliat were leased to 39 oil companies for $1.13
billion last August.
Before drilling can begin, the Interior Department
must rework its study of the environmental impact,
which could take several months, and then hold a
new lease sale, an attorney involved in the case said.
But Weinstein said his decision would not take
effect until the government has had a chance to ap
peal it, and Asst. U.S. Atty. Cyril Hyman, who rep
resented the government, said that was being consi
dered.
Chicago schools face fund cutoff
Chicago—Citing evidence of deliberate racial
segregation, a federal hearing officer yesterday or
dered a cutoff of federal funds to Chicago public
schools.
The order, which is final unless the school district
appeals within 20 days, was signed by the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Ad
ministrative Law Judge Everett Hammarstrom. It
makes Chicago the Nation's seventh school district,
and by far the largest, threatened with loss of federal
funds.
Earlier yesterday, HEW Secretary Joseph Claifano
Jr. ordered a review of the other six cases, all involv
ing Texas or Arkansas districts and at least a year old.
In Chicago, Hammarstrom said, there was evi
denceof "an historical pattern of purposeful acts and
omissions which fostered a separation of the races."
His order jeopardized more than $100 million in
federal funding received by Chicago schools each
year, a school spokesman said. The district's annual
operating budget is about $000 million.

Revised tax rebate approved
Washington—A tax rebate of $50 for almost every
American who earned $25,000 or less last year and a
permanent tax cut tor 45 million persons or families
who use the standard deduction was approved yes
terday by the House Ways and Means Committee.
The rebate, a variation of one proposed by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter as the centerpiece of his
economic-stimulus program, would be a one-time
only deal, payable to most recipients in Mayor June.
The permanent tax cut, averaging $90 a year, would
become effective on May 1 by lowering the amount
withheld from paychecks.
At the same time, the panel agreed to extend
through 197H the existing $:*5-per-person tax credit
and special credit for the working poor.
The committee continued work on business tax
cut sections of the plan that Carter has proposed in
an effort to spur the economy. Chairman Al Ullman
(D-Ore.) planned to finish the bill yesterday evening.
'Post reports CIA secret payments
Washington — The CIA has made secret annual
payments totaling millions of dollars over 20 years to
King Hussein of Jordan, according to The
Washington Post.
The Intelligence Oversight Board, a special panel
created to curb abuses by the CIA, reported the
payoffs last year to President Gerald Ford as an
impropriety, but Ford did nothing to stop them, the
Post reported in today's editions.
It said President Jimmy Carter learned of the
payoffs earlier this week "after this newspaper began
its investigation." He ordered tjie payments stopped,
the Post said.
The secret arrangement with Hussein had not been
disclosed to Carter by the CIA or any member of the
Ford administration, the newspaper reported. It de
scribed Carter as "distressed" at this.
Car wreck kills Amin dissenters
Kampala, Uganda — The Anglican archbishop of

Uganda and two cabinet ministers were killed in
what the government said yesterday was a motor
vehicle accident. It occurred after they had been
accused of plotting against President Idi Amin.
The government said Archbishop Janani Luwum,
Internal Affairs Minister Charles Oboth-Ofumbe and
Lt. Col. Orinayo Oryeman, minister of land and
water resources, were being taken for questioning
Wednesday when they tried to overpower the driver,
causing the accident.
Amin was described by a senior government offi
cial as "shocked and stunned" by the deaths. "There
was no foul play whatever," said the official. "It was
just one of those terribly sad things."
However, the deaths set off a new international
outcry against Amin, who has been accused of ruling
his East African nation by terror since he deposed
President Milton Obote in 1971. Amin has survived
numerous alleged plots to oust him.
Angered isle attempts succession
Chilmark. Mass. — Residents of pastoral Martha's
Vineyard island, angered by the prospect of losing
their only delegate to the state legislature, are trying
to secede from theCommonwealth of Massachusetts.
And there is talk of seceding from the entire nation
to become eligible for U.S. foreign aid.
Louis King, a Chilmark selectman who voted
against secession, said, "The purpose of all this is
publicity."
Selectmen on the island, a summer spa and a
paradise for fishing and yachting, cast their 10-2 vote
for secession at a meeting Wednesday night.
In Colonial times, the political leanings of Nan
tucket were toward England. Martha's Vineyard was
considered almost neutral in the Revolutionary War.
And it is still common for Nantucket residents, when
journeying to the mainland, to say, "I'm going to
America."
Today's weather
Pair and mild through tomorrow with patchy
morning fog or low clouds. Lows in the 40s to low
50s. Highs in the upper 60s and 70s. Light winds.
