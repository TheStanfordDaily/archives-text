# Textile firm boycott shortsheeted here
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
An attempt last night to organize
support here for a national boycott of
certain sheets, pillowcases and carpets
attracted only a handful of persons to
Roble Hall's Blue Lounge.
About 15 persons came to the meet
ing to discuss a boycott of J.P. Stevens
& Co.. the nation's second largest tex
tile manufacturer.
Peter Necarsulmer, a meeting or
ganizer. said the group will also en
courage the University, which is a
shareholder in Stevens, to vote in favor
of two resolutions at a Stevens
shareholder's meeting March 1 in New
York City.
The resolutions call for a disclosure
of company compliance with equal
employment opportunity and affirma
tive action laws and a written descrip
tion of company labor policies and
practices. They were written by a coal
ition of five religious groups which
holds 42,618 shares of Stevens stock.
Stevens is "regarded by the union
(Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union - ACTWU) as the most
relentlessly anti-union company in a
generally anti-union industry," the
New York Times reported last Dec. 18.
The company has also been found
guilty by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) in 15 cases of illegally
discharging workers or refusing to
bargain in good faith.
The company has lost 11 court ap
peals on the NLRB rulings, according
to the; Times. As a result, it has doled
out $1.3 million in back pay and has
paid the union $50,000 in an out-of
court settlement for a 1974 charge of
bugging union organizers' motel
rooms in South Carolina, the Times
reported.
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance here, said he
received a proxy ballot for the
shareholder's meeting last week.
However, he said he does not i nfend to
refer this one to the Presidential Com
mission on Investment Responsibility
IC-IR).
The C-IR is composed of faculty,
students and alumni who consider
such matters as proxy votes for Uni

versity investments, said Augsburger.
"We could simply not have the
proxy voted on at all," Augsburger
said. He explained that Stevens was a
"minor account over which we have
no control.
'Holding company'
"The donor gave the funds to us. We
are acting like their holding company.
We received about 3000 shares. Usu
ally, in investments, the University
holds 50.000 to 100,000 shares," Au
gsburger said.
Harry Turner, assistant director of
finance, confirmed that the University
had an "extremely minor holding" of
3000 shares. On Wednesday the price
per share closed at 19Vb.
"These shares are held in trust by us
for the benefit of the donors as long as
they live. All dividends are paid to the
beneficiaries. After they (the be
neficiaries) die, only then do they (the
dividends) come to Stanford. But we
do vote the proxy," Turner said.
"I do know we nearly always vote a
proxy," said Turner. "We will take ex
ception with management occasion
ally." He added that the bulk of Uni
versity assets are invested in sums of
half a million dollars or more.
'Critical areas'
Augsburger said he had discussed
not referring this proxy to the C-IR
with Director of Finance Rodney
Adams. He said that while the com
mission does consider issues such as
investments in corporations which
have factories in South Africa and "a
few other critical areas," the Univer
sity prefers to "concentrate where we
can address issues with the most im
pact," mainly where the University
has larger share holdings.
"We have to channel our energies to
those (issues) that have more impact
on us and relevance; to those issues
more under the policy guidelines ot
the University," Adams said.
"We've been asked to take positions
ranging all over the map to show 'our
concern,' "continued Adams. "It's not
all that simple to do. What is right?
What is wrong?
"That's not to say that some of the
issues are not worthv of arguing for

and supporting. The unfortunate thing
with these proxy issues is that there is
not enough time to have them go
through a sequence of analytical
steps," he said.
Multinational
Stevens is a multinational corpora
tion with 63 of its 85 U.S. plants lo
cated in North and South Carolina.
The company realized net sales of
$1.42 billion dollars and net income
after taxes of $41 million in 1976, ac
cording to its 1976 annual report.

None of its 44,000 employes are co
vered by a union contract, according to
ACTWU. Only seven Stevens plants,
all located in Roanoke Rapids, N.C.,
have held successful National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) elections for
union representation.
However, contract negotiations at
Roanoke Rapids, ordered by the Sec
ond Circuit Court of Appeals in 1974,
have not made significant progress,
stated the ACTWU.
"The company rejects all proposals

for voluntary check-off of union dues
because that would permit the union
to develop the financial support
needed to sustain itself," stated an
ACTWIJ press release.
Rejected all proposals
The union also claimed that the
company rejected all proposals for
grievance arbitration.
"These two items are negotiable,"
according to Stevens' Industrial Rela
tions Manager Paul Barrett, contacted
in South Carolina yesterday.
"It is understood that anything on
the contract has to be agreed upon by
both parties. These two matters (vol
untary check-off and grievance arbitra
tion) are not in the best interests of the
company," he said.
According to the Interfaith Center
on Corporate Responsibility proxy, the
Fifth Circuit Court has found the com
pany in contempt because of its refusal
to bargain in good faith.
The Interfaith Center is comprised of
the World Division, Board of Clobal
Ministries of the United Methodist
Church; the Franciscan Justice' and
Peace Office of Washington, D.C.; the

Institute of Christian Doctrine; Fran
ciscan Missionaries of Mary and the
Catholic Foreign Mission Society of
America, Inc. (the Maryknoll Fathers).
The coalition stated that its resolu
tion, if approved by a majority of the
shareholders would provide
shareholders with "factual and accu
rate data" on labor practices so
shareholders would be "able to assess
the potential financial impact ot prot
racted conflict with the unionization
effort."
Stevens' Barrett said three of the 15
NLRB violation rulings were over
turned by the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals. The number of guilty rulings
"is insignificant over a 1A year
period," Barrett said.
The Interfaith Center proxy said the
15 cases in which the company was
found guilty by the NLRB have "meant
needless legal and administrative ex
penses and adverse publicity."
Barrett said the threatened nation
wide boycott of Stevens products has
not affected sales so far.
"The only thing we know about it
(boycott) is what we read in the pap
ers," he said.
In the event of a boycott, Barrett said
Stevens "plans to take all legal steps"
to stop any illegal activities under the
boycott.

Harry Turner, assistant director of
finance, confirmed that the University
had an "extremely minor holding" of
3000 shares. On Wednesday the price
per share closed at 19Vb.
"These shares are held in trust by us
for the benefit of the donors as long as
they live. All dividends are paid to the
beneficiaries. After they (the be
neficiaries) die, only then do they (the
dividends) come to Stanford. But we
do vote the proxy," Turner said.
"I do know we nearly always vote a
proxy," said Turner. "We will take ex
ception with management occasion
ally." He added that the bulk of Uni
versity assets are invested in sums of
half a million dollars or more.
'Critical areas'
Augsburger said he had discussed
not referring this proxy to the C-IR
with Director of Finance Rodney
Adams. He said that while the com
mission does consider issues such as
investments in corporations which
have factories in South Africa and "a
few other critical areas," the Univer
sity prefers to "concentrate where we
can address issues with the most im
pact," mainly where the University
has larger share holdings.
"We have to channel our energies to
those (issues) that have more impact
on us and relevance; to those issues
more under the policy guidelines ot
the University," Adams said.
"We've been asked to take positions
ranging all over the map to show 'our
concern,' "continued Adams. "It's not
all that simple to do. What is right?
What is wrong?
"That's not to say that some of the
issues are not worthv of arguing for

and supporting. The unfortunate thing
with these proxy issues is that there is
not enough time to have them go
through a sequence of analytical
steps," he said.
Multinational
Stevens is a multinational corpora
tion with 63 of its 85 U.S. plants lo
cated in North and South Carolina.
The company realized net sales of
$1.42 billion dollars and net income
after taxes of $41 million in 1976, ac
cording to its 1976 annual report.

None of its 44,000 employes are co
vered by a union contract, according to
ACTWU. Only seven Stevens plants,
all located in Roanoke Rapids, N.C.,
have held successful National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) elections for
union representation.
However, contract negotiations at
Roanoke Rapids, ordered by the Sec
ond Circuit Court of Appeals in 1974,
have not made significant progress,
stated the ACTWU.
"The company rejects all proposals

for voluntary check-off of union dues
because that would permit the union
to develop the financial support
needed to sustain itself," stated an
ACTWIJ press release.
Rejected all proposals
The union also claimed that the
company rejected all proposals for
grievance arbitration.
"These two items are negotiable,"
according to Stevens' Industrial Rela
tions Manager Paul Barrett, contacted
in South Carolina yesterday.
"It is understood that anything on
the contract has to be agreed upon by
both parties. These two matters (vol
untary check-off and grievance arbitra
tion) are not in the best interests of the
company," he said.
According to the Interfaith Center
on Corporate Responsibility proxy, the
Fifth Circuit Court has found the com
pany in contempt because of its refusal
to bargain in good faith.
The Interfaith Center is comprised of
the World Division, Board of Clobal
Ministries of the United Methodist
Church; the Franciscan Justice' and
Peace Office of Washington, D.C.; the

Institute of Christian Doctrine; Fran
ciscan Missionaries of Mary and the
Catholic Foreign Mission Society of
America, Inc. (the Maryknoll Fathers).
The coalition stated that its resolu
tion, if approved by a majority of the
shareholders would provide
shareholders with "factual and accu
rate data" on labor practices so
shareholders would be "able to assess
the potential financial impact ot prot
racted conflict with the unionization
effort."
Stevens' Barrett said three of the 15
NLRB violation rulings were over
turned by the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals. The number of guilty rulings
"is insignificant over a 1A year
period," Barrett said.
The Interfaith Center proxy said the
15 cases in which the company was
found guilty by the NLRB have "meant
needless legal and administrative ex
penses and adverse publicity."
Barrett said the threatened nation
wide boycott of Stevens products has
not affected sales so far.
"The only thing we know about it
(boycott) is what we read in the pap
ers," he said.
In the event of a boycott, Barrett said
Stevens "plans to take all legal steps"
to stop any illegal activities under the
boycott.
An attempt last night to organize
support here for a national boycott of
certain sheets, pillowcases and carpets
attracted only a handful of persons to
Roble Hall's Blue Lounge.
About 15 persons came to the meet
ing to discuss a boycott of J.P. Stevens
& Co.. the nation's second largest tex
tile manufacturer.
Peter Necarsulmer, a meeting or
ganizer. said the group will also en
courage the University, which is a
shareholder in Stevens, to vote in favor
of two resolutions at a Stevens
shareholder's meeting March 1 in New
York City.
The resolutions call for a disclosure
of company compliance with equal
employment opportunity and affirma
tive action laws and a written descrip
tion of company labor policies and
practices. They were written by a coal
ition of five religious groups which
holds 42,618 shares of Stevens stock.
Stevens is "regarded by the union
(Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union - ACTWU) as the most
relentlessly anti-union company in a
generally anti-union industry," the
New York Times reported last Dec. 18.
The company has also been found
guilty by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) in 15 cases of illegally
discharging workers or refusing to
bargain in good faith.
The company has lost 11 court ap
peals on the NLRB rulings, according
to the; Times. As a result, it has doled
out $1.3 million in back pay and has
paid the union $50,000 in an out-of
court settlement for a 1974 charge of
bugging union organizers' motel
rooms in South Carolina, the Times
reported.
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance here, said he
received a proxy ballot for the
shareholder's meeting last week.
However, he said he does not i nfend to
refer this one to the Presidential Com
mission on Investment Responsibility
IC-IR).
The C-IR is composed of faculty,
students and alumni who consider
such matters as proxy votes for Uni

versity investments, said Augsburger.
"We could simply not have the
proxy voted on at all," Augsburger
said. He explained that Stevens was a
"minor account over which we have
no control.
'Holding company'
"The donor gave the funds to us. We
are acting like their holding company.

have not made significant progress,
stated the ACTWU.
"The company rejects all proposals

for voluntary check-off of union dues
because that would permit the union
to develop the financial support
needed to sustain itself," stated an
ACTWIJ press release.
Rejected all proposals
The union also claimed that the
company rejected all proposals for
grievance arbitration.
"These two items are negotiable,"
according to Stevens' Industrial Rela
tions Manager Paul Barrett, contacted
in South Carolina yesterday.
"It is understood that anything on
the contract has to be agreed upon by
both parties. These two matters (vol
untary check-off and grievance arbitra
tion) are not in the best interests of the
company," he said.
According to the Interfaith Center
on Corporate Responsibility proxy, the
Fifth Circuit Court has found the com
pany in contempt because of its refusal
to bargain in good faith.
The Interfaith Center is comprised of
the World Division, Board of Clobal
Ministries of the United Methodist
Church; the Franciscan Justice' and
Peace Office of Washington, D.C.; the

Institute of Christian Doctrine; Fran
ciscan Missionaries of Mary and the
Catholic Foreign Mission Society of
America, Inc. (the Maryknoll Fathers).
The coalition stated that its resolu
tion, if approved by a majority of the
shareholders would provide
shareholders with "factual and accu
rate data" on labor practices so
shareholders would be "able to assess
the potential financial impact ot prot
racted conflict with the unionization
effort."
Stevens' Barrett said three of the 15
NLRB violation rulings were over
turned by the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals. The number of guilty rulings
"is insignificant over a 1A year
period," Barrett said.
The Interfaith Center proxy said the
15 cases in which the company was
found guilty by the NLRB have "meant
needless legal and administrative ex
penses and adverse publicity."
Barrett said the threatened nation
wide boycott of Stevens products has
not affected sales so far.
"The only thing we know about it
(boycott) is what we read in the pap
ers," he said.
In the event of a boycott, Barrett said
Stevens "plans to take all legal steps"
to stop any illegal activities under the
boycott.
An attempt last night to organize
support here for a national boycott of
certain sheets, pillowcases and carpets
attracted only a handful of persons to
Roble Hall's Blue Lounge.
About 15 persons came to the meet
ing to discuss a boycott of J.P. Stevens
& Co.. the nation's second largest tex
tile manufacturer.
Peter Necarsulmer, a meeting or
ganizer. said the group will also en
courage the University, which is a
shareholder in Stevens, to vote in favor
of two resolutions at a Stevens
shareholder's meeting March 1 in New
York City.
The resolutions call for a disclosure
of company compliance with equal
employment opportunity and affirma
tive action laws and a written descrip
tion of company labor policies and
practices. They were written by a coal
ition of five religious groups which
holds 42,618 shares of Stevens stock.
Stevens is "regarded by the union
(Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union - ACTWU) as the most
relentlessly anti-union company in a
generally anti-union industry," the
New York Times reported last Dec. 18.
The company has also been found
guilty by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) in 15 cases of illegally
discharging workers or refusing to
bargain in good faith.
The company has lost 11 court ap
peals on the NLRB rulings, according
to the; Times. As a result, it has doled
out $1.3 million in back pay and has
paid the union $50,000 in an out-of
court settlement for a 1974 charge of
bugging union organizers' motel
rooms in South Carolina, the Times
reported.
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance here, said he
received a proxy ballot for the
shareholder's meeting last week.
However, he said he does not i nfend to
refer this one to the Presidential Com
mission on Investment Responsibility
IC-IR).
The C-IR is composed of faculty,
students and alumni who consider
such matters as proxy votes for Uni

versity investments, said Augsburger.
"We could simply not have the
proxy voted on at all," Augsburger
said. He explained that Stevens was a
"minor account over which we have
no control.
'Holding company'
"The donor gave the funds to us. We
are acting like their holding company.
We received about 3000 shares. Usu
ally, in investments, the University
holds 50.000 to 100,000 shares," Au
gsburger said.
Harry Turner, assistant director of
finance, confirmed that the University
had an "extremely minor holding" of
3000 shares. On Wednesday the price
per share closed at 19Vb.
"These shares are held in trust by us
for the benefit of the donors as long as
they live. All dividends are paid to the
beneficiaries. After they (the be
neficiaries) die, only then do they (the
dividends) come to Stanford. But we
do vote the proxy," Turner said.
"I do know we nearly always vote a
proxy," said Turner. "We will take ex
ception with management occasion
ally." He added that the bulk of Uni
versity assets are invested in sums of
half a million dollars or more.
'Critical areas'
Augsburger said he had discussed
not referring this proxy to the C-IR
with Director of Finance Rodney
Adams. He said that while the com
mission does consider issues such as
investments in corporations which
have factories in South Africa and "a
few other critical areas," the Univer
sity prefers to "concentrate where we
can address issues with the most im
pact," mainly where the University
has larger share holdings.
"We have to channel our energies to
those (issues) that have more impact
on us and relevance; to those issues
more under the policy guidelines ot
the University," Adams said.
"We've been asked to take positions
ranging all over the map to show 'our
concern,' "continued Adams. "It's not
all that simple to do. What is right?
What is wrong?
"That's not to say that some of the
issues are not worthv of arguing for

and supporting. The unfortunate thing
with these proxy issues is that there is
not enough time to have them go
through a sequence of analytical
steps," he said.
Multinational
Stevens is a multinational corpora
tion with 63 of its 85 U.S. plants lo
cated in North and South Carolina.
The company realized net sales of
$1.42 billion dollars and net income
after taxes of $41 million in 1976, ac
cording to its 1976 annual report.

None of its 44,000 employes are co
vered by a union contract, according to
ACTWU. Only seven Stevens plants,
all located in Roanoke Rapids, N.C.,
have held successful National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) elections for
union representation.
However, contract negotiations at
Roanoke Rapids, ordered by the Sec

Peter Necarsulmer, a meeting or
ganizer. said the group will also en
courage the University, which is a
shareholder in Stevens, to vote in favor
of two resolutions at a Stevens
shareholder's meeting March 1 in New
York City.
The resolutions call for a disclosure
of company compliance with equal
employment opportunity and affirma
tive action laws and a written descrip
tion of company labor policies and
practices. They were written by a coal
ition of five religious groups which
holds 42,618 shares of Stevens stock.
Stevens is "regarded by the union
(Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union - ACTWU) as the most
relentlessly anti-union company in a
generally anti-union industry," the
New York Times reported last Dec. 18.
The company has also been found
guilty by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) in 15 cases of illegally
discharging workers or refusing to
bargain in good faith.
The company has lost 11 court ap
peals on the NLRB rulings, according
to the; Times. As a result, it has doled
out $1.3 million in back pay and has
paid the union $50,000 in an out-of
court settlement for a 1974 charge of
bugging union organizers' motel
rooms in South Carolina, the Times
reported.
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance here, said he
received a proxy ballot for the
shareholder's meeting last week.
However, he said he does not i nfend to
refer this one to the Presidential Com
mission on Investment Responsibility
IC-IR).
The C-IR is composed of faculty,
students and alumni who consider
such matters as proxy votes for Uni

versity investments, said Augsburger.
"We could simply not have the
proxy voted on at all," Augsburger
said. He explained that Stevens was a
"minor account over which we have
no control.
'Holding company'
"The donor gave the funds to us. We
are acting like their holding company.
We received about 3000 shares. Usu
ally, in investments, the University
holds 50.000 to 100,000 shares," Au
gsburger said.
Harry Turner, assistant director of
finance, confirmed that the University
had an "extremely minor holding" of
3000 shares. On Wednesday the price
per share closed at 19Vb.
"These shares are held in trust by us
for the benefit of the donors as long as
they live. All dividends are paid to the
beneficiaries. After they (the be
neficiaries) die, only then do they (the
dividends) come to Stanford. But we
do vote the proxy," Turner said.
"I do know we nearly always vote a
proxy," said Turner. "We will take ex
ception with management occasion
ally." He added that the bulk of Uni
versity assets are invested in sums of
half a million dollars or more.
'Critical areas'
Augsburger said he had discussed
not referring this proxy to the C-IR
with Director of Finance Rodney
Adams. He said that while the com
mission does consider issues such as
investments in corporations which
have factories in South Africa and "a
few other critical areas," the Univer
sity prefers to "concentrate where we
can address issues with the most im
pact," mainly where the University
has larger share holdings.
"We have to channel our energies to
those (issues) that have more impact
on us and relevance; to those issues
more under the policy guidelines ot
the University," Adams said.
"We've been asked to take positions
ranging all over the map to show 'our
concern,' "continued Adams. "It's not
all that simple to do. What is right?
What is wrong?
"That's not to say that some of the
issues are not worthv of arguing for

and supporting. The unfortunate thing
with these proxy issues is that there is
not enough time to have them go
through a sequence of analytical
steps," he said.
Multinational
Stevens is a multinational corpora
tion with 63 of its 85 U.S. plants lo
cated in North and South Carolina.
The company realized net sales of
$1.42 billion dollars and net income
after taxes of $41 million in 1976, ac
cording to its 1976 annual report.

None of its 44,000 employes are co
vered by a union contract, according to
ACTWU. Only seven Stevens plants,
all located in Roanoke Rapids, N.C.,
have held successful National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) elections for
union representation.
However, contract negotiations at
Roanoke Rapids, ordered by the Sec
ond Circuit Court of Appeals in 1974,
have not made significant progress,
stated the ACTWU.
"The company rejects all proposals

for voluntary check-off of union dues
because that would permit the union
to develop the financial support
needed to sustain itself," stated an
ACTWIJ press release.
Rejected all proposals
The union also claimed that the
company rejected all proposals for
grievance arbitration.
"These two items are negotiable,"
according to Stevens' Industrial Rela
tions Manager Paul Barrett, contacted
in South Carolina yesterday.
"It is understood that anything on
the contract has to be agreed upon by
both parties. These two matters (vol
untary check-off and grievance arbitra
tion) are not in the best interests of the
company," he said.
According to the Interfaith Center
on Corporate Responsibility proxy, the
Fifth Circuit Court has found the com
pany in contempt because of its refusal
to bargain in good faith.
The Interfaith Center is comprised of
the World Division, Board of Clobal
Ministries of the United Methodist
Church; the Franciscan Justice' and
Peace Office of Washington, D.C.; the

Institute of Christian Doctrine; Fran
ciscan Missionaries of Mary and the
Catholic Foreign Mission Society of
America, Inc. (the Maryknoll Fathers).
The coalition stated that its resolu
tion, if approved by a majority of the
shareholders would provide
shareholders with "factual and accu
rate data" on labor practices so
shareholders would be "able to assess
the potential financial impact ot prot
racted conflict with the unionization
effort."
Stevens' Barrett said three of the 15
NLRB violation rulings were over
turned by the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals. The number of guilty rulings
"is insignificant over a 1A year
period," Barrett said.
The Interfaith Center proxy said the
15 cases in which the company was
found guilty by the NLRB have "meant
needless legal and administrative ex
penses and adverse publicity."
Barrett said the threatened nation
wide boycott of Stevens products has
not affected sales so far.
"The only thing we know about it
(boycott) is what we read in the pap
ers," he said.
In the event of a boycott, Barrett said
Stevens "plans to take all legal steps"
to stop any illegal activities under the
boycott.
