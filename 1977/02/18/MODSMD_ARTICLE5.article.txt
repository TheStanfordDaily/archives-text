Speeches by a U.S. senator, a con
gressman and various professors and
guest lecturers. Films and panel dis
cussions. A poetry recital. All this and
more make February Black Liberation
Month at Stanford.
Black Liberation Month was started
three years ago by the Black Student
Union (BSU) here as an expansion of
Black History Week (sponsored by the
nationwide Association for Negro Life
an i History) according to Alma Robin
sun, coordinator for the Afro-
American Studies Program.
The BSU has organized a series of
programs for February focusing on the
black liberation movements in south
ern Africa.
So far, the series has included films
and lectures on the background of the
present political situation in South Af
rica, and the effect of labor policies and
economic developments on politics in
southern Africa, Robinson said.
The Black Activities Center, the
Dickenson Symposium Fund, and the
African and Afro-American Studies
Program have jointly sponsored this
series, she added.
Speakers for the program have in
cluded Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, Aguibou Yansane of the
Afro-American Studies Department at
UC-Berkeley, and Sociology Prof.
Harrv Kdwards of UC-Berkelev.

U.S. Sen. Dick Clark (D-Iowa) and
Rep. Charles Diggs (D-Mich.) will be
here to speak on U.S. foreign policy
concerning southern Africa on Feb. 25
and 27 respectively.
Clark will speak on U.S. policy op
tions and Diggs will discuss the role of
the Congressional Black Caucus.
Tuesday night, David Sibeko, the
U.N. observer for the Pan-Africanist
Congress of Azania (the Black Libera
tion name for South Africa), gave a lec
ture on the prospects for Southern Af
rica.
Sibeko recently addressed the U.N.
General Assembly in an effort to pro
mote resolutions condemning South
Africa, reported Robinson.
He is the first black South African
representing a liberation group who
has been allowed to speak on the floor
of the General Assembly, she said.
Sibeko labeled his chance to partici
pate directly in the General Assembly
as an "unprecedented and unique
achievement."
While the Pan-Africanist Congress
welcomes and encourages foreign
support for its cause, he said, it realizes
this help is "peripheral and com
plementary to the main struggle which
we Azanians must achieve for ourse
lves."
