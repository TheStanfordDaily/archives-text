# Stanford Daily Opinions
## Living for social change 
### 
Thorn et al.

Beyond being a nice place to live, Columbae's themes of
non-violence and social change are embodied in our daily
existence, allowing our community to act both as a model
tor future living groups and as an active center for political
and social change in the present.
Within our community, we express our theme through
our awareness of our personal political and social roles in
society and through our respect for the finiteness of the
Earth upon which the whole human community depends.
Specifically, we are aware of the food we consume, of its
nutritional value and of the social implications of our con
sumption. We buy organically farmed, unprocessed grains,
and bonita instead of the tuna normally harvested through a
process that kills porpoises.
As virtual vegetarians, we eat low on the food chain, for
reasons which include a desire to minimize our consump
tion ot the worlds resources, a respect for higher animal life
and a need for good nutrition. We use our food wastes
through garden compost and constantly recycle paper,
glass, cardboard and metal.
Clothesline
Energy is conserved through turning off the heater at
night and using a clothesline to dry ourclothes (check it out
some sunny day from theLaw School lawn). Through our
effort to lower our lood and energy consumption to corres
pond to the limitation of the world's resources, we believe
that our community provides an example of a way to make
the changes in lifestyle which are becoming increasingly
necessary for our survival as a society. .
Our theme of social change is expressed by the unique
roleColumbae plays in the community, through its support
ot political activities which offer different perspectives in
social thought, and which identify and work to correct
existing social and political problems.
This support of social change begins within the house,
where members of Columbae community can actively share
their political ideasand ideologies, and bring their political
projects for help and support from the community. We
maintain a good library of books, magazines and newspap
ers concerned with alternative political, spiritual and
psychological themes.

Furthermore, we give harbor to and foster a variety of
groups interested in various aspects of social change, by
making rooms available for them to meet in, by providing
volunteers to work with them and by giving them direct
monetary support.
So far this year, Columbae has been the base for the
Trident Concern group, the Stanford Coalition Against the
B-l Bomber and the Stanford Community Coordinating
Center for the David Harris Campaign. We gave money to
the I'alo Alto Women's Self Help Center, the Stanford
Hunger Committee and the Farmworkers "Yes-on-14"
Campaign and fostered the Androgyny Theme House.
Classes meet here regularly to discuss sexism, political
organizing, communal living and holistic health, and we
are the historical and current base for the Alliance for Radi
cal Change (ARC), Against the Grain and the Radical Film
Series Croup.
Living theme
Currently, the University is considering eliminating Col
umbae, based on the surmise that we lack a relevant theme
and that our function in the University will be replaced by
the Androgyny theme house. But, far from being an ar
chaic remnant of the '60s, Columbae is actively living its
theme of non-violence and social change as it relates to
current, vital political issues.
In doing so, we are performing the vital role of nurturing
social change and criticism within an otherwise static and
generally apathetic university. The diversity and externally
directed, active nature of this theme clearly differentiates
Columbae from the new Androgyny theme house, whose
focus rests upon a specific, though pervasive set of social
problems.
We compliment the University on fostering such a politi
cally and socially unique house as Columbae, a house
which can serve both as a model for alternative personal
and political lifestyles and as a center for social change.
And finally, we sincerely invite anyone interested to come
to our open house, which will be announced in "Once
Around the Quad," and experience Columbae for them
selves.

Clothesline
Energy is conserved through turning off the heater at
night and using a clothesline to dry ourclothes (check it out
some sunny day from theLaw School lawn). Through our
effort to lower our lood and energy consumption to corres
pond to the limitation of the world's resources, we believe
that our community provides an example of a way to make
the changes in lifestyle which are becoming increasingly
necessary for our survival as a society. .
Our theme of social change is expressed by the unique
roleColumbae plays in the community, through its support
ot political activities which offer different perspectives in
social thought, and which identify and work to correct
existing social and political problems.
This support of social change begins within the house,
where members of Columbae community can actively share
their political ideasand ideologies, and bring their political
projects for help and support from the community. We
maintain a good library of books, magazines and newspap
ers concerned with alternative political, spiritual and
psychological themes.

Furthermore, we give harbor to and foster a variety of
groups interested in various aspects of social change, by
making rooms available for them to meet in, by providing
volunteers to work with them and by giving them direct
monetary support.
So far this year, Columbae has been the base for the
Trident Concern group, the Stanford Coalition Against the
B-l Bomber and the Stanford Community Coordinating
Center for the David Harris Campaign. We gave money to
the I'alo Alto Women's Self Help Center, the Stanford
Hunger Committee and the Farmworkers "Yes-on-14"
Campaign and fostered the Androgyny Theme House.
Classes meet here regularly to discuss sexism, political
organizing, communal living and holistic health, and we
are the historical and current base for the Alliance for Radi
cal Change (ARC), Against the Grain and the Radical Film
Series Croup.
Living theme
Currently, the University is considering eliminating Col
umbae, based on the surmise that we lack a relevant theme
and that our function in the University will be replaced by
the Androgyny theme house. But, far from being an ar
chaic remnant of the '60s, Columbae is actively living its
theme of non-violence and social change as it relates to
current, vital political issues.
In doing so, we are performing the vital role of nurturing
social change and criticism within an otherwise static and
generally apathetic university. The diversity and externally
directed, active nature of this theme clearly differentiates
Columbae from the new Androgyny theme house, whose
focus rests upon a specific, though pervasive set of social
problems.
We compliment the University on fostering such a politi
cally and socially unique house as Columbae, a house
which can serve both as a model for alternative personal
and political lifestyles and as a center for social change.
And finally, we sincerely invite anyone interested to come
to our open house, which will be announced in "Once
Around the Quad," and experience Columbae for them
selves.

Beyond being a nice place to live, Columbae's themes of
non-violence and social change are embodied in our daily
existence, allowing our community to act both as a model
tor future living groups and as an active center for political
and social change in the present.
Within our community, we express our theme through
our awareness of our personal political and social roles in
society and through our respect for the finiteness of the
Earth upon which the whole human community depends.
Specifically, we are aware of the food we consume, of its
nutritional value and of the social implications of our con
sumption. We buy organically farmed, unprocessed grains,
and bonita instead of the tuna normally harvested through a
process that kills porpoises.
As virtual vegetarians, we eat low on the food chain, for
reasons which include a desire to minimize our consump
tion ot the worlds resources, a respect for higher animal life
and a need for good nutrition. We use our food wastes
through garden compost and constantly recycle paper,
glass, cardboard and metal.
