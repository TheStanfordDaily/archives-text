# For love of money

Miller, Kelemen

What bothered us yesterday slips
rTVvay today The urgent of one day be
comes the forgotten of the next.
Nevertheless, some events require
more than a casual reflection. There
are the events that tear at the soul and
till one with sadness and indignation.
These are events with names im
printed upon our minds: Tokyo Rose.
Biafra. Adolf Eichman. Abu Daoud.
Abu Daoud. accused mastermind of
the Munich Olympic massacre, should
have stood trial last month in France.
But Daoud will never stand trial. In a
cold political move. France, bowing to
the pressure of Arab oil and money,
freed this terrorist.
"Why was he allowed to leave Paris
in the comfort of a first class airline
seat, when 11 Israeli athletes left
Munich in coffins?" This is the ques
tion Eli Weisel asks for all of us.
Weisel. a veteran of the Nazi con
centration camps, has been called the
"conscience of post-war Europe." On
Jan. 20.1977, he wrote in an open letter
to President Giscard d'Estaing of Fr
ance:
Liberated from Buchenwald. it
was in France that I found compas
sion and humanitv. It was in France

that I found generosity and friend
ship. It was in France that I disco
vered the other side, the brighter
side, of mankind. . . .
France, to me, represented hu
manity's highest values in a sterile
and cynical society. It evoked Rous
seau and Bergson, Proust and Zola.
Camus and Mauriac. It symbolized
an inspiring quest for justice and
brotherhood. In France, I thought,
the word humanism does not make
people laugh. . . .
What has become of France?
It has betrayed its own traditions.
France has become as cynical as
the rest of the world.
Why did your government free
Abu Daoud?
And why so hastily?
He lied under oath about his false
identity.
Why wasn't he held until Ger
many or Israel could offer evidence
of his crime?
In my country we believe that
France quite simply, and quite
shockingly, yielded to killer's
blackmail, oil merchants' bribery,
and the chance to sell some fighter
planes. And in doing that, France

deliberately humiliated the vic
tims' widows and orphans, and in
sulted the memory of their
dead. . . .
But then, in truth, one should
have expected nothing else from
France today. In recent years the
signs have multiplied.
Offensive statements. Sneering
remarks. Sudden policy reversals.
Strange alliances. Broken promises.
One-sided embargoes. The Cher
bourg affair. The Mirage sale.
French governments have rarely
missed an opportunity to de
monstrate their hostility to Israel
and the Jewish people.
France even abstained on the in
famous resolution equating
Zionism and racism.
For ideological reasons?
Much worse: purely for money.
Yes, Mr. President, I used to be
proud of France and what it stood
for.
I no longer am
Abu Daoud. France. Names we will
not forget. May our memory of such
injustices bother us forever.

remarks. Sudden policy reversals.
Strange alliances. Broken promises.
One-sided embargoes. The Cher
bourg affair. The Mirage sale.
French governments have rarely
missed an opportunity to de
monstrate their hostility to Israel
and the Jewish people.
France even abstained on the in
famous resolution equating
Zionism and racism.
For ideological reasons?
Much worse: purely for money.
Yes, Mr. President, I used to be
proud of France and what it stood
for.
I no longer am
Abu Daoud. France. Names we will
not forget. May our memory of such
injustices bother us forever.

Miller, Kelemen

What bothered us yesterday slips
rTVvay today The urgent of one day be
comes the forgotten of the next.
Nevertheless, some events require
more than a casual reflection. There
are the events that tear at the soul and
till one with sadness and indignation.
These are events with names im
printed upon our minds: Tokyo Rose.
Biafra. Adolf Eichman. Abu Daoud.
Abu Daoud. accused mastermind of
the Munich Olympic massacre, should
have stood trial last month in France.
But Daoud will never stand trial. In a
cold political move. France, bowing to
the pressure of Arab oil and money,
freed this terrorist.
"Why was he allowed to leave Paris
in the comfort of a first class airline
seat, when 11 Israeli athletes left
Munich in coffins?" This is the ques
tion Eli Weisel asks for all of us.
Weisel. a veteran of the Nazi con
centration camps, has been called the
"conscience of post-war Europe." On
Jan. 20.1977, he wrote in an open letter
to President Giscard d'Estaing of Fr
ance:
Liberated from Buchenwald. it
was in France that I found compas
sion and humanitv. It was in France

that I found generosity and friend
ship. It was in France that I disco
vered the other side, the brighter
side, of mankind. . . .
France, to me, represented hu
manity's highest values in a sterile
and cynical society. It evoked Rous
seau and Bergson, Proust and Zola.
Camus and Mauriac. It symbolized
an inspiring quest for justice and
brotherhood. In France, I thought,
the word humanism does not make
people laugh. . . .
What has become of France?
It has betrayed its own traditions.
France has become as cynical as
the rest of the world.
Why did your government free
Abu Daoud?
And why so hastily?
He lied under oath about his false
identity.
Why wasn't he held until Ger
many or Israel could offer evidence
of his crime?
In my country we believe that
France quite simply, and quite
shockingly, yielded to killer's
blackmail, oil merchants' bribery,
and the chance to sell some fighter
planes. And in doing that, France

deliberately humiliated the vic
tims' widows and orphans, and in
sulted the memory of their
dead. . . .
But then, in truth, one should
have expected nothing else from
France today. In recent years the
signs have multiplied.
Offensive statements. Sneering
remarks. Sudden policy reversals.
Strange alliances. Broken promises.
One-sided embargoes. The Cher
bourg affair. The Mirage sale.
