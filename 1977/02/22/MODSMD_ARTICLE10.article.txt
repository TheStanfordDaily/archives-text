## Opinions Viewpoint Roth will be missed 
### 
Joe Roth, UC-Berkeley's star quarterback, has
died but it is not only football fans who will miss
him. Roth died Saturday of malignant
melanoma, a form of cancer which has been
plaguing the quarterback for three years.
The senior rushed and passed 3769 yards in
his two years at Cal, winning acclaim as the
Bears' best quarterback ever. He would have un
doubtedly been chosen in the first round of the
upcoming professional football draft.
But what Roth accomplished in his personal

life is far more important than what he did on the
grid. Many of us let troubles dominate our lives.
We wallow in the depression that accrues from
pending finals and painful heartaches. Cancer
had burrowed itself in Roth's body yet he man
aged to free himself from thoughts of death
enough to lead an active life. Not all of us can be
football heroes. We can assimilate our 21-year
old peer's appreciation for life, however.
