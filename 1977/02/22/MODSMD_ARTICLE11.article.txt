# Labor justice urged

### 
Strand, Vettel

Within 24 hours of its inception, the
Stanford Committee for Justice at J.P.
Stevens amassed over 500 faculty, stu
dent and staff signatures on a petition
urging the University to assume its
moral obligation by voting in favor of
two resolutions submitted by the Inter
faith Center on Corporate Responsibil
ity (ICCR) to the Mar. 1 meeting of J.P.
Stevens shareholders.
Friday afternoon the committee pre
sented the petition toßobert Augs
burger, vice-president for business
and finance, and Rodney Adams, di
rector of finance.
As a result of the committee's pres
sure and in view of the strong com
munity sentiment reflected by the peti
tion, Augsburger and Adams reversed
their earlier decision to abstain from
voting on the proxy. They decided to
support the first ICCR resolution di
recting J.P. Stevens management to
publish information about the place
ment of minorities, including blacks,
chicanos, and women, in its work
force. Augsburger and Adams
abstained from voting on the second
resolution, awaiting the recommenda
tion of the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (C —IR).
Today, committee members Harold
Boyd, associate dean of students: Anne
Schlagenhaft, United Stanford
Employee's president Charles Drek
meier, political science professor, and
undergraduates Peter Necarsulmer
and Steve Vettel will meet with the
C—IR to urge it to recommend in favor
of the second ICCR resolution, calling

for publication of similar labor
policies and practices.
J.P. Stevens, the world's second
largest textile manufacturer, has the
worst labor-law record of any major
American corporation. Since 1965, the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has found J.P. Stevens guilty of
15 cases of "unfair" labor practices,
most involving company interference
with workers' organizing efforts for
improved wages and working un
ionized industries, a six-day work
week, and well-documented discrimi
nation against women and blacks. For
example, biacks make up 20 percent of
Stevens' employes, but hold only 3 per
cent of the white-collar jobs.
This is just part of J.P. Stevens' un
paralleled record of labor-law viola
tions and exploitation:
—The company paid $500,000 in
back taxes for the period of 1952-1974.
The company avoided paying taxes on
$75 million of property in 22 of 26
North Carolina counties.
—The company paid the U.S. Gov
ernment $260,000 as a settlement in a
damage suit filed against the company
and five other manufacturers of glass
fiber fabric for price fixing and over
charging several Federal agencies.
—In a Watergate-type case involv
ing wiretapping of union organizers'
motel rooms, the company decided not
to defend itself and paid $50,000 to
settle a damage suit.
—Department of Labor inspectors
have found that dust levels in Stevens
plants are three times the maximum

allowed under the Occupational
Safety and Health Act. As a result,
thousands of workers suffer from crip
pling "brown lung" disease.
These are but a few of the policies
and practices that led Boyd Leedom, a
former NLRB chairman, to declare,
"J.P. Stevens is so out of touch with a
humane, civilized approach to indust
rial relations that it would shock even
those least sensitive to honor, justice
and decent treatment."
The University's state proxy voting
policy instructs it to vote in favor of
full disclosure of employe-related
data. The University also has placed
itself in a position of upholding the
law and as a moral leader in guaran
teeing equal justice for all Americans.
On moral and legal considerations
alone, the Stanford Committee for Jus
ticeat J.P. Stevens believes theUniver
sity should cast its 3000 share proxy in
favor of the ICCR resolutions.
The purpose of the national con
sumer boycott is not to destroy J.P.
Stevens but to impress upon it that
American consumers will no longer
•subsidize its anti-social, illegal ac
tivities by buying its products.
To demonstrate to the University
community concern and support for
the ICCR resolutions, we appeal to all
faculty, students, and staff members to
sign the letters and petitions calling
for Stanford to abide by its moral and
legal obligations.

dent and staff signatures on a petition
urging the University to assume its
moral obligation by voting in favor of
two resolutions submitted by the Inter
faith Center on Corporate Responsibil
ity (ICCR) to the Mar. 1 meeting of J.P.
Stevens shareholders.
Friday afternoon the committee pre
sented the petition toßobert Augs
burger, vice-president for business
and finance, and Rodney Adams, di
rector of finance.
As a result of the committee's pres
sure and in view of the strong com
munity sentiment reflected by the peti
tion, Augsburger and Adams reversed
their earlier decision to abstain from
voting on the proxy. They decided to
support the first ICCR resolution di
recting J.P. Stevens management to
publish information about the place
ment of minorities, including blacks,
chicanos, and women, in its work
force. Augsburger and Adams
abstained from voting on the second
resolution, awaiting the recommenda
tion of the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (C —IR).
Today, committee members Harold
Boyd, associate dean of students: Anne
Schlagenhaft, United Stanford
Employee's president Charles Drek
meier, political science professor, and
undergraduates Peter Necarsulmer
and Steve Vettel will meet with the
C—IR to urge it to recommend in favor
of the second ICCR resolution, calling

for publication of similar labor
policies and practices.
J.P. Stevens, the world's second
largest textile manufacturer, has the
worst labor-law record of any major
American corporation. Since 1965, the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has found J.P. Stevens guilty of
15 cases of "unfair" labor practices,
most involving company interference
with workers' organizing efforts for
improved wages and working un
ionized industries, a six-day work
week, and well-documented discrimi
nation against women and blacks. For
example, biacks make up 20 percent of
Stevens' employes, but hold only 3 per
cent of the white-collar jobs.
This is just part of J.P. Stevens' un
paralleled record of labor-law viola
tions and exploitation:
—The company paid $500,000 in
back taxes for the period of 1952-1974.
The company avoided paying taxes on
$75 million of property in 22 of 26
North Carolina counties.
—The company paid the U.S. Gov
ernment $260,000 as a settlement in a
damage suit filed against the company
and five other manufacturers of glass
fiber fabric for price fixing and over
charging several Federal agencies.
—In a Watergate-type case involv
ing wiretapping of union organizers'
motel rooms, the company decided not
to defend itself and paid $50,000 to
settle a damage suit.
—Department of Labor inspectors
have found that dust levels in Stevens
plants are three times the maximum

allowed under the Occupational
Safety and Health Act. As a result,
thousands of workers suffer from crip
pling "brown lung" disease.
These are but a few of the policies
and practices that led Boyd Leedom, a
former NLRB chairman, to declare,
"J.P. Stevens is so out of touch with a
humane, civilized approach to indust
rial relations that it would shock even
those least sensitive to honor, justice
and decent treatment."
The University's state proxy voting
policy instructs it to vote in favor of
full disclosure of employe-related
data. The University also has placed
itself in a position of upholding the
law and as a moral leader in guaran
teeing equal justice for all Americans.
On moral and legal considerations
alone, the Stanford Committee for Jus
ticeat J.P. Stevens believes theUniver
sity should cast its 3000 share proxy in
favor of the ICCR resolutions.
The purpose of the national con
sumer boycott is not to destroy J.P.
Stevens but to impress upon it that
American consumers will no longer
•subsidize its anti-social, illegal ac
tivities by buying its products.
To demonstrate to the University
community concern and support for
the ICCR resolutions, we appeal to all
faculty, students, and staff members to
sign the letters and petitions calling
for Stanford to abide by its moral and
legal obligations.
