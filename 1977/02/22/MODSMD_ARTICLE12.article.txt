Abortion
In his editorial of Feb. 16, Doug
Bandow quotes California Medicine
as saying "everyone knows" that
"human life begins at conception." As
a matter of fact, this is not a widely
held position in modern biology.
Speaking at a pro-abortion rally i n San
Jose last Sept. 19, Dr. Paul Ehrlich ar
gued that life is a continuum, and that
a sperm, an egg, a fetus, and the crowd
at the rally were equally regardable as
human life in a sense. "You can define
a person legally anywhere the legal
system wants to define it," said
Ehrlich. "but as far as the biology is
concerned there is no point where you
can say there is or isn't a human life or
is or isn't a person."
Bandow further asserts that argu
ment in favor of legalizing abortion to
avoid abortions performed by "back
room hacks . . . dodges the moral

issue altogether." Rather, it seems to
me that such argument recognizes the
inevitability of abortions in present
day society, and attempts to deal with
that fact through legislation.
Bandow claims that the "fundamen
tal issue" is "conscience versus life."
This may be the fundamental issue ac
cording to his own ethical code, but in
practical terms the fundamental issue
is plainly legal safe abortion versus il
legal unsafe abortion, for anti-abortion
legislation is unenforceable.
Lastly, Bandow completely over
looks the social and economic dis
parities of illegalizing abortion. Such
an amendment would merely push
abortion underground, where the rich
could find competent help and the
poor could not. Rando|ph Bufano

I would like to comment (nega

tively) on the current debate turning
on whether to convert some of five re
sidences including ATO into theme
houses.
It would seem basic, even
minimal common sense that if for
reasons best know to themselves,
COSS/R is determined to establish
theme houses in place of existing resi
dences, they would choose living ar
rangements that have rather clearly
shown themselves to be less success
ful.
Specifically one wonders why ATO,
which has consistently proven strong
in the housing draw, and desirable in
the opinion of its residents, is being
considered alongside other houses
such as Jordan which cannot even at
tract sufficient people to reach its
capacity.
