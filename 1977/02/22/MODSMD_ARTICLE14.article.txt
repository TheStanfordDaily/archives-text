# Congressional raise undeserved
## 
### 
Don Barton

The congressional pay hike which
went into effect last week is particu
larly disturbing, not only because
Congress doesn't deserve it, but more
importantly because it strikes at the
very heart and soul of the concept of
representative democracy upon which
this country was founded.
Last Wednesday House Republican
leader John Rhodes of Arizona intro
duced a motion to bring to the fore a
resolution to stop the proposed 29 per
cent raise. The resolution never
reached a vote, blocked by an objection
from Charles Wilson (D-Tex.). Thus,
the congressional pay raise went into
effect because the House Post Office
and Civil Service Subcommittee
which handled it did not report the
resolution which would have required
a roll call vote by the full House. In
effect, Congressmen and Senators got a
raise they never voted on.
On the surface, the idea of a raise at
all — not to mention a raise of such
large dimension — is totally ridicul
ous and highly irresponsible. In a free
market economy like ours, people get
salary raises for doing a good job and
doing it efficiently. The recently
adjourned 95th Congress was one of
the most inept legislative groups of
this century, refusing to cooperate
with ex-President Ford and biding
time until the November 1976 elec
tions.
Major issues such as defense, the
Middle East, Turkey, and, most impor
tantly, the establishment of an energy
policy were things the Congress re
fused to act on, letting the welfare and
prosperity of the nation sour in the
wake of a recovery from the 1974 re
cession. Clearly, the Congress does not
deserve a raise at all — and a rise of 29
per cent is beyond intelligent com
prehension.
The most disturbing point, however,
is the spirit with which this raise will
be made into law. In a democracy such
as ours, representatives are elected by
the people to vote in Washington; they
are to represent the people who elected

them and vote for those people. This
idea has been usurped to the fullest by
the Democratic majority in the House.
What they have done is an act of de
spotism, for they have denied congres
sional members the opportunity to
represent the people while, at the same
time, abusing their own responsibility
to act on the will of the people of their
own district. Once again, the
Democratically-controlled Congress is
trying to slip this one under the rug
and take advantage of the American
taxpayer. Rhodes recognized this, say
ing, "We have to have greater respect
for the intelligence of the American
people than to believe that they will
not see through this charade . . . we
must face up to our responsibility and
have a recorded vote." The Democrats
in the House subcommittee ignored

that responsibility, thinking first of
their own pockets and second of the
people they claim to represent.
In 1858, ina speech in Edwardsville,
111., Abraham Lincoln said, "Our re
liance is in the love of liberty which
God has planted in us. Our defense is
in the spirit which prizes liberty as the
heritage of all men, in all lands
everywhere. Destroy this spirit and
you have planted the seeds of de
spotism at your own doors." The
Democrats in the House of Representa
tives, by refusing to go on record with a
roll call vote on the issue of a pay raise,
have lost the spirit of representative
democracy. Liberty, for them, is not
"the heritage of all men."

representative democracy upon which
this country was founded.
Last Wednesday House Republican
leader John Rhodes of Arizona intro
duced a motion to bring to the fore a
resolution to stop the proposed 29 per
cent raise. The resolution never
reached a vote, blocked by an objection
from Charles Wilson (D-Tex.). Thus,
the congressional pay raise went into
effect because the House Post Office
and Civil Service Subcommittee
which handled it did not report the
resolution which would have required
a roll call vote by the full House. In
effect, Congressmen and Senators got a
raise they never voted on.
On the surface, the idea of a raise at
all — not to mention a raise of such
large dimension — is totally ridicul
ous and highly irresponsible. In a free
market economy like ours, people get
salary raises for doing a good job and
doing it efficiently. The recently
adjourned 95th Congress was one of
the most inept legislative groups of
this century, refusing to cooperate
with ex-President Ford and biding
time until the November 1976 elec
tions.
Major issues such as defense, the
Middle East, Turkey, and, most impor
tantly, the establishment of an energy
policy were things the Congress re
fused to act on, letting the welfare and
prosperity of the nation sour in the
wake of a recovery from the 1974 re
cession. Clearly, the Congress does not
deserve a raise at all — and a rise of 29
per cent is beyond intelligent com
prehension.
The most disturbing point, however,
is the spirit with which this raise will
be made into law. In a democracy such
as ours, representatives are elected by
the people to vote in Washington; they
are to represent the people who elected

them and vote for those people. This
idea has been usurped to the fullest by
the Democratic majority in the House.
What they have done is an act of de
spotism, for they have denied congres
sional members the opportunity to
represent the people while, at the same
time, abusing their own responsibility
to act on the will of the people of their
own district. Once again, the
Democratically-controlled Congress is
trying to slip this one under the rug
and take advantage of the American
taxpayer. Rhodes recognized this, say
ing, "We have to have greater respect
for the intelligence of the American
people than to believe that they will
not see through this charade . . . we
must face up to our responsibility and
have a recorded vote." The Democrats
in the House subcommittee ignored

that responsibility, thinking first of
their own pockets and second of the
people they claim to represent.
In 1858, ina speech in Edwardsville,
111., Abraham Lincoln said, "Our re
liance is in the love of liberty which
God has planted in us. Our defense is
in the spirit which prizes liberty as the
heritage of all men, in all lands
everywhere. Destroy this spirit and
you have planted the seeds of de
spotism at your own doors." The
Democrats in the House of Representa
tives, by refusing to go on record with a
roll call vote on the issue of a pay raise,
have lost the spirit of representative
democracy. Liberty, for them, is not
"the heritage of all men."

The congressional pay hike which
went into effect last week is particu
larly disturbing, not only because
Congress doesn't deserve it, but more
importantly because it strikes at the
very heart and soul of the concept of
