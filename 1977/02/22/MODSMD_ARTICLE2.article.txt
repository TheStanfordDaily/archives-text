# Accreditation crisis forces change in hospital bylaws
## 
### Karen Wada 
Stanford Hospital's corporate
bylaws have been revised to meet ac
crediting agency standards, and to
clarify what hospital legal consul John
Schwartz calls ambiguities in wording
and in defining "who's responsible for
what."
While terming the changes "no big
deal," Schwartz said when an inde
pendent hospital accreditation com
mittee found many bylaw deficiencies,
its findings served ar. a "catalyst" for
the revisions.
Schwartz said the changes, made
Feb. 8, had been considered for some
time but that serious study began last
October. At that time, inspectors from
the accreditation committee first an
nounced they would visit the hospital.
"The old bylaws simply contained a
lot of ambiguities," Schwartz said.
"The University bought out Palo Al
to's 50 per cent interest when it took
over the center in 1968. Instead of
starting from ground zero, they just
modified existing bylaws."
Vague provisions
He said this created vague, often
contradicting provisions, many of
which were outdated by recently
revised state and private hospital
codes.

The new bylaws clear up what
Schwartz termed "the big question:
whether the Board of Hospital Direc
tors or the vice president for medical
affairs ran the hospital."
He said the same administrative
powers had been given to both offices,
though Vice President for Medical Af
fairs Clayton Rich had taken authority.
"But you'd ask one person who was in
charge, and he'd say the board. Ask
someone else, and he'd say Dean
Rich."
In the revised hierarchy, the Univer
sity president, through his hospital
chief executive officer (CEO) will
supervise the physical plant, grant
doctors' admission and hospital use
privileges, establish the hospital's
rules, enter into contracts, hire and fire
personnel and submit the annual hos
pital budget report to the Board of
Trustees.
Rich will continue
Rich was appointed CEO by Lyman
Friday, Schwartz said. In addition,
Rich will continue as vice president
for medical affairs, dean of the Medical
School and member of the Board of
Hospital Directors.
Schwartz explained that, while the
new bylaws make it technically possi
ble to appoint four individuals for

these positions, the University's prac
tice has been to give one person al 1 four
titles.
The CEO will also prepare monthly
financial statements, establish fee
rates for the hospital, obtain insurance,
plan growth and development ser
vices, and establish auxiliary organi
zations he believes the hospital needs.
The Board of Hospital Directors,
which had most of these powers, will
now take charge of the medical staff
and act as an appellate body for com
munity physicians who question deci
sions made by Rich or Lyman.
Another bylaw revision annuls life
long contracts given to community
doctors as part of the 1968 Palo Alto
changeover agreement (such contracts
are illegal in California). Additional
revisions define in detail the hospital
medical board, and explain proce
dures for Medical Board members'
privilege reviews.
They also require that the hospital
prepare and maintain adequate and
accurate medical records, and define
the powers of the Chief of Staff and the
newly-created President of the Medi
cal Board.
Schwartz said these changes are all
"of three main types. The first set
clarifies ambiguous language; the sec

ond is mainly technical — complying
with Title 22 of the state code, or with
the (accreditation) commission. Then
a few of the changes are just good ideas
we had."

lot of ambiguities," Schwartz said.
"The University bought out Palo Al
to's 50 per cent interest when it took
over the center in 1968. Instead of
starting from ground zero, they just
modified existing bylaws."
Vague provisions
He said this created vague, often
contradicting provisions, many of
which were outdated by recently
revised state and private hospital
codes.

The new bylaws clear up what
Schwartz termed "the big question:
whether the Board of Hospital Direc
tors or the vice president for medical
affairs ran the hospital."
He said the same administrative
powers had been given to both offices,
though Vice President for Medical Af
fairs Clayton Rich had taken authority.
"But you'd ask one person who was in
charge, and he'd say the board. Ask
someone else, and he'd say Dean
Rich."
In the revised hierarchy, the Univer
sity president, through his hospital
chief executive officer (CEO) will
supervise the physical plant, grant
doctors' admission and hospital use
privileges, establish the hospital's
rules, enter into contracts, hire and fire
personnel and submit the annual hos
pital budget report to the Board of
Trustees.
Rich will continue
Rich was appointed CEO by Lyman
Friday, Schwartz said. In addition,
Rich will continue as vice president
for medical affairs, dean of the Medical
School and member of the Board of
Hospital Directors.
Schwartz explained that, while the
new bylaws make it technically possi
ble to appoint four individuals for

these positions, the University's prac
tice has been to give one person al 1 four
titles.
The CEO will also prepare monthly
financial statements, establish fee
rates for the hospital, obtain insurance,
plan growth and development ser
vices, and establish auxiliary organi
zations he believes the hospital needs.
The Board of Hospital Directors,
which had most of these powers, will
now take charge of the medical staff
and act as an appellate body for com
munity physicians who question deci
sions made by Rich or Lyman.
Another bylaw revision annuls life
long contracts given to community
doctors as part of the 1968 Palo Alto
changeover agreement (such contracts
are illegal in California). Additional
revisions define in detail the hospital
medical board, and explain proce
dures for Medical Board members'
privilege reviews.
They also require that the hospital
prepare and maintain adequate and
accurate medical records, and define
the powers of the Chief of Staff and the
newly-created President of the Medi
cal Board.
Schwartz said these changes are all
"of three main types. The first set
clarifies ambiguous language; the sec

ond is mainly technical — complying
with Title 22 of the state code, or with
the (accreditation) commission. Then
a few of the changes are just good ideas
we had."
Stanford Hospital's corporate
bylaws have been revised to meet ac
crediting agency standards, and to
clarify what hospital legal consul John
Schwartz calls ambiguities in wording
and in defining "who's responsible for
what."
While terming the changes "no big
deal," Schwartz said when an inde
pendent hospital accreditation com
mittee found many bylaw deficiencies,
its findings served ar. a "catalyst" for
the revisions.
Schwartz said the changes, made
Feb. 8, had been considered for some
time but that serious study began last
October. At that time, inspectors from
the accreditation committee first an
nounced they would visit the hospital.
"The old bylaws simply contained a
lot of ambiguities," Schwartz said.
