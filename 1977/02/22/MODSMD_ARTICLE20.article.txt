# Collections forbidden
## Nuptial fees aid Mem Chu 
### Jordan Lorence 
Jane Lathrop Stanford, co
founder of the University, or
dered that no collections would
ever be taken in Memorial
Church because it might dis
courage students from attending
there.
Memorial Church has obeyed
that command over the years, yet
it has a budget of $127,000 for
this year. How does Mem Chu
get its money?
"We have two sources for our
funds," said Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-kelly. "The
University and a special en
dowment fund pay almost all of
our costs. Student wedding fees
pay for all the rest."
For the year 1975-76, the Uni
versity and the endowment fund
each contributed about half of
the Church's revenues, provid
ing $67,000 and $64,000, respec
tively.
For 1976-77, however, the
University is paying about
$90,000 and the endowment
provides $37,000 for expenses.
Hamerton-Kelly explained,
"The man who gave the endow
ment fund didn't like the way we
were spending the money, so he
transferred some of his money to
Financial Aids to give for athle
tic scholarships."
Student weddings are another
source of Mem Chu's income,
making up the balance.
The Church performs about
125 weddings a year, charging
students $125 and other eligible
members of the community,
$150.
"For the price, a couple gets
flowers, premarital counseling,

the works," said Hamerton
kelly. "Those weddings support
the Wedding Hostess, three stu
dent jobs and pay part of the
assistant dean's salary."
Hamerton-Kelly also
explained that the Church some
times has "retiring collections."
Baskets are placed outside the
doors and people are asked to
contribute to a certain cause or
charity.
Mem Chu's budget consists of
the same items as any other
church budget. Salaries and of
fice expenses use up most of the
funds.
"The Chapel Board, a group of

about 25 students and a few
other people, gives out scholar
ships each year for a summer fel
lowship program," said
Hamerton-Kelly.
"They give each person about
$:U)0. We've financed a broad
spectrum of activities. One stu
dent helped organize a senior
citizens' drug-buying co-op in
Arkansas. Another student
worked in Brazil for the Wycliffe
Bible translators," he added.
Each year, Mem Chu fills two
fellowship posts with a semi
nary student and a post-graduate
student to help at the Church.

"The Chapel Board, a group of

about 25 students and a few
other people, gives out scholar
ships each year for a summer fel
lowship program," said
Hamerton-Kelly.
"They give each person about
$:U)0. We've financed a broad
spectrum of activities. One stu
dent helped organize a senior
citizens' drug-buying co-op in
Arkansas. Another student
worked in Brazil for the Wycliffe
Bible translators," he added.
Each year, Mem Chu fills two
fellowship posts with a semi
nary student and a post-graduate
student to help at the Church.
Jane Lathrop Stanford, co
founder of the University, or
dered that no collections would
ever be taken in Memorial
Church because it might dis
courage students from attending
there.
Memorial Church has obeyed
that command over the years, yet
it has a budget of $127,000 for
this year. How does Mem Chu
get its money?
"We have two sources for our
funds," said Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-kelly. "The
University and a special en
dowment fund pay almost all of
our costs. Student wedding fees
pay for all the rest."
For the year 1975-76, the Uni
versity and the endowment fund
each contributed about half of
the Church's revenues, provid
ing $67,000 and $64,000, respec
tively.
For 1976-77, however, the
University is paying about
$90,000 and the endowment
provides $37,000 for expenses.
Hamerton-Kelly explained,
"The man who gave the endow
ment fund didn't like the way we
were spending the money, so he
transferred some of his money to
Financial Aids to give for athle
tic scholarships."
Student weddings are another
source of Mem Chu's income,
making up the balance.
The Church performs about
125 weddings a year, charging
students $125 and other eligible
members of the community,
$150.
"For the price, a couple gets
flowers, premarital counseling,

the works," said Hamerton
kelly. "Those weddings support
the Wedding Hostess, three stu
dent jobs and pay part of the
assistant dean's salary."
Hamerton-Kelly also
explained that the Church some
times has "retiring collections."
Baskets are placed outside the
doors and people are asked to
contribute to a certain cause or
charity.
Mem Chu's budget consists of
the same items as any other
church budget. Salaries and of
fice expenses use up most of the
funds.
