# Blood from Red Cross drives stays at home
## 
### Lisa Sonne 
While some students here
were giving Valentine's Day kis
ses last Tuesday, others were
giving blood — voluntarily — in
the Tresidder Lounge at a Red
Cross Mobile Blood Unit.
A number of people had to
overcome an acute fear of nee
dles before they allowed nurses
to "tap" their veins. Others
traded uneasy banter to bolster
their courage:
"You can take a gallon from
him — he's my roommate and 1
want a single."
"1 hope this isn't in vein."
Some, like Alison Parker, a
human biology major, were back
for a second time. Last January,
she astounded local Red Cross
officials by giving a pint of blood
in less than fouc minutes. It
stands as a local record.
One nurse said it was akin to
running a four-minute mile.
"Normally it takes five to 10 mi
nutes for the blood to get from
the arm into the bags," she said.
But speed records aside, why
give blood at all?
"As a student, giving blood is
probably one of the few altruistic
things you can do," said Marilee
Unruh, a junior who chairs the
Stanford Red Cross Blood drives.
"With the imminent opening of
the new wing of the Stanford
Hospital we need 50 per cent
more blood than ever before."
The campus drives are spon

sored by Alpha Phi Omega, a
service organization which also
coordinates the ride board and
stuffs registration packets.
"Students usually don't have
the money to contribute to
'worthy causes' and, even if they
did, dollars can't be transfused,"
Unruh noted. "Students also
don't have much time for a lot of
volunteer work, but giving blood
usually takes only 45 minutes for
the whole process — and it liter
ally saves lives."
The "whole process" includes
a medical check before the blood
is extracted and mandatory re
freshments afterwards.
The pint of blood someone
gives (an average person has
from 10-12 pints in his body) is
broken down into four parts:
platelets, cryoprecipitate,
packed red cells and fresh frozen
plasma. This is done to avoid
waste.
All blood donated on campus
goes to the Children's Hospital
or the Medical Center, according
to Dody Moffat, a donor recruiter
from Palo Alto.
Platelets are used for the
treatment of leukemia and other
cancers. Cryoprecipitates are
used in treatment of
hemophiliacs. Plasma and its
derivatives are needed for treat
ment of burns and shocks.
Packed red blood cells are
used in all kinds of surgery, no
tably open heart. Heart trans

plants and open heart surgery
are specialties of the Medical
Center. The hospital uses 456
pints a month for standard heart
surgery. But less than five per
cent of all qualified Americans
ever donate blood.
There are a number of reasons
for their hesitancy — some
legitimate, some not.
Medical requirements elimi
nate those weighing under 110
pounds, those not in the 17 to 65
age bracket, and those who had a
cold in the last two weeks.
Also excluded are persons
who have been tattoed, under
gone acupuncture or had their
ears pierced in the last six
months. This is because blood
from such donors is too likely to
induce hepatitis in recipients.
Unruh, however, thinks mis
conceptions stop most people
from giving.
"They think they're going to
be weakened for days and that
it's going to interfere with their
studying and sports," she said.
"Actually, you canusuallygoon
with your regular activities. The
blood volume is completely re
placed within 48 hours."
Akemi Chang, who gave blood
for the first time Valentine's Day,
said she was "swimming the
next morning feeling fine."
"Several students I've talked
to think that the Red Cross sells
the donated blood," Unruh ad
ded. "That's not true. Red Cross
hospital patients are charged
only for the processing (which
comes to about $20 a pint)."

Unruh also said the chances of
a recipient developing hepatitis
from a contaminated donation is
10 times as likely with a com
mercial donation than with a
volunteer donation. Paid donors
are less honest about their medi
cal history, she claimed.
Blood drives have been de
signed to be as convenient as
possible for students. On prear
ranged dates Red Cross blood
mobiles travel to residences and
set up in the lounges of dorms

and houses. Blood mobiles also
set up periodically in upstairs
Tresidder Union. Additionally
the Red Cross has two self con
tained mobile vans to service the
area.
Unruh is charged with finding
student volunteers in advance of
each drive. She tries to get be
tween 35 and 40 sign-ups—often
relying on student contacts in
residences. She also hopes for
some walk-ins.

Students who don't want to
wait for a blood drive on campus
can make an appointment to give
blood at the Red Cross Stanford
Blood Center. Lee Fort. Director
of Donor Resources at the Palo
Alto subcenter, said, "We need
100 pints a day in this area and
quite frankly this need isn't
being met."
One volunteer nurse said stu
dents must have reacted to the
spirit of Valentine's Day. The
turnout at Tresidder was good.

"So many donors back East can't
get out because of the weather,"
she said. "So we need to ship
some blood back there."
"All types of blood are
needed." Unruh said. "We're not
going to have any blood drives
on campus in March because of
finals and vacation, but we're
going to have seven in April and
eight in May."
But it will only just be enough
to meet this area's needs.

human biology major, were back
for a second time. Last January,
she astounded local Red Cross
officials by giving a pint of blood
in less than fouc minutes. It
stands as a local record.
One nurse said it was akin to
running a four-minute mile.
"Normally it takes five to 10 mi
nutes for the blood to get from
the arm into the bags," she said.
But speed records aside, why
give blood at all?
"As a student, giving blood is
probably one of the few altruistic
things you can do," said Marilee
Unruh, a junior who chairs the
Stanford Red Cross Blood drives.
"With the imminent opening of
the new wing of the Stanford
Hospital we need 50 per cent
more blood than ever before."
The campus drives are spon

sored by Alpha Phi Omega, a
service organization which also
coordinates the ride board and
stuffs registration packets.
"Students usually don't have
the money to contribute to
'worthy causes' and, even if they
did, dollars can't be transfused,"
Unruh noted. "Students also
don't have much time for a lot of
volunteer work, but giving blood
usually takes only 45 minutes for
the whole process — and it liter
ally saves lives."
The "whole process" includes
a medical check before the blood
is extracted and mandatory re
freshments afterwards.
The pint of blood someone
gives (an average person has
from 10-12 pints in his body) is
broken down into four parts:
platelets, cryoprecipitate,
packed red cells and fresh frozen
plasma. This is done to avoid
waste.
All blood donated on campus
goes to the Children's Hospital
or the Medical Center, according
to Dody Moffat, a donor recruiter
from Palo Alto.
Platelets are used for the
treatment of leukemia and other
cancers. Cryoprecipitates are
used in treatment of
hemophiliacs. Plasma and its
derivatives are needed for treat
ment of burns and shocks.
Packed red blood cells are
used in all kinds of surgery, no
tably open heart. Heart trans

plants and open heart surgery
are specialties of the Medical
Center. The hospital uses 456
pints a month for standard heart
surgery. But less than five per
cent of all qualified Americans
ever donate blood.
There are a number of reasons
for their hesitancy — some
legitimate, some not.
Medical requirements elimi
nate those weighing under 110
pounds, those not in the 17 to 65
age bracket, and those who had a
cold in the last two weeks.
Also excluded are persons
who have been tattoed, under
gone acupuncture or had their
ears pierced in the last six
months. This is because blood
from such donors is too likely to
induce hepatitis in recipients.
Unruh, however, thinks mis
conceptions stop most people
from giving.
"They think they're going to
be weakened for days and that
it's going to interfere with their
studying and sports," she said.
"Actually, you canusuallygoon
with your regular activities. The
blood volume is completely re
placed within 48 hours."
Akemi Chang, who gave blood
for the first time Valentine's Day,
said she was "swimming the
next morning feeling fine."
"Several students I've talked
to think that the Red Cross sells
the donated blood," Unruh ad
ded. "That's not true. Red Cross
hospital patients are charged
only for the processing (which
comes to about $20 a pint)."

Unruh also said the chances of
a recipient developing hepatitis
from a contaminated donation is
10 times as likely with a com
mercial donation than with a
volunteer donation. Paid donors
are less honest about their medi
cal history, she claimed.
Blood drives have been de
signed to be as convenient as
possible for students. On prear
ranged dates Red Cross blood
mobiles travel to residences and
set up in the lounges of dorms

and houses. Blood mobiles also
set up periodically in upstairs
Tresidder Union. Additionally
the Red Cross has two self con
tained mobile vans to service the
area.
Unruh is charged with finding
student volunteers in advance of
each drive. She tries to get be
tween 35 and 40 sign-ups—often
relying on student contacts in
residences. She also hopes for
some walk-ins.

Students who don't want to
wait for a blood drive on campus
can make an appointment to give
blood at the Red Cross Stanford
Blood Center. Lee Fort. Director
of Donor Resources at the Palo
Alto subcenter, said, "We need
100 pints a day in this area and
quite frankly this need isn't
being met."
One volunteer nurse said stu
dents must have reacted to the
spirit of Valentine's Day. The
turnout at Tresidder was good.

"So many donors back East can't
get out because of the weather,"
she said. "So we need to ship
some blood back there."
"All types of blood are
needed." Unruh said. "We're not
going to have any blood drives
on campus in March because of
finals and vacation, but we're
going to have seven in April and
eight in May."
But it will only just be enough
to meet this area's needs.

things you can do," said Marilee
Unruh, a junior who chairs the
Stanford Red Cross Blood drives.
"With the imminent opening of
the new wing of the Stanford
Hospital we need 50 per cent
more blood than ever before."
The campus drives are spon

sored by Alpha Phi Omega, a
service organization which also
coordinates the ride board and
stuffs registration packets.
"Students usually don't have
the money to contribute to
'worthy causes' and, even if they
did, dollars can't be transfused,"
Unruh noted. "Students also
don't have much time for a lot of
volunteer work, but giving blood
usually takes only 45 minutes for
the whole process — and it liter
ally saves lives."
The "whole process" includes
a medical check before the blood
is extracted and mandatory re
freshments afterwards.
The pint of blood someone
gives (an average person has
from 10-12 pints in his body) is
broken down into four parts:
platelets, cryoprecipitate,
packed red cells and fresh frozen
plasma. This is done to avoid
waste.
All blood donated on campus
goes to the Children's Hospital
or the Medical Center, according
to Dody Moffat, a donor recruiter
from Palo Alto.
Platelets are used for the
treatment of leukemia and other
cancers. Cryoprecipitates are
used in treatment of
hemophiliacs. Plasma and its
derivatives are needed for treat
ment of burns and shocks.
Packed red blood cells are
used in all kinds of surgery, no
tably open heart. Heart trans

plants and open heart surgery
are specialties of the Medical
Center. The hospital uses 456
pints a month for standard heart
surgery. But less than five per
cent of all qualified Americans
ever donate blood.
There are a number of reasons
for their hesitancy — some
legitimate, some not.
Medical requirements elimi
nate those weighing under 110
pounds, those not in the 17 to 65
age bracket, and those who had a
cold in the last two weeks.
Also excluded are persons
who have been tattoed, under
gone acupuncture or had their
ears pierced in the last six
months. This is because blood
from such donors is too likely to
induce hepatitis in recipients.
Unruh, however, thinks mis
conceptions stop most people
from giving.
"They think they're going to
be weakened for days and that
it's going to interfere with their
studying and sports," she said.
"Actually, you canusuallygoon
with your regular activities. The
blood volume is completely re
placed within 48 hours."
Akemi Chang, who gave blood
for the first time Valentine's Day,
said she was "swimming the
next morning feeling fine."
"Several students I've talked
to think that the Red Cross sells
the donated blood," Unruh ad
ded. "That's not true. Red Cross
hospital patients are charged
only for the processing (which
comes to about $20 a pint)."

Unruh also said the chances of
a recipient developing hepatitis
from a contaminated donation is
10 times as likely with a com
mercial donation than with a
volunteer donation. Paid donors
are less honest about their medi
cal history, she claimed.
Blood drives have been de
signed to be as convenient as
possible for students. On prear
ranged dates Red Cross blood
mobiles travel to residences and
set up in the lounges of dorms

and houses. Blood mobiles also
set up periodically in upstairs
Tresidder Union. Additionally
the Red Cross has two self con
tained mobile vans to service the
area.
Unruh is charged with finding
student volunteers in advance of
each drive. She tries to get be
tween 35 and 40 sign-ups—often
relying on student contacts in
residences. She also hopes for
some walk-ins.

Students who don't want to
wait for a blood drive on campus
can make an appointment to give
blood at the Red Cross Stanford
Blood Center. Lee Fort. Director
of Donor Resources at the Palo
Alto subcenter, said, "We need
100 pints a day in this area and
quite frankly this need isn't
being met."
One volunteer nurse said stu
dents must have reacted to the
spirit of Valentine's Day. The
turnout at Tresidder was good.

"So many donors back East can't
get out because of the weather,"
she said. "So we need to ship
some blood back there."
"All types of blood are
needed." Unruh said. "We're not
going to have any blood drives
on campus in March because of
finals and vacation, but we're
going to have seven in April and
eight in May."
But it will only just be enough
to meet this area's needs.

While some students here
were giving Valentine's Day kis
ses last Tuesday, others were
giving blood — voluntarily — in
the Tresidder Lounge at a Red
Cross Mobile Blood Unit.
A number of people had to
overcome an acute fear of nee
dles before they allowed nurses
to "tap" their veins. Others
traded uneasy banter to bolster
their courage:
"You can take a gallon from
him — he's my roommate and 1
want a single."
"1 hope this isn't in vein."
Some, like Alison Parker, a
human biology major, were back
for a second time. Last January,
she astounded local Red Cross
officials by giving a pint of blood
in less than fouc minutes. It
stands as a local record.
One nurse said it was akin to
running a four-minute mile.
"Normally it takes five to 10 mi
nutes for the blood to get from
the arm into the bags," she said.
But speed records aside, why
give blood at all?
