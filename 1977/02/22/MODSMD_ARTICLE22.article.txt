Campus Report announced the return of hous
ing listings last week. Despite very explicit in
structions, re., where to send listings and a
coupon, etc., we're already being hit with calls
from people who can't find their copy of Campus
Report.
The people who wanted the service restored said
Daily ads weren't satisfactory. There weren't
enough listings and they didn't want to rent their
housing to students.
Personally, 1 hope the new listing approach will
work. Got any ideas on how to encourage our
sophisticated community to follow very simple
directions? —8.8.
Yeah, first they should READ them. And for
those of you who "can't find your copy of Campus
Report," here's what's happening.
The ad service for faculty and staff, has been
revived under the sponsorship of the Stanford
Campus Homeowners Association (SCHOA).
Their rental housing service will be collecting the
listings and putting them in Campus Report for a

fee of $5 per two insertions of your ad.
If you are interested, send ads and payments to
SCHOA Rental Housing Listing Service, P.O. Box
7772, Stanford, Calif., 94305. Remember, DO NOT
send the listings to the Campus Report office. Cot
it?
Now that I am pulling mail out of a post office
box here on campus, does the P.O. object to the use
ofa littleoil on the dial? This one is a little tough to
move and 1 wonder if some 3-in-l would help?
—D.B.
Absolutely, "go right ahead," says Postman Ron
Sodlink. Incidently, Sodlink added that his office
is right next to the boxes and any way to get rid of
that "snap, snap, snap all day" is fine with him.
But you may want to save yourself $1.19 and a
trip to the local hardware store by letting someone
"behind the window" in the Post Office know
you've got a stubborn dial. Sodlink says they're
ready and waiting with their cans ofWD-40 (just as
good as 3-in-l, by the way).
