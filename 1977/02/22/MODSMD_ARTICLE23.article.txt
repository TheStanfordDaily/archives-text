## Plowing the Farm Joe Roth, the person 
### Paul Bauman 
The loss of Joe Roth hurts. It hurts
badly. And if 1, just a casual acquaintance
of his, can feel the pain here at Stanford,
what's it like right now for his family and
friends in Berkeley?
1 can imagine, and yet, I guess 1 really
can't.
Roth, an Ail-American quarterback at
California, died Saturday afternoon of
malignant melanoma, a virulent form of
cancer, in his Berkeley apartment. This
was Roth's second major bout with
cancer. He survived one operation three
years ago.
I want to talk basically about Joe Roth,
the person; not Joe Roth the Ail-American
quarterback. His bright professional fu
ture was his loss. His personality was our
loss, or at least the loss of everyone who
had the privilege of knowing him.
1 know it's customary to shower praise
upon the deceased, whether the person
was in fact a decent human being or not.
Well, I'm not just being nice; Roth was an
extraordinary person.
"As sorry as you feel for his friends and
family," said Fred Besana, one of Roth's
two closest friends on the team, "the
people who never got a chance to meet the
guy are the ones who really lost.
"People will remember him as a foot
ball player and for the great things he did
on the field. Those who know him
though, know him for the person he was.
The athletics is a very, very secondary
tiling."
So what kind of a person was Roth?
Positive.
"There was no doubt in his mind that
he was going to beat it (cancer)," said
Besana, who saw Roth every day or every

other day for a month prior to Saturday.
"Never did a non-positive t hi ng come out
of his mouth, at least not when 1 was with
him.
"It's so rare when a 21-year-old man
can have a positive effect on so many
people. It doesn't matter if he's an athlete
or whatever. He was positive."
Roth was courageous.
"He knew there was always a chance
(the cancer) would come back," Besana
said. "I tell ya, he fought it like hell. It was
the most god damn courageous thing I've
ever seen. He kept fighting it and fighting
it."
Roth was quiet and serious.
"A lot of time," Besana said, "there was
so much pressure on him that he kind of
kept to himself. He was serious, but
around friends he would loosen up.
"He had a great awareness of life
and...what it was all about. I le lived it and
understood what it took. His football ac
colades never became a priority in his life.
He understood in what light those should
be taken. You know, he understood."
Roth and Besana, also a quarterback,
fought for the starting job throughout
their two years at Cal. Besana started the
Bears' first three games in 1975, but Roth
went the rest of the way and set a flock of
records in the process.
Roth returned as the starter in 1976, but
Cal coach Mike White was determined to
play Besana also. Fittingly, Roth and Be
sana shared the quarterbacking duties in
their final collegiate game last November
against Stanford.
Cal players were divided in their evalu
ations of the two quarterbacks. Some felt
Roth was better than Besana. Some felt

Besana was better than Koth. ijuite a tew
said it didn't really matter who was in
there (Is this beginning to sound famil
iar?). Roth himself was in the latter group.
After Besana came in late against San
Jose State last fall and threw two
touchdown passes, Koth said ii he ever
got hurt, Besana could come in and "no
body would know the difference."
1 met Koth only once and, although the
meeting lasted just Ml) minutes or so, in
many ways I think 1 saw the real Joe Koth.
It happened before he became a football
celebrity, for one thing. It was about a
week before school began in 1975.1 was at
Cal, actually looking for Besana, with
whom I had worked that summer in Sac
ramento.
I was directed to a projection room in
the dorm where the team was staying. The
room was dark, but I recognized Koth
standing there (if 1 were so inclined, I'd
say this was definitely symbolic).
"You're joe Koth, huh?" I said. "Yeah,"
was all he said. He didn't look like a foot
ball player. He was tall, but very slim.
Roth told me to have a seat and wait for
Besana, who would be coming soon. I did
and we watched films ofCal's next oppo
nent, West Virginia. We talked casually,
but I don't remember exactly what was
said.
Besana arrived and the three of us con
tinued in the same vein.
That was the extent of my encounter
with Koth. He was quiet, but very polite. I
think I later told Fred that Koth "seemed
like a nice guy." Besana confirmed by
impression.
I wish 1 had the chance to find out for
myself.

Well, I'm not just being nice; Roth was an
extraordinary person.
"As sorry as you feel for his friends and
family," said Fred Besana, one of Roth's
two closest friends on the team, "the
people who never got a chance to meet the
guy are the ones who really lost.
"People will remember him as a foot
ball player and for the great things he did
on the field. Those who know him
though, know him for the person he was.
The athletics is a very, very secondary
tiling."
So what kind of a person was Roth?
Positive.
"There was no doubt in his mind that
he was going to beat it (cancer)," said
Besana, who saw Roth every day or every

other day for a month prior to Saturday.
"Never did a non-positive t hi ng come out
of his mouth, at least not when 1 was with
him.
"It's so rare when a 21-year-old man
can have a positive effect on so many
people. It doesn't matter if he's an athlete
or whatever. He was positive."
Roth was courageous.
"He knew there was always a chance
(the cancer) would come back," Besana
said. "I tell ya, he fought it like hell. It was
the most god damn courageous thing I've
ever seen. He kept fighting it and fighting
it."
Roth was quiet and serious.
"A lot of time," Besana said, "there was
so much pressure on him that he kind of
kept to himself. He was serious, but
around friends he would loosen up.
"He had a great awareness of life
and...what it was all about. I le lived it and
understood what it took. His football ac
colades never became a priority in his life.
He understood in what light those should
be taken. You know, he understood."
Roth and Besana, also a quarterback,
fought for the starting job throughout
their two years at Cal. Besana started the
Bears' first three games in 1975, but Roth
went the rest of the way and set a flock of
records in the process.
Roth returned as the starter in 1976, but
Cal coach Mike White was determined to
play Besana also. Fittingly, Roth and Be
sana shared the quarterbacking duties in
their final collegiate game last November
against Stanford.
Cal players were divided in their evalu
ations of the two quarterbacks. Some felt
Roth was better than Besana. Some felt

Besana was better than Koth. ijuite a tew
said it didn't really matter who was in
there (Is this beginning to sound famil
iar?). Roth himself was in the latter group.
After Besana came in late against San
Jose State last fall and threw two
touchdown passes, Koth said ii he ever
got hurt, Besana could come in and "no
body would know the difference."
1 met Koth only once and, although the
meeting lasted just Ml) minutes or so, in
many ways I think 1 saw the real Joe Koth.
It happened before he became a football
celebrity, for one thing. It was about a
week before school began in 1975.1 was at
Cal, actually looking for Besana, with
whom I had worked that summer in Sac
ramento.
I was directed to a projection room in
the dorm where the team was staying. The
room was dark, but I recognized Koth
standing there (if 1 were so inclined, I'd
say this was definitely symbolic).
"You're joe Koth, huh?" I said. "Yeah,"
was all he said. He didn't look like a foot
ball player. He was tall, but very slim.
Roth told me to have a seat and wait for
Besana, who would be coming soon. I did
and we watched films ofCal's next oppo
nent, West Virginia. We talked casually,
but I don't remember exactly what was
said.
Besana arrived and the three of us con
tinued in the same vein.
That was the extent of my encounter
with Koth. He was quiet, but very polite. I
think I later told Fred that Koth "seemed
like a nice guy." Besana confirmed by
impression.
I wish 1 had the chance to find out for
myself.

The loss of Joe Roth hurts. It hurts
badly. And if 1, just a casual acquaintance
of his, can feel the pain here at Stanford,
what's it like right now for his family and
friends in Berkeley?
1 can imagine, and yet, I guess 1 really
can't.
Roth, an Ail-American quarterback at
California, died Saturday afternoon of
malignant melanoma, a virulent form of
cancer, in his Berkeley apartment. This
was Roth's second major bout with
cancer. He survived one operation three
years ago.
I want to talk basically about Joe Roth,
the person; not Joe Roth the Ail-American
quarterback. His bright professional fu
ture was his loss. His personality was our
loss, or at least the loss of everyone who
had the privilege of knowing him.

"It's so rare when a 21-year-old man
can have a positive effect on so many
people. It doesn't matter if he's an athlete
or whatever. He was positive."
Roth was courageous.
"He knew there was always a chance
(the cancer) would come back," Besana
said. "I tell ya, he fought it like hell. It was
the most god damn courageous thing I've
ever seen. He kept fighting it and fighting
it."
Roth was quiet and serious.
"A lot of time," Besana said, "there was
so much pressure on him that he kind of
kept to himself. He was serious, but
around friends he would loosen up.
"He had a great awareness of life
and...what it was all about. I le lived it and
understood what it took. His football ac
colades never became a priority in his life.
He understood in what light those should
be taken. You know, he understood."
Roth and Besana, also a quarterback,
fought for the starting job throughout
their two years at Cal. Besana started the
Bears' first three games in 1975, but Roth
went the rest of the way and set a flock of
records in the process.
Roth returned as the starter in 1976, but
Cal coach Mike White was determined to
play Besana also. Fittingly, Roth and Be
sana shared the quarterbacking duties in
their final collegiate game last November
against Stanford.
Cal players were divided in their evalu
ations of the two quarterbacks. Some felt
Roth was better than Besana. Some felt

Besana was better than Koth. ijuite a tew
said it didn't really matter who was in
there (Is this beginning to sound famil
iar?). Roth himself was in the latter group.
After Besana came in late against San
Jose State last fall and threw two
touchdown passes, Koth said ii he ever
got hurt, Besana could come in and "no
body would know the difference."
1 met Koth only once and, although the
meeting lasted just Ml) minutes or so, in
many ways I think 1 saw the real Joe Koth.
It happened before he became a football
celebrity, for one thing. It was about a
week before school began in 1975.1 was at
Cal, actually looking for Besana, with
whom I had worked that summer in Sac
ramento.
I was directed to a projection room in
the dorm where the team was staying. The
room was dark, but I recognized Koth
standing there (if 1 were so inclined, I'd
say this was definitely symbolic).
"You're joe Koth, huh?" I said. "Yeah,"
was all he said. He didn't look like a foot
ball player. He was tall, but very slim.
Roth told me to have a seat and wait for
Besana, who would be coming soon. I did
and we watched films ofCal's next oppo
nent, West Virginia. We talked casually,
but I don't remember exactly what was
said.
Besana arrived and the three of us con
tinued in the same vein.
That was the extent of my encounter
with Koth. He was quiet, but very polite. I
think I later told Fred that Koth "seemed
like a nice guy." Besana confirmed by
impression.
I wish 1 had the chance to find out for
myself.

The loss of Joe Roth hurts. It hurts
badly. And if 1, just a casual acquaintance
of his, can feel the pain here at Stanford,
what's it like right now for his family and
friends in Berkeley?
1 can imagine, and yet, I guess 1 really
can't.
Roth, an Ail-American quarterback at
California, died Saturday afternoon of
malignant melanoma, a virulent form of
cancer, in his Berkeley apartment. This
was Roth's second major bout with
cancer. He survived one operation three
years ago.
I want to talk basically about Joe Roth,
the person; not Joe Roth the Ail-American
quarterback. His bright professional fu
ture was his loss. His personality was our
loss, or at least the loss of everyone who
had the privilege of knowing him.
1 know it's customary to shower praise
upon the deceased, whether the person
was in fact a decent human being or not.
Well, I'm not just being nice; Roth was an
extraordinary person.
"As sorry as you feel for his friends and
family," said Fred Besana, one of Roth's
two closest friends on the team, "the
people who never got a chance to meet the
guy are the ones who really lost.
"People will remember him as a foot
ball player and for the great things he did
on the field. Those who know him
though, know him for the person he was.
The athletics is a very, very secondary
tiling."
So what kind of a person was Roth?
Positive.
"There was no doubt in his mind that
he was going to beat it (cancer)," said
Besana, who saw Roth every day or every

other day for a month prior to Saturday.
"Never did a non-positive t hi ng come out
of his mouth, at least not when 1 was with
him.
"It's so rare when a 21-year-old man
