# Cougars mangle Cards, 69-52
## 
### David Georgette 
How can a team which won
only its first game in seven out
ings the night before come out
and play lethargically the next
game?
If you know the answer, that's
more than Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso knew Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion.
"I'm not sure what even hap
pened tonight," said Dißiaso in
the Stanford locker room after
his Cardinals had lost to
Washington State, 69-52. "We
weren't ready to play tonight.
We were flat; we were lethar
gic," Dißiaso said.
Card guard Mike Bratz agreed
with his coach's evaluations.
"We were pretty flat," said Bratz.
"They played a pretty effective
zone and we didn't get into the
rhythm of our offense."
Or the style of their shooting.
The Cards made a frigid 33 per
cent of their field goal attempts,
which included a 28 per cent ef
fort in the second half.
"You can't win if you don't
put the ball in the basket," said
Dißiaso. Starters Bratz, Tom
Schmalzried and Jeff McHugh
had a combined 12 for 39 per
formance from the block. "They
contained me pretty well," said
Bratz.
House leads WSU
Meanwhile, the Cougars had
all their starters but one connect
on more than half their shots.
They were paced by frontliner
Stuart House, who hit on all
eight of his first half attempts on
the way to a 32-28 Cougar lead at
intermission.
"Other than Kimberly Belton's
offensive performance, I can't
think of anything we did well,"
said Dißiaso. Belton, who is
statistically the Pacific-B's
fourth best field goal shooter, hit
on seven of his 12 shots from the
floor. Dick Dohrmann was the
only other Card to hit on more
than half his shots.

Despite their poor first-half
shooting, though, the Cards
were still in the hunt with 12
minutes left, down 42-40 after
Bratz had canned a jumper from
the top of the key.
But a Card turnover at the end
of a fast-break opportunity foiled
a chance to tie the game, and
then Coug Harold Rhodes scored
three consecutive hoops to make
in 48-40.
Turning point
"The turning point of the
game was when we had the ball
on a fast-break when we were
two points down and we turned
it over," said Dißiaso.
The Cards never got closer
than eight the rest of the game,
and four consecutive Cougar
baskets by senior Steve Puidokas
settled the issue at 59-46 with
three and a half minutes to play.
"Not only did we shoot
poorly, we didn't move well,"
said Dißiaso.

in 48-40.
Turning point
"The turning point of the
game was when we had the ball
on a fast-break when we were
two points down and we turned
it over," said Dißiaso.
The Cards never got closer
than eight the rest of the game,
and four consecutive Cougar
baskets by senior Steve Puidokas
settled the issue at 59-46 with
three and a half minutes to play.
"Not only did we shoot
poorly, we didn't move well,"
said Dißiaso.
How can a team which won
only its first game in seven out
ings the night before come out
and play lethargically the next
game?
If you know the answer, that's
more than Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso knew Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion.
"I'm not sure what even hap
pened tonight," said Dißiaso in
the Stanford locker room after
his Cardinals had lost to
Washington State, 69-52. "We
weren't ready to play tonight.
We were flat; we were lethar
gic," Dißiaso said.
Card guard Mike Bratz agreed
with his coach's evaluations.
"We were pretty flat," said Bratz.
"They played a pretty effective
zone and we didn't get into the
rhythm of our offense."
Or the style of their shooting.
The Cards made a frigid 33 per
cent of their field goal attempts,
which included a 28 per cent ef
fort in the second half.
"You can't win if you don't
put the ball in the basket," said
Dißiaso. Starters Bratz, Tom
Schmalzried and Jeff McHugh
had a combined 12 for 39 per
formance from the block. "They
contained me pretty well," said
Bratz.
House leads WSU
Meanwhile, the Cougars had
all their starters but one connect
on more than half their shots.
They were paced by frontliner
Stuart House, who hit on all
eight of his first half attempts on
the way to a 32-28 Cougar lead at
intermission.
"Other than Kimberly Belton's
offensive performance, I can't
think of anything we did well,"
said Dißiaso. Belton, who is
statistically the Pacific-B's
fourth best field goal shooter, hit
on seven of his 12 shots from the
floor. Dick Dohrmann was the
only other Card to hit on more
than half his shots.

Despite their poor first-half
shooting, though, the Cards
were still in the hunt with 12
minutes left, down 42-40 after
Bratz had canned a jumper from
the top of the key.
But a Card turnover at the end
of a fast-break opportunity foiled
a chance to tie the game, and
then Coug Harold Rhodes scored
three consecutive hoops to make
in 48-40.
