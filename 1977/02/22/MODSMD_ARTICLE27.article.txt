# Snap losing streak
## Cards beat Washington 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford assumed the Pacific-8 spoiler's role
Friday night when the Cards knocked off second
place Washington, the squad which just six days
before had beaten third-ranked UCLA, 74-69,
The victory snapped a six-game losing streak,
which lasted 30 days. The win also gave the Cards
10 wins—one more contest than they won all last
year.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso after the game. "1 never
thought we'd budge from nine. I thought our
players played with confidence and enthusiasm."
In the first game between the two teams, the
Huskies blew Stanford out of Seattle, 98-77. "I
thought we were in as much control of this gameas
Washington was in our game up there. As you
know they blew us out of the gym. That makes this
particularly satisfying."
Washington streak
It wasn't exactly a masterpiece though. Stanford,
ahead by nine points—sl-42—with 9:48 left in the
contest, forgot how to play the kind of basketball
which had enabled it to build up a lead.
The Huskies scored 14 straight points, as the
Washington press forced Stanford to turn the ball
over. "It's a shame that happened," said Dißiaso.
"We fumbled twice. It started with a three-point
play. On our next two possessions we fumbled it.
We had a couple of players out of position.
"I know it's hard to believe, but we practiced
against that press all week. I thought we played 39
minutes of good basketball and one minute of bad
basketball."
But Stanford came right back with its own
streak. The Cards scored 10 straight points, includ
ing six by freshman forward Kimberly Belton, to
take a 61-56 lead. And then strange things started
happening.
Harshman blows up
With the score tied at 61-all with 2:29 left in the
game, Husky guard Steve Malzen fouled Mike
Bratz. But Washington coach Marv Harshman felt
differently. Harshman, who has coached in the
Pacific-8 for 19 years, got a technical for his efforts.

Bratz, who finished with 27 points, eight re
bounds and five assists, sank the two foul shots
and both of the technical shots to put the Cards
ahead by four—6s-61.
With a four point lead to protect, Stanford went
into a stall and the only way Washington could get
the ball back was to foul.
Morgan comes through
The Huskies fouled the right person—walk-on
guard Darryle Morgan, who had a 33 per cent free
throw rating coming into the game.
But Morgan made five of eight free throws in the
last 1:09 as the Cards made eight of 12 free throws
to ice the victory.
"I had a hunch to go with Darryle Morgan at the
end of the game" said Dißiaso. "He came
through."
Harshman blamed his outburst for the loss.
"What else can you say. We just got beat. And I had
a lot to do with the loss," said Harshman.
"On the technical, 1 didn't say a thing. On the
foul, he just put his hands down, then he changed
his mind."

"I know it's hard to believe, but we practiced
against that press all week. I thought we played 39
minutes of good basketball and one minute of bad
basketball."
But Stanford came right back with its own
streak. The Cards scored 10 straight points, includ
ing six by freshman forward Kimberly Belton, to
take a 61-56 lead. And then strange things started
happening.
Harshman blows up
With the score tied at 61-all with 2:29 left in the
game, Husky guard Steve Malzen fouled Mike
Bratz. But Washington coach Marv Harshman felt
differently. Harshman, who has coached in the
Pacific-8 for 19 years, got a technical for his efforts.

Bratz, who finished with 27 points, eight re
bounds and five assists, sank the two foul shots
and both of the technical shots to put the Cards
ahead by four—6s-61.
With a four point lead to protect, Stanford went
into a stall and the only way Washington could get
the ball back was to foul.
Morgan comes through
The Huskies fouled the right person—walk-on
guard Darryle Morgan, who had a 33 per cent free
throw rating coming into the game.
But Morgan made five of eight free throws in the
last 1:09 as the Cards made eight of 12 free throws
to ice the victory.
"I had a hunch to go with Darryle Morgan at the
end of the game" said Dißiaso. "He came
through."
Harshman blamed his outburst for the loss.
"What else can you say. We just got beat. And I had
a lot to do with the loss," said Harshman.
"On the technical, 1 didn't say a thing. On the
foul, he just put his hands down, then he changed
his mind."

Freshman forward Kimberly Belton scores two of his nine points
in Stanford's 74-69 victory over Washington Friday night. Belton
scored six points to spark the Cards late in the game.
Stanford assumed the Pacific-8 spoiler's role
Friday night when the Cards knocked off second
place Washington, the squad which just six days
before had beaten third-ranked UCLA, 74-69,
The victory snapped a six-game losing streak,
which lasted 30 days. The win also gave the Cards
10 wins—one more contest than they won all last
year.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso after the game. "1 never
thought we'd budge from nine. I thought our
players played with confidence and enthusiasm."
In the first game between the two teams, the
Huskies blew Stanford out of Seattle, 98-77. "I
thought we were in as much control of this gameas
Washington was in our game up there. As you
know they blew us out of the gym. That makes this
particularly satisfying."
Washington streak
It wasn't exactly a masterpiece though. Stanford,
ahead by nine points—sl-42—with 9:48 left in the
contest, forgot how to play the kind of basketball
which had enabled it to build up a lead.
The Huskies scored 14 straight points, as the
Washington press forced Stanford to turn the ball
over. "It's a shame that happened," said Dißiaso.
"We fumbled twice. It started with a three-point
play. On our next two possessions we fumbled it.

"I had a hunch to go with Darryle Morgan at the
end of the game" said Dißiaso. "He came
through."
Harshman blamed his outburst for the loss.
"What else can you say. We just got beat. And I had
a lot to do with the loss," said Harshman.
"On the technical, 1 didn't say a thing. On the
foul, he just put his hands down, then he changed
his mind."

in Stanford's 74-69 victory over Washington Friday night. Belton
scored six points to spark the Cards late in the game.
Stanford assumed the Pacific-8 spoiler's role
Friday night when the Cards knocked off second
place Washington, the squad which just six days
before had beaten third-ranked UCLA, 74-69,
The victory snapped a six-game losing streak,
which lasted 30 days. The win also gave the Cards
10 wins—one more contest than they won all last
year.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso after the game. "1 never
thought we'd budge from nine. I thought our
players played with confidence and enthusiasm."
In the first game between the two teams, the
Huskies blew Stanford out of Seattle, 98-77. "I
thought we were in as much control of this gameas
Washington was in our game up there. As you
know they blew us out of the gym. That makes this
particularly satisfying."
Washington streak
It wasn't exactly a masterpiece though. Stanford,
ahead by nine points—sl-42—with 9:48 left in the
contest, forgot how to play the kind of basketball
which had enabled it to build up a lead.
The Huskies scored 14 straight points, as the
Washington press forced Stanford to turn the ball
over. "It's a shame that happened," said Dißiaso.
"We fumbled twice. It started with a three-point
play. On our next two possessions we fumbled it.
We had a couple of players out of position.
"I know it's hard to believe, but we practiced
against that press all week. I thought we played 39
minutes of good basketball and one minute of bad
basketball."
But Stanford came right back with its own
streak. The Cards scored 10 straight points, includ
ing six by freshman forward Kimberly Belton, to
take a 61-56 lead. And then strange things started
happening.
Harshman blows up
With the score tied at 61-all with 2:29 left in the
game, Husky guard Steve Malzen fouled Mike
Bratz. But Washington coach Marv Harshman felt
differently. Harshman, who has coached in the
Pacific-8 for 19 years, got a technical for his efforts.

Bratz, who finished with 27 points, eight re
bounds and five assists, sank the two foul shots
and both of the technical shots to put the Cards
ahead by four—6s-61.
With a four point lead to protect, Stanford went
into a stall and the only way Washington could get
the ball back was to foul.
Morgan comes through
The Huskies fouled the right person—walk-on
guard Darryle Morgan, who had a 33 per cent free
throw rating coming into the game.
But Morgan made five of eight free throws in the
last 1:09 as the Cards made eight of 12 free throws
to ice the victory.
"I had a hunch to go with Darryle Morgan at the
end of the game" said Dißiaso. "He came
through."
Harshman blamed his outburst for the loss.
"What else can you say. We just got beat. And I had
a lot to do with the loss," said Harshman.
"On the technical, 1 didn't say a thing. On the
foul, he just put his hands down, then he changed
his mind."
