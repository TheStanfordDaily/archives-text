# Oregon upsets UCLA
## 
### Chris Baker 
The Pacific-8 suddenly has a
basketball race on its hands.
Oregon saw to that Saturday
afternoon, when the Ducks
knocked off third-ranked UCLA,
64-55, to move into a first-place
tie with the Bruins.
Only Stanford and USC are
mathematically out of the race.
But it's still a safe bet that the
Bruins will win their 11th
straight Pac-8 title.
UCLA has three games left, all
in Los Angeles, against Stanford,
California and USC. Oregon
travels to Washington and
Washington State this weekend
and hosts Oregon State in the
last game. OSU has beaten Ore
gon twice this year.
Still, the Oregon basketball

fans are probably still celebrat
ing the Ducks' third consecutive
win over UCLA.
Forward Greg Ballard, whose
two free throws with one second
remaining gave Oregon a 61-60
victory over UCLA in Pauley
Pavilion last month, did it again
in Eugene, Ore.
The 6-foot-7 forward scored 28
points, 16 of them in the first
nine minutes of the second half,
to lead Oregon to an upset over
UCLA.
"Greg Ballard is the best
player in the Pac-8," said Duck
coach Dick Harter.'Tve said it all
along. It's just that the press up
here isn't as powerful as the
press in Los Angeles and he
hasn't gotten the recognition
that he should have."
Marquess Johnson
Harter was referring to the at
tention given UCLA All -
American Marquess Johnson,
who led the Bruins with 22
points.
Ballard connected on all seven
of his second half field goal at
tempts to rally the Ducks from a
37-29 halftime deficit.
Cal is the hottest team in the
Pac-8. The Bears won their
fourth straight conference game
Saturday night when they beat
Washington 86-58.
Ransom stars
Sophomore guard Gene Ran
som triggered a 17-0 scoring
binge midway through the game
and forward Ray Murray scored
24 points to lead Cal to a romp
over the slumping Huskies.

Ransom scored 10 of his 16
points in the 17-0 outburst that
gave the Bears a 43-31 lead early
in the second half. Center James
Edwards had 20 points for
Washington.
Friday night Cal gave
Washington State a 66-52 loss.
The Bears hit their first four
shots to take a 10-2 lead.
Leading scorers
Guard John Caselli and for
ward Doug True had 20 points
each for Cal. True also had eight
rebounds. Ransom had just four
points, but he dished out four
assists.
