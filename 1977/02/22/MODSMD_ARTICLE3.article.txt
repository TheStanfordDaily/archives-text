# University changes its position, will favor J.P. Stevens resolution
## 
### 
The University has shifted a previously announced posi
tion and decided to vote in favor of one of two resolutions
submitted to the stockholders of the J.P. Stevens Company,
according to Robert Augsburger, vice president for busi ness
and finance.
The University holds some 3000 shares of J.P. Stevens
stock.
The resolution which the University will apparently en
dorse calls for Stevens to release minority employment
information for the past three years and to summarize the
company's Affirmative Action Program Guidelines.
Support of such resolutions is in keeping with past Uni
versity action, according to Rodney Adams, director of fi
nance.
However, the University will probably abstain from vot
ing on a second proposal, according to Augsburger. That
proposal would require disclosure by Stevens of detailed
information concerning policy toward employes in labor
policies and practices.
The University holds the Stevens stock in a beneficiary
trust, with the donors of the stock currently receiving any
dividends. TheUniversity has "no supervisory responsibil

ity" over the stock, according to Augsburger, but it "would
not want to make any action which would have adverse
effects on the company," he said.
"This might include the second proposal," Augsburger
said, "because it calls for such wide disclosure."
According to Adams, the second proposal is "quite ex
treme" and could "possibly be detrimental to the stockhol
ders, the company and the price of the stock." Adams said
the University must consider the possible effects when cast
ing its votes.
Augsburger suggested that the purpose of the second
measure was to allow the Amalgamated Clothing and Tex
tile Workers Union to organize in Stevens factories, and that
he "was not sure that it is in the stockholders'best interest."
However, in light of the Stevens record of anti-union
activity, which Augsburger said was "less than exemplary"
the University will abstain on the second proposal.
After an organizational meeting Thursday night, the
Stanford Committee for Justice at J.P. Stevens mobilized a
campus petition drive which collected 600 student and staff
signatures on Friday, according to Steven Vettel, member of
the Committee. In addition, the Com
mittee collected faculty signatures on
a letter "written mostly by Mark Man
call," Vettel said. Mancall is director of
Overseas Studies.
Vettel said the petition drive will
continue until Wednesday. The Com
mittee will then begin organizing a
local boycott of Stevens products, part
of a larger natonal boycott move now
being organized, he added.
Stevens is a manufacturer of textiles.
Among its products are Utica and
Mohawk sheets and pillow cases and
other carpet and hosiery brands.

However, in light of the Stevens record of anti-union
activity, which Augsburger said was "less than exemplary"
the University will abstain on the second proposal.
After an organizational meeting Thursday night, the
Stanford Committee for Justice at J.P. Stevens mobilized a
campus petition drive which collected 600 student and staff
signatures on Friday, according to Steven Vettel, member of
the Committee. In addition, the Com
mittee collected faculty signatures on
a letter "written mostly by Mark Man
call," Vettel said. Mancall is director of
Overseas Studies.
Vettel said the petition drive will
continue until Wednesday. The Com
mittee will then begin organizing a
local boycott of Stevens products, part
of a larger natonal boycott move now
being organized, he added.
Stevens is a manufacturer of textiles.
Among its products are Utica and
Mohawk sheets and pillow cases and
other carpet and hosiery brands.
The University has shifted a previously announced posi
tion and decided to vote in favor of one of two resolutions
submitted to the stockholders of the J.P. Stevens Company,
according to Robert Augsburger, vice president for busi ness
and finance.
The University holds some 3000 shares of J.P. Stevens
stock.
The resolution which the University will apparently en
dorse calls for Stevens to release minority employment
information for the past three years and to summarize the
company's Affirmative Action Program Guidelines.
Support of such resolutions is in keeping with past Uni
versity action, according to Rodney Adams, director of fi
nance.
However, the University will probably abstain from vot
ing on a second proposal, according to Augsburger. That
proposal would require disclosure by Stevens of detailed
information concerning policy toward employes in labor
policies and practices.
The University holds the Stevens stock in a beneficiary
trust, with the donors of the stock currently receiving any
dividends. TheUniversity has "no supervisory responsibil

ity" over the stock, according to Augsburger, but it "would
not want to make any action which would have adverse
effects on the company," he said.
"This might include the second proposal," Augsburger
said, "because it calls for such wide disclosure."
According to Adams, the second proposal is "quite ex
treme" and could "possibly be detrimental to the stockhol
ders, the company and the price of the stock." Adams said
the University must consider the possible effects when cast
ing its votes.
Augsburger suggested that the purpose of the second
measure was to allow the Amalgamated Clothing and Tex
tile Workers Union to organize in Stevens factories, and that
he "was not sure that it is in the stockholders'best interest."
However, in light of the Stevens record of anti-union
activity, which Augsburger said was "less than exemplary"
the University will abstain on the second proposal.
