# Lofton, Albritton shine
## Spikers down Hayward 
### Bruce Anderson 
James Lofton sparked an im
pressive early-season showing
by Stanford's runners, as the
Cardinals opened the outdoor
track and field season by down
ing Hayward State, 95-68,
Saturday at Stanford.
With victories and meet re
cords in the 200 and 400, Lofton
paced the Cardinals to what
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
said was "the best running and
hurdling we've opened with in
years.
"We need rain for the farmers,
but this weather has been a bles
sing for runners," Jordan said in
explanation of the Cardinals'
performance on the Stanford
Stadium oval.
Lofton, Albritton
Lofton, who also won the long
jump, and Terry Albritton, a
double winner in the shot and
discus, were Stanford's only
field event winners, as Hayward
State won the javelin and high
jump, went 1-2 in the triple jump
and swept the pole vault and
hammer throw.
But the meet was decided on
Stanford's eight-lane track
where the Card cindermen won
eight of 11 running events, set
ting meet records in six, and out
scored the Pioneers, 69-22.
As in past years, the distance
running corps, emerged as the
point production mainstay for
Stanford.
Stacy Geiken set the tone of
the meet by establishing a meet
record of 9:24.6 on his way to
victory in the steeplechase, the
opening running event.
Freshman Bill Haldeman and
Craig Corey completed the first
of three Stanford sweeps in the
distance events.
Meet record
Steve Crowley had to set a
meet mark to defeat teammate
Dave Wells and Bill Gail in the
1500. Crowley broke the tape at
3:51.6.
Jeff Parietti held off the chal

lenge of teammate Jerry Emory to
top the 5000 field in 14:31.4.
But while Stanford track fol
lowers have come to expect the
feats of the distance runners as
routine, the showing of Lofton
and the sprinters was pleasant in
its timeliness.
The meet was tied at 43-all
when the 400-meter runners
toed the starting line. Lofton and
second-place finisher Alan
Sheats blazed to personal bests
of 46.6 and 46.8 to hand Stanford
a seven-point advantage.
Hayward lead
Later, a 1-2 finish by Hayward
State in the triple jump put the
Pioneers ahead, 62-60.
Tom Shellworth, who trans
ferred to Stanford from Foothill
Junior College, closed the gap to
one point by winning the 400 in
termediate hurdles in 52.9, 1.5
seconds better than his previous
lifetime best. Decathlete Carl
Johnk's earlier win in the 110-
meter highs gave Ctanford twin
hurdle victories.
Lofton, the Cards' top point
earner in 1976, picked up five
points for Stanford by winning
the 200 with his second personal
best oftheday — a 21.0 clocking.
His points put Stanford on top to
stay. Freshman Gordy Banks,
who had earlier placed second in
the 100, shadowed Lofton the
entire race, finishing second in
21.2.
"I'm glad to have the chance to
get in some running along with
my long jumping," said Lofton.

"It allows me to live out my fan
tasies, find out what my
maximum potential is."
Despite its success on the
track, with few exceptions, Stan
ford had little to talk about in the
field events. The few exceptions
were named Lofton and Albrit
ton.
Lofton started his day instruct
ing youngsters how to long jump
at a pre-meet clinic. After ad
journing class, Lofton began his
record-breaking binge destroy
ing the long jump mark he set
last year with a leap of 25-4V2.
Albritton didn't make it to the
pre-meet clinic. And he barely
made it to the meet.
Travel problems
After competing in the Jac-
In-The-Box Games Friday night,
the6-foot-4 shot putter had trou
ble catching a plane out of San
Diego. He arrived Saturday dur
ing the introduction of the shot
put field.
His warmup put was a stand
ing put of 57-7, which would
have been good enough to win if
he had fouled all the rest of his
puts.
Throwing without the benefit
of any warm-up, Albritton broke
his four-year-old outdoor school
record with a 63-8 put.
Later, Albritton edged
freshman teammate Kick Buss to
win the discus with a toss of
162-10, his first competitive dis
cus throws in four years.
Buss threw 160-6 to finish
second.

finished second. Earlier in the meet, Lofton won the long jump
and 400 meters.
James Lofton sparked an im
pressive early-season showing
by Stanford's runners, as the
Cardinals opened the outdoor
track and field season by down
ing Hayward State, 95-68,
Saturday at Stanford.
With victories and meet re
cords in the 200 and 400, Lofton
paced the Cardinals to what
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
said was "the best running and
hurdling we've opened with in
years.
"We need rain for the farmers,
but this weather has been a bles
sing for runners," Jordan said in
explanation of the Cardinals'
performance on the Stanford
Stadium oval.
Lofton, Albritton
Lofton, who also won the long
jump, and Terry Albritton, a
double winner in the shot and
discus, were Stanford's only
field event winners, as Hayward
State won the javelin and high
jump, went 1-2 in the triple jump
and swept the pole vault and
hammer throw.
But the meet was decided on
Stanford's eight-lane track
where the Card cindermen won
eight of 11 running events, set
ting meet records in six, and out
scored the Pioneers, 69-22.
As in past years, the distance
running corps, emerged as the
point production mainstay for
Stanford.
Stacy Geiken set the tone of
the meet by establishing a meet
record of 9:24.6 on his way to
victory in the steeplechase, the
opening running event.
Freshman Bill Haldeman and
Craig Corey completed the first
of three Stanford sweeps in the
distance events.
Meet record
Steve Crowley had to set a
meet mark to defeat teammate
Dave Wells and Bill Gail in the
1500. Crowley broke the tape at
3:51.6.
Jeff Parietti held off the chal

lenge of teammate Jerry Emory to
top the 5000 field in 14:31.4.
But while Stanford track fol
lowers have come to expect the
feats of the distance runners as
routine, the showing of Lofton
and the sprinters was pleasant in
its timeliness.
The meet was tied at 43-all
when the 400-meter runners
toed the starting line. Lofton and
second-place finisher Alan
Sheats blazed to personal bests
of 46.6 and 46.8 to hand Stanford
a seven-point advantage.
Hayward lead
Later, a 1-2 finish by Hayward
State in the triple jump put the
Pioneers ahead, 62-60.
Tom Shellworth, who trans
ferred to Stanford from Foothill
Junior College, closed the gap to
one point by winning the 400 in
termediate hurdles in 52.9, 1.5
seconds better than his previous
lifetime best. Decathlete Carl
Johnk's earlier win in the 110-
meter highs gave Ctanford twin
hurdle victories.
Lofton, the Cards' top point
earner in 1976, picked up five
points for Stanford by winning
the 200 with his second personal
best oftheday — a 21.0 clocking.
His points put Stanford on top to
stay. Freshman Gordy Banks,
who had earlier placed second in
the 100, shadowed Lofton the
entire race, finishing second in
21.2.
"I'm glad to have the chance to
get in some running along with
my long jumping," said Lofton.

"It allows me to live out my fan
tasies, find out what my
maximum potential is."
Despite its success on the
track, with few exceptions, Stan
ford had little to talk about in the
field events. The few exceptions
were named Lofton and Albrit
ton.
Lofton started his day instruct
ing youngsters how to long jump
at a pre-meet clinic. After ad
journing class, Lofton began his
record-breaking binge destroy
ing the long jump mark he set
last year with a leap of 25-4V2.
Albritton didn't make it to the
pre-meet clinic. And he barely
made it to the meet.
Travel problems
After competing in the Jac-
In-The-Box Games Friday night,

put field.
His warmup put was a stand
ing put of 57-7, which would
have been good enough to win if
he had fouled all the rest of his
puts.
Throwing without the benefit
of any warm-up, Albritton broke
his four-year-old outdoor school
record with a 63-8 put.
Later, Albritton edged
freshman teammate Kick Buss to
win the discus with a toss of
162-10, his first competitive dis
cus throws in four years.
Buss threw 160-6 to finish
second.

second.

Hayward State Saturday. Teammate Alan Sheats (middle)
finished second. Earlier in the meet, Lofton won the long jump
and 400 meters.
James Lofton sparked an im
pressive early-season showing
by Stanford's runners, as the
Cardinals opened the outdoor
track and field season by down
ing Hayward State, 95-68,
Saturday at Stanford.
With victories and meet re
cords in the 200 and 400, Lofton
paced the Cardinals to what
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
said was "the best running and
hurdling we've opened with in
years.
"We need rain for the farmers,
but this weather has been a bles
sing for runners," Jordan said in
explanation of the Cardinals'
performance on the Stanford
Stadium oval.
Lofton, Albritton
Lofton, who also won the long
jump, and Terry Albritton, a
double winner in the shot and
discus, were Stanford's only
field event winners, as Hayward
State won the javelin and high
jump, went 1-2 in the triple jump
and swept the pole vault and
hammer throw.
But the meet was decided on
Stanford's eight-lane track
where the Card cindermen won
eight of 11 running events, set
ting meet records in six, and out
scored the Pioneers, 69-22.
As in past years, the distance
running corps, emerged as the
point production mainstay for
Stanford.
Stacy Geiken set the tone of
the meet by establishing a meet
record of 9:24.6 on his way to
victory in the steeplechase, the
opening running event.
Freshman Bill Haldeman and
Craig Corey completed the first
of three Stanford sweeps in the
distance events.
Meet record
Steve Crowley had to set a
meet mark to defeat teammate
Dave Wells and Bill Gail in the
1500. Crowley broke the tape at
3:51.6.
Jeff Parietti held off the chal

lenge of teammate Jerry Emory to
top the 5000 field in 14:31.4.
But while Stanford track fol
lowers have come to expect the
feats of the distance runners as
routine, the showing of Lofton
and the sprinters was pleasant in
its timeliness.
The meet was tied at 43-all
when the 400-meter runners
toed the starting line. Lofton and
second-place finisher Alan
Sheats blazed to personal bests
of 46.6 and 46.8 to hand Stanford
a seven-point advantage.
Hayward lead
Later, a 1-2 finish by Hayward
State in the triple jump put the
Pioneers ahead, 62-60.
Tom Shellworth, who trans
ferred to Stanford from Foothill
Junior College, closed the gap to
one point by winning the 400 in
termediate hurdles in 52.9, 1.5
seconds better than his previous
lifetime best. Decathlete Carl
Johnk's earlier win in the 110-
meter highs gave Ctanford twin
hurdle victories.
Lofton, the Cards' top point
earner in 1976, picked up five
points for Stanford by winning
the 200 with his second personal
best oftheday — a 21.0 clocking.
His points put Stanford on top to
stay. Freshman Gordy Banks,
who had earlier placed second in
the 100, shadowed Lofton the
entire race, finishing second in
21.2.
"I'm glad to have the chance to
get in some running along with
my long jumping," said Lofton.

"It allows me to live out my fan
tasies, find out what my
maximum potential is."
Despite its success on the
track, with few exceptions, Stan
ford had little to talk about in the
field events. The few exceptions
were named Lofton and Albrit
ton.
Lofton started his day instruct
ing youngsters how to long jump
at a pre-meet clinic. After ad
journing class, Lofton began his
record-breaking binge destroy
ing the long jump mark he set
last year with a leap of 25-4V2.
Albritton didn't make it to the
pre-meet clinic. And he barely
made it to the meet.
Travel problems
After competing in the Jac-
In-The-Box Games Friday night,
the6-foot-4 shot putter had trou
ble catching a plane out of San
Diego. He arrived Saturday dur
ing the introduction of the shot
put field.
His warmup put was a stand
ing put of 57-7, which would
have been good enough to win if
he had fouled all the rest of his
puts.
Throwing without the benefit
of any warm-up, Albritton broke
his four-year-old outdoor school
record with a 63-8 put.
Later, Albritton edged
freshman teammate Kick Buss to
win the discus with a toss of
162-10, his first competitive dis
cus throws in four years.
Buss threw 160-6 to finish
second.
