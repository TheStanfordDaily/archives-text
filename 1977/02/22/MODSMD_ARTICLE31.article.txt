# Baseball team takes doubleheader
## 
### Chris Kamel 
The only thing that beat Stan
ford's varsity baseball team over
the weekend was the rain. The
Cards managed to sweep their
Saturday doubleheader with
UC-Davis, 10-1 and 6-1, but the
annual Alumni-varsity baseball
game on Sunday was rained out.
The fans, at least those who
were willing to battle the rain,
were treated to an Old-Timers
game pitting the graduates of
even-numbered years against

the odd years.
Led by the two-run triple of
Mark Lucich, now with the Cin
cinnati Reds, and the one-run
single of Pete Middlekauf, for
merly of the Minnesota Twins,
the even-numbered years rallied
in the third and final inning for a
3-1 win.
Chicago Cubs
In the lineup for the alumni
was 1976 graduate Steve Davis.
Remember him, the holder of
two single season and five career

Stanford records? Well, Davis'
success at Stanford has carried
into the pros, where he will be
starting spring training with the
Chicago Cubs at the beginning of
next month.
"I'm really excited about it,"
said Davis. "I'm sure that the Hill
Madlock-Bobby Murcer deal had
to do with it." Davis, who was at
home at Stanford Sunken
Diamond at his third base posi
tion, has been playing shortstop
since graduating last June. He
played in a rookie league in
Florida and a winter league in
Arizona, becoming an all-star in
both.
As of March 1, however, the
real work will start, according to
Davis. And the ex-Card will
make the most of it since he said
that "it is quite unusual for a
player like me to be invited so
early."
Sweep
Before the alumni game, the
Cards had improved their season
record to 9-3 with two easy vic
tories over UC-Davis.
Behind the eighth inning three
hit performance of winning
pitcher Brian Harrison and the
balanced hitting of Stanford's of
fense, the Cards put away the
game with a seven run explosion
in the fourth inning. Every Card
got a hit in the game except for
first baseman Tom Cuardino. "I
was very pleased with our hit
ting," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "Tom is still in a
slump but he'll come out of it."
In the first game Mike Codiroli
belted his second home run of
the season while Randy Wong,
Kevin Triggs and Cary Scott all
slammed triples.
Bruce Fiala gave up a solo
home run bv Davis' Rick Martini

on his third pitch of the day but
kept Davis in check tor the rest of
the day on four hits for a 6-1 vic
tory. Reynolds capped a five hit
afternoon with a triple in the
game.
The Cards travel to Stanislaus
State today and Sacramento
State tomorrow for 2:30 games.
