# Cal sinks Cards
## 
### Julie Fiedler 
Stanford's 35-year dual meet
swimming streak over Cal was
snapped Saturday as Bear
swimmers overtook the Cards
73-40. Fielding its deepest team
in history, California was able to
dominate the scoring by finish
ing two swimmers in the first
three places in every event.
1976 NCAA Champion diver
Joe Styger captured a double win
foi 4 the Bears, while only three
oftier firsts were gathered in in
dividual events. But nine of 11
second places, seven thirds and
a sweep of the relays gave Cal the
necessary points to overcome
their cross-bay rivals.
Of the 40 points which Stan
ford accumulated, swimmers
Mike Bruner and Dave Fairbank
accounted for 25. Bruner once
again became a meet triple win
ner in taking the 200 free
11:39.3), thesoo free (4:35.3) and
the 200 fly (1:48.9). Bruner's 200
fly time Saturday is the fastest
time recorded in the country in
that event this season.

Stanford senior Dave Fairbank
continued to shave time off his
sprint events as he won both the
50 and 100 freestyle. Fairbank,
"feeling better every week,"
swam the fastest time yet of the
collegiate season, beating his
brother Jim of Cal by a half
second with a 20.5 clocking in
the 50-yard sprint. With goals set
for the NCAAs next month in
Cleveland, Fairbank may be the
first swimmer ever to hit the
under-20 mark.
Freshman distance man Paul
Hartloff was the only other Card
swimmer winner besides Bruner
and Fairbank. Tormented with a
case of bronchitis earlier this
season, Hartloff has been gradu
ally making a comeback. His
time of 15:52.3 in the 1650 qual
ifies him for National Champ
ionship competition.
Cal swimmers produced some
good times although as one
swimmer put it,"The time was
more important against IJCLA
(two weeks ago); the place is
more important here."
