Soviets decry American repression
Moscow — The Soviet press is striking back at
Western reports of repression in the Soviet Union by
publishing a flurry of its own dispatches about "dis
sidents" in America.
While warning the United States to stay out of
Soviet internal affairs, Soviet newspapers are at the
same time printing an unusual number of stories
about America under headlines like "Justice, U.S.-
Style" and "Persecuted For Their Views."
The Soviet accounts, openly based on American
press reports, focus on American Indians, blacks,
Communists, antiwar activists and the "tens of
thousands of American citizens whose civil rights
are crudely violated by the witch-hunters of the CIA
and FBI."
A recent Tass dispatch, borrowing phrases from
Western dispatches about the Communist world,
said the United States "is in danger of turning into a
police state."
This kind of coverage about the West is not new to
the Soviet press, but the suddenly increased volume
— two or three stories a day — is a marked departure
from past practice.
Western observers say the Soviet Union is prepar
ing a defense against human rights accusations at a
forthcoming conference in Belgrade which will as
sess adherence to the 1975 Helsinki accords.
Rain breaks West Coast drought
Substantial amounts of rain fell on the dusty-dry
West Coast through yesterday, and most areas locked
in the two-year drought were joyfully awaiting two
more moisture-laden fronts due later in the week.
San Francisco recorded half an inch of rain while
across the Golden Gate arid Marin County received
1.25 at kentfield. About 100 miles to the north,
Ukiah reported 1.33 of an inch and Crescent City,
near the Oregon border, recorded .99.
"There should be a little more rain today," said
Kay Williams of the National Weather Service.
"Then another front, at least as strong as the last, is a
possibility for Thursday. But 1 don't really think the

system will be strong enough to put a dent in the
current dry spell."
Forecasters said the stubborn Pacific high pres
sure, which has remained about 200 miles northeast
of San Francisco, slipped down to a point off the Baja
Peninsula, permitting the storm systems to move
ashore.
IBM system reports toilet traffic
Paris— A computerized telephone switching sys
tem installed at a French insurance company was
supposed to boost productivity, but a labor union
says the device spied on employes to the extent of
knowing when they went to the bathroom.
IBM, which set up the system, said it was designed
for efficiency, not spying, and that neither IBM nor
the machine can be blamed for the way someone else
uses it.
Assurances Generales de France, which had the
system installed in its six-story computer center a
year ago, will not talk publicly about the criticism
from the French Confederation of Democratic Work
ers and the French press.
The machine is IBM's model 3750, which costs
about $240,000. It stores up to 100 numbers, reduces
telephone dialing to three digits, records time and
destination of calls, facilitates conference hookups
and performs other time-saving telephone functions.
Linked to a computer and a device which reads
special identity cards, or badges, the 3750 also can
record who enters or leaves a room or building, at
what time and by what door, thereby controlling
access to areas designated "secure" by management.
Union representative Gerard Lobjeoie said as a
result of the press campaign and union pressure,
management agreed to replace the card-readers with
electric eyes, which now open and close the doors in
the computer center when someone passes through a
beam of light.
Vance's tour results in pessimism
Damascus, Syria — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
concluded his Mideast tour yesterday with a warn

ing against being "overly optimistic" about a quick
Middle East peace.
Arriving at Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington after a week-long trip, Vance said:
"We have made a first step but the road ahead is
long and difficult."
Earlier, he told a news conference in Syria: "The
two sides are deeply divided on the method of resol
ving the core questions."
He listed these as peace, Israeli withdrawal and
the Palestinians.
The major hurdle Vance encountered was disag
reement — even among the Arabs themselves — on
how to represent the Palestinians in any new negoti
ations.
The Arabs want the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion to participate in Geneva, but they are divided
whether the PLO should go by itself or jointly with
Jordan, as suggested by Egypt's President Anwar
Sadat.
Regarding peace, Vance said the Arabs defined
this as an end to war while Israel wants a full nor
malization of relations, including exchanges of am
bassadors and free travel between countries
Amin invites inquiry into clergy deaths
Nairobi, Kenya — Radio Uganda says President
Idi Amin would welcome any foreign government
delegation to investigate the situation in Uganda,
where the Anglican archbishop and two government
ministers died under controversial circumstances
last week.
Amin has steadfastly insisted that Archbishop
Luwum and cabinet ministers Erinayo Oryema and
Charles Oboth-Ofumbi were killed in divine retribu
tion for their plot to overthrow him and to create
chaos in Uganda.
