### 
Soviet endocrinologist Mikhail
Shtern, now serving an eight-year sen
tence in a Soviet labor camp, has been
invited to lecture at the Medical
School here and at the University of
California Medical Center in San Fran
cisco.
The chances of Shtern being re
leased to come here are small,
Medicine Department Chairman
Daniel Federman said. Federman was
one of six persons to request Shtern's
release in letters last month.
Shtern is "a very fine person in his

field," said Dr. Arthur Kornberg, a
Nobel laureate in medicine and a
biochemistry professor.
If Shtern did come here, Federman
said, he wouldn't give a formal course.
Instead, he would give a few lectures
and seminars, and dosomeconsulting.
These and other expenses would be
funded from already established ac
counts for visiting lecturers, Kornberg
said.
On Dec. 31, 1974, Shtern was sen
tenced to eight years of hard labor by a
Ukranian court on charges of bribe tak
ing.
"From all indications we've seen,
these were fictitious charges,"
Kornberg said.
Last year the Endocrine Society
sponsored a resolution appealing to
the Soviet government to release
Shtern. "We find scientific coopera
tive efforts obstructed by thoughts of
Dr. Shtern's continued imprison
ment," the resolution said.
In January, 90 scientists, including
Nobel Prize winners Kornberg. David
Baltimore, Baruch Blumberg, Joshua
Lederberg, Howard Temin and George
Wald signed a New York Times ad cal
ling for Shtern's release.
Shtern's research has included
studies of how endocrines affect sex
ual differentiation, according to
Federman. "It's not a field in which
there are a great many people work
ing," he noted.
In 1974, when he was arrested,
Shtern directed the Vinnitsa Provin
cial Endocrinological Center in the
Ukraine.
