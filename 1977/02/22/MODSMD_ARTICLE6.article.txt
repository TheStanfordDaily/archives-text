# Berlin campus will close because of high costs

Stanford-in-Berlin will close after
this year "solely for financial reasons",
Director of Overseas Studies Mark
Mancall announced Friday.
"If in the future we can find funds to
reopen Berlin, 1 personally see no
reason we shouldn't reopen Berlin,"
he said.
Berlin offered a very generous rental
arrangement for the Villa Muthesius,
where the campus's classrooms and of
fices are. Mancall said.
But additional annual expenditures
for salaries, transportation and student
subsidies would come to $75,000 to
$HO,OOO per year, and that money is not
available in the budget, Mancall wrote
in a letter to Martin Ouilisch, munici
pal district representative from
Zehlendorf, where the villa is located.
Phil Lane, a student representative
on the Committee for Foreign Studies
Programs (C-FSP) said, "We have
tried, I think, everything." Even Ber
lin's closure will not meet the overseas
studies budget for 1978-79, he said,
but, he added, the budget can be met
without cutting other programs.
"Final budgetary control is with the
Provost's Office," he said.
"Funding will have to be in compet
ition with other new opportunities and
other programs," said Provost William
Miller.
According to Dave Glen, associate
general secretary, proposals for fun
draising projects are cleared by the
provost and given a priority. Then, the
General Secretary's Office tries to raise
funds. Raising funds for overseas
studies has been "a tough nut to
crack," Glen explained.
Gertrude Mahrholz, A C-FSP

member and adjunct professor, said
closure of the Berlin campus is "de
plorable. It's a shame that Stanford
couldn't come up with the money
when it was a real bargain."
She said the administration should
"be aware of the importance that stu
dents attach to overseas programs, but
she commended the Overseas Studies
Office for meeting its budget restric
tion by closing only one program.
The Vienna overseas campus can be
expanded easily to absorb some of stu
dent damand for a German language
campus, Mancall said, but increased

competition for spaces will probably
raise the level of language training re
quired.
Mancall said History Prof. Gordon
Craig will continue as a faculty
member at the Free Univesity of Berlin
and graduate study at Berlin wdl con
tinue.
Mancall said Stanford is the major
American educational institution with
a program in Berlin, and "our pre
sence is very important to them." Clos
ing Stanford-in-Berlin "is going to
hurt our image, I'm sure," Mahrholz
said.

hurt our image, I'm sure," Mahrholz
said.
Stanford-in-Berlin will close after
this year "solely for financial reasons",
Director of Overseas Studies Mark
Mancall announced Friday.
"If in the future we can find funds to
reopen Berlin, 1 personally see no
reason we shouldn't reopen Berlin,"
he said.
Berlin offered a very generous rental
arrangement for the Villa Muthesius,
where the campus's classrooms and of
fices are. Mancall said.
But additional annual expenditures
for salaries, transportation and student
subsidies would come to $75,000 to
$HO,OOO per year, and that money is not
available in the budget, Mancall wrote
in a letter to Martin Ouilisch, munici
pal district representative from
Zehlendorf, where the villa is located.
Phil Lane, a student representative
on the Committee for Foreign Studies
Programs (C-FSP) said, "We have
tried, I think, everything." Even Ber
lin's closure will not meet the overseas
studies budget for 1978-79, he said,
but, he added, the budget can be met
without cutting other programs.
"Final budgetary control is with the
Provost's Office," he said.
"Funding will have to be in compet
ition with other new opportunities and
other programs," said Provost William
Miller.
According to Dave Glen, associate
general secretary, proposals for fun
draising projects are cleared by the
provost and given a priority. Then, the
General Secretary's Office tries to raise
funds. Raising funds for overseas
studies has been "a tough nut to
crack," Glen explained.
Gertrude Mahrholz, A C-FSP

member and adjunct professor, said
closure of the Berlin campus is "de
plorable. It's a shame that Stanford
couldn't come up with the money
when it was a real bargain."
She said the administration should
"be aware of the importance that stu
dents attach to overseas programs, but
she commended the Overseas Studies
Office for meeting its budget restric
tion by closing only one program.
The Vienna overseas campus can be
expanded easily to absorb some of stu
dent damand for a German language
campus, Mancall said, but increased

competition for spaces will probably
raise the level of language training re
quired.
Mancall said History Prof. Gordon
Craig will continue as a faculty
member at the Free Univesity of Berlin
and graduate study at Berlin wdl con
tinue.
Mancall said Stanford is the major
American educational institution with
a program in Berlin, and "our pre
sence is very important to them." Clos
ing Stanford-in-Berlin "is going to
hurt our image, I'm sure," Mahrholz
said.
