# Governments can rule DNA research?
## 
### 
Denver (AP) — A law professor told
a group of scientists yesterday that the
U.S. Constitution does not protect
their right to engage in experimental
research and therefore governments
are free to regulate such controversial
projects as recombinant DNA research.
Critics say research on recombinant
DNA could pose biological hazards.
George Washington Prof. Harold
Green told the American Association
for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) that local, state and national
governments are free to pass laws reg
ulating such research without having
to prove constitutionality of the laws.
The discussion was part of a day
long session on scientific freedom and
responsibility at the 143 rd annual
meeting of the AAAS.
Recombinant DNA research in
volves the new technology of artifi
cially transferring genetic material
from one species to another, and re
combining it to produce new inherited
traits.
Some argue this work can be benefi
cial, correcting genetic errors or pro
ducing new drugs. Critics say new and
virulent forms of life could be created
and perhaps escape to the community.
Around the country, many com
munity organizations and states have
sought to regulate recombinant DNA
research. New York State will consider
such laws and a U.S. Senate hearing
will be held soon.
Green, of the National Law Center at
George Washington University, has
been closely involved in the recom
binant DNA debate and is an adviser to
the National Institutes of Health,
which has issued guidelines for such
research.
Green said the constitutional right of
scientific inquiry cannot extend
beyond freedom of speech, and that
the critical distinction is between
speech and action.
"Surely a scientist has the freedom
to think, to do calculations, to write, to
speak and to publish," he explained.
"When, however, the scientist
leaves the area of such abstractions
and turns to experimentation, he
moves within the range of action that
may enjoy only some, or perhaps very
little or no, constitutional protection."
"Speech emanating from the vocal
cords is generally fully protected, but
amplified speech is not; one is con
stitutionally protected in cursing the
flag or a draft card, but he is not pro
tected when he rips or tears it. . . ."
Current thinking in the courts,
Green said, is that they will not "sec
ond guess" legislatures on regulation
where there is no constitutional limita
tion on government power.
"Thus, there has never been any
doubt in my mind that a city's prohibi

tion against recombinant DNA
molecule experimentation within city
limits does not violate any constitu
tionally protected right of scientific
inquiry where the city may rationally
— even though perhaps not reasonably
— have believed that such experi
ments might endanger the health and
safety of the public," he said.
