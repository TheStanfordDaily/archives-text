If the Board of Trustees approves the
Willow Road widening project, the
plan will have cleared its final hurdle.
Last week the Palo Alto City Council
approved project recommendations
made by an ad hoc committee of Menlo
Park, Palo Alto and Universiy rep
resentatives.
The Menlo Park City Council has al
ready approved the plan.
The project will widen Willow Road
(to be renamed Sand Hill Road) from
the Sand Hill Road-Santa Cruz Ave.
intersection to Arboretum Drive in
Palo Alto, and add a new section of
road through the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Of the 11 recommendations made,
four were of particular importance to
Menlo Park residents next to the new,
wider road.
First, the residents wanted no de
velopment on a three-acre parcel
which will be left between the new
road and San Francisquito Creek next
to the shopping center. To prevent de
velopment, Palo Alto council mem
bers supported acquiring the land for
$250,000 and leaving it vacant.
Second, Menlo Park residents
sought and received a promise from
the University that they will be con
sulted about any future development
on a 45-acre parcel adjacent to the
Children's Hospital.
Third, a minimum setback of 90 feet
for any development on that land was
agreed upon.
Fourth, the University agreed to ex
tend Campus Drive from the Medical
Center to Junipero Serra if traffic sur
veys show this to be necessary.
After all parties concerned approve
the recommendations, the next step
will be the formation of an assessment
district by Palo Alto. Menlo Park and
San Mateo County will finance the sec
tion of the road outside Palo Alto.
