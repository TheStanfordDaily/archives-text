THEATRE IN ENGLAND
Aug. 7 to Aug. 28, Sept. 4 or Sept. 18
Three, four or six weeks, your choice:
three weeks for the course, one or three
weeks for independent travel if you wish.
Six units of academic credit (can be transferred
to any institution; or the course can be taken
simply for pleasure).
Twelve great plays in London, Chichester and
Stratford by playwrights from Shakespeare
to Stoppard.
Distinguished actors and directors as your
guests: both in class and in the pub you meet
with members of the Royal Shakespeare Co.
and the National Theatre Company.
Plenty of free time for visits to castles and the
countryside (this is not a tour, you are not
herded about).
Two teachers: Dr. Stanley Glenn, Director of
Theatre, UCSB; and Dr. Homer Swander,
Director of the Institute of Renaissance
Studies, Oregon Shakespearean Festival.
For information, write Dr. Swander, Dept. of
English, UC Santa Barbara, 93106.
