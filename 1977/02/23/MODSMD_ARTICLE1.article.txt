# Constitutionality questioned
## State textbook loans challenged 
### Jordan Lorence 
The California Teachers' Associa
tion (CTA) and the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) are suing the
state, challenging the constitutionality
of the state's textbook loan program to
private school students. The action
comes amid accusations that the CTA
is trying to run private schools out of
business.
The program loans textbooks and
other instructional materials to non
profit private schools. The state gives
each school a credit of about $8 for
every student in grades K-12. The
school may then use these credits to
buy government-approved textbooks
from the state. The program will cost
about $2 million and involve almost
250,000 students this year.
On Jan. 19, the California Superior
Court in Los Angeles County upheld
the constitutionality of the state prog
ram. The CTA and the ACLU will ap
peal the decision, according to their
lawyers.
Although many of the private
schools participating in the loan prog
ram are parochial schools, some say
this case involves more than the sep
aration of church and state.
"The CTA is trying to save jobs for
its teachers," said Father Mike Mitch
ell, assistant superintendent of
schools-fiscal affairs for the Catholic
Archdiocese of San Francisco.
"Fewer students are entering public
schools because of the declining birth
rate," said Mitchell. "The teachers'un
ions know there would be more job
security for their teachers if the private
schools closed down and sent their
students to public schools."
Joseph McElligott, director of the
Division of Education for the Califor
nia Catholic Conference, said that
many CTA members are presently un
employed while private school en
rollments are increasing.

Because of these factors, he said, the
CTA now opposes any form of state aid
to parochial schools "because it means
less money in the public schools and
less grist for the bargaining tables."
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett (D-
Redwood City), vice chairman of the
Assembly Education Committee, said
this might be true. He said the CTA's
involvement in the lawsuit is "quizzi
cal." Usually, parents will bring such
lawsuits, not teachers' organizations,
he said.
Arnett added that the CTA has op
posed private school aid bills only re
cently.

McElligott said that "there is proba
bly no official policy of the CTA to try
to close private schools, but CTA
members have told me in conversa
tions that this is exactly what they are
trying to do."
Peter Galiano, the lawyer for the
CTA in this case, denied that the CTA
has such motives.
"The state doesn't have enough
money to support its public schools as
it is," Caliano said. "Their quality is
further diluted when state money is
given to private schools.
