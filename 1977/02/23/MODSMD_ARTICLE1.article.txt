# Constitutionality questioned
## State textbook loans challenged 
### Jordan Lorence 
The California Teachers' Associa
tion (CTA) and the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) are suing the
state, challenging the constitutionality
of the state's textbook loan program to
private school students. The action
comes amid accusations that the CTA
is trying to run private schools out of
business.
The program loans textbooks and
other instructional materials to non
profit private schools. The state gives
each school a credit of about $8 for
every student in grades K-12. The
school may then use these credits to
buy government-approved textbooks
from the state. The program will cost
about $2 million and involve almost
250,000 students this year.
On Jan. 19, the California Superior
Court in Los Angeles County upheld
the constitutionality of the state prog
ram. The CTA and the ACLU will ap
peal the decision, according to their
lawyers.
Although many of the private
schools participating in the loan prog
ram are parochial schools, some say
this case involves more than the sep
aration of church and state.
"The CTA is trying to save jobs for
its teachers," said Father Mike Mitch
ell, assistant superintendent of
schools-fiscal affairs for the Catholic
Archdiocese of San Francisco.
"Fewer students are entering public
schools because of the declining birth
rate," said Mitchell. "The teachers'un
ions know there would be more job
security for their teachers if the private
schools closed down and sent their
students to public schools."
Joseph McElligott, director of the
Division of Education for the Califor
nia Catholic Conference, said that
many CTA members are presently un
employed while private school en
rollments are increasing.

Because of these factors, he said, the
CTA now opposes any form of state aid
to parochial schools "because it means
less money in the public schools and
less grist for the bargaining tables."
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett (D-
Redwood City), vice chairman of the
Assembly Education Committee, said
this might be true. He said the CTA's
involvement in the lawsuit is "quizzi
cal." Usually, parents will bring such
lawsuits, not teachers' organizations,
he said.
Arnett added that the CTA has op
posed private school aid bills only re
cently.

McElligott said that "there is proba
bly no official policy of the CTA to try
to close private schools, but CTA
members have told me in conversa
tions that this is exactly what they are
trying to do."
Peter Galiano, the lawyer for the
CTA in this case, denied that the CTA
has such motives.
"The state doesn't have enough
money to support its public schools as
it is," Caliano said. "Their quality is
further diluted when state money is
given to private schools.

have every right to run their own
schools, but they should be able to
support them without asking for help
from the taxpayers."
NlcElligott said that without such
aid, the state would deny poor and
minority families the right to choose a
value-oriented education.
"Catholic schools have a higher per
centage of minority students than pub
lic schools do. If parents have to spend,
say $11 more a year for each one of
their children in parochial schools,
they might not be able to afford to send
them there," said McElligott.
"If this law is declared unconstitu
tional," he said, "it won't close down
the Catholic schools, but it will dis
courage poor and minority families
from sending their children to paroc
hial schools."
'Bargain*
It is "a bargain" for the state to grant
some aid to private schools, he added.
If private schools closed down, he
said, the state would have to foot the
entire cost of educating the added stu
dents.
This line of reasoning ignores the
constitutional questions, according to
Galiano.
"There is a question of separation of
church and state here," said Galiano.
He said that the First Amendment of
the Constitution forbids the govern
ment from aiding churches in this
manner. Even if this program is legal
under the federal constitution, as some
contend, it certainly is not legal under
the more restrictive California con
stitution, he said.
He explained that the U.S. Supreme
Court has allowed aid programs to
parochial students, but has forbidden
the state toaid church schools directly.
In one of his trial briefs, Galiano said

it is a "sham and a subterfuge" to say
that the churches were not being aided
by the textbook loan program to stu
dents. The schools administer the
program for the students, select and
store the books, receive the books from
the state, and even keep the books for
future use, he said. The church school,
be argued, is the main benefactor of
this program.
The CTA and the ACLU also argue
that because religious and nonreligi
ous training are closely intertwined at
parochial schools, the state cannot
help but aid the teaching of religion
with this program.

Roger Wolfertz, an attorney for the
state Department of Education, said
that administering the program
through the schools and not through

the students was an "administrative
convenience and nothing more."
Wolfertz said the U.S. Supreme
Court has upheld the constitutionality
of state textbook loan programs to pri
vate schools in the past.
He also said that the state constitu
tion allows indirect aid to churches,
but not direct aid. Because the church
schools receive no money from the
state, there is no direct aid here.
Judge Ernest Zack, who presided
over the case, said in his opinion that
both the state and federal constitutions
allow some aid to churches.
Although the concept of textbook
loans to parochial students is constitu
tional, Zack said, the state's practice of
administering the system through the
church schools may not be. The state
law does not mandate the present form

Joseph McElligott, director of the
Division of Education for the Califor

many CTA members are presently un
employed while private school en
rollments are increasing.

Because of these factors, he said, the
CTA now opposes any form of state aid
to parochial schools "because it means
less money in the public schools and
less grist for the bargaining tables."
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett (D-
Redwood City), vice chairman of the
Assembly Education Committee, said
this might be true. He said the CTA's
involvement in the lawsuit is "quizzi

he said.

cently.

McElligott said that "there is proba

trying to do."
Peter Galiano, the lawyer for the
CTA in this case, denied that the CTA
has such motives.
"The state doesn't have enough
money to support its public schools as
it is," Caliano said. "Their quality is
further diluted when state money is

NlcElligott said that without such

"Catholic schools have a higher per

say $11 more a year for each one of
their children in parochial schools,
they might not be able to afford to send
them there," said McElligott.

It is "a bargain" for the state to grant
some aid to private schools, he added.
If private schools closed down, he
said, the state would have to foot the
entire cost of educating the added stu

This line of reasoning ignores the
constitutional questions, according to
Galiano.
"There is a question of separation of
church and state here," said Galiano.
He said that the First Amendment of
the Constitution forbids the govern
ment from aiding churches in this
manner. Even if this program is legal
under the federal constitution, as some
contend, it certainly is not legal under
the more restrictive California con
stitution, he said.
He explained that the U.S. Supreme
Court has allowed aid programs to
parochial students, but has forbidden
the state toaid church schools directly.
In one of his trial briefs, Galiano said

it is a "sham and a subterfuge" to say
that the churches were not being aided
by the textbook loan program to stu
dents. The schools administer the
program for the students, select and
store the books, receive the books from
the state, and even keep the books for
future use, he said. The church school,
be argued, is the main benefactor of
this program.
The CTA and the ACLU also argue
that because religious and nonreligi

parochial schools, the state cannot
help but aid the teaching of religion
with this program.

Roger Wolfertz, an attorney for the
state Department of Education, said
that administering the program
through the schools and not through

convenience and nothing more."
Wolfertz said the U.S. Supreme

of state textbook loan programs to pri

He also said that the state constitu
tion allows indirect aid to churches,

schools receive no money from the
state, there is no direct aid here.
Judge Ernest Zack, who presided

both the state and federal constitutions

The program loans textbooks and

have every right to run their own
schools, but they should be able to
support them without asking for help
from the taxpayers."
NlcElligott said that without such
aid, the state would deny poor and
minority families the right to choose a
value-oriented education.
"Catholic schools have a higher per
centage of minority students than pub
lic schools do. If parents have to spend,
say $11 more a year for each one of
their children in parochial schools,
they might not be able to afford to send
them there," said McElligott.
"If this law is declared unconstitu
tional," he said, "it won't close down
the Catholic schools, but it will dis
courage poor and minority families
from sending their children to paroc
hial schools."
'Bargain*
It is "a bargain" for the state to grant
some aid to private schools, he added.
If private schools closed down, he
said, the state would have to foot the
entire cost of educating the added stu
dents.
This line of reasoning ignores the
constitutional questions, according to
Galiano.
"There is a question of separation of
church and state here," said Galiano.
He said that the First Amendment of
the Constitution forbids the govern
ment from aiding churches in this
manner. Even if this program is legal
under the federal constitution, as some
contend, it certainly is not legal under
the more restrictive California con
stitution, he said.
He explained that the U.S. Supreme
Court has allowed aid programs to
parochial students, but has forbidden
the state toaid church schools directly.
In one of his trial briefs, Galiano said

it is a "sham and a subterfuge" to say
that the churches were not being aided
by the textbook loan program to stu
dents. The schools administer the
program for the students, select and
store the books, receive the books from
the state, and even keep the books for
future use, he said. The church school,
be argued, is the main benefactor of
this program.
The CTA and the ACLU also argue
that because religious and nonreligi
ous training are closely intertwined at
parochial schools, the state cannot
help but aid the teaching of religion
with this program.
Convenience
Roger Wolfertz, an attorney for the
state Department of Education, said
that administering the program
through the schools and not through

the students was an "administrative
convenience and nothing more."
Wolfertz said the U.S. Supreme
Court has upheld the constitutionality
of state textbook loan programs to pri
vate schools in the past.
He also said that the state constitu
tion allows indirect aid to churches,
but not direct aid. Because the church
schools receive no money from the
state, there is no direct aid here.
Judge Ernest Zack, who presided
over the case, said in his opinion that
both the state and federal constitutions
allow some aid to churches.
Although the concept of textbook
loans to parochial students is constitu
tional, Zack said, the state's practice of
administering the system through the
church schools may not be. The state
law does not mandate the present form
of administration.
The California Teachers' Associa
tion (CTA) and the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) are suing the
state, challenging the constitutionality
of the state's textbook loan program to
private school students. The action
comes amid accusations that the CTA
is trying to run private schools out of
business.
The program loans textbooks and
other instructional materials to non
profit private schools. The state gives
each school a credit of about $8 for
every student in grades K-12. The
school may then use these credits to
buy government-approved textbooks
from the state. The program will cost
about $2 million and involve almost
250,000 students this year.
On Jan. 19, the California Superior
Court in Los Angeles County upheld
the constitutionality of the state prog
ram. The CTA and the ACLU will ap
peal the decision, according to their
lawyers.
Although many of the private
schools participating in the loan prog
ram are parochial schools, some say
this case involves more than the sep
aration of church and state.
"The CTA is trying to save jobs for
its teachers," said Father Mike Mitch
ell, assistant superintendent of
schools-fiscal affairs for the Catholic
Archdiocese of San Francisco.
"Fewer students are entering public
schools because of the declining birth
rate," said Mitchell. "The teachers'un
ions know there would be more job
security for their teachers if the private
schools closed down and sent their
students to public schools."
Joseph McElligott, director of the
Division of Education for the Califor
nia Catholic Conference, said that
many CTA members are presently un
employed while private school en
rollments are increasing.

Because of these factors, he said, the
CTA now opposes any form of state aid
to parochial schools "because it means
less money in the public schools and
less grist for the bargaining tables."
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett (D-
Redwood City), vice chairman of the
Assembly Education Committee, said
this might be true. He said the CTA's
involvement in the lawsuit is "quizzi
cal." Usually, parents will bring such
lawsuits, not teachers' organizations,
he said.
Arnett added that the CTA has op
posed private school aid bills only re
cently.

McElligott said that "there is proba
bly no official policy of the CTA to try
to close private schools, but CTA
members have told me in conversa
tions that this is exactly what they are
trying to do."
Peter Galiano, the lawyer for the
CTA in this case, denied that the CTA
has such motives.
"The state doesn't have enough
money to support its public schools as
it is," Caliano said. "Their quality is
further diluted when state money is
given to private schools.
