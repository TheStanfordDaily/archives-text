# DNA research risky
##

Hansch et al.

Since the potential risks of con
tinued DNA recombinant research
cannot be quantified (as the dangers lie
in the unknown products) and since
the consequences of the research itself
may be disastrous, it is imminently
crucial that the public initiates
changes to effect competent regulation
of the research and to require proper
investigation of yet unknown dangers.
Furthermore, until such changes
can be implemented, and until the
public at large has had the opportunity
to make an educated decision as to
whether this entire field of research
should continue, the Alliancefor Rad
ical Change (ARC) calls for a complete
moratorium on all recombinant re
search here.
Little effort has been made by the
scientific community to bring the
issue before the public. Ironically,
both the scientific community and the
scientific press praise the few efforts
made by scientists themselves to estab
lish a regulatory system outside their
own labs.
We condemn the unquestioning at
titude of most established scientists
whoglorify the pursuit of knowledge at
any price and who intimidate perhaps
less well established colleagues who
may question the morality of so-called
"pure" science.
We feel that this field of research
requires an urgent concern in that the
very act of research itself poses un
known odds of potentially great harm.
The very nature of the experimenta
tion process transcends "theory" and
actually produces and breeds unique,
unknown, and unpredictable genetic
combinations. Not only do these en
danger the citizenry at large, but,
perhaps more importantly, they en
danger patients in the hospital who are
simultaneously least resistant to infec
tion and also nearest to th<; research.
ARC believes that the
administration-appointed Biohazards
Committee seeks only to protect and
defend University interests which in
clude patents and the profits they will
bring and praise from academic cir
cles. There is no doubt that direct con
flicts of interest exist between the
"regulatory" responsibilities of the
committee and the personal vested in
terests of many members of the same
committee.
The very composition of the
Biohazards Committee reflects its bias.
We note and denounce the complete

omission of any lab technicians who
are potentially the most able to spot
trouble in labs from representation on
the committee.
The administration here has been ir
responsible in dealing with this issue.
As a leading center for research in this
field, the University should call for an
international moratorium until the
public can be granted its full share in
the decision-making process.
ARC believes that the public is intel
ligent enough to use its rightful au
thority to choose competently and not
to trust vested interests. As the public
bears the risks and pays the bills (via
government grants), only the public
should decide whether these research
techniques should be used at all, and
under the regulations.
ARC further suspects that even the
"benefits" of this research will not be
desirable. It seems that perverted ap
plications for "pure" scientific know
ledge will always be contrived by the
military-industrial complex in corres
pondence to the otherwise hailed
power of these new theories.
It is tempting to draw analogies here
to nuclear power and its perversions.
This would only understate, however,
the much more subtle uses to which
genetic technology can be applied.
CIA-implanted pathogens will be cus
tom made to disrupt the human
ecologies of foreign victims of U.S.
oppression, and epidemics will be im
possible to trace back to their sophisti
cated sources. Biological warfare can
be expected to reach nightmarish di
mensions, limited only by the imagi
nation of Pentagon officials.
Therefore, ARC encourages readers
of this to:
1) educate themselves at Lane or
Meyer libraries as to the biological
dangers of continued research and of
the uses of such research;
2) call out for a local moratorium
from the Stanford Administration or
from the Santa Clara County Council;
3) demand that Stanford refrain
from its "full speed ahead" attitude
toward acquiring patent rights;
4) encourage and seek out ways to
implement national and international
moratoriums which must include in
dustrial research;
5) insist upon fulfillment of the
public's right to decide on continued
research.
