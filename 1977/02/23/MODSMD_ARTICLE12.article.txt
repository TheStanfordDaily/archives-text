# The
						saga of Stanford-in-jail
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Arlene Morgan, a Stanford
employe, spends two nights a
week in Palo Alto's North
County Jail.
Susan Nowlis, a secretary
to President Richard Lyman,
and Janet Thompson, a
sophomore engineering stu
dent, also report periodically
to the local jail.
Morgan, Nowlis, and
Thompson are not part-time
prisoners, though. They're
volunteers who enter the
facility to conduct sociology
and art classes.
The program is unusual;
the classes themselves aren't.
The inmates and volunteers
merely gather to talk or draw.
Still, there are a few constant
reminders of the unconven
tional class setting. There is a
numbing sameness in the
prisoners' wardrobe and the
turnover in students is great.
The jail is technically a
holding facility where in
mates are either released after
several months or forwarded
to prisons. Class attendance
by the inmates is optional.
The jail, which has a capac
ity of 60 men, is concealed in
the basement of the North
County Courthouse at 270
Grant Ave. It's entirely possi
ble to go to the courthouse
and feel there isn't a jail
within miles. There are no

telltale mesh-covered win
dows. In fact, there aren't any
windows.
"The men often go for
weeks without seeing the
sun," Morgan, a psychology
research associate, said.
"That's the truth. They don't
know if it's day or night."
"When I bring in a leaf or
tree branch or something
natural to draw," Thompson,
who teaches art, said,
"they're all really happy to
see it. They don't get outside
much.
"That really surprised me,"
he added. "I take things like
that for granted."
The inmates make "some of
the best and some of the
worst" students, Nowlis said,
most of the uncooperative
prisoners are "youngsters,"
as she calls them — between
19 to 21-year-olds.
"The only thing they're
concerned about is 'When do
I get out? When can I party?
When can 1 boogie?' They're
trying to make a rep (reputa
tion). You can tell they're on
their way to prison. They're
useless.
"The others are the best

students. Their minds aren't
cluttered up with factual
stuff," Nowlis said. "They
have nothing to hide behind.
They have nothing but them
selves, which forces them to
be honest. That's what makes
the best students — honesty."
The consensus among the
three volunteers seemed to be
that they have no more dis
ciplinary problems than the
average high school teacher.
"I haven't come across
anyone who said 'I can't
draw,' or 'I'm not going to
draw," Thompson said.
"They put forth an effort. I
haven't had any disciplinary
problems."
Morgan, founder of the
North County Jail course
program, can't say the same.
She once had to cope with a
problem of mysteriously dis-

appearing art supplies.
Morgan picked out one
thief and said to him. "You
bastard — I'm trying to teach
you to paint and you're rip
ping off brushes. If you don't
give them back, I ain't comin'
back here."
Morgan said that after her
tirade, "brushes and pens just
started coming out of every
body's pockets."
"If you make them feel re
sponsible and tell them that's
what you expect," Nowlis
said, "they rise to the occa
sion."
If and when problems arise,
volunteers must handle them
alone. There are no guards in
the classroom.
"I've never felt safer," Mor
gan said. "There are so many
of them (inmates) who
wouldn't hurt me or do any-

thing to jeopardize the prog
ram that, if anybody did, the
rest would jump on him.
"I'm not worried a
bit . .. never have been. Most
of these guys never see any
body who cares about them as
people," she added.
Morgan admitted there was
one incident which made her
feel a little uneasy. Uncharac
teristically, a man was forced
to attend her class.
"The man is sick," Morgan
said. "He shouts obscenities
at women on the street, and
gets thrown in jail for things
like loitering and being a pub
lic nuisance. He has no fam
ily.
"All of a sudden, they (the
jail officials) decide it would
be good for this guy to have a
class in sociology. They take
him out of his cell raging and

literally drag him into the
classroom. He was dirty and
his hair was matted."
Morgan said the man
started pulling out his hair
and eating it.
While the volunteers are
disgusted by the inmates'
plight, Nowlis and Morgan, at
least, are not totally against
the idea of incarceration.
"I'm not a bleeding-heart
liberal," Nowlis said. "Some
of these people I don't want in
my neighborhood. But if
we're going to lock them up,
let's do something to help
them with their problems.
None of this halfway stuff."
One reason the prisoners
have readily accepted the
volunteers is that the inmates
know their visitors have no
t hi ng material to gain by com
ing to the jail.
"The first think the men
want to know," Thompson
said, "is 'Do you get paid for
this? Why are you here?'
They say, 'Well this is Friday
night — you could be doing
something else.' When I tell
them I'm not getting paid,
they just sort of look at
me ..."

Morgan's interest in the
penal system was cultivated
when she audited a class
taught by Psychology Prof.
Philip Zimbardo on the
psychology of imprisonment.
She volunteered to partici
pate in a program of weekly
classes at Soledad State
Prison initiated by the Politi
cal Science Department here.
Morgan was soon asked to
teach sociology at Soledad,
which she did for two years
until the program was sus
pended in December 1973.
With the approval and
sponsorship of Friends Out
side (a San Jose-based service
organization for inmates and
their families), Morgan rees
tablished the program, this
time at the North County Jail.
Thompson, Nowlis, and
Morgan agreed that the in
mates have taught them quite
a bit, too. Nowlis told of a 27-
year-old inmate who has been
in and out of assorted deten
tion centers since he was
nine.
"He was a runaway." Now
lis said. "That was his crime.
What he has taught me is the
strength of human potential.
He has been dehumanized,
run around, and had the shit
beaten out of him by guards.
Yet he continues to be one of
the most beautiful people 1
have ever met."
