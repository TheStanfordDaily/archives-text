American Ballet Theater
Company and the New York City
Ballet are the two most influen
tial ballet companies in New
York (the dance capital of the
world), and ABT will appear at
the Zellerbach Auditorium in
Berkeley from Feb. 28 to
March 6, and at the San Fran
cisco Opera House from March 7
through March 13.
This is the company which
has received a great deal of pub
licity for its policy of adding in
ternational guest stars to its ros
ter of principal dancers. Erik
Bruhn came out of retirement to
dance with them; Martine van
Hamel (a gold medalist at bal
let's "Olympics" in Varna) left
the National Ballet of Canada to
join ABT; Ivan Nagy, who de
fected from the Hungary, and
Baryshnikov and Makarova,
who defected from the Kirov, are
now dancing primarily with
ABT; Rebecca Wright came from
the Joffrey, and Kirkland and
Browne defected from the New
York City Ballet to join this com
pany.
Despite all the international
stars, the majority of the princi
pals are Americans: Cynthia
Gregory, Karena Brock, Fer
nando Bujones, William Carter,

Eleanor d'Antuono, Ted Kivitt,
Terry Orr, Marcos Paredes, John
Prinz, Marianna Tcherkassky,
Clark Tippet, Charles Ward, Sal
lie Wilson, and Gayle Young.
Cynthia Gregory, who trained
in the Los Angeles area and was
once a soloist with the San Fran
cisco Ballet, has been called
America's prima ballerina as
soluta. She left dancing forabout
a year to do, as she put it, all the
things normal people do, like
gardening, cooking, and learn
ing languages, but she is now
back to dancing.
Kristine Elliot (a soloist who
has had plenty of principal
roles), was trained by Richard
Gibson, who now directs the
Pacific Dance Center and teaches
at the San Francisco Ballet Com
pany school, and has guest
taught ballet classes at Stanford.
Terry Orr was with the SF Ballet
and Gayle Young and Charles
Ward are from California.
Tcherkassky, Ward, and Tippet
are the newest principals, but all
of the soloists are potential prin
cipals.
Classics
American Ballet Theater's ec
lectic repertory includes some of
the most enduring nineteenth
century classics, like The Sleep
ing Beauty as well as some rather
unorthodox pieces, such as
Twyla Tharp's Push Comes to
Shove. The Sleeping Beauty will
be offered three times in San
Francisco; the local premiere
will be on March 12. Beauty
(music by Tchaikovsky) was
staged for ABT by the Royal Bal
let's former ballet mistress, Mary
Skeaping, supervised by Sir
Robert Helpmann, and designed
by Oliver Messel. Skeaping has
tried to preserve the traditional

Petipa choreography as much as
possible.
ABT will also present Giselle,
the full-length Romantic classic
that tests the female lead's tech
nical and dramatic abilities.
Another Petipa ballet, La Baya
dere, which Natalia Makarova
specifically set for ABT, will be
performed, as will Les Syl
phides, set by Michel Fokine, the
choreographer. The pas de deux
selections will be of a tradition
ally classical style, and will be
chosen from these three: Le Cor
saire (Petipa/Adam), Don Quix
ote (Petipa/Minkus), and Grand
Pas Classique (Gsivsky/Auber).
ABT's repertory also includes
some ballets that are not all
white tights and pink pointed
shoes. ThreeofGlenTetley'sbal
lets will be presented: Volun
taries (to Poulenc's concerto for
organ, strings, and timpani), Le
Sacre de Printemps (Stravinsky),
and Gemini by Hans Werner

Henze.
ABT will also perform two bal
lets by Anthony Tudor, the mas
ter of psychological nuance and
flowing, phrase-like dancing:
The Leaves Are Fading (music
by Dvorak) and Pillar of Fire, to
Snoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht.
Kenneth MacMillan is Concerto
to Shostakovich's Concerto No.
2, Opus 102 will be performed.
American themes
Four works with American
themes are especially interest
ing: Billy the Kid, choreog
raphed by Eugene Loring to an
original score by Aaron Cop
land; Rodeo, choreographed by
Agnes deMille to a score com
posed for the ballet by Aaron
Copland, Fancy Free, ABT's
"trademark," choreographed by
Jerome Robbins, with music
composed by Leonard Bernstein,
and finally, Twyla Tharp's
highly acclaimed Push Comes to
Shove.

Cynthia Gregory, who trained
in the Los Angeles area and was
once a soloist with the San Fran
cisco Ballet, has been called
America's prima ballerina as
soluta. She left dancing forabout
a year to do, as she put it, all the
things normal people do, like
gardening, cooking, and learn
ing languages, but she is now
back to dancing.
Kristine Elliot (a soloist who
has had plenty of principal
roles), was trained by Richard
Gibson, who now directs the
Pacific Dance Center and teaches
at the San Francisco Ballet Com
pany school, and has guest
taught ballet classes at Stanford.
Terry Orr was with the SF Ballet
and Gayle Young and Charles
Ward are from California.
Tcherkassky, Ward, and Tippet
are the newest principals, but all
of the soloists are potential prin
cipals.
Classics
American Ballet Theater's ec
lectic repertory includes some of
the most enduring nineteenth
century classics, like The Sleep
ing Beauty as well as some rather
unorthodox pieces, such as
Twyla Tharp's Push Comes to
Shove. The Sleeping Beauty will
be offered three times in San
Francisco; the local premiere
will be on March 12. Beauty
(music by Tchaikovsky) was
staged for ABT by the Royal Bal
let's former ballet mistress, Mary
Skeaping, supervised by Sir
Robert Helpmann, and designed
by Oliver Messel. Skeaping has
tried to preserve the traditional

Petipa choreography as much as
possible.
ABT will also present Giselle,
the full-length Romantic classic
that tests the female lead's tech
nical and dramatic abilities.
Another Petipa ballet, La Baya
dere, which Natalia Makarova
specifically set for ABT, will be
performed, as will Les Syl
phides, set by Michel Fokine, the
choreographer. The pas de deux
selections will be of a tradition
ally classical style, and will be
chosen from these three: Le Cor
saire (Petipa/Adam), Don Quix
ote (Petipa/Minkus), and Grand
Pas Classique (Gsivsky/Auber).
ABT's repertory also includes
some ballets that are not all
white tights and pink pointed
shoes. ThreeofGlenTetley'sbal
lets will be presented: Volun
taries (to Poulenc's concerto for
organ, strings, and timpani), Le
Sacre de Printemps (Stravinsky),
and Gemini by Hans Werner

Henze.
ABT will also perform two bal
lets by Anthony Tudor, the mas
ter of psychological nuance and
flowing, phrase-like dancing:
The Leaves Are Fading (music
by Dvorak) and Pillar of Fire, to
Snoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht.
Kenneth MacMillan is Concerto
to Shostakovich's Concerto No.
2, Opus 102 will be performed.
American themes
Four works with American
themes are especially interest
ing: Billy the Kid, choreog
raphed by Eugene Loring to an
original score by Aaron Cop
land; Rodeo, choreographed by
Agnes deMille to a score com
posed for the ballet by Aaron
Copland, Fancy Free, ABT's
"trademark," choreographed by
Jerome Robbins, with music
composed by Leonard Bernstein,
and finally, Twyla Tharp's
highly acclaimed Push Comes to
Shove.

American Ballet Theater
Company and the New York City

This is the company which
has received a great deal of pub

let's "Olympics" in Varna) left
the National Ballet of Canada to
join ABT; Ivan Nagy, who de
fected from the Hungary, and
Baryshnikov and Makarova,
who defected from the Kirov, are
now dancing primarily with
ABT; Rebecca Wright came from
the Joffrey, and Kirkland and
Browne defected from the New

Twyla Tharp's Push Comes to
Shove. The Sleeping Beauty will
be offered three times in San
Francisco; the local premiere
will be on March 12. Beauty
(music by Tchaikovsky) was
staged for ABT by the Royal Bal
let's former ballet mistress, Mary
Skeaping, supervised by Sir
Robert Helpmann, and designed
by Oliver Messel. Skeaping has
tried to preserve the traditional

Petipa choreography as much as
possible.
ABT will also present Giselle,
the full-length Romantic classic
that tests the female lead's tech
nical and dramatic abilities.
Another Petipa ballet, La Baya
dere, which Natalia Makarova
specifically set for ABT, will be
performed, as will Les Syl
phides, set by Michel Fokine, the
choreographer. The pas de deux
selections will be of a tradition
ally classical style, and will be
chosen from these three: Le Cor
saire (Petipa/Adam), Don Quix
ote (Petipa/Minkus), and Grand
Pas Classique (Gsivsky/Auber).
ABT's repertory also includes
some ballets that are not all
white tights and pink pointed
shoes. ThreeofGlenTetley'sbal
lets will be presented: Volun
taries (to Poulenc's concerto for
organ, strings, and timpani), Le
Sacre de Printemps (Stravinsky),
and Gemini by Hans Werner

Henze.
ABT will also perform two bal
lets by Anthony Tudor, the mas
ter of psychological nuance and
flowing, phrase-like dancing:
The Leaves Are Fading (music
by Dvorak) and Pillar of Fire, to
Snoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht.
Kenneth MacMillan is Concerto
to Shostakovich's Concerto No.
2, Opus 102 will be performed.

American Ballet Theater
Company and the New York City
Ballet are the two most influen
tial ballet companies in New
York (the dance capital of the
world), and ABT will appear at
the Zellerbach Auditorium in
Berkeley from Feb. 28 to
March 6, and at the San Fran
cisco Opera House from March 7
through March 13.
This is the company which
has received a great deal of pub
licity for its policy of adding in
ternational guest stars to its ros
ter of principal dancers. Erik
Bruhn came out of retirement to
dance with them; Martine van
Hamel (a gold medalist at bal
let's "Olympics" in Varna) left
the National Ballet of Canada to
join ABT; Ivan Nagy, who de
fected from the Hungary, and
Baryshnikov and Makarova,
who defected from the Kirov, are
now dancing primarily with
ABT; Rebecca Wright came from
the Joffrey, and Kirkland and
Browne defected from the New
York City Ballet to join this com
pany.
Despite all the international
stars, the majority of the princi
pals are Americans: Cynthia
Gregory, Karena Brock, Fer
nando Bujones, William Carter,

Eleanor d'Antuono, Ted Kivitt,
Terry Orr, Marcos Paredes, John
Prinz, Marianna Tcherkassky,
Clark Tippet, Charles Ward, Sal
lie Wilson, and Gayle Young.
Cynthia Gregory, who trained
in the Los Angeles area and was
once a soloist with the San Fran
cisco Ballet, has been called
America's prima ballerina as
soluta. She left dancing forabout
a year to do, as she put it, all the
things normal people do, like
gardening, cooking, and learn
ing languages, but she is now
back to dancing.
Kristine Elliot (a soloist who
has had plenty of principal
roles), was trained by Richard
Gibson, who now directs the
Pacific Dance Center and teaches
at the San Francisco Ballet Com
pany school, and has guest
taught ballet classes at Stanford.
Terry Orr was with the SF Ballet
and Gayle Young and Charles
Ward are from California.
Tcherkassky, Ward, and Tippet
are the newest principals, but all
of the soloists are potential prin
cipals.
Classics
