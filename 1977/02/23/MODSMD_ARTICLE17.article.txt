## Composer conducts 
### 
Witnessing a composer con
duct his own works is almost in
evitably exhilerating experi
ence, and Tuesday night's Glee
Club concert was no exception.
Directed by Robert MacKinnon
and accompanied by members of
the Stanford Chamber Orchestra,
the Glee Club presented their
classical music debut featuring
the works of Henry Purcell and
Robert MacKinnon.
Henry Purcell, English master
of the early Baroque, is invari
ably left out by those who com
pile lists of the "great" compos
ers, yet many of his works are
among the best of his period. Not
least of these is the Ode on St.
Cecilia's Day (1692), one of a
half-dozen such works he wrote
for this annual festival honoring
the patron saint of music.
This hour-long work, written
as a 15-part suite, featured five
vocal soloists. Although none
had an outstanding voice, they
all sang with an airy timbre well
suited on Purcell, and due to
their vocal similarities, the vari
ous ensembles were exquisitely
balanced.
The orchestra as a whole was
plagued with minor intonation
problems; however, the trumpet
soloists were excellent, scaling
the different heights of the
Baroque brass part with only a
few slips.
Despite its name, the Ode is a
secular work, written for a festi
val. What was missing in this
performance (besides the Glee
Club itself, which sang only a
few numbers) was the buoyant
the convivial spirit of a celebra
tion.
The drowsy diction of the
chorus, the lack of dynamic con
trast, and MacKinnon's slow
tempo drew a grey cloud of
lethargy around the work that

was mirrored in the audience's
lukewarm reception.
Contrast
MacKinnon's Chamber Can
tata (1953) was a brilliant and
exciting contrast. Inspired by his
own work, MacKinnon con
ducted with energetic accuracy,
drawing the whole work along
with him.
The Glee Club chorus, un
hampered by soloists, re
sponded with a spirited and sen
sitive rendition. Their even ba
lance and clear enunciation
added much to the performance.
TheChamberCanfata consists
of seven poems on religion and
nature, set to music. The work is
eclectic, employing a wide vari
ety of musical techniques to il
lustrate the bitonality to an effec
tive use of fairly traditional har
monies. Rhythmically speaking,
sections in 5/4, reminiscent of an
Appalachian folktune, appear
beside the pulsating portentious
prowl of a tiger. The work starts
with a smattering of harsh Hin
demithian chords over an
ethereal string background, and
ends with a climactic theme in
the major.
Uneven
Like most works of such vari
ety, it is somewhat uneven and
some sections do not quite live
up to the profound lyrics, but the
different movements hang to
gether remarkably well. The
pieces was impressive (particu
larly as a student composition),
and the message was moving.
The orchestra responded
supurbly to MacKinnon's inci
sive baton, notably the winds,
which interpreted the poignant
chords and wide intervals of the
Cantata accurately. Especially
inspiring was the Glee Club,
which adapted to their new
genre with the utmost of good
taste.
