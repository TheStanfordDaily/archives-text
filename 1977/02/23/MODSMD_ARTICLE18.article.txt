## 'Wizards': future fantasy 
### 
"To drag out the old cliches,
today's audiences have become
too sophisticated to accept lep
rechuans, dwarves, witches, and
other such outdated
phenomena."—from my review
ofKingKong in theDaily Jan. 4.
For those of you who have
been insisting all this time that I
haven't the vaguest idea of what
I'm talking about, you have
Ralph Bakshi to thank for prov
ing you right. The director ot
such animated features as Frit/.
The Cut, Heavy Traffic and
Coonskin has delivered unto us
the $4 million futuristic anima

tion extravaganza, Wizards,
which has been met with thun
derous approval at college cam
puses across the country.
Wizards, contrary to my pro
nouncement of last month, is
populated with dwarves, fairies,
elves and other such so-called
'outdated phenomena'—"the
true ancestors of man," as the
film refers to those who practice
magic. At war with these forces
of magic millions of years from
now are t he forces of technology,
as espoused by beings mutated
by radioactivity.

Commanding each of these
two factions are two brothers —
Avatar, the cigar-smoking
dwarf, and Blackwolf, the mut
ant. Blackwolf has vowed to
conquer Avatar's kingdom with
his mutant army, using old Nazi
propaganda footage to incense
the otherwise unmotivated mut
ants.
Wizards is simultaneously a
parody and a homage to the
ephemeral world of magic and
cartoons. Bakshi, who also wrote
and produced it, seems at times
to be taking potshots in every di
rection, even at his own side. He
said in a recent interview that his
intent was to entertain, but he
achieves far more.
First of all, Wizards is a beauti
ful film. The animation is so
meticiously constructed that it
makes us realize what ridiculous
sloppiness we've been watching
on Saturday mornings.
Secondly, the buried message
speaks of power and the thirst for
it. Blackwolf's propaganda
weapon, used after he discovers
an old film projector, is dually
appropriate. Not only is Bakshi
warning that usurpers of power
like the Nazis will always be
with us and thus must be
scrutinized before their rise to
power, he is also subtly paying
homage to his medium.
Film, he is saying, is immortal.
It will be here long after we have
all perished. It delivers and pre
serves time unlike any other in
vention ever conceived. But
Bakshi's tribute is secondary to
the plot.
Although it is sometimes mar
red by its lendency to machine
gun everything it loves Wizards
is overall a stunningly original
fantasy vision of the final strug
gle between good and evil.
