## Paxton returns 
### 
Too often, performers who
have been around awhile are car
ried through their present-day
appearances on waves of nostal
gia. Last Thursday night's per
formance by Tom Paxton, vete
ran of the early '60's folk-protest
movement in Greenwich Vil
lage, could have easily faded
into the past in just that manner.
But what Paxton offered the
audience in The Great American
Music Hall was intrinsically en
joyable. He did weave some
older songs into the set, but they
worked well not because of what
they were 15 years ago, but be
cause of what they are now.
Paxton began his set with two
rather serious and lyrically mov
ing love songs. It was a type of
greeting to his audience — a
wish, as he sang in the opener,
that "Love may be yours
forever." He was wooing the au
dience, and it worked. After the
opening two songs, the crowd
was his.

He then proceeded into a
number of protest songs, al
though there was much more to
them than simple protest. He
used humor to great advantage
in a song of the recession, dedi
cated to Gerald Ford, entitled
"You Can Eat Dog Food."
The highlight of the evening
came when he sang a pair of
songs which, though not actu
ally dedicated to Paxton's
longtime friend and fellow fol
kie Phil Ochs, seemed to recall
Och's presence.
The first was a haunting rendi
tion of "Mr. Blue," which wasn't
sung with any of the smoothness
of the recorded version. Here it
was spoken — not sung — with
stinging bitterness.
That was followed by another
very angry and moving song of
defiance which enumerated the
affronts to human rights
throughout the world, and poin
tedly claimed, "They're your
peace prize, Dr. K."
