# NLRB issues formal complaint against USE for unfair practices
## 
### Bill Burger 
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has issued a complaint against
United Stanford Employees (USE),
Local 680, Service Employees Interna
tional Union stating that the union
"has restrained and coerced Stanford
employees in the exercise of their right
. . . to refrain from performing or con
tinuing to perform any obligation of
membership in (the Union)."
The NLRB filed the complaint Feb. 9
and set an April 12 hearing date to
review the situation.
The complaint by the NLRB stems
from an unfair labor practices charge
filed by the University against USE last
April and amended on Jan. 24, 1977.
The complaint charges the union:
—issued notices to newly hired
employes "demanding or requiring
them to join and become full members
of (the union)."
—"maintained a grievance against
Stanford seeking to require employe
Charles Ha'l to become a full member

of (the union)."
—"refused to permit employes
Jimmy Cabading and Richard Haff to
resign from full membership in (the
union)" on Aug. 20, 1976.
—on April 14,1976, sued employes
Charles Hall, Lupe Del Real and Ed
Bartel, "seeking to compel (them) to
become full members of (the union)."
The suit in April against Hall. Del
Real and Bartel sought $50 in compen
satory damages (an amount equivalent
to the union initiation fee) plus ac
cumulated interest, legal expenses and
an order compelling each to sign the
union articles of membership.
USE dropped this suit about 10
months ago but announced it did not
consider the issue dead.
Jim Berk, foimer USE president, said
he is not sure if the NLRB complaint is
intended to attack current USE
policies or whether it is aimed at the
events surrounding the April suit.
According to Douglas Barton,
former University staff counsel, the -

"main thrust" of the NLRB's case is the
suit brought by USE in April against
the three employes. He added that the
NLRB had to discuss the case with
NLRB general counsel in Washington,
D.C., and that this caused a time delay.
Prisci 11 a Wheeler, assistant staff
counsel, said the University is primar
ily concerned with USE's "coercive"
means of forcing workers to join the
union.
Berk said the union has agreed to
stop using any coercive means of forc
ing workers to join the union. But, said
Berk, the union is well within its limits
in requiring new workers to pay the
initiation fees, even if they choose not
to join the union. According to Berk,
the NLRB fully supports this policy.
