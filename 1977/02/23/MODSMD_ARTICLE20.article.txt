## Marat/Sade opens 
### 
Peter Weiss' 1964 play,
Marut/Sude, is actually a play
within a play. The interior play
uses as its foundation an historic
event from the French Revolu
tion: the evening of July 13,
1793, when the Girondist sym
pathizer, Charlotte Corday,
murdered one of the Jacobin
leaders, Jean-Paul Marat.
This interior play is sup
posedly written by the Marquis
de Sade while he was an inmate
at the asylum of Charenton,
where he spent the last several
years of his life. Ironically, al
though Sade did write a number
of plays during his years in
Charenton, a drama concerning
the assassination of Marat was
not among them.
The interior play is not re
stricted to mere historic replica
tion, for Sade added a character
portraying himself, to periodi
cally interupt the action and to
debate the philosophical issues
raised by Marat.
Exterior play
The exterior play is a drama
concerning the production of
Sade's play as performed by the
inmates of Charenton for an au
dience of Parisian dignitaries on
the evening of July 13, 1808,
exactly 15 years after the death of
Marat. To this exterior play addi
tional characters have been ad
ded: Coulmier, the director of
the asylum, who along with his
wife and daughter sits among
the audience, and several guards
and nuns, whose function is to

protect the audience from the
inmates.
These additional characters,
along with the audience, estab
lish the force of the oppression of
the priviledged class over "the
people." The whole play can be
looked upon as an allegory of
oppression in not only the soci
ety of 1808, but also in our own
modern society.
Collage
Neither the exterior nor the in
terior play follow a strict narra
tive pattern. Rather, Murut/Sude
forms a collage, an almost im
pressionistic kaleidoscope oi
ideas, events, and emotions, at
times touching upon the abstract
and even the surreal.
In another critic's words,
Marut/Sude represents "total
theatre," intricately combining
and carefully balancing the ele
ments of literature, drama, and
music toachievea rich and vivid
intellectual and visual experi
ence.
