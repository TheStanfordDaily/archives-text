Congress pleased with larger budget
Washington — President Jimmy Carter asked Congress
yesterday to increase 1978 budget spending by $19.4 billion
more than former President Gerald Ford proposed, and it
appeared from the initial reaction that most lawmakers
approved.
The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Ed
mund Muskie (D-Maine), said Carter's budget proposals
would give the economy a shot in the arm whilealso show
ing "a strong awareness" of the need to keep federal spend
ing under control.
"The administration's budget plan provides for prudent
expansion and continuation of the economic recovery at a
rate consistent with further reductions in the rate of infla
tion," said Muskie, whose committee will strongly influ
ence the final shape of the 1978 budget.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) said it's possi
ble there will be some changes, but predicted, "We will be
in the ball park of what the president wants." He and other
Democratic congressional leaders met with Carter at the
White House.
Carter asked Congress to approve total federal spending
in 1978 of $459.4 billion up from the $440 billion that Ford
had recommended three days before leaving office.
Although that would hike the 1978 budget deficit to
$57.7 billion, $10 billion more than Ford wanted, Senate
Republicans indicated they could live with it and would
not pose a serious challenge.
Senate adds to stimulus program
Washington — The Senate voted yesterday to fatten Pres
ident Jirnrny Carter's economic-stimulus program of tax
cuts and federal spending amid growing opposition to his
proposed $50-per-person tax rebate.
By a vote of 72 to 20, senators added $1.7 billion to the
$15.5-billion stimulus plan recommended by Carter for the
period that ends next Sept. 30.
The vote does not represent an endorsement of Carter's
much-criticized $50-per-person tax rebate; it means only
that if the rebate is approved, the budget will accommodate
it.
The vote was on whether to amend the budget for the

current fiscal year to allow a stimulus package costing up to
$17.2 billion, as recommended by the Senate Budget Com
mittee. The House is expected to vote today on a similar
figure, $1 7.3 billion.
Hunt freed after 31 months in prison
Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. — E. Howard Hunt, the chief
recruiter for the Watergate burglary, walks out of prison
today as a free man for the first time in 31 months.
Hunt, confined in the minimum-security federal prison
here, is being released two days ahead of schedule even
though a trial in which he was to testify has been called off,
prison superintendent Earl Aiken said yesterday.
That will leave G. Gordon Liddy as the only original
Watergate defendant still in prison. He won't be eligible for
parole until May 1, 1981.
Court delays Hongisto's jail sentence
San Francisco — The state Court of Appeals delayed
yesterday the five-day jail sentence of Sheriff Richard Hon
gisto, convicted of contempt of court for refusing to evict
the elderly tenants of the International Hotel.
In a brief one-paragraph order, the appellate court di
rected that the sentences of Hongisto and L'ndersheriff
James Denman be stayed until the court can consider their
appeal.
The order was issued just 15 hours before they were to
have surrendered at the San Mateo County Jail.
