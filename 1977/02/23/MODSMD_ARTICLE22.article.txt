# Ticketing, fees legal
## 
### 
The University's policy of charging parking fees and ticketing violators
has been found "reasonable and orderly" in a unanimous decision of the
first district state court of appeals, third division.
The decision came in an appeal of a class action suit brought Aug. 1,1975
by United Stanford Employees (USE) against the University Board of Trus
tees.
The major contention in USE's appeal dealt with the meaning of section
21113 of the California Vehicle Code. USE said this section "delegates only
the police power to regulate parking, traffic, etc., not the power to impose a
charge which is in the nature of a tax. . .
The court ruled the fee charged for parking is "not a tax at all. . . for no one
is required to pay it." Since the University is private property, "the driver
that parks in violation of the condition imposed by the landowner does not
pay anyone a tax; he may be obligated to pay a fine, which is not allocated to
the landowner but to the appropriate governmental unit."
Anne Schlagenhaft, president of USE, said, because the union had just
been notified of the decision, "we haven't bad time to give (appeal to a
iiigher court) much thought."
