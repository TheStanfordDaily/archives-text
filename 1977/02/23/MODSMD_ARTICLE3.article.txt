# Prof attacks consulting policy
## University too restrictive 
### Randy David News analysis 
The University's new policy on outside consulting is
penalizing professors for over-accomplishment, according
to Arthur Bryson, chairman of the Aeronautics and As
tronautics Department.
The policy, which was accepted by the Faculty Senate on
Feb. 3, restricts professors to 13 days of outside consulting
in their professional fields each quarter, including
weekends.
Recommended by the Committee on Research, the policy
defines outside consulting as "professional activity related
to the person's field or discipline, where a fee for service or
equivalent relationship with a third party exists."
"Engineering professors learn an awful lot from outside
consulting." said Bryson. Allowing professors to moon
light on weekends yet not allowing them to do outside
foolish, he said.
"It is much more beneficial to the professor and the Uni
versity for a professor to consult," Bryson added. Engineer
ing professors have little contact with the world outside
Stanford as it is. he said.
Reacting to abuses
"Obviously, the administration is reacting to the cases of
professors who abused the privilege" of outside consulting.
Bryson said. These professors were paid by two different
sources for doing the same research, he said.
Adopting the new policy to cure the problem of illegal
consulting is "not the right medicine to cure the disease."
Bryson said.
The policy "will not affect me. it's just the principleof the
thing that annovs me." he added. He said there are a lot of

professors who dislike the policy but "don't want to go out
on a limb."
According to Vice Provost for Research William Massy,
who is involved in implementing the policy, "the vast
majority of the faculty understand the reason for the policy
and most realize the need for one." He said the policy has
strong faculty support.
The policy is designed to clarify and formalize previous
practice. In the past, the real means of insuring full-iime
service to the University has been peer pressure, said Biol
ogy Prof. Norman Wessells, chairman of the Committee on
Research. On government-sponsored research, principal
investigators report the proportion of time spent in various
activities, he added.
Little effect
A number of industries in the Palo Alto area said the new
policy would have little effect on them.
Bob Grimm, director of the Corporate Integrated Circuit
Laboratory of Hewlett-Packard, said Stanford consulting
does not have a tremendous impact on Hewlett-Packard.
He said a professor's "primary job is teaching and it is a
reasonable approach to have some restriction on outside
consulting."
Don Rutledge, vice president in charge of administration
at Varian Associates, said, "at this moment, we are not
aware of any problems." A spokesman for Lockheed gave a
similar opinion.
Compliance with the policy by University professors will
be checked by periodic random samples of the faculty,
according to Massy. The amount of efforts in days being
spent will be checked rather than the amount of money
being earned, said Wessells.

consulting is "not the right medicine to cure the disease."
Bryson said.
The policy "will not affect me. it's just the principleof the
thing that annovs me." he added. He said there are a lot of

professors who dislike the policy but "don't want to go out
on a limb."
According to Vice Provost for Research William Massy,
who is involved in implementing the policy, "the vast
majority of the faculty understand the reason for the policy
and most realize the need for one." He said the policy has
strong faculty support.
The policy is designed to clarify and formalize previous
practice. In the past, the real means of insuring full-iime
service to the University has been peer pressure, said Biol
ogy Prof. Norman Wessells, chairman of the Committee on
Research. On government-sponsored research, principal
investigators report the proportion of time spent in various
activities, he added.
Little effect
A number of industries in the Palo Alto area said the new
policy would have little effect on them.
Bob Grimm, director of the Corporate Integrated Circuit
Laboratory of Hewlett-Packard, said Stanford consulting
does not have a tremendous impact on Hewlett-Packard.
He said a professor's "primary job is teaching and it is a
reasonable approach to have some restriction on outside
consulting."
Don Rutledge, vice president in charge of administration
at Varian Associates, said, "at this moment, we are not
aware of any problems." A spokesman for Lockheed gave a
similar opinion.
Compliance with the policy by University professors will
be checked by periodic random samples of the faculty,
according to Massy. The amount of efforts in days being
spent will be checked rather than the amount of money
being earned, said Wessells.
The University's new policy on outside consulting is
penalizing professors for over-accomplishment, according
to Arthur Bryson, chairman of the Aeronautics and As
tronautics Department.
The policy, which was accepted by the Faculty Senate on
Feb. 3, restricts professors to 13 days of outside consulting
in their professional fields each quarter, including
weekends.
Recommended by the Committee on Research, the policy
defines outside consulting as "professional activity related
to the person's field or discipline, where a fee for service or
equivalent relationship with a third party exists."
"Engineering professors learn an awful lot from outside
consulting." said Bryson. Allowing professors to moon
light on weekends yet not allowing them to do outside
foolish, he said.
"It is much more beneficial to the professor and the Uni
versity for a professor to consult," Bryson added. Engineer
ing professors have little contact with the world outside
Stanford as it is. he said.
Reacting to abuses
"Obviously, the administration is reacting to the cases of
professors who abused the privilege" of outside consulting.
Bryson said. These professors were paid by two different
sources for doing the same research, he said.
Adopting the new policy to cure the problem of illegal
consulting is "not the right medicine to cure the disease."
Bryson said.
