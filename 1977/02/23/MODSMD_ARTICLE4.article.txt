# Supreme Court to examine California's Bakke decision
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme
Court said yesterday it will decide if
special school admissions programs
that benefit blacks and other minority
students illegally discriminate against
whites.
The justices voted without comment
to review a decision by the California
Supreme Court that such programs
foster a type of reverse discrimination
and violate the rights of whites to be
treated equally under the law.
Pending the Supreme Court's deci
sion, the University of California will
continue its minority admissions
program, according to IJC President
David Saxon.
How the high court eventually rules
could affect drastically the so-called
affirmative action programs at the UC
schools and in education and business
across the nation.
The case is viewed by many civil
rights advocates as a major test of the
nation's continued commitment to
helping minorities achieve social and
economic equality. But many civil
libertarians oppose such programs,
saying that,discrimination is dis
crimination no matter who feels the
brunt.
Review by court
The UC-Davis Medical School suc
cessfully sought the court's review
after the state Supreme Court struck
down the school's policy of admitting
"special students" — blacks,
Mexican-Americans and native
Americans—over more qualified white
students.
Allan Bakke, a 36-year-old white
civil engineer who twice failed to gain
acceptance into the UC-Davis Med
School, sued the regents in 1974.
He claimed he would have been in
cluded in the 100-student entering
classes of 1973 or 1974 if the school
had not maintained a special admis
sions policy for 16 minority students.
The policy, begun in 1969, was
aimed at benefiting "disadvantaged
citizens," but no white was ever admit
ted under the program.
Bakke invoked the Constitution's
14th Amendment — used to free black
slaves over a century ago — in per

suading the California court that his
equal protection rights were being vio
lated.
Decision never reached
The reverse discrimination issue
came before the Supreme Court two
years ago but a decision on its merits
never was reached.
The court's action apparently leaves
Bakke out in the cold, at least for the
time being.
The state supreme court had ordered
UC regents to admit Bakke next fall,
but the Supreme Court postponed the
effect of the California order pending
appeal.
Unless the justices take extraordi
nary measures to speed up considera
tion of the case, it won't be argued
until next fall at the earliest. That
means Bakke probably won't be a
member of the 1977 entering class.
Meanwhile, instructions issued to
the nine UC campuses told adminis
trators to continue "affirmative con

sideration of minority race or ethnic
origin where appropriate."
Pursuing the appeal
Saxon said he welcomed the high
court's decision to review the case, ad
ding UC would vigorously pursue the
appeal because "the best professional
education must remain available in
fact to those of every race, creed, sex
and color."
"This nation has yet to fulfill the
promise in the Declaration of Inde
pendence of equal opportunity for
all," Saxon said.
"Few issues of modern times are
more in need of the authoritive resolu
tion that only the Supreme Court of the
United States can supply," he added.
"The special admission program of
the University of California Medical
School at Davis is an effort to confront
the problems created by a society that
tolerated human slavery but little more
than 100 years ago."
