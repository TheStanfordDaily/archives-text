# Jordan, ZAP chosen as likely theme sites

### Pan Demetrakakes 
A University housing committee
voted 6-0 last night to definitely re
commend Jordan House and tenta
tively recommend ZAP House as loca
tions for two new theme houses. There
was one abstention.
At its meeting, theSubcommittee on
Residences of the Committee on Ser
vices to Students (COSS/R) recom
mended that Jordan be the location if
only one of the two proposed theme
houses is approved. If both the An
drogyny and German Studies houses
are approved, ZAP will also be used
unless another Row house becomes
available.
The subcommittee's report called
the decision on ZAP "agonizing" and
stated:
"(COSS/R) believes that ZAP has
shown excellent management and an
improved house spirit, and is gener
ally a fine place in which to live. Were
there not a shortage of housing spots,
we would recommend continuance of
ZAP.
"However, based on such factors as
draw demand and social and intellec
tual contributions that the house
might make to residents, we found the
alternative to recommending as we did
even less desirable."
Await approval
The two new theme houses, German
Studies and Androgyny, drew a favor
able vote earlier this month from the
Configuration Advisory Panel on
Housing, but still await approval from
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson.
Prior to last night's meeting. COSS/R
had narrowed down to five the number
of houses considered as locations for
the two proposed theme houses. Only
Row and Cowell Cluster houses were
considered, since both of the theme
houses would require their own kitch
ens.
At last night's meeting, representa

tives from each of the five houses (Jor
dan, ZAP, ATO, Whitman and Colum
bae) made statements before the sub
committee and then answered ques
tions.
Jordan RA Lisa Dwyer told the sub
committee, "I feel that Jordan is now
somewhat of a lost cause."
Jordan has suffered poor draw statis
tics in recent years, and six spaces in
the house are currently empty. On this
point, Dwyer said, "Jordan's failure to
fill is ... a sign of what can happen to a
house whose reputation is not ap
preciated by people coming to Stan
ford and of our substandard facilities. 1
think there is a community at Jordan,
but the problem is attracting people to
the house."
ZAP's condition
ZAP residents claimed their house is
not as popular as it might be because of
its poor physical condition. One resi
dent said that ZAP has "the worst
physical plant of any house in the
Cowell Cluster."
When the committee began deliber
ations, it quickly decided to recom
mend choosing Jordan as a theme
house location. Several members con
sidered instituting only one of the two
new theme houses since it was so dif
ficult to choose a second house.
COSS/R Chairman Tim Ferguson
said: "I think we've made a moral
commitment to the two new theme
houses, and we should make room for
both of them."
However, Robinson said: "I'm not
sure they (the advocates of the theme
houses) understand it that way. That
was a recommendation, not a com
mitment. and I don't think we've mis
led them."
The subcommittee left the question
unresolved by making the decision to
replace ZAP with a theme house only
tentative.
