# Stanford Daily Opinions
## Viewpoint Open forum 
### 
About a month ago, I announced in this space the establishment of monthly
open forums to discuss the Daily. At the first of theseforums on Jan. 26 many
constructive criticisms and suggestions were offered. A number of the ideas
expressed, such as more previews of campus attractions and greater coverage of
on-going issues, have already been implemented in this new volume of the
Daily.
We will be holding our second open forum today, at 4:30 p.m., in Meyer
Library Rm. 144. If you are concerned about the quality of the Daily, if you have
any complaints about the Daily, if you have suggestions or criticisms or ideas
which you feel would improve the Daily, please come. We want to hear from you.
As I said last time: you can't be heard unless you make some noise.

Chairman of the Board of
