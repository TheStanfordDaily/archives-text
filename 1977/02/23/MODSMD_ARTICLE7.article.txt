## J.P. Stevens 
### 
During the struggle for civil rights in the 19605, many busines
ses and state and local governments were forced to examine and
evaluate their policies on minority hiring and racial discrimina
tion. Despite gains in affirmative action and minority hiring there
are still pockets of discrimination throughout the nation. Many
involve the rights of minority workers and the right of workers to
organize unions.
Much of the civil protest and activist fervor of the past decade
has gone by the wayside, yet the struggle for the rights of
individuals has continued on a quieter—but perhaps deeper—
level, spearheaded by institutions and groups whose primary
concern is that justice be achieved for all.
The University has before it an opportunity to aid the move
ment for such rights. As a stockholder in the J.P. Stevens Com
pany, the University may affirm its status as a progressive institu
tion by voting for two stockholder proposals which would force
the J.P. Stevens Company to disclose employment and labor prac
tices in its textile mills throughout the South.
Members of the administration will apparently vote in favor of
one proposal, which would require the release of Stevens'
affirmative action and equal employment opportunity figures for
the past three years. However, it appears that they will abstain
from voting on a second proposal which would require the release
of detailed information concerning labor policies and practices.
We believe that the University should express its concern for
minority rights by voting in favor of both measures. The administ
ration has said that the decision to abstain is based in part on a
concern over the economic effects of the proposal on the com
pany. We feel that in this case, economic considerations should
take a back seat to moral responsibility.
In addition, we feel that the University should subject to close
examination the hiring policies of all companies in which the
University holds investments. Without such a policy, Stanford
cannot fully participate in the struggle for human rights.
