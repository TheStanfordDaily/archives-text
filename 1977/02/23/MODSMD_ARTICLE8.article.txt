Just to set the record straight, solar
energy may be good stuff but unfortu
nately it is not as good as the
"payback" figures attributed to me
(Daily Feb. 14) would have you be
lieve.
Neglecting interest charges and
calating costs of natural gas, it would
take about 55 years to recover the cost
of a professionally installed residen
tial solar space heating system in this
area (not the 37 years "quoted").
If we estimate gas prices will in
crease at 15 per cent per year and if
money costs five per cent (after taxes)

then the payback becomos about 19
years (not the 13 years quoted). For
domestic water heating the payback
time is about 16 years and for pool
heating, depending on whether plastic
or copper collectors are used, about
five or eight years.
What is left out of these calculations
is the value to society of deriving
energy from a renewable, nonpollut
ing source and extending the lifetime
of our fossil fuels and the jobs which
are dependent on their availability.
