# Carter's foreign policy: new faces?
## 
### 
A couple of days ago, I overheard
someone say, "Carter's for recycling,
alright. He's recycling the Johnson
Administration." Actually, it is quite
true that in spite of President Carter's
promise that "there will be new faces
in Washington," more than just a
handful of the "old boys" are back,
including some of the architects of the
Vietnam War (Cyrus Vance, for exam
ple).
This should not be surprising. The
circle of those who decide this nation's
foreign policy is a small and elite one.
In the present era, this circle is domi
nated by a not-altogether-above
ground-group called the Trilateral
Commission, or, simply, the
Trilateralists. This column discusses
this group's ties with the Carter Ad
ministration.
The list of the American members of
the Trilateralists comes disturbingly
close to reading like a who's who in the

Carter Administration. Of the approx
imately 65 U.S. members of this
organization, 16 have top-level
positions in the new administration,
and five serve as official advisors.
Among others, the list includes:
Jimmy Carter, president; Walter Mon
dale, vice president; Cyrus Vance, sec
retary of state; Harold Brown, secretary
of defense; W. Michael Blumenthal,
secretary of the treasury; Zbigniew
Brzezinski, head of the National Sec
urity Council; and, according to a re
cent CBS interview with Robert Scheer
of New Times magazine, Andrew
Young, U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
Obviously, for at least the next four
years, the T r ilateralists will have a
great deal to say about the direction of
U.S. foreign policy. Who are they?
Originated around 1972, largely as a
brain-child of multimillionaire
banker, David Rockefeller, the group is

an international organization de
signed to encourage dialogue between
leading political and corporate elites
of North An.erica, Western Europe and
Japan. Hence, the term "trilateral."
The groups meets about once every
nine months, in the U.S., Europe or
-Japan, to discuss matters of common
interest.
Above all, U.S.-based membership

includes multinational business
executives (especially bankers) from
such interests as Chase Manhattan,
Exxon, Coca-Cola, Texas Instruments
and Sears Roebuck; representatives
from various news media, including
officials from (London) Times, CBA,
The New York Times, The Los
Angeles Times, The Chicago Sun-
Times and the columnist Carl Rowan
(former head of the U.S. Information
Agency); intellectuals based at Har
vard, Brookings Institute, MIT, Cal
Tech and other prestigious institu
tions. There are also a handful of rep
resentatives from labor — the AFL
CIO, the United Auto Workers, the
Steel workers Union — and from civic
groups like the League of Women Vot
ers.
The strong connection with the
press is extremely interesting, for, as
one reporter put it, "a consensus is a
consensus in this realm only if the
public knows about it" (Washington
Post, Jan. 16).
The organization and directly re
lated activities are funded by such
sources as David Rockefeller, the Ford
Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers,
the German Marshall Fund, the Lilly
Endowment, Time, Inc., Wells Fargo
and Texas Instruments.
Recently, Prince Bernhard of the
Netherlands has come to the attention
of the U.S. press — as an international
operator who has participated in
arms-trafficking, bribery and other
shady deals involving large multina
tional corporations (e.g., Lockheed)

and millions of dollars. During the last
three decades, the prince has been one
of the most influential actors in the
sphere of international political
economy — not without the assistance
of the C.I. A. and a number of top level
officials in the U.S. government. Pr
ince Bernhard has presided over the
annual, extremely secret sessions of
the Bilderberg Conference — and Bil
derberg is the father of theTrilateralist
Commission.
According to a recent New Times
article,Bilderbert, "has been pivotal in
hammering out a common Cold War
stance between the European and
American corporate and political elite.
Among other things, Bilderberg con
ferences helped to develop a common
outlook on N.A.T.O. problems, trade
issues, O.P.E.C. and detente. They
have been instrumental in determin
ing new structures within which the
elite can extend and flex its power."
Bilderberg is a forum for "heavy
weights" (those recently in attendance
included Gerald Ford, Henry Kis
singer and Rockefeller).
An article in The Washington Post,
by William Greider notes: "the Trilat
eral Commission is an effort to re
establish consensus in the American
foreign-policy community . . . The
new outlook, enunciated by
Brzezinski, does not shut down the
Cold War, but it directs our thinking to
a second front — the demands for
economic justice from the poor and
developing nations, the Third World's
capacity for disrupting the world, not
to mention the advanced industrial
economies."
In a nutshell. Carter's "old faces" in
foreign policy — and there are some
qualified "new faces" —are "liberal"
neocolonialists. Neo-colonialism al
lows for the political "independence,"
but not the economic independence, of
so-called developing nations. They
largely represent the interests of cor
porate and political elites.
We should not, then, expect the
foreign policy of the present administ
ration to be radical in any sense. In
fact, should the actions of Carter's
foreign policy staff go unchecked, it is
likely that they will not make the
world safer for real democracy, but for
corporate, and neo-colonial, interests.
