### Pan Demetrakakes 
The Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS) voted three to one yes
terday to recommend that the Board of
Trustees rescind its 32-year-old banon
sororities. There were three absten
tions.
Two weeks ago, James Lyons, dean
of student affairs, said there is a "very
high likelihood" the University would
seek a repeal of the ban.
After yesterday's vote, Lyons said
the University will urge the trustees to
consider lifting the sorority ban at
their meeting next month, unless there
is no room on the agenda.
All-male frats
Sing said he believed Lyons had
asked the committee to consider the
sorority question because the Univer
sity may be violating a law against sex
discrimination since only all-male
fraternities have subjective selectivity.
Such selectivity entails having pre
sent residents of a house choose their
future living mates.
The sex discrimination statute is
Title IX of the Education Amendments
of 1972.
Committee members said their main
option was either to eliminate subjec
tive selectivity for fraternities or ex
tend it to sororities.
The resolution adopted by the com
mittee read:
'Does not support'
"While the committee does not sup
port the University's endorsing or
maintaining the- principle of subjec
tive selection, p majority of the mem
bers feel that the University has a
long-standing commitment to . . . the
fraternity system; therefore, the Uni
versity should permit a 11-female
sororities rather than eliminate the
all-male fraternities which are now the
only living groups with this charac
teristic."
The committee had debated the
sorority issue for two previous meet
ings. At the meeting last week, Lyons
said:
"1 don't like the possible consequ
ences of either action (banning frater
nities or establishing sororities). . . .
There is a grandfather understanding
of fraternities. It's a point of honor.
That's a heavy burden to carry.
"On the other hand, I'd be very re
luctant to take any step that would re
sult in the expansion of secret exclu
sion housing at Stanford."
Members Bill Sing, George
Brown and Iris Brest voted in favor of
the resolution. Assoc. History Prof.
Barton Bernstein, the committee's
most outspoken critic of the recent be
havior of fraternities, cast the lone dis
senting vote.
Members Michael Wald, Tim Fergu
son and Reggie Mason abstained.
The Board of Trustees banned
sororities in 1944 after a special com

mittee reported that sororities held a
detrimental monopoly on the social
life of female students.
The Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS) voted three to one yes
terday to recommend that the Board of
Trustees rescind its 32-year-old banon
sororities. There were three absten
tions.
Two weeks ago, James Lyons, dean
of student affairs, said there is a "very
high likelihood" the University would
seek a repeal of the ban.
After yesterday's vote, Lyons said
the University will urge the trustees to
consider lifting the sorority ban at
their meeting next month, unless there
is no room on the agenda.
All-male frats
Sing said he believed Lyons had
asked the committee to consider the
sorority question because the Univer
sity may be violating a law against sex
discrimination since only all-male
fraternities have subjective selectivity.
Such selectivity entails having pre
sent residents of a house choose their
future living mates.
The sex discrimination statute is
Title IX of the Education Amendments
of 1972.
Committee members said their main
option was either to eliminate subjec
tive selectivity for fraternities or ex
tend it to sororities.
The resolution adopted by the com
mittee read:
'Does not support'
"While the committee does not sup
port the University's endorsing or
maintaining the- principle of subjec
tive selection, p majority of the mem
bers feel that the University has a
long-standing commitment to . . . the
fraternity system; therefore, the Uni
versity should permit a 11-female
sororities rather than eliminate the
all-male fraternities which are now the
only living groups with this charac
teristic."
The committee had debated the
sorority issue for two previous meet
ings. At the meeting last week, Lyons
said:
"1 don't like the possible consequ
ences of either action (banning frater
nities or establishing sororities). . . .
There is a grandfather understanding
of fraternities. It's a point of honor.
That's a heavy burden to carry.
"On the other hand, I'd be very re
luctant to take any step that would re
sult in the expansion of secret exclu
sion housing at Stanford."
Members Bill Sing, George
Brown and Iris Brest voted in favor of
the resolution. Assoc. History Prof.
Barton Bernstein, the committee's
most outspoken critic of the recent be
havior of fraternities, cast the lone dis
senting vote.
Members Michael Wald, Tim Fergu
son and Reggie Mason abstained.
The Board of Trustees banned
sororities in 1944 after a special com
mittee reported that sororities held a
detrimental monopoly on the social
life of female students.
