# Divorce an easy out
## 
### 
Marriage, as it has been practiced in
this society, is dying. People are still
getting married, but they are also get
ting divorced nearly as frequently.
One of every three marriages in the
United States ends in the courts.
Cohabitation or living together
is on the rise, but it does not equal
marriage, minus an official document.
The primary feature of living together
without marriage is that both partners
know the arrangement can be ended at
any time. "No strings attached" rela
tionships require no legal hassles
when the couple decides to separate.
(A recent California Supreme Court
decision may pave the way for alimony
and child support in these cases.)
Apparently no studies have been
made on the success rate of such rela
tionships, but they seem to have no
greater longevity than legal unions.
Marriages have always been judged
primarily by their length. Life time un
ions were considered successful, par
ticularly if the partners were wil ling to
maintain silence about their problems.
Marital difficulties were usually con
cealed from all but the most intimate
acquaintances of the couple.
"Till death do us part" kept married

people together despite alcoholism,
infidelity, mental incompetence and
physical abuse. To divorce was to
admit personal failure, invite social
censure and traumatize the children
for life.
Women were especially stigmatized
by divorce, being seen as "cheap,"
"fast" and threats to intact marriages.
Confronted by these pressures, the

vast majority of unhappily married
couples remained married — and un
happy.
There are numerous factors con
tributing to the breakdown of marriage
as an institution. Perhaps the most in
fluential of these is the radical disin
tegration of traditional roles. In rural
America, perhaps there was a need for
the inale-as-breadwinner and the
female-as-housewlfe-mother roles. In
technological America, the need no
longer exists. There are very few occu
pations left which require exclusively
male or exclusively female perfor
mance. There are no occupations
(other than male and female prostitu
tion) which require the genitalia of
either sex.
New definitions
Because men and women can inter
changeably perform most modern
work, their lives have been irrevocably
altered. The male no longer can com
mand total authority based on his
wages. The female is no longer con
fined to wearying household
drudgery. The roles by which the sexes
defined themselves are obsolete.
The relationships of men and
women today are no longer based on
how yvell they fulfill their designated
tasks, but on how well they relate to
one another as individuals. Emotional
competence and compatibility are the

required ingredients for today's suc
cessful marriage.
It is in the sphere of emotional com
petence and compatibility that most
modern marriages fail. We have not
been instructed in the art of getting
along with other human beings. Most
of us are hopelessly unaware of our
own needs and goals, so it is no sur
prise that we are also ignorant of the
needs and goals of others. We learn
little or nothing of sharing, loyalty,
compassion or sensitivity. We don't
know how to trace behavioral
symptoms to underlying motivations.
We are unable to analyze ourselves,
which also makes us unable to analyze
another person or the interactions be
tween two individuals which occur in
marriage or co-habitation.
Little incentive
And, when marriages of today are
ended nearly as easily as the prover
bial Moslem "I divorce thee, I divorce
thee, I divorce thee," what encour
agement is there to learning the neces
sary skills for successful personal in
teraction?
The point is not that marriage is
good and divorce is bad, nor is it that
divorces should once again be hard to
obtain. The point is that couples today
prefer divorce to honest efforts to solve
their problems — problems which
generally arise from woeful ignorance
of human motivations and emotional
needs.
Divorce is almost always traumatic
to those involved, whether is it easily
obtained or not. In many cases, it could
be avoided if the couple were commit
ted to solving problems together. As it
is, particularly in living together rela
tionships, the couple breaks up at the
first real sign of trouble.
Once divorced, many people
quickly look around for other partners,
without once considering their own
role in the dissolutions of their mar
riages.
Others decide to remain single.
What happens to them, and to their
children? My next column will
explore the world of the single parent
and her/his children.

Marriage, as it has been practiced in
this society, is dying. People are still
getting married, but they are also get
ting divorced nearly as frequently.
One of every three marriages in the
United States ends in the courts.
Cohabitation or living together
is on the rise, but it does not equal
marriage, minus an official document.
The primary feature of living together
without marriage is that both partners
know the arrangement can be ended at
any time. "No strings attached" rela
tionships require no legal hassles
when the couple decides to separate.
(A recent California Supreme Court
decision may pave the way for alimony
and child support in these cases.)
Apparently no studies have been
made on the success rate of such rela
tionships, but they seem to have no
greater longevity than legal unions.
Marriages have always been judged
primarily by their length. Life time un
ions were considered successful, par
ticularly if the partners were wil ling to
maintain silence about their problems.
Marital difficulties were usually con
cealed from all but the most intimate
acquaintances of the couple.
"Till death do us part" kept married

people together despite alcoholism,
infidelity, mental incompetence and
physical abuse. To divorce was to
admit personal failure, invite social
censure and traumatize the children
for life.
Women were especially stigmatized
by divorce, being seen as "cheap,"
"fast" and threats to intact marriages.
Confronted by these pressures, the

vast majority of unhappily married
couples remained married — and un
happy.
There are numerous factors con
tributing to the breakdown of marriage
as an institution. Perhaps the most in
fluential of these is the radical disin
tegration of traditional roles. In rural
America, perhaps there was a need for
the inale-as-breadwinner and the
female-as-housewlfe-mother roles. In
technological America, the need no
longer exists. There are very few occu
pations left which require exclusively
male or exclusively female perfor
mance. There are no occupations
(other than male and female prostitu
tion) which require the genitalia of
either sex.
New definitions
Because men and women can inter
changeably perform most modern
work, their lives have been irrevocably
altered. The male no longer can com
mand total authority based on his
wages. The female is no longer con
fined to wearying household
drudgery. The roles by which the sexes
defined themselves are obsolete.
The relationships of men and
women today are no longer based on
how yvell they fulfill their designated
tasks, but on how well they relate to
one another as individuals. Emotional
competence and compatibility are the

required ingredients for today's suc
cessful marriage.
It is in the sphere of emotional com
petence and compatibility that most
modern marriages fail. We have not
been instructed in the art of getting
along with other human beings. Most
of us are hopelessly unaware of our
own needs and goals, so it is no sur
prise that we are also ignorant of the
needs and goals of others. We learn
little or nothing of sharing, loyalty,
compassion or sensitivity. We don't
know how to trace behavioral
symptoms to underlying motivations.
We are unable to analyze ourselves,
which also makes us unable to analyze
another person or the interactions be
tween two individuals which occur in
marriage or co-habitation.
Little incentive
And, when marriages of today are
ended nearly as easily as the prover
bial Moslem "I divorce thee, I divorce
thee, I divorce thee," what encour
agement is there to learning the neces
sary skills for successful personal in
teraction?
The point is not that marriage is
good and divorce is bad, nor is it that
divorces should once again be hard to
obtain. The point is that couples today
prefer divorce to honest efforts to solve
their problems — problems which
generally arise from woeful ignorance
of human motivations and emotional
needs.
Divorce is almost always traumatic
to those involved, whether is it easily
obtained or not. In many cases, it could
be avoided if the couple were commit
ted to solving problems together. As it
is, particularly in living together rela
tionships, the couple breaks up at the
first real sign of trouble.
Once divorced, many people
quickly look around for other partners,
without once considering their own
role in the dissolutions of their mar
riages.
Others decide to remain single.
What happens to them, and to their
children? My next column will
explore the world of the single parent
and her/his children.
