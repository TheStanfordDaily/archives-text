The Adventures of Jonathan
Corncob: by Himself; illustra
tions by Murk Livingston; David
H. Clodine, publisher.
Reviewed by James Laffan
Let the delicate shield their
eyes. After nearly 200 years of
being cloaked in obscurity,
Jonathan Corncob is exposing
himself to the reading public
once again.
It is altogether fitting that
Jonathan take this time for his
reappearance, during the Bicen
tennial hoopla commemorating
our glorious Revolution. For
Jonathan is himself, if one be
lieves his moniker any more
than his preposterous adven
tures, a "Loyal American Re
fugee" of that war, and Ameri
can accounts of that noble en
deavor are as hard to come by as
American accounts of Little Big
Horn.
Sadly for the historian, Mr.
Corncob's view of the struggle is
usually a fleeting glance over the
shoulder as he is in the process
of deserting it.
Yes, Jonathan is 100 per cent
American, even if rumor has it
that his author was a British
naval officer. With the idolatry
of Crevecour for this country's
georgic delights, Jonathan be
gins his story with an idyllic
sketch of life at the old homes
tead in Massachusetts, Squat
cock Farm.
There, with his tragically ugly
sisters, Supply and Increase
Corncob, his pious father
Habakkuk and mother Charity
who "bred like a rabbit and
snored all night as loud as the
foreman of a jury on a tedious
trial," Jonathan grows versed in
country ways. One of these,
bundling, when practiced with
(or on) the fertile Miss Desire
Slawbunk, causes him to be
come first a father and then a
hasty exile from his native home.
Jonathan wanders to Boston,
which in the 1770s appears as a
third rate cow town. He watches
as the populace, in rare festive
spirit, tar and feather a merchant
who rescued his tea from the
harbor.
Jonathan is promptly thrown
in jail for spurning some worth
less banknotes of the Continen
tal Congress, but by a stroke of

fortune characteristic to most
picaresques, Jonathan manages
to fly the coop. He heads out to
sea aboard an American
privateer for a distinguished
career of piracy, thievery, whor
ing and drunkenness from Bos
ton to Barbados. In between
these diversions, he is variously
impressed into service on both
the American and British sides
of the Revolution under such
career officers as Captains Quid
and O'Sneak who prove to be as
greedy and craven as their
names suggest.
The patriotic reader might
blanch to consider this a "histor
ical" document. Most of what
Jonathan sees, and duly reports,
is a scene of unmitigated corrup
tion, racism and exploitation.
What's worse is that Jonathan,
rather than stepping back as any
moral author might do and sur
veying the carnage before him,
veritably wallows in his milieu,

taking extreme delight in caning
small children or riding atop his
black mistress in a West Indian
hurricane.
Yet Jonathan is an endearing
bastard and one finds oneself
yearning for more of his raucous
bawdiness after the fragment
breaks off with a promise of
further adventures if his readers
so desire. It is sad to see, for those
too late to compliment him, that
the original London edition of
1787 was printed at the author's
expense and went through no
subsequent editions.
The reason may lie in contem
porary reviews, like the one
which began with a wagging
finger: "Harkee, Mr. Corncob,
leave your indecorums and pre
serve your genuine humor un
polluted by improper lan-,
guage." Easier, alas, for a
leopard to change its spots than
poor Mr. Corncob to become a
genteel citizen.

Enlightenment: Notes for a
Scurrilous Life; by Art Beck; Hed
Hill Press, publisher.
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Enlightenment by Art Beck is a
narrative poem about the life of
Giacomo Casanova. It begins in
Paris in 1757 when Casanova
wins permission from the
French minister of finance to
begin a national lottery, and
ends 41 years later in Bohemia,
shortly before Casanova's death,
as the adventurer is writing his
memoirs while working as a lib
rarian for a local count.
Casanova's History of My Life
is one of the most exciting au
tobiographies ever written. Al
though it was left unfinished at
his death in 1798, this enormous
work tells us as much about 18th
century Europe as any other
book from that period.
Were Casanova not so com
pletely a representative of the
Age of Reason, one would be
tempted to call him a Renais
sance man. Certainly Europe has
produced few men with such
charm, genius and versatility,
Artist and lover
Most importantly Casanova
was a lover. Yet this calling
should not be seen as a con
tradiction to his spiritual nature.
Rather it was its fulfillment. Un
like so many other seducers,
Casanova did not merely make
love to women, he also loved
them with a si ncerity hard to de
scribe. He became involved with
the women he seduced with an
intensity only an artist could
maintain. "Nothing can be
dearer to a thinking man than
life," Casanova wrote in his
memoirs. And what more in
tense way to live than by being in
love?
This romantic side of Casano
va's complex character is what
comes across so well in Art
Beck's impressive, book-length
poem. Enlightenment. The au
thor hasn't lost himself in the
glamour of his subject's adven
tures and has been able to re
create a character deep enough
to do the original justice. Great
seducers are rarely unexcep
tional men. They are often reflec
tive, philosophical and pro
foundly lonely. Beck's Casanova
is not a Hogarthian rake. He is a

gif ted man trying passionately to
lead two lives simultaneously —
the contemplative and the ac
tive.
No experience from either
world is alien to him. He can feel
the most ordinary desires with
an extraordinary passion. After
his famous escape from the
prison of Venetian Inquisition,
Casanova flees to Paris where he
tricks officials into letting him
run a profitable lottery. Delirious
with his successful ruse, he runs
through the streets of Paris:
It
was beginning a light rain. I
could smell garlic, meat roast
ing, bakeries:
1 stumbled into a tavern, sat
down, ordered
wine and fell hopelessly in love
with the life
in every face in the place. The
people were
like an explosion in me. I was
finally part of them
again. I'd survive. Better than
survive. Like all of them 1
was born to be rich.
But Beck has created another
character just as fascinating and
even more original than
Casanova, a nun, Maria Mad
delena. While she is an impor
tant character in Casanova's
memoirs, Beck gives her a depth
and personality only hinted at in
the original. Imprisoned in a
convent after her affair with
Casanova is discovered, her let
ters to him are the great lyric
passages of Beck's poem:
Do you really understand
prayer?
The way a nun does .. .
We
learn to do nothing, to exist so
basically that we become al most
plantlike. And instead of that
increasingly desperate hope you
tell
me you awaken with each morn
ing, we
begin to grow little tendrils of
silence. And it's by nurturing
this
silence, by tending it the
way a gardener might delicately
guard
the first thin fingers of an apple
tree that we learn what
it means to pray.
Reverse reincarnation
As the poem indirectly points
out, she is part of Casanova. In

deed all of the characters will
eventually become part of one
another. Not the least fascinating
thing in Enlightenment is Beck's
delightful notion of reincarna
tion which he develops in the
poem.
The superstitious Madame
D'Urfe explains it to Casanova
shortly before their bizarre orgy:
We're
born again in what we
choose to call the past.
Why else do we see only
one direction in time —
Backwards.
At first Casanova thinks that
the lecherous old D'Urfe is in
sane. He encourages her in her
strange ideas and sexual prac
tices (as Beck graphically illus
trates) but only for money. Yet at
the end of his life Casanova
comes to the same conclusion as
he finishes his memoirs:
And so we come
together, the disrupted particles
of the human race, more of us
joining forces each generation
until
there are finally only live and
Adam, and finally, so close to
completion that instead of death
there is only a sleep this time. An
afternoon nap and the process
is finished. We'll awaken to
gether
and stretch. There'll only
be Adam and God.
Has there ever been a more
beautiful theory of death, love,
and reincarnation? We will be
part of those we love, not just
metaphorically, but in the flesh.
The longer poem
No poet writing in English
since Tennyson has been sure
how to write a long poem. The
concentration, intensity, and
subjectivity characteristic of
modern poetry seem almost im
possible to extend over a great
length. Yet modern readers feel
instinctively that any slackness
in a poem makes it unpoetic.
There is no easy way to resolve
this paradox.
Somewhat like Auden in For
the* Time Being, Beck casts his
poem in a loosely dramatic form.
The story progresses in a series
of 16 letters and monologues by
the principle characters. They
tell the story, usually indirectly.
There is no single narrator to
dominate the action.
In finding a successful form

for a longer poem, Heck has suc
ceeded as well as any contem
porary author. Enlightenment
works beautifully as a unified
poem sustaining itself over
nearly 50 pages.
Yet Beck's extraordinary suc
cess seems almost casual. Unlike
Stevens or Found, he exhibits no
Promethean struggle towards
achieving a form. He seems like
an artist of Casanova's own cen
tury, working un
selfconsciously in a form he
never questions. His very confi
dence is decisive. The form of
Enlightenment succeeds be
cause Beck never doubts that it
will.
Beck's poem tells such an
amazing story in such an in
teresting way that the reader is
too fascinated to stop and
criticize it at any point. The
verse is often flat and in many
instances quite bad, but the story
and characterizations are so fine
that such objections are minor.
For a contemporary reader most
50-page poems are difficult to
finish. The story of Beck's
Casanova is hard to put down. 111
fact upon finishing it, there is a
strong temptation to read it
again.
How fitting too that Art Beck is
merely the pseudonym of a San
Francisco businessman who pre
fers to remain unknown. Some
people have suggested that the
several pornographic episodes
in Enlightenment have led him
to this subterfuge. He wants,
they claim, to keep his name
clean. This explanation seems
superficial, however. Does not
the very form of Enlightenment
suggest an author fond of mys
tery and impersonation?
Casanova loved disguises and
pseudonyms. Is it surprising that
an admirer of his would share
this passion?
Enlightenment is not only an
important book for the small
presses on the West Coast. It will
certainly prove to be one of the
most interesting books of
American verse in 1977.
Moreover it should appeal to a
much broader audience than
most contemporary poetry does.
When such a remarkably origi
nal book appears, one can only
hope that its audience will find
it.
