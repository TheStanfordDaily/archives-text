The camera freezes on a knight
lying wounded in a dark, haunt
ing forest. Blood flows in
rivulets through chinks in his
armor. Thus begins Robert Bres
son's latest film, Cannes
prizewinner, Lancelot au Lac. Is
it a drama, or a farce? Who
knows?
The set, dialogue and story are
all realistic. The film closely fol
lows the historical legend of
Lancelot, a knight of the Round
Table who falls in love with King
Arthur's queen, Guinevere.
Their love affair leads to a war
between Arthur and Lancelot.
Before resolving that dispute,
another war breaks out between
Arthur and Mordred (a traitor
trying to usurp Arthur's power.)
Bresson's only alteration of the
original legend is that he has
Lancelot join forces with Arthur
against Mordred, whereas in the
traditional tale Arthur and Lan
celot die in battle against each
other.
Exaggerated effects like the
gushing blood and reverberating
clinking of armor which an
nounces the entrance of each
knight suggest Bresson is aiming
for something quite different
than a 'slice of life' reality. I
sense he is trying hard to make
some statement; unfortunately,
the statement never comes ac
ross.
Despite my puzzlement over
Bresson's message, however, 1
can easily see why he is reputed
as a master of French cinema. He
uses fascinating innovative
techni(}Ues in Lancelot that are
definitely worth seeing.
The photography and sound
are superb. The brilliant colors
and dramatic use of unusual
close-ups create an incredible
sensory experience. Much like
Kubrick's Harry Lyndon, the
visual excellence makes up for a
lot of what is missing.

Bresson has masterfully cap
tured mood and emotion solely
through the use of images. One
close-up, a screen-sized eye of a
frightened horse, creates the an
xiety and fear which precedes a
battle better than thousands of
charging warriors waving
swords ever could.
Bresson is seen at his best dur
ing the jousting tournament.
Lancelot unexpectedly enters
the contest and defeats every
contestant. In Bresson's unusual
style, he creates the intensity
and heat of the contest without
once showing the knights actu
ally duel. Instead, Bresson illus
trates the duels by showing a
series of quick shots: first, he
shows galloping of horses'
hooves, then a knight who tails,
Lancelot receiving a new lance,
then the crowd's reaction, and
finally, the raising of the new

opponent's flag. The editing
quickens as Lancelot conquers a
long line of opponents. Knights
in many colors fall totheground,
one after another.
This technique, the dramatic
intercutting of images creating
the sensation of an event without
ever filming the event, is com
mon in Bresson's films.
Unlike most directors who
rely on characterizations and
dialogue to create mood. Bres
son ignores these areas in film,
preferring instead to use images
and sounds. "In the cinema,"
explains Brftsson, "it must bethe
camera which reveals personal
ity."
Images are so important that
Bresson instructs his actors
(usually non-professionals) to
"just speak the words automati
cally" without thinking about
the meaning, feeling that

dialogue should not detract
from the visual images.
While some critiques applaud
the Bressonian innovation of ex
pressionless acting, claiming it
is "more convincing than the
expression produced by
naturalistic acting." the dead
pan, sotto voce speeches do little
for me. The actors' complete lack
of expression is so peculiar that
it makes the dialogue more
noticeable than the "natural"
acting. It causes confusion and
seriously detracts from the vis
ual splendor of the film.
1 was never sure whether the
lines were supposed to be seri
ous or farcial and consequently,
was unable to get involved in the
story. Instead I could only sit
back, distanced from the film,
wondering whether to laugh or
cry, and not understanding
enough to do either.
