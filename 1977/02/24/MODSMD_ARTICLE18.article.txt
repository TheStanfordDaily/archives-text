## Trio succeeds, romantically 
### 
A warm, romantic style highlighted the fourth
concert in the FrancescoTrio's "Brahms fr Others"
series Friday night featuring the works of
Stravinsky, Brahms and Schubert.
Trio members Bonnie Hampton, cellist, David
Abel, violinist, and Nathan Schwartz, pianist, are
Stanford artists-in-residence and have just com
pleted a successful East Coast tour.
The Duo Concertont for Violin and Piano (1932)
was composed in the middle of Stravinsky's
"neo-classic" period. Although Stravinsky's
music of this period is often arid and coldly intel
lectual. the I)iio Concertant varies from lush lyri
cism to bleak counterpoint, within the structure of
a live-movement Baroque suite.
Abel and Schwartz emphasized the tepid, emo
tional side of this work through slower tempi,
heavy pedal effects, and a warm vibrato. Only in
the second movement, Kglogue I. did they revert to
a colder, choppy style. Although the final move
ment — an elegiac Difhyrambe — was sensitively
passionate, the rich style was ineffective in the first
movement (the title Cantilene, notwithstanding)
where several key rhythmic figures in the piano
were washed out by excessive pedal effects.
I lampton joined the duet lor the Brahms Trio in
(' Minor, which formed the centerpiece of the
evening. This trio consists of two monumental
outer movements embracing several shorter and
lighter sections. As in most C-minor Brahms (for
example, the First Symphony) it is crucial that the
performers start at maximum energy and im
mediately sweep the audience away.
The Trio succeeded brilliantly, taking the initial
marking, Allegro Fnergico, to heart, and infusing
power and vitality into the first bars. Marred only
by a few intonation problems in the upper register
of the violin, the flow of white-hot virtuosity con
tinued unabated until the shattering conclusion.

The second movement, an exquisitely delicate
Presto NonAssai, was a muted pianissimo contrast
to the initial section. The Trio delivered a perci
pient interpretation, although the piano occas
sionally played two loudly.
After a pensive Andante intermezzo, the Trio
dipped once again into molten C-minor Brahms.
Although playing with flawless technique and
sonorous warmth, there was a slight decrease in
intensity. One doesn't know whether to blame
Brahms or theTrio, but the final movement did not
quite live up to the promise of the first.
Sweeping buck in time over half a century from
Brahms, the Trio came to the brilliant chamber
music of Franz Schubert. His lighthearted and un
assuming B-flat Majoi Trio was the antithesis to
the overt emotionalism of Brahms. The salient
characteristic of this Schubert is a delicate lyri
cism, which must be handled with restraint.
At first it seemed that the Trio did not realize this
essential difference: they barged into the Schubert
with the same Brahmsian license, but Schubert's
music won them over and, by the first movement
recapitulation, the requisite light touch became
evident.
The second movement is woven around oik; of
Schnbert's yearning Andante themes, initially
stated by the solo cello. Hampton interpreted this
section emotionally hut without the tenderness
that one might have preferred.
The true Schubert spirit was evident in the last
two movements — a rolicking Scherzo and a
Hondo finale. Schwartz handled the characteristic
high piano melodies with a sensitive touch while
Abel carried on a delicate musical conversation
with the cello. Despite great 'liberty with the
tempo, the final movement successfully capped
the evening, and audience responded enthusiasti
cally.

lectual. the I)iio Concertant varies from lush lyri
cism to bleak counterpoint, within the structure of
a live-movement Baroque suite.
Abel and Schwartz emphasized the tepid, emo
tional side of this work through slower tempi,
heavy pedal effects, and a warm vibrato. Only in
the second movement, Kglogue I. did they revert to
a colder, choppy style. Although the final move
ment — an elegiac Difhyrambe — was sensitively
passionate, the rich style was ineffective in the first
movement (the title Cantilene, notwithstanding)
where several key rhythmic figures in the piano
were washed out by excessive pedal effects.
I lampton joined the duet lor the Brahms Trio in
(' Minor, which formed the centerpiece of the
evening. This trio consists of two monumental
outer movements embracing several shorter and
lighter sections. As in most C-minor Brahms (for
example, the First Symphony) it is crucial that the
performers start at maximum energy and im
mediately sweep the audience away.
The Trio succeeded brilliantly, taking the initial
marking, Allegro Fnergico, to heart, and infusing
power and vitality into the first bars. Marred only
by a few intonation problems in the upper register
of the violin, the flow of white-hot virtuosity con
tinued unabated until the shattering conclusion.

The second movement, an exquisitely delicate
Presto NonAssai, was a muted pianissimo contrast
to the initial section. The Trio delivered a perci
pient interpretation, although the piano occas
sionally played two loudly.
After a pensive Andante intermezzo, the Trio
dipped once again into molten C-minor Brahms.
Although playing with flawless technique and
sonorous warmth, there was a slight decrease in
intensity. One doesn't know whether to blame
Brahms or theTrio, but the final movement did not
quite live up to the promise of the first.
Sweeping buck in time over half a century from
Brahms, the Trio came to the brilliant chamber
music of Franz Schubert. His lighthearted and un
assuming B-flat Majoi Trio was the antithesis to
the overt emotionalism of Brahms. The salient
characteristic of this Schubert is a delicate lyri
cism, which must be handled with restraint.
At first it seemed that the Trio did not realize this
essential difference: they barged into the Schubert
with the same Brahmsian license, but Schubert's
music won them over and, by the first movement
recapitulation, the requisite light touch became
evident.
The second movement is woven around oik; of
Schnbert's yearning Andante themes, initially
stated by the solo cello. Hampton interpreted this
section emotionally hut without the tenderness
that one might have preferred.
The true Schubert spirit was evident in the last
two movements — a rolicking Scherzo and a
Hondo finale. Schwartz handled the characteristic
high piano melodies with a sensitive touch while
Abel carried on a delicate musical conversation
with the cello. Despite great 'liberty with the
tempo, the final movement successfully capped
the evening, and audience responded enthusiasti
cally.
A warm, romantic style highlighted the fourth
concert in the FrancescoTrio's "Brahms fr Others"
series Friday night featuring the works of
Stravinsky, Brahms and Schubert.
Trio members Bonnie Hampton, cellist, David
Abel, violinist, and Nathan Schwartz, pianist, are
Stanford artists-in-residence and have just com
pleted a successful East Coast tour.
The Duo Concertont for Violin and Piano (1932)
was composed in the middle of Stravinsky's
