## Rollins' latest maintains trend 
### 
Sonny Rollins' reputation still
rests on his recording of more
than a decade ago — but that
reputation is enough to establish
him in many minds as the
greatest living tenor
saxophonist. The unmistakable

thick, soulful tone that made
Rollins famous hasn't faded a bit
over 20 years,'but the interest of
his musical settings has sagged
considerably. This new release
doesn't change any trends.
At his best Rollins can work
independently of musical fash
ions, and is capable of redeem
ing mediocre material with his
witty, solos. Hut even the most
idosyncratic player can be
helped by the talents of his col
laborators. Rollins has been
without such help for many
years, and it's beginning to
show.
This album's supporting cast
could have been lifted from a
dozen other records. Patrice
Rushen, the young pianist,
guitarist Lee Ritenour and bas
sist Alex Blake are capable back
up players, but they tend to dis
tract from Rollins instead of
complementing him. Billy

Cobham, who can he a fascinat
ing original drummer, here dis
plays his annoying habit of play
ing as if it doesn't matter what
any of the other musicians are
doing. And behind everyone
there is a horn section — mixed
so softly that it seems the pro
ducers had second thoughts
about including it at all.
There is one sparkling com
position — Rollins' "Island
Lady" — to go with the other six
pieces in various jazz-rockish
styles that do little justice to Rol
lins' genius. Everything is
worthy of a capable tenor
saxophonist of the Grover
Washington or Joe Henderson
type — but Rollins and the re-,
cord label ought to know that he
belongs not with them but with
the best jazz musicians of the
postwar years. This album won't
convince many people who
don't already know that.
