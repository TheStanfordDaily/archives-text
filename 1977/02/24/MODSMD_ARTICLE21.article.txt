## 'Cabaret' shines 
### 
"What good is sitting alone in
your room?
Come hear the music play!
Life is a cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret!"
Okay, so finals are less than
three weeks away and you ha
ven't even opened your human
sex book yet. But before you get
out your earplugs and start
haunting Meyer, take an evening
off and visit ToyonaroundH p.m.
Thursday through Saturday.
For a couple of hours you can
"leave your troubles outside," as
Emcee says, and abandon your
self to the sparkle and glitter of
the Kit Kat Club.
The Toyon-ICC production of
Cabaret proves that Toyon de
serves its reputation as one of the
most talented dorms on campus.
Every member of the cast makes
an outstanding effort, and direc
tor Jeff Little can be justly proud
of his ability to put on a show
with as much sparkle and polish
as Sally's green fingernails.
Clark Sterling's performance
as Emcee is truly exceptional.
Master of the obscene leer and
sneaky pinch, his professional
showmanship would have been
commended by Joel Gray him
self. His strutting and cane
twirling is a certain audience
pleaser, and while all his songs
are excellent, "Two Ladies"
with Sheila Sund and Laurie
Haniman is oneof the highlights
of the show.
Simone Cox, as fellow cast
member Rick Everist says,can re
ally belt out a song. Each of her
acts at the Kit Kat Club is the
confident performance of a pro
fessional showgirl.
"Don't Tell Mama," with the
rest of the Kit Kat Girls, is one of
the best, but every song was ad

mirably executed. Her acting
ability is suited to the part of
Sally Bowles, the charming but
synthetic English girl, though
she would have been more be
lievable if she had a British ac
cent.
All the singers deserve praise.
John Greeno's beautiful voice
brings alive the part of Sally's
lover Cliff Bradshaw. Special
compliments also to Laurie
Daily, the German prostitute
with a large family of "cousins"
in the navy.
Her poignant performance of
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me" is
probably the most stirring scene
in the play. Kick Everist and
Andrea Stang are also touching
as the bumbling fruit-stand
keeper and the spinster landlady
who are prevented from marry
ing because he is a Jew.
The Kit Kat Girls, directed by
Denise Gallardo, are undoub
tedly the highlight of the pro
duction. Their dancing is exe
cuted with a brazen skill worthy
of the excellent choreography,
and it is they who provide the
sparkle which lifts the play from
good to superlative.
Don't expect the play to be just
like the movie. It is very similar
in some ways — several of the
songs are familiar, and the chil
ling theme of the Nazi's rise to
power is the same.
Sally and Cliff's relationship
is about the same as Sally and
Brien's — although it is she who
invites herself to live in his room
— but their story doesn't domi
nate the play to the same extent
that it does the movie.
Jeff Little, who directed
Cabaret, thinks the theme is
more effectively presented in the
play because "you don't get in
volved in a lot of subplots."
"But 1 think the play addresses
the problems of the Jews more
seriously. It goes beyond that,
too, and offers a slice of life in
pre-war Berlin," Little said.
