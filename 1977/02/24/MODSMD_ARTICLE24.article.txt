## Chappie 'Comics' 
### 
The Stanford Chaparral, oft
criticized as an elitist, albeit
hilarious, display of inside
humor and sexist dementia, has
come through with the finest
collection of humor and satire
since the early days of the Na
tional Lampoon. Entitled Crash
Comics, the latest issue contains
an amazing amount of original
humor and deadly parodies.
Responding to the cries of "in
side humor" which are always
ignorantly uttered at the publi
cation of their infamous "Reg
Packs", the Chappies have
broadened their illuminating
perceptions to include self
improvement messiahs, Social
Darwinists, people who think
that they're funny, underground
comics, dead young television
stars, unsuccessful theme
houses that refuse to fold, and of
course, nerds.
The Chaparral has never been
subtle in it's attacks on the last

group, but this time they have
gone too far. The magazine in
cludes a full color pull-out
poster of the Old Boy, the Chap
pie mascot, bludgeoning a nerd
with the famed "hammer." One
would think that, surely, the
Chaparral is not advocating the
wholesale murder of these un
fortunate creatures, but- editor
Jon Barth tells me, "We sure as
hell are."
Barth explained the success of
the issue. "We've discovered
new talent in students who were
previously afraid to step forth.
And, of course, a good deal of
the issue was written by women,
which gives equal time for the
little ladies to express their futile
viewpoints. And that autog
raphed pic of Farrah Fawcett on
page 1 won't hurt our sales any,
heh, heh."
Others feel that the success ot
the issue is dependant upon it's
commitment to universal

humor. The inside, or "Stan
ford" humor is confined to the
small, subtle stuff, while the
bigger stuff speaks of more cos
mic bufferings of the human
condition.
The Chaparral, Barth exp
lains, is the number one purpose
of the Hammer and Coffin Soci
ety. "This ASSU shit is good for
publicizing our issues, but is to
tally meaningless by itself. The
message is that students should
stop thinking they're so impor
tant; they might do something of
value to humanity in the future,
but as of now, they're infinitesi
mal pieces of scum inCod's fecal
colon. People in the ASSU think
they're politicians and student
leaders, but what they really are
is a mass of future law stu
dents ..." he was misquoted as
saying.
(The ChaporruJ is so funny only
its editor would review it.)

collection of humor and satire
since the early days of the Na
tional Lampoon. Entitled Crash
Comics, the latest issue contains
an amazing amount of original
humor and deadly parodies.
Responding to the cries of "in
side humor" which are always
ignorantly uttered at the publi
cation of their infamous "Reg
Packs", the Chappies have
broadened their illuminating
perceptions to include self
improvement messiahs, Social
Darwinists, people who think
that they're funny, underground
comics, dead young television
stars, unsuccessful theme
houses that refuse to fold, and of
course, nerds.
The Chaparral has never been
subtle in it's attacks on the last

group, but this time they have
gone too far. The magazine in
cludes a full color pull-out
poster of the Old Boy, the Chap
pie mascot, bludgeoning a nerd
with the famed "hammer." One
would think that, surely, the
Chaparral is not advocating the
wholesale murder of these un
fortunate creatures, but- editor
Jon Barth tells me, "We sure as
hell are."
Barth explained the success of
the issue. "We've discovered
new talent in students who were
previously afraid to step forth.
And, of course, a good deal of
the issue was written by women,
which gives equal time for the
little ladies to express their futile
viewpoints. And that autog
raphed pic of Farrah Fawcett on
page 1 won't hurt our sales any,
heh, heh."
Others feel that the success ot
the issue is dependant upon it's
commitment to universal

humor. The inside, or "Stan
ford" humor is confined to the
small, subtle stuff, while the
bigger stuff speaks of more cos
mic bufferings of the human
condition.
The Chaparral, Barth exp
lains, is the number one purpose
of the Hammer and Coffin Soci
ety. "This ASSU shit is good for
publicizing our issues, but is to
tally meaningless by itself. The
message is that students should
stop thinking they're so impor
tant; they might do something of
value to humanity in the future,
but as of now, they're infinitesi
mal pieces of scum inCod's fecal
colon. People in the ASSU think
they're politicians and student
leaders, but what they really are
is a mass of future law stu
dents ..." he was misquoted as
saying.
(The ChaporruJ is so funny only
its editor would review it.)
The Stanford Chaparral, oft
criticized as an elitist, albeit
hilarious, display of inside
humor and sexist dementia, has
come through with the finest
