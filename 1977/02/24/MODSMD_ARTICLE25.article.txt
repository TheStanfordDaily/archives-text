### 
Kamouraska. Canada 1973.
Directed by Claude Jutra.
A sweeping romantic film, set
in 19th century Quebec and
great north of Canada, about a
passionate woman who tries to
escape from the prison of Victo
rian morality and a loveless mar
riage.*
Nel Nome del Padre (In the
Name of Father.) Italy, 1971.
Directed by Marco Bellocchio.
An angry film describing the
life in a boys' school where edu
cation is conceived as a process
of enslavement and corruption.*
Lovejoy's Nuclear War. (Against
"the Grain)
A cross section of the many
and varied points of view about
nuclear power, civil dis
obediance, and the politics of
ehergy that were drawn together
ap of sabotage against a
<v, 500-fobt steel utility tower in
Massachusetts.*
The Golem. Germany, 1920.
(Sponsored by the United Jewish
Appeal.)
. by Paul Wegener,
'fcijsed on the Jewish legend,
this early, silent classic is about
Rabbi Loew, who, in Medieval
times, creates from clay a giant
human figure and brings him to
life to protect the local Jews
against a program. This film was
apparently very influential in
the creation of James Whale's
Frankenstein, a decade later.*
Hand Tinting. (Women's Film
Series.)
Directed by Joyce Wieland.
An avant-garde film in which
director Wieland plays with var
ious colors and tints, as she cap
tures the recreational activities
of a young woman in a education

center. (Showing on a triple bill
with Water Sark and Film About
A Woman Who.)*
The Missouri Breaks. USA,
1976. (Chaparral Film Series.)
Directed by Arthur Penn, with
Jack Nicholson and Marlon
Brando.
Set in the Old West, this is an
interesting, but perhaps publicly
misunderstood film. There is not
much social statement or poetic
comment involved. Rather, the
film is an exploration of a very
distinct, ambivalent mood.
Rashomon. Japan, 1951. (Stan
ford Film Society.)
Directed by Akira Kurosawa.
A double crime of rape and
murder, to which there are four
witnesses, occurs in an isolated
wood. The film recreates each
account given by the four, reve
aling the influences of personal
perspective and the subsequent
distortions on the unknown, ul
timate truth. Rashomon is cre
dited with having opened the
eyes of the West to the vast artis
tic wealth in Japanese cinema.
(Showing on a double-bill with
She Wore A Yellow Ribbon.)
She Wore A Yellow Ribbon.
USA. 1949. (Stanford Film Soci
ety.)
Directed by John Ford.
John Wayne plays a macho
calvary commander who cannot
resist one more battle with the
Indians before he retires in this
tightly-directed film. (Showing
on a double-bill with Rasho
man.)*
The Sunshine Boys. USA, 1975.
(ASSU Sunday Flicks.)
A pure and simple Neil Simon
comedy, concerning the reunion

of a stand-up comedy team of
two men who have not spoken to
each other for twenty years. One
of the most hilarious films of the
last decade, with stupendous
performances from both Walter
Matthau and George Burns.
Water Sark. (Women's Film
Series.)
Directed by Joyce Wieland.
Filmed at her own kitchen ta
ble, Wieland calls her film "the
high art of a housewife ... a film
sculpture, drawing being made
while you wait." (Showing on a
triple bill with Water Sark and
Film About A Woman Who)
An Evening Of Shorts. (Law
School Film Society.)
With such delights as "What Is
Communism," Tricky's "Old
Glory" speech, an Edsel com
mercial, and the perennial clas
sic "Bambi Meets Godzilla." and
many more . ..
People Of The Wind: The
Chronicle Of A Nomadic Chief.
(Off-campus.)
A magnificently photo
graphed documentary which
follows the Babadi tribe of the
Bakhtiari people of Southern
Iran on their annual migration to
the summer pastures. Once an
infamous, warring tribe, the
Babadi have turned to a nomadic
life of sheep herding. The film is
less an anthropolotical study of
their customs or beliefs than a
peek at their means of liveli
hood. Filmed on the Zagros
mountains near thePersian Gull,
this is one of the most visually
rewarding films ever made.

People Of The Wind: The
Chronicle Of A Nomadic Chief.
(Off-campus.)
A magnificently photo
graphed documentary which
follows the Babadi tribe of the
Bakhtiari people of Southern
Iran on their annual migration to
the summer pastures. Once an
infamous, warring tribe, the
Babadi have turned to a nomadic
life of sheep herding. The film is
less an anthropolotical study of
their customs or beliefs than a
peek at their means of liveli
hood. Filmed on the Zagros
mountains near thePersian Gull,
this is one of the most visually
rewarding films ever made.

Kamouraska. Canada 1973.
Directed by Claude Jutra.
A sweeping romantic film, set
in 19th century Quebec and
great north of Canada, about a
passionate woman who tries to
escape from the prison of Victo
rian morality and a loveless mar
riage.*
Nel Nome del Padre (In the
Name of Father.) Italy, 1971.
Directed by Marco Bellocchio.
An angry film describing the
life in a boys' school where edu
cation is conceived as a process
of enslavement and corruption.*
Lovejoy's Nuclear War. (Against
"the Grain)
A cross section of the many
and varied points of view about
nuclear power, civil dis
obediance, and the politics of
ehergy that were drawn together

<v, 500-fobt steel utility tower in

The Golem. Germany, 1920.
(Sponsored by the United Jewish

. by Paul Wegener,
'fcijsed on the Jewish legend,
this early, silent classic is about
Rabbi Loew, who, in Medieval
times, creates from clay a giant
human figure and brings him to
life to protect the local Jews
against a program. This film was
apparently very influential in
the creation of James Whale's
Frankenstein, a decade later.*
Hand Tinting. (Women's Film
Series.)
Directed by Joyce Wieland.
An avant-garde film in which
director Wieland plays with var
ious colors and tints, as she cap
tures the recreational activities
of a young woman in a education

center. (Showing on a triple bill
with Water Sark and Film About
A Woman Who.)*
The Missouri Breaks. USA,
1976. (Chaparral Film Series.)
Directed by Arthur Penn, with
Jack Nicholson and Marlon
Brando.
Set in the Old West, this is an
interesting, but perhaps publicly
misunderstood film. There is not
much social statement or poetic
comment involved. Rather, the
film is an exploration of a very
distinct, ambivalent mood.
Rashomon. Japan, 1951. (Stan
ford Film Society.)
Directed by Akira Kurosawa.
A double crime of rape and
murder, to which there are four
witnesses, occurs in an isolated
wood. The film recreates each
account given by the four, reve
aling the influences of personal
perspective and the subsequent
distortions on the unknown, ul
timate truth. Rashomon is cre
dited with having opened the
eyes of the West to the vast artis
tic wealth in Japanese cinema.

tightly-directed film. (Showing

The Sunshine Boys. USA, 1975.
(ASSU Sunday Flicks.)
A pure and simple Neil Simon
comedy, concerning the reunion

of a stand-up comedy team of
two men who have not spoken to

of the most hilarious films of the
last decade, with stupendous
performances from both Walter
Matthau and George Burns.
Water Sark. (Women's Film

tightly-directed film. (Showing

The Sunshine Boys. USA, 1975.
(ASSU Sunday Flicks.)
A pure and simple Neil Simon
comedy, concerning the reunion

of a stand-up comedy team of
two men who have not spoken to
each other for twenty years. One
of the most hilarious films of the
last decade, with stupendous
performances from both Walter
Matthau and George Burns.
Water Sark. (Women's Film
Series.)
Directed by Joyce Wieland.
Filmed at her own kitchen ta
ble, Wieland calls her film "the
high art of a housewife ... a film
sculpture, drawing being made
while you wait." (Showing on a
triple bill with Water Sark and
Film About A Woman Who)
An Evening Of Shorts. (Law
School Film Society.)
With such delights as "What Is
Communism," Tricky's "Old
Glory" speech, an Edsel com
mercial, and the perennial clas
sic "Bambi Meets Godzilla." and
many more . ..
People Of The Wind: The
Chronicle Of A Nomadic Chief.
(Off-campus.)
A magnificently photo
graphed documentary which
follows the Babadi tribe of the
Bakhtiari people of Southern
Iran on their annual migration to
the summer pastures. Once an
infamous, warring tribe, the
Babadi have turned to a nomadic
life of sheep herding. The film is
less an anthropolotical study of
their customs or beliefs than a
peek at their means of liveli
hood. Filmed on the Zagros
mountains near thePersian Gull,
this is one of the most visually
rewarding films ever made.
