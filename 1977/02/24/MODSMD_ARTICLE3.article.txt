# Bill could boost fundraising costs here

The University could face higher
fundraising costs if Congress approves
a bill requiring charitable organiza
tions to report the percentage of con
tributions used for fundraising ac
tivities.
More man-hours, more forms to file
and possibly new accounting proce
dures would result in higher costs, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig. vice
president for public affairs.
Administrators said they could not
even estimate the additional cost be
cause the bill does not specify actual
rules and regulations.
The bill. H.R. 41, was introduced the
first day of the new Congress by Rep.
Charles Wilson (D-Ha'wthorne).
It is designed to inform prospective
donors of how their money is being
spent. The proposal responds to a
number of questionable uses of funds
received by charities, according to
Robert Preelen, director of goyernment
relations here.
Missionary group
Freelen cited the example of the Pal
lottine Fathers, a missionary group
from Baltimore, which apparently
used less than five per certt of over $20
million of donations for the stated
charitable purpose.
Other examples of misuse exist,
Freelen said. Rosenzweig agreed, but
said "there are lots of abuses in the
world which can't be solved or
shouldn't be solved by legislation."
Rosenzweig said criminals are not
asked to report their activities. Rather,
the proper officials formulate a case
against the individual and prosecute
them. A similar policing method
should be used with unethical fun
draising outfits, he said.
Wilson, on theother hand, called the

proposal "among the most important
pieces of consumer legislation to be
considered by the 95th Congress," in
an "extension of remarks" in Congres
sional Record Jan. 4.
'Our spirit'
Wilson said he felt "strong volun
tary support for philanthropic enter
prises is one of the best indications of
our spirit as a nation." He said, though,
that since $29 billion was given to
charities last year, safeguarding regu
lations are needed.
Under the bill, charities would have

to include in its mail solicitations:
—the percentage of all contributions
which remained for direct application
to the charitable purpose after deduct
ing fundraising and management and
general costs:
—the purpose of the solicitation and
the intended use of tlie contribution;
and
—the right of the contributor to re
quest a complete financial report
which the organization would be re
quired to forward.
The bill would place compliance

under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Postal Service, and the Post Office
would have the power to establish ac
counting methods to be used to assure
compliance.
The bill would not apply to mem
bers of the organization in question.
Alumni, students, faculty, members of
governing boards and appointed
committees of a college or university
and members of their families are con
sidered members of the University.
