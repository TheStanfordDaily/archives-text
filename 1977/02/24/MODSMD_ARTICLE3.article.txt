# Bill could boost fundraising costs here
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The University could face higher
fundraising costs if Congress approves
a bill requiring charitable organiza
tions to report the percentage of con
tributions used for fundraising ac
tivities.
More man-hours, more forms to file
and possibly new accounting proce
dures would result in higher costs, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig. vice
president for public affairs.
Administrators said they could not
even estimate the additional cost be
cause the bill does not specify actual
rules and regulations.
The bill. H.R. 41, was introduced the
first day of the new Congress by Rep.
Charles Wilson (D-Ha'wthorne).
It is designed to inform prospective
donors of how their money is being
spent. The proposal responds to a
number of questionable uses of funds
received by charities, according to
Robert Preelen, director of goyernment
relations here.
Missionary group
Freelen cited the example of the Pal
lottine Fathers, a missionary group
from Baltimore, which apparently
used less than five per certt of over $20
million of donations for the stated
charitable purpose.
Other examples of misuse exist,
Freelen said. Rosenzweig agreed, but
said "there are lots of abuses in the
world which can't be solved or
shouldn't be solved by legislation."
Rosenzweig said criminals are not
asked to report their activities. Rather,
the proper officials formulate a case
against the individual and prosecute
them. A similar policing method
should be used with unethical fun
draising outfits, he said.
Wilson, on theother hand, called the

proposal "among the most important
pieces of consumer legislation to be
considered by the 95th Congress," in
an "extension of remarks" in Congres
sional Record Jan. 4.
'Our spirit'
Wilson said he felt "strong volun
tary support for philanthropic enter
prises is one of the best indications of
our spirit as a nation." He said, though,
that since $29 billion was given to
charities last year, safeguarding regu
lations are needed.
Under the bill, charities would have

to include in its mail solicitations:
—the percentage of all contributions
which remained for direct application
to the charitable purpose after deduct
ing fundraising and management and
general costs:
—the purpose of the solicitation and
the intended use of tlie contribution;
and
—the right of the contributor to re
quest a complete financial report
which the organization would be re
quired to forward.
The bill would place compliance

under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Postal Service, and the Post Office
would have the power to establish ac
counting methods to be used to assure
compliance.
The bill would not apply to mem
bers of the organization in question.
Alumni, students, faculty, members of
governing boards and appointed
committees of a college or university
and members of their families are con
sidered members of the University.
Some administrators say they feel
the bill would require drastic changes
in the University's accounting
methods. According to George Greg
ory, associate staff counsel, the Uni
versity employs the audit guides of the
American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) in its account
ing. Four such guides exist, one de
signed specifically for educational in
stitutions.
Hospitals, voluntary health and wel
fare organizations and state and local
governments employ the other three
audit guides, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
Gregory said the beauty of the
guides is that they acknowledge dif
ferences in organizations. He said he
fears the new rules might ignore these
inherent differences.
"It might take several years to de
velop an accounting method which
would satisfy everyone," Gregory said.
Moreover, he said it would be "very
expensive."
Other objections were raised by the
Council for Advancement and Support
of Education (CASE). The group,
which lobbies for almost every four
year college or university in the coun
try, is "very concerned about the bill,"
according to Vice President Kerry
McClanahan.
McClanahan said the bill has three
major problem areas. First, jurisdic
tion should be in the hands of the
Treasury Department, according to
McClanahan, because it is experienced
with the problems of charitable or
ganizations. The Post Office is not, he
said.
Second, the bill would not preempt
any of the 32 different state laws which
presently restrict fundraising ac
tivities in some way. If jurisdiction

stays with the Post Office, McClana
han said, no preemption would be al
lowed. Regulations added to Treasury
Department tax laws could preempt
state laws, though.
Finally, the bill, according to
McClanahan, is aimed at organizations
such as the United Way which collect
money and then distribute it in grant
form. He said it was not desigtied to
cover a university which uses col
lected funds internally.
He said CASE objected to "simplis
tic, single-number evaluation of the
fundraising costs outside the arena of
an annual report." He said a percen
tage figure alone reveals little about
the efficiency of the organization.
An annual report available on re
quest is the type of disclosure
McClanahan said CASE will lobby for.
McClanahan said nearly every
member of his group already publishes
annual reports which include fun
draising cost information.
The University publishes such a re
port.
The bill is a "refined version" of
H.R. 10922 introduced in the 94th
Congress. "The concept of the bill is
basically unchanged," according to
Mike Cavanagh, staff assistant to the
Subcommittee on Postal Personnel
and Modernization of the House Post
Office and Civil Service Committee.
Last year the bill cleared the com
mittee with a favorable vote, but never
reached the House floor. Cavanagh
said hearings on the proposal will
begin next month.
Presently, 31.5 percent of all operat
ing funds here come either from gifts
or income from prior gifts. Each year,
the University solicits some 111,000
prospective donors with a staff of 3600
volunteers across the country, accord
ing to General Secretary's Office fi
gures.

draising outfits, he said.
Wilson, on theother hand, called the

proposal "among the most important
pieces of consumer legislation to be
considered by the 95th Congress," in
an "extension of remarks" in Congres
sional Record Jan. 4.
'Our spirit'
Wilson said he felt "strong volun
tary support for philanthropic enter
prises is one of the best indications of
our spirit as a nation." He said, though,
that since $29 billion was given to
charities last year, safeguarding regu
lations are needed.
Under the bill, charities would have

to include in its mail solicitations:
—the percentage of all contributions
which remained for direct application
to the charitable purpose after deduct
ing fundraising and management and
general costs:
—the purpose of the solicitation and
the intended use of tlie contribution;
and
—the right of the contributor to re
quest a complete financial report
which the organization would be re
quired to forward.
The bill would place compliance

under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Postal Service, and the Post Office
would have the power to establish ac
counting methods to be used to assure
compliance.
The bill would not apply to mem
bers of the organization in question.
Alumni, students, faculty, members of
governing boards and appointed
committees of a college or university
and members of their families are con
sidered members of the University.
Some administrators say they feel
the bill would require drastic changes
in the University's accounting
methods. According to George Greg
ory, associate staff counsel, the Uni
versity employs the audit guides of the
American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) in its account
ing. Four such guides exist, one de
signed specifically for educational in
stitutions.
Hospitals, voluntary health and wel
fare organizations and state and local
governments employ the other three
audit guides, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
Gregory said the beauty of the
guides is that they acknowledge dif
ferences in organizations. He said he
fears the new rules might ignore these
inherent differences.
"It might take several years to de
velop an accounting method which
would satisfy everyone," Gregory said.
Moreover, he said it would be "very
expensive."
Other objections were raised by the
Council for Advancement and Support
of Education (CASE). The group,
which lobbies for almost every four
year college or university in the coun
try, is "very concerned about the bill,"
according to Vice President Kerry
McClanahan.
McClanahan said the bill has three
major problem areas. First, jurisdic
tion should be in the hands of the
Treasury Department, according to
McClanahan, because it is experienced
with the problems of charitable or
ganizations. The Post Office is not, he
said.
Second, the bill would not preempt
any of the 32 different state laws which
presently restrict fundraising ac
tivities in some way. If jurisdiction

stays with the Post Office, McClana
han said, no preemption would be al
lowed. Regulations added to Treasury
Department tax laws could preempt
state laws, though.
Finally, the bill, according to
McClanahan, is aimed at organizations
such as the United Way which collect
money and then distribute it in grant
form. He said it was not desigtied to
cover a university which uses col
lected funds internally.
He said CASE objected to "simplis
tic, single-number evaluation of the
fundraising costs outside the arena of
an annual report." He said a percen
tage figure alone reveals little about
the efficiency of the organization.
An annual report available on re
quest is the type of disclosure
McClanahan said CASE will lobby for.
McClanahan said nearly every
member of his group already publishes
annual reports which include fun
draising cost information.
The University publishes such a re
port.
The bill is a "refined version" of
H.R. 10922 introduced in the 94th
Congress. "The concept of the bill is
basically unchanged," according to
Mike Cavanagh, staff assistant to the
Subcommittee on Postal Personnel
and Modernization of the House Post
Office and Civil Service Committee.
Last year the bill cleared the com
mittee with a favorable vote, but never
reached the House floor. Cavanagh
said hearings on the proposal will
begin next month.
Presently, 31.5 percent of all operat
ing funds here come either from gifts
or income from prior gifts. Each year,
the University solicits some 111,000
prospective donors with a staff of 3600
volunteers across the country, accord
ing to General Secretary's Office fi
gures.
The University could face higher
fundraising costs if Congress approves
a bill requiring charitable organiza
tions to report the percentage of con
tributions used for fundraising ac
tivities.
More man-hours, more forms to file
and possibly new accounting proce
dures would result in higher costs, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig. vice
president for public affairs.
Administrators said they could not
even estimate the additional cost be
cause the bill does not specify actual
rules and regulations.
The bill. H.R. 41, was introduced the
first day of the new Congress by Rep.
Charles Wilson (D-Ha'wthorne).
It is designed to inform prospective
donors of how their money is being
spent. The proposal responds to a
number of questionable uses of funds
received by charities, according to
Robert Preelen, director of goyernment
relations here.
Missionary group
Freelen cited the example of the Pal
lottine Fathers, a missionary group
from Baltimore, which apparently
used less than five per certt of over $20
million of donations for the stated
charitable purpose.
Other examples of misuse exist,
Freelen said. Rosenzweig agreed, but
said "there are lots of abuses in the
world which can't be solved or
shouldn't be solved by legislation."
Rosenzweig said criminals are not
asked to report their activities. Rather,
the proper officials formulate a case
against the individual and prosecute
them. A similar policing method
should be used with unethical fun
draising outfits, he said.

methods. According to George Greg
ory, associate staff counsel, the Uni
versity employs the audit guides of the
American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) in its account
ing. Four such guides exist, one de
signed specifically for educational in
stitutions.
Hospitals, voluntary health and wel
fare organizations and state and local
governments employ the other three
audit guides, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
Gregory said the beauty of the
guides is that they acknowledge dif
ferences in organizations. He said he
fears the new rules might ignore these
inherent differences.
"It might take several years to de
velop an accounting method which
would satisfy everyone," Gregory said.
Moreover, he said it would be "very
expensive."
Other objections were raised by the
Council for Advancement and Support
of Education (CASE). The group,
which lobbies for almost every four
year college or university in the coun
try, is "very concerned about the bill,"
according to Vice President Kerry
McClanahan.
McClanahan said the bill has three
major problem areas. First, jurisdic
tion should be in the hands of the
Treasury Department, according to
McClanahan, because it is experienced
with the problems of charitable or
ganizations. The Post Office is not, he
said.
Second, the bill would not preempt
any of the 32 different state laws which
presently restrict fundraising ac
tivities in some way. If jurisdiction

stays with the Post Office, McClana
han said, no preemption would be al
lowed. Regulations added to Treasury
Department tax laws could preempt
state laws, though.
Finally, the bill, according to
McClanahan, is aimed at organizations
such as the United Way which collect
money and then distribute it in grant
form. He said it was not desigtied to
cover a university which uses col
lected funds internally.
He said CASE objected to "simplis
tic, single-number evaluation of the
fundraising costs outside the arena of
an annual report." He said a percen
tage figure alone reveals little about
the efficiency of the organization.
An annual report available on re
quest is the type of disclosure
McClanahan said CASE will lobby for.
McClanahan said nearly every
member of his group already publishes
annual reports which include fun
draising cost information.
The University publishes such a re
port.
The bill is a "refined version" of
H.R. 10922 introduced in the 94th
Congress. "The concept of the bill is
basically unchanged," according to
Mike Cavanagh, staff assistant to the
Subcommittee on Postal Personnel
and Modernization of the House Post
Office and Civil Service Committee.
Last year the bill cleared the com
mittee with a favorable vote, but never
reached the House floor. Cavanagh
said hearings on the proposal will
begin next month.
Presently, 31.5 percent of all operat
ing funds here come either from gifts
or income from prior gifts. Each year,
the University solicits some 111,000
prospective donors with a staff of 3600
volunteers across the country, accord
ing to General Secretary's Office fi
gures.
The University could face higher
fundraising costs if Congress approves
a bill requiring charitable organiza
tions to report the percentage of con
tributions used for fundraising ac
tivities.
More man-hours, more forms to file
and possibly new accounting proce
dures would result in higher costs, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig. vice
president for public affairs.
Administrators said they could not
even estimate the additional cost be
cause the bill does not specify actual
rules and regulations.
The bill. H.R. 41, was introduced the
first day of the new Congress by Rep.
Charles Wilson (D-Ha'wthorne).
It is designed to inform prospective
donors of how their money is being
spent. The proposal responds to a
number of questionable uses of funds
received by charities, according to
Robert Preelen, director of goyernment
relations here.
Missionary group
Freelen cited the example of the Pal
lottine Fathers, a missionary group
from Baltimore, which apparently
used less than five per certt of over $20
million of donations for the stated
charitable purpose.
Other examples of misuse exist,
Freelen said. Rosenzweig agreed, but
said "there are lots of abuses in the
world which can't be solved or
shouldn't be solved by legislation."
Rosenzweig said criminals are not
asked to report their activities. Rather,
the proper officials formulate a case
against the individual and prosecute
them. A similar policing method
should be used with unethical fun
draising outfits, he said.
Wilson, on theother hand, called the

proposal "among the most important
pieces of consumer legislation to be
considered by the 95th Congress," in
an "extension of remarks" in Congres
sional Record Jan. 4.
'Our spirit'
Wilson said he felt "strong volun
tary support for philanthropic enter
prises is one of the best indications of
our spirit as a nation." He said, though,
that since $29 billion was given to
charities last year, safeguarding regu
lations are needed.
Under the bill, charities would have

to include in its mail solicitations:
—the percentage of all contributions
which remained for direct application
to the charitable purpose after deduct
ing fundraising and management and
general costs:
—the purpose of the solicitation and
the intended use of tlie contribution;
and
—the right of the contributor to re
quest a complete financial report
which the organization would be re
quired to forward.
The bill would place compliance

under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Postal Service, and the Post Office
would have the power to establish ac
counting methods to be used to assure
compliance.
The bill would not apply to mem
bers of the organization in question.
Alumni, students, faculty, members of
governing boards and appointed
committees of a college or university
and members of their families are con
sidered members of the University.
