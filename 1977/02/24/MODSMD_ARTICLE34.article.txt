Rhodesia will liberalize race laws
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith
proposed a major lifting of Rhodesian race laws yes
terday as the government said large numbers of
whites continue to flee the country's escalating guer
rilla war.
The announcement cameas thegovernment listed
15 deaths in violence since Tuesday, and two black
Roman Catholic priests were jailed for not informing
on guerrillas.
Smith said Rhodesia would let blacks become
military officers starting in June, let them buy fac
tories and businesses in commercial areas, buy farms
in about a third of previously white territory, and
would try to bring more blacks into the government
at all levels.
The government said yesterday that 1414 of
Rhodesia's roughly 270,()()() whites emigrated last
month and only 443 came into the country. A year
earlier, Rhodesia lost 1018 citizens, but it gained
1040.
Smith said his government wanted "to work with
our black people in order to produce the correct
political solution for our future."
Smith said medical institutions would stay segre
gated. White suburbs could stay closed to blacks
under a provision letting municipalities decide
which residential areas would be opened 10 blacks.
Bank robbers take over $1 million
Yonkers, N.Y. — Two robbers who invaded the
Hudson Valley National Bank here made off with
more than $1 million, an FBI agent said yesterday. It
was oneof thebiggest bank robberies in U.S. history.
Bank officials refused to say how much was taken,
but Robert Besley, the agent in charge of the FBI
office in nearby New Rochelle, said. "It is safe to
assume that more than $1 million" was taken.
Besley said all the money deposited by Yonkers
Raceway at the bank from its three-day holiday
weekend of races was stolen Tuesday morning. A
bank official confirmed Beslev's statement.

Besley estimated the track's share of the money bet
on the three racing nights in question would exceed
$500,000 and that there would have been additional
money from such things as horsemen's fees.
Using Besley's calculations, that would mean the
track's weekend deposit could easily exceed $1.2
million.
Some sources, including federal authorities, indi
cate that if the amount of cash involved approaches
or exceeds $1 million, it would be the biggest cash
robbery of a bank in U.S. history.
There have been bigger non-cash bank robberies,
including the theft of $3.3 million in jewels and
other valuables from a Southern California bank in
1972.
Burns gives economic predictions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's proposed
additions to the 1978 federal budget could drive
inflation this year above the expected 5-6 per cent
rate, Chairman Arthur Burns of the Federal Reserve
Board said yesterday.
The Carter administration is projecting a 5.3 per
cent hike in consumer prices this year. Burns indi
cated he thinks that is the minimum possible, and
that it could be higher.
But Burns said Carter probably could achieve his
other economic targets for economic growth of six
per cent and an unemployment rate of below seven
per cent.
Burns said he supports the concept of having big
business advise the government in advance of plans
to increase prices. He said it is not so important for
unions to do this for wages, since the government
already knows when major labor contracts are expir
ing.
But he said the time for putting such a program
into effect may not be right. "1 do believe there is a
time for everything . . . it seems doubtful to me this is
the right time to stir up that issue," he said.
Amin claims he defeated coup plot
Kampala, Uganda — President Idi Amin claimed

yesterday that an alleged plot he crushed last week
was to have climaxed with an airborne landing of
paratroopers from the United States, Britain or Israel.
In Dares Salaam, the capital of neighboring Tan
zania, a group of 22 refugees arriving from Uganda
claimed Amin had launched a nationwide massacre
of two predominantly Christian tribes, the Langi and
Acholi, he believes were central to the coup attempt.
Amin told correspondents that 1(> persons arrested
for arms smuggling in connection with the plot had
disclosed under interrogation that the uprising was
to have started with the assassination of prominent
Ugandan leaders.
In the ensuing turmoil, paratroopers were to fly in
from an aircraft carrier of undisclosed nationality
and capture several towns in Uganda, he said.
A U.S. State Department spokesman termed "ab
surd" allegations that the United States was support
ing a plot aimed at Amin. No comment was im
mediately available from British or Israeli spokes
men.

Besley estimated the track's share of the money bet
on the three racing nights in question would exceed
$500,000 and that there would have been additional
money from such things as horsemen's fees.
Using Besley's calculations, that would mean the
track's weekend deposit could easily exceed $1.2
million.
Some sources, including federal authorities, indi
cate that if the amount of cash involved approaches
or exceeds $1 million, it would be the biggest cash
robbery of a bank in U.S. history.
There have been bigger non-cash bank robberies,
including the theft of $3.3 million in jewels and
other valuables from a Southern California bank in
1972.
Burns gives economic predictions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's proposed
additions to the 1978 federal budget could drive
inflation this year above the expected 5-6 per cent
rate, Chairman Arthur Burns of the Federal Reserve
Board said yesterday.
The Carter administration is projecting a 5.3 per
cent hike in consumer prices this year. Burns indi
cated he thinks that is the minimum possible, and
that it could be higher.
But Burns said Carter probably could achieve his
other economic targets for economic growth of six
per cent and an unemployment rate of below seven
per cent.
Burns said he supports the concept of having big
business advise the government in advance of plans
to increase prices. He said it is not so important for
unions to do this for wages, since the government
already knows when major labor contracts are expir
ing.
But he said the time for putting such a program
into effect may not be right. "1 do believe there is a
time for everything . . . it seems doubtful to me this is
the right time to stir up that issue," he said.
Amin claims he defeated coup plot
Kampala, Uganda — President Idi Amin claimed

yesterday that an alleged plot he crushed last week
was to have climaxed with an airborne landing of
paratroopers from the United States, Britain or Israel.
In Dares Salaam, the capital of neighboring Tan
zania, a group of 22 refugees arriving from Uganda
claimed Amin had launched a nationwide massacre
of two predominantly Christian tribes, the Langi and
Acholi, he believes were central to the coup attempt.
Amin told correspondents that 1(> persons arrested
for arms smuggling in connection with the plot had
disclosed under interrogation that the uprising was
to have started with the assassination of prominent
Ugandan leaders.
In the ensuing turmoil, paratroopers were to fly in
from an aircraft carrier of undisclosed nationality
and capture several towns in Uganda, he said.
A U.S. State Department spokesman termed "ab
surd" allegations that the United States was support
ing a plot aimed at Amin. No comment was im
mediately available from British or Israeli spokes
men.

Rhodesia will liberalize race laws
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith
proposed a major lifting of Rhodesian race laws yes
terday as the government said large numbers of
whites continue to flee the country's escalating guer
rilla war.
The announcement cameas thegovernment listed
15 deaths in violence since Tuesday, and two black
Roman Catholic priests were jailed for not informing
on guerrillas.
Smith said Rhodesia would let blacks become
military officers starting in June, let them buy fac
tories and businesses in commercial areas, buy farms
in about a third of previously white territory, and
would try to bring more blacks into the government
at all levels.
The government said yesterday that 1414 of
Rhodesia's roughly 270,()()() whites emigrated last
month and only 443 came into the country. A year
earlier, Rhodesia lost 1018 citizens, but it gained
1040.
Smith said his government wanted "to work with
our black people in order to produce the correct
political solution for our future."
Smith said medical institutions would stay segre
gated. White suburbs could stay closed to blacks
under a provision letting municipalities decide
which residential areas would be opened 10 blacks.
Bank robbers take over $1 million
Yonkers, N.Y. — Two robbers who invaded the
Hudson Valley National Bank here made off with
more than $1 million, an FBI agent said yesterday. It
was oneof thebiggest bank robberies in U.S. history.
Bank officials refused to say how much was taken,
but Robert Besley, the agent in charge of the FBI
office in nearby New Rochelle, said. "It is safe to
assume that more than $1 million" was taken.
Besley said all the money deposited by Yonkers
Raceway at the bank from its three-day holiday
weekend of races was stolen Tuesday morning. A
bank official confirmed Beslev's statement.

was to have climaxed with an airborne landing of
paratroopers from the United States, Britain or Israel.
In Dares Salaam, the capital of neighboring Tan
zania, a group of 22 refugees arriving from Uganda
claimed Amin had launched a nationwide massacre
of two predominantly Christian tribes, the Langi and
Acholi, he believes were central to the coup attempt.
Amin told correspondents that 1(> persons arrested
for arms smuggling in connection with the plot had
disclosed under interrogation that the uprising was
to have started with the assassination of prominent
Ugandan leaders.
In the ensuing turmoil, paratroopers were to fly in
from an aircraft carrier of undisclosed nationality
and capture several towns in Uganda, he said.
A U.S. State Department spokesman termed "ab
surd" allegations that the United States was support
ing a plot aimed at Amin. No comment was im
mediately available from British or Israeli spokes
men.

Rhodesia will liberalize race laws
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith
proposed a major lifting of Rhodesian race laws yes
terday as the government said large numbers of
whites continue to flee the country's escalating guer
rilla war.
The announcement cameas thegovernment listed
15 deaths in violence since Tuesday, and two black
Roman Catholic priests were jailed for not informing
on guerrillas.
Smith said Rhodesia would let blacks become
military officers starting in June, let them buy fac
tories and businesses in commercial areas, buy farms
in about a third of previously white territory, and
would try to bring more blacks into the government
at all levels.
The government said yesterday that 1414 of
Rhodesia's roughly 270,()()() whites emigrated last
month and only 443 came into the country. A year
earlier, Rhodesia lost 1018 citizens, but it gained
1040.
Smith said his government wanted "to work with
our black people in order to produce the correct
political solution for our future."
Smith said medical institutions would stay segre
gated. White suburbs could stay closed to blacks
under a provision letting municipalities decide
which residential areas would be opened 10 blacks.
Bank robbers take over $1 million
Yonkers, N.Y. — Two robbers who invaded the
Hudson Valley National Bank here made off with
more than $1 million, an FBI agent said yesterday. It
was oneof thebiggest bank robberies in U.S. history.
Bank officials refused to say how much was taken,
but Robert Besley, the agent in charge of the FBI
office in nearby New Rochelle, said. "It is safe to
assume that more than $1 million" was taken.
Besley said all the money deposited by Yonkers
Raceway at the bank from its three-day holiday
weekend of races was stolen Tuesday morning. A
bank official confirmed Beslev's statement.

Besley estimated the track's share of the money bet
on the three racing nights in question would exceed
$500,000 and that there would have been additional
money from such things as horsemen's fees.
Using Besley's calculations, that would mean the
track's weekend deposit could easily exceed $1.2
million.
Some sources, including federal authorities, indi
cate that if the amount of cash involved approaches
or exceeds $1 million, it would be the biggest cash
robbery of a bank in U.S. history.
There have been bigger non-cash bank robberies,
including the theft of $3.3 million in jewels and
other valuables from a Southern California bank in
1972.
Burns gives economic predictions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's proposed
additions to the 1978 federal budget could drive
inflation this year above the expected 5-6 per cent
rate, Chairman Arthur Burns of the Federal Reserve
Board said yesterday.
The Carter administration is projecting a 5.3 per
cent hike in consumer prices this year. Burns indi
cated he thinks that is the minimum possible, and
that it could be higher.
But Burns said Carter probably could achieve his
other economic targets for economic growth of six
per cent and an unemployment rate of below seven
per cent.
Burns said he supports the concept of having big
business advise the government in advance of plans
to increase prices. He said it is not so important for
unions to do this for wages, since the government
already knows when major labor contracts are expir
ing.
But he said the time for putting such a program
into effect may not be right. "1 do believe there is a
time for everything . . . it seems doubtful to me this is
the right time to stir up that issue," he said.
