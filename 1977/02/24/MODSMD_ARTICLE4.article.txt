The University voted last night in favor of a resolu
tion asking the J.P. Stevens Co. to disclose minority
employment information but decided to abstain
from voting on another resolution asking disclosure
of detailed wage and labor relations information,
according to Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsbiuger.
The decision to abstain from voting the 3000 share
proxy on the second proposal was made by Au
gsburger despite a motion approved U-2 by the pres
idential Commission on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR) yesterday. The motion asked the University to
support the disclosure of wage and labor informa
tion.
The resolutions were submitted to Stevens stoc
kholders by the lnterfaith Center on Corporate Re
sponsibility (ICCR), a coalition of churches which
hold stock in Stevens.
"The decision was made in great haste after an
inadequate opportunity to discuss the issue," said
Jill Nelson, third-year law student and C-IR member.
Nelson said the vote was taken 10 minutes after the
commission heard a presentation from members of
the Stanford Committee for Justice at J.P. Stevens.
The C-IR, an advisory group composed of stu
dents, faculty and alumni, unanimously backed dis

closure of minority and affirmative action data.
The Committee for Justice presented to the com
mission a statement and petitions signed in three
days by 1565 students and 69 faculty members. The
petition urged the University to vote against com
pany management on both issues.
"Detailed information on employe wages and be
nefits normally is not made public by major
employers to the extent urged by the ICCR nor is.it
generally required by law," said Augsburger.
"It may be provided in a lesser detail to unions
which have won employe recognition when this is
relevant to the collective bargaining process," Au
gsburger said.
None of Stevens' 44,000 employes are covered by a
uion contract, according to the Amalgamated Clo
thing and Textile Workers Union. The union is try
ing to organize workers in the Stevens plants located
mostly in North and South Carolina.
"We're very disappointed that in the face of the
show of overwhelming community support for the
two resolutions, in face of the favorable recommen
dation of the C-IR in face of all moral and legal
arguments that Mr. Augsburger would believe that
profitability alone is what he must be concerned
with." said Steve Vettel, Committee for Justice
member.

"The information requested in this proposal could
be used against the company by the union in its
organizing drive. Thus, it could be detrimental to
stockholders," Augsburger said.
"We do not as a matter of course, disclose salary
levels here at Stanford. If we propose that a company
do that, there would be a lot of disagreement at
Stanford about whether that was a good thing (to
do)," said Rodney Adams, director of finance and
ex-officio member of C-IR.
"The real reason why Augsburger voted as he did
was because he didn't want to be in a position of
having voted for this kind of disclosure, asking
another company to do what he wouldn't do here,"
said Peter Necarsulmer. member of Committee for
Justice.
Adams said the commission asked the University
to send a letter to Stevens "to express the concern
that the company was not complying with the laws
of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either
in fact or in spirit" and that the University encour
aged the company to comply with labor laws.
The University News Service reported that the
letter Augsburger will write would convey the con
cern expressed by students.
"The Committee for Justice plans to hold a noon
meeting today at Columbae House," said Vettel.
