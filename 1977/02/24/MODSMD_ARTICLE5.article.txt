# President absolves CIA; defends revised budget
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter put his stamp of ap
proval yesterday on all current CIA ac
tivities and said his review of news
reports that the CIA has secretly paid
millions of dollars to foreign leaders
has "not found anything illegal or im
proper."
Carter defended the $2.75-bi 11 ion
reduction in defense expenditures in
the revised budget he submitted to
Congress on Tuesday. But he said "1
can't sa£" whether next year's Penta
gon budget will be more.
The president promised to send
Congress his proposal for a new de
partment of energy "the first of next
week" and said he probably will pre
sent his comprehensive energy policy
in a speech to a joint session of Con
gress around April 20.
Carter said he has not reached any
decision on whether to go ahead with
production of the costly B-l bombers
but hopes to decide by May. "I have
serious questions whether the B-l
ought to be in the center of airborne
defense capability," he said.

Carter said he would be less likely to
order a production go-ahead if the
Soviet Union cooperates in "lessening
tensions."
The administration is analyzing the
pressures and problems of inflation,
and Carter will speak out on corrective
measures when that analysis is com
pleted. "I think rigid wage and price
guidelines are a mistake," he said.
But Carter said he will "retain the
option" of asking business and labor
for advance notice of wage or price
increases. He said the program would
be voluntary.
He said he prefers to have all public
elections federally financed, an exten
sion of the system by which the gov
ernment now pays for the presidential
election campaign.
End electoral college
Carter also said he favors eliminat
ing the electoral college and providing
"a simple way for American people
who are citizens and 18 years old to
register to vote."
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance's re
cent Middle East trip was "very suc

cessful," the president said. Vance re
ported to Carter on the trip during a
morning meeting with national sec
urity advisers.
Carter said he plans to see Aral) and
Israeli leaders in Washington starting
March 12 with Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. The White House later
said the proposed visit is planned for
March 7 and 8.
During his presidential campaign
Carter pledged he would provide full
public accountability of intelligence
abuses or mistakes.
'Won't happen again'
On Feb. 11, 1976, in Manchester,
N.H., Carter was quoted as saying: "It
the CIA ever makes a mistake, I'll be
the one, as president, to call a press
conference and I'll tell you and the
American people 'this is what hap
pened. these are the people who viol
ated the law, this is the punishment I
would recommend, this is the correc
tive action that needs to be taken, and I
promise you it won't happen again.' "
In reply to a question about news
paper accounts of secret CIA payments
to King Hussein of Jordan and other
foreign leaders totaling millions of
dollars in return for intelligence and
other advantages, Carter told yester
day's news conference:
"I have adopted a policy, which I am
not going to leave, of not commenting
directly on any specific CIA activity
... I have reviewed the more controv
ersial revelations that have been pub
licized in the last few days, some quite
erroneous, some with some degree of
accuracy.
"These same operations have been
reviewed by the Intelligence Oversight
Hoard, an independent board, and also
by my predecessor. President (Gerald)
Ford. 1 have not found anything illegal
or improper."

March 12 with Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. The White House later
said the proposed visit is planned for
March 7 and 8.
During his presidential campaign
Carter pledged he would provide full
public accountability of intelligence
abuses or mistakes.
'Won't happen again'
On Feb. 11, 1976, in Manchester,
N.H., Carter was quoted as saying: "It
the CIA ever makes a mistake, I'll be
the one, as president, to call a press
conference and I'll tell you and the
American people 'this is what hap
pened. these are the people who viol
ated the law, this is the punishment I
would recommend, this is the correc
tive action that needs to be taken, and I
promise you it won't happen again.' "
In reply to a question about news
paper accounts of secret CIA payments
to King Hussein of Jordan and other
foreign leaders totaling millions of
dollars in return for intelligence and
other advantages, Carter told yester
day's news conference:
"I have adopted a policy, which I am
not going to leave, of not commenting
directly on any specific CIA activity
... I have reviewed the more controv
ersial revelations that have been pub
licized in the last few days, some quite
erroneous, some with some degree of
accuracy.
"These same operations have been
reviewed by the Intelligence Oversight
Hoard, an independent board, and also
by my predecessor. President (Gerald)
Ford. 1 have not found anything illegal
or improper."
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter put his stamp of ap
proval yesterday on all current CIA ac
tivities and said his review of news
reports that the CIA has secretly paid
millions of dollars to foreign leaders
has "not found anything illegal or im
proper."
Carter defended the $2.75-bi 11 ion
reduction in defense expenditures in
the revised budget he submitted to
Congress on Tuesday. But he said "1
can't sa£" whether next year's Penta
gon budget will be more.
The president promised to send
Congress his proposal for a new de
partment of energy "the first of next
week" and said he probably will pre
sent his comprehensive energy policy
in a speech to a joint session of Con
gress around April 20.
Carter said he has not reached any
decision on whether to go ahead with
production of the costly B-l bombers
but hopes to decide by May. "I have
serious questions whether the B-l
ought to be in the center of airborne
defense capability," he said.

Carter said he would be less likely to
order a production go-ahead if the
Soviet Union cooperates in "lessening
tensions."
The administration is analyzing the
pressures and problems of inflation,
and Carter will speak out on corrective
measures when that analysis is com
pleted. "I think rigid wage and price
guidelines are a mistake," he said.
But Carter said he will "retain the
option" of asking business and labor
for advance notice of wage or price
increases. He said the program would
be voluntary.
He said he prefers to have all public
elections federally financed, an exten
sion of the system by which the gov
ernment now pays for the presidential
election campaign.
End electoral college
Carter also said he favors eliminat
ing the electoral college and providing
"a simple way for American people
who are citizens and 18 years old to
register to vote."
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance's re
cent Middle East trip was "very suc

cessful," the president said. Vance re
ported to Carter on the trip during a
morning meeting with national sec
urity advisers.
Carter said he plans to see Aral) and
Israeli leaders in Washington starting
March 12 with Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. The White House later
said the proposed visit is planned for
March 7 and 8.
