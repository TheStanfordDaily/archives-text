# Dolly candidate reveals inside story

(Editor's note: the author of this series has
asked to remain anonymous until after Dolly
tryouts are completed on Monday. She has
attended a number of workouts since tryouts
were announced in early February. Copy for
the article was edited by Mark Funk.)
Somebody asked me why I wanted to be
come "one of those tit-shaking, ass-wagging
Dollies." I don't. I tried out to see why some
people perceive the Dollies in those "terms."
And I wondered what motivated women to
try out for an organization which, rightly or
not, has been described as "five bubble
headed sexpots."
Next year's Dollies will be selected some
time Monday night. Practice sessions have
been going on for about three weeks, but even
now 1 may not have a clear answer to my
questions. All I can do is try to interpret sights
and sounds of the past few weeks.
Make of it what you will.
The Dollies are an institution; an indelible
part of the Stanford experience. They stand
with Hoover Tower and the sequoia as sym
bols of the University. In the campus pecking
order they rank somewhere below Richard
Lyman but are more recognizable than the
ASSU Council of Presidents.
No tryout and tell
Yet many women who went to the first
session hadn't even told friends they were
interested in trying out. There is a
generalized Dolly stereotype — at once social
and sexual — which inhibited many prospec
tive candidates from telling dormmates what
they were doing and untold others from even
going to the meetings.
I have not always been particularly high on
the Dollies. I was mad as hell last year when

an IM game 1 was playing in was suddenly
terminated with three minutes left on the
clock to make room for Dolly tryouts.
This year, the friend I went to tryouts with
said, "I just want to see the women who try
out. You know, the make-up-out-to-here
types." I guess that's just about what I ex
pected, too.
Two of this year's Dollies didn't tell people
they had tried out until after they had been
selected.
Mixed reactions
When 1 told some intimates of my plans,
their reactions ranged from,"I am glad you're
going out. They need good people to estab
lish a new image," to "Are you sure you
wouldn't change and become just like one of
them?"
Hut what is "one of them" like?
Before going to the first meeting, I had an
image of the "stereotypical" Dolly. Lynne
Preslo, Carrie Teagle, Cathie Pelton, Carla
Murray and Heidi Jacobson — the current
Dollies — took that stereotype and, figura
tively, danced all over it.
Meeting one was held in the Branner din
ing room. About 60 women showed up at the
session. Trite as it may sound, the women
who were trying out came in all shapes and
sizes. A few were very athletic looking like
they were members of the ski or swimming
team.
Common denominator
Most were dressed nicely, but that was
their only common denominator.
The Dollies told the women what it was
like to put up with the hell-raisin' anarchists
in the Band and stressed the huge amount of
time the women whoare selected will have to
commit to being a Dolly.
The Dollies even suggested that the women

begin applying vaseline to their upper gums.
It would, the Dollies claimed, facilitate smil
ing.
After this went on for a while, one of the
candidates asked, "How do you learn to cope
with the Dolly stereotype?" One of the Dol
lies replied. "I don't think we have a
stereotype. Do you?"
Most of the women thought that, yes in
deed, Dollies did have a stereotype.
Different perception
The conflict of opinion arose from a differ
ence in perception. "When you consider us
on an individual basis," the Dollies asserted,
"there is no stereotype." At the meeting, the
Dollies came across, as individual, assertive
women. They dealt with the question of
stereotypes in a positive, intelligent manner.
"People get to know you as an individual,"
one of them said.
But how often does the average student
here get a chance to meet Preslo, Teagle, Pel
ton, Murray or Jacobson on a personal level ?
The public perception of the Dollies is as a
dance team — five women kicking up their
heels to "Bill Tell" at a basketball game or
striding off with the Band to play at this or
that alumni get-together.
It would takeawfully long for five people to
get to know much of the student body here.
So, by sheer weight of numbers, the public
perception will probably survive.
It appears that the "bathroom mentality"
described by one Dolly as the clutch of
women in one dorm who gathered around a
try-out announcement sharpening their
fingernails, will continue.
The first meeting was enlightening. I didn't
learn why the women at the session were
trying out. But I gained some insight into why
many women dislike the "institution."
