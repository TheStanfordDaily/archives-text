## Opinions Abortion a personal decision 
### 
June Genis

1 agree with Doug Bandow (Daily
Feb. 16) that discussions on abortion
should not center around whether or
not a fetus is alive, and further that we
can not attempt to sidestep the moral
issue with utilitarian arguments.
However, 1 strongly disagree that the
moral issue involved is "killing versus
life," rather it is liberty versus slavery.
The issue is clarified if we replace
the term abortion with "fetal elimina
tion." The goal of abortion is not to
"kill" the fetus but to remove it from a
non-consenting female carrier. Rarely
does a pregnant woman actually seek
destruction of the fetus itself. She
seeks only to free herself from its un
desired parasitism.
This line of reasoning is usually
countered with an allegation that in
allowing herself to become pregnant a
woman has entered into an implied
contract with the fetus and is thus not
enslaved by it. Such arguments clearly
break down in the case of rape, forcing
proponents to fall back on utilitarian
arguments or to acknowledge the
legitimacy of abortion under limited
circumstances, a position inconsistent
with a moral stand rooted in the
supremacy of human life.
Personally, 1 believe that the ulti
mate solution to the "abortion issue"
lies in another area of legislation and
in technology. First, we should re
move all legal restraints on a woman's
right to transfer control of an un
wanted child, with or without com
pensation. Clearly the possibility of
compensation would prove an incen
tive for many women to carry an
otherwise unwanted fetus to term.
Most of the horror stories about "child
selling" result not from the nature
of the transaction but from the fact that
the semi-legal status of such acts often
forces women into dealing with brok
ers who are in a position to exploit
them.
A child who is adopted by parents
who truly want it, and have sufficient
means to pay an acquisition fee, surely
can't be worse off than an unwanted
child born into a family already pres
sed to support its existing members. Of
course the full human rights of any
child should be protected throughout
any siich transfer of authority and at all
ottter times — an area needing a lot
iijore attention in itself.
In the future I look to the develop
ment of techniques for removal of a
viable fetus and its culture outside the
original mother, either by transplant or

in artificial medium. Again, an
economic incentive — receiving com
pensation for a live fetus versus having
to pay for an abortion — would lead in
time to the voluntary elimination of
methods which result in fetal death.
The opponents of abortion serve a
valuable role in providing a pregnant
woman with information she should
consider in deciding on whether or not
to have an abortion, but the decision
must remain hers. The purpose of law

is to protect the basic right of all indi
viduals, male or female, to control
their own lives and consequently their
own bodies, The decision to have an
abortion should be left to moral sua
sion, not the capricious and shifting
attitude of legislatures.

the term abortion with "fetal elimina
tion." The goal of abortion is not to
"kill" the fetus but to remove it from a
non-consenting female carrier. Rarely
does a pregnant woman actually seek
destruction of the fetus itself. She
seeks only to free herself from its un
desired parasitism.
This line of reasoning is usually
countered with an allegation that in
allowing herself to become pregnant a
woman has entered into an implied
contract with the fetus and is thus not
enslaved by it. Such arguments clearly
break down in the case of rape, forcing
proponents to fall back on utilitarian
arguments or to acknowledge the
legitimacy of abortion under limited
circumstances, a position inconsistent
with a moral stand rooted in the
supremacy of human life.
Personally, 1 believe that the ulti
mate solution to the "abortion issue"
lies in another area of legislation and
in technology. First, we should re
move all legal restraints on a woman's
right to transfer control of an un
wanted child, with or without com
pensation. Clearly the possibility of
compensation would prove an incen
tive for many women to carry an
otherwise unwanted fetus to term.
Most of the horror stories about "child
selling" result not from the nature
of the transaction but from the fact that
the semi-legal status of such acts often
forces women into dealing with brok
ers who are in a position to exploit
them.
A child who is adopted by parents
who truly want it, and have sufficient
means to pay an acquisition fee, surely
can't be worse off than an unwanted
child born into a family already pres
sed to support its existing members. Of
course the full human rights of any
child should be protected throughout
any siich transfer of authority and at all
ottter times — an area needing a lot
iijore attention in itself.
In the future I look to the develop
ment of techniques for removal of a
viable fetus and its culture outside the
original mother, either by transplant or

in artificial medium. Again, an
economic incentive — receiving com
pensation for a live fetus versus having
to pay for an abortion — would lead in
time to the voluntary elimination of
methods which result in fetal death.
The opponents of abortion serve a
valuable role in providing a pregnant
woman with information she should
consider in deciding on whether or not
to have an abortion, but the decision
must remain hers. The purpose of law

is to protect the basic right of all indi
viduals, male or female, to control
their own lives and consequently their
own bodies, The decision to have an
abortion should be left to moral sua
sion, not the capricious and shifting
attitude of legislatures.

1 agree with Doug Bandow (Daily
Feb. 16) that discussions on abortion
should not center around whether or
not a fetus is alive, and further that we
can not attempt to sidestep the moral
issue with utilitarian arguments.
However, 1 strongly disagree that the
moral issue involved is "killing versus
life," rather it is liberty versus slavery.
The issue is clarified if we replace
the term abortion with "fetal elimina
