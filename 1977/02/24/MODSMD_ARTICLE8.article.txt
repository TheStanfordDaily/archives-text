# Affirmative action

At a time when the minority enrollment in schools such as Stanford is declin
ing at the graduate level, when women of all races and non-white men are
underrepresented at the faculty and high administrative levels but over
represented in low paying, low prestige jobs, when the nationwide percentage of
women professors has been dropping since 1920 — this is a time for university
affirmative action programs to be pursued with all vigor.
Recent statistics indicate that those groups to whom affirmative action is
addressed — all women and minority men — have not 'made' it. In the brief time
that the program has been in operation, no one would expect that suddenly
everything is all right. Because things are still not right, no case can be made for
shutting down such a program.
Instead, the institutions in this country must begin to expand and to extend
their fledgling affirmative action programs. In particular, much more serious
attempts must be made to recruit women and minority men for positions which
are traditionally atypical for such groups.
We must work to support and extend those programs which act to desegregate
institutions; we must have equal representation of all groups at all levels. As
horrifying as it may seem to those unenlightened, men must be trained in home
economics, and other non-traditional fields to become qualified for these jobs
and responsibilities, just as we train women to become engineers, lawyers,
doctors and other types of professionals.
The minority woman must be especially encouraged, recruited and trained for
positions she has been so vehemently excluded from in the past. She must not be
relegated to domestic service — either for the wealthy white family or the
minority man. The minority groups will have achieved little if only the minority
men are those who are integrated into the mainstream of this society.
Since the beginning of affirmative action in the early,l97os, some advances
have been made. These advances must continue and be enhanced.
Lest we forget, it was during the '60s that the poor and disadvantaged, the
minority civil rights groups, and the women's movement, along with the popu
lar movements against the Indochinese War, brought to a height the demands for
justice, equal-representation, and above all—change. In response to these
movements, the government instituted many reformist measures. One of the
results is the present affirmative action program.
The Bakke decision, in surfacing at this time, acts to reinforce the basic
distrust that all disadvantaged and disenfrancised people hold in reference to
reformist measures. If theßnkke decision is affirmed, then a case can be made for
the concept of "reverse" discrimination — the key word used by those oppo
nents of affirmative action. If the institutions of this country begin to slow
down, or to even go so far as to shut down their programs, then those who fought
so hard for these measures will certainly return to fight even harder. And this
time around, no reformist measure will be accepted.
