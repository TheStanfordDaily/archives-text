IM leagues
After watching the Intramural bas
ketball games, I can see why the
players are asking for a new league.
As it stands now there are three
leagues: the A league for the strongest
teams, B league for teams which are
not as strong, and for teams which are
playing for the fun of playing, the C
league. All of the leagues are co-ed
though almost all A and B league
teams are entirely male.
In comparing the scores in the A
league there comes to light a wide
point spread between continuously
winning and continuously losing
teams. It is disheartening for the teams
on the bottom to know they will stay
there because most of their com
petitors are stronger than they are.
The B league is the largest league
and covers a much wider scope of ta
lent. I,ike the A league there are the
teams which always dominate in the B
league. The teams at the bottom of the
A league are closer in caliber of talent
to the top teams in the B league.
To make it more fun for the stronger
and weaker teams alike, I propose the
forming of a fourth league. It could be
placed between the A and B leagues
already in existence. The new league
would includethe lower scoring teams
of the A league and the higher scoring
teams from the B league. The players
would have more fun playing against
teams nearer their own level. It would
give teams a chance to win once in
awhile and not always be defeated.

Progress report
Congratulations are in order for the
administration of Stanford University.
In the short span of three years they
have practically accomplished the
goal set forward in the letter from the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, James
Gibbs to the Director of Financial Aids,
Robert Huff. Gibbs proposed that the
University rid itself of high orofile,
low income blacks, and replare them
with low-profile, high income blacks.
This plan, which is not only pertinent
to Macks, but other minorities as well,
is rapidly entering its final stages of
completion.
In the past few weeks there has been
<i drive for a $200 increase in self-help
expectations for students on financial

aid. This means that students on fi
nancial aid will have to raise an extra
$200, separate from the amount con
tributed by their parents or earned
from a summer job. In defense of this
proposal Huff states that, in economic
terms, the student population here
"does not in any way replicate na
tional norms"and that "income levels,
including those of minorities, tend to
be higher" than those at most other
schools (Daily, Feb. 15).
The fact is that due to the racist na
ture of this society most of the minority
population is economically disadvan
taged. So logically, the greater number
of minority students enrolled should
be from the lower income levels. The
disproportionate numbers of middle
and upper income level minorities
presently enrolled show how success
ful the University has been since elect
ing to pursue its ""negative action"
program.
The proposed increase in self-help
will insure that fewer financially dis
advantaged minority students enroll.
Stanford does not want the more rep
resentative minority students because
they usually tend to be socially con
scientious and thus are, Gibbs put it,
"the most vocal and persistant critics
of Stanford as an alien, non-relevant
educational institution."
Stanford's recent actions do not
seem outrageous in the light of present
social trends. What is outrageous is
that in this age of apathy and benign
neglect, we are condoning the sys
tematic elimination of the hard fought
civil-rights gains of the past two de
cades.

Mark Mancall, director of the Over
seas Studies Office is quoted as saying
in regard to the Berlin Program, "If in
the future we can find funds to reopen
Berlin, I personally see no reason we
shouldn't reopen Berlin." (Daily, Feb.
22).
Assuming this quotation to be cor
rect at least in import, I cannot help but
ask, "Does Mr. Mancall really believe
that once the Berlin program has been
terminated, the city of Berlin's offer of
financial assistance and the use of the
Villa Muthesius rejected, the faculty
and staff of the Berlin program dismis

sed or relocated, the books, office
materials, etc. of the office sold or
shipped back to California, working
ties with the government and people of
Berlin cut that the University will ever
seriously consider making the great in
itial expenditure of money and energy
to reopen the program?"
I think I understand Mancall's posi
tion in this dilemma. When in
Beutelsbach last winter to explain the
closure of that program to the students
there, Mancall made many similar
statements about the Beutelsbach
program in attempts to pacify the
rather angry students and to defend his
position.
It was then that I began to realize that
the director of Overseas Studies is in
capable of exercising any meaningful
influence on the policies of this Uni
versity. The budget of the Overseas
Studies is decided by the Provost and
his office, and what Mancall and the
Overseas Studies people say seems to
be given only superficial considera
tion.
Surely Mancall more than anyone at
Stanford must have the foresight to
recognize what is happening in this
University? It is quite clear that the
Overseas Studies, once an important
and vital expression of the "Stanford
Philosophy of Education" is becoming
but another (tokenism) here. The
University is finding it easier to be a
renowned center of post-graduate
studies and research in the sciences,
law and business than a university de
voted to opening students — both
graduate and undergraduate — to the
limitless possibilities of the world we
live in.
This University is not a "victim" of
finance. If Stanford still held to its
founding educational philosophy, a
way would be found to keep and
perhaps even strengthen the Overseas
Studies and other slowly decaying
undergraduate departments despite
"hard times."

Rejuvenating review
I personally wish to thank the Daily
for the job done on Manzanita Park's
first play, Applause. It is very dif
ficult to recall any previous review

written in a similar vein. Therefore, I
feel it can be assumed that the
aforementioned article isunique in na
ture. In particular, among the cast
members the common opinion was an
expressive disbelief as to the undeni
able mediocrity of the story.
As a member of said cast, I feel it my
duty to stand up for the authoress of
that review and the remainder of the
staff of the Daily. Allow me to point
out that if the review hadn't been writ
ten in such a snide and naive way it
never would have been able to gener
ate the widespread emotions of the
cast, which enabled them to sustain
the high energy level throughout the
run of the play.
Without this antipathetic reaction,
the three packed-to-the-brim audi
ences might not have seen that lively
display of enthusiasm, which marked
this year's top dramatic production to
date. Spurred on by those dry, color
less ravings, the entire cast reached the
perfect blending point of profes
sionalism and group empathy, which
resulted in thunderous applause every
night.
At the end of the final performance
the depth of common feeling of those
involved in the play was expressed by
the actions'of one girl, when she vic
toriously tore the article into shreds.
I'm proud to have been a part of such a
group.
So once again, thank you Daily. We
couldn't have done it without you.

I read with amazement the note fol
lowing Charlie Hall's letter (Daily,
Feb. 17) in which was stated, "It is not
the opinion editors' responsibility to
edit for content." Do you seriously be
lieve that the opinion editors' respon
sibility is simply to correct spelling
and grammatical errors and to lay out
the page? The error to which Hall re
fers was central to the argument of the
editorial. By denying any responsibil

IM leagues
After watching the Intramural bas
ketball games, I can see why the
players are asking for a new league.
As it stands now there are three
leagues: the A league for the strongest
teams, B league for teams which are
not as strong, and for teams which are
playing for the fun of playing, the C
league. All of the leagues are co-ed
though almost all A and B league
teams are entirely male.
In comparing the scores in the A
league there comes to light a wide
point spread between continuously
winning and continuously losing
teams. It is disheartening for the teams
on the bottom to know they will stay
there because most of their com
petitors are stronger than they are.
The B league is the largest league
and covers a much wider scope of ta
lent. I,ike the A league there are the
teams which always dominate in the B
league. The teams at the bottom of the
A league are closer in caliber of talent
to the top teams in the B league.
To make it more fun for the stronger
and weaker teams alike, I propose the
forming of a fourth league. It could be
placed between the A and B leagues
already in existence. The new league
would includethe lower scoring teams
of the A league and the higher scoring
teams from the B league. The players
would have more fun playing against
teams nearer their own level. It would
give teams a chance to win once in
awhile and not always be defeated.

Progress report
Congratulations are in order for the
administration of Stanford University.
In the short span of three years they
have practically accomplished the
goal set forward in the letter from the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, James
Gibbs to the Director of Financial Aids,
Robert Huff. Gibbs proposed that the
University rid itself of high orofile,
low income blacks, and replare them
with low-profile, high income blacks.
This plan, which is not only pertinent
to Macks, but other minorities as well,
is rapidly entering its final stages of
completion.
In the past few weeks there has been
<i drive for a $200 increase in self-help
expectations for students on financial

aid. This means that students on fi
nancial aid will have to raise an extra
$200, separate from the amount con
tributed by their parents or earned
from a summer job. In defense of this
proposal Huff states that, in economic
terms, the student population here
"does not in any way replicate na
tional norms"and that "income levels,
including those of minorities, tend to
be higher" than those at most other
schools (Daily, Feb. 15).
The fact is that due to the racist na
ture of this society most of the minority
population is economically disadvan
taged. So logically, the greater number
of minority students enrolled should
be from the lower income levels. The
disproportionate numbers of middle
and upper income level minorities
presently enrolled show how success
ful the University has been since elect
ing to pursue its ""negative action"
program.
The proposed increase in self-help
will insure that fewer financially dis
advantaged minority students enroll.
Stanford does not want the more rep
resentative minority students because
they usually tend to be socially con
scientious and thus are, Gibbs put it,
"the most vocal and persistant critics
of Stanford as an alien, non-relevant
educational institution."
Stanford's recent actions do not
seem outrageous in the light of present
social trends. What is outrageous is
that in this age of apathy and benign
neglect, we are condoning the sys
tematic elimination of the hard fought
civil-rights gains of the past two de

Mark Mancall, director of the Over
seas Studies Office is quoted as saying
in regard to the Berlin Program, "If in
the future we can find funds to reopen
Berlin, I personally see no reason we
shouldn't reopen Berlin." (Daily, Feb.
22).
Assuming this quotation to be cor
rect at least in import, I cannot help but
ask, "Does Mr. Mancall really believe
that once the Berlin program has been
terminated, the city of Berlin's offer of
financial assistance and the use of the
Villa Muthesius rejected, the faculty
and staff of the Berlin program dismis

sed or relocated, the books, office
materials, etc. of the office sold or
shipped back to California, working
ties with the government and people of
Berlin cut that the University will ever
seriously consider making the great in
itial expenditure of money and energy
to reopen the program?"
I think I understand Mancall's posi
tion in this dilemma. When in
Beutelsbach last winter to explain the
closure of that program to the students
there, Mancall made many similar
statements about the Beutelsbach
program in attempts to pacify the
rather angry students and to defend his
position.
It was then that I began to realize that
the director of Overseas Studies is in
capable of exercising any meaningful
influence on the policies of this Uni
versity. The budget of the Overseas
Studies is decided by the Provost and
his office, and what Mancall and the
Overseas Studies people say seems to
be given only superficial considera
tion.
Surely Mancall more than anyone at
Stanford must have the foresight to
recognize what is happening in this
University? It is quite clear that the
Overseas Studies, once an important
and vital expression of the "Stanford
Philosophy of Education" is becoming
but another (tokenism) here. The
University is finding it easier to be a
renowned center of post-graduate
studies and research in the sciences,
law and business than a university de
voted to opening students — both
graduate and undergraduate — to the
limitless possibilities of the world we
live in.
This University is not a "victim" of
finance. If Stanford still held to its
founding educational philosophy, a
way would be found to keep and
perhaps even strengthen the Overseas
Studies and other slowly decaying
undergraduate departments despite
"hard times."

out that if the review hadn't been writ

Rejuvenating review
I personally wish to thank the Daily
for the job done on Manzanita Park's
first play, Applause. It is very dif
ficult to recall any previous review

written in a similar vein. Therefore, I
feel it can be assumed that the
aforementioned article isunique in na
ture. In particular, among the cast
members the common opinion was an
expressive disbelief as to the undeni
able mediocrity of the story.
As a member of said cast, I feel it my
duty to stand up for the authoress of
that review and the remainder of the
staff of the Daily. Allow me to point
out that if the review hadn't been writ
ten in such a snide and naive way it
never would have been able to gener
ate the widespread emotions of the
cast, which enabled them to sustain
the high energy level throughout the
run of the play.
Without this antipathetic reaction,
the three packed-to-the-brim audi
ences might not have seen that lively
display of enthusiasm, which marked
this year's top dramatic production to
date. Spurred on by those dry, color
less ravings, the entire cast reached the
perfect blending point of profes
sionalism and group empathy, which
resulted in thunderous applause every
night.
At the end of the final performance
the depth of common feeling of those
involved in the play was expressed by
the actions'of one girl, when she vic

I'm proud to have been a part of such a

IM leagues
After watching the Intramural bas
ketball games, I can see why the
players are asking for a new league.
As it stands now there are three
leagues: the A league for the strongest
teams, B league for teams which are
not as strong, and for teams which are
playing for the fun of playing, the C
league. All of the leagues are co-ed
though almost all A and B league
teams are entirely male.
In comparing the scores in the A
league there comes to light a wide
point spread between continuously
winning and continuously losing
teams. It is disheartening for the teams
on the bottom to know they will stay
there because most of their com
petitors are stronger than they are.
The B league is the largest league
and covers a much wider scope of ta
lent. I,ike the A league there are the
teams which always dominate in the B
league. The teams at the bottom of the
A league are closer in caliber of talent
to the top teams in the B league.
To make it more fun for the stronger
and weaker teams alike, I propose the
forming of a fourth league. It could be
placed between the A and B leagues
already in existence. The new league
would includethe lower scoring teams
of the A league and the higher scoring
teams from the B league. The players
would have more fun playing against
teams nearer their own level. It would
give teams a chance to win once in
awhile and not always be defeated.

Progress report
Congratulations are in order for the
administration of Stanford University.
In the short span of three years they
have practically accomplished the
goal set forward in the letter from the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, James
Gibbs to the Director of Financial Aids,
Robert Huff. Gibbs proposed that the
University rid itself of high orofile,
low income blacks, and replare them
with low-profile, high income blacks.
This plan, which is not only pertinent
to Macks, but other minorities as well,
is rapidly entering its final stages of
completion.
In the past few weeks there has been
<i drive for a $200 increase in self-help
expectations for students on financial

aid. This means that students on fi
nancial aid will have to raise an extra
$200, separate from the amount con
tributed by their parents or earned
from a summer job. In defense of this
proposal Huff states that, in economic
terms, the student population here
"does not in any way replicate na
tional norms"and that "income levels,
including those of minorities, tend to
be higher" than those at most other
schools (Daily, Feb. 15).
The fact is that due to the racist na
ture of this society most of the minority
population is economically disadvan
taged. So logically, the greater number
of minority students enrolled should
be from the lower income levels. The
disproportionate numbers of middle
and upper income level minorities
presently enrolled show how success
ful the University has been since elect
ing to pursue its ""negative action"
program.
The proposed increase in self-help
will insure that fewer financially dis
advantaged minority students enroll.
Stanford does not want the more rep
resentative minority students because
they usually tend to be socially con
scientious and thus are, Gibbs put it,
"the most vocal and persistant critics
of Stanford as an alien, non-relevant
educational institution."
Stanford's recent actions do not
seem outrageous in the light of present
social trends. What is outrageous is
that in this age of apathy and benign
neglect, we are condoning the sys

civil-rights gains of the past two de

Mark Mancall, director of the Over
seas Studies Office is quoted as saying
in regard to the Berlin Program, "If in
the future we can find funds to reopen
Berlin, I personally see no reason we
shouldn't reopen Berlin." (Daily, Feb.
22).
Assuming this quotation to be cor
rect at least in import, I cannot help but
ask, "Does Mr. Mancall really believe
that once the Berlin program has been
terminated, the city of Berlin's offer of
financial assistance and the use of the
Villa Muthesius rejected, the faculty
and staff of the Berlin program dismis

sed or relocated, the books, office
materials, etc. of the office sold or
shipped back to California, working
ties with the government and people of
Berlin cut that the University will ever
seriously consider making the great in
itial expenditure of money and energy
to reopen the program?"
I think I understand Mancall's posi
tion in this dilemma. When in
Beutelsbach last winter to explain the
closure of that program to the students
there, Mancall made many similar
statements about the Beutelsbach
program in attempts to pacify the
rather angry students and to defend his
position.
It was then that I began to realize that
the director of Overseas Studies is in
capable of exercising any meaningful
influence on the policies of this Uni
versity. The budget of the Overseas
Studies is decided by the Provost and
his office, and what Mancall and the
Overseas Studies people say seems to
be given only superficial considera
tion.
Surely Mancall more than anyone at
Stanford must have the foresight to
recognize what is happening in this
University? It is quite clear that the
Overseas Studies, once an important
and vital expression of the "Stanford

but another (tokenism) here. The

rect at least in import, I cannot help but
ask, "Does Mr. Mancall really believe
that once the Berlin program has been
terminated, the city of Berlin's offer of
financial assistance and the use of the
Villa Muthesius rejected, the faculty
and staff of the Berlin program dismis

sed or relocated, the books, office
materials, etc. of the office sold or
shipped back to California, working
ties with the government and people of
Berlin cut that the University will ever
seriously consider making the great in
itial expenditure of money and energy
to reopen the program?"
I think I understand Mancall's posi
tion in this dilemma. When in
Beutelsbach last winter to explain the
closure of that program to the students
there, Mancall made many similar
statements about the Beutelsbach
program in attempts to pacify the
rather angry students and to defend his
position.
It was then that I began to realize that
the director of Overseas Studies is in
capable of exercising any meaningful
influence on the policies of this Uni
versity. The budget of the Overseas
Studies is decided by the Provost and
his office, and what Mancall and the
Overseas Studies people say seems to
be given only superficial considera
tion.
Surely Mancall more than anyone at
Stanford must have the foresight to
recognize what is happening in this
University? It is quite clear that the
Overseas Studies, once an important
and vital expression of the "Stanford
Philosophy of Education" is becoming
but another (tokenism) here. The
University is finding it easier to be a
renowned center of post-graduate
studies and research in the sciences,
law and business than a university de
voted to opening students — both
graduate and undergraduate — to the
limitless possibilities of the world we
live in.
This University is not a "victim" of
finance. If Stanford still held to its
founding educational philosophy, a
way would be found to keep and
perhaps even strengthen the Overseas
Studies and other slowly decaying
undergraduate departments despite
"hard times."

Rejuvenating review
I personally wish to thank the Daily
for the job done on Manzanita Park's
first play, Applause. It is very dif
ficult to recall any previous review

written in a similar vein. Therefore, I
feel it can be assumed that the
aforementioned article isunique in na
ture. In particular, among the cast
members the common opinion was an
expressive disbelief as to the undeni
able mediocrity of the story.
As a member of said cast, I feel it my
duty to stand up for the authoress of
that review and the remainder of the
staff of the Daily. Allow me to point
out that if the review hadn't been writ
ten in such a snide and naive way it
never would have been able to gener
ate the widespread emotions of the
cast, which enabled them to sustain
the high energy level throughout the
run of the play.
Without this antipathetic reaction,
the three packed-to-the-brim audi
ences might not have seen that lively
display of enthusiasm, which marked
this year's top dramatic production to
date. Spurred on by those dry, color
less ravings, the entire cast reached the
perfect blending point of profes
sionalism and group empathy, which
resulted in thunderous applause every
night.
At the end of the final performance
the depth of common feeling of those
involved in the play was expressed by
the actions'of one girl, when she vic
toriously tore the article into shreds.
I'm proud to have been a part of such a
group.
So once again, thank you Daily. We
couldn't have done it without you.

I read with amazement the note fol

the opinion editors' responsibility to
edit for content." Do you seriously be
lieve that the opinion editors' respon

the page? The error to which Hall re

IM leagues
After watching the Intramural bas
ketball games, I can see why the
players are asking for a new league.
As it stands now there are three
leagues: the A league for the strongest
teams, B league for teams which are
not as strong, and for teams which are
playing for the fun of playing, the C
league. All of the leagues are co-ed
though almost all A and B league
teams are entirely male.
In comparing the scores in the A
league there comes to light a wide
point spread between continuously
winning and continuously losing
teams. It is disheartening for the teams
on the bottom to know they will stay
there because most of their com
petitors are stronger than they are.
The B league is the largest league
and covers a much wider scope of ta
lent. I,ike the A league there are the
teams which always dominate in the B
league. The teams at the bottom of the
A league are closer in caliber of talent
to the top teams in the B league.
To make it more fun for the stronger
and weaker teams alike, I propose the
forming of a fourth league. It could be
placed between the A and B leagues
already in existence. The new league
would includethe lower scoring teams
of the A league and the higher scoring
teams from the B league. The players
would have more fun playing against
teams nearer their own level. It would
give teams a chance to win once in
awhile and not always be defeated.

Progress report
Congratulations are in order for the
administration of Stanford University.
In the short span of three years they
have practically accomplished the
goal set forward in the letter from the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, James
Gibbs to the Director of Financial Aids,
Robert Huff. Gibbs proposed that the
University rid itself of high orofile,
low income blacks, and replare them
with low-profile, high income blacks.
This plan, which is not only pertinent
to Macks, but other minorities as well,
is rapidly entering its final stages of
completion.
In the past few weeks there has been
<i drive for a $200 increase in self-help
expectations for students on financial

aid. This means that students on fi
nancial aid will have to raise an extra
$200, separate from the amount con
tributed by their parents or earned
from a summer job. In defense of this
proposal Huff states that, in economic
terms, the student population here
"does not in any way replicate na
tional norms"and that "income levels,
including those of minorities, tend to
be higher" than those at most other
schools (Daily, Feb. 15).
The fact is that due to the racist na
ture of this society most of the minority
population is economically disadvan
taged. So logically, the greater number
of minority students enrolled should
be from the lower income levels. The
disproportionate numbers of middle
and upper income level minorities
presently enrolled show how success
ful the University has been since elect
ing to pursue its ""negative action"
program.
The proposed increase in self-help
will insure that fewer financially dis
advantaged minority students enroll.
Stanford does not want the more rep
resentative minority students because
they usually tend to be socially con
scientious and thus are, Gibbs put it,
"the most vocal and persistant critics
of Stanford as an alien, non-relevant
educational institution."
Stanford's recent actions do not
seem outrageous in the light of present
social trends. What is outrageous is
that in this age of apathy and benign
neglect, we are condoning the sys
tematic elimination of the hard fought
civil-rights gains of the past two de
cades.
