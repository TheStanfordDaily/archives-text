English titles.
In 16th-century Prague, a rabbi invokes his magical powers to
protect local Jews against a pogrom. He brings to life a monstrous
clay figure, dressed in the common clothes of a guildsman, with a
Star of David pinned on his chest. This 1920 German classic is the
best-known version of the Golem myth and a landmark of fantasy on
the screen. This production greatly influenced James Whale's 1931
classic FRANKENSTEIN.
