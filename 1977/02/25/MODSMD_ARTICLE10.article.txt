# The
						law and the profits

Necarsulmer et at.

Community sentiment on important
issues obviously carries about as much
weight with profit-minded University
administrators as the recommenda
tions of their own advisory commis
sions.
In his decision Wednesday to abs
tain from voting Stanford's shares af
firmatively on an extremely innocuous
corporate responsibility resolution at
the upcoming annual meeting of J.P.
Stevens Co., Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance Robert Augsburger
demonstrated a callous disregard for
law, morality, overwhelming commun
ity support and his own Commission
of Investment Responsibility (C-IR).
In less than three days, over 1600
students signed a petition urging the
University not to abdicate its moral re
sponsibilities by abstaining or voting
no on two Interfaith Center on Corpo
rate Responsibility (ICCR) proxy re
solutions. One of these resolutions
calls on the company to disclose in
formation concerning its affirmative
action policies. The other asks that the
company disclose information con
cerning its labor practices and to direct
its management to comply with the let
ter and spirit of the National Labor Re
lations Act.
Apparently for nought, 70 faculty
members signed a letter similar to the
student petition and the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents issued a strong en
dorsement of the two proposals as did
the Daily. Moreover, after hearing the
arguments of both Augsburger and the
Stanford Committee for Justice at J.P.
Stevens, the C-IR — a body composed
of faculty, alumni and students —
voted to advise Augsburger to put
Stanford on the record supporting law
and justice by voting in favor of the
resolutions. Finally, a number of
alumni and at least one major donor to
Stanford signed the petition.
Nevertheless, Augsburger chose pro
fits over people.
Upstanding groups and institutions,
including The New York Times and
Business Week magazine, have charac
terized the world's second largest tex
tile manufacturer, J.P. Stevens, as the
nation's number one corporate outlaw.
The National Labor Relations Board
(NCRB) has found Stevens guilty of 15
separate cases of "unfair labor prac

tices" since 1965.
Stevens meets employe efforts to re
ctify working conditions with lock
outs, wiretapping, firings, bad faith
bargaining, intimidation and factory
shutdowns. The company breaks the
law wholesale and consciously, pre
ferring to pay small NLRB fines rather
than comply with long established
rules of employer-employe relations.
The real issue is not profitability per
se, but the fact that J.P. Stevens profits
come directly out of illegality.
Stanford would not be alone in sup
porting the struggle for justice at J.P.
Stevens. A broad coalition of Southern
leaders, including Atlanta mayor
Maynard Jackson, have formed the
Southerners for Economic Justice
committee in support of Stevens
workers. The Carnegie Corporation,
which holds over $3 million worth of
Stevens stock, is supporting both ICCR
resolutions.
When the requirements of the Uni
versity's financial security reach the
point of contradicting or negating the
ideas and arguments that an institu
tion of higher learning must convey, it
is indeed a sad day for Stanford.
Neither this University nor any uni
versity can exist in a moral vacuum.
But this is exactly what Augsburger
has hypocritically attempted to do.
Apparently, he feels that Stanford does
not have to come to terms with former
NLRB Chairman Boyd Leedom's
statement that "J.P. Stevens is so out of
tune with a humane, civilized ap
proach to industrial relations that it
would shock even those least sensitive
to honor, justice and decent treat
ment."
Why, one must ask, does Stanford
even bother to play the morality game?
Why does Stanford have an advisory
Commission of Investment Responsi
bility when its recommendations are
ignored?
It seems clear that the University's
position as a moral leader is operative
only when its own narrow interests are
not involved; that Augsburger's and
the University's concern is with pro
fitability, not with obeying the law or
promoting justice.
Our conscience as citizens and
human beings prevents us from ac-

quiescing to this hypocrisy. We intend
to continue to fight until the March 1
shareholders' meeting to reverse this
decision, which we feel reflects as
much upon the Stanford community at
large as on Augsburger.
To this end, a noon rally and march
will be held on Monday, Feb. 28 in
White Plaza to protest the University's
action. We hope that the conscience of
the entire community will motivate it
to participate.
