# Death of Dead Week
## 
### 
All over campus, people read the
shocking obituary. "Dead Week, 71,
died today from injuries sustained
from multiple assaults by Stanford
professors.
"Dead Week was a familiar sight
around the University for many years.
When Dead Week came for a visit,
everyone knew it meant a short break
to regroup one's resources before fi
nals.
"Over the last few years, gangs of
roving professors brutally mauled
Dead Week with barbaric regularity,
assigning papers and holding classes
with impunity. In its old age, Dead
Week became so battered that even the
students could not distinguish it from
any other week of the quarter.
"Dead Week is survived by its three
distant cousins, Christmas Vacation,
Spring Break and Summer Vacation.
"Funeral services will be held to
morrow in Memorial Church at 2 p.m."
People everywhere folded their

papers in disbelief. "Why him?" they
asked. "He was so young, so full of joy
and life." No one could believe that the
Week they knew so well was gone for
good.
The next morning, Stanford groaned
under damp, leaden skies.
Memorial Church filled early that
day. Even alumni from faraway flew in
to pay their last respects to the one they
loved so well.
Muffled sobs and somber organ
chords droned through the church as
the minister strode to the pulpit.
"This is a sad day indeed for all of
us," he intoned. "Dead Week was a
good friend to all; a noble seven days
that will always live in our hearts.
"Let us not remember 'Deady' as he
is now," said the minister, "but re
member those happy times so long
ago. A time when professors would
never schedule tests or papers or prob
lem sets. A time when most professors
did not even hold classes. Students

were able to stop their hurried bustle,
cogitate on their newly-acquired erud
ition and prepare themselves for the
upcoming onslaught of Finals Week."
The minister strutted back, clasping
his hands in a prayerful fashion.
"But dark, insidious, pedagogical
powers at Stanford, jealous of IDead
Week's popularity with the students,
wrought the poor Week's doom. At
first, Dead Week stood the abuse, a
class here, a paper there. But soon their
vicious attacks became too much for

poor 'Deadv' to bear. Although he is
dead now, he is not forgotten. He has
risen to a higher realm, to a life far
better than what this lowly speck of
dust can. . .
Suddenly, the doors flung open and
an unruly mob of professors clamored
into the church.
"Come on, we've got work to assign
you!" bellowed one of the pedantic
ruffians.
"Dead Week is dead," snarled
another to the quivering congregation.
"There is nothing you can do now."
The tenured thugs bullied their way
through the mass of petrified pupils,
shoveling out problem sets and paper
topics.
One little girl with blonde curls and
blue eyes, twirled around with inno
cent indignation and shushed the
mob. Everyone fell silent. She shook
her little finger at the gaping brutes
and said, "Don't you have any respect
for the Dead?"

first, Dead Week stood the abuse, a
class here, a paper there. But soon their
vicious attacks became too much for

poor 'Deadv' to bear. Although he is
dead now, he is not forgotten. He has
risen to a higher realm, to a life far
better than what this lowly speck of
dust can. . .
Suddenly, the doors flung open and
an unruly mob of professors clamored
into the church.
"Come on, we've got work to assign
you!" bellowed one of the pedantic
ruffians.
"Dead Week is dead," snarled
another to the quivering congregation.
"There is nothing you can do now."
The tenured thugs bullied their way
through the mass of petrified pupils,
shoveling out problem sets and paper
topics.
One little girl with blonde curls and
blue eyes, twirled around with inno
cent indignation and shushed the
mob. Everyone fell silent. She shook
her little finger at the gaping brutes
and said, "Don't you have any respect
for the Dead?"

All over campus, people read the
shocking obituary. "Dead Week, 71,
died today from injuries sustained
from multiple assaults by Stanford
professors.
"Dead Week was a familiar sight
around the University for many years.
When Dead Week came for a visit,
everyone knew it meant a short break
to regroup one's resources before fi
nals.
"Over the last few years, gangs of
roving professors brutally mauled
Dead Week with barbaric regularity,
assigning papers and holding classes
with impunity. In its old age, Dead
Week became so battered that even the
students could not distinguish it from
any other week of the quarter.
"Dead Week is survived by its three
distant cousins, Christmas Vacation,
Spring Break and Summer Vacation.
"Funeral services will be held to
morrow in Memorial Church at 2 p.m."
People everywhere folded their

papers in disbelief. "Why him?" they
asked. "He was so young, so full of joy
and life." No one could believe that the
Week they knew so well was gone for
good.
The next morning, Stanford groaned
under damp, leaden skies.
Memorial Church filled early that
day. Even alumni from faraway flew in
to pay their last respects to the one they
loved so well.
Muffled sobs and somber organ
chords droned through the church as
the minister strode to the pulpit.
"This is a sad day indeed for all of
us," he intoned. "Dead Week was a
good friend to all; a noble seven days
that will always live in our hearts.
"Let us not remember 'Deady' as he
is now," said the minister, "but re
member those happy times so long
ago. A time when professors would
never schedule tests or papers or prob
lem sets. A time when most professors
did not even hold classes. Students

were able to stop their hurried bustle,
cogitate on their newly-acquired erud
ition and prepare themselves for the
upcoming onslaught of Finals Week."
The minister strutted back, clasping
his hands in a prayerful fashion.
"But dark, insidious, pedagogical
powers at Stanford, jealous of IDead
Week's popularity with the students,
wrought the poor Week's doom. At
first, Dead Week stood the abuse, a
class here, a paper there. But soon their
vicious attacks became too much for
