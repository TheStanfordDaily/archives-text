After a careful reading of Dan Livingston's column on the
Bakke decision (Daily, Feb. 17), we are convinced that he is
one of the more naive opponents of affirmative action. Re
verse discrimination is perhaps the most imaginative fabri
cation in racial relations since the "yellow peril."
Livingston's discussion leads one to believe that vast
numbers of white males are being turned away from profes
sional schools and careers, and that in this process irrepara
ble harm is done to them. Such an analysis overstates both
the "harm" done to white males and the effect that affirma
tive action programs have had on improving opportunities
for members of minority groups and women.
Takes time
Livingston is correct that affirmative action has not
worked — not because it has resulted in "reverse discrimi
nation," but because its goals have not been attained. He
suggests that the repeal of discriminatory statutes has re
sulted in the elimination of discrimination. Such is not the
case.
The assumption that affirmative action could have (in a
period of fewer than 10 years) reversed patterns which
have been extant throughout our history as a republic is
absurd. A careful examination of academic appointments
and faculty composition at Stanford will sustain this con
tention.
We do not believe that the elimination of prejudice can be
legislated. We do believe that equal protection is a neces
sary function of law. To deny Bakke access to UC-Davis on
the basis of race is reprehensible. To deny the impact that

living in a racist and sexist society has on the achievement
scores of women and members of minority groups, and
subsequently using those scores as the sole criterion for
admission, is equally reprehensible. We agree with Har
vard's President Bok that other factors are important.
'Ploy'
Livingston's appeal to "education, open-mindednessand
a genuine respect for our fellow man" (ouremphasis) as the
means to the elimination of social discrimination, rather
than to active modification of the social system itself is
really the typical ploy of those who wish to maintain the
status quo; i.e., white males as usual in all positions of
authority, prestige and power, as well as in control of the
access to those positions.
We are skeptical of the utility of a strategy which advo
cates passive acceptance of systemic injustice while await
ing the magical day of "attitude change" especially when
the relationship between attitudes and actions has never
been adequately demonstrated. The system will only
change if we in fact, change it.
Finally, to suggest that the end of affirmative action is a
step in the direction of fulfilling Dr. King's or any other
thinking American's dream is ridiculous. It is much more
likely to lead, as Gamson suggests, to violence. This country
was in turmoil in the '60s when only a fraction of oppressed
blacks took to the streets. If they are joined by women . . .

Livingston is correct that affirmative action has not
worked — not because it has resulted in "reverse discrimi
nation," but because its goals have not been attained. He
suggests that the repeal of discriminatory statutes has re
sulted in the elimination of discrimination. Such is not the
case.
The assumption that affirmative action could have (in a
period of fewer than 10 years) reversed patterns which
have been extant throughout our history as a republic is
absurd. A careful examination of academic appointments
and faculty composition at Stanford will sustain this con
tention.
We do not believe that the elimination of prejudice can be
legislated. We do believe that equal protection is a neces
sary function of law. To deny Bakke access to UC-Davis on
the basis of race is reprehensible. To deny the impact that

living in a racist and sexist society has on the achievement
scores of women and members of minority groups, and
subsequently using those scores as the sole criterion for
admission, is equally reprehensible. We agree with Har
vard's President Bok that other factors are important.
'Ploy'
Livingston's appeal to "education, open-mindednessand
a genuine respect for our fellow man" (ouremphasis) as the
means to the elimination of social discrimination, rather
than to active modification of the social system itself is
really the typical ploy of those who wish to maintain the
status quo; i.e., white males as usual in all positions of
authority, prestige and power, as well as in control of the
access to those positions.
We are skeptical of the utility of a strategy which advo
cates passive acceptance of systemic injustice while await
ing the magical day of "attitude change" especially when
the relationship between attitudes and actions has never
been adequately demonstrated. The system will only
change if we in fact, change it.
Finally, to suggest that the end of affirmative action is a
step in the direction of fulfilling Dr. King's or any other
thinking American's dream is ridiculous. It is much more
likely to lead, as Gamson suggests, to violence. This country
was in turmoil in the '60s when only a fraction of oppressed
blacks took to the streets. If they are joined by women . . .

After a careful reading of Dan Livingston's column on the
Bakke decision (Daily, Feb. 17), we are convinced that he is
one of the more naive opponents of affirmative action. Re
verse discrimination is perhaps the most imaginative fabri
cation in racial relations since the "yellow peril."
Livingston's discussion leads one to believe that vast
numbers of white males are being turned away from profes
sional schools and careers, and that in this process irrepara
ble harm is done to them. Such an analysis overstates both
the "harm" done to white males and the effect that affirma
tive action programs have had on improving opportunities
for members of minority groups and women.
