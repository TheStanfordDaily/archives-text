It was very disappointing to read the
many distortions and unfounded alle
gations contained in the article "U.S.
backs Taiwan oppression" (Daily, Jan.
13).
First, we would like to point out that
people who try to infiltrate, to do vio
lence or to cause disruptions in an or
derly society deserve to be brought to
justice.
Chen, a previously convicted com
munist intelligence agent, again "dis
tinguished" himself as a tool of the
communists. During his trial it was
proved beyond reasonable doubt that
orders for his acts of treason against
the people and government of Repub
lic of China (Taiwan) were directly
traceable to the Communist Chinese
Embassy in Japan.
In short, Chen was proven to be no
more than a pawn with which the Red
Chinese sought to "conquer" Taiwan.
Using his trial as an example of gov
ernment oppression is ludicrous.
Having been born, raised, and edu
cated in Taiwan, Republic of China,
we firmly believe that the majority of
persons there support the present gov
ernment and do not feel oppressed.

Foldy's claim that "KMT's white terror
to overseas Chinese students here" is
also a complete fabrication and we
consider it an insult to us.
We do not know of any Chinese stu
dent from Taiwan here who has been
threatened by any agency of the Re
public of China. All of us, no matter
what our attitude toward our govern
ment may be, can travel freely in and
out of Taiwan.
Traditionally, Taiwanese students
at Stanford have maintained a very
close relationship among themselves.
All of them enjoy the freedom of
speech and everybody may talk freely
in open conversation without fear of
reprisals by the Chinese government.
We feel sorry that the author was
inadequately informed. He doesn't
provide the facts and merely reports
the stories commonly bandied about
by uniformed radicals and irresponsi
ble persons. He should be encouraged
to get to know the Republic of China
better.

Shtern's plight
In your article on the requested re
lease of Soviet endocrinologist
Mikhail Shtern (Daily, Feb. 22) you
neglected to mention the most impor
tant aspect of that situation, namely,
the real reason for Shtern's incarcera
tion.
It is true, as you stated, that Shtern
was convicted of trumped — up brib
ery charges, but what you failed to
point out was that the motive behind
that conviction was to punish him be
cause he and his sons had applied for
visas to emigrate to Israel.
Thus, Shtern's plight is not unlike
that of thousands of other Soviet Jews
who have lost jobs, personal posses
sions and ultimately all their civil
rights because they or members of
their families have indicated a desire
to emigrate to Israel.
Efforts by Drs. Federman, Romberg,
eta/, to gain Shtern's release are to be
commended, but we would do well to
remember that Shtern is distinguished
by his reputation as a scientist, not by
the uniqueness of his tragic plight.

Handball courts
As a concerned handbal l/racquetbal 1
player I would like to raise my voice in
protest against the probable elimina
tion of the IM handball tournament by
Dr. Wesley Ruff, chairman of the phys
ical education department. The tour
nament pairings posted inEncinaGym
show that so many of the handball
doubles teams originally in the tour
nament have dropped out that a total of
only 16 matches will be played.
There are 288 racquetball time slots
available per week (three courts H«*e
96 45-minute periods) and 96 handball
slots. If we assume that half the tour
nament matches are played on the
John A. Blume Handball Court, not an
unreasonable assumption from my ex
perience, then the expected decrease
in racquetball court availability over
the quarter would be minimal.
I think that more effective ways of
easing the court crunch can be found
and would like to express my interest
in the student-faculty committee that
will form policy for the deGuerre
courts.

Shtern's plight
In your article on the requested re
lease of Soviet endocrinologist
Mikhail Shtern (Daily, Feb. 22) you
neglected to mention the most impor
tant aspect of that situation, namely,
the real reason for Shtern's incarcera
tion.
It is true, as you stated, that Shtern
was convicted of trumped — up brib
ery charges, but what you failed to
point out was that the motive behind
that conviction was to punish him be
cause he and his sons had applied for
visas to emigrate to Israel.
Thus, Shtern's plight is not unlike
that of thousands of other Soviet Jews
who have lost jobs, personal posses
sions and ultimately all their civil
rights because they or members of
their families have indicated a desire
to emigrate to Israel.
Efforts by Drs. Federman, Romberg,
eta/, to gain Shtern's release are to be
commended, but we would do well to
remember that Shtern is distinguished
by his reputation as a scientist, not by
the uniqueness of his tragic plight.

Handball courts
As a concerned handbal l/racquetbal 1
player I would like to raise my voice in
protest against the probable elimina
tion of the IM handball tournament by
Dr. Wesley Ruff, chairman of the phys
ical education department. The tour
nament pairings posted inEncinaGym
show that so many of the handball
doubles teams originally in the tour
nament have dropped out that a total of
only 16 matches will be played.
There are 288 racquetball time slots
available per week (three courts H«*e
96 45-minute periods) and 96 handball
slots. If we assume that half the tour
nament matches are played on the
John A. Blume Handball Court, not an
unreasonable assumption from my ex
perience, then the expected decrease
in racquetball court availability over
the quarter would be minimal.
I think that more effective ways of
easing the court crunch can be found
and would like to express my interest
in the student-faculty committee that
will form policy for the deGuerre
courts.

It was very disappointing to read the
many distortions and unfounded alle
gations contained in the article "U.S.
backs Taiwan oppression" (Daily, Jan.
13).
First, we would like to point out that
people who try to infiltrate, to do vio
lence or to cause disruptions in an or
derly society deserve to be brought to
justice.
Chen, a previously convicted com
munist intelligence agent, again "dis
tinguished" himself as a tool of the
communists. During his trial it was
proved beyond reasonable doubt that
orders for his acts of treason against
the people and government of Repub
lic of China (Taiwan) were directly
traceable to the Communist Chinese
Embassy in Japan.
In short, Chen was proven to be no
more than a pawn with which the Red
Chinese sought to "conquer" Taiwan.
Using his trial as an example of gov
ernment oppression is ludicrous.
Having been born, raised, and edu
cated in Taiwan, Republic of China,
we firmly believe that the majority of
persons there support the present gov
ernment and do not feel oppressed.

Foldy's claim that "KMT's white terror
to overseas Chinese students here" is
also a complete fabrication and we
consider it an insult to us.
We do not know of any Chinese stu
dent from Taiwan here who has been
threatened by any agency of the Re
public of China. All of us, no matter
what our attitude toward our govern
ment may be, can travel freely in and
out of Taiwan.
Traditionally, Taiwanese students
at Stanford have maintained a very
close relationship among themselves.
All of them enjoy the freedom of
speech and everybody may talk freely
in open conversation without fear of
reprisals by the Chinese government.
We feel sorry that the author was
inadequately informed. He doesn't
provide the facts and merely reports
the stories commonly bandied about
by uniformed radicals and irresponsi
ble persons. He should be encouraged
to get to know the Republic of China
better.
