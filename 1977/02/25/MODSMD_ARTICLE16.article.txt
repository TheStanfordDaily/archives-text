# The Dolly lure—travel, fame and dance?
## 
### 
(Second of three parts)
"Lots o/ people think that it's
all parties and glamour. Some
times you'rn fining to be up on a
pedestal and other times you're
the scum of the earth. You've got
to be able to roll vvitli the
punches when you're a Dolly.
You have to say. yes. I am a little
self-centered and. yes, I do like
to dance - and then go for it."
—Terry Bowman
former Dolly
About 30 "a little self
centered" women arranged
themselves in neat rows like we
used to do in junior high P.E. It
looked a little like they were get
ting ready for a game of "Streets
and Alleys."
And some of them made good
streets. Lots of curves. A couple
had pretty ample rest spots.
Dolly practices were begin
ning in earnest.
At first. I was a little ap
prehensive about going to these
workshops. I thought they might
be kind of catty. There was a cer
tain element ot competition
there, but after a while they be
came more like a social affair.
"Oh, 1 know at the practices
that everyone is sizing up
everyone else," Laura Mead, a
freshman, told me. "But I don't
want to talk about those women,

whether they're cute or not.
"I don't go there all dressed up
to practice. I'm not there to im
press anyone. But I'm not going
to underestimate them because
when they do try to impress
people I'll bet they're all attrac
tive."
Helping others
For the most part, the women
helped each other at the prac
tices. If one of them loused up
"Come Join the Band," they
could usually find someone who
would help them out with a
badly-needed step.
And the Dollies were there,
walking between the rows, al
ways giving somebody advice.
"A little vaseline right here
helps," one said. Humor has it
that last year some of the Dolly
candidates actually chewed
Ex-Lax before the try outs to help
flatten the tummy.
The Hand wants nothing to do
with fat Dollies.
But some of the women, appa
rently, want something to do
with the Band.
"1 think I really want a chance
to meet the people in the Band,"
one woman told me. "I think that
would be a lot of fun." A lot of
women expressed the same sen
timents, which should please
the Band.

In fact, quite a few women
seemed to be trying out because
they wanted to expand their so
cial life. Being a Dolly would be,
they thought, "a lot of fun."
Fun? Maybe. But before this
year's Big Game the Dollies were
putting in upwards of 40 hours a
week of practice time. Plus they
were carrying full class loads.
Bowman was probably right
when she said that you have to
be a little ego-centric in order to
try out for the Dollies. A lot of
women said that they wanted to
be Dollies because, sure, they en
joyed dancing and wouldn't
mind doing it in front of the stu
dent body.
Others thought it would be
kind of neat to travel. 1 find that
most attractive. Stanford plays
its first two football games in
Colorado and New Orleans next
year. There is something about
the Band on Bourbon Street that
is really exciting.
And I've got a number of
cousins who 1 haven't seen in a
while in different parts of the
United States. It would be a nice
vehicle for a family reunion.
If you're a Dolly, you do
things.
Drawbacks
But there are drawbacks
which Mead pointed out to me.

"1 like to dance but I really had to
sit down and decide whether or
not I wanted to throw away a
whole year's worth of
academics," she said. "And be
sides, you give up a lot. I doubt
that if you were a Dolly and
wanted to run for the Council of
Presidents you could because of
that damn stereotype."
Oh, I don't know. I remember
at least one Dolly, Stephanie
Jubina, who was senior class
president two years ago.
But the fact is that none of the
women trying out have any great
ulterior motive — unless it is ex
panding their social life. •
They liked to dance, they said.
They thought it would be neat to
travel. Some of them looked like
they might have a little of the
golddigger in them, but that, not
unexpectedly, went unsaid.
And maybe those are the best
reasons for trying out for the Dol
lies.
But like Heidi Jacobson said,
"I am not used to being called a
Dolly yet. and in two weeks I am
going to be called an old Dolly."
And Carl a Murray added, "You
don't know what being a Dolly is
like until after its over."
(The third part of this series,
consisting of interviews with the
Dollies, will run Monday.)

Dancing
Heidi Jacobson (left) and Carrie Teagle dance to the Band early this year. "I am not used to being
called a Dolly yet, and in two weeks I'll be called an old Dolly,'' Jacobson said.
