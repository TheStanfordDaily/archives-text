Please help us to get some decent food machines
at LOTS (the new computer at SCRDT). At least
Pine Hall had tepid microwave burritos!

I know, 1 know, stale M&Ms can get pretty tiring.
At present there are no food machines at LOTS —
except, of course, your basic candy, coke and cig
gie vendors.
But, if you're more into porking out on mic
rowave burritos than candy bars, help is on tin
way. Although she's not making any promises,
Chris Barnette, who supervises the vending ser
vices, says they are checking the situation out.
Barnette says, "We never say 'no' before we follow
through on a request."
Before they can say "yes," says Barnette, they'll
have to figure out t he number of people who would
use the machine, the hours the building is open,
the a mount of space avail able, and whether there is
an electrical outlet nearby.
Barnette says it's "hard to say when" they will
make a final decision. In the meantime, if you get
the machine food munchies in the middle of the
night, you may have to go a long way. Besides Pine

Hall, the only other food machines are in the Medi
cal Center.

First of all, for those of you who've never
noticed, the lights on the second floor have a yel
lowish tint while the lights on both the third and
fourth floors are a harsher greener white. Techni
cally, the first type is called "warm white" and the
latter, "cool white."
The difference isn't because one type saves more
energy. Unfortunately, says Jewell Goode from
plant services, UGLY is one of the few buildings on
campus with odd-sized light fixtures. Energy
saving lights come in only four-foot and eight-foot
lengths, and only three-foot lights can fit in Meyer.
Goode says they usually install the same type of
light throughout a building — all warm or all cold
So, he speculates that someone must have asked
specifically for the warmer type of lighting on the
second floor.
