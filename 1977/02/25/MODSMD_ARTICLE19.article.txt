# Enology Club uncorks a popular beverage

### 
The advent of wine as a symbol of Car
teresque austerity may or may not be an
impetus to wine's growing popularity at
Stanford. President Carter has recently
banished all liquor from the White House
except beer and wine.
Alec White, a marketing consultant for
Cemello's winery and co-founder of the
Stanford Enology Club, points out that
"more people are drinking white wine as
an aperitif at cocktail parties than mar
tinis ... In fact, the burgeoning popular
ity of wine is reflected in the shortage of
good white wine."
The Enology Club sponsors three popu
lar wine classes taught here each quarter.
For the winter term, it is also holding five
tasting sessions on a trial basis. White
describes the reaction to the tastings as
"amazing: it seems that anything to do
with wines on campus is purely a matter
of publicity by the club for its activities."
Each night, the tasting group samples
eight disguised wines made from a single
grape variety. Then it ranks the wines on a

scale of one to 20 points, with the best
wine receiving the lowest score.
The first tasting on Wednesday, Feb. 9,
featured eight Chardonnays, six of which
are from California. The others are white
Burgundy classics. The 1974 David Bruce
Chardonnay ($10) rated the best. Second
was the 1974 Hanzell ($8.50) followed by
the '74 Beringer Bicentennial ($5). The
French Chardonnays placed an inau
spicious 60th and eighth.
The Dry Sauvignon Blanc tasting on
Wednesday, F'eb. 16 at the Deke house
resulted in the 1972 Van Loben Sels ($5)
top-ranked. The 1975 Joseph Phelps
($4.75) placed second and a French san
ceire ($4.39) third. Finishing fourth was
the 1975 Robert Mondavi ($5.25).
Sauvignon Blanc generally is light in
color, often with a green tinge, and has a
high acidity and steely flavor. It often
smells like bell pepper, or thief grape is
picked late, it can have a spicy bouquet. It
is well-suited to vegetarians and sea food
afficionados.

The final tasting sessions are on March
2 and March 9 at 7:30 and will include
German Reislings ($3.75 per person) and
California Zinfandels ($3.50 per person).
Anyone who calls the Enology Club at
365-1414 may attend. Reservations must
be made two days in advance. "
White says that tasting groups are gen
erally made up of two types of people.
The first his the professional group
(lawyers and doctors) who, through their
socioeconomic position, seem to take a
more aesthetic attitude toward wine and
can afford the higher-priced bottles.
The first group views wine "more as a
staple than as a luxury."
Stanford students are the majority at
the tastings, says White, and fall into the
second category. "Tastings give students
on a limited economy the opportunity to
sample a large variety of wines. The cost
is defrayed and you can taste an $8 Bor
daux, a wine you wouldn't have bought
otherwise."
Blind tastings also put people in em
barassing situations, says White, because

"blind tastings force you into objectivity.
A Grand Cou from Bordeaux often tastes
better when you know what it is." Furth
ermore it is valuable to find out that you
prefer a $3 California to a $20 French im
port. You find out not only what the con
sensus likes, but what you like as well.
"An expert or a writer for a newsletter
can't tell you which wines are good, be
cause your tastes differ." Adds White,
"What is more subjective than your pa
late?"
Wines that win the tastings are those
which display the best balance of flavors
and body, but especially pcid and tannin.
"Wine makers aim at a symphony rather
than a cacophony of these four qualities."
But even White concedes that, in the final
analysis, it is whatever "tastes good."
People at Stanford are learning that
wine is quite a beverage as a staple rather
than a drink for only special occasions.
Furthermore, tastings are "social occa
sions where you can meet people and
have fun."

Sauvignon Blanc generally is light in
color, often with a green tinge, and has a
high acidity and steely flavor. It often
smells like bell pepper, or thief grape is
picked late, it can have a spicy bouquet. It
is well-suited to vegetarians and sea food
afficionados.

White says that tasting groups are gen
erally made up of two types of people.
The first his the professional group
(lawyers and doctors) who, through their
socioeconomic position, seem to take a
more aesthetic attitude toward wine and
can afford the higher-priced bottles.
The first group views wine "more as a
staple than as a luxury."
Stanford students are the majority at
the tastings, says White, and fall into the
second category. "Tastings give students
on a limited economy the opportunity to
sample a large variety of wines. The cost
is defrayed and you can taste an $8 Bor
daux, a wine you wouldn't have bought
otherwise."
Blind tastings also put people in em
barassing situations, says White, because

"blind tastings force you into objectivity.
A Grand Cou from Bordeaux often tastes
better when you know what it is." Furth
ermore it is valuable to find out that you
prefer a $3 California to a $20 French im
port. You find out not only what the con
sensus likes, but what you like as well.
"An expert or a writer for a newsletter
can't tell you which wines are good, be
cause your tastes differ." Adds White,
"What is more subjective than your pa
late?"
Wines that win the tastings are those
which display the best balance of flavors
and body, but especially pcid and tannin.
"Wine makers aim at a symphony rather
than a cacophony of these four qualities."
But even White concedes that, in the final
analysis, it is whatever "tastes good."
People at Stanford are learning that
wine is quite a beverage as a staple rather
than a drink for only special occasions.
Furthermore, tastings are "social occa
sions where you can meet people and
have fun."
The advent of wine as a symbol of Car
teresque austerity may or may not be an
impetus to wine's growing popularity at
Stanford. President Carter has recently
banished all liquor from the White House
except beer and wine.
Alec White, a marketing consultant for
Cemello's winery and co-founder of the
Stanford Enology Club, points out that
"more people are drinking white wine as
an aperitif at cocktail parties than mar
tinis ... In fact, the burgeoning popular
ity of wine is reflected in the shortage of
good white wine."
The Enology Club sponsors three popu
lar wine classes taught here each quarter.
For the winter term, it is also holding five
tasting sessions on a trial basis. White
describes the reaction to the tastings as
"amazing: it seems that anything to do
with wines on campus is purely a matter
of publicity by the club for its activities."
Each night, the tasting group samples
eight disguised wines made from a single
grape variety. Then it ranks the wines on a

scale of one to 20 points, with the best
wine receiving the lowest score.
The first tasting on Wednesday, Feb. 9,
featured eight Chardonnays, six of which
are from California. The others are white
Burgundy classics. The 1974 David Bruce
Chardonnay ($10) rated the best. Second
was the 1974 Hanzell ($8.50) followed by
the '74 Beringer Bicentennial ($5). The
French Chardonnays placed an inau
spicious 60th and eighth.
The Dry Sauvignon Blanc tasting on
Wednesday, F'eb. 16 at the Deke house
resulted in the 1972 Van Loben Sels ($5)
top-ranked. The 1975 Joseph Phelps
($4.75) placed second and a French san
