### Laura Kennedy 
"It's offensive to me not to base ad
missions on race, because we have
been considered second class citi
zens," said Jim Bell, head of Hastings
Black Law Students Association.
Speaking at a teach-in on the Bakke
decision Wednesday night. Bell and
three other speakers the
California Supreme Court's decision
that a special minority admissions
program at the UC-Davis Medical
School discriminated against a white
applicant, Alan Bakke.
The other speakers at the teach-in
were Arturo Barrera of the Stanford
Chicano Law Students Association; Ron
Takaki, head of the UC-Berkeley
Ethnic Studies Department; and Man
uel Hernandez of Stanford MEChA.
Hernandez substituted for originally
scheduled Lee Brightman, head of Un
ited Native Americans, Inc.
After a brief history of the Bakke de
cision given by moderator Richard
Katsuda, a member of the Stanford Co
alition Against the Bakke Decision,
Bell examined some of the legal argu
ments of the case for the audience of
about 50 persons.
Decision next year
Bell predicted that the U.S. Supreme
Court, which accepted the case for re
view Tuesday, would issue a decision
by October of next year.
The state supreme court was wrong
in assuming that Bakke was better
qualified than minority applicants
who had been accepted, Bell said. The
court's assumption, Bell noted, was

based on test scores and grades, which
he said are culturally biased.
Bell also said it was legal for UC-
Davis to reserve 16 spaces in its 100-
person class for minorities if the pur
pose was to redress past discrimina
tion.
However, UC-Davis could not come
up with any past discrimination, said
Bell. Bell dismissed as "absurd" alter
natives to minority preference prog
rams proposed by UC-Davis. The
proposals included constructing more
medical schools, recruiting more
minorities and encouraging whites to
serve in minority neighborhoods.
'Sham defense'
Barrera said the issue of past dis
crimination was not brought up in the
case by UC-Davis, but in briefs submit
ted by "friends of the court." Because
no evidence is allowed to be presented
in these "amicus" briefs, said Barrera,
the court should have pressed for evi
dence of past discrimination.
Barrera also criticized the court's
logic in invalidating a minority prefer
ence program, but permitting UC-
Davis to give admission preference to
applicants from medically understaf
fed areas of Northern California who
planned to return to their com
munities.
Takaki questioned the purpose of af
firmative action programs as presently
constituted, saying, "1 think affirma
tive action can be something positive if
we use it as a means of promoting so
cial change."
Hernandez said affirmative action

programs were needed because
minorities are still not able to over
come the discrimination built into
American society.
Bob Britton, a shop steward for Un
ited Stanford Employees, spoke from
the audience about the many grie
vances he has handled concerning vio
lations of Stanford's affirmative action
commitment in hiring.
"Stanford University is more than
willing to see affirmative action go out
the door because it's a thorn in their
side," Britton charged.
The teach-in was sponsored by the
Office of Campus Activities and the
Stanford Coalition Against the Bakke
Decision.
