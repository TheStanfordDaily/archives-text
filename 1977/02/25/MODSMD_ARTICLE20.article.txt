# Women had it worse back in the good days

Lipsticks: "The farmette's
favorite color this fall is 'scarlet
slipper,' a brilliant reddish pink
with 'stop red' running a close
second. On those ever so impor
tant dates she wears 'siren,' 'ras
cal red,' 'madcap,"indiscreet,'
'heart throb' or 'dark secret.' "
Looking back has been a re
cent popular theme for books,
films and theatre. Nostalgic
sighs are not always of the
those-were-the-days variety,
however.
Women's libbers: if you think
you've got it bad now, you
would have real ly had a difficult
time of it in the 4()s. Look, for
example at Stanford's 1940-41
"Regulations for Women Stu
dents" booklet. "It is expected
that Stanford women will act at
all times in accordance with the
standards of 'good taste and
good citizenship.' " This intro
duction sounds harmless, at
first, that is, until the "good
taste" criteria are spelled out.
"Experience has demonstrated,"
it says in the booklet, "that it is
not considered acceptable for a
woman student to enter a man's
hall, fraternity, or apartment on
or off campus save in the com
pany of at least one other wo

man. Stanford women shall not
enter places of public resort
where their presence will bring
discredit upon themselves or the
University."
Women were not only prohi
bited from running around in
"questionable" places, they
were largely prohibited from
running around, period. Wo
men's dorms closed at 10:30 on
week nights and 12 weekends.
(There was a special 12:30 ex
tension on Registration dance
evenings.) According to the
pamphlet, "The entertainment
of men after the closing hours of
women's residences shall be
termed a lock-in and treated as a
lock-out of equal duration."
Along with changes in Stan
ford women's lifestyles came
dramatic fashion alterations. If
you've watched television or
been to the movies, though, you
already know about that. More
surprising, is the amount of time
Stanford women devoted to con
templating fashion trends. Sea
sonal fashion editions were a
popular Daily item with ad slo
gans like "Call for me at Six,"
"After the Game," "Stadium
Stunners" and "Glitter at Night"
filling the pages.
An excerpt from a November
Daily posits the reason for the
40s woman's "vital interest in
fashion trends." "She wants to
be as attractive as possible, for
the 'two-to-one' ratio, her insur
ance of social success, has gone
with the draft."
Daily fasnion pages covered
anything and everything weara
ble â€” bobby socks, saddles, lip
stick, pajamas and more. "If you
want to be different," said one
article, "with ideas that set you
apart from the crowd, try a few of
these suggestions, so small, yet

so effective. In your hair thrust
luminous combs, devastating
whether you're blonde or
brunette. . ,
This front page story is even
harder to believe: "the biggest
news about Eastern skirts is that
they're short. No, we don't mean
19 or 20 in., we mean way up
above the knee! College girls at
such supposedly dignified in
stitutions as Smith and Vassar
parade calmly around campus
with their knees in view. . ,
(shocking!).
And Stanford men were not
about to be left out of all this
fashion flurry. They had much to
say about how their women
dressed. "Rough (40s slang for a
Stanford male) Disapproves of
Wedgies" read one headline.
The story concluded that, "wo
men, as Confucius would say,
'who wan dates Big Game night
should show less heel and more
toe.' "
Another reason 40s women
may have adorned themselves
with such care is the greater
abundance of social events for
which they had to dress. Formal
affairs were much more the rage
then than now with women in a
constant whirl of teas, jolly-up's
(informal dances), Coke socials,
and Sadie Hawkins. Dances
were such big deals they often
made front page news.
Here's a typical example: "The
F'arm's annual Sadie Hawkins
Dance will rock the Pavilion to
morrow night. This affair is the
only campus dance to which
Stanford women can drag the
men. This is the third time that
Farm women have had the op
portunity to OFFICIALLY ask
men to go to a dance with them.
Wonder whether tomorrow's
SadieHawkins Dance will create
such a stir.
