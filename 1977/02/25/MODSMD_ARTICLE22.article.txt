### Dean Eyre 
Bechtel had an increase in the
number of foreign visitors of 812
percent over the 1974-1975
period of September through
August, according to an annual
report by Maria Bun, coordinator
for the Office of Foreign Visitors
at Bechtel International Center.
The figures showed a total of
910 visitors came here between
September 1975 and August
1976 from 95 different counties.
The most popular month was
April with 166 visitors, followed
by August, with 146.
Bun cited the combined attrac
tion of the election year and
Bicentennial as a major reason
for the increase in foreign vis
itors. She said that many
politically-oriented visitors
"wanted to observe the conven
tions, caucuses, and primaries."
The Bicentenial motivated
"special interest groups." For
example, Bun cited a group of
"70 professors of history and
geography from France" who
had a "marvelous opportunity."
"In general the Bicentennial had
so much to offer for foreigners."
When categorized by country
of origin, the figures showed that

321, or 35.3 per cent of the travel
lers came from Great Britain, and
Western and Central Europe.
East Asia and the Faific Area
ranked second wih 225 or 24.7
per cent.
The most popular profession
or primary interest of those com
ing to this area was the field of
education, with 545 or 59.9 per
cent of the visitors. Second was
government and public affairs,
concerning 149 or 16.4 of the ar
rivals.
A total of 385, or 42.3 per cent
visited under the auspices of
U.S. Government departments
or agencies. Over 12 percent, 111
visitors, were visiting in connec
tion with foundations and vol
untary organizations.
The Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace re
ceived the largest number of vis
itors, 112, while 83 participated
with Administration and Ser
vices programs. Off-campus par
ticipation was predominantly
associated with local research,

business and industrial organi
zations, attracting 10 foreign vis
itors.
Included among the arrivals
were 15 university presidents
from other nations and His Ex
cellency, Joseph R.L. Kot
sokoane, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs of Lesotho, considered the
"best informed, liveliest and
most brillant speaker," accord
ing to the annual report.
Nobel Peace Prize nominee,
Don Melder Camara, Ar
chbishop of Recife, Brazil was
described as "the most distin
guished international visitor,"
drawing a capacity audience at
Bechtel for his lecture covering
liberation, theology, peace, Am
nesty International, and World
Food movements.
The Community Committee
for International Students head
by Florence McAllister and as
sisted by Gloria Eddie organized
the volunteers who assisted in
making the visitors' stays run
smoothly.
