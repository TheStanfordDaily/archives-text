Foundation, Rockefeller has de
voted himself to solving prob
lems in many fields, particularly
population, thearts, and cultural
exchange with Asia.

named Rockefeller chairman of
the National Commission on
Population and the American
Future which prepared a com
prehensive study on population
in this country. He was also a
member of the Advisory Board of
the United Nations Fund for
Population Activities.
The founding of the Asian
Society exemplifies Rockefel
ler's efforts to expand the under
standing between the United
States and nations in the Far
East. The Society's publications,
education programs, and exhibi
tions aim at increasing Ameri
can knowledge of Asia both past
and present, Rockefeller was
also president of the Japan Soci
ety in New York from 1952 to
1970.
Rockefeller has been an in
novative patron of the arts. He

headed the committee which
developed the idea for a center
for dance, music, and theater in
New York. For 13 years he
served as president or chairman
of Lincoln Center for the Per

the committee's study.
His influence appears in other
areas of art. The )DR 3rd Fund
established by Rockefeller in
1963, supports visual and per
forming arts exchange programs
between the United States and
Asian countries. The Fund also
developed a program which
makes art courses an integral
part of American elementary and
secondary school education.
