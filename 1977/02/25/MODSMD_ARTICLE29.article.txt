# Illegal alien entry increase reported

Calexico, Calif. (AP) — Illegal
aliens are entering the United
States from Mexico in record
numbers, and border patrol of
ficers say they are losing the bat
tle to control the flow.
"It's a very serious situation,"
says Henry Felchlin, chief of the
El Centro border patrol station
which covers California's Impe
rial Valley and San Bernardino
County.
"We've already caught more
than 2250 this month compared
to 1582 in February of last year,"
he said.
The border patrol uses
helicopters and electronic sur
veillance to stop illegal aliens.
But for every person caught, two
and sometimes three are known
to get through undetected.
A total of 870,000 illegal
aliens were apprehended across
the nation last year, compared to
790,000 the year before. Nine out
of 10 were Mexicans.
Patrol chiefs along the 1966-
mile border from San Ysidro,
Calif., to Brownsville, Tex., ex
pect the number to increase by at
least a third this year because of
population growth and the
economic crisis in Mexico.
The Mexican government de
valued the peso by about half last
year making dollar wages dou
bly attractive to Mexicans.
A Mexican who earns the
equivalent of $4 a day in his own
country can make $16 to $20 in
he United States if he can cross
the border and avoid the law en
forcement officers.
Unemployment in Mexico
runs more than one-third of the

labor force. The cuntry also has
such a high growth rate that its
population is expected to quad
ruple in 40 years to 240 million
— the present population of the
United States.
The majority of Mexican il
legal aliens cross with the help
of well-organized gangs of
smugglers who charge them be
tween $150 to $500 a head, de
pending on how deep inside the
United States the Mexians want
to go.
A great number of these are
robbed and victimized and most

of them work for less than the
legal minimum wage — a fact
that has brought frequent com
plaints from U.S. labor unions
over the years.
One border patrol chief who
did not want to be quoted by
name said, "Some people want
to throw the U.S. borders wide
open and let anyone who wants
to come in. Others want them
completely closed, like building
a wall all around. 1 don't think
that will work either. You'll
need a whole army along the

border and that also won't do
much good."
I
Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell says the
Carter administration will sup
port legislation making it illegal
for employers to hire illegal
aliens. The United States is one
of the few countries in the world
that has no such law.
Chamber of Commerce people
along the border claim Mexican
labor —legal or not— is vital to
the economies of southern
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona
and California.
