# 'Why do you think that way?'
## Signs point to new spring class 
### Sara Lessley 
Why do you think that way? Why are
your classes so boring? Why is Stan
ford so expensive? Why do you think
you're so different?
The campus has been inundated
with "why" posters like these re
cently. Who's behind them?
Ten graduate students are responsi
ble for the profusion of advertise
ments. The signs are part of their pub
licity campaign for a class they will
lead next quarter called, "Why do you
think that way? Work, sex, change."
"The course will be unlike any other
course in the way it's taught and what
is taught," said Michael Levenson, one
member of the graduate student teach
ing collective.
The graduate students want to cover
such diverse topics as "careerism, sex
roles, health care, violence, sexual vio
lence, education and the media." he
said. The collective would also like to
discuss "old habits of thought and new
sensibilities." said Levenson.
John Powers, another member of the
teaching collective, would "rather
look generally at knowledge." The
class will try to analyze "basic as
sumptions about why a student takes
certain classes and what these classes
may lead to," he added.
Carol Sternhell, a graduate student,
said the class was "an alternative." a
class that isn't "boring or traditional."
It will be taught along those lines, with
group lectures, student workshops,
presentations and films.
The publicity campaign—hundreds
of posters plastered around campus—
is part of the non-traditional approach.
"This course isn't listed in the course
catalog for bureaucratic reasons," said

Levenson. "We aren't particularly in
terested in the catalog anyway," he
added.
The course is listed in the SWOPSI
course bulletin for spring quarter,
however.
The course i§ sponsored by Assoc.
English Prof. Diane Middlebrook. The
class will be listed as English 163 A,
but will not be English-oriented, said
members of the collective. The three to

five unit class will be part film, part
psychology, part literature and part
politics, said Sternhell. The collective
has put no limit on the number of stu
dents who may enroll in the class.
Offered Monday, Wednesday and
Friday, 163 A will have one to two pre
sentations each week which every
body attends. The remaining time will
be divided into more specialized
workshops based on student interest.

course in the way it's taught and what
is taught," said Michael Levenson, one
member of the graduate student teach
ing collective.
The graduate students want to cover
such diverse topics as "careerism, sex
roles, health care, violence, sexual vio
lence, education and the media." he
said. The collective would also like to
discuss "old habits of thought and new
sensibilities." said Levenson.
John Powers, another member of the
teaching collective, would "rather
look generally at knowledge." The
class will try to analyze "basic as
sumptions about why a student takes
certain classes and what these classes
may lead to," he added.
Carol Sternhell, a graduate student,
said the class was "an alternative." a
class that isn't "boring or traditional."
It will be taught along those lines, with
group lectures, student workshops,
presentations and films.
The publicity campaign—hundreds
of posters plastered around campus—
is part of the non-traditional approach.
"This course isn't listed in the course
catalog for bureaucratic reasons," said

Levenson. "We aren't particularly in
terested in the catalog anyway," he
added.
The course is listed in the SWOPSI
course bulletin for spring quarter,
however.
The course i§ sponsored by Assoc.
English Prof. Diane Middlebrook. The
class will be listed as English 163 A,
but will not be English-oriented, said
members of the collective. The three to

five unit class will be part film, part
psychology, part literature and part
politics, said Sternhell. The collective
has put no limit on the number of stu
dents who may enroll in the class.
Offered Monday, Wednesday and
Friday, 163 A will have one to two pre
sentations each week which every
body attends. The remaining time will
be divided into more specialized
workshops based on student interest.
