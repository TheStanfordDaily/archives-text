# Quake predictions save lives, but may jolt local economies

Denver (AP) — Successful earthquake forecasts
will save lives, but they will also create "severe
economic depression and social disruption" in
areas that are told they are in danger of destruction,
a new study warned yesterday.
The two-year study, supported by the National
Science Foundation, was conducted by a team of
social and physical scientists at the Institute for
Behavioral Science of the University of Colorado.
The study's findings were reported to the annual
meeting of the American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science.
"The first successful prediction of a damaging
earthquake in the United States could come within
a few years, or it could take a decade or more, since
scientifically based earthquake prediction is still
largely in the research stage in this country," said
J. Eugene Haas, director of the study with Dennis
Mileti of Colorado State University.
The scientists said that accurate earthquake pre
dictions would save many lives, but will cause

"significant social disruption and decline in the
local economy," especially if the earthquake is
predicted a year or more in advance.
Some of the potential effects the study listed:
—A decline in property values and tax revenues.
—Changes in investment patterns and availabil
ity of mortgages and insurance.
—Temporary or permanent relocation by people
living in the area.
—A decline in business activity and employ
ment opportunities.
Among the specific questions raised by the
study:
—Should evacuation from high-risk areas be en
couraged? Urged? Ordered?
—Should disclosure of earthquake risk be re
quired in all real estate transactions?
—Should local news media "play down" news
that is likely to have a negative impact on their
communities?
