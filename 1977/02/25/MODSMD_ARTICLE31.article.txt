## YUCCH! UCLA whitewashes Cards 114-83 
### 
By Chris Baker

Los Angeles — For those of you who saw
last week's 69-52 debacle to Washington
State, you ain't seen nothing yet.
The Cardinals played their worst game of
the season last night, losing a 114-83 contest
to fifth-ranked UCLA.
Of course you can look on the bright side,
it wasn't as bad as UCLA's 120-74 drubbing
of Stanford last year.
UCLA was coming off a 64-52 loss to Ore
gon and some people were calling for coach
Gene Bartow's scalp, but last night the
Pauley Pavilion crowd of 12,000 exerted the
Bruins "to pour it on."
And that's just what UCLA did.
Do it to us
All-American forward Marquess Johnson
had his best game of the season, scoring 30
points and pulling down 14 rebounds.
The 6-foot-7 senior hit 10 of 16 shots from
the floor and 10 of 14 from the line. He had 21
points in the first half on seven of 12 shots
from the field and seven of eight from the
line.
"We just went out and played ball to
night," said Johnson. "I think we're hope
fully on the right track after the loss to Ore
gon. We have the momentum and there's no
reason why we can't sustain it.
"We definitely had our backs against the
wall after the loss to Oregon. We went out
and practiced with a busi ness-like attitude."
Let out pressure
Some of the pressure was removed when
the Bruins learned that Washington State
had knocked Oregon out of a first-place tie
with the Bruins with a 55-53 victory over the
Ducks last night in Pullman.
"1 am pleased with George Raveling to
night," Bartow said. "I'm happy for George,
but WSU smells a playoff berth. They're 18-6
aren't they?
"It's one game at a time for sure. 1 thought
we played great defense tonight. Our zone

press kept us running and 1 was pleased to
see us play with such intensity."
What's a press?
The Cards played like they'd never even
heard of a press last night.
Stanford tied the game at 7-7 with 16:10
left in the first half, but the Cards couldn't
seem to be able to get the ball down court.
Stanford had 11 turnovers in the first half, as
UCLA took a 30-19 at the halfway mark of the
period.
UCLA also killed Stanford on the boards.
The Bruins outrebounded the Cardinals
22-14 in the first half, as they took a 55-38
lead into the dressing room at the intermis
sion.
What's defense?
"We played very poor defense tonight and
we had too many turnovers in the first half,"
said Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso. "UCLA
scored on about 90 per cent of their posses
sions in the first half. In the first half we
didn't stop them from scoring. It seemed
they just scored about every time down."
UCLA wasn't as dominating in the second
half though. But then the Bruins didn't have
to be, with a 20-point lead to play around
with.
"They're very talented. They out
rebounded us all night, particularly on the
offensive boards. A lot of credit has to go to
Gene Bartow. Our mistakes were caused by
their defense," said Dißiaso.
"They knew what we were doing and they
did a good job stopping it."
What's a point?
UCLA's front line dominated the smaller
Cardinals. Sophomore forward David
Greenwood pumped in 26 points and grab
bed eight rebounds to compliment Johnson.
The Bruin guards, maligned all season,
came through last night. Roy Hamilton and
Jim Spillane scored 12 points each and
Hamilton had a game-high eight assists.
The Cards got 16 points each from Kim
berly Belton and Mike Bratz, but Bratz was

held to just four points in the first half by
Spillane. The ever-improving Tom Schmal
zried had 15 points.
Howling success
Wolfe Perry earned the respect of the
Pauley crowd for his spectacular lay-ins.
Perry also finished with 17 points.
But the numbers last night belonged to
UCLA. The Bruins scored the most points
they had all season. They also tied their
one-game field goal record at 46.
Perhaps the most important stat besides
the score was the fact that UCLA out
rebounded Stanford by 20 — 49-29.

Stanford tied the game at 7-7 with 16:10
left in the first half, but the Cards couldn't
seem to be able to get the ball down court.
Stanford had 11 turnovers in the first half, as
UCLA took a 30-19 at the halfway mark of the
period.
UCLA also killed Stanford on the boards.
The Bruins outrebounded the Cardinals
22-14 in the first half, as they took a 55-38
lead into the dressing room at the intermis
sion.
What's defense?
"We played very poor defense tonight and
we had too many turnovers in the first half,"
said Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso. "UCLA
scored on about 90 per cent of their posses
sions in the first half. In the first half we
didn't stop them from scoring. It seemed
they just scored about every time down."
UCLA wasn't as dominating in the second
half though. But then the Bruins didn't have
to be, with a 20-point lead to play around
with.
"They're very talented. They out
rebounded us all night, particularly on the
offensive boards. A lot of credit has to go to
Gene Bartow. Our mistakes were caused by
their defense," said Dißiaso.
"They knew what we were doing and they
did a good job stopping it."
What's a point?
UCLA's front line dominated the smaller
Cardinals. Sophomore forward David
Greenwood pumped in 26 points and grab
bed eight rebounds to compliment Johnson.
The Bruin guards, maligned all season,
came through last night. Roy Hamilton and
Jim Spillane scored 12 points each and
Hamilton had a game-high eight assists.
The Cards got 16 points each from Kim
berly Belton and Mike Bratz, but Bratz was

held to just four points in the first half by
Spillane. The ever-improving Tom Schmal
zried had 15 points.
Howling success
Wolfe Perry earned the respect of the
Pauley crowd for his spectacular lay-ins.
Perry also finished with 17 points.
But the numbers last night belonged to
UCLA. The Bruins scored the most points
they had all season. They also tied their
one-game field goal record at 46.
Perhaps the most important stat besides
the score was the fact that UCLA out
rebounded Stanford by 20 — 49-29.

Los Angeles — For those of you who saw
last week's 69-52 debacle to Washington
State, you ain't seen nothing yet.
The Cardinals played their worst game of
the season last night, losing a 114-83 contest
to fifth-ranked UCLA.
Of course you can look on the bright side,
it wasn't as bad as UCLA's 120-74 drubbing
of Stanford last year.
UCLA was coming off a 64-52 loss to Ore
gon and some people were calling for coach
Gene Bartow's scalp, but last night the
Pauley Pavilion crowd of 12,000 exerted the
Bruins "to pour it on."
And that's just what UCLA did.
Do it to us
All-American forward Marquess Johnson
had his best game of the season, scoring 30
points and pulling down 14 rebounds.
The 6-foot-7 senior hit 10 of 16 shots from
the floor and 10 of 14 from the line. He had 21
points in the first half on seven of 12 shots
from the field and seven of eight from the
line.
"We just went out and played ball to
night," said Johnson. "I think we're hope
fully on the right track after the loss to Ore
gon. We have the momentum and there's no
reason why we can't sustain it.
"We definitely had our backs against the
wall after the loss to Oregon. We went out
and practiced with a busi ness-like attitude."
Let out pressure
Some of the pressure was removed when
the Bruins learned that Washington State
had knocked Oregon out of a first-place tie
with the Bruins with a 55-53 victory over the
Ducks last night in Pullman.
"1 am pleased with George Raveling to
night," Bartow said. "I'm happy for George,
but WSU smells a playoff berth. They're 18-6
aren't they?
"It's one game at a time for sure. 1 thought
we played great defense tonight. Our zone

press kept us running and 1 was pleased to
see us play with such intensity."

Howling success

Los Angeles — For those of you who saw
last week's 69-52 debacle to Washington
State, you ain't seen nothing yet.
The Cardinals played their worst game of
the season last night, losing a 114-83 contest
to fifth-ranked UCLA.
Of course you can look on the bright side,
it wasn't as bad as UCLA's 120-74 drubbing
of Stanford last year.
UCLA was coming off a 64-52 loss to Ore
gon and some people were calling for coach
Gene Bartow's scalp, but last night the
Pauley Pavilion crowd of 12,000 exerted the
Bruins "to pour it on."
And that's just what UCLA did.
Do it to us
All-American forward Marquess Johnson
had his best game of the season, scoring 30
points and pulling down 14 rebounds.
The 6-foot-7 senior hit 10 of 16 shots from
the floor and 10 of 14 from the line. He had 21
points in the first half on seven of 12 shots
from the field and seven of eight from the
line.
"We just went out and played ball to
night," said Johnson. "I think we're hope
fully on the right track after the loss to Ore
gon. We have the momentum and there's no
reason why we can't sustain it.
"We definitely had our backs against the
wall after the loss to Oregon. We went out
and practiced with a busi ness-like attitude."
Let out pressure
Some of the pressure was removed when
the Bruins learned that Washington State
had knocked Oregon out of a first-place tie
with the Bruins with a 55-53 victory over the
Ducks last night in Pullman.
"1 am pleased with George Raveling to
night," Bartow said. "I'm happy for George,
but WSU smells a playoff berth. They're 18-6
aren't they?
"It's one game at a time for sure. 1 thought
we played great defense tonight. Our zone

press kept us running and 1 was pleased to
see us play with such intensity."
What's a press?
The Cards played like they'd never even
heard of a press last night.
Stanford tied the game at 7-7 with 16:10
left in the first half, but the Cards couldn't
seem to be able to get the ball down court.
Stanford had 11 turnovers in the first half, as
UCLA took a 30-19 at the halfway mark of the
period.
UCLA also killed Stanford on the boards.
The Bruins outrebounded the Cardinals
22-14 in the first half, as they took a 55-38
lead into the dressing room at the intermis
sion.
What's defense?
"We played very poor defense tonight and
we had too many turnovers in the first half,"
said Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso. "UCLA
scored on about 90 per cent of their posses
sions in the first half. In the first half we
didn't stop them from scoring. It seemed
they just scored about every time down."
UCLA wasn't as dominating in the second
half though. But then the Bruins didn't have
to be, with a 20-point lead to play around
with.
"They're very talented. They out
rebounded us all night, particularly on the
offensive boards. A lot of credit has to go to
Gene Bartow. Our mistakes were caused by
their defense," said Dißiaso.
"They knew what we were doing and they
did a good job stopping it."
What's a point?
UCLA's front line dominated the smaller
Cardinals. Sophomore forward David
Greenwood pumped in 26 points and grab
bed eight rebounds to compliment Johnson.
The Bruin guards, maligned all season,
came through last night. Roy Hamilton and
Jim Spillane scored 12 points each and
Hamilton had a game-high eight assists.
The Cards got 16 points each from Kim
berly Belton and Mike Bratz, but Bratz was

held to just four points in the first half by
Spillane. The ever-improving Tom Schmal
zried had 15 points.
Howling success
Wolfe Perry earned the respect of the
Pauley crowd for his spectacular lay-ins.
Perry also finished with 17 points.
But the numbers last night belonged to
UCLA. The Bruins scored the most points
they had all season. They also tied their
one-game field goal record at 46.
Perhaps the most important stat besides
the score was the fact that UCLA out
rebounded Stanford by 20 — 49-29.
