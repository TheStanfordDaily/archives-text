## 18 teams in Stanford Invitational 
### Julie Fiedler 
Cardinal women swimmers will make their February debut today in hosting a field of 18
teams for the Stanford Invitational Championships. Due to meet cancellations by UC-Davis
and UC-Berkeley earlier this season, the Stanford team has not competed in almost a month.
Amont the schools competing in the two-day affair wili be 1976 AIAW Champions Arizona
State, runner-up UCLA and tough competitor USC. The meet begins this afternoon at 2 p.m.
and tomorrow at 9 a.m. following the AIAW Championship meet format. One-and three-meter
diving will be included in the competition
"This meet should be a preview of the nationals," said Stanford assistant coach Debbie
Meyer. "From our standpoint, we're ready for the meet, as we haven't competed for a month
We've been able to have some good workouts over the past few weeks, but the girls need the
competition."
Four Olympians will swim in the Invitational this weekend. Stanford, third in the AIAW last
year and ranked second this season, features gold medalist Kim Peyton and Australian Judy
Hudson. ASU also boasts two Olympic swimmers in Melissa Belote and Canada's Leslie Cliff

- both strong in the backstroke and IM events.
Teams competing in addition to ASU, UCLA, USC and Stanford will be Arizona, San Jose
State, California, UC-Davis, Long Beach State, UC-San Diego, Fresno State, UOP, UC-Santa
Barbara, Pomona College, San Diego State, San Francisco State, Colorado, and the College
of Sequoias.
Comprising what is probably the strongest women's swimming team in Stanford history are
Peyton, Rose Storm and Barb Bacon in the sprints, middle and distance freestylers Jo
Harshbarger, Margot Hagstette, Anne Brodell and Valehe Lee, and Judy Hudson in the IM and
breaststroke events
Most of the Cardinal team members have already met qualifying standards for the AIAW
Championships to be held March 17-19 at Brown University.
Other top swimmers who will be on hand for the Invitational include butterfliers Peggy
Tosdaland Maura Campion (Arizona) and UCLA's Jean Haney; ASU's Amy Bettencourtin the
breaststroke: and Kathy Kedley of UCLA in the IM and freestyle events.
