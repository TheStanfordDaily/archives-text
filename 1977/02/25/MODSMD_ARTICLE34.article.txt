# Making waves
## You gotta believe 
### Jill Lieber 
Champions have great self-confidence. They
set goals and believe they can reach them.
Through sacrifices, commitment, dedication
and discipline, they perform to their potential
more than an athlete who doesn't truly havea
positive attitude going into competition.
"In sports, as in everything else, the one im
portant factor is belief in yourself," said track
coach Payton Jordan. "It's not how much you
know or how hard you work, although it would
be wrong to minimize these attributes. For a
successful outcome, one must believe in his
goals and dreams."
"The past couple of years," Olympic gold
medalist breaststroker John Hencken said, "dur
ing the season my times have been slow. But I
kept telling myself that my training had worked
for me in the end every other year and that when
it counted, 1 was rested, tapered and swam well
at the Nationals.
"There are positive and negative attitudes in
people. Those with negative attitudes don't go
anywhere, but those who think positively havea
greater potential."
Better performances come out of athletic
competition when mental talents are employed.
Positive mental talents. An athlete must enter
the contest knowing that he has properly
trained, having done everything possible to per
form to his utmost.
"Thert is constant self talking within champ
ions," Jordan said. "Champions don't put off
realization of goals. They think in the now and
say 'I am going to move forward right now. I am
going to make it.'
"Any athlete has to view himself the way he
wants to be. He has to ask himself, 'Am I proud?
Am I reasonably happy? Am I doing everything 1
can to reach my goals?'
"In athletic competition, as in nothing else,
the athlete is put on the line for a very, very short
moment. In a race he shows his total self—
mentally, physically and organically. And, as he
awaits the starting gun he thinks, 'Oh, God, am I
prepared?'
"Successful athletes answer with a strong
yes."
Jordan believes every person is born with a
great deal more potential than he ever uses. In
any area of life, it is a person's mental attitude
that determines the use of real potential ability.
"Usually one's thoughts are based upon past
experiences which tend to refortify the attitude
about one's abilities," he said. "Ability can be
dramatically improved by changing the attitude
one has about the ability and thus the subcon
scious habit pattern which controls the ability."
Any incoming Stanford student — athlete or
not — realizes the need to look ahead during the
first year here. At Stanford we are thrown in
among 12,000 other "upper crusters." It's a
shock. We are no longer the number one math

student. We are no longer the best backstroker in
the area. We can no longer count on winning the
mile in the conference championships.
And it's right then and there — when we are
no longer in a comfort zone — that we must
decide whether we will continue to perform as
we have in the past only to be average, or to work
our butts off and try and get to the top.
In athletics as in academics, those who think
they can, can. Quoting a passage from a poem
that sticks in my mind from Joe Roth's funeral
Tuesday, "Life's battles are not won by the
stronger or faster or better man/ Sooner or later
they are won by the man who thinks he can."
"The guy who goes into Pac-8 swimming
competition thinking he's not good enough to
win — that he'll never finish first — has a de
featist attitude," Hencken said. The Pac-8 boasts
three teams — UCLA, USC and Cal — which will
without question finish in the top ten nationally
and most likely within the upper six.
"Self doubting gives everyone an avenue ol
escape," Jordan said. "Through coaching we
have to help an athlete move his standards up.
We must work him harder in practice so he be
comes comfortable in a competitive situation.
"Teammates take a strong part in helping an
athlete (who has a defeatist attitude). If they hear
negative talk like 'I can never beat so-and-so,'
they've got to talk around it with positive words.
They've got to say, 'Heck, you're not far from
him. You're coming along.'"
Winning doesn't always mean finishing first.
To an athlete whose performance is measured by
times, it means bettering a previous mark. To an
athlete who is a member of a team, it means
executing plays properly — being in the right
place at the right time. To the athlete who jogs or
swims for fitness, it means going just a little bit
further each day.
"You win a battle within yourself as you
realize greater goals," Jordan said. "You've
overcome fear. People who have faith in them
selves are more apt to be winners."
Courage is developed with each competitive
test.
"No matter what it is, there is always some
body around to tell you what you aim to do
cannot be done," Jordan once wrote in a letter to
his team. "It maybe a friend. It may bean enemy.
They will stop you on only one condition, that
you allow them to plant a little seed of doubt in
your mind. What they say cannot stop you. What
you think can.
"If you are truly in earnest about becoming a
champion, you must get a skin thick enough to
make their doubts bounce off you, and behind
that skin the guts to discipline yourself and carry
on.
"Students or shot putter, merchant or miler,
retailer or relay man, you've got to have guts to
be a champion."
