Stanford's volleyball team
faces cross-bay rival California
tonight when the two top North
ern California teams meet at 7:30
in Maples Pavilion. The Cards
are defending Nor Cal champ
ions and defeated the Bears in
last year's play-off tournament

on their way to the crown.
"This should be a close, excit
ing match," predicted head
coach Art Lambert. "Cal is a very
big, tall team. They have been
improving every game out."
Lambert noted improvement
on the Stanford squad as well.

"We're really starting to come
together as a team. Since this is
our first full year of varsity com
petition we've had to make a
changeover. It takes a lot more
time and effort to play on a full
varsity level, but the guys are
coming around and we're start
ing to become a strong, unified
team."
The Card squad has been con
centrating on defensive play
over the past few weeks.
"We still need to work harder
on blocking, but the general
amount of hustle is greater,"
Lambert said.
Track
