# Gould predicts Card netters to be definite national contenders
## 
### Jill Lieber 
"This is the best competitive
team that I've ever coached,"
said Dick Gould, now in his
eleventh year of coaching at
Stanford. "We definitely have a
shot at the national title. And I
mean definitely."
Pre-season collegiate tennis
buffs thought the Cards would
not stand a chance nationally
with a six-man ladder made up
of one junior, two sophomores
and three freshmen. But let's
look at who makes up that six
man ladder.
The top two players on the
1977 team are sophomore Matt
Mitchell and junior Bill "Willie"
Maze. Don't let the order of men
tion fool you—Gould has not yet
designated his number one man
and probably won't until just be
fore the Cards travel to Los
Angeles to take on top ranked
USC and the UCLA Bruins the
first weekend in April.
"Bill Maze is as good as any
player in collegiate tennis,"
Gould said.
Maze arrived back on campus
this week to compete in the
Nor-Cal Intercollegiates after a
successful jaunt to England
where he won every match in
which he played—singles and
doubles —in the British Pet
roleum Cup Tournament.
"For a big guy," Gould went
on, "he moves beautifully.
Sometimes he tends to be sloppy
and careless in matches and
practice, but when he is ready
mentally he really plays great."
Maze, an All-American in '76,
played the number one and two
singles for Stanford last season
and compiled a 8-6 record.
"He's one of the few players in
college tennis who can hurt you
with every shot he's got," the
coach went on. "Right now he's
making a transition between
playing super aggressively and
too loose. Once he tightens up
and finds a happy medium he'll
be tough to beat."
Maze takes on Brad Rowe of
San Jose State today at the Var
sity Courts in the semifinals of
the Nor-Cals at 1 p.m. in what

promises to be a tough match
up.
Soph Matt Mitchell withdrew
from the tournament today be
cause of stomach flu. Gould was
pleased by Mitchell's first place
finish at the National Amateur
Indoor Championships in Salis
bury, Md. last weekend. The
Palo Alto native captured the
singles crown and combined
forces with junior Perry Wright
for the top doubles spot.
"Matt is showing a tremend
ous amount of maturity," said
Gould. "He's using more variety
in his game and using the lob
better. He's got a lot more self
composure on the court this year
and has a strong positive at
titude."
Gould then praised Wright for
the seemingly endless im
provement of his game.
"Perry is a super tough com
petitor and a great team player.
He's best known for his excellent
doubles game but he will be hard
to beat at the number three posi
tion this year. His serve has im
proved and he is volleying with
more authority."
Wright is the only other Card
to advance to the semis of singles
competition today in the Nor-
Cals.
In doubles, the Cards' three
teams all see action today. Fans
will finally get to see Gould's
new freshmen sensations when
Peter Rennert and Lloyd Bourne
take the court against Cal's Car
los Aguilar and Steve Hahn. The
Card duo claimed the Palm
Springs Collegiate Doubles title
in January. Also competing will
be the team of Maze and John
Rast and Wright and Bill
Hodges.
The semifinal singles begin at
1 p.m. and quarterfinal doubles
begin at 1 and 2 with semis fol
lowing at 4.
Saturday the final round be
gins at 1 p.m.
