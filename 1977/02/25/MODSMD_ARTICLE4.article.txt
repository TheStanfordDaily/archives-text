Job placements for new Stanford graduates increased 11
per cent last year, according to Ralph Keller, director of the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
Out of 1911 students seeking job placement last year, said
Keller, only 204 reported they were "still available for
employment" at year's end. a drop of 15 per cent from the
previous year.
Keller said the job situation also improved among alumni
registrants at the center. Among 1336 alumni using the job
placement service last year, he said, only 86 reported them
selves still without work at the end of the year, an improve
ment of 12 per cent over 1975.
The improvement in job placement was especially
noticeable among science and engineering graduates. Kel
ler noted that placements for engineering majors increased
15 per cent over 1975, compared to a nationwide average
increase of only three percent.
"Comparatively, Stanford's graduates fared remarkably
well," Keller said.
Placement for liberal arts majors did not improve very
much, with jobs for graduating seniors increasing by only
one per cent over 1975 levels, said Keller.

Tom James, director of engineering and science job
placement at the center, explained that corporations are
chiefly looking for engineering or science majors to fill
positions.
"Companies don't come across the United States to re
cruit liberal arts majors," James said, "whereas a company
might very well come to Stanford to hire, say, a mechanical
engineer."
Keller added that Stanford students seeking college and
university teaching positions were "quite successful", with
placements up 39 per cent over last year. Among those
seeking elementary and secondary school teaching posi
tions, said Keller, only eight students did not have a job by
the end of 1975. *
Overall, college graduates face "quite severe" job pros
pects nationally over the next few years, Keller warned. He
urged undergraduates to develop as diverse an educational
background as possible.
"Too often, students presume they are acquiring a solid
general education when as a matter of fact they are
specializing in their preparation," Keller said. "This ten
dency is most dangerous when it is directed towards an area
of interest which in no way relates to career possibilities."
