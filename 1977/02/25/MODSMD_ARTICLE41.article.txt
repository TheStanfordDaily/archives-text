Carter administration cuts foreign aid
Washington — The Carter administration has decided to
cut foreign military aid to Argentina, Uruguay and Ethiopia
because the nations have violated the human rights of their
citizens, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance disclosed yester
day.
"We have made some cuts already," Vance said at a
hearing of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
foreign operations. No figures on the cuts were given.
This marked the first time the new administration has put
its overseas human rights policy into tangible terms. Previ
ous expressions took the form of verbal protests.
But Vance said there would not be automatic reductions
in aid because of human rights problems in foreign coun
tries.
Although the United States has deep concern about the
human rights situation in South Korea, he said, it neverthe
less will stand by its security commitments to that country.
Vance appeared before the subcommittee to support the
Carter administration's proposed $7.27 billion foreign aid
budget. The Carter request is up $947 million from the
proposal of the' Ford administration in January.
Conservatives form 'shadow cabinet'
Washington — Leaders of the conservative movement,
edging away from the traditional Republican party base,
announced a "shadow cabinet" yesterday to keep an eye on
President Jimmy Carter and his policies.
The counterpart secretary of state said ht' plans to travel
to Panama to express concern about the Panama Canal talks.
The conservative "shadow cabinet" includes a counter
part to each member of Carter's official Cabinet.
The group's organizers say the shadow cabinet idea was
based on the British system where the opposition party
organizes such a cabinet with counterparts of each of the
individual official cabinet members. The opposition
cabinet members speak out on the government's policies
and prepare alternatives.
New Hampshire Gov. Meldrim Thomson, a Republican
who will be the shadow secretary of state, said he intended
to lead a delegation to J'anama which is seeking greater
control over the Panama Canal. U.S. and Panamanian dip

lomats are now negotiating the canal's future.

The conservative "shadow cabinet" includes a counter
part to each member of Carter's official Cabinet.
The group's organizers say the shadow cabinet idea was
based on the British system where the opposition party
organizes such a cabinet with counterparts of each of the
individual official cabinet members. The opposition
cabinet members speak out on the government's policies
and prepare alternatives.
New Hampshire Gov. Meldrim Thomson, a Republican
who will be the shadow secretary of state, said he intended
to lead a delegation to J'anama which is seeking greater
control over the Panama Canal. U.S. and Panamanian dip

lomats are now negotiating the canal's future.
