Blackout
Power in Wilbur, Stern, Crothers Memorial and much of
the Cowell Cluster was out yesterday, due to transformer
problems caused when water leaked into electric ductwork
serving those dorms.
According to Robert Mcknight, manager of utilities,
power was to be completely restored by midnight yester
day.
Movie change
Lovejoy's Nuclear War, a movie sponsored by Against the
Grain, will be shown at 8:15 p.m. only, tomorrow night.
Yesterday's "Spectrograph" carried incorrect information.
Chicken dinners
Tomorrow night, when you get that Big Mac attack, you
don't have to look for a ride to McDonald's. Just get on your
bike and pedal over at 8 p.m. to IJjamaa Lounge in Lagunita
Court.
You will find a delectable dinner prepared by "Big
Daddy" to satisfy all your epicurean delights. For a mere $2
donation you can sink your teeth into succulent fried chic
ken, mouth-watering green beans, palatable potato salad
and luscious dessert fit for royalty.
Proceeds will help send a student to college.
