# Senate confirms Turner for top intelligence post
## 
### 
Washington(AP)—The Senate today
confirmed President Jimmy Carter's
choice of Adm. Stansfield Turner to
head the Central Intelligence Agency.
The nomination was approved with
out dissent.
Turner won Senate approval with
ease. Carter sent his nomination to
Capitol Hill on Feb. 7, not long after his
first choice for the post, former White
House aide Theodore Sorensen, had
asked that his name be withdrawn.

The only question raised about
Turner, who was a Naval Academy
classmate of Carter's, was whether he
should be allowed to retain his Navy
commission while serving as CIA di
rector.
The 53-year-old naval officer takes
control of the CIA at a time when it
once again is in the news as a result of
alleged covert activities.
The latest controversy involving the
agency revolves around published re

ports the CIA paid millions of dollars
over a 20-year-period to King Hussein
of Jordan and may have made similar
secret payments to other foreign lead
ers.
Carter told a news conference on
Wednesday that an examination of
CIA covert activities had disclosed no
thing the president considered illegal
or improper.
Convicted Watergate burglar and
former CIA agent E. Howard Hunt said
giving money to foreign governments,
like the reported grants to Jordan's
King Hussein, is "an honored tradition
within the CIA."
He said at a news conference yester
day that he made substantial cash
payments to government officials in
Japan, Mexico and Uruguay while
working as a CIA station chief.
"The payments to foreign govern
ments or to specific sections of their
national police or clandestine service
is a long and honored tradition within
the CIA," Hunt said. "There is cer
tainly nothing illegal about this."
Hunt did not say how much money
was involved, where it came from or
who received it.
Hunt, 58, made the comments at his
first news conference since leaving the
federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base,
P'la., Wednesday.
The session was held at the subur
ban Boston office of his booking agent,
who will oversee a series of lecture
tours Hunt has planned.
Hunt served 32 months in prison
after pleading guilty to conspiracy,
burglary and illegal wiretapping in the
1972 break-in at Democratic national
headquarters in the Washington, D.C.,
Watergate complex.
"When I was chief of station abroad
in many areas, it was common for me
to pay substantial figures to govern
ment persons of the local host gov
ernment," Hunt said. "1 certainly sup
ported Uruguayan intelligence, the
Mexican intelligence service—they
have six or seven different ones —and
the Japanese at one period."

The nomination was approved with
out dissent.
Turner won Senate approval with
ease. Carter sent his nomination to
Capitol Hill on Feb. 7, not long after his
first choice for the post, former White
House aide Theodore Sorensen, had
asked that his name be withdrawn.

The only question raised about
Turner, who was a Naval Academy
classmate of Carter's, was whether he
should be allowed to retain his Navy
commission while serving as CIA di
rector.
The 53-year-old naval officer takes
control of the CIA at a time when it
once again is in the news as a result of
alleged covert activities.
The latest controversy involving the
agency revolves around published re

ports the CIA paid millions of dollars
over a 20-year-period to King Hussein
of Jordan and may have made similar
secret payments to other foreign lead
ers.
Carter told a news conference on
Wednesday that an examination of
CIA covert activities had disclosed no
thing the president considered illegal
or improper.
Convicted Watergate burglar and
former CIA agent E. Howard Hunt said
giving money to foreign governments,
like the reported grants to Jordan's
King Hussein, is "an honored tradition
within the CIA."
He said at a news conference yester
day that he made substantial cash
payments to government officials in
Japan, Mexico and Uruguay while
working as a CIA station chief.
"The payments to foreign govern
ments or to specific sections of their
national police or clandestine service
is a long and honored tradition within
the CIA," Hunt said. "There is cer
tainly nothing illegal about this."
Hunt did not say how much money
was involved, where it came from or
who received it.
Hunt, 58, made the comments at his
first news conference since leaving the
federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base,
P'la., Wednesday.
The session was held at the subur
ban Boston office of his booking agent,
who will oversee a series of lecture
tours Hunt has planned.
Hunt served 32 months in prison
after pleading guilty to conspiracy,
burglary and illegal wiretapping in the
1972 break-in at Democratic national
headquarters in the Washington, D.C.,
Watergate complex.
"When I was chief of station abroad
in many areas, it was common for me
to pay substantial figures to govern
ment persons of the local host gov
ernment," Hunt said. "1 certainly sup
ported Uruguayan intelligence, the
Mexican intelligence service—they
have six or seven different ones —and
the Japanese at one period."
