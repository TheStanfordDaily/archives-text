# Two ask for senate vote on guest profs
## 
### Will Nixon 
Two ASSU senators have proposed
that the senate bylaws be changed to
allow the senate to appoint all mem
bers of the Guest Professorship Board
(GPB).
The proposal will also tighten re
porting procedures, according to Sen.
Dave Sharp, author of the proposal
along with Sen. Tim Ferguson. The
senate will vote on the proposal Mon
day night, Sharp said.
In a related development, GPB
chairman Carter Lake said yesterday
that the board and the Stanford Com
mittee to Free Sergei Kovalev will ask
for a joint fee assessment this spring.
Kovalev is an imprisoned Soviet
neurologist.
The senate presently appoints two
members to the GPB, with SCIRE,
SWOPSI and ARLO having one rep
resentative each.
The present board has four mem
bers: Lake and Steve Vettel, both ap
pointed by the senate; Mike Healy, a
freshman intern; and John Kanin, a
Representative from SCIRE. SWOPSI
representative John Reinke is in
Washington, D.C. There is no one from
ARLO.
Fee assessment
If Kovalev is released, "the great
majority of the fee assessment will go

to pay for a year-long appointment,"
said Lake. "If not, the money will go to
the board."
He said the board also has $3900 re
maining from last year, which next
year's board could use for a possible
course in the spring.
There will be no guest professor this
spring, according to Lake. But the
chances for a guest professor next fall
are excellent, he said.
During the past few weeks the GPB
has sent about 25 invitations, but no
replies have come in yet, he said.
The GPB has not used its $3900 this
year, because "We just didn't get it to
gether for the spring," said Lake. He
pointed out that the GPB had lost three
people in resignations at the begin
ning of the quarter.
Sen. Dan Livingston said he is "im
mensely unimpressed" with the GPB
this year. "The board's performance
this year is so bad that it has jeopar
dized the whole program," he said.
Livingston also criticized the lack of
communication between the senate
and the GPB. "I'm sure it will pass." he
said of the Sharp-Ferguson proposal.
Judging 'unfair'
"It's unfair to judge, considering
that last year's board had the $10,000
fee assessment and this year's board
didn't," said Kanin, who is also SCIRE
chairman. "If there's no fee assessment
money, then there's no reason to have
the board."
He said the GPB's main priority this
spring is getting a fee assessment ap
proved.
Last spring the board brought
Claude Steiner here to teach a course
on radical psychiatry and Angela
Davis to teach on a Marxist approach to
the female condition. A third guest,
Ernest Mandel of Belgium, was unable
to get a visa from the state department,
leaving the board with the $3900 it has
now.
Lack of time prevented theCPB from
seeking fee assessments last spring,
according to former GPB member Bill
Tyndall.

"Three people resigned at the end of
the winter quarter," he said. "That left
only two people to make the arrange
ments for the two courses. There sim
ply wasn't enough time to do a fee as
sessment."
"Lack of structure has caused all the
problems which have culminated in
this year's board," said Sen. Brad Kre
voy. "Information is not passed on
from year to year. No one knows what
the hell the responsibilities are."
TomGrahm, founder of the GPB four
years ago, said members of this year's
board "had to do a lot of learning."
Grahm said the GPB was originally
organized to bring an imprisoned
South Vietnamese student dissident
here. The GPB was set up with a loose
structure, he said, and was not neces
sarily meant to be a conti nui ng project.

ply wasn't enough time to do a fee as
sessment."
"Lack of structure has caused all the
problems which have culminated in
this year's board," said Sen. Brad Kre
voy. "Information is not passed on
from year to year. No one knows what
the hell the responsibilities are."
TomGrahm, founder of the GPB four
years ago, said members of this year's
board "had to do a lot of learning."
Grahm said the GPB was originally
organized to bring an imprisoned
South Vietnamese student dissident
here. The GPB was set up with a loose
structure, he said, and was not neces
sarily meant to be a conti nui ng project.
Two ASSU senators have proposed
that the senate bylaws be changed to
allow the senate to appoint all mem
bers of the Guest Professorship Board
(GPB).
The proposal will also tighten re
porting procedures, according to Sen.
Dave Sharp, author of the proposal
along with Sen. Tim Ferguson. The
senate will vote on the proposal Mon
day night, Sharp said.
In a related development, GPB
chairman Carter Lake said yesterday
that the board and the Stanford Com
mittee to Free Sergei Kovalev will ask
for a joint fee assessment this spring.
Kovalev is an imprisoned Soviet
neurologist.
The senate presently appoints two
members to the GPB, with SCIRE,
SWOPSI and ARLO having one rep
resentative each.
The present board has four mem
bers: Lake and Steve Vettel, both ap
pointed by the senate; Mike Healy, a
freshman intern; and John Kanin, a
Representative from SCIRE. SWOPSI
representative John Reinke is in
Washington, D.C. There is no one from
ARLO.
Fee assessment
If Kovalev is released, "the great
majority of the fee assessment will go

to pay for a year-long appointment,"
said Lake. "If not, the money will go to
the board."
He said the board also has $3900 re
maining from last year, which next
year's board could use for a possible
course in the spring.
There will be no guest professor this
spring, according to Lake. But the
chances for a guest professor next fall
are excellent, he said.
During the past few weeks the GPB
has sent about 25 invitations, but no
replies have come in yet, he said.
The GPB has not used its $3900 this
year, because "We just didn't get it to
gether for the spring," said Lake. He
pointed out that the GPB had lost three
people in resignations at the begin
ning of the quarter.
Sen. Dan Livingston said he is "im
mensely unimpressed" with the GPB
this year. "The board's performance
this year is so bad that it has jeopar
dized the whole program," he said.
Livingston also criticized the lack of
communication between the senate
and the GPB. "I'm sure it will pass." he
said of the Sharp-Ferguson proposal.
Judging 'unfair'
"It's unfair to judge, considering
that last year's board had the $10,000
fee assessment and this year's board
didn't," said Kanin, who is also SCIRE
chairman. "If there's no fee assessment
money, then there's no reason to have
the board."
He said the GPB's main priority this
spring is getting a fee assessment ap
proved.
Last spring the board brought
Claude Steiner here to teach a course
on radical psychiatry and Angela
Davis to teach on a Marxist approach to
the female condition. A third guest,
Ernest Mandel of Belgium, was unable
to get a visa from the state department,
leaving the board with the $3900 it has
now.
Lack of time prevented theCPB from
seeking fee assessments last spring,
according to former GPB member Bill
Tyndall.

"Three people resigned at the end of
the winter quarter," he said. "That left
only two people to make the arrange
ments for the two courses. There sim
ply wasn't enough time to do a fee as
sessment."
