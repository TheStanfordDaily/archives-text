# Sub-subcommittee recommendation
## Mandatory course reviews get first boost 
### Kathy Trafton News Analysis 
The recommendations in the ASSU
Task Force Report on Tenure and
Teaching Quality seem to have been
accepted by a sub-subcommittee of the
Faculty Senate. However, the sub
subcommittee said there may be some
problems with how the recommenda
tions are to be implemented.
The report's major recommendation
deals with instituting a mandatory
student evaluation of every cburse
each time it is offered.
The sub-subcommittee sent its con

elusions to the Subcommittee on the
Evaluation and Improvement of
Teaching Wednesday. The report is
scheduled to go to the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment (CAAA) next week and may
reach the Faculty Senate early next
quarter, according to Greg Larson,
chairperson of the sub-subcommittee.
Larson said that course evaluations
can serve three purposes: they can
provide feedback to the professor for
improving his teaching, they can pro
vide information to aid the decision
process of tenure committees and they
can help students choose classes.
Potential problems
The sub-subcommittee identified
six areas in the report that
should be discussed before the full
subcommittee:
1) The sub-subcommittee stressed
that the evaluation of teaching could
lead to improved teaching.
2) It said that an increased emphasis
on teaching should be desirable for its
own sake. A 50-50 parity in the weight
given to research and teaching in ap
pointments decisions is not necessar
ily desirable it said.
Larry Diamond, chairperson of the
task force that drafted the report, said
that he felt teaching and research

should be weighted equally by the te
nure committees.
3) The sub-subcommittee said that
some estimation of the monetary costs
of carrying out the report's proposals
should be made. The registrar is cur
rently working on this.
4) "Further definition of the prop
osed committee's responsibilities and
composition is necessary." The new
University committee would deal with
implementing the report's recommen
dations.
5) The format should focus on the
teaching quality aspect of the class, not
its entertainment potential.
6) The subcommittee reported that
"the proposal to make the evaluation
results public is one which might lead
to difficulty in gaining the acceptance
of the recommendations of the Task
Force."
Faculty Resistance
Diamond said he thought there will
be "some faculty resistance, I'm sure,
but there will be much less than in

preceeding years" over the proposed
mandatory course evaluations.
He said there may be some feeling
that only some courses should be
evaluated, but it would be a problem to
decide which ones. "You may as well
evaluate everything."
There have been very few reserva
tions about the report's recommenda
tion that retrospective surveys be con
ducted among seniors and recent
graduates. Diamond said.
The recommendation that search
committees make every effort to de
termine the teaching quality of tenure
candidates will be adopted "without
too much change," he said.
The proposal to grant $1000 perma
nent salary raises to professors for ex
cellent teaching would be an exten
sion of an existing program instituted
by Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden. Each year. 10 out of the
426 humanities and sciences faculty
members receive $1000 raises.
