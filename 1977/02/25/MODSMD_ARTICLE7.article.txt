# Sub-subcommittee recommendation
## Mandatory course reviews get first boost 
### Kathy Trafton News Analysis 
The recommendations in the ASSU
Task Force Report on Tenure and
Teaching Quality seem to have been
accepted by a sub-subcommittee of the
Faculty Senate. However, the sub
subcommittee said there may be some
problems with how the recommenda
tions are to be implemented.
The report's major recommendation
deals with instituting a mandatory
student evaluation of every cburse
each time it is offered.
The sub-subcommittee sent its con

elusions to the Subcommittee on the
Evaluation and Improvement of
Teaching Wednesday. The report is
scheduled to go to the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment (CAAA) next week and may
reach the Faculty Senate early next
quarter, according to Greg Larson,
chairperson of the sub-subcommittee.
Larson said that course evaluations
can serve three purposes: they can
provide feedback to the professor for
improving his teaching, they can pro
vide information to aid the decision
process of tenure committees and they
can help students choose classes.
Potential problems
The sub-subcommittee identified
six areas in the report that
should be discussed before the full
subcommittee:
1) The sub-subcommittee stressed
that the evaluation of teaching could
lead to improved teaching.
2) It said that an increased emphasis
on teaching should be desirable for its
own sake. A 50-50 parity in the weight
given to research and teaching in ap
pointments decisions is not necessar
ily desirable it said.
Larry Diamond, chairperson of the
task force that drafted the report, said
that he felt teaching and research

should be weighted equally by the te
nure committees.
3) The sub-subcommittee said that
some estimation of the monetary costs
of carrying out the report's proposals
should be made. The registrar is cur
rently working on this.
4) "Further definition of the prop
osed committee's responsibilities and
composition is necessary." The new
University committee would deal with
implementing the report's recommen
dations.
5) The format should focus on the
teaching quality aspect of the class, not
its entertainment potential.
6) The subcommittee reported that
"the proposal to make the evaluation
results public is one which might lead
to difficulty in gaining the acceptance
of the recommendations of the Task
Force."
Faculty Resistance
Diamond said he thought there will
be "some faculty resistance, I'm sure,
but there will be much less than in

preceeding years" over the proposed
mandatory course evaluations.
He said there may be some feeling
that only some courses should be
evaluated, but it would be a problem to
decide which ones. "You may as well
evaluate everything."
There have been very few reserva
tions about the report's recommenda
tion that retrospective surveys be con
ducted among seniors and recent
graduates. Diamond said.
The recommendation that search
committees make every effort to de
termine the teaching quality of tenure
candidates will be adopted "without
too much change," he said.
The proposal to grant $1000 perma
nent salary raises to professors for ex
cellent teaching would be an exten
sion of an existing program instituted
by Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden. Each year. 10 out of the
426 humanities and sciences faculty
members receive $1000 raises.
There is already money in the Uni
versity budget for faculty salary in
creases, Diamond said. However,
"raises are pretty much determined by
research now." Diamond said that
teaching quality of professors should
be rewarded.
Sub-subcommittee member Allan
Cox, a professor of geophysics, said
there is not enough research to prove
that evaluation leads to better teach
ing.
"We must trust intuition and those
who've already tried it,"he said. The
Business School and the School of En

gineering here have been successful in
their experiments with course evalua
tions, he said.
He said that he personally finds
evaluations of his classes useful. The
existence of evaluations puts pressure
on a teacher to do well, he said.
President Richard Lyman said last
week on Campus Conference that "any
professor who is not stony-hearted is
affected by the presence of those stu
dents in the morning wanting to be
taught." Lyman said he is sympathetic
to the report.
Cox said that faculty resistance to
mandatory course evaluations might

spring from three sources: professors
might think the evaluations are utterly
useless, they might resent losing class
time at the end of the quarter, or they
could dislike the possibility that the
more entertaining professors might get
better evaluations.
'Over achievers'
Everyone on the faculty is an "over
achiever in a certain sense. We are
used to being in the top 10 per cent of
everything we've been in, but half will
be below the median in course evalua
tion results, Cox pointed out.
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering stu
dents' honor society, has met with
much success in its course evaluation
program. However, the Chemical En
gineering Department has fought the
mandatory evaluations.
Assoc. Chemical Engineering Prof.
Robert Madix said he thought it "very
good to have courses evaluated and to
have them fed back to the teachers. But
1 have reservations about the publica
tion of such efforts. It should be confi
dential."
He added that "Whoever evaluates
something should take personal re
sponsibility for it." Personal responsi
bility is not assumed in the data pub
lished.
Teaching is a "marginally reward
ing" job here, according to Madix.
"Rewards come from research, under
standing and creativity in research
fields." Nevertheless, professors put
effort into teaching that goes unde
tected by students, he said.
"Teaching is a big job. Unless it is
handled fairly delicately, it can be to
tally non-rewarding. Negative feed
back can make it so," Madix said.

The proposal to grant $1000 perma
nent salary raises to professors for ex
cellent teaching would be an exten
sion of an existing program instituted
by Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden. Each year. 10 out of the
426 humanities and sciences faculty
members receive $1000 raises.
There is already money in the Uni
versity budget for faculty salary in
creases, Diamond said. However,
"raises are pretty much determined by
research now." Diamond said that
teaching quality of professors should
be rewarded.
Sub-subcommittee member Allan
Cox, a professor of geophysics, said
there is not enough research to prove
that evaluation leads to better teach
ing.
"We must trust intuition and those
who've already tried it,"he said. The
Business School and the School of En

gineering here have been successful in
their experiments with course evalua
tions, he said.
He said that he personally finds
evaluations of his classes useful. The
existence of evaluations puts pressure
on a teacher to do well, he said.
President Richard Lyman said last
week on Campus Conference that "any
professor who is not stony-hearted is
affected by the presence of those stu
dents in the morning wanting to be
taught." Lyman said he is sympathetic
to the report.
Cox said that faculty resistance to
mandatory course evaluations might

spring from three sources: professors
might think the evaluations are utterly
useless, they might resent losing class
time at the end of the quarter, or they
could dislike the possibility that the
more entertaining professors might get
better evaluations.
'Over achievers'
Everyone on the faculty is an "over
achiever in a certain sense. We are
used to being in the top 10 per cent of
everything we've been in, but half will
be below the median in course evalua
tion results, Cox pointed out.
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering stu
dents' honor society, has met with
much success in its course evaluation
program. However, the Chemical En
gineering Department has fought the
mandatory evaluations.
Assoc. Chemical Engineering Prof.
Robert Madix said he thought it "very
good to have courses evaluated and to
have them fed back to the teachers. But
1 have reservations about the publica
tion of such efforts. It should be confi
dential."
He added that "Whoever evaluates
something should take personal re
sponsibility for it." Personal responsi
bility is not assumed in the data pub
lished.
Teaching is a "marginally reward
ing" job here, according to Madix.
"Rewards come from research, under
standing and creativity in research
fields." Nevertheless, professors put
effort into teaching that goes unde
tected by students, he said.
"Teaching is a big job. Unless it is
handled fairly delicately, it can be to
tally non-rewarding. Negative feed
back can make it so," Madix said.
The recommendations in the ASSU
Task Force Report on Tenure and
Teaching Quality seem to have been
accepted by a sub-subcommittee of the
Faculty Senate. However, the sub
subcommittee said there may be some
problems with how the recommenda
tions are to be implemented.
The report's major recommendation
deals with instituting a mandatory
student evaluation of every cburse
each time it is offered.
The sub-subcommittee sent its con

elusions to the Subcommittee on the
Evaluation and Improvement of
Teaching Wednesday. The report is
scheduled to go to the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment (CAAA) next week and may
reach the Faculty Senate early next
quarter, according to Greg Larson,
chairperson of the sub-subcommittee.
Larson said that course evaluations
can serve three purposes: they can
provide feedback to the professor for
improving his teaching, they can pro
vide information to aid the decision
process of tenure committees and they
can help students choose classes.
Potential problems
The sub-subcommittee identified
six areas in the report that
should be discussed before the full
subcommittee:
1) The sub-subcommittee stressed
that the evaluation of teaching could
lead to improved teaching.
2) It said that an increased emphasis
on teaching should be desirable for its
own sake. A 50-50 parity in the weight
given to research and teaching in ap
pointments decisions is not necessar
ily desirable it said.
Larry Diamond, chairperson of the
task force that drafted the report, said
that he felt teaching and research

should be weighted equally by the te
nure committees.
3) The sub-subcommittee said that
some estimation of the monetary costs
of carrying out the report's proposals
should be made. The registrar is cur
rently working on this.
4) "Further definition of the prop
osed committee's responsibilities and
composition is necessary." The new
University committee would deal with
implementing the report's recommen
dations.
5) The format should focus on the
teaching quality aspect of the class, not
its entertainment potential.
6) The subcommittee reported that
"the proposal to make the evaluation
results public is one which might lead
to difficulty in gaining the acceptance
of the recommendations of the Task
Force."
Faculty Resistance
Diamond said he thought there will
be "some faculty resistance, I'm sure,
but there will be much less than in

preceeding years" over the proposed
mandatory course evaluations.
He said there may be some feeling
that only some courses should be
evaluated, but it would be a problem to
decide which ones. "You may as well
evaluate everything."
There have been very few reserva
tions about the report's recommenda
tion that retrospective surveys be con
ducted among seniors and recent
graduates. Diamond said.
The recommendation that search
committees make every effort to de
termine the teaching quality of tenure
candidates will be adopted "without
too much change," he said.

accepted by a sub-subcommittee of the
Faculty Senate. However, the sub
subcommittee said there may be some
problems with how the recommenda
tions are to be implemented.
The report's major recommendation
deals with instituting a mandatory
student evaluation of every cburse
each time it is offered.
The sub-subcommittee sent its con

elusions to the Subcommittee on the
Evaluation and Improvement of
Teaching Wednesday. The report is
scheduled to go to the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment (CAAA) next week and may
reach the Faculty Senate early next
quarter, according to Greg Larson,
chairperson of the sub-subcommittee.
Larson said that course evaluations
can serve three purposes: they can
provide feedback to the professor for
improving his teaching, they can pro
vide information to aid the decision
process of tenure committees and they
can help students choose classes.
Potential problems
The sub-subcommittee identified
six areas in the report that
should be discussed before the full
subcommittee:
1) The sub-subcommittee stressed
that the evaluation of teaching could
lead to improved teaching.
2) It said that an increased emphasis
on teaching should be desirable for its
own sake. A 50-50 parity in the weight
given to research and teaching in ap
pointments decisions is not necessar
ily desirable it said.
Larry Diamond, chairperson of the
task force that drafted the report, said
that he felt teaching and research

should be weighted equally by the te
nure committees.
3) The sub-subcommittee said that
some estimation of the monetary costs
of carrying out the report's proposals
should be made. The registrar is cur
rently working on this.
4) "Further definition of the prop
osed committee's responsibilities and
composition is necessary." The new
University committee would deal with
implementing the report's recommen
dations.
5) The format should focus on the
teaching quality aspect of the class, not
its entertainment potential.
6) The subcommittee reported that
"the proposal to make the evaluation
results public is one which might lead
to difficulty in gaining the acceptance
of the recommendations of the Task
Force."
Faculty Resistance
Diamond said he thought there will
be "some faculty resistance, I'm sure,
but there will be much less than in

preceeding years" over the proposed
mandatory course evaluations.
He said there may be some feeling
that only some courses should be
evaluated, but it would be a problem to
decide which ones. "You may as well
evaluate everything."
There have been very few reserva
tions about the report's recommenda
tion that retrospective surveys be con
ducted among seniors and recent
graduates. Diamond said.
The recommendation that search
committees make every effort to de
termine the teaching quality of tenure
candidates will be adopted "without
too much change," he said.
The proposal to grant $1000 perma
nent salary raises to professors for ex
cellent teaching would be an exten
sion of an existing program instituted
by Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden. Each year. 10 out of the
426 humanities and sciences faculty
members receive $1000 raises.
There is already money in the Uni
versity budget for faculty salary in
creases, Diamond said. However,
"raises are pretty much determined by
research now." Diamond said that
teaching quality of professors should
be rewarded.
Sub-subcommittee member Allan
Cox, a professor of geophysics, said
there is not enough research to prove
that evaluation leads to better teach
ing.
"We must trust intuition and those
who've already tried it,"he said. The
Business School and the School of En

gineering here have been successful in
their experiments with course evalua
tions, he said.
He said that he personally finds
evaluations of his classes useful. The
existence of evaluations puts pressure
on a teacher to do well, he said.
President Richard Lyman said last
week on Campus Conference that "any
professor who is not stony-hearted is
affected by the presence of those stu
dents in the morning wanting to be
taught." Lyman said he is sympathetic
to the report.
Cox said that faculty resistance to
mandatory course evaluations might

spring from three sources: professors
might think the evaluations are utterly
useless, they might resent losing class
time at the end of the quarter, or they
could dislike the possibility that the
more entertaining professors might get
better evaluations.
'Over achievers'
Everyone on the faculty is an "over
achiever in a certain sense. We are
used to being in the top 10 per cent of
everything we've been in, but half will
be below the median in course evalua
tion results, Cox pointed out.
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering stu
dents' honor society, has met with
much success in its course evaluation
program. However, the Chemical En
gineering Department has fought the
mandatory evaluations.
Assoc. Chemical Engineering Prof.
Robert Madix said he thought it "very
good to have courses evaluated and to
have them fed back to the teachers. But
1 have reservations about the publica
tion of such efforts. It should be confi
dential."
He added that "Whoever evaluates
something should take personal re
sponsibility for it." Personal responsi
bility is not assumed in the data pub
lished.
Teaching is a "marginally reward
ing" job here, according to Madix.
"Rewards come from research, under
standing and creativity in research
fields." Nevertheless, professors put
effort into teaching that goes unde
tected by students, he said.
"Teaching is a big job. Unless it is
handled fairly delicately, it can be to
tally non-rewarding. Negative feed
back can make it so," Madix said.
