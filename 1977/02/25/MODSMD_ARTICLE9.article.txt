## Opinions Elm treatment a threat 
### 
Matt Haber

In a move showing lack of fiscal and ecological responsi
bility, the State Department of Agriculture and the Univer
sity have decided to eradicate Dutch Elm disease on campus
by spraying methoxychlor, a chemical "harmless to hu
mans" which we are told damages plants and the finish on
cars. However, the supposed harmlessness of methoxychlor
and the advisability of spraying at all are doubtful.
Methoxychlor is a member of the chemical family known
as chlorinated hydrocarbons, of which DDT and DDD are
closely related members. One of the properties of chlori
nated hydrocarbons is that they are fat soluble. That is, once
introduced into the body, they lodge in the fat cells and are
difficult to flush out of the system.
Build-up
Thus, while one exposure to the pesticide may not be
immediately harmful, repeated exposures build up the
level of chemical in the body, with a high potential for
harm.
The recommended maximum level of intake of
methoxychlor per day is two milligrams per kilogram of
weight. Even assuming that no more than that amount is
introduced to the body, liver damage by prior exposure to
other insecticides, carbon tetrochloride or certain tran
quilizing drugs is highly likely, especially for workers in
volved in the spraying process.
Endangers food chain
If the effects of methoxychlor on humans are potentially
so dangerous, they are more deadly to other forms of life.
The most obvious among these are birds. Unfortunately, the
reaction is not immediate, but happens only when the pes
ticide has gone through the food chain.
In doing so, the pesticide is concentrated at every step.

Parallel cases occured in the early '60s. Elm trees were
sprayed with DDT to kill elm bark beetles which spread
Dutch Elm disease. Birds were killed after ingesting twelve
earthworms which contained concentrated amounts of
DDT.
The danger is not limited to the ecological community in
the neighborhood of Salvatierra Street. The Daily stated
that state crews will wash down the area after spraying.
This will expose the area downstream from the original
spraying to methoxychlor.
One of the potentially most harmful of the effects of
spraying is the destruction of insect life other than the elm
bark beetle. Methoxychlor is a non-discriminating pes
ticide — it kills 'good' insects as well as 'bad.'
Alternative
What, then is the alternative? The experience of many
eastern states, who have had to cope with Dutch Elm dis
ease since 1930, indicates that the only way to control the
disease is the removal and destruction of all potentially
diseased wood in which the beetles might be living.
In addition to controlling the disease, steps must be taken
to prevent future infection. The European elm is highly
resistant to the disease and could replace diseased trees.
Also, planting a variety of trees will lessen the concentra
tion one species in an area and make any future problem
easier to control.
It has been fifteen years since Rachel Carson wrote Silent
Spring. The University and the State Department of Ag
riculture are ignoring the ecological realities that she
pointed out to us then. It is time we stop trying to control
nature and try to live in harmony with her.

Parallel cases occured in the early '60s. Elm trees were
sprayed with DDT to kill elm bark beetles which spread
Dutch Elm disease. Birds were killed after ingesting twelve
earthworms which contained concentrated amounts of
DDT.
The danger is not limited to the ecological community in
the neighborhood of Salvatierra Street. The Daily stated
that state crews will wash down the area after spraying.
This will expose the area downstream from the original
spraying to methoxychlor.
One of the potentially most harmful of the effects of
spraying is the destruction of insect life other than the elm
bark beetle. Methoxychlor is a non-discriminating pes
ticide — it kills 'good' insects as well as 'bad.'
Alternative
What, then is the alternative? The experience of many
eastern states, who have had to cope with Dutch Elm dis
ease since 1930, indicates that the only way to control the
disease is the removal and destruction of all potentially
diseased wood in which the beetles might be living.
In addition to controlling the disease, steps must be taken
to prevent future infection. The European elm is highly
resistant to the disease and could replace diseased trees.
Also, planting a variety of trees will lessen the concentra
tion one species in an area and make any future problem
easier to control.
It has been fifteen years since Rachel Carson wrote Silent
Spring. The University and the State Department of Ag
riculture are ignoring the ecological realities that she
pointed out to us then. It is time we stop trying to control
nature and try to live in harmony with her.

In a move showing lack of fiscal and ecological responsi
bility, the State Department of Agriculture and the Univer
sity have decided to eradicate Dutch Elm disease on campus
by spraying methoxychlor, a chemical "harmless to hu
mans" which we are told damages plants and the finish on
cars. However, the supposed harmlessness of methoxychlor
and the advisability of spraying at all are doubtful.
Methoxychlor is a member of the chemical family known
as chlorinated hydrocarbons, of which DDT and DDD are
closely related members. One of the properties of chlori
nated hydrocarbons is that they are fat soluble. That is, once
introduced into the body, they lodge in the fat cells and are
difficult to flush out of the system.
Build-up
Thus, while one exposure to the pesticide may not be
immediately harmful, repeated exposures build up the
level of chemical in the body, with a high potential for
harm.
The recommended maximum level of intake of
methoxychlor per day is two milligrams per kilogram of
weight. Even assuming that no more than that amount is
introduced to the body, liver damage by prior exposure to
other insecticides, carbon tetrochloride or certain tran
quilizing drugs is highly likely, especially for workers in
volved in the spraying process.
Endangers food chain
If the effects of methoxychlor on humans are potentially
so dangerous, they are more deadly to other forms of life.
The most obvious among these are birds. Unfortunately, the
reaction is not immediate, but happens only when the pes
ticide has gone through the food chain.
In doing so, the pesticide is concentrated at every step.
