### Robert Mauro 
Public safety officers are still inves
tigating a bike theft ring broken up by
the Department of Public Safety last
week, according to Investigations
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Six Menlo Park juveniles were taken
into custody last week on charges of
possession of stolen property and 10
stolen bikes were recovered in the ac
tion, according to Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said an anonymous caller
told police last Wednesday night that a
bike theft might have been in progress
near Governor's Extension by Roble
Field.
Sgt. Marvin Moore responded to the
call to find three bikes lying on the
ground amidst hacksawed chains and
cables.
While searching the surrounding
area, he spotted a tennis shoe protrud
ing from the bushes: and upon closer
inspection, saw its owner hiding
under a jacket.
During the subsequent interview,
Detective Art Nebgen said he learned
the identity of the youth's two ac
complices. Together with Agent Rosie
Bilbro of the Menlo Park Police De
partment. Nebgen located three other
juveniles working with the ring. By 9
a.m. Thursday, all six had been ap
prehended.
No tip, no pinch
"It was a pretty damn good piece of
work; but if we didn't get the tip, we
wouldn't have made the pinch," said
Niemeyer. "The people have got to call
in. . . .We've got to thank the anony
mous caller—without his info it would
have been three more bikes stolen."
According to Niemeyer, the six
youths, all students at Menlo-Atherton
High School, were "good for a lot more
(thefts), but there is no indication that
they were actually selling the bikes.
They'd ride it for a while and when
they got a flat or something they'd steal
another."
According to Niemeyer, the youths
had previously come to the attention of
the Menlo Park police after they had
been seen constantly riding different
bikes.
Bilbro said the ring had been in op
eration for about 1-1 Vi years.
Niemeyer said the owners of four of
the recovered bicycles could not be de
termined and that the owner of a fifth
could not be located.
Officers are currently looking for the
owners of several 10-speed bikes: a
purple Peugeot frame number 855388,
a blue Raleigh frame number
NK5204297, a gold Nishiki frame
number KF03787, and a green Tiger
with partial frame number T50429-.
The last djget had been obliterated.
Unlocatable
The registered owner of a green
Peugeot, Jeff Thompson, could not be
located.
The owners of these bicycles should
contact the Department of Public
Safety as soon as possible. The bikes
will then be photographed as evidence
and returned to their owners.
According to Nebgen. bicycles must
be positively identified before they can
be used as evidence in court.

Public safety officers are still inves
tigating a bike theft ring broken up by
the Department of Public Safety last
week, according to Investigations
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Six Menlo Park juveniles were taken
into custody last week on charges of
possession of stolen property and 10
stolen bikes were recovered in the ac
tion, according to Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said an anonymous caller
told police last Wednesday night that a
bike theft might have been in progress
near Governor's Extension by Roble
Field.
Sgt. Marvin Moore responded to the
call to find three bikes lying on the
ground amidst hacksawed chains and
cables.
While searching the surrounding
area, he spotted a tennis shoe protrud
ing from the bushes: and upon closer
inspection, saw its owner hiding
under a jacket.
During the subsequent interview,
Detective Art Nebgen said he learned
the identity of the youth's two ac
complices. Together with Agent Rosie
Bilbro of the Menlo Park Police De
partment. Nebgen located three other
juveniles working with the ring. By 9
a.m. Thursday, all six had been ap
prehended.
No tip, no pinch
"It was a pretty damn good piece of
work; but if we didn't get the tip, we
wouldn't have made the pinch," said
Niemeyer. "The people have got to call
in. . . .We've got to thank the anony
mous caller—without his info it would
have been three more bikes stolen."
According to Niemeyer, the six
youths, all students at Menlo-Atherton
High School, were "good for a lot more
(thefts), but there is no indication that
they were actually selling the bikes.
They'd ride it for a while and when
they got a flat or something they'd steal
another."
According to Niemeyer, the youths
had previously come to the attention of
the Menlo Park police after they had
been seen constantly riding different
bikes.
Bilbro said the ring had been in op
eration for about 1-1 Vi years.
Niemeyer said the owners of four of
the recovered bicycles could not be de
termined and that the owner of a fifth
could not be located.
Officers are currently looking for the
owners of several 10-speed bikes: a
purple Peugeot frame number 855388,
a blue Raleigh frame number
NK5204297, a gold Nishiki frame
number KF03787, and a green Tiger
with partial frame number T50429-.
The last djget had been obliterated.
Unlocatable
The registered owner of a green
Peugeot, Jeff Thompson, could not be
located.
The owners of these bicycles should
contact the Department of Public
Safety as soon as possible. The bikes
will then be photographed as evidence
and returned to their owners.
