We believe that a better institutional arrangement is
needed for familiarizing new graduate students with
facilities on and around the University campus. The ab
sence of such a program is, in our opinion, one of the largest
faults of Stanford's graduate curriculum.
Many graduate students have asserted that their entry
into this community was an upsetting and chaotic experi
ence. Often arriving with no friends or contacts in the area
— and perhaps fresh from a rather sheltered undergraduate
existence — the student has no one to turn to for advice or
suggestions. The difficulties of settling into an apartment in
a new environment, finding places to eat and have fun, and
learning where to make contact with other students or cam
pus organizations, are magnified by the inadequacy of the
University's welcoming efforts. A well-structured graduate
orientation would help new students quickly find a com
fortable niche which fits their needs. Graduate life need not
be just an endless daily trek between apartment, depart
ment and library compartment!
Most graduate departments do make some effort to ac
quaint new students with their academic programs, the

faculty, and each other, but there remains almost no attempt
to inform those students about the rest of the university
system. A smattering of university-wide orientation ser
vices are available, such as the residentail clearing-house,
the graduate convocation ceremonies, and some of the
Bechtel activities, but in general the problems particular to
incoming graduates get little direct attention.
In the past months we have discussed this issue at length,
in hopes of singling out a few particularly important ac
tivities, and have found this no simple or straightforward
task. Consequently, we are recommending instead that the
Committee on Student Services (COSS), with the coopera
tion of both the dean of students and the graduate dean
(perhaps with some participation from members of the
Committee on Graduate Studies), establish a small plan
ning group to examine this question.
This committee should review the freshman and transfer
orientation procedures, with an eye to which of those ac
tivities might appropriately be opened to new incoming
graduates, and generate a list of additional events which are
specifically needed by these people. Student input should
be solicited at all stages of this process, perhaps with ques
tionnaires or open discussion meetings. We hope that by
this means a workable and successful graduate orientation
can be developed in time for next year's entering students.
Some general comments follow as possible guidelines for
this effort. First, any graduate orientation program should
be institutionalized in a manner similar to the well
designed undergraduate orientations. Second, any such
series should seek a coordinated balance between
departmental-level and university-wide functions, not only
to avoid schedule conflicts but also to reflect more accu
rately the special characteristics of the graduate situation.
Third, students should be actively involved in both the
conception and administration of whatever activities are
chosen at both the department, and university levels.
Despite the usual reluctance of graduate students to par
ticpate in such matters, we feel that the need for this prog
ram is sufficiently great — and the effects of its absence so
universal — that it warrants a considerable expenditure of
energy on the part of students and university officials. Such
time would indeed by well spent.

pus organizations, are magnified by the inadequacy of the
University's welcoming efforts. A well-structured graduate
orientation would help new students quickly find a com
fortable niche which fits their needs. Graduate life need not
be just an endless daily trek between apartment, depart
ment and library compartment!
Most graduate departments do make some effort to ac
quaint new students with their academic programs, the

faculty, and each other, but there remains almost no attempt
to inform those students about the rest of the university
system. A smattering of university-wide orientation ser
vices are available, such as the residentail clearing-house,
the graduate convocation ceremonies, and some of the
Bechtel activities, but in general the problems particular to
incoming graduates get little direct attention.
In the past months we have discussed this issue at length,
in hopes of singling out a few particularly important ac
tivities, and have found this no simple or straightforward
task. Consequently, we are recommending instead that the
Committee on Student Services (COSS), with the coopera
tion of both the dean of students and the graduate dean
(perhaps with some participation from members of the
Committee on Graduate Studies), establish a small plan
ning group to examine this question.
This committee should review the freshman and transfer
orientation procedures, with an eye to which of those ac
tivities might appropriately be opened to new incoming
graduates, and generate a list of additional events which are
specifically needed by these people. Student input should
be solicited at all stages of this process, perhaps with ques
tionnaires or open discussion meetings. We hope that by
this means a workable and successful graduate orientation
can be developed in time for next year's entering students.
Some general comments follow as possible guidelines for
this effort. First, any graduate orientation program should
be institutionalized in a manner similar to the well
designed undergraduate orientations. Second, any such
series should seek a coordinated balance between
departmental-level and university-wide functions, not only
to avoid schedule conflicts but also to reflect more accu
rately the special characteristics of the graduate situation.
Third, students should be actively involved in both the
conception and administration of whatever activities are
chosen at both the department, and university levels.
Despite the usual reluctance of graduate students to par
ticpate in such matters, we feel that the need for this prog
ram is sufficiently great — and the effects of its absence so
universal — that it warrants a considerable expenditure of
energy on the part of students and university officials. Such
time would indeed by well spent.

We believe that a better institutional arrangement is
needed for familiarizing new graduate students with
facilities on and around the University campus. The ab
sence of such a program is, in our opinion, one of the largest
faults of Stanford's graduate curriculum.
Many graduate students have asserted that their entry
into this community was an upsetting and chaotic experi
ence. Often arriving with no friends or contacts in the area
— and perhaps fresh from a rather sheltered undergraduate
existence — the student has no one to turn to for advice or
suggestions. The difficulties of settling into an apartment in
a new environment, finding places to eat and have fun, and
learning where to make contact with other students or cam
pus organizations, are magnified by the inadequacy of the
University's welcoming efforts. A well-structured graduate
orientation would help new students quickly find a com
fortable niche which fits their needs. Graduate life need not
