Two recent campus events offer dis
concerting evidence of academics who
assume that their particular intellec
tual gifts exempt them from social re
sponsibility and ethical concern. They
raise questions about the kind of edu
cation some of us are getting here, and
the commitments of those who pro
vide it.
The first event was an interview
with Milton Friedman in which the
economist discusses, among other
things, his role as consultant to the
dictator of Chile. Acknowledging his
meetings with the government of Gen
eral Augusto Pinochet, Friedman de
clares, "I always say the same thing in
public as I say in private," and adds, "I
am not going to take any responsibility
for policies of the junta."
One need not dispute the veracity of
the first statement to find the second
reprehensible.
'Acquiescence'
Friedman's economic ideas are
known throughout the world. The
generals invited him, not to ask his
advice on methods of interrogation by
electric probe or political execution
techniques in which they give all the
lessons, but to solicit help with
specific applications of economic
theory. Of course that is what Fried
man gave, in private as in public.
But surely any aid — however re
stricted in nature — implies a mod
icum of acquiescence in the behavior
of one's client. It is perverse to sup at a
torturer's table and say, "What he does
from nine to five is not my concern."
Friedman says that, as an expert on
inflation, he went where inflation
existed, just as geologists seek out
mountains and oceanographers go to
sea. It is extraordinary to find a recent
Nobel laureate peddling the kind of
analogies between natural and social
science that emerged intheGilded Age
and have long since been discredited.
Affecting humans
Mountains do not erode when
geologists observe them; marine
biologists do not redirect the ocean
currents. But economic planning is a

method of social manipulation. The
objects of manipulation are human be
ings. And the manipulations Fried
man helped design are enforced with a
brutal disregard for human rights that
supercedes mere "study."
Friedman's convenient separation
of expertise from the moral context in
which it is applied reflects a gross con
fusion of ends and means. Most of us
are familiar with nouveau riche be
havior patterns that value display of
wealth abo\ys the standards of taste it
might secure.
Abstract theory
More recently, we've grown sensi
tive to the limitations of technology
pursued as a value in its own right.
Friedman's stance suggests a third
parallel which we in academia are all
too often blind to — infatuation with
the pursuit, not of wealth or gadgetry.

but of intellectual systems adhered to
without regard to their social impact.
Particular human sympathy yields to
the fascination of abstract theory.
I am reminded of Harold Ickes' reply
to a Depression economist who
claimed that short term unemploy
ment would bring recovery in the long
run. "People," barked Ickes, "don't eat
in the long run."
In the case of Friedman, it is a short
step from studying inflation as a
mathematical model (in which con
siderations of human freedom are
tangential) to viewing Chilean citi
zens' lives as the proper ground on
which to test abstract hypotheses.
(Tomorrow, professional responsibil
ity during current discussions on gene
tic regulation will be discussed. Har
vey Oxenhorn is a graduate student in
English.)
