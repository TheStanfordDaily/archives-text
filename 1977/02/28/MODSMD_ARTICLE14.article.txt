# Cancer may be linked to more menstrual cycles

Women are experiencing more menstrua!
periods during their lifetimethan ever before. This
exposure to fluctuating levels of estrogen before a
first pregnancy may be responsible for the increas
ing incidence of breast and possibly other cancers,
according to Roger Short, director of the medical
research unit in reproductive biology in Edin
burgh, Scotland.
Speaking to a departmental seminar- in chemis
try earlier this month, Short noted that where once
women had approximately MO menstrual cycles
interspersed between menarche and pregnancies,
women now have up to 500 such menstrual
periods.
"Given that only HO generations have passed
since Jesus Christ," he remarked, "we haven't had
much chance to adapt genetically."
Today, women who have never had children
show a significantly increased occurrence of
breast cancer, fibroids, ovarian cancer and en
dometrical cancer. The only cancer that is more
prevalent in women who have had children is cer
vical cancer, he said. One factor that may influence
the incidence of breast cancer is the increased
length of time between menarche and a woman's
first pregnancy.
Citing a Harvard University study, Short said
that the majority of women in a variety qf cultures
studied appear to reach puberty at a critical weight
of 47 kilos. Nutritional standards in developed
countries have caused this to occur at earlier ages
â€”apparently leveling off at between 12V2 and 13
years of age.
More activity
Short noted that sexual development is weight
dependent while intellectual development is
calendar-age dependent. This results in more
younger women engaging in sexual activity, he
said.
He told the audience that 16 per cent of the 1H
million 12 to 14 year olds in the United States
today had had sexual experiences. He added that
50 per cent of the 21 million 15 to 19 year olds had
had sexual experiences.
Up until now, Short noted, lactation has been
the most effective form of birth control around the
world. This is obviously not the case in developed
countries today. Most do not become pregnant for
years after their first ovulatory cycle.
Lactation declined
Short added that even among women having
children, lactation had declined as an effective
method of suppressing ovulation in developed
countries because of a decreased exposure of the
baby to the breast and increased availability of
alternative baby foods.
Noting that women are fertile longer, Short
said, couples are now using contraception to space
pregnancies or to avoid pregnancy once the de
sired family size is reached.
Excluding complete hysterectomy, all present
methods of birth control subject women in de

veloped countries to repetitive fluctuations in bod
ily hormones resulting from longer periods in the
non-pregnant state. Short said this has made "the
menstrual cycle a disorder of civilized com
munities."
Hormone sensitivity
To support his argument, he pointed out that
women are the only female primates in which
breast development occurs at puberty. He pre
sented data from studies demonstrating the sen
sitivity ot the female breast to the hormone estro
gen and studies relating the risk of breast cancer to
the length of time between the woman's first
menstrual cycle and her first pregnancy.
Studies have shown that women who have never
had children have a higher risk of breast cancer
while women who wait until they are 40 to have a
child enhance this risk still further.
Given the occurrence of sexual development
long before parenthood, Short suggested that fu
ture contraceptives should be developed with the
risks of menstruation before pregnancy in mind.
Short said his own research revealed that 80 per
cent of the women he studied did not miss their
menstrual cycles when one menstrual period was
artificially suppressed by an B4 day contraceptive
pill. He added that the optima] way to prevent
pregnancy without biological or artificial steroid
loads has not yet been found.
Possibilities include inoculations that would ef
fectively put the ovaries to sleep for months or
synthetic analogues that would inhibit the
menstrual cycle in the same way lactation
abolishes the positive effect of estrogen in the
menstrual cycle.
