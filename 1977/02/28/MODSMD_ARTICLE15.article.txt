# Talks on Brazil nuclear deal start

### 
Brasilia, Brazil (AP) â€” A high-level U.S. delega
tion arrives here this week for sensitive talks on
Brazil's controversial nuclear deal with West Ger
many, a cherished project of the Brazilians that is
strongly opposed by the Garter administration.
The United States opposes the German-
Brazilian agreement because it would give Brazil
the equipment to produce plutonium, an essential
ingredient for making nuclear weapons, and could
lead to further proliferation of nuclear know-how.
Last November, then-President-elect Jimmy Gar
ter said he would seek through normal diplomatic
channels to abrogate the sale of plutonium repro
cessing plants to Brazil, as well as a similar deal
between France and Pakistan.
The German-Brazilian agreement, signed 19
months ago. provides for the largest wholesale
transfer of nuclear technology ever contracted be
tween two states, and both sides expect a rich
return.
