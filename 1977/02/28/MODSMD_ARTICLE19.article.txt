# Press report compiled for Carter
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Six evenings a week,
between 9 and 10 p.m., a member of the
White House staff drops off a sheaf of papers
assembled for an exclusive audience of one:
the president of the United States.
It is the White House news summary, gen
erally a 10-page compilation of recent news
lifted from news service wires, the nation's
newspapers and network television prog
nuns. It is designed to give the president a
quick, concise, easy-to-read view of world,
national and regional events and how they
were covered by the news media.
So, on late Wednesday evening, reading
the news summary dated Thursday, Feb. 24,
Carter could have learned, for instance, that
Gulf Oil Go. had been charged with with
holding natural gas, that delays he advo
cated in 19 water projects were angering
Congress, or that exotic birds may carry a
disease deadly to poultry.
The news summary is put together by five
persons who work in a first-floor, carpeted
suite in the old Executive Office Building
next door to the White House on Pennsyl
vania Avenue.
Each day they read the news wires of The
Associated Press and United Press Interna
tional, watch the three commercial net
works' television news shows and scan as
many as 100 newspapers. They subscribe to
33 papers and receive twice as many on a
complimentary basis.

The office director is Claudia Townsend, a
24-year-old Georgian who had worked as a
reporter in Atlanta and Washington cover
ing Jimmy Carter the governor and Jimmy
Carter the candidate.
"We are not, don't want to be, and don't
pretend to be Carter's only source of informa
tion," she said. "We give him a general over
view on what is happening in the national
news."
She said the president reads The New
York Times and Washington Post each
morning but that without the news summary
he would be unlikely to know what other
newspapers around the country were carry
ing.
Most of the newspapers arrive by mail,
several days after they are published. The
staff looks for items that often reflect reg
ional concerns.
Spots drought
Townsend said by reading Western pap
ers, her staff was able to spot concern about
the drought and bring it to Carter's attention
before it was a national story.
Most of the items are not much longer than
100 words and each gives the newspaper
from which it is taken. Occasionally the
president asks to see the entire story.
The direct, to-the-point summary is de
signed "to give him condensed information
real quickly," Townsend said. "I assume he

doesn't spend much time on it. If he does,
we're not doing it right."
The president, she said, "reads it front to
back. It is in his out box by 7 a.m., with his
initials on it, meaning he's read it."
Only reaction
The only reaction to the daily summary
she has gotten from Carter, who is known to
make his displeasure with a staff product
clear, was a brief "good, |.C." scribbled on an
office memorandum asking for comments on
the early issues.
But he criticized a weekly compilation of
magazine stories, saying they were too long
and the sample was too smali. Changes were
made in the next issue and Carter sent back a
note of approval.
The magazine summary culls 37 periodi
cals, among them Psychology Today, Busi
ness Week, the New Yorker, Ebony, Playboy
and People.
Nixon's summary
When the news summary was published
for Richard Nixon, it departed occasionally
from its dry objectivity to characterize a story
as "positive," meaning favorable to the ad
ministration, or terming a television report
as a correspondent's "wise remarks."
When the news summary was published
for Gerald Ford, it ran anywhere from 20 to
50 pages and was prepared by eight persons,
all of whom have left the staff.
