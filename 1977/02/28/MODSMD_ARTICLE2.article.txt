# Diggs: U.S. backing, not troops in S. Africa

"Africans don't expect us to become
involved in the armed struggles" in
African nations and "public opinion
in the United States wouldn't support
it anyway," Rep. Charles Diggs Jr.
(D-Mich.) said last night.
Diggs, a member of the House sub
committee on Africa, said he did not
expect the United States to become di
rectly involved in any "military exer
cise" in the African movements. How
ever, he said, "I certainly support the
use of struggle by those who are di
rectly involved, but that's much diffe
rent than the United States moving in
for its special interests."
Diggs addressed about 30 people in
Kresge Auditorium as part of a sym
posium on black liberation at home
and abroad. Nearly 30 others left be
fore the congressman arrived 75 mi
nutes late due to car trouble.
During a question and answer
period, Diggs said the United States
would "feel obliged" to rescue Ameri
cans now in Uganda, if they were in
danger.
Rescue
"There is no question in my mind
that if the security of some 240 Ameri
cans were in jeopardy, we would feel
obliged to rescue them," he said.
However, "I don't think that's going
to happen," he said, explaining that
the people left in Uganda are mostly
missionaries who would have left long
ago if they felt personally threatened.
Questioned later by the Daily, Diggs
said the United States would consider
killing any of the Americans as "seri

ous provocation" and the government
would take "appropriate action." He
refused to elaborate on what that ac
tion might entail.
He admitted such a move by Amin
would have a negative effect on how
some congressmen regard Africa, even
though he said Amin is "no more typi
cal of Africa than Hitler of Germany or
George Wallace of the United States."
In his speech, Uiggs emphasized the
large role Africa would play in the fu
ture.
"It is the developing countries,
which includes Africa, to a large ex
tent, who have really become the prin
ciple locus of conflict in the world and
the outcome of that conflict is going to
profoundly influence global issues for
generations to come," he said.
'New challenges'
"We are going to have new chal
lenges to the industrial consumers by
the developing country producers of
critical materials, so the next two de
cades will be characterized by efforts
to force a more equ itab le sharing of t he
world's wealth — not only between the
rich and poor nations but also within
nations," he continued.
He said the United States would
have to face up to the need for a "more
serious commitment and deeper un
derstanding maldistribution of power
both here and abroad."
He concluded we must realize "the
American genius is deadly without a
moral foundation, without some un
derstanding of the implications of the
international environment."
