Thirty students from Stanford
and other Bay Area schools met
in Cubberley Auditorium this
weekend for a seminar on cam
paign techniques.
The College Republican Na
tional Committee (CRNC), the of
ficial student organ of the Re
publican National Committee,
holds such "Student Fieldman
Schools" at various universities
throughout the year.
"The committee is attempting
to heighten the quality of leader
ship locally," said Karl Rove,
chairman of the organization,
"and to train campaign talent for
regular campaigns."
The Fieldman School con
ducts its seminars on an almost
scientific basis. According to
Rove, the seminars are designed
to "attract actives in the Repub
lican party on campus." The
seminars teach such campaign
tactics as "targeting" ("the use of
election statistics, census , and
legislative analysis") as well as
the effective use of the "press,
media and voter registration."
The committee has no official
platform beyond that of the Na
tional Committee, said Rove, but
it does "promote" issues on oc

casion. The CRNC is currently
"in favor of regional presidential
primaries" and such things as
"tax credit for college tuition,"
he said.
But the major stress on
specific issues comes from the
state level, said Rove. For exam
ple, Kile Smith, chairman of the
California College Republicans,
was "behind the (legislative) re
forms on marijuana in the state,"
claimed Rove.
How are the College Republi
cans faring nationwide? Accord
ing to Rove, the numbers of stu
dent Republicans has been "in
creasing since Aug. 8, 1974."
The CRNC is now the nation's
largest political group, he said,
with over 150,000 members on
over 1000 campuses. He added
that students preferred Ford over
Carter in the 1976 presidential
election.
And the cause of this conser
vative trend on college cam
puses? Rove explained that stu
dents are feeling the general
waves of conservatism that are
"reflected in the community."
"The nation is tired of the New
Deal experience," said Rove.
"Platforms (that were) decided
40yearsagoareirrelevant now."
