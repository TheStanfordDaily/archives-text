# Phelps explores human behavior and self-defense
## 
### Karen Caesar 
Shannon Phelps is a softspo
ken, gentle, dark-eyed young
man of 28 years who is thinking
of entering the priesthood and
can severely maim or injure if
not actually kill with his bare
hands.
A political science under
graduate, Shannon is a martial
artist of a very special sort, and
he is offering an all-day work
shop to tentatively be held
Saturday, April 2 that will give
him a chance to introduce his art
to the University community. It
will consist of "some presenta
tions and demonstrations and
panel discussions where the au
dience will be invited to partici
pate," says Shannon, and the
speakers will probably include
members of the Palo Alto Police
Department or the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety.
Kick-off
Shannon's "art" is the art of
self-defense, and the workshop
will hopefully serve as a kick-off
for a class to be offered under the
auspices of the Physical Educa
tion Department next quarter
(even though it is not in the new
Time Schedule), entitled "Hu
man Behavior in Self-Defense."
"1 learned the hard way," he
says with a reflective chuckle. "I
learned the importance of self
defense on the street. I fooled
around with karate while I was
in my teens, but it was junk fight
ing really. 1 thought street fight
ing was much superior."
Growing up in South Chicago
he had plenty of opportunities to
experiment with street fighting.
He finds, not too surprisingly,
that this is not something many
Stanford people can relate to. "I
don't talk about it too much be
cause a lot of people around
here, they kind cf look at you and
say 'Gee, you were a hoodlum,
Wow!' What I really learned to

do was/ight the hoodlums." he
says.
After serving as student body
president in a mostly black
•ghetto high school, Shannon left
to join the Air Force. He was 18,
it was 1967, and there was a war
going on. He left for Vietnam.
Green Berets
"I was the intelligence liaison
officer for a Green Beret outfit,"
he says simply. His job was to
"get the Green Berets their air
cover in a fire fight " Although
he explains his role without any
surface emotion, it is obvious
that this is a subject Shannon has
wrestled with for quite a while.
"I have a tremendous amount
of self-reflection on that war that
denies a tremendous amount of
the generalizations made by
both the extremists, the liberals
and the conservatives," he says
firmly. "They use tired cliches
and they really don't understand
the ramifications of the whole
thing. I really felt like it was jus
tified when 1 was there." But
primarily as a result of his intro
duction to Buddhism and his
training in a kind of "killer" ka
rate, he doesn't feel that way
now.
"While I was in the Green Be
rets, 1 was trained in the Korean
style karate, which is really kil
ler karate. Their motto is 'one
kick, one kill.' That was Teally a
sophisticated kind of karate. It
was brutal and it was pure com
bat. It wasn't self-defense at all."
This "killer" karate Shannon
describes as employing "about
80 per cent feet. . . mostly using
kicks and sweeps, not so much
the punching hands."
No more involvement
But it was by talking to the
Vietnamese that ' Shannon
realized he didn't want to be in
volved in killing anymore,
whether it was through karate or
through the Air Force.

"I began to re-evaluate my
politics and philosophy about
our whole involvement in the
war. It was something 1 had to
discover on my own. I had every
reason to be gung-ho. When you
have coffee with your best friend
in the morning and a memorial
service in the afternoon, you get
angry. You feel like fighting.
"But insanity depends a lot on
where you are. 1 would have
been considered insane if I'd
been talking about peace over
there. It would have been an act
of treason."
So Shannon was subtle in de
veloping his philosophy of
"treason." "1 began initiating my
own private policy of benign
neglect in my job." He says he
was influenced by the "Buddhis
tic and pacificist attitudes of the
villagers. They were so tranquil
in spite of the tragedies that to
tally swarmed their environ
ment.
"The main point," continues
Shannon, "was that I became
disenchanted with our involve
ment in Vietnam — it became
very clear to me that we had no
business there."
Hong Kong
So Shannon left Vietnam and
went to Hong Kong, where he
encountered more martial ar
tists. "They dumped me on my
rear end and showed me very
quickly that soft hand
techniques were far superior to
these hard feet techniques."
Hong Kong was a source of re
velation for Shannon. He
studied with an old Buddhist
monk who taught him the "soft
system," but taught it to be used
as a "vehicle toward pacifism."
Says Shannon of this
mysterious monk: "He taught
me how to light in order to take
the fight out of me."
After spending almost two

years in Hong Kong, at the end of
1971 Shannon returned to Il
linois. It began to annoy Shan
non how people "talk in
generalities and cliches about it
(the martial arts) in this country.
I thought they were diluting and
perverting the art as I under
stood it. They were making pro
fit off it materially, but were
philosophically barren."
"So," says Shannon, "I came
to California, got accepted to
Stanford, and I met Master
Saito." The rest is history.
'Ninjitsu master'
Saito is a "Ninjitsu master."
Shannon describes Ninjitsu as a
"family art that goes back many
generations" that is a "study ol
human behavior." "I personally
affirm that this is the most highly
evolved martial system that I've
ever witnessed, and I've studied
under him for the last four
years."
Since he's been at Stanford,
Shannon has become a Christ
ian, stopped out, and been the
director of a recrdation district in
Monterey county, directing Sol
edad's aquatics program. He is
definitely a free spirit: "I've been
on my own since I was 15," says
Shannon. "I had no promises to
keep."
So Shannon offers his work
shop. He says he will "em
phasize the psychology, not the
needlessly complex mechanical
movements that are required by
the sophisticated martial arts
(karate, judo, etc.). The
mechanics for self-defense are
not complex but are simple in
comparison."
Like the man behind both of
them, both the workshop and the
class promise to be "special." If
you would like to participate in
either or both, contact Shannon
by leaving a note in the "P"
mailbox in Grove House, 584
Mayfield.

ler karate. Their motto is 'one
kick, one kill.' That was Teally a
sophisticated kind of karate. It
was brutal and it was pure com
bat. It wasn't self-defense at all."
This "killer" karate Shannon
describes as employing "about
80 per cent feet. . . mostly using
kicks and sweeps, not so much
the punching hands."
No more involvement
But it was by talking to the
Vietnamese that ' Shannon
realized he didn't want to be in
volved in killing anymore,
whether it was through karate or
through the Air Force.

"I began to re-evaluate my
politics and philosophy about
our whole involvement in the
war. It was something 1 had to
discover on my own. I had every
reason to be gung-ho. When you
have coffee with your best friend
in the morning and a memorial
service in the afternoon, you get
angry. You feel like fighting.
"But insanity depends a lot on
where you are. 1 would have
been considered insane if I'd
been talking about peace over
there. It would have been an act
of treason."
So Shannon was subtle in de
veloping his philosophy of
"treason." "1 began initiating my
own private policy of benign
neglect in my job." He says he
was influenced by the "Buddhis
tic and pacificist attitudes of the
villagers. They were so tranquil
in spite of the tragedies that to
tally swarmed their environ
ment.
"The main point," continues
Shannon, "was that I became
disenchanted with our involve
ment in Vietnam — it became
very clear to me that we had no
business there."
Hong Kong
So Shannon left Vietnam and
went to Hong Kong, where he
encountered more martial ar
tists. "They dumped me on my
rear end and showed me very
quickly that soft hand
techniques were far superior to
these hard feet techniques."
Hong Kong was a source of re
velation for Shannon. He
studied with an old Buddhist
monk who taught him the "soft
system," but taught it to be used
as a "vehicle toward pacifism."
Says Shannon of this
mysterious monk: "He taught
me how to light in order to take
the fight out of me."
After spending almost two

years in Hong Kong, at the end of
1971 Shannon returned to Il
linois. It began to annoy Shan
non how people "talk in
generalities and cliches about it
(the martial arts) in this country.
I thought they were diluting and
perverting the art as I under
stood it. They were making pro
fit off it materially, but were
philosophically barren."
"So," says Shannon, "I came
to California, got accepted to
Stanford, and I met Master
Saito." The rest is history.
'Ninjitsu master'
Saito is a "Ninjitsu master."
Shannon describes Ninjitsu as a
"family art that goes back many
generations" that is a "study ol
human behavior." "I personally
affirm that this is the most highly
evolved martial system that I've
ever witnessed, and I've studied
under him for the last four
years."
Since he's been at Stanford,
Shannon has become a Christ
ian, stopped out, and been the
director of a recrdation district in
Monterey county, directing Sol
edad's aquatics program. He is
definitely a free spirit: "I've been
on my own since I was 15," says
Shannon. "I had no promises to
keep."
So Shannon offers his work
shop. He says he will "em
phasize the psychology, not the
needlessly complex mechanical
movements that are required by
the sophisticated martial arts
(karate, judo, etc.). The
mechanics for self-defense are
not complex but are simple in
comparison."
Like the man behind both of
them, both the workshop and the
class promise to be "special." If
you would like to participate in
either or both, contact Shannon
by leaving a note in the "P"
mailbox in Grove House, 584
Mayfield.

Shannon Phelps is a softspo
ken, gentle, dark-eyed young
man of 28 years who is thinking
of entering the priesthood and
can severely maim or injure if
not actually kill with his bare
hands.
A political science under
graduate, Shannon is a martial
artist of a very special sort, and
he is offering an all-day work
shop to tentatively be held
Saturday, April 2 that will give
him a chance to introduce his art
to the University community. It
will consist of "some presenta
tions and demonstrations and
panel discussions where the au
dience will be invited to partici
pate," says Shannon, and the
speakers will probably include
members of the Palo Alto Police
Department or the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety.
Kick-off
Shannon's "art" is the art of
self-defense, and the workshop
will hopefully serve as a kick-off
for a class to be offered under the
auspices of the Physical Educa
tion Department next quarter
(even though it is not in the new
Time Schedule), entitled "Hu
man Behavior in Self-Defense."
"1 learned the hard way," he
says with a reflective chuckle. "I
learned the importance of self
defense on the street. I fooled
around with karate while I was
in my teens, but it was junk fight
ing really. 1 thought street fight
ing was much superior."
Growing up in South Chicago
he had plenty of opportunities to
experiment with street fighting.
He finds, not too surprisingly,
that this is not something many
Stanford people can relate to. "I
don't talk about it too much be
cause a lot of people around
here, they kind cf look at you and
say 'Gee, you were a hoodlum,
Wow!' What I really learned to

do was/ight the hoodlums." he
says.
After serving as student body
president in a mostly black
•ghetto high school, Shannon left
to join the Air Force. He was 18,
it was 1967, and there was a war
going on. He left for Vietnam.
Green Berets
"I was the intelligence liaison
officer for a Green Beret outfit,"
he says simply. His job was to
"get the Green Berets their air
cover in a fire fight " Although
he explains his role without any
surface emotion, it is obvious
that this is a subject Shannon has
wrestled with for quite a while.
"I have a tremendous amount
of self-reflection on that war that
denies a tremendous amount of
the generalizations made by
both the extremists, the liberals
and the conservatives," he says
firmly. "They use tired cliches
and they really don't understand
the ramifications of the whole
thing. I really felt like it was jus
tified when 1 was there." But
primarily as a result of his intro
duction to Buddhism and his
training in a kind of "killer" ka
rate, he doesn't feel that way
now.
"While I was in the Green Be
rets, 1 was trained in the Korean

evolved martial system that I've
ever witnessed, and I've studied
under him for the last four
years."
Since he's been at Stanford,
Shannon has become a Christ
ian, stopped out, and been the
director of a recrdation district in
Monterey county, directing Sol
edad's aquatics program. He is
definitely a free spirit: "I've been
on my own since I was 15," says
Shannon. "I had no promises to
keep."
So Shannon offers his work
shop. He says he will "em
phasize the psychology, not the
needlessly complex mechanical
movements that are required by
the sophisticated martial arts
(karate, judo, etc.). The
mechanics for self-defense are
not complex but are simple in
comparison."
Like the man behind both of
them, both the workshop and the
class promise to be "special." If
you would like to participate in
either or both, contact Shannon
by leaving a note in the "P"
mailbox in Grove House, 584
Mayfield.

Shannon Phelps is a softspo
ken, gentle, dark-eyed young
man of 28 years who is thinking
of entering the priesthood and
can severely maim or injure if
not actually kill with his bare
hands.
A political science under
graduate, Shannon is a martial
artist of a very special sort, and
he is offering an all-day work
shop to tentatively be held
Saturday, April 2 that will give
him a chance to introduce his art
to the University community. It
will consist of "some presenta
tions and demonstrations and
panel discussions where the au
dience will be invited to partici
pate," says Shannon, and the
speakers will probably include
members of the Palo Alto Police
Department or the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety.
Kick-off
Shannon's "art" is the art of
self-defense, and the workshop
will hopefully serve as a kick-off
for a class to be offered under the
auspices of the Physical Educa
tion Department next quarter
(even though it is not in the new
Time Schedule), entitled "Hu
man Behavior in Self-Defense."
"1 learned the hard way," he
says with a reflective chuckle. "I
learned the importance of self
defense on the street. I fooled
around with karate while I was
in my teens, but it was junk fight
ing really. 1 thought street fight
ing was much superior."
Growing up in South Chicago
he had plenty of opportunities to
experiment with street fighting.
He finds, not too surprisingly,
that this is not something many
Stanford people can relate to. "I
don't talk about it too much be
cause a lot of people around
here, they kind cf look at you and
say 'Gee, you were a hoodlum,
Wow!' What I really learned to

do was/ight the hoodlums." he
says.
After serving as student body
president in a mostly black
•ghetto high school, Shannon left
to join the Air Force. He was 18,
it was 1967, and there was a war
going on. He left for Vietnam.
Green Berets
"I was the intelligence liaison
officer for a Green Beret outfit,"
he says simply. His job was to
"get the Green Berets their air
cover in a fire fight " Although
he explains his role without any
surface emotion, it is obvious
that this is a subject Shannon has
wrestled with for quite a while.
"I have a tremendous amount
of self-reflection on that war that
denies a tremendous amount of
the generalizations made by
both the extremists, the liberals
and the conservatives," he says
firmly. "They use tired cliches
and they really don't understand
the ramifications of the whole
thing. I really felt like it was jus
tified when 1 was there." But
primarily as a result of his intro
duction to Buddhism and his
training in a kind of "killer" ka
rate, he doesn't feel that way
now.
"While I was in the Green Be
rets, 1 was trained in the Korean
style karate, which is really kil
ler karate. Their motto is 'one
kick, one kill.' That was Teally a
sophisticated kind of karate. It
was brutal and it was pure com
bat. It wasn't self-defense at all."
This "killer" karate Shannon
describes as employing "about
80 per cent feet. . . mostly using
kicks and sweeps, not so much
the punching hands."
No more involvement
But it was by talking to the
Vietnamese that ' Shannon
realized he didn't want to be in
volved in killing anymore,
whether it was through karate or
through the Air Force.

"I began to re-evaluate my
politics and philosophy about
our whole involvement in the
war. It was something 1 had to
discover on my own. I had every
reason to be gung-ho. When you
have coffee with your best friend
in the morning and a memorial
service in the afternoon, you get
angry. You feel like fighting.
"But insanity depends a lot on
where you are. 1 would have
been considered insane if I'd
been talking about peace over
there. It would have been an act
of treason."
So Shannon was subtle in de
veloping his philosophy of
"treason." "1 began initiating my
own private policy of benign
neglect in my job." He says he
was influenced by the "Buddhis
tic and pacificist attitudes of the
villagers. They were so tranquil
in spite of the tragedies that to
tally swarmed their environ
ment.
"The main point," continues
Shannon, "was that I became
disenchanted with our involve
ment in Vietnam — it became
very clear to me that we had no
business there."
Hong Kong
So Shannon left Vietnam and
went to Hong Kong, where he
encountered more martial ar
tists. "They dumped me on my
rear end and showed me very
quickly that soft hand
techniques were far superior to
these hard feet techniques."
Hong Kong was a source of re
velation for Shannon. He
studied with an old Buddhist
monk who taught him the "soft
system," but taught it to be used
as a "vehicle toward pacifism."
Says Shannon of this
mysterious monk: "He taught
me how to light in order to take
the fight out of me."
After spending almost two

years in Hong Kong, at the end of
1971 Shannon returned to Il
linois. It began to annoy Shan
non how people "talk in
generalities and cliches about it
(the martial arts) in this country.
I thought they were diluting and
perverting the art as I under
stood it. They were making pro
fit off it materially, but were
philosophically barren."
"So," says Shannon, "I came
to California, got accepted to
Stanford, and I met Master
Saito." The rest is history.
'Ninjitsu master'
Saito is a "Ninjitsu master."
Shannon describes Ninjitsu as a
"family art that goes back many
generations" that is a "study ol
human behavior." "I personally
affirm that this is the most highly
evolved martial system that I've
ever witnessed, and I've studied
under him for the last four
years."
Since he's been at Stanford,

going on. He left for Vietnam.
Green Berets
"I was the intelligence liaison
officer for a Green Beret outfit,"
he says simply. His job was to
"get the Green Berets their air
cover in a fire fight " Although
he explains his role without any
surface emotion, it is obvious
that this is a subject Shannon has
wrestled with for quite a while.
"I have a tremendous amount
of self-reflection on that war that
denies a tremendous amount of
the generalizations made by
both the extremists, the liberals
and the conservatives," he says
firmly. "They use tired cliches
and they really don't understand
the ramifications of the whole
thing. I really felt like it was jus
tified when 1 was there." But
primarily as a result of his intro
duction to Buddhism and his
training in a kind of "killer" ka
rate, he doesn't feel that way
now.
"While I was in the Green Be
rets, 1 was trained in the Korean
style karate, which is really kil
ler karate. Their motto is 'one
kick, one kill.' That was Teally a
sophisticated kind of karate. It
was brutal and it was pure com
bat. It wasn't self-defense at all."
This "killer" karate Shannon
describes as employing "about
80 per cent feet. . . mostly using
kicks and sweeps, not so much
the punching hands."
No more involvement
But it was by talking to the
Vietnamese that ' Shannon
realized he didn't want to be in
volved in killing anymore,
whether it was through karate or
through the Air Force.

"I began to re-evaluate my
politics and philosophy about
our whole involvement in the
war. It was something 1 had to
discover on my own. I had every
reason to be gung-ho. When you
have coffee with your best friend
in the morning and a memorial
service in the afternoon, you get
angry. You feel like fighting.
"But insanity depends a lot on
where you are. 1 would have
been considered insane if I'd
been talking about peace over
there. It would have been an act
of treason."
So Shannon was subtle in de
veloping his philosophy of
"treason." "1 began initiating my
own private policy of benign
neglect in my job." He says he
was influenced by the "Buddhis
tic and pacificist attitudes of the
villagers. They were so tranquil
in spite of the tragedies that to
tally swarmed their environ
ment.
"The main point," continues
Shannon, "was that I became
disenchanted with our involve
ment in Vietnam — it became
very clear to me that we had no
business there."
Hong Kong
So Shannon left Vietnam and
went to Hong Kong, where he
encountered more martial ar
tists. "They dumped me on my
rear end and showed me very
quickly that soft hand
techniques were far superior to
these hard feet techniques."
Hong Kong was a source of re
velation for Shannon. He
studied with an old Buddhist
monk who taught him the "soft
system," but taught it to be used
as a "vehicle toward pacifism."
Says Shannon of this
mysterious monk: "He taught
me how to light in order to take
the fight out of me."
After spending almost two

years in Hong Kong, at the end of
1971 Shannon returned to Il
linois. It began to annoy Shan
non how people "talk in
generalities and cliches about it
(the martial arts) in this country.
I thought they were diluting and
perverting the art as I under
stood it. They were making pro
fit off it materially, but were
philosophically barren."
"So," says Shannon, "I came
to California, got accepted to
Stanford, and I met Master
Saito." The rest is history.
'Ninjitsu master'
Saito is a "Ninjitsu master."
Shannon describes Ninjitsu as a
"family art that goes back many
generations" that is a "study ol
human behavior." "I personally
affirm that this is the most highly
evolved martial system that I've
ever witnessed, and I've studied
under him for the last four
years."
Since he's been at Stanford,
Shannon has become a Christ
ian, stopped out, and been the
director of a recrdation district in
Monterey county, directing Sol
edad's aquatics program. He is
definitely a free spirit: "I've been
on my own since I was 15," says
Shannon. "I had no promises to
keep."
So Shannon offers his work
shop. He says he will "em
phasize the psychology, not the
needlessly complex mechanical
movements that are required by
the sophisticated martial arts
(karate, judo, etc.). The
mechanics for self-defense are
not complex but are simple in
comparison."
Like the man behind both of
them, both the workshop and the
class promise to be "special." If
you would like to participate in
either or both, contact Shannon
by leaving a note in the "P"
mailbox in Grove House, 584
Mayfield.
