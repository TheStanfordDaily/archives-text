Hal's last words as he left to
drive to his secret destination
were not much help. "See you in
the aether," he had said cheerily,
and 1 had laughed. Now he was
waiting for me in the aether and 1
somehow had to find him, no ex
cuses accepted.
As soon as the dark fel 1 be hi nd
my eyes, I saw city streets, gray
water colors of asphalt and con
crete, as though 1 hovered on
some noiseless gliding carpet a
thousand feet over the ground.
But my carpet stopped, and
looking over the side I saw Hal's
car pull to the curb just past an
intersection. "Got him in sight,"
1 said in total fake confidence. It
was a surreal television picture
that I watched in my mind, and
all I had to do was to tell the
machine what this other me was
sending .

Bach's account of the experi
ences in the psychic lab of doctors
Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff.
1 decided to make a trip over to
the Stanford Research Institute
to see what remote viewing was
all about.
Targ and Puthoff are a pair of
young physicists turned
paranormal psychologist

researchers, who have spent
several years investigating tele
pathic communication across
distances. From the shielded re
cesses of their Menlo Park head
quarters, they have observed
viewers receiving messages
from "targets" at Hoover Tower,
the Redwood City Marina, and
top-secret airbases in the South
Pacific.
The remote viewing experi
ments are simple: a target team is
positioned at a secret location

within a two-hundred mile
radius of the SRI lab. The viewer
remains in the lab, and receives
signals from the target team.
From these signals he is able to
construct either verbal or picto
rial descriptions of the scene.
"We have not yet found any
body who does not possess
psychic ability," Targ says. "It's
a universal ability. There are no
psychic superstars."
They have just published a
book called Mind Reach.
