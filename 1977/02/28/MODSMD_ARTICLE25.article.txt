## Trojan subs star in win USC demolishes Cardinals 
### David Georgette 
Los Angeles — The Cards have
hit bottom.
While USC's shooting gave
Stanford a push towards the
basement in the Pacific-8, it was
the Cardinals' poor defense and
shooting that left Stanford on the
wrong end of a 105-84 rout
Saturday afternoon at the Sports
Arena.
"Our defense makes a garbage
dump smell like a perfume fac
tory," said Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso.
The Trojans consistently got
open for good percentage shots
in and around the Card defense
— whether it was man-to-man or
zone.
Largest output
That could be a big reason why
the Trojans, who recorded by
more than 20 points their largest
output in conference play, made
63 per cent of their shots from
the floor, including 70 per cent
in the second half.
"They were moving pretty
well," said USC coach Bob Boyd
of his team. "And the ball was
going down well for us." Six
Trojans ended up scoring in
double figures.
"I said all along that SC is not
as bad as its record," said Di-
Biaso. Meanwhile, the Cards
played worse than their 10-14
mark, including a 39 per cent
shooting average from the field.
Big lead
Leading 44-41 at half, the Tro
jans netted the opening five
points of the second half, and

three minutes into the stanza,
had established a 53-44 advan
tage.
"We thought the first three
minutes of the second half was
when the game got out of con
trol," said Dißiaso. "We had to
play catchup after that."
The Cards did catchup — a lit
tle — an a three-point play by
freshman center Tom Schmal
zried made it 53-48. But then the
roof fell in. The Trojans went on
a six-minute blitz, in which they
outscored Stanford 20-5, to ice
their second conference win of
the year.
The blitz was keyed by two
Trojans who didn't see much ac

tion in Stanford's 68-64 win over
USC in January.
Freshman guard
Don Carfino, a 6-foot-2
freshman who finished the day
with 18 points, hit eight straight
points. Then forward Greg
White, who missed part of the
season because of a foot-injury,
added six straight for USC to put
the contest out of reach.
Carfino had started in place of
the Trojan's second leading
scorer, guard Marv Safford, who
was with his family because of
the death of his sister in a traffic
accident Friday.
The Trojans also were without
the services of another starter,
forward Cleve Porter, who was
out with tonsilitis.
"I don't think the loss (of the
two starters) had as much of an
effect on our team as it did on
Stanford," said Boyd, explain
ing that the Cards could have let
down a bit when it was known
that the Trojan starters would be
out.
'SC had emotion'
"SC played with a great deal of
emotion in overcoming the ad
versity they had," said Dißiaso.
Carfino played with a great
deal of flair, too. He missed only
four of his shots in the game.
"This last week I've never felt
better shooting the ball," he said.
In the first half, another SC
sub, Neil Arnold, paced the Tro
jans. Arnold hit on all five of his
first half shots. "In the first half
they were in a zone and I had a
couple of opportunities," he

said. "I just felt like shooting. I
had a lot of confidence."
Tie score
The Cards, who never led in
the game, deadlocked the Tro
jans for the last time at 28-28 on a
jump shot by kimberly Belton,
who had 10 first half points an<j
18 for the game.
Stanford's Mike Bratz, who
had 12 first half points, finished
with a game-high 22, of which
eight came after USC had gone
up by 20.
"Bratz did a good job of lead
ing the team," said Dißiaso.
But aside from individual per
formances, Dißiaso said, "some
thing's wrong — we've got to
correct it. We played poorly in
our third straight game."
The Cards close out the season
with a pair of games against
California. The Bears come to
Maples for an 8 p.m. contest
Thursday night and Stanford
travels to Harmon Gym Saturdav
night.
The Bears were the hotes.t
team in the conference until
Saturday night when UCLA de
molished Cal 91-69. But the
Bears top two players — Gene
Ransom and Ray Murry got into
foul trouble early in the second
half.
