# Card sprinters shut out SJS
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
San Jose State smashed Stanford Saturday in the
Bay Area Colleges Track and Field Meet, but the
Cardinals laid to rest any talk of theSpartans resur
recting "Speed City" — a name given the Spartan
track team in the mid-1960s when it boasted of
sprinters such as Tommie Smith and Lee Evans.
The Spartans topped the quadrangular competi
tion with 111 points and were followed by Stan
ford with 59, Hayward State 32 and San Francisco
State a point.
But while San Jose's hurdlers, weight men, jum
pers and distance runners demonstrated why the
Spartans hope to challenge for the NCAA crown in
June. Stanford dispelled any notions of a rejuve
nated "Speed City."
'Speed City'
James Lofton, who led the Stanford onslaught
against San Jose's short distance runners, issued
the final rites for "Speed City":
"Headline your story, 'Speed City Moves
North,' " Lofton told writers after the meet. "Let
everyone know Speed City has been relocated at
Stanford."
San Jose posted no wins in the sprints and Stan
ford shut out theSpartans in both relays: it seemed
indeed as if "Speed City" moved its franchise up
the Bayshore to Palo Alto.
"It's a great tribute to be able to beat the sprinters
from San Jose State," Stanford coach Payton Jor
dan said. "I like having our sprinters thinking
there can be a new Speed City. It's easy to knuckle
under to reputations, but we met them head-on
today."
Relay quartet
The Cardinal 440-relay quartet of Marvin
Holmes, Lofton, Cordy Banks and Alan Sheats set
the pace'for Stanford sprinters by upending the
Spartans with a 40.8 circuit of the quarter-mile
oval.
Sheats later blazed to a 47.6 victory in the 440
and Lofton ran to a personal best of 21.0 to win the
220.
Freshmen Banks and Earl Cerfen also ran impre
ssively in the sprints. Banks, in addition to a third

in the 100, ran at Lofton's heels to a 21.1 second
place in the 220. Gerfen came from behind to finish
third in the quarter mile.
While the Spartans finished out of the money in
the sprints they dominated the hurdles.
Hurdles
Defending NCAA titlist Dedy Cooper and team
mate Pete Austin went one-two in the 120 high
hurdles —Cooper scorching the track with a 13.4
performance.
Don Finley edged Stanford's Tom Shellworth in
the 440 intermediates to give San Jose a hurdle
double.
Cooper was disqualified from the intermediates
after jumping to a false start. Dubbed "Superman"
in the San Francisco Examiner Friday, Cooper
also ran the anchor leg of the mile relay. Lofton,
who ran the anchor lap for Stanford, must have
slipped some kryptonite in Cooper's shoes because
he emerged the victor in the battle of the stars.
Sheats, overtaking San Jose's Marl in Rochee on
the third lap, handed Lofton the baton and a five
yard margin.
. r . Lofton
Cooper went right after Lofton and nearly drew
alongside the junior from Los Angeles on the back
stretch. But Lofton began to extend his lead on the
final curve and opened up on the home straighta
way to cross the tape at 3:12.7, eight or nine yards
ahead of Cooper.
The Card sprint crew may have buried Speed
City, but San Jose thrashed Stanford in the distance
and field events.
Lofton won the only field event for the Cards,
breaking his school long jump record of 25-9 3 /4
with a leap of 26-2V2.
The touted matchup between Stanford's Terry
Albritton and San Jose's Ron Semkivv in the shot
put never materialized when Albritton strained
ligaments in his hand while competing Friday
night in the National AAU Championships in New
York (Albritton was runner-up to Mac Wilkins
with a throw of 67-8.).

"It's a great tribute to be able to beat the sprinters
from San Jose State," Stanford coach Payton Jor

there can be a new Speed City. It's easy to knuckle

today."
Relay quartet
The Cardinal 440-relay quartet of Marvin
Holmes, Lofton, Cordy Banks and Alan Sheats set
the pace'for Stanford sprinters by upending the
Spartans with a 40.8 circuit of the quarter-mile
oval.
Sheats later blazed to a 47.6 victory in the 440
and Lofton ran to a personal best of 21.0 to win the
220.
Freshmen Banks and Earl Cerfen also ran impre
ssively in the sprints. Banks, in addition to a third

in the 100, ran at Lofton's heels to a 21.1 second
place in the 220. Gerfen came from behind to finish
third in the quarter mile.
While the Spartans finished out of the money in
the sprints they dominated the hurdles.
Hurdles
Defending NCAA titlist Dedy Cooper and team
mate Pete Austin went one-two in the 120 high
hurdles —Cooper scorching the track with a 13.4
performance.
Don Finley edged Stanford's Tom Shellworth in
the 440 intermediates to give San Jose a hurdle
double.
Cooper was disqualified from the intermediates
after jumping to a false start. Dubbed "Superman"
in the San Francisco Examiner Friday, Cooper
also ran the anchor leg of the mile relay. Lofton,
who ran the anchor lap for Stanford, must have
slipped some kryptonite in Cooper's shoes because
he emerged the victor in the battle of the stars.
Sheats, overtaking San Jose's Marl in Rochee on
the third lap, handed Lofton the baton and a five
yard margin.
. r . Lofton
Cooper went right after Lofton and nearly drew
alongside the junior from Los Angeles on the back
stretch. But Lofton began to extend his lead on the
final curve and opened up on the home straighta
way to cross the tape at 3:12.7, eight or nine yards
ahead of Cooper.
The Card sprint crew may have buried Speed
City, but San Jose thrashed Stanford in the distance
and field events.
Lofton won the only field event for the Cards,
breaking his school long jump record of 25-9 3 /4
with a leap of 26-2V2.
The touted matchup between Stanford's Terry
Albritton and San Jose's Ron Semkivv in the shot
put never materialized when Albritton strained
ligaments in his hand while competing Friday
night in the National AAU Championships in New
York (Albritton was runner-up to Mac Wilkins
with a throw of 67-8.).

Stanford's Alan Sheats takes the baton from Earl Gerfen in a meet last week. Sheats won the 440
with a time of 47.6 and ran on the Card mile relay which turned in a winning time of 3:12.7 in the
Bay Area meet Saturday.
San Jose State smashed Stanford Saturday in the
Bay Area Colleges Track and Field Meet, but the
Cardinals laid to rest any talk of theSpartans resur
recting "Speed City" — a name given the Spartan
track team in the mid-1960s when it boasted of
sprinters such as Tommie Smith and Lee Evans.
The Spartans topped the quadrangular competi
tion with 111 points and were followed by Stan
ford with 59, Hayward State 32 and San Francisco
State a point.
But while San Jose's hurdlers, weight men, jum
pers and distance runners demonstrated why the
Spartans hope to challenge for the NCAA crown in
June. Stanford dispelled any notions of a rejuve
nated "Speed City."
'Speed City'
James Lofton, who led the Stanford onslaught
against San Jose's short distance runners, issued
the final rites for "Speed City":
"Headline your story, 'Speed City Moves
North,' " Lofton told writers after the meet. "Let
everyone know Speed City has been relocated at
Stanford."
San Jose posted no wins in the sprints and Stan
ford shut out theSpartans in both relays: it seemed
indeed as if "Speed City" moved its franchise up
the Bayshore to Palo Alto.
"It's a great tribute to be able to beat the sprinters
