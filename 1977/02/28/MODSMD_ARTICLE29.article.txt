Women's swimming
A strong third-ranked UCLA
women's swim team outscored
National Champions Arizona
State and second ranked Stan
ford to win the Stanford Invita
tional Championships last
weekend. Over the two day affair
UCLA swimmers collected 932
points to ASU's 844 and Stan
ford's 701.
For host Card swimmers, the
fourth annual event served as the
last formal competition ot the
season. Although the majority of
the team had previously qual
ified for the AIAW Nationals (to
be held at Brown University,
March 17-19), the meet served as
a final chance for all swimmers
to break qualifying marks. Stan
ford will now field a deep, al
most complete team, lacking
only in the backstroke events.
"We performed better this
year than last," relates team cap

tain Vicki Hays. "There were
some super swims and this meet
proved that we're really a solid
team."
Not disappointed with a third
place finish, Hays optimistically
states, "We've got another three
weeks to train and taper. 1 think
we're going to do really well in
the Nationals."
Three Stanford freshmen
posted outstanding times over
the weekend. Valerie Lee, an
American record holder in the
200 butterfly, well surpassed the
national qualifying mark in
three events. Her 1650 time of
16:55.804 exceeded a previous
season's swim by almost 20 sec
onds and was over a minute
under the qualifying time. Lee
still trailed behind Arizona
State's Olympian Melissa Belote
at the 1000 but kept strong to
overtake her opponent in the
end. Stanford's Ann Hrodel 1 also

surpassed Belote to come in sec
ond in the 1650.
Lee's time of 4:55.851 in the
500 free led a Stanford sweep of
the event. Teammates Kim
Peyton and Judy Hudson fol
lowed second and third respec
tively.
Stanford's two Olympians
added many points to the Card's
final tally. Australian team
member Judy Hudson won the
400 IM and finished second in
the 200 IM and 200 breast.
Olympic Gold medalist Kim
Peyton captured a 200 free win
and placed third in the 100 free.

Wrestling
Stanford's wrestling team
finished the season with a 26-12
loss to Cal Saturday night in En
cina Gym. The final season re
cord was 11-8, the second high
est percentage of winnings for a
Stanford wrestling team in the
history of the sport at the school.
The Cards forfeited two
weight classes in their loss mak
ing the final outcome of the
match closer than the score indi
cated.
Gary Lynn, wrestling at 167,
almost pinned his man in the
first period and went on to beat
Cal's Ken Schneider, 14-5.

to Oregon State for the Pac-8
tournev.
