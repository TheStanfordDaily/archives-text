# ASSU program fee:
## Who gets the money? 
### Jill Liscom 
The primary source of funds for many of the student
organizations here is the ASSU program fee assessment,
which is collected in the fall.
This year the ASSU distributed the money to 26 organiza
tions, based on recommendations from Financial Manager
Chris Mathe.
The senate has recently been investigating thepossibility
of having the fee assessments made voluntary.
"Although this will probably never happen," said Mathe,
"it would cause a distinct change in how money is given out
around here." Without the assessment money, he added,
the senate would not have money to allocate to student
groups.
The Publications Board received $1000 of the $10,000
assessment, the largest amount of any group. According to
Jeff Stoler, pub board chairman, the money is used "strictly
for allocation to campus newsletters."
Leftover money
Stoler said the pub board has given money to 14 groups
but still has money left over to be used next quarter.
MEChA, theChicanostudent organization, receives $950,
tin! second largest allocation. Mario Vasquez, MEChA trea
surer, explained that most of MEChA's money is divided up
among the eight different groups which MEChA sponsors
to fund their individual projects.
One of these groups, Barrio Assistance, runs a project in
East Palo Alto to tutor chicano students in English.
Some of the money MEChA receives also goes to pay its
operating expenses. In addition, MEChA used some of its
money to sponsor the Bakke rally held here this month.
Money raises money
The program fee also covers the Black Students Union
(BSU). According to BSU president Warner Session, "we
use the money to try to raise more money."
Session said the fee assessment money makes up about
half of BSU's total revenue. The other half is provided by a
big fundraising party held at the beginning of the year.

Other major BSU costs, said Session, included operational
expenses and speakers.
The Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) also
gets a relatively large percentage of the funds, an allocation
of $770. Judy Wellington, SAIO treasurer, said "the money
is somewhat pooled together with money from other
sources."
She said the money is used to pay for speakers, such as
native American poets, and to sponsor related activities in
the community, such as the Education Conference held at
the San Jose Indian Center.
Other major organizations which receive money from the
program fee assessment include the Bridge, Cay People's
Union, Escondido Village Nursery School and the Women's
Center. The ASSU discretionary fund receives $839. Ac
cording to Mathe, this fund is allocated to organizations
that come directly to the senate to request money.
Detrimental effect
Organizations receiving money from the program fee said
losing the money would he detrimental, even though all of
the groups except the pub board have other sources of
funds.
"It would really affect us pretty badly because in order to
raise money, you have to have money," commented Ses
sion. He added that getting more money from outside
sources "wouldn't be impossible, but it would be difficult."
"If we really need money, I'm sure that students would be
able to raise it," said Wellington. "It might hurt them,
though, in that they would be spending too much of their
time seeking off-campus donations."
Vasquez expressed a similar view. "MEChA would still
be operating, but wouldn't be able to do as much. The
members would have to spend more time going off-campus
and getting donations."
According to Stoler, if the program fee assessment did not
pass, the pub board "would not finance newsletters at all.
because there would be no money."

and getting donations."
According to Stoler, if the program fee assessment did not
pass, the pub board "would not finance newsletters at all.
because there would be no money."
The primary source of funds for many of the student
organizations here is the ASSU program fee assessment,
which is collected in the fall.
This year the ASSU distributed the money to 26 organiza
tions, based on recommendations from Financial Manager
Chris Mathe.
The senate has recently been investigating thepossibility
of having the fee assessments made voluntary.
"Although this will probably never happen," said Mathe,
"it would cause a distinct change in how money is given out
around here." Without the assessment money, he added,
the senate would not have money to allocate to student
groups.
The Publications Board received $1000 of the $10,000
assessment, the largest amount of any group. According to
Jeff Stoler, pub board chairman, the money is used "strictly
for allocation to campus newsletters."
Leftover money
Stoler said the pub board has given money to 14 groups
but still has money left over to be used next quarter.
MEChA, theChicanostudent organization, receives $950,
tin! second largest allocation. Mario Vasquez, MEChA trea
surer, explained that most of MEChA's money is divided up
among the eight different groups which MEChA sponsors
to fund their individual projects.
One of these groups, Barrio Assistance, runs a project in
East Palo Alto to tutor chicano students in English.
Some of the money MEChA receives also goes to pay its
operating expenses. In addition, MEChA used some of its
money to sponsor the Bakke rally held here this month.
Money raises money
The program fee also covers the Black Students Union
(BSU). According to BSU president Warner Session, "we
use the money to try to raise more money."
Session said the fee assessment money makes up about
half of BSU's total revenue. The other half is provided by a
big fundraising party held at the beginning of the year.

Other major BSU costs, said Session, included operational
expenses and speakers.
The Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) also
gets a relatively large percentage of the funds, an allocation
of $770. Judy Wellington, SAIO treasurer, said "the money
is somewhat pooled together with money from other
sources."
She said the money is used to pay for speakers, such as
native American poets, and to sponsor related activities in
the community, such as the Education Conference held at
the San Jose Indian Center.
Other major organizations which receive money from the
program fee assessment include the Bridge, Cay People's
Union, Escondido Village Nursery School and the Women's
Center. The ASSU discretionary fund receives $839. Ac
cording to Mathe, this fund is allocated to organizations
that come directly to the senate to request money.
Detrimental effect
Organizations receiving money from the program fee said
losing the money would he detrimental, even though all of
the groups except the pub board have other sources of
funds.
"It would really affect us pretty badly because in order to
raise money, you have to have money," commented Ses
sion. He added that getting more money from outside
sources "wouldn't be impossible, but it would be difficult."
"If we really need money, I'm sure that students would be
able to raise it," said Wellington. "It might hurt them,
though, in that they would be spending too much of their
time seeking off-campus donations."
Vasquez expressed a similar view. "MEChA would still
be operating, but wouldn't be able to do as much. The
members would have to spend more time going off-campus
and getting donations."
