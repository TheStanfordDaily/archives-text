# Maze claims singles crown
## Netters win NorCal tourney 
### Jill Lieber 
Loose as a goose.
That's Hill Maze.
But that's also Ferry Wright,
Saturday the Northern
California Intercollegiate si ngles
finals match was played by two
of the loosest members ol Stan
ford's tennis team.
And that's what made the
match fun to watch.
Maze daze
Junior All-American Hill Maze
defeated junior Perry Wright, 7.(5
(5-0), 6-4. It marked the second
straight year Maze walked off
with the singles crown and the
eighth year in a row that Stan
ford was the team champion.
The Cards accumulated 30
points over the four day period
to runner-up Cal's 21.
"Perry said Dick (Gould)
should have introduced the fi
nals saying, 'In this corner with
the red beard — Perry Wright
and in this corner with the black
beard — Hill Maze,'" Maze
joked after the match.
"God, Perry hit some good
shots. He had three backhands
down the line I just couldn't be
lieve.
'Close matches'
"Perry and 1 have always had
close matches. He's the smartest
guy out there. He was serving
into my body and so I started
topping my return. Then he
didn't know whereto serve me."
Maze just returned from a trip
to England where he and USC
star Bruce Manson were the two
representatives of the United
States junior Davis Cup team in
the British Petroleum Cup Tour
nament.
"With a time lag, Hill got back
about 6 p.m. Tuesday and had to
play two matches Wednesday af
ternoon," coach Gould said. "He
went from playing two solid
weeks indoors on wood to play
ing outside in colder air on a dif
ferent surface. He adjusted well.
That's a tremendous tribute to a
fine competitor."
'Big serve'
"My service is fairly big,"
Maze said. "Serving indoors
helped. I was chipping the
whole tournament this past
week. That's also from coming
right off those slow boards in
England."
Maze's "I don't give a damn
what anybody thinks — 1 just
answer to myself" attitude was
evident in the Nor-Cals as it has
been in the past whenever he

walked onto the courts.
While the other members of
the team adorned their $60
flashy red nylon Adidas sweats,
Maze wore unmatching sweat
pants and pouched hooded
sweat shirt. Last season it was
hard to get "Willie" to part with
his blue ski vest after he finished
warming up for indoor matches.
Saturday as always he started
the first game in his own garb
and then removed the sweats
and let loose on Wright.
'Nervous'
"I was nervous again, when 1
got out on the court," Maze said.
"That helps me because if I'm
not nervous then I'm not ready.
Rod Laver always get nervous.
When I first got out there I felt
kind of shitty but as 1 hit more
and more I felt better and better.
"What really helped me to win
was the breakfast before the
match. Edna (the Zete house
cook) made me a great breakfast

of eggs benedict."
Perry "Mr. Mellow" Wright
said following his singles loss, "I
didn't expect to lose the first set.
I just didn't play likea winneron
the big points. I missed a lot of
forehands and that's usually my
best shot."
Wright redeemed himself in
doubles competition. Teaming
up with frosh Jim Hodges the
two Cards downed Cal's Steve
Hahn and Carlos Aguilar 5-7,
6-3, 6-2 to win the doubles
crown.
Comeback
Wright said losing the first set
spurred them on to win the
.match.
"We just thought we were
going to win easily," he said.
"And they took advantage of it.
"You know, this tournament
was the first time Jim and I have
ever played together. We never

even played together in prac
tice."
That's a good indication of the
competitive drive within the
members of this year's team.
Tennis ladder
What about competition
within the team itself? The big
unanswered question is: who
will be the number one man on
Stanford's ladder this season?
Gould had hoped the Nor-Cal
singles finals would pit Maze
against soph Matt Mitchell.
Mitchell bowed out from the
tourney Thursday due to
stomach flu.
And just what will Maze do if
he is the number two man this
year? Before he could answer
that question, this reporter
flashed another past him.
"Or don't you plan to be
number two?"
He laughed.
"1 sure don't plan to lose."

helped. I was chipping the
whole tournament this past
week. That's also from coming
right off those slow boards in
England."
Maze's "I don't give a damn
what anybody thinks — 1 just
answer to myself" attitude was
evident in the Nor-Cals as it has
been in the past whenever he

walked onto the courts.
While the other members of
the team adorned their $60
flashy red nylon Adidas sweats,
Maze wore unmatching sweat
pants and pouched hooded
sweat shirt. Last season it was
hard to get "Willie" to part with
his blue ski vest after he finished
warming up for indoor matches.
Saturday as always he started
the first game in his own garb
and then removed the sweats
and let loose on Wright.
'Nervous'
"I was nervous again, when 1
got out on the court," Maze said.
"That helps me because if I'm
not nervous then I'm not ready.
Rod Laver always get nervous.
When I first got out there I felt
kind of shitty but as 1 hit more
and more I felt better and better.
"What really helped me to win
was the breakfast before the
match. Edna (the Zete house
cook) made me a great breakfast

of eggs benedict."
Perry "Mr. Mellow" Wright
said following his singles loss, "I
didn't expect to lose the first set.
I just didn't play likea winneron
the big points. I missed a lot of
forehands and that's usually my
best shot."
Wright redeemed himself in
doubles competition. Teaming
up with frosh Jim Hodges the
two Cards downed Cal's Steve
Hahn and Carlos Aguilar 5-7,
6-3, 6-2 to win the doubles
crown.
Comeback
Wright said losing the first set
spurred them on to win the
.match.
"We just thought we were
going to win easily," he said.
"And they took advantage of it.
"You know, this tournament
was the first time Jim and I have
ever played together. We never

even played together in prac
tice."
That's a good indication of the
competitive drive within the
members of this year's team.
Tennis ladder
What about competition
within the team itself? The big
unanswered question is: who
will be the number one man on
Stanford's ladder this season?
Gould had hoped the Nor-Cal
singles finals would pit Maze
against soph Matt Mitchell.
Mitchell bowed out from the
tourney Thursday due to
stomach flu.
And just what will Maze do if
he is the number two man this
year? Before he could answer
that question, this reporter
flashed another past him.
"Or don't you plan to be
number two?"
He laughed.
"1 sure don't plan to lose."

Backhand
Bill Maze returns a backhand Saturday in the NorCal Intercollegiates at Stanford. Maze beat
teammate Perry Wright in the singles competition.
Loose as a goose.
That's Hill Maze.
But that's also Ferry Wright,
Saturday the Northern
California Intercollegiate si ngles
finals match was played by two
of the loosest members ol Stan
ford's tennis team.
And that's what made the
match fun to watch.
Maze daze
Junior All-American Hill Maze
defeated junior Perry Wright, 7.(5
(5-0), 6-4. It marked the second
straight year Maze walked off
with the singles crown and the
eighth year in a row that Stan
ford was the team champion.
The Cards accumulated 30
points over the four day period
to runner-up Cal's 21.
"Perry said Dick (Gould)
should have introduced the fi
nals saying, 'In this corner with
the red beard — Perry Wright
and in this corner with the black
beard — Hill Maze,'" Maze
joked after the match.
"God, Perry hit some good
shots. He had three backhands
down the line I just couldn't be
lieve.
'Close matches'
"Perry and 1 have always had
close matches. He's the smartest
guy out there. He was serving
into my body and so I started
topping my return. Then he
didn't know whereto serve me."
Maze just returned from a trip
to England where he and USC
star Bruce Manson were the two
representatives of the United
States junior Davis Cup team in
the British Petroleum Cup Tour
nament.
"With a time lag, Hill got back
about 6 p.m. Tuesday and had to
play two matches Wednesday af
ternoon," coach Gould said. "He
went from playing two solid
weeks indoors on wood to play
ing outside in colder air on a dif
ferent surface. He adjusted well.
That's a tremendous tribute to a
fine competitor."

"And they took advantage of it.
"You know, this tournament
was the first time Jim and I have
ever played together. We never

even played together in prac
tice."
That's a good indication of the
competitive drive within the
members of this year's team.
Tennis ladder
What about competition
within the team itself? The big
unanswered question is: who
will be the number one man on
Stanford's ladder this season?
Gould had hoped the Nor-Cal
singles finals would pit Maze
against soph Matt Mitchell.
Mitchell bowed out from the
tourney Thursday due to
stomach flu.
And just what will Maze do if
he is the number two man this
year? Before he could answer
that question, this reporter
flashed another past him.
"Or don't you plan to be
number two?"
He laughed.
"1 sure don't plan to lose."

Backhand
Bill Maze returns a backhand Saturday in the NorCal Intercollegiates at Stanford. Maze beat
teammate Perry Wright in the singles competition.
Loose as a goose.
That's Hill Maze.
But that's also Ferry Wright,
Saturday the Northern
California Intercollegiate si ngles
finals match was played by two
of the loosest members ol Stan
ford's tennis team.
And that's what made the
match fun to watch.
Maze daze
Junior All-American Hill Maze
defeated junior Perry Wright, 7.(5
(5-0), 6-4. It marked the second
straight year Maze walked off
with the singles crown and the
eighth year in a row that Stan
ford was the team champion.
The Cards accumulated 30
points over the four day period
to runner-up Cal's 21.
"Perry said Dick (Gould)
should have introduced the fi
nals saying, 'In this corner with
the red beard — Perry Wright
and in this corner with the black
beard — Hill Maze,'" Maze
joked after the match.
"God, Perry hit some good
shots. He had three backhands
down the line I just couldn't be
lieve.
'Close matches'
"Perry and 1 have always had
close matches. He's the smartest
guy out there. He was serving
into my body and so I started
topping my return. Then he
didn't know whereto serve me."
Maze just returned from a trip
to England where he and USC
star Bruce Manson were the two
representatives of the United
States junior Davis Cup team in
the British Petroleum Cup Tour
nament.
"With a time lag, Hill got back
about 6 p.m. Tuesday and had to
play two matches Wednesday af
ternoon," coach Gould said. "He
went from playing two solid
weeks indoors on wood to play
ing outside in colder air on a dif
ferent surface. He adjusted well.
That's a tremendous tribute to a
fine competitor."
'Big serve'
"My service is fairly big,"
Maze said. "Serving indoors
helped. I was chipping the
whole tournament this past
week. That's also from coming
right off those slow boards in
England."
Maze's "I don't give a damn
what anybody thinks — 1 just
answer to myself" attitude was
evident in the Nor-Cals as it has
been in the past whenever he

walked onto the courts.
While the other members of
the team adorned their $60
flashy red nylon Adidas sweats,
Maze wore unmatching sweat
pants and pouched hooded
sweat shirt. Last season it was
hard to get "Willie" to part with
his blue ski vest after he finished
warming up for indoor matches.
Saturday as always he started
the first game in his own garb
and then removed the sweats
and let loose on Wright.
'Nervous'
"I was nervous again, when 1
got out on the court," Maze said.
"That helps me because if I'm
not nervous then I'm not ready.
Rod Laver always get nervous.
When I first got out there I felt
kind of shitty but as 1 hit more
and more I felt better and better.
"What really helped me to win
was the breakfast before the
match. Edna (the Zete house
cook) made me a great breakfast

of eggs benedict."
Perry "Mr. Mellow" Wright
said following his singles loss, "I
didn't expect to lose the first set.
I just didn't play likea winneron
the big points. I missed a lot of
forehands and that's usually my
best shot."
Wright redeemed himself in
doubles competition. Teaming
up with frosh Jim Hodges the
two Cards downed Cal's Steve
Hahn and Carlos Aguilar 5-7,
6-3, 6-2 to win the doubles
crown.
Comeback
Wright said losing the first set
spurred them on to win the
.match.
"We just thought we were
going to win easily," he said.
"And they took advantage of it.
"You know, this tournament
was the first time Jim and I have
ever played together. We never

even played together in prac
tice."
That's a good indication of the
competitive drive within the
members of this year's team.
