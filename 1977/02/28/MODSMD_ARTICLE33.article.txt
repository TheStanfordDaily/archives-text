Vance to investigate China accords
Washington — Secretary ot State Cyrus Vance said yes
terday the administration is checking to determine whether
Henry Kissinger reached any secret understandings with
the People's Republic of China concerning American aban
donment of its ties with Taiwan.
Columnist Joseph Kraft said that President Jimmy Carter
was asked about the alleged understandings in a Feb. 8
meeting with the head of the Chinese liaison mission in
Washington. Huang Chen.
Commenting on the report during an appearance on CBS'
Face (he Nation. Vance said. "YVe are checking to see
whether we have all the papers at the State Department. If
we don't, we will get them."
Kraft said that although there is "no proof" that any
understandings were reached, "it now seems apparent that
President Nixon and Secretary of State Kissinger virtually
promised Peking that they would scrap the Taiwan connec
tion in a couple of years."
Kraft said Carter was unaware of any understandings and
ordered an investigation to ti nd out if there is any documen
tation of them.
Welsh, Scottish home rule bill fails
London — Limited home rule for Scotland and Wales has
suffered a severe, and perhaps fatal blow, raising the ques
tion of how long Prime Minister James Callaghan's Labor
government can stay in power without the support of Scot
tish and Welsh nationalists.
Legislation providing for semi-autonomous assemblies
in Edinburgh and Cardiff was introduced in the House of
Commons last December and was billed as the greatest
constitutional change in centuries.
But last Tuesday night the Devolution Bill — so called
because it would devolve powers to the local assemblies —
came up tor a crucial vote in the House and the government
suffered a stinging defeat.
The government lost by 29 votes, one of the worst Parlia
ment defeats inflicted on a government in recent years.
Mexican protests bring martial law
Juchitan, Mexico — Soldiers and police armed with au

tomatic rifles have been patrolling the streets of this old
Xapotec town, where a protest movement for land has esca
lated into a sometimes hloody battle between authorities
and townspeople.
Last Tuesday police fired on a crowd of about ;i5O people
who marched on the local jail demanding the release of 36
arrested students. Two persons were reported killed and 20
wounded.
Three days later, in a deep ditch six miles from this
southern Mexican town, police found the bodies of three
men who had been among the protesters at the jail. They
were members of a worker-peasant-student coalition that
has pressed Xapotec demands that the government give
them land.
Study: expensive guns used for crime
Washington — A new crime study suggests that crimi
nals use high-priced pistols as often as cheap "Saturday
night specials." The finding may poke holes in the theory
that laws prohibiting inexpensive handguns may go a long
way toward curbing crime.
"Analysis of types of firearms confiscated suggests that
price is not a significant factor in the handguns used for the
commission of crimes," the report said. "The data indicate
that expensive handguns are used as often as inexpensive
ones."
The analysis was contained in the report released yester
day by the Police Foundation.
The foundation is a private nonprofit organization which
promotes research on police issues.

Welsh, Scottish home rule bill fails
London — Limited home rule for Scotland and Wales has
suffered a severe, and perhaps fatal blow, raising the ques
tion of how long Prime Minister James Callaghan's Labor
government can stay in power without the support of Scot
tish and Welsh nationalists.
Legislation providing for semi-autonomous assemblies
in Edinburgh and Cardiff was introduced in the House of
Commons last December and was billed as the greatest
constitutional change in centuries.
But last Tuesday night the Devolution Bill — so called
because it would devolve powers to the local assemblies —
came up tor a crucial vote in the House and the government
suffered a stinging defeat.
The government lost by 29 votes, one of the worst Parlia
ment defeats inflicted on a government in recent years.
Mexican protests bring martial law
Juchitan, Mexico — Soldiers and police armed with au

tomatic rifles have been patrolling the streets of this old
Xapotec town, where a protest movement for land has esca
lated into a sometimes hloody battle between authorities
and townspeople.
Last Tuesday police fired on a crowd of about ;i5O people
who marched on the local jail demanding the release of 36
arrested students. Two persons were reported killed and 20
wounded.
Three days later, in a deep ditch six miles from this
southern Mexican town, police found the bodies of three
men who had been among the protesters at the jail. They
were members of a worker-peasant-student coalition that
has pressed Xapotec demands that the government give
them land.
Study: expensive guns used for crime
Washington — A new crime study suggests that crimi
nals use high-priced pistols as often as cheap "Saturday
night specials." The finding may poke holes in the theory
that laws prohibiting inexpensive handguns may go a long
way toward curbing crime.
"Analysis of types of firearms confiscated suggests that
price is not a significant factor in the handguns used for the
commission of crimes," the report said. "The data indicate
that expensive handguns are used as often as inexpensive
ones."
The analysis was contained in the report released yester
day by the Police Foundation.
The foundation is a private nonprofit organization which
promotes research on police issues.
