# Americans to meet at Entebbe
## Amin postpones meeting

Nairobi, Kenya (AP) â€” President Idi
Amin postponed his meeting with
Americans living in Uganda yester
day, rescheduling it for Wednesday at
the Entebbe Airport, the scene of last
luly's raid by Israeli commandos.
And amid signs that Amin planned
some sort of spectacular gathering at
the airport Wednesday, Radio Uganda
warned that the United Staies should
not mount a raid similar to the Israelis'.
In Washington, President )immy
Carter said the United States was
monitoring the Ugandan situation
closely, trying not to upset President
Amin, and trying to take advantage of
his good wishes that he has expressed.
U.N. offers
"We've had offers from the U.N. to
intercede, but we've handled our af
fairs through the German embassy,
and so far there's nothing to cause
deep concern," Carter told reporters
while visiting his daughter-in-law at
Bethesda Naval Hospital.
"In the event of any invasion, the
invading force will be disintegrated by
the Ugandan armed forces," the radio
said, quoting a "military spokesman"
generally considered to be Amin.
I'he "spokesman" urged Ugandans
to be alert for signs that might indicate
an invasion and said that because of
the Israeli raid, the presence of U.S.
naval vessels off the coast of Kenya in
the Indian Ocean "must be taken seri
ously." '
Delay
Amin was to have met tomorrow in
the capital city of Kampala with the
Americans believed living in Uganda.
Ugandan radio said the meeting was
delayed until 8 a.m. Wednesday at
nearby Entebbe because the Ameri
cans, mostly missionaries in outlying
areas, had asked for more time to pre
pare for the gathering.
In what appeared to be another
Ugandan effort to defuse American
alarm, the radio said earlier yesterday

that Amin wanted to thank the mis
sionaries for their work and planned to
award special medals to some of the
Americans.
The radio said the meeting had been
moved from Kamapala to the lounge of
the airport at nearby Entebbe on Lake
Victoria "because it is the only one in
Uganda large enough to accommodate
the 3000 people who will attend the
meeting."

There was no explanation of why
3000 people would attend the 8 a.m.
meeting or who they would be.
Amin held a meeting with all British
citizens after London cut its diploma
tic ties to Uganda last August. He as
sured the Britons they were welcome
to stay in Uganda if they behaved
themselves and there has been specu
lation some such message might be the
point of the meeting with Americans.
