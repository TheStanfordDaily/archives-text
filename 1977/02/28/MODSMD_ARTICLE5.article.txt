# Clark urges support for blacks in S. Africa
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The United States should support
majority rule in southern Africa and
try to bring about a change throughout
the region by diplomatic and
economic pressure on South Africa,
U.S. Sen. Richard Clark (D-Iowa) said
in a speech here Friday.
Clark is chairman of the Subcommit
tee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee.
"We should say to the South Afri
cans, 'You should know ... if you con
tinue your ways (of racism and oppres
sion) our policies toward you will be of
isolation,' " Clark said.
He said he thought the policy would
work because "I don't believe they
(South African leaders) think they can
go it alone. I think they believe their
last hope in the world is the United
States."
Majority rule throughout southern
Africa depends on South African
cooperation, said Clark, but if the
white oppressive regime of South Af
rican Prime Minister John Vorster does
not respond to isolation, the United
States should takea "so be it" attitude.
Clark consistently argued against

military involvement during his talk,
urging "active involvement" in a
peaceful solution to the problem.
Yet in comments after the talk and
the subsequent panel discussion,
Clark refused to ruleout the possibility
of armed intervention by the United
States.
"Nothing is out of the question," he
said.
However, the situation in the area
would have to change drastically be
fore armed intervention would be seri
ously considered, he said.
"I think in the reality of what is apt
to happen in South Africa, our inter
vention militarily, overtly or covertly,
would not benefit us or them," Clark
said.
Clark said one major problem in the
region is to prevent a power transfer
from one "oppressive rascism to
another type of oppressive racism." He
said the United States wishes to help
institute a situation of equal opportun
ity for everyone, regardless of race.
Clark said the hostility of African
nations toward the United States dur
ing the Nixon and Ford administra
tions has mellowed into an attitude of
hope with the election of President
Jimmy Carter.
Following the talk, a panel of three
African experts from the University
community commented on Clark's
remarks. The panel members were St.
Clair Drake, professor emeritus of an
thropology; Pius Ngwandu, a Ph.D.
candidate in'education and a Tanza
nian citizen; and Lewis Cann, senior
fellow and deputy curator of the Afri
can collection at the Hoover Institu
tion. Assoc. Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy was the discussion
moderator.
Drake said he did not agree with any
of the past U.S. policy directions re
garding Africa. He said he was distres

sed to hear Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance say he would cut off funds to
some oppressive regimes but not all.
Noting that funds to an unstrategi
cally important nation such as
Ethiopia were to be cut off, he said,
"Why can't South Africa be added to
the list tomorrow?"
No matter what is required, "the
U.S. should support the right of people
to have rights," he said, including
armed intervention if necessary. He
said such a move would be in keeping
with our history and traditions.
Ngwandu called America's ideals
"lofty" but said they must be trans
lated into positive actions. He said
many Africans believe America is the
sort of nation which might turn indi

vidual freedom into oppression of the
people. This view came to he widely
held during the Nixon years when
support for black Africa waned, he
said.
Gann said white rule has made
southern Africa much more indus
trialized and given it a much better
standard of living than the black Afri
can nations. He attributed the differ
ence to "European initiative," saying
many of the black African nations have
more resource wealth than the coun
tries ruled by whites, but don't use this
wealth.

held during the Nixon years when
support for black Africa waned, he
said.
Gann said white rule has made
southern Africa much more indus
trialized and given it a much better
standard of living than the black Afri
can nations. He attributed the differ
ence to "European initiative," saying
many of the black African nations have
more resource wealth than the coun
tries ruled by whites, but don't use this
wealth.

The United States should support
majority rule in southern Africa and
try to bring about a change throughout
the region by diplomatic and
economic pressure on South Africa,
U.S. Sen. Richard Clark (D-Iowa) said
in a speech here Friday.
Clark is chairman of the Subcommit
tee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee.
"We should say to the South Afri
cans, 'You should know ... if you con
tinue your ways (of racism and oppres
sion) our policies toward you will be of
isolation,' " Clark said.
He said he thought the policy would
work because "I don't believe they
(South African leaders) think they can
go it alone. I think they believe their
last hope in the world is the United
States."
Majority rule throughout southern
Africa depends on South African
cooperation, said Clark, but if the
white oppressive regime of South Af
rican Prime Minister John Vorster does
not respond to isolation, the United
States should takea "so be it" attitude.
Clark consistently argued against

military involvement during his talk,
urging "active involvement" in a
peaceful solution to the problem.
Yet in comments after the talk and
the subsequent panel discussion,
Clark refused to ruleout the possibility
of armed intervention by the United
States.
"Nothing is out of the question," he
said.
However, the situation in the area
would have to change drastically be
fore armed intervention would be seri
ously considered, he said.
"I think in the reality of what is apt
to happen in South Africa, our inter
vention militarily, overtly or covertly,
would not benefit us or them," Clark
said.
Clark said one major problem in the
region is to prevent a power transfer
from one "oppressive rascism to
another type of oppressive racism." He
said the United States wishes to help
institute a situation of equal opportun
ity for everyone, regardless of race.
Clark said the hostility of African
nations toward the United States dur
ing the Nixon and Ford administra
tions has mellowed into an attitude of
hope with the election of President
Jimmy Carter.
Following the talk, a panel of three
African experts from the University
community commented on Clark's
remarks. The panel members were St.
Clair Drake, professor emeritus of an
thropology; Pius Ngwandu, a Ph.D.
candidate in'education and a Tanza
nian citizen; and Lewis Cann, senior
fellow and deputy curator of the Afri
can collection at the Hoover Institu
tion. Assoc. Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy was the discussion
moderator.
Drake said he did not agree with any
of the past U.S. policy directions re
garding Africa. He said he was distres

sed to hear Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance say he would cut off funds to
some oppressive regimes but not all.
Noting that funds to an unstrategi
cally important nation such as
Ethiopia were to be cut off, he said,
"Why can't South Africa be added to
the list tomorrow?"
No matter what is required, "the
U.S. should support the right of people
to have rights," he said, including
armed intervention if necessary. He
said such a move would be in keeping
with our history and traditions.
Ngwandu called America's ideals
"lofty" but said they must be trans
lated into positive actions. He said
many Africans believe America is the
sort of nation which might turn indi

vidual freedom into oppression of the
people. This view came to he widely
held during the Nixon years when
support for black Africa waned, he
said.
Gann said white rule has made
