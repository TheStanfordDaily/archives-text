The United States should support
majority rule in southern Africa and
try to bring about a change throughout
the region by diplomatic and
economic pressure on South Africa,
U.S. Sen. Richard Clark (D-Iowa) said
in a speech here Friday.
Clark is chairman of the Subcommit
tee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee.
"We should say to the South Afri
cans, 'You should know ... if you con
tinue your ways (of racism and oppres
sion) our policies toward you will be of
isolation,' " Clark said.
He said he thought the policy would
work because "I don't believe they
(South African leaders) think they can
go it alone. I think they believe their
last hope in the world is the United
States."
Majority rule throughout southern
Africa depends on South African
cooperation, said Clark, but if the
white oppressive regime of South Af
rican Prime Minister John Vorster does
not respond to isolation, the United
States should takea "so be it" attitude.
Clark consistently argued against

military involvement during his talk,
urging "active involvement" in a
peaceful solution to the problem.
Yet in comments after the talk and
the subsequent panel discussion,
Clark refused to ruleout the possibility
of armed intervention by the United
States.
"Nothing is out of the question," he
said.
However, the situation in the area
would have to change drastically be
fore armed intervention would be seri
ously considered, he said.
"I think in the reality of what is apt
to happen in South Africa, our inter
vention militarily, overtly or covertly,
would not benefit us or them," Clark
said.
Clark said one major problem in the
region is to prevent a power transfer
from one "oppressive rascism to
another type of oppressive racism." He
said the United States wishes to help
institute a situation of equal opportun
ity for everyone, regardless of race.
Clark said the hostility of African
nations toward the United States dur
