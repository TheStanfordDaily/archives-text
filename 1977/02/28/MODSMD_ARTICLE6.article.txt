# Dollies dance, grin and bear it
## 
### Kathy Tucker (Last of a three-part series) 
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
—Charles Dickens
A Tale of Two Cities
Dollies, it seems, must have the patience of Job. Look
what happened to them when they accompanied the Band
to Oregon — land of liquid sunshine, Ken Kesey, Rainier
Beer and Duck basketball.
Some of the boys at Eugene's McArthur Court kept wav
ing dollar bills at them.
"How would you like to have men standing up in the
stands and waving money at you every time you turned
around?" said Carla Murray, who suffered the taunts along
with her fellow Dollies.
Well, how would you like it?
If you're a Dolly, you grin and bear it. .
It's all part of the Dolly "routine," which must be put up
with as a matter of course. You could say that it's just part of
the experience, but I can't emphasize enough that there is
no collective Dolly "experience."
Murray, Lynne Preslo, Carrie Teagle, kathy Pelton and
Heidi Jacobson are all individuals. Each has "experienced"
the Dollies just as you and I experience Stanford.
Changed perceptions
Once a woman has become a Dolly, nobody perceives her
in quite the same light again. It is as though the cir
cumstances of her existence here have changed.
And in fact they have.

"Each of us has gone through a number of changes,"
Murray said. Relationships with boyfriends have to be rede
fined and you have to be on the iookout for the guy who
wants a date "just because she's a Dolly."
"I've had people come up to me and say, 'Are you a
sophomore? I've never seen you around here before,' " said
Murray, who is a senior. "I thought a lot of people were
asking me for a date because I was a Dolly."
And that can be hard for a boyfriend to accept. "At that
time (when she first decided to try out) 1 don't think he was
very excited about having me go out," Murray said. "We
had some adjustments to go through. We might still be
going through them."
Brett Logan, Murray's boyfriend, agrees.
"It's been tough," he said. "I had to share her with a lot of
other commitments and a lot of other people. I didn't really
want to."
But Logan added that he felt he and Murray have been
able to "expand their relationship" during the year.
Different role
"I could play another role with her that I hadn't played
before," he said, noting that before she became a Dolly, he
had been the dominant partner — "the leader" — in the
relationship.
"Now she is doing something and I can lend her sup
port," he said. "I am glad now that she tried out," he said.
Murray said that the other four dollies had similar ad
justments to make.
But she added that the good times far outnumbered the
bad.
"1 think that physically, if we could do it all over again,
we would," Murray said. "But 1 think that we are glad that
this year is coming to an end. Our bones are aching and our
muscles are tired. We're not mannequins and we've kept the
friends we had before. But we all feel that this year has been
a success."
(Kathy Tucker is a sophomore who currently resides in
Cedro House, Wilbur Hull. Today she will he among 75
women who will try out for the Dollies. She has
written about her experiences while she was trying out:
"I wanted to write this series of articles because I felt that
the Stanford community wanted to know more about the '
Dollies and Dolly try outs than can he discerned from
watching them at football and basketball games."
"I asked to remain anonymous for the first two articles
because people I know are trying out for the Dollies, too.
The other reason is that I didn't want to jeopardize the
storv.")

"I've had people come up to me and say, 'Are you a
sophomore? I've never seen you around here before,' " said
Murray, who is a senior. "I thought a lot of people were
asking me for a date because I was a Dolly."
And that can be hard for a boyfriend to accept. "At that
time (when she first decided to try out) 1 don't think he was
very excited about having me go out," Murray said. "We
had some adjustments to go through. We might still be
going through them."
Brett Logan, Murray's boyfriend, agrees.
"It's been tough," he said. "I had to share her with a lot of
other commitments and a lot of other people. I didn't really
want to."
But Logan added that he felt he and Murray have been
able to "expand their relationship" during the year.
Different role
"I could play another role with her that I hadn't played
before," he said, noting that before she became a Dolly, he
had been the dominant partner — "the leader" — in the
relationship.
"Now she is doing something and I can lend her sup
port," he said. "I am glad now that she tried out," he said.
Murray said that the other four dollies had similar ad
justments to make.
But she added that the good times far outnumbered the
bad.
"1 think that physically, if we could do it all over again,
we would," Murray said. "But 1 think that we are glad that
this year is coming to an end. Our bones are aching and our
muscles are tired. We're not mannequins and we've kept the
friends we had before. But we all feel that this year has been
a success."

A Tale of Two Cities
Dollies, it seems, must have the patience of Job. Look
what happened to them when they accompanied the Band
to Oregon — land of liquid sunshine, Ken Kesey, Rainier
Beer and Duck basketball.
Some of the boys at Eugene's McArthur Court kept wav
ing dollar bills at them.
"How would you like to have men standing up in the
stands and waving money at you every time you turned
around?" said Carla Murray, who suffered the taunts along
with her fellow Dollies.
Well, how would you like it?
If you're a Dolly, you grin and bear it. .
It's all part of the Dolly "routine," which must be put up
with as a matter of course. You could say that it's just part of
the experience, but I can't emphasize enough that there is
no collective Dolly "experience."
Murray, Lynne Preslo, Carrie Teagle, kathy Pelton and
Heidi Jacobson are all individuals. Each has "experienced"
the Dollies just as you and I experience Stanford.
Changed perceptions
Once a woman has become a Dolly, nobody perceives her
in quite the same light again. It is as though the cir
cumstances of her existence here have changed.
And in fact they have.

"Each of us has gone through a number of changes,"
Murray said. Relationships with boyfriends have to be rede
fined and you have to be on the iookout for the guy who
wants a date "just because she's a Dolly."
