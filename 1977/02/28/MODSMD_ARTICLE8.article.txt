## Editorial Guest professor board 
### 
When the ASSU Senate meets tonight to con
sider a new method of choosing members for the
Guest Professorship Board, we urge it to make all
five members students appointed by the ASSU
Nominations Committee.
The board is now structured to have two stu
dent members appointed by the senate and three
members from SWOPSI, SCIRE and ARLO.
Before the board invites a person to Stanford, it
should consult SWOPSI, SCIRE and ARLO just
as it consults any other academic department to
insure the guest professor will be sponsored.
However, we see no reason why these three or
ganizations have an inherent right over any
other department to participate in the selection
of the professor.
Representatives from the general student body
should choose the guest professor since it is the
general student body who will be paying the fee
assessment and taking the class.
We feel the Nominations Committee rather
than the senate is the best student group to ap
point the board members. The committee has
more time to interview candidates than the
senators. The senate participates in the final
selection process anyway, since it must approve
all Nomination Committee nominees.

Regarding the guest professorship program as
a whole, we feel its purpose is to bring someone
to Stanford whom the University would be pre
vented from hiring due to University or de
partmental budgetary or policy constraints. The
guest should have special expertise which
would enable him or her to teach courses not
currently offered here.
This is the program's primary purpose. If the
board knows of a politically persecuted person
in a foreign country who can offer an innovative
insight into an academic area, then the board
should invite him or her.
However, the purpose of the program as it
stands now is not solely to provide asylum for
political prisoners. Students pay their money for
a "guest professor" and a person who has the
qualifications to be a professor who can teach
something not currently offered here is what the
students should receive.
If an organization wants to ask students to
support political dissidents, then it should ask
students for an "International Justice" fee as
sessment. Students should not be deceived into
giving money to organizations which do not do
what their title indicates.
