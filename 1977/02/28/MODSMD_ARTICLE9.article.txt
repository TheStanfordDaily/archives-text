# Graduate orientation needed
## 
### 
Most graduate students know very little about the wide
array of University resources outside of their own depart
ments. Ignorance of campus affairs is by no means a
monopoly of the graduate community, but the style and
content of graduate education exaggerates the problem.
The emphasis of graduate programs is on academic ac
complishment, with little encouragement to communicate
and socialize with others from different disciplines. The
administrative autonomy of each graduate department sets
a framework within which graduate students live and work
in isolation from general campus activities.
