# Stevens protesters occupy Encina office
## 
### Jim Tranquada, Martin Kernberg Bonny Rodden 
Almost 60 students occupied the of
fice waiting room of Robert Au
gsburger, vice president for business
and finance, for more than an hour and
a half yesterday evening, leaving only
after being threatened with arrest.
The demonstrators voted, 16 to 12,
to leave Augsburger's Encina Hall of
fice 15 minutes after Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington ordered
them from the building.
Members and supporters of the Stan
ford Committee for justice at J.P. Ste
vens occupied the waiting room just
before 5 p.m.
A supporter of the Committee for
justice and Stanford graduate, Larry
Litvak said the immediate provocation
for the sit-in was that Augsburger was
"irresponsible" in abstaining on the
J.P. Stevens disclosure resolution and
"irresponsive" in walking out on the
Committee for Justice meeting with
him.
At 5:45 Herrington told de
monstrators they would be allowed to
stay until 6 p.m., when Encina offi
cially closes. "But after that point,
we'll take action," he said.
Action means arrest
Asked what that action might be, he
said, "arrest." He said charges against
the demonstrators would be primarily
"trespassing and refusing to leave."
Demonstrators then requested a time
extension to consider their alterna
tives. Herrington agreed to let de
monstrators stay until 6:10 p.m., say
ing he would wait to hear from ad
ministrators before enforcing the
deadline. At 6:10 p.m., Herrington or
dered that no one, except office
employes, be allowed to enter the
building.
Herrington said later than 10 police
were on the scene, with 10 en route
and 10 on standby.
It was nearly 6 p.m. when Peter
Necarsulmer, a member of the Com

mittee for Justice, reached Augsburger
by telephone. He told Augsburger of
the 6:10 p.m. deadline and the threat of
arrest, tfien asked him to respond to a
list of four demands.
Demands
The demonstrators demanded that
Stanford revoke its abstention, that an
official who could revoke the absten
tion meet with them, that the Univer
sity agree to hold a public forum to
discuss corporate investment respon
sibility, and that no demonstrators be
prosecuted.
Interviewed later when at home,
Augsburger said he did not see any
reason to reconsider his vote. He said
he had already met with the de
monstrators, and he had no say in
whether they were prosecuted or not.
He said the public forum "seemed like
a reasonable request, and probably a
desirable one," and he agreed to dis
cuss the matter with the Stevens com
mittee.
Necarsulmer told the vice president
the protesters decided to occupy the
office because "your position and the
University's wasn't resolved satisfac
torily."
One demonstrator who identified

himself us a law student discussed the
legal standing of the group and gave
out the telephone number of Jeannie
Eichner, a legal para professional with
Palo' Alto's Homines and Eichner law
firm.
Contacted later, Eichner said three
local law firms, and up to a dozen
lawyers were available for the defense
of the protestors should they be ar
rested.
As demonstrators continued discus
sing whether to stay and risk arrest,
boxes of fruit, bread, jam and cheese
arrived in anticipation of a protracted
stay.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, arrived at the scene
at 6:10 p.m., munching an ice cream
cone. Asked for a statement, he said he
didn't even know anyone was in the
waiting room. Rosenzweig later read
the University's official Policy on
Campus Disruption.
No time extension
Immediately afterward, Herrington
announced the time would not be ex
tended. Provost William Miller
phoned Herrington and asked him to
make the announcement. Stating he
was merely performing his duty as a

police officer, he said, "All I'm asking
you to do is move out of the building.
That's a legal requirement."
Demonstrators then debated for
about 15 minutes whether to stay and
risk arrest.
Senior Seth Foldy said it was a ques
tion of "individual choice" and added
violating the law would "amplify our
convictions."
Sophomore Steve Hansrh urged the
group not to leave. "Augsburger has
gotten by by completely ignoring us,"
he said.
Necarsulmer said, "We have taken
this issue as far as we can. ... I don't

see how anyone's purposes will be
served by getting arrested."
Vote
Finally, at 6:30 p.m. Foldy
suggested a vote be taken, asking t hose
firmly committed to either leaving or
staying to abstain. The remainder of
the group, willing to accept the bind
ing decision of the majority, voted lh
to 12 to leave.
The protestors many of whom left
clapping arm in arm, were greeted
with applause by about 100 students
who had gathered outside Encina.
Some had been summoned by runners
sent by the protesters to dorms and
Row houses to solicit additional sup
port.
Following chants of "We will win!"
ind "We will be back!" Necarsulmer
eviewed events of the afternoon for
the group gathered on the steps of En
cina.
"We will stand out here and be
proud and continue to fight until jus
tice is obtained," he said. He em
phasized a future target of protest was
to be the University's investments in
corporations who invest in South Af
rica.
Herrington noted afterward the de
cision to leave was "a wise decision;
issues are not decided or aided by this
kind of action."
Provost Miller, who made the final
decision to evict the demonstrators,
had house guests and was not availa
ble for comment.

Safety Marvin Herrington ordered
them from the building.
Members and supporters of the Stan
ford Committee for justice at J.P. Ste
vens occupied the waiting room just
before 5 p.m.
A supporter of the Committee for
justice and Stanford graduate, Larry
Litvak said the immediate provocation
for the sit-in was that Augsburger was
"irresponsible" in abstaining on the
J.P. Stevens disclosure resolution and
"irresponsive" in walking out on the
Committee for Justice meeting with
him.
At 5:45 Herrington told de
monstrators they would be allowed to
stay until 6 p.m., when Encina offi
cially closes. "But after that point,
we'll take action," he said.
Action means arrest
Asked what that action might be, he
said, "arrest." He said charges against
the demonstrators would be primarily
"trespassing and refusing to leave."
Demonstrators then requested a time
extension to consider their alterna
tives. Herrington agreed to let de
monstrators stay until 6:10 p.m., say
ing he would wait to hear from ad
ministrators before enforcing the
deadline. At 6:10 p.m., Herrington or
dered that no one, except office
employes, be allowed to enter the
building.
Herrington said later than 10 police
were on the scene, with 10 en route
and 10 on standby.
It was nearly 6 p.m. when Peter
Necarsulmer, a member of the Com

mittee for Justice, reached Augsburger
by telephone. He told Augsburger of
the 6:10 p.m. deadline and the threat of
arrest, tfien asked him to respond to a
list of four demands.
Demands
The demonstrators demanded that
Stanford revoke its abstention, that an
official who could revoke the absten
tion meet with them, that the Univer
sity agree to hold a public forum to
discuss corporate investment respon
sibility, and that no demonstrators be
prosecuted.
Interviewed later when at home,
Augsburger said he did not see any
reason to reconsider his vote. He said
he had already met with the de
monstrators, and he had no say in
whether they were prosecuted or not.
He said the public forum "seemed like
a reasonable request, and probably a
desirable one," and he agreed to dis
cuss the matter with the Stevens com
mittee.
Necarsulmer told the vice president
the protesters decided to occupy the
office because "your position and the
University's wasn't resolved satisfac
torily."
One demonstrator who identified

himself us a law student discussed the
legal standing of the group and gave
out the telephone number of Jeannie
Eichner, a legal para professional with
Palo' Alto's Homines and Eichner law
firm.
Contacted later, Eichner said three
local law firms, and up to a dozen
lawyers were available for the defense
of the protestors should they be ar
rested.
As demonstrators continued discus
sing whether to stay and risk arrest,
boxes of fruit, bread, jam and cheese
arrived in anticipation of a protracted
stay.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, arrived at the scene
at 6:10 p.m., munching an ice cream
cone. Asked for a statement, he said he
didn't even know anyone was in the
waiting room. Rosenzweig later read
the University's official Policy on
Campus Disruption.
No time extension
Immediately afterward, Herrington
announced the time would not be ex
tended. Provost William Miller
phoned Herrington and asked him to
make the announcement. Stating he
was merely performing his duty as a

police officer, he said, "All I'm asking
you to do is move out of the building.
That's a legal requirement."
Demonstrators then debated for
about 15 minutes whether to stay and
risk arrest.
Senior Seth Foldy said it was a ques
tion of "individual choice" and added
violating the law would "amplify our
convictions."
Sophomore Steve Hansrh urged the
group not to leave. "Augsburger has
gotten by by completely ignoring us,"
he said.
Necarsulmer said, "We have taken
this issue as far as we can. ... I don't

see how anyone's purposes will be
served by getting arrested."
Vote
Finally, at 6:30 p.m. Foldy
suggested a vote be taken, asking t hose
firmly committed to either leaving or
staying to abstain. The remainder of
the group, willing to accept the bind
ing decision of the majority, voted lh
to 12 to leave.
The protestors many of whom left
clapping arm in arm, were greeted
with applause by about 100 students
who had gathered outside Encina.
Some had been summoned by runners
sent by the protesters to dorms and
Row houses to solicit additional sup
port.
Following chants of "We will win!"
ind "We will be back!" Necarsulmer
eviewed events of the afternoon for
the group gathered on the steps of En
cina.
"We will stand out here and be
proud and continue to fight until jus
tice is obtained," he said. He em
phasized a future target of protest was
to be the University's investments in
corporations who invest in South Af
rica.
Herrington noted afterward the de
cision to leave was "a wise decision;
issues are not decided or aided by this
kind of action."
Provost Miller, who made the final
decision to evict the demonstrators,
had house guests and was not availa

Almost 60 students occupied the of

J.P. Stevens disclosure resolution and
"irresponsive" in walking out on the
Committee for Justice meeting with
him.
At 5:45 Herrington told de
monstrators they would be allowed to
stay until 6 p.m., when Encina offi
cially closes. "But after that point,
we'll take action," he said.
Action means arrest
Asked what that action might be, he
said, "arrest." He said charges against
the demonstrators would be primarily
"trespassing and refusing to leave."
Demonstrators then requested a time
extension to consider their alterna
tives. Herrington agreed to let de
monstrators stay until 6:10 p.m., say
ing he would wait to hear from ad
ministrators before enforcing the
deadline. At 6:10 p.m., Herrington or
dered that no one, except office
employes, be allowed to enter the
building.
Herrington said later than 10 police
were on the scene, with 10 en route
and 10 on standby.
It was nearly 6 p.m. when Peter
Necarsulmer, a member of the Com

mittee for Justice, reached Augsburger
by telephone. He told Augsburger of
the 6:10 p.m. deadline and the threat of
arrest, tfien asked him to respond to a
list of four demands.
Demands
The demonstrators demanded that
Stanford revoke its abstention, that an
official who could revoke the absten
tion meet with them, that the Univer
sity agree to hold a public forum to
discuss corporate investment respon
sibility, and that no demonstrators be
prosecuted.
Interviewed later when at home,
Augsburger said he did not see any
reason to reconsider his vote. He said
he had already met with the de
monstrators, and he had no say in
whether they were prosecuted or not.
He said the public forum "seemed like
a reasonable request, and probably a
desirable one," and he agreed to dis
cuss the matter with the Stevens com
mittee.
Necarsulmer told the vice president
the protesters decided to occupy the
office because "your position and the
University's wasn't resolved satisfac
torily."
One demonstrator who identified

himself us a law student discussed the
legal standing of the group and gave
out the telephone number of Jeannie
Eichner, a legal para professional with
Palo' Alto's Homines and Eichner law
firm.
Contacted later, Eichner said three
local law firms, and up to a dozen
lawyers were available for the defense
of the protestors should they be ar
rested.
As demonstrators continued discus
sing whether to stay and risk arrest,
boxes of fruit, bread, jam and cheese
arrived in anticipation of a protracted
stay.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, arrived at the scene
at 6:10 p.m., munching an ice cream
cone. Asked for a statement, he said he
didn't even know anyone was in the
waiting room. Rosenzweig later read
the University's official Policy on
Campus Disruption.
No time extension
Immediately afterward, Herrington
announced the time would not be ex
tended. Provost William Miller
phoned Herrington and asked him to
make the announcement. Stating he
was merely performing his duty as a

police officer, he said, "All I'm asking
you to do is move out of the building.
That's a legal requirement."
Demonstrators then debated for
about 15 minutes whether to stay and
risk arrest.
Senior Seth Foldy said it was a ques
tion of "individual choice" and added
violating the law would "amplify our
convictions."
Sophomore Steve Hansrh urged the
group not to leave. "Augsburger has
gotten by by completely ignoring us,"
he said.
Necarsulmer said, "We have taken
this issue as far as we can. ... I don't

see how anyone's purposes will be
served by getting arrested."
Vote
Finally, at 6:30 p.m. Foldy
suggested a vote be taken, asking t hose
firmly committed to either leaving or
staying to abstain. The remainder of
the group, willing to accept the bind
ing decision of the majority, voted lh
to 12 to leave.
The protestors many of whom left
clapping arm in arm, were greeted
with applause by about 100 students
who had gathered outside Encina.
Some had been summoned by runners
sent by the protesters to dorms and
Row houses to solicit additional sup
port.
Following chants of "We will win!"
ind "We will be back!" Necarsulmer
eviewed events of the afternoon for
the group gathered on the steps of En
cina.
"We will stand out here and be
proud and continue to fight until jus
tice is obtained," he said. He em
phasized a future target of protest was
to be the University's investments in
corporations who invest in South Af
rica.
Herrington noted afterward the de
cision to leave was "a wise decision;
issues are not decided or aided by this
kind of action."
Provost Miller, who made the final
decision to evict the demonstrators,
had house guests and was not availa
ble for comment.
Almost 60 students occupied the of
fice waiting room of Robert Au
gsburger, vice president for business
and finance, for more than an hour and
a half yesterday evening, leaving only
after being threatened with arrest.
The demonstrators voted, 16 to 12,
to leave Augsburger's Encina Hall of
fice 15 minutes after Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington ordered
them from the building.
Members and supporters of the Stan
ford Committee for justice at J.P. Ste
vens occupied the waiting room just
before 5 p.m.
A supporter of the Committee for
justice and Stanford graduate, Larry
Litvak said the immediate provocation
for the sit-in was that Augsburger was
"irresponsible" in abstaining on the
J.P. Stevens disclosure resolution and
"irresponsive" in walking out on the
