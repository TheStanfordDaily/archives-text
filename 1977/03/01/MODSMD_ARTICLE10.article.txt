# Getting down to business

Most Stanford students have had
enough experience with student gov
ernment in high school to know that
it's a joke. Right? Apparently the vari
ous offices we filled were intended
only to measure our popularity and get
us into prestigious colleges.
The principal of my high school
liked to describe student government
types as "the cream of the cream of the

crop," implying that the character of a
school's students was best judged by
those elected to represent their in
terests. Despite this grand title, we
didn't take the responsibilities of our
offices seriously.
Bake sales flopped and posters

didn't get painted but it didn't ruin
anyone's life. So as long as the prom
was a success, everything was cool.
The stakes are just a tiny bit higher in
college, however, and we should treat
student government accordingly.
Tiny voices
Of course, no student government,
regardless of how fired-up it is about
doing something, can be expected to
accomplish very much. No one on the
Board of Trustees or in Building 10 is
ever going to allow the ASSU Senate or
Council of Presidents (COP) to make a
decision of any great importance. This
is understandable and perhaps even
justified.
Transients are never al lowed a major
voice in the policy-making procedures
of any community, even the most
democratic. Compared to the lifetimes
devoted to Stanford and the academic
world by professors and adminis
trators, our stay of four years here
seems very short.
A vested interest
But even transients have a right to be
heard, especially when they invest
$25,000 of their parents' money in an

institution. The administrators and fa
culty members, decent individuals on
the whole, are usually willing to at
least listen to student proposals. They
are, of course, under no obligation to
follow up our suggestions with action.
Ideally, the ASSU Senate and COP
should serve as the instrument
through which the opinions of the
largest segment of the Stanford stu
dent body are expressed. These opin
ions should be reasonable and
eloquently presented since the amount
of influence we as students have upon
the decision makers is directly propor
tional to the good judgement exhibited
in making the suggestions. The recent
resolution concerning the foreign lan
guage requirement is a good example
of a student government exerting
maximum influence.
Humor is an important aspect of col
lege life. When you are confronted
constantly by books, libraries and
examinations, laughter becomes a
minor miracle and those who promote
it heroes. Usually.
Cut the comedy
The ASSU Senate is not an approp
riate forum for comedy routines such
as the massage parlor resolution. It
boils down to this: we can have a stu
dent government which is at least lis
tened to by those who determine uni
versity policy, or we can have a troupe
of entertainers, snickered at by all and
respected by none.
Ultimately the best way to assure
that student opinion is considered be
fore policy decisions are made is to
have a student representative on the
Board of Trustees. Hut there is abso
lutely no reason why that most august
of bodies should admit one of us to its
ranks if our student leaders, "the
cream of the cream of the crop," do not
take their duties seriously. This isn't
high school any longer. If students tol
erate comedy from our Senators, we
have no reason to complain if our in
terests are ignored by the University.

The principal of my high school
liked to describe student government
types as "the cream of the cream of the

crop," implying that the character of a
school's students was best judged by
those elected to represent their in
terests. Despite this grand title, we
didn't take the responsibilities of our
offices seriously.
Bake sales flopped and posters

didn't get painted but it didn't ruin
anyone's life. So as long as the prom
was a success, everything was cool.
The stakes are just a tiny bit higher in
college, however, and we should treat
student government accordingly.
Tiny voices
Of course, no student government,
regardless of how fired-up it is about
doing something, can be expected to
accomplish very much. No one on the
Board of Trustees or in Building 10 is
ever going to allow the ASSU Senate or
Council of Presidents (COP) to make a
decision of any great importance. This
is understandable and perhaps even
justified.
Transients are never al lowed a major
voice in the policy-making procedures
of any community, even the most
democratic. Compared to the lifetimes
devoted to Stanford and the academic
world by professors and adminis
trators, our stay of four years here
seems very short.
A vested interest
But even transients have a right to be
heard, especially when they invest
$25,000 of their parents' money in an

institution. The administrators and fa
culty members, decent individuals on
the whole, are usually willing to at
least listen to student proposals. They
are, of course, under no obligation to
follow up our suggestions with action.
Ideally, the ASSU Senate and COP
should serve as the instrument
through which the opinions of the
largest segment of the Stanford stu
dent body are expressed. These opin
ions should be reasonable and
eloquently presented since the amount
of influence we as students have upon
the decision makers is directly propor
tional to the good judgement exhibited
in making the suggestions. The recent
resolution concerning the foreign lan
guage requirement is a good example
of a student government exerting
maximum influence.
Humor is an important aspect of col
lege life. When you are confronted
constantly by books, libraries and
examinations, laughter becomes a
minor miracle and those who promote
it heroes. Usually.
Cut the comedy
The ASSU Senate is not an approp
riate forum for comedy routines such
as the massage parlor resolution. It
boils down to this: we can have a stu
dent government which is at least lis
tened to by those who determine uni
versity policy, or we can have a troupe
of entertainers, snickered at by all and
respected by none.
Ultimately the best way to assure
that student opinion is considered be
fore policy decisions are made is to
have a student representative on the
Board of Trustees. Hut there is abso
lutely no reason why that most august
of bodies should admit one of us to its
ranks if our student leaders, "the
cream of the cream of the crop," do not
take their duties seriously. This isn't
high school any longer. If students tol
erate comedy from our Senators, we
have no reason to complain if our in
terests are ignored by the University.

Most Stanford students have had
enough experience with student gov
ernment in high school to know that
it's a joke. Right? Apparently the vari
ous offices we filled were intended
only to measure our popularity and get
us into prestigious colleges.
