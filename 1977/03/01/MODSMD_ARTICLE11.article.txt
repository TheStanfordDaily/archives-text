# Fewer poor pupils in school
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The
number of school children
below the poverty level dropped
by 569,000 across the nation in
the first half of the decade, but
the South accounted for more
than that total and the number
actually rose in other areas.
The Census Bureau said 7.1:3
million children of school age
lived in 1975 in households with
incomes below the federal pov
erty level of $5500 for a nonfarm
family of four.
That was a drop of about
569,000, or 7.4 per cent, from
1970.
In the South, the number liv
ing in poverty was 3.1 million in
1975, a drop of about 718 000
from five years earlier. But the
percentage of the region's school
children living in poverty, at
19.6 per cent, was still above the
national rate of 14.5 per cent.
In the Northeast, the school
child poverty population was up
8 3,000 or 6.7 per cent; in the
North Central region, it was up
38,000, or 2.4 per cent, and in the
West it was up 29,000, or 2.6 per
cent.
The figures were contained in
a state-by-state breakdown put

together by Census and the De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW) at Congress's
direction. The count was to help
Congress decide whether to
overhaul the formulas used to
compute distribution of $1.65
billion of federal money used
annually to support educational
programs for the poor and dis
advantaged.
Any change in the formulas
would have to be made by Con
gress. But in a hypothetical
computation performed by HEW
on the basis of the population
changes only, the South would
lose $89 million to the North
east, North Central and West.
The regional breakdowns,
which were the first since the
1970 census, broadly show
computations based on annual
poverty censuses. The data
could become part of a continu
ing struggle over how much in
federal funds are distributed to
various regions.
The Northeast and North
Central states have contended
that they have been discrimi
nated against to the benefit of the
faster-growing South and West.
For 1975 the median family

income in the nation was
$13,719. It was $12,236 in the
South; $14,3 16 in the West;
$14,481 in the Northeast and
$14,541 in the North Central sec
tion.
And the school-age survey
showed that the South, with 32
per cent of the total population,
still is home to 43.4 per cent of
all school children living in
poverty.
