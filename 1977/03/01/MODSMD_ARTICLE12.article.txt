# Hospitals to cut use of tranquilizers
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — State
health officials are putting new
restrictions on the use of power
ful tranquilizers at state hospi
tals, including the screening of
all dosages by a committee.
Recent reports of abuse at the
11 mental hospitals have in
cluded allegations of overdrug
ging, a complaint also common
at nursing homes. Patients'-
rights groups, in addition, have
accused the hospitals of forced
drugging.
The new rules will be imposed
first at Metropolitan State Hospi
tal in Norwalk, the state's
largest. They are aimed at con
trolling and monitoring doses of
high-powered tranqu ili/.ers,
used frequently on mental pa
tients.
A chief designer of the regula
tions, Dr. William Keating, a top
aide to state Health Director
Jerome Lackner, said drugs too
often are used as the only treat
ment in the mental hospitals.
"Medication is not an end in
itself," he said. "It helps restore
contact, but then you should
move on. It's been like the Brave

New World — take a pill for ev
erything."
The new standards include:
—Having a five-member
committee review unusually
large doses and establish strict
standards for doses, particularly
to children and the elderly.
—Giving drugs in packaged
individual doses instead of mass
dispensing from large contain
ers.
—Ending the practice of dis
pensing drugs to hospital aides
in wholesale amounts, to be ad
ministered "as needed."
—Prescribing no more than
one tranquilizer per patient at a
time except in extreme cases,
which must be approved by the
hospital committee and a state
Health Department panel.
As many as four or five diffe
rent tranquilizers have been pre
scribed at one time for the same
patient. Keating said.
He said the Southern Califor
nia Psychiatric Society ap
proved the regulations in prin
ciple but objected to restrictions
on the individual judgment of
prescribing doctors.
