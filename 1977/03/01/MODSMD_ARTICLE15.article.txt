Based 011 the bonk Voyage of the Damned by

viewed at the |WA Screening Room. San Fran
cisco, February 21, 1977.
Voyage of the Damned is
another attempt at a big budget
feature with a Big Name cast
doing a film with a social con
science. It doesn't quite work.
Faye Dunaway, Malcolm
McDowell, Orson Welles, Lee
Grant, Max Von Sydow, Oskar
Werner, James Mason, Katherine
Ross, and Ben Gazzara (to name a
few) are run through their parts
without really getting a chance
to show their full potential. The
characters they portray, for the
most part, are hack stereotypes
we've all seen too many times

before.
For instance, katherine Ross
does the Whore With the Heart of
Gold, Malcolm McDowell does
the Lovestruck Youth, and Faye
Dunaway does her vast array of
facial twitchings as the unloved,
unfulfilled professor's wife.
The story itself is a good one; it
just lacks proper execution. The
film is based on the historical ac
count of 900 Jewish refugees
who were allowed to leave Ger
many aboard a cruise ship in
1939, as part of a Nazi prop
aganda ploy. The ship is bound
for Havana.
However, what the passengers
aren't told is that Guba will not
let them land. Neither will any
one else.
During the voyage we learn
that the Nazis are using this in

cident, not only to show the rest
of the world their good inten
tions concerning the Jews, but
also to land a Gestapo agent in
Havana.
The failing in execution
comes from the film spreading
itself too thin. There are too
many characters that we are
shown "in depth." There is just
too little time in one film to make
every character appear as a major
one.
I suppose what bothered me
the most about Voyage of the
Damned is that it could have
been a great film. The potential
for drama, suspense, and in
teraction are all there, but some
how it consistently falls short of

its goal.
A glaring example of this fail
ure is a suicide scene in which a
man slits his wrists and jumps
overboard into the Havana har
bor. The timing is off by seconds.
We see too many reaction
shots of his fellow passengers
without knowing what is hap
pening to him in the water. If two
or three shots could have been
trimmed from the scene, it could
have rivaled Hitchcock. To
further defuse the drama, we
later learn the man survived the
attempt.
If you want to kill some time,
this might be a good film to
watch. But with so many great
ones around, I'd spend my
money elsewhere.

Suicide
Havana police rescue Sam Wanamaker (center), who has attempted suicide, in Voyage of the
Damned. This would-be epic suspense film, starring Faye Dunaway, Orson Welles, and Max Von
Sydow, falls short in recreating the true-life drama of an incident in which 900 German refugees
were stranded at sea.
