## 'Crucible' smooth 
### 
Arthur Miller's TheCrucibJeis
so heavy that any company per
forming it risks coming off either
boring or corny.
Luckily, Trancos House a
voided both extremes with last
weekend's generally smooth,
though uneven, production.
Directed by Joan Trusty, the
show started slowly, then built
to a strong third-act climax. Tim
ing was sharp throughout, espe
cially in the scenes between
Abigail Williams (Cathy Fager)
and John Proctor (Carl Chamber
lin). Only a few scenes, like
Elizabeth Proctor's arrest in Act
2, seemed disjointed or off
balance.
The all-freshman cast handled
the demanding script well.
Cathy Fager's Abigail Wil
liams was the production's most
clearly defined character. She
brought out not only vengeful
bitterness but also cunning
cruelty in the amoral girl who
encourages her friends to cry
"Witch!"
Though his shortness some
times interfered with his credi
bility, Carl Chamberlin's John
Proctor anchored the show.
Whenever he was onstage, he
controlled the acting and kept
the scenes together.
Loryn Burgess' Mary Warren
and Susan Faye's Elizabeth Proc

tor were popular with the audi
ence, but the real favorites were
Cina Favela (Tituba) and Ted
Gardenswartz (Giles Corey),
who made the most of juicy
character parts.
In choosing The Crucible.
Trancos tackled a difficult,
through frequently-attempted
play which can be both engros
sing drama, and hard-hitting so
cial commentary.
The play views the Salem
witch trials as an intense
intellectual-emotional puzzle,
which entangles the guilty and
the innocent alike: Abigail Wil
liams and her girlfriends cap
riciously condemn a village to
ruin — John Proctor and his fol
lowers try to prove the witch
hunt is a fraud — and the au
thorities of church and state are
so obsessed with protecting
Good that they breed Evil.
Miller wrote The Crucible to
condemn the McCarthy Red
Scare hearings of the 19505, in
which the American govern
ment hunted Communists.
Much of the play's dialogue
and most of its themes are easily
translated from 1692, Salem, to
1954, Washington, D.C. In both
cases. Miller saw mass hysteria
manipulated to benefit those in
power.
