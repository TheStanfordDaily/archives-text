## Beethoven performance anemic 
### 
Wednesday night's perfor
mance of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony by the San Francisco
Symphony, although for the
most part technically accurate,
suffered from a lack of spirit and
enthusiasm. The orchestra
sounded anemic.
Beethoven's Ninth is a com
pletely unified work, yet its
composition was spread over
much of Beethoven's later
career. In 1793, Beethoven first
attempted to set Schiller's poem,
the "Ode to Joy" to music. This
poem, although never consi
dered by critics to be one of
Schiller's best, attracted Beeth
oven because of its message of
universal brotherhood.
Joy, O daughter of Elysium
Thy pure magic frees all
others
Held in Customs' rigid rings,
Men throughout the world are
brothers
In the haven of thy wings.
Eventually this poem became
the text for the Choral Finale of
the Ninth Symphony.
The theme of the Scherzo was
written down in 1815. Later,

during the composition of the
Missa Solemnis, Beethoven
worked on the first movement.
By 1822 the first movement was
completed and the symphony
had started to coalesce. Only
weeks before its first perfor
mance in 1824, Beethoven was
still unsure of his decision to in
clude a choral final movement.
'Only innovation'
The introduction of the chorus
to the final movement was not
Beethoven's only innovation in
the form of the Ninth Symphony.
Reversing the customary order,
he put the Scherzo immediately
after the first movement, so that
the Adagio movement preceded
the Choral Finale.
The finale would have been
remarkable for its form alone,
even without the introduction of
the chorus and soloists. Previ
ously the four movements of a
symphony were completely in
dividual entities, each with its
own distinct theme. In the
Ninth, Beethoven unites themes
from all the movements in the
introduction to the Choral
Finale.

In the symphony's perfor
mance, balance problems were
apparent in the first movement.
The violin section of the sym
phony is seldom overpowering,
yet in this instance they covered
up many important wind solos.
Throughout the program the vio
lin section's tone was harsh and
their attacks were sloppy.
While the Scherzo was
brought to life by Barry Jerkows
ky's driving timpani solos, the
depth and feeling of the Adagio
movement, considered one of
the most beautiful Beethoven
ever wrote, was not fully
realized in this performance; the
members of the orchestra were
obviously not devoting their full
concentration to the music.
However, the fourth horn solo of
the third movement, written by
Beethoven at the request of a
horn player in a Viennese or
chestra, was well executed by
Jeremy Merrill.
Chorus highlight
The last movement was high
lighted by the chorus, under the
excellent direction of Louis
Magor. They sang with the

urgency and excitement that the
orchestra lacked. Ihe four sol
oists were situated between the
chorus and the orchestra, mak
ing them an integral part of the
ensemble.
The opening baritone solo
serves as the link between the
purely orchestral music and the
chorus, but as sung by Douglas
Lawrence, it lacked assertive
ness and depth. Frank Little,
tenor, making his debut with the
San Francisco Symphony,
clearly had a case of opening
night jitters. His entrance and
solos were shaky and uneven.
Leona Mitchell dominated the
quartet with her soaring tone
quality, continually overpower
ing the mezzo-soprano, Nina
Hinson.
Edo de Waart's direction was
controlled, but at times almost
too restrained. While the
changes de Waart made in the
brass seating corrected some ba
lance problems, others were still
very evident, particularly bet
ween winds and strings. Al
though de Waart himself ap
peared intensely involved on the
podium, his enthusiasm failed to
take hold of the musicians.
The obvious disinterest
of the orchestra members made it
impossible for the performance
to fulfill the audience's expecta
tion. It is unfortunate that the
San Francisco Symphony, given
Beethoven's music and all the
fine musicians located in the Bay
Area, could not unite its forces
into a better than mediocre per
formance.
The all-Beethoven concert
opened with the Incidental
Music to Egmont. Composed in
1810, the overture and inciden
tal music were written for
Goethe's play, Egmont.
Beethoven held Goethe in
high regard and was particularly
fascinated by this play in which
the hero, Count Egmont, sac
rifices his life to defend the free
dom of the Netherlands from
repression by the Spanish
Monarchy. The struggle for lib
erty is a theme common to many
of Beethoven's works including
his only opera, Fidelio.
The overture, four entr'actes,
and two songs for the heroine,
sung by soprano Leona Michell,
were performed competently but
without great feeling. While the
Incidental Music was played
with no great flaws, it was clear
that the orchestra and the audi
ence were looking past Egmont
in anticipation of Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony.
Next Wednesday Edo de
Waart will be conducting the
Symphony in Brown's Cross
Sections and Color Fields,
Haydn's Symphony 88 and
Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto
No. 3.
