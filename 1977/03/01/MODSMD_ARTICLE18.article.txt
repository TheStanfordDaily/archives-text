## Audience confronted in Egan's 'Marat/Sade' 
### 
The Stanford Drama department performs Peter
Weiss's Marat-Sade with all the intensity, lewd
ness, anxiety and absurdity that the German
playwright intended. Peter Weiss stands as one of
the foremost European playwrights since World
War II; his powerful Marat/Sade, written in 1964,
has earned much international controversy, ex
tending beyond its political implications.
Weiss created a play within a play — the director
of the Charenton Asylum invites the audience to
participate in the recreation of Jean-Paul Marat's
death, as seen through the eyes of the Marquis de
Sade. As well as supervising the play, de Sade
serves to counter and belittle Marat's idealistic
attempts to further the effects of the French Re
volution and bring freedom to the insane and polit
ical prisoners of the Asylum.
The many level sof the play reflect t his search for
freedom. On one level the need for freedom is
manifested by the incredible gyrations and per
verse movements of the patients, who are scattered
about on the steps of the stage. Each patient has
developed a fixation, an obsession with his hands,
or movements that cannot fail to startle and en
trance the audience. The dances and songs of a
group of four patients, played by David Bryant,
Peggy Nisbet, Marshall Watson and Malcolm
Young, especially stand out and create an intense
alliance with the audience.
The fervor and anxiety of the patients is offset by
the coolness of the Marquis de Sade, played by
Larry Friedlander. Friedlander injects elements of
alientation as he portrays the hard cynicism and
detachment of de Sade, who finds his freedom in
individuality.

Friedlander's dignified, deliberate movements
illustrate very well de Sade's scorn for the re
volutionary ideas of Marat. However, Friedlan
der's voice, due to a recent attack of laryngitis,
sometimes misses the intensity of the philosophi
cal insinuations he must deliver.
Jamie Reid excellently portrays the confusion
and idealism of the radical Jean-Paul Marat. As
Reid sits in his bathtub soaking his wounds, he
eloquently fends off and suffers through the scorns
of Marat and the indecisions of his delirium. De
spite these pressures, Marat is a symbol of his
conviction that "the important thing is to pull
yourself up by your own hair, to turn yourself
inside out and see the whole world with fresh
eyes."
Duperret, played by Joseph Siravo, and Char
lotte Corday, played by Carole Bunker, look for
change on yet another level. Siravo plays his
lecherous role of an erotomaniac with penetrating
debauchery; he is constantly confronting Corday
with his demands for sexual release.
Bunker's anguish and dreamlike state are con
vincingly played, and she persistently cries for an
end to violence and a freedom to bring harmony
and peace into her world.
Robert Egan has not directed a play that is
merely entertaining and enjoyable. In fact, its au
sterity and intellectual discourses appeal to the
intellect rather than to the emotions. By using a
purely functional stage and directing his charac
ters in imaginative, sometimes fervent, stage
movements, he creates a play that confronts the
audience's consciousness.
Marat/Sade is playing in theSceneShop of Mem
Aud from tonight through Saturday of this week.

Sade. As well as supervising the play, de Sade
serves to counter and belittle Marat's idealistic
attempts to further the effects of the French Re
volution and bring freedom to the insane and polit
ical prisoners of the Asylum.
The many level sof the play reflect t his search for
freedom. On one level the need for freedom is
manifested by the incredible gyrations and per
verse movements of the patients, who are scattered
about on the steps of the stage. Each patient has
developed a fixation, an obsession with his hands,
or movements that cannot fail to startle and en
trance the audience. The dances and songs of a
group of four patients, played by David Bryant,
Peggy Nisbet, Marshall Watson and Malcolm
Young, especially stand out and create an intense
alliance with the audience.
The fervor and anxiety of the patients is offset by
the coolness of the Marquis de Sade, played by
Larry Friedlander. Friedlander injects elements of
alientation as he portrays the hard cynicism and
detachment of de Sade, who finds his freedom in
individuality.

Friedlander's dignified, deliberate movements
illustrate very well de Sade's scorn for the re
volutionary ideas of Marat. However, Friedlan
der's voice, due to a recent attack of laryngitis,
sometimes misses the intensity of the philosophi
cal insinuations he must deliver.
Jamie Reid excellently portrays the confusion
and idealism of the radical Jean-Paul Marat. As
Reid sits in his bathtub soaking his wounds, he
eloquently fends off and suffers through the scorns
of Marat and the indecisions of his delirium. De
spite these pressures, Marat is a symbol of his
conviction that "the important thing is to pull
yourself up by your own hair, to turn yourself
inside out and see the whole world with fresh
eyes."
Duperret, played by Joseph Siravo, and Char
lotte Corday, played by Carole Bunker, look for
change on yet another level. Siravo plays his
lecherous role of an erotomaniac with penetrating
debauchery; he is constantly confronting Corday
with his demands for sexual release.
Bunker's anguish and dreamlike state are con
vincingly played, and she persistently cries for an
end to violence and a freedom to bring harmony
and peace into her world.
Robert Egan has not directed a play that is
merely entertaining and enjoyable. In fact, its au
sterity and intellectual discourses appeal to the
intellect rather than to the emotions. By using a
purely functional stage and directing his charac
ters in imaginative, sometimes fervent, stage
movements, he creates a play that confronts the
audience's consciousness.
Marat/Sade is playing in theSceneShop of Mem

The Stanford Drama department performs Peter
Weiss's Marat-Sade with all the intensity, lewd
ness, anxiety and absurdity that the German
playwright intended. Peter Weiss stands as one of
the foremost European playwrights since World
War II; his powerful Marat/Sade, written in 1964,
has earned much international controversy, ex
tending beyond its political implications.
Weiss created a play within a play — the director
of the Charenton Asylum invites the audience to
participate in the recreation of Jean-Paul Marat's
death, as seen through the eyes of the Marquis de
Sade. As well as supervising the play, de Sade
serves to counter and belittle Marat's idealistic
attempts to further the effects of the French Re
volution and bring freedom to the insane and polit
ical prisoners of the Asylum.
