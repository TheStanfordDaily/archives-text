# Scientists debate state DNA bill
## 
### Mark Schleiss News analysis 
Scientists here are waiting to see
whether the state or federal legisla
tures will propose regulatory DNA
legislation which would affect genetic
research at the University.
Currently a proposal is before the
state assembly which would strictly
regulate recombinant DNA research at
nearly a dozen campuses in California
and for any private companies en

gaged in the work.
Presently all federally funded in
stitutions, including the University,
are subject to guidelines set up last
year by the National Institute of Health
(NIH). The state proposal would give
the California Health Department au
thority to enforce much tougher regu
lations than the NIH guidelines pro
vide for.
According to Ken Wagstaff, chair
man of the state Health Department, a
bill will probably be presented on the
floor of the assembly by next week.
"We hope to have d hill ready to pre
sent by next week," Wagstaff said. "Al
though it is too early to say what
exactly its contents will be, it won't
differ a great deal from Lappe's origi
nal proposal."

Biology Prof. Allen Campbell,
chairman of the administrative panel
here on recombinant DNA research,
said he was not certain how a state bill
to regulate research would affect Stan
ford.
"I have not seen the text of any prop
osal," Campbell said. "If a bill is pas
sed, it will impose stricter regulations
on our research, but that's all I know so
far."
Disagreement exists among profes
sors here over whether NIH regula
tions need be changed at all. David
Clayton, associate professor of pathol
ogy and a scientist involved in DNA
research, said he felt NIH guidelines
sufficiently covered any dangers that
could arise in research.
'Best job possible'
Clayton pointed out that the NIH
guidelines are "as strict or stricter"
than the guidelines for handling
dangerous organisms like anthrax or
botulism. The fact that no serious ac
cident has occurred with these or
ganisms in the past few years is proof,
Clayton said, that the NIH guidelines
for DNA are safe.
Clayton said he supported federal
review of the guidelines, but was
against state regulation.
Dr. Halsted Holman, professor of
immunology at the Medical School,
said he found the NIH guidelines in
sufficient in two aspects.
'Could colonize'
"The provisions do not require a
monitoring of the workers involved in
the DNA research," Holman said. "The
organisms could colonize in the work
ers and leave the laboratory, posing
possible dangers of infection.

"The other deficiency is the lack of a
requirement of full knowledge (about
the DNA material) on the part of the
worker. The guidelines hint that he
should he fully knowledgeable about
what he's working with, but they don't
emphasize this enough."
Holman said these two factors
prompted the Cambridge, Mass. city
council to approve a three-month
moratorium last year on DNA research
at Harvard.
Although Palo Alto has no apparent
plans to limit University genetic ex
periments. the basic question of
whether DNA research should be done
at all is being debated.
Public meeting
At last month's DNA public meeting
at the Medical Center, Biochemistry
Prof. David Hogness minimized the
dangers DNA research could pose to
society.
"As far as anyone knows," Hogness

said, "to date nobody has been hurt"
by recombinant DNA research. Fears
about disasters in this area, he said, are
"not based on fact; they're based on
imagined scenarios."
At the same meeting Holman called
attention to possible dangers of con
ducting recombinant research close to
hospitals. Holman called for an
examination of the juxtaposition of
low-immunity population and DNA
research.
One campus group, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), favors a com
plete moratorium on recombinant
DNA research. "Until the public can be
educated about DNA," ARC member
David Thorn said, "no decision about
the necessity of research can be made."
Vice President of Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said he felt the fed
eral government would ultimately set
the guidelines for DNA research.

dangerous organisms like anthrax or
botulism. The fact that no serious ac
cident has occurred with these or
ganisms in the past few years is proof,
Clayton said, that the NIH guidelines
for DNA are safe.
Clayton said he supported federal
review of the guidelines, but was
against state regulation.
Dr. Halsted Holman, professor of
immunology at the Medical School,
said he found the NIH guidelines in
sufficient in two aspects.
'Could colonize'
"The provisions do not require a
monitoring of the workers involved in
the DNA research," Holman said. "The
organisms could colonize in the work
ers and leave the laboratory, posing
possible dangers of infection.

"The other deficiency is the lack of a
requirement of full knowledge (about
the DNA material) on the part of the
worker. The guidelines hint that he
should he fully knowledgeable about
what he's working with, but they don't
emphasize this enough."
Holman said these two factors
prompted the Cambridge, Mass. city
council to approve a three-month
moratorium last year on DNA research
at Harvard.
Although Palo Alto has no apparent
plans to limit University genetic ex
periments. the basic question of
whether DNA research should be done
at all is being debated.
Public meeting
At last month's DNA public meeting
at the Medical Center, Biochemistry
Prof. David Hogness minimized the
dangers DNA research could pose to
society.
"As far as anyone knows," Hogness

said, "to date nobody has been hurt"
by recombinant DNA research. Fears
about disasters in this area, he said, are
"not based on fact; they're based on
imagined scenarios."
At the same meeting Holman called
attention to possible dangers of con
ducting recombinant research close to
hospitals. Holman called for an
examination of the juxtaposition of
low-immunity population and DNA
research.
One campus group, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), favors a com
plete moratorium on recombinant
DNA research. "Until the public can be
educated about DNA," ARC member
David Thorn said, "no decision about
the necessity of research can be made."
Vice President of Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said he felt the fed
eral government would ultimately set
the guidelines for DNA research.
Scientists here are waiting to see
whether the state or federal legisla
tures will propose regulatory DNA
legislation which would affect genetic
research at the University.
Currently a proposal is before the
state assembly which would strictly
regulate recombinant DNA research at
nearly a dozen campuses in California
and for any private companies en

gaged in the work.
Presently all federally funded in
stitutions, including the University,
are subject to guidelines set up last
year by the National Institute of Health
(NIH). The state proposal would give
the California Health Department au
thority to enforce much tougher regu
lations than the NIH guidelines pro
vide for.
According to Ken Wagstaff, chair
man of the state Health Department, a
bill will probably be presented on the
floor of the assembly by next week.
"We hope to have d hill ready to pre
sent by next week," Wagstaff said. "Al
though it is too early to say what
exactly its contents will be, it won't
differ a great deal from Lappe's origi
nal proposal."
Expected to sponsor
Marc Lappe of the state Health De
partment's Office of Health. Law and
Values drafted the original proposed
DNA legislation. Barry keene (D-
Eureka) isexpected tosponsorthebill.
Biology Prof. Allen Campbell,
chairman of the administrative panel
here on recombinant DNA research,
said he was not certain how a state bill
to regulate research would affect Stan
ford.
"I have not seen the text of any prop
osal," Campbell said. "If a bill is pas
sed, it will impose stricter regulations
on our research, but that's all I know so
far."
Disagreement exists among profes
sors here over whether NIH regula
tions need be changed at all. David
Clayton, associate professor of pathol
ogy and a scientist involved in DNA
research, said he felt NIH guidelines
sufficiently covered any dangers that
could arise in research.
'Best job possible'
Clayton pointed out that the NIH
guidelines are "as strict or stricter"
than the guidelines for handling
dangerous organisms like anthrax or
botulism. The fact that no serious ac
