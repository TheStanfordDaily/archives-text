## Chorus, Moffo join symphony 
### 
Semi-professional community
orchestras always present prob
lems for the music critic. If he
judges by professional stan
dards, he is forced to pan them,
while amateur standards are
misleading to the reader, and in
sulting to the orchestra.
Furthermore, such groups
vary widely, depending on the
caliber of players available and
the degree of financial backing.
The San Carlos Symphony, di
rected by James Tippey. is just
such an orchestra. Founded only
two years ago, the players are
drawn from the ranks of students
and semi-professional perfor
mers. Thursday 1 attended their
"Opera Night '7 7," featuring
soprano Anna Moffo and the
Stanford University Chorus.
The orchestra was quite good
but uneven. The weak violins
were balanced by an impres
sively talented wind section,
which was prominantly featured
in most of the selections, notably
the Rossini Italian in Algiers
Overture and the Borodin
Polovetsian Dances.
The brass section was also
strong, as evidenced by a techni
cally adequate rendition of the
Wagner Prelude to Meister
singer. The percussion, how
ever, was not only inaccurate but
far too loud (the senior citizens
around me were cringing).
Tippey is a sloppy conductor

and, more importantly, he
doesn't seem to evoke the type of
enthusiasm that can transform u
group like the San Carlos Sym
phony into an inspired and in
spiring ensemble.
Orchestrally, the highlight of
the evening was the Ballet Music
from Le Cid by Massenet, which
was bouyant and rhythmic.
However, most people in the au
dience (which filled less than
half of Fli lit Center) came to hear
Anna Moffo, who sang five areas
from the standard Italian re
petoire: Puccini, Donazetti,
Verdi and Leoncavallo.
Her voice is not what it used to
he in the days she took the world
by storm — her highs have lost
some of their easy incisiveness,
although her low range is still
pleasant. Yet there were mo
ments of magic and a moving
"Vissa d'arte" from Tosca.
Tippey was unable to keep the
orchestra together with Moffo,
and she stood with a Pieta-like
expression of infinite patience
when Tippey had to start one
selection twice.
The Stanford Chorus, directed
by William Ramsey, joined the
Symphony for the grand finale
— the Polovetsiun Dunces by
Borodin. The Chorus sang with
accuracy and feeling although,
despite obvious effort, they did
not project strongly enough to
match the orchestral fortes.

soprano Anna Moffo and the
Stanford University Chorus.
The orchestra was quite good
but uneven. The weak violins
were balanced by an impres
sively talented wind section,
which was prominantly featured
in most of the selections, notably
the Rossini Italian in Algiers
Overture and the Borodin
Polovetsian Dances.
The brass section was also
strong, as evidenced by a techni
cally adequate rendition of the
Wagner Prelude to Meister
singer. The percussion, how
ever, was not only inaccurate but
far too loud (the senior citizens
around me were cringing).
Tippey is a sloppy conductor

and, more importantly, he
doesn't seem to evoke the type of
enthusiasm that can transform u
group like the San Carlos Sym
phony into an inspired and in
spiring ensemble.
Orchestrally, the highlight of
the evening was the Ballet Music
from Le Cid by Massenet, which
was bouyant and rhythmic.
However, most people in the au
dience (which filled less than
half of Fli lit Center) came to hear
Anna Moffo, who sang five areas
from the standard Italian re
petoire: Puccini, Donazetti,
Verdi and Leoncavallo.
Her voice is not what it used to
he in the days she took the world
by storm — her highs have lost
some of their easy incisiveness,
although her low range is still
pleasant. Yet there were mo
ments of magic and a moving
"Vissa d'arte" from Tosca.
Tippey was unable to keep the
orchestra together with Moffo,
and she stood with a Pieta-like
expression of infinite patience
when Tippey had to start one
selection twice.
The Stanford Chorus, directed
by William Ramsey, joined the
Symphony for the grand finale
— the Polovetsiun Dunces by
Borodin. The Chorus sang with
accuracy and feeling although,
despite obvious effort, they did
not project strongly enough to
match the orchestral fortes.
