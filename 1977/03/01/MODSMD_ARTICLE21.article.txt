Amin postpones Entebbe meeting
Nairobi, Kenya — President Idi Amin has lifted
his ban on Americans leaving Uganda, his govern
ment radio announced today.
Radio Uganda quoted Amin as saying all Ameri
cans in his country should feel free to go about their
normal plans "such as going on normal leave or
carrying on other business within or outside
Uganda."
An earlier broadcast from Kampala said Amin has
postponed the meeting set for tomorrow with the
Americans in Uganda, estimated to number about
240.
The meeting had been scheduled for Entebbe Air
port outside Kampala.
The broadcast from Kampala said another date for
the meeting would be announced later. It gave no
further details.
After the broadcast, the U.S. State Department
withdrew plans to have a top American diplomat
attend the Entebbe meeting, department sources
said. The department said it would have no official
comment on the latest Ugandan broadcast until
today at the earliest.
The diplomat. Talcott Seelye, is an experienced
troubleshooter currently on a two-week tour of Af
rica. The sources said he was to have gone to Uganda
in response to Amin's invitation for a U.S. represen
tative to attend tomorrow's meeting.
Earlier in the day, the Kampala radio said Amin
told a small group of Americans at Entebbe they were
"brothers and sisters" to Ugandans and he intended
to honor them and all other Americans in the country
at the mass meeting tomorrow.
The postponement caught the State Department
by surprise. During the day, while it prepared plans
for the Seelye mission, officials gave assurances that
there was "no cause for alarm" about the scheduled
meeting tomorrow.
Seeking clarification, Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance said the Ugandan charge here, Paul Cherubet,
was being called in for consultations. He will confer

with Philip Habit), the undersecretary for political
affairs.
Foreign fishing ban begins
A two-month ban on all foreign fishing within 200
miles of the West Coast became effective at midnight
yesterday when the Coast Cuard began enforcing a
controversial new law.
The new limit also curtailed some foreign fishing
on the Eastern coast, but California and the Pacific
Northwest got the sharpest cutbacks in fishing.
Vice Adm. Austin Wagner, commander of the
Guard district stretching from Central California to
the Canadian border, said "there will be frequent air
patrols" to enforce the new law.
The 1976 Fishery Conservation and Management
Act extends the former 12-mile fishing limit to 200
miles for virtually all species offish. One major ex
ception is tuna, which the U.S. Commerce Depart
ment has declared too migratory to control. The new
law has no affect on whales, the Cuard said.
The Guard is empowered to board foreign fishing
vessels within the limit and inspect catches and
equipment for violations. Penalties for violations
could range from a verbal warning to seizure of the
vessel.
Weather causes big trade deficit
Washington — A record monthly trade deficit and
the biggest drop in the nation's economic indicators
index since the 1974-75 recession were blamed by
the government yesterday on the severe January
weather.
Because of plant shutdowns and transportation
snarls, exports of goods declined 7.8 per cent during
the month to give the nation a deficit in its foreign
trade of nearly $1.7 billion.
The indicators index that is supposed to
foreshadow future economic trends was off 1.2 per
cent in January, the biggest decline since a 3 percent
drop in January of 1975 during the depths of the
recession.
The Commerce Department said the weather was a

major contributor to both adverse economic reports.
It said it "had a pronounced impact in diminishing
the volume of goods moving out of the country."
Meeting held to avoid BART halt
Oakland — Management and union leaders met
yesterday in an attempt to avert a possible shutdown
by Bay Area Rapid Transit trains today.
"We expect service to operate normally and we're
going to be meeting with the union today to resolve
whatever issues they feel they have," BART spokes
man Mike Healy said. "I think we'll work it out."
The Amalgamated Transit Union called a general
membership meeting for 4 a.m. today to discuss a
variety of alleged contract violations by manage
ment.
Brown reports to Carter on drought
A Brown administration report to President Jimmy
Carter estimates the cost of the drought to Califor
nians at $4 billion, with about half of the loss suf
fered in agriculture.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. took a copy of the report
with him to the National Governors' Conference in
Washington. D.C., and he presented it to Carter yes
terday, aides said.
Brown said he would ask Carter to speed up loans
and other assistance to farmers and cut red tape in
federal drought-assistance programs.
Meanwhile, engineers were slated to shut off some
State Water Project pumping at midnight yesterday,
halting the flow of Northern California water over
the Tehachapis.
And another drought-related emergency was pre
dicted by a state senator — a potential shortage of
water this spring and summer for firefighting.
Today's weather
Forecast windy and cool through tomorrow. Fair
today and tomorrow. Lows in the mid :10s to mid 40s.
Highs both days in the 50s.

at the mass meeting tomorrow.
The postponement caught the State Department
by surprise. During the day, while it prepared plans
for the Seelye mission, officials gave assurances that
there was "no cause for alarm" about the scheduled
meeting tomorrow.
Seeking clarification, Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance said the Ugandan charge here, Paul Cherubet,
was being called in for consultations. He will confer

with Philip Habit), the undersecretary for political
affairs.
Foreign fishing ban begins
A two-month ban on all foreign fishing within 200
miles of the West Coast became effective at midnight
yesterday when the Coast Cuard began enforcing a
controversial new law.
The new limit also curtailed some foreign fishing
on the Eastern coast, but California and the Pacific
Northwest got the sharpest cutbacks in fishing.
Vice Adm. Austin Wagner, commander of the
Guard district stretching from Central California to
the Canadian border, said "there will be frequent air
patrols" to enforce the new law.
The 1976 Fishery Conservation and Management
Act extends the former 12-mile fishing limit to 200
miles for virtually all species offish. One major ex
ception is tuna, which the U.S. Commerce Depart
ment has declared too migratory to control. The new
law has no affect on whales, the Cuard said.
The Guard is empowered to board foreign fishing
vessels within the limit and inspect catches and
equipment for violations. Penalties for violations
could range from a verbal warning to seizure of the
vessel.
Weather causes big trade deficit
Washington — A record monthly trade deficit and
the biggest drop in the nation's economic indicators
index since the 1974-75 recession were blamed by
the government yesterday on the severe January
weather.
Because of plant shutdowns and transportation
snarls, exports of goods declined 7.8 per cent during
the month to give the nation a deficit in its foreign
trade of nearly $1.7 billion.
The indicators index that is supposed to
foreshadow future economic trends was off 1.2 per
cent in January, the biggest decline since a 3 percent
drop in January of 1975 during the depths of the
recession.
The Commerce Department said the weather was a

major contributor to both adverse economic reports.
It said it "had a pronounced impact in diminishing
the volume of goods moving out of the country."
Meeting held to avoid BART halt
Oakland — Management and union leaders met
yesterday in an attempt to avert a possible shutdown
by Bay Area Rapid Transit trains today.
"We expect service to operate normally and we're
going to be meeting with the union today to resolve
whatever issues they feel they have," BART spokes
man Mike Healy said. "I think we'll work it out."
The Amalgamated Transit Union called a general
membership meeting for 4 a.m. today to discuss a
variety of alleged contract violations by manage
ment.
Brown reports to Carter on drought
A Brown administration report to President Jimmy
Carter estimates the cost of the drought to Califor
nians at $4 billion, with about half of the loss suf
fered in agriculture.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. took a copy of the report
with him to the National Governors' Conference in
Washington. D.C., and he presented it to Carter yes
terday, aides said.
Brown said he would ask Carter to speed up loans
and other assistance to farmers and cut red tape in
federal drought-assistance programs.
Meanwhile, engineers were slated to shut off some
State Water Project pumping at midnight yesterday,
halting the flow of Northern California water over
the Tehachapis.
And another drought-related emergency was pre
dicted by a state senator — a potential shortage of
water this spring and summer for firefighting.
Today's weather
Forecast windy and cool through tomorrow. Fair
today and tomorrow. Lows in the mid :10s to mid 40s.
Highs both days in the 50s.
Amin postpones Entebbe meeting
Nairobi, Kenya — President Idi Amin has lifted
his ban on Americans leaving Uganda, his govern
ment radio announced today.
Radio Uganda quoted Amin as saying all Ameri
cans in his country should feel free to go about their
normal plans "such as going on normal leave or
carrying on other business within or outside
Uganda."
An earlier broadcast from Kampala said Amin has
postponed the meeting set for tomorrow with the
Americans in Uganda, estimated to number about
240.
The meeting had been scheduled for Entebbe Air
port outside Kampala.
The broadcast from Kampala said another date for
the meeting would be announced later. It gave no
further details.
After the broadcast, the U.S. State Department
withdrew plans to have a top American diplomat
attend the Entebbe meeting, department sources
said. The department said it would have no official
comment on the latest Ugandan broadcast until
today at the earliest.
The diplomat. Talcott Seelye, is an experienced
troubleshooter currently on a two-week tour of Af
rica. The sources said he was to have gone to Uganda
in response to Amin's invitation for a U.S. represen
tative to attend tomorrow's meeting.
Earlier in the day, the Kampala radio said Amin
told a small group of Americans at Entebbe they were
"brothers and sisters" to Ugandans and he intended
to honor them and all other Americans in the country
at the mass meeting tomorrow.

Weather causes big trade deficit
Washington — A record monthly trade deficit and
the biggest drop in the nation's economic indicators
index since the 1974-75 recession were blamed by
the government yesterday on the severe January
weather.
Because of plant shutdowns and transportation
snarls, exports of goods declined 7.8 per cent during
the month to give the nation a deficit in its foreign
trade of nearly $1.7 billion.
The indicators index that is supposed to
foreshadow future economic trends was off 1.2 per
cent in January, the biggest decline since a 3 percent
drop in January of 1975 during the depths of the
recession.
The Commerce Department said the weather was a

major contributor to both adverse economic reports.
It said it "had a pronounced impact in diminishing
the volume of goods moving out of the country."

Brown reports to Carter on drought
A Brown administration report to President Jimmy
Carter estimates the cost of the drought to Califor
nians at $4 billion, with about half of the loss suf
fered in agriculture.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. took a copy of the report
with him to the National Governors' Conference in
Washington. D.C., and he presented it to Carter yes
terday, aides said.
Brown said he would ask Carter to speed up loans

federal drought-assistance programs.

State Water Project pumping at midnight yesterday,
halting the flow of Northern California water over
the Tehachapis.
