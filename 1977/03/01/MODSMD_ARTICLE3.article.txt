# Senate changes guest prof board
## 
### Jill Liscom 
The ASSIJ senate voted 11-2 last
night that all five members of the Cu est
Professor Board must be nominated by
the Committee on Nominations and
appointed by the senate.
Alternate Sen. Tim Ferguson, who
submitted the amendment with Sen.
Dave Sharp, said this change "makes
everyone who wants to serve on this
board go through an equal process."
As the selection process now stands,
only two board members are ap
pointed by the senate. SCIRE, SWOPSI
and the Action Research Liason Or
ganization each appoint one member
to make up the remainder of the board.
Tom Craham. student codirector of
SWOPSI, stated in a letter to senate
Chairman Pat Hall that changing the
membership "will change the intent of
the original board and will possibly
violate the will expressed during the
1974 (ASvSU) election."
The senate also approved program
fee allocations recommended by Fi
nancial Manager Chris Matheand Fi
nance Committee Chairman Dan
Livingston, including a program fee
discretionary fund of $1830.
According to Mathe. keeping money
to be allocated next year is "a more
efficient use of funds" because the
groups will know more precisely in
the fall what their financial needs are.
Also, many organizations this yearand
in the past were unable to meet the
application deadline.
Organizations receiving the largest
program fee allocations include the
Publications Board, Escondido Nur
