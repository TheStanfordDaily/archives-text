# Senate changes guest prof board

### Jill Liscom 
The ASSIJ senate voted 11-2 last
night that all five members of the Cu est
Professor Board must be nominated by
the Committee on Nominations and
appointed by the senate.
Alternate Sen. Tim Ferguson, who
submitted the amendment with Sen.
Dave Sharp, said this change "makes
everyone who wants to serve on this
board go through an equal process."
As the selection process now stands,
only two board members are ap
pointed by the senate. SCIRE, SWOPSI
and the Action Research Liason Or
ganization each appoint one member
to make up the remainder of the board.
Tom Craham. student codirector of
SWOPSI, stated in a letter to senate
Chairman Pat Hall that changing the
membership "will change the intent of
the original board and will possibly
violate the will expressed during the
1974 (ASvSU) election."
The senate also approved program
fee allocations recommended by Fi
nancial Manager Chris Matheand Fi
nance Committee Chairman Dan
Livingston, including a program fee
discretionary fund of $1830.
According to Mathe. keeping money
to be allocated next year is "a more
efficient use of funds" because the
groups will know more precisely in
the fall what their financial needs are.
Also, many organizations this yearand
in the past were unable to meet the
application deadline.
Organizations receiving the largest
program fee allocations include the
Publications Board, Escondido Nur
sery School, the Bridge, MEChA,
Inter-Fraternity Council, Volunteers in
Asia and Stanford Chinese Students
Organization.
Livingston also proposed authoriz
ing the financial manager to loan up to
$1000 to the Stanford Sailing Associa
tion (SSA). The senate passed the mo
tion to offset the increasing costs of the
SSA due to the drought.
A large portion of the meeting was
devoted to debate over a bylaw
amendment submitted by Sen. Hick
Morrow stating that "funds for the
elected officials of the ASSU and of the
senate shall be raised through fee as
sessment" to be placed on the spring
ballot.
If the assessment fails, a special
stipend from ASSU funds will be
granted to those new Council of Presi
dents members who need financial
aid. The senate finally voted 10-4 to
refer the amendment to the bylaws
committee.
