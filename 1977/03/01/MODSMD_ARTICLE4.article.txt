# Will Title IX bring sororities?
## 
### George Anders 
"The University is clearly in violation" of this statute,
according to senior Rick Lanman, chairman of the
Inter-Fraternity Council's Title IX committee.
"It's pretty hard to get a case" that Stanford is not in
compliance with this statute, according to Don McLaren,
a public information officer at the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
The issue is whether an anti-sex discrimination law
forbids the University from having fraternities without
sororities. The statute is Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972. And the answer appears to be
anything but clear.
McLaren pointed out that social fraternities and
sororities were exempted from Title IX in 1974, and
asserted "there's not much argument" for the view that
Title IX applies to Stanford's fraternity/no sorority sys
tem.
But, as McLaren noted, "There's a lot of trouble when
reading Title IX as to deciding what it means." fames
Siena, legal adviser to the president here, said he inter
prets Title IX differently.
Siena observed that the exemption of fraternities and
sororities is included under the heading "Membership
practices of certain organizations." Therefore, he said,
the exemption does not apply to another section forbid
ding sex discrimination in university housing.
"Mavbe the situation is ambiguous," Siena said. He
also said the University decided on its interpretation of
Title IX without consulting non-University lawyers and
that "It never occurred to us to check with HEW." Still,
he added. "The feeling was that this was sufficiently
troublesome as a legal matter that the prudent thing
would be for the University to clear it up."
To clear things up. the University will ask the Board of
Trustees to rescind its 1944 ban of sororities, "barring
anything we haven't anticipated," according to Norm
Robinson, acting associate dean of student affairs.
James I vons, dean of student affairs, also said there is a

good chance the trustees will be asked to repeal their
ban.
"My guess is that if the administration recommends
this, the trustees will probably approve it," Robinson
said.
Lyons said administrators are seeking to prepare the
request for the trustees' April meeting or at a later spring
meeting.
Although decisions about sororities are being affected
by Title IX, "a desire to create a situation of equity" is
also a factor. Lyons said. Robinson also said "I don't
think this is bccause of Tide IX per se."
Administrators are beginning to consider ways
sororities could be added to the University housing sys
tem. "We're trying to gather as much information as we
can find on sororities that had been here" prior to 1944,
Lyons said.
Sororities would need additional housing, Lyons said,
since administrators are reluctant to reduce draw hous
ing to make room for a house, such as a sorority, where
residents are selected for subjective reasons.
It would take at least two years for a sorority to build a
new house, Lyons said, although he declined to estimate
how long it would take before a full-fledged sorority
could exist here.
Other sorority issues that may come up, Lyons said,
are what the University could do to help sorority chap
ters get established and how the University could help in
fundraising.
Lyons said, though, that the University has not con
tacted any national sororities and probably will not do
so. "That's a matter for individual women students," he
said.
Although Title IX took effect in July, 1975, adminis
trators only became concerned a few months ago about
its implications for the fraternity/no sorority system
here, Siena said. "We finally got around" to examining
the title, he explained. "It's probably something we
should have come up with earlier."

sororities could be added to the University housing sys
tem. "We're trying to gather as much information as we
can find on sororities that had been here" prior to 1944,
Lyons said.
Sororities would need additional housing, Lyons said,
since administrators are reluctant to reduce draw hous
ing to make room for a house, such as a sorority, where
residents are selected for subjective reasons.
It would take at least two years for a sorority to build a
new house, Lyons said, although he declined to estimate
how long it would take before a full-fledged sorority
could exist here.
Other sorority issues that may come up, Lyons said,
are what the University could do to help sorority chap
ters get established and how the University could help in
fundraising.
Lyons said, though, that the University has not con
tacted any national sororities and probably will not do
so. "That's a matter for individual women students," he
said.
Although Title IX took effect in July, 1975, adminis
trators only became concerned a few months ago about
its implications for the fraternity/no sorority system
here, Siena said. "We finally got around" to examining
the title, he explained. "It's probably something we
should have come up with earlier."
"The University is clearly in violation" of this statute,
according to senior Rick Lanman, chairman of the
Inter-Fraternity Council's Title IX committee.
"It's pretty hard to get a case" that Stanford is not in
compliance with this statute, according to Don McLaren,
a public information officer at the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
The issue is whether an anti-sex discrimination law
forbids the University from having fraternities without
sororities. The statute is Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972. And the answer appears to be
anything but clear.
McLaren pointed out that social fraternities and
sororities were exempted from Title IX in 1974, and
asserted "there's not much argument" for the view that
Title IX applies to Stanford's fraternity/no sorority sys
tem.
But, as McLaren noted, "There's a lot of trouble when
reading Title IX as to deciding what it means." fames
Siena, legal adviser to the president here, said he inter
prets Title IX differently.
Siena observed that the exemption of fraternities and
sororities is included under the heading "Membership
practices of certain organizations." Therefore, he said,
the exemption does not apply to another section forbid
ding sex discrimination in university housing.
"Mavbe the situation is ambiguous," Siena said. He
also said the University decided on its interpretation of
Title IX without consulting non-University lawyers and
that "It never occurred to us to check with HEW." Still,
he added. "The feeling was that this was sufficiently
troublesome as a legal matter that the prudent thing
would be for the University to clear it up."
To clear things up. the University will ask the Board of
Trustees to rescind its 1944 ban of sororities, "barring
anything we haven't anticipated," according to Norm
Robinson, acting associate dean of student affairs.
James I vons, dean of student affairs, also said there is a

good chance the trustees will be asked to repeal their
ban.
"My guess is that if the administration recommends
this, the trustees will probably approve it," Robinson
said.
Lyons said administrators are seeking to prepare the
request for the trustees' April meeting or at a later spring
meeting.
Although decisions about sororities are being affected
by Title IX, "a desire to create a situation of equity" is
also a factor. Lyons said. Robinson also said "I don't
think this is bccause of Tide IX per se."
