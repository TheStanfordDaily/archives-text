# Demonstrators question abstention on Stevens
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Preceding the evening occupation of
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger's reception
office, approximately 100 rallied in
White Plaza at noon and a majority of
them marched to Encina Hall where
the> staged a sit-in in the building's
outer lobby.
When Ausgsburger arrived at 3:30
p.m., they demanded he explain his
decision to have the University abstain
from voting on a proxy resolution that
asked disclosure of J.P. Stevens wage
and labor information. Votes will be
tallied at a shareholders' meeting
today in New York City.
In a tense but nonviolent 50-minute
confrontation, the supporters, most of
them students, sat on the lobby floor
and asked Augsburger why he decided
to abstain from voting for the resolu
tion despite the 3-2 vote by the Univer
sity's own Presidential Commission
on Investment Responsibility (C-IR) to
approve it.
The supporters also asked Au
gsburger to explain how a favorable
votp for the resolution would be "de
trimental to stockholders' interests,"
as he had stated in a Feb. 24 letter to
Stevens Chairman James D. Finley.
"The proposal would ask that the
company provide a lot of information
that competitors will want to know,"
said Augsburger.
Disclosure not detrimental
A sit-in member said the resolution
asked only disclosure of information
that would not be detrimental to the
company.

"Then why vote for it?" Augsburger
asked back.
Augsburger said the resolution
would provide the company with an
"out" to avoid supplying wage and
labor information by claiming it would
be detrimental to the company.
"Then nothing reallv happens."
said Augsburger.
The sit-in followed a noon rally at
White Plaza which attracted approxi
mately 100 persons. After hearing
speeches from Anthropology Prof. St.
Clair Drake, Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier and four others,
about HO supporters marched to En
cina Hall.
The group paused briefly on the
sidewalk before entering Encina Hall.
Marchers clapped their hands and
chanted "We want Augsburger" and
"People not profits; 'yes' on two."
The University abstained from vot
ing on the second of two resolutions
submitted by the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, a coalition
of churches which own Stevens stock.
One yes vote
The University voted in favor of the
first resolution which asked that Ste
vens disclose its equal employment
opportunity and affirmative action
policies and practices.
Encina Hall employes conducted
their business, threading their way
through the aisles left by the protesters
who sat on the floor from 1 p.m. until
3:30 p.m. when Augsburger spoke to
them.
Committee for Justice member Steve
Vettel said Augsburger told him in a
phone call yesterday morning that he
(Augsburger) would try to be at his
Encina office between 1 and 1:30.
Declaring that Augsburger did not
satisfactorily answer any questions
they had posed to him, approximately
60 of the protesters at about 5 p.m.
voted with one abstention to remain in
the building. The proposal to remain
was made by Committee for Justice
member Peter Necarsulmer.
Letter more effective
Pressed by the demonstrators to exp
lain why he abstained from voting on
the second resolution and sent a letter
to Finley, Augsburger replied, "My
judgment is that it's (the letter) much
more effective. ... I think you're mis
representing me. It (letter) says a lot
more than the vote." said Augsburger,
pacing along the aisle in Encina lobby,
hands in his pockets.
"The available evidence does
suggest that they (Stevens) have bro
ken the law. But all we have seen is the
evidence from one side because the
company has chosen not to defend it
self publicly," said Augsburger.
Stevens has been found guilty of 15
National Labor Relations Act viola
tions, said Necarsulmer, adding that a
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith research report predicted Ste
vens would sell products at smaller
profit margins in order to ensure more
advance sales in case a nationwide
boycott of Stevens products is success
ful.
At the noon rally in White Plaza.
(MR member and law student Jill Nel
son told the audience, "The C-IR is a
powerless showpiece to deflect com
munity pressure from the adminis
trators and allows them to pursue their
own investment policies."
