## Opinions Action—not mere words

(Lust of two parts.)
A month ago, a series of meetings
on genetic manipulation took place
here. Both friends and foes of recom
binant DNA research agree that in its
potential — for good or bad — this
work constitutes the most important
practical science since atomic energy
was harnessed.
Audience and speakers came from
Oakland, Los Angeles and Cambridge,
and included Palo Alto City Council
members and leaders in the medical
and research fields. Overflow crowds
were in attendance.
In the past three years 1 have done
graduate work in four humanities de
partments and come to recognize a
couple hundred faces among their
grad students and teaching staffs. A
sum total of three attended these im
portant meetings.
Non-attendance
1 am not pointing a finger at specific
individuals. Clearly persons have all
kinds of commitments and alternative
sources of information. (Nor am 1 ask
ing praise for spending six hours in a
pleasant auditorium.) But the non
attendance, as a group, of those whose
business it is to know better, was dis
turbing.
Where were the English professors
who discourse so eloquently on issues
of culture and freedom? Where were
the Modernists? Where were the
humanities persons whose private
colloquium for this week concerns
"the humanistic enterprise" and "out
side pressures on the university"?
Where were the writers, directors and
critics who teach and study here?

Much of the discussion concerned
whether scientists could be trusted,
and whether planned high security
(F3, P4) laboratories could indeed pre
vent the escape of modified species. I
saw no major reason to impugn the
researchers' motives, nor to doubt that
their techniques are potentially safe.
Human fallibility
But in laboratories, as with law, de
sign does not ensure compliance. All
my humanities training suggests that
the fault, dear Dr. Hogness, lies not in
our systems, but ourselves, that we are
hazardous. I don't question your abil
ity to design rational models, but am
appalled by the blithe assumption that
chance and human nature have
adhered to them.
People can be too sure of their own
knowledge. Thus they conduct
above-ground nuclear tests and only
later discover strontium 90.
People can be reckless when posses
sed of esoteric knowledge, like the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH) resear
chers who reputedly perform P3 ex
periments on table tops.
People can be politically afraid.
Thus a junior faculty member up for
tenure might not publicize the risks
involved in the work of his superior,
who wants a Nobel Peace Prize.
People (it only takes a few) can be
ambitious; someone might conduct
proscribed experiments with animal
or human DNA taken from a hospital.
People can be a bit too enthusiasti
cally smooth, like the scientist whose
audio-visual display implied that the
size of a substituted gene had anything
to do with its effects.

And people can be shortsighted, re
fusing to consider the ethical impact,
not of current research, but its future
possibilities.
These are concerns which mandate
the combined evaluations of
humanists and scientists. The former
should have been there in large num
bers to participate, to listen and to
learn.
Their collective absence is related to
the presence of Milton I'riedman in
Chile (though nowhere so deplorable).
In the case of Friedman, we have a man
of superior intellect who feels that his
theoretical pursuits necessitate and
justify collaboration with a murderous
regime. He arrogates the right to make
decisions that affect unrepresented
persons' lives.
What is the error of uninvolved
humanists? They also shelter in
selected abstraction, in theoretical
speculation which need not confront
details outside "their field." Should
moral and political" distribution re
quirements get shelved with their
bachelor's diplomas?
The problem lies with discipline.
Not the mastery of "a discipline" like
economics, cell physiology or political
science, but with the loss of that self
discipline which keeps our work not
only rational, not just self-sustaining,
but also right.
It is essential that gifted people learn
to regulate their talents, to keep their
interests broad and deep, both private
and public. Otherwise, whether writ
ers, doctors, lawyers, actors or execu
tives, they become mere professionals.
Talents refined in isolation are the
tools of social chaos.

of culture and freedom? Where were
the Modernists? Where were the
humanities persons whose private
colloquium for this week concerns
"the humanistic enterprise" and "out
side pressures on the university"?
Where were the writers, directors and
critics who teach and study here?

Much of the discussion concerned
whether scientists could be trusted,
and whether planned high security
(F3, P4) laboratories could indeed pre
vent the escape of modified species. I
saw no major reason to impugn the
researchers' motives, nor to doubt that
their techniques are potentially safe.
Human fallibility
But in laboratories, as with law, de
sign does not ensure compliance. All
my humanities training suggests that
the fault, dear Dr. Hogness, lies not in
our systems, but ourselves, that we are
hazardous. I don't question your abil
ity to design rational models, but am
appalled by the blithe assumption that
chance and human nature have
adhered to them.
People can be too sure of their own
knowledge. Thus they conduct
above-ground nuclear tests and only
later discover strontium 90.
People can be reckless when posses
sed of esoteric knowledge, like the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH) resear
chers who reputedly perform P3 ex
periments on table tops.
People can be politically afraid.
Thus a junior faculty member up for
tenure might not publicize the risks
involved in the work of his superior,
who wants a Nobel Peace Prize.
People (it only takes a few) can be
ambitious; someone might conduct
proscribed experiments with animal
or human DNA taken from a hospital.
People can be a bit too enthusiasti
cally smooth, like the scientist whose
audio-visual display implied that the
size of a substituted gene had anything
to do with its effects.

And people can be shortsighted, re
fusing to consider the ethical impact,
not of current research, but its future
possibilities.
These are concerns which mandate
the combined evaluations of
humanists and scientists. The former
should have been there in large num
bers to participate, to listen and to
learn.
Their collective absence is related to
the presence of Milton I'riedman in
Chile (though nowhere so deplorable).
In the case of Friedman, we have a man
of superior intellect who feels that his
theoretical pursuits necessitate and
justify collaboration with a murderous
regime. He arrogates the right to make
decisions that affect unrepresented
persons' lives.
What is the error of uninvolved
humanists? They also shelter in
selected abstraction, in theoretical
speculation which need not confront
details outside "their field." Should
moral and political" distribution re
quirements get shelved with their
bachelor's diplomas?
The problem lies with discipline.
Not the mastery of "a discipline" like
economics, cell physiology or political
science, but with the loss of that self
discipline which keeps our work not
only rational, not just self-sustaining,
but also right.
It is essential that gifted people learn
to regulate their talents, to keep their
interests broad and deep, both private
and public. Otherwise, whether writ
ers, doctors, lawyers, actors or execu
tives, they become mere professionals.
Talents refined in isolation are the
tools of social chaos.

A month ago, a series of meetings
on genetic manipulation took place
here. Both friends and foes of recom
binant DNA research agree that in its
potential — for good or bad — this
work constitutes the most important
practical science since atomic energy
was harnessed.
Audience and speakers came from
Oakland, Los Angeles and Cambridge,
and included Palo Alto City Council
members and leaders in the medical
and research fields. Overflow crowds
were in attendance.
In the past three years 1 have done
graduate work in four humanities de
partments and come to recognize a
couple hundred faces among their
grad students and teaching staffs. A
sum total of three attended these im
portant meetings.

individuals. Clearly persons have all
