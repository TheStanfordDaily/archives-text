Your strong endorsement was of
great comfort to us and was a signific
ant factor in the success of the cam

Abortion
I always wonder about people — and
especially, men — who speak out
against abortion, who call it "murder'
and a mere matter of "convenience."
Bandow's specious polemic (Daily,
Feb. 16) on this head makes me won
der whether he has ever been, for
example, a 19-year-old woman with a
period three months overdue, terrified
and quite certain, though not clini
cally positive, that she is pregnant. I
am not sure he can imagine the desp
eration he would feel, if he were in this
position, without income, supportive
family or boyfriend, and perhaps de

sirous of realizing personal ambitions
in direct conflict with nurturing a
child before and after birth.
Abortion is not to be taken lightly, if
only because it is at least an emotion
ally rending experience. But I deny
that we women who prefer to have an
abortion rather than a child we are not
ready or able to support financially or
emotionally are abetting murder. Yes,
it is a "convenience" — at some risk to
the prospective mother — but is Ban
dow or other detractors of legalized
abortion willing to defray the many
costs of those children whose mothers
may not yet even be able to fully sup
port themselves? How many of those
on the Right-to-Life bandwagon are re
ally behind welfare (AFCD) or other
forms of subsidized pregnancies?
Finally, in Bandow's championship
of "life" over "convenience," the next
logical step would surely seem the out
lawing of contraceptive measures. Sex
is an integral part of the life process,
and therefore, we cannot litigate
against it. Going a step farther, can we,
by any moral standard, sully the purity
of the sex act? Surely birth control
should not be a right people may freely
exercise. If we are forced to give up this
convenience, we will eliminate at the
same time another potential source of
conflict — the rights of the uncon
ceived.

the prospective mother — but is Ban
dow or other detractors of legalized
abortion willing to defray the many
costs of those children whose mothers
may not yet even be able to fully sup
port themselves? How many of those
on the Right-to-Life bandwagon are re
ally behind welfare (AFCD) or other
forms of subsidized pregnancies?
Finally, in Bandow's championship
of "life" over "convenience," the next
logical step would surely seem the out
lawing of contraceptive measures. Sex
is an integral part of the life process,
and therefore, we cannot litigate
against it. Going a step farther, can we,
by any moral standard, sully the purity
of the sex act? Surely birth control
should not be a right people may freely
exercise. If we are forced to give up this
convenience, we will eliminate at the
same time another potential source of
conflict — the rights of the uncon
ceived.
