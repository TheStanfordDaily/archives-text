County hospitals are in trouble.

Sherman Mellinkoff, dean of the UCLA Medical Si lu» 11
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center's (VMC) jeopai
dized accreditation and the threat of cutbacks at t i<
Medical School (Daily, Feb. lH)area local manifestation
of an immediate, statewide problem.
Los Angeles County alone will lose an estimated $ 1 •>
million this fiscal year largely because of extensive m
equities in the Medi-Cal system. The state supplements
federal medical care to the poor through Medi-Cal.
Unable to refuse medical care to anyone under state
law, the counties must absorb the cost of state-mandated
services that the state does not pay for.
Counterproductive
In addition, the insistence of the state on treating
counties as private providers in an effort to contain costs
has been counterproductive, Mellinkoff said in tes
timony before the State Assembly Health Committee last
October.
These state policies "add substantial nonproductive
overhead expense, frustration and inefficiency tocount\
operations," he said.
VMC is "extremely well off" when compared to otliei
county hospitals, according to Leo Smith, director o!

planning at VMC.
' " s ■' Angeles County's health care? program has already
" ' 11 threatened with massive cutbacks this year l)y the
JOard of supervisors. If what Smith calls the "present
stem continues to be implemented in unchanged
1,1 ( ' ie already serious situation could worsen
statewide.
Mate officials and hospital administrators all agree
1 <" it is ,i complex problem. There also exists a consen
t's that much of the problem stems from the Reagan
administration's Medi-Cal Rnform Act of 1971.
'Need for change'
hen the act was first introduced, "it was pretty much
acknowledged by all parties that there was a need tor
change,'' Smith said.
l'i'ior to the act, a "county option" existed. This was a
provision in the original Medi-Cal bill which stated that
the state had a legal responsibility to pay the counties'
costs of care for the medically indigent, Smith said.
In addition to the regular Medi-Cal budget, $3 5 mill
ion was budgeted annually to provide for the medically
indigent, those not eligible for Medi-Cal.
Hut the state always underbudgeted Medi-Cal, Smith
said, and the medical indigent allocation was never in
< Teased or adjusted for inflation. The counties had no
alternative but to make up the difference.
I wice, in 1967 and 1971, Reagan predicted deficits in
the state budget and attempted to make broad custs in
Medi-Cal. Both times the cuts were eventually ruled
illegal and rescinded, but the reaction by county and
hospital administrators to the second attempted cut was
so vehement that the Reagan administration responded

with the 1971 reform act
Despite opposition from the president of the California
Medical Association, the County Supervisors Associa
tion, and Howard Campen, then Santa Clara county
executive, the bill was passed.
"The counties went along with it. They were kinda
stuck. There was an acknowledged need for change, the
state said, 'we're going to take care of the medically
indigent,' and we really had nothing to supplant it
with," said Smith.
Unfortunately. Cam pen correctly predicted that the
reform act would create "absolutechaos in theadminist
ration of medical care" and "cause a substantial increase
in county costs that would fall on the property tax
payers."
"As far as actual reform, the Medi-Cal reform act did
not do all it promised," said Smith. "The state did not
pick up all the medically indigent like they promised.
We're back at that position today, with major counties
making major cutbai ks."
Uniform standard
The act established a new, uniform standard of medi
cal indigency, based on the total value of personal prop
erty holdings, said Smith. Only one fourth of the persons
counties actually had to deal with were eligible for
Medi-Cal under this standard, however, Smith pointed
out. Thus, counties once again had to fall back on their
own financial resources to provide care, he said.
At the same time the counties' financial resources
were effectively restricted by passage ofS.B. 90, which
set a maximum level to which the tax rate can rise.
