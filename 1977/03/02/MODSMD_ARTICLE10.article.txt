# A 						Stanford education

As I get ready to sell off the books
and the bike, and head out for the Real
World, I'm wondering what in the hell
I've learned at this place.
Certainly I don't remember too
much of that stuff my transcript says
I'm supposed to know. Too bad my
transcript doesn't show the things I've
learned from the people here.
Just so you know, my freshman
friends, what a Stanford education can
garner in four years, a catalog of the
assorted trivia I've picked up:
—A Chicano is not a native of
Chicago.
—Arabica coffee is grown in Africa
and is cheaper than the robusta coffee
grown in South America.
—There are actually people who
have lived in one place all their lives,
are proud of that place and intend to go
back there.
—When an earthquake comes, stand
in a doorframe.
—Willamette, Oregon is pro
nounced Wil-I,AM-ette, Ory-gun, not
WILL-iam-ette, Ora-gone.
—A native American is not neces
sarily anyone who was born in the Un
ited States.
—A burrito is warm brown
cardboard wrapped around some
mashed up beans and hamburger; a
bao is a sweet Chinese version of a
knish.
—The island o4 Hawaii is called the
Big Island, but Honolulu is on Oahu.
Everyone in Hawaii lives in Honolulu

and went to high school at Punahou or
lolani.
—The Pasha Mustapha Theory of
History: If you memorize some obscure
facts like Pasha Mustapha being head
of Egypt when France and England
were fighting about the Eastern Ques
tion. your history professors will think
you know all the important facts.
—My native town of St. Louis is
good for one thing at least — Bud is
vastly superior to Coors, and Michelob
is the only thing to drink at cast par
ties.
—Not all the 300,000 occupants of
Wyoming are sheep.
—Never say "he feels" or "he
thinks" in a newspaper article.
—Those who are blind can some
times see more than those who are
sighted.
—Tresidder is spelled with one "s"
and two "d"s.
—It is possible to be a decent person
despite having been a preppie, cheer
leader or editor of the high school
yearbook.
—"How much?" is "Skokla?" in
Russian, "Weivel?" in German,
"Combien?" in French and "Que
costa?" in Italian (From Stanford-in-
Interrail).
—No history book ever told me that
some American citizens during WW II
were considered "alien" enough to be
placed in "relocation camps." Ameri
ca atones for its sins though, 1 guess.
Many of those citizens' sons and

daughters go to Stanford, and are
working to make sure the history
books don't leave out the relocation
camps.
—Approximately one-third of the
American colonists supported the Re
volution, one-third were loyalists and
the other third just wanted to stay
home and make Bicentennial
souvenirs.
—Sacramento is not equidistant be
tween San Francisco and Los Angeles.
S.F. and 1,.A. are not close together just
because they're in the same state.
—"Molded" means "embarrassed"
according to "The Folks" in L.A. "I
hear you" in jive-talk does not refer to
one's auditory ability, but to one's em
pathy with a previous statement.
—There's not much to see in eastern
Washington, but it's the biggest
wheat-producing area in the country.
—What I thought were "mountains"
across the "ocean" turned out to be
"foothills" across the "bay." I guess
the stature of an elevation, just as the
stature of a man, can best be measured
not by inches — not by stereotypes or
textbooks — but by the mirrors of our
friends' eyes.
And in my reckoning, that's the
most important thing I've learned
here. Goodbye Robert Redford, good
bye $24,000, and goodbye Stanford—
as "The Folks" down in L.A. would
say, "it's been real."
