# DNA research needed

Daniel Suzuki

During the past three years the pub
lic has become aware of a new frontier
in science involving DNA recombin
ant research. Unfortunately, many
people have begun to associate ex
perimentation involving DNA recom
bination with science fiction disaster
scenarios. Responsible scientists have
been pictured as contemporary Dr.
Frankensteins creating new "An
dromeda Strain" types of life capable
of destroying all life forms on Earth.
In the column "DNA Research
Risky" (Daily. Feb. 23) it was stated:
"We condemn the unquestioning at
titude of most established scientists
who glorify the pursuit of knowledge
at any price and who intimidate
perhaps less well established col
leagues who may question the moral
ity of so-called 'pure' science." This is
the sort of "yellow journalistic" ap
proach which has created much of the
distorted views on DNA recombinant
research. Not only is this statement un
founded, but Stanford faculty have
proven the contrary.
The scientific community in gen
eral, and specifically many individual
University faculty members are to be
commended for their high regard for
the public's welfare. The very scien
tists here who were leading the way in
this new field, were the very ones who
alerted their fellow scientists and the
public of the "potential" hazards in
volved. While on the verge of making
some of the most exciting revolutio
nary discoveries of this century, it was
the scientists themselves who pulled
back on their reins and voluntarily
halted experimentation until they
could explore the "potential" dangers.
These actions were not taken by "sci
entists who glorify the pursuit of
knowledge at any price," but rather by
responsible scientists who do have a
sincere concern for the well being of
the public. This is not to claim that
scientists should be blindly entrusted
to establish their own rules, but it is an
attempt to show that scientists are not
wild eyed fanatics only after fame.
Unquestionably, there are risks in
volved in doing DNA recombinant re

search. The greatest potential hazard
probably stems from the unknown fac
tors. One hundred per cent assurance
of safety can never be guaranteed. Man
could have decided never to land on
the moon for fear of bringing back
alien pathogenetic microbes. It cannot
be claimed with 100 per cent accuracy
that the vaccines which have been ad
ministered to millions of children
have not carried agents that will cause
cancer in future years. In the same
manner, it is not certain that the types
of DNA recombinant experiments
which now appear to have no known
hazards could ten years from now re
sult in the death of mankind. The fun
damental question is what de
gree of assurance of safety is needed
before experimentation can take place.
The top scientists in the country
along with the members of the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH) have
addressed themselves to this issue.
The answers to the questions dealing
with the containment of potentially
dangerous organisms produced in ex
perimentation are now integrated in
theNlH guidelines for DNA recombin
ant experimentation.
It is essential to understand that all
DNA recombinant experiments do not
involve the same degree of risk. For
example, it is universally agreed upon
that certain experiments such as the
taking apart of DNA molecules and
subsequent reconstruction of the same
molecules contain no conceivable
hazards. Other types of experimenta
tion are potentially extremely hazard
ous: for example, formation of recom
binant DNAs that contain genes capa
ble of biosynthesizing toxins of very
high toxicity (botulinum or diptheria).
Six types of experiments fit into this
last category and are absolutely ban
ned by the NIH guidelines.
Many experiments are placed
somewhere in the middle in the range
of risks. NIH guidelines are based on
the concept that the higher the risk of
danger, the higher the level of con
tainment the labofatory must provide.
Laboratories are built with various de
grees of containment ranging from Pl,
lowest level of containment, to P 4,
which provides the highest level of
containment possible. Scientists have
deliberately overestimated the poten
tial risks in experimental categories to
be safe beyond reasonable doubt. As a

result, a large class of experiments are
permitted to be carried out only in P 4
facilities. These labs have been de
signed to work with such organisms as
the Lassa fever virus and the Marburg
virus, which have almost 100 per cent
mortality rates in infected persons.
There are only four or five installations
in the United States where P 4 type
experiments could be carried out.
Scientists have severely restricted
their own experimentation to protect
the public. It is of importance to note
that during the past three and a half
years, billions of bacteria containing a
wide range of recombinant DNA
molecules have been grown. No
hazardous consequences have been
discovered. Many of these experi
ments were done in the United States
and abroad before the NIH guidelines
were enacted.
Other criticisms that researchers
face are the moral ones. The argument
is that just as the physicist created the
atom bomb, so the geneticists may
create a hiological bomb. Who knows
what the CIA could do with such
deadly pathogens? I have two replies.
First, people who wish to start plagues
on the other side of the globe already
have at their disposal proven deadly
naturally occurring pathogens. Sec
ondly, nearly all forms of increased
scientific knowledge can be used for
evil. To deny scientific inquiry on
these grounds is to return to the Dark
Ages.
Perhaps, the final question to be
asked is whether we can afford not to
continue DNA recombinant research,
considering as many precautions as
possible are taken. Humanity is
plagued by old diseases and new.
Malnutrition and pollution surround
us. DNA recombination offers hope in
solving at least some of the problems
in these areas.
I propose that the NIH guidelines are
stringent enough. What is needed are
federal laws to enforce them. The pub
lic should have the power to regulate
research, but they must listen carefully
to what responsible scientists say and
they must not be swayed by prefabri
cated disaster scenarios. The Univer
sity should be proud of what our fa
culty has done and not done in the area
of DNA recombinant research.

of DNA recombinant experiments
which now appear to have no known

gree of assurance of safety is needed

The top scientists in the country

tional Institute of Health (NIH) have
addressed themselves to this issue.
The answers to the questions dealing
with the containment of potentially
dangerous organisms produced in ex
perimentation are now integrated in
theNlH guidelines for DNA recombin
ant experimentation.
It is essential to understand that all
DNA recombinant experiments do not
involve the same degree of risk. For
example, it is universally agreed upon
that certain experiments such as the
taking apart of DNA molecules and
subsequent reconstruction of the same
molecules contain no conceivable
hazards. Other types of experimenta
tion are potentially extremely hazard
ous: for example, formation of recom
binant DNAs that contain genes capa
ble of biosynthesizing toxins of very
high toxicity (botulinum or diptheria).
Six types of experiments fit into this
last category and are absolutely ban
ned by the NIH guidelines.
Many experiments are placed
somewhere in the middle in the range
of risks. NIH guidelines are based on
the concept that the higher the risk of
danger, the higher the level of con
tainment the labofatory must provide.
Laboratories are built with various de
grees of containment ranging from Pl,
lowest level of containment, to P 4,
which provides the highest level of
containment possible. Scientists have
deliberately overestimated the poten
tial risks in experimental categories to
be safe beyond reasonable doubt. As a

result, a large class of experiments are
permitted to be carried out only in P 4
facilities. These labs have been de
signed to work with such organisms as
the Lassa fever virus and the Marburg
virus, which have almost 100 per cent
mortality rates in infected persons.
There are only four or five installations
in the United States where P 4 type
experiments could be carried out.
Scientists have severely restricted
their own experimentation to protect
the public. It is of importance to note
that during the past three and a half
years, billions of bacteria containing a
wide range of recombinant DNA
molecules have been grown. No
hazardous consequences have been
discovered. Many of these experi
ments were done in the United States
and abroad before the NIH guidelines
were enacted.
Other criticisms that researchers
face are the moral ones. The argument
is that just as the physicist created the
atom bomb, so the geneticists may
create a hiological bomb. Who knows
what the CIA could do with such
deadly pathogens? I have two replies.
First, people who wish to start plagues
on the other side of the globe already
have at their disposal proven deadly
naturally occurring pathogens. Sec
ondly, nearly all forms of increased
scientific knowledge can be used for
evil. To deny scientific inquiry on
these grounds is to return to the Dark
Ages.
Perhaps, the final question to be
asked is whether we can afford not to
continue DNA recombinant research,
considering as many precautions as
possible are taken. Humanity is
plagued by old diseases and new.
Malnutrition and pollution surround
us. DNA recombination offers hope in
solving at least some of the problems
in these areas.
I propose that the NIH guidelines are
stringent enough. What is needed are
federal laws to enforce them. The pub
lic should have the power to regulate
research, but they must listen carefully
to what responsible scientists say and
they must not be swayed by prefabri
cated disaster scenarios. The Univer
sity should be proud of what our fa
culty has done and not done in the area
of DNA recombinant research.

sult in the death of mankind. The fun
damental question is what de
gree of assurance of safety is needed
before experimentation can take place.
The top scientists in the country
along with the members of the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH) have
addressed themselves to this issue.
The answers to the questions dealing
with the containment of potentially
dangerous organisms produced in ex
perimentation are now integrated in
theNlH guidelines for DNA recombin
ant experimentation.
It is essential to understand that all
DNA recombinant experiments do not
involve the same degree of risk. For
example, it is universally agreed upon
that certain experiments such as the
taking apart of DNA molecules and
subsequent reconstruction of the same
molecules contain no conceivable
hazards. Other types of experimenta
tion are potentially extremely hazard
ous: for example, formation of recom
binant DNAs that contain genes capa
ble of biosynthesizing toxins of very
high toxicity (botulinum or diptheria).
Six types of experiments fit into this
last category and are absolutely ban
ned by the NIH guidelines.
Many experiments are placed
somewhere in the middle in the range
of risks. NIH guidelines are based on
the concept that the higher the risk of
danger, the higher the level of con
tainment the labofatory must provide.
Laboratories are built with various de
grees of containment ranging from Pl,
lowest level of containment, to P 4,
which provides the highest level of
containment possible. Scientists have
deliberately overestimated the poten
tial risks in experimental categories to
be safe beyond reasonable doubt. As a

result, a large class of experiments are
permitted to be carried out only in P 4
facilities. These labs have been de
signed to work with such organisms as
the Lassa fever virus and the Marburg
virus, which have almost 100 per cent
mortality rates in infected persons.
There are only four or five installations
in the United States where P 4 type
experiments could be carried out.
Scientists have severely restricted
their own experimentation to protect
the public. It is of importance to note
that during the past three and a half
years, billions of bacteria containing a
wide range of recombinant DNA
molecules have been grown. No
hazardous consequences have been
discovered. Many of these experi
ments were done in the United States
and abroad before the NIH guidelines
were enacted.
Other criticisms that researchers
face are the moral ones. The argument
is that just as the physicist created the
atom bomb, so the geneticists may
create a hiological bomb. Who knows
what the CIA could do with such
deadly pathogens? I have two replies.
First, people who wish to start plagues
on the other side of the globe already
have at their disposal proven deadly
naturally occurring pathogens. Sec
ondly, nearly all forms of increased
scientific knowledge can be used for
evil. To deny scientific inquiry on
these grounds is to return to the Dark
Ages.
Perhaps, the final question to be
asked is whether we can afford not to
continue DNA recombinant research,
considering as many precautions as
possible are taken. Humanity is
plagued by old diseases and new.
Malnutrition and pollution surround
us. DNA recombination offers hope in
solving at least some of the problems
in these areas.
I propose that the NIH guidelines are
stringent enough. What is needed are
federal laws to enforce them. The pub
lic should have the power to regulate
research, but they must listen carefully
to what responsible scientists say and
they must not be swayed by prefabri
cated disaster scenarios. The Univer
sity should be proud of what our fa
culty has done and not done in the area
of DNA recombinant research.

During the past three years the pub
lic has become aware of a new frontier
in science involving DNA recombin
ant research. Unfortunately, many
people have begun to associate ex
perimentation involving DNA recom
bination with science fiction disaster
scenarios. Responsible scientists have
been pictured as contemporary Dr.
Frankensteins creating new "An
dromeda Strain" types of life capable
of destroying all life forms on Earth.
In the column "DNA Research
Risky" (Daily. Feb. 23) it was stated:
"We condemn the unquestioning at
titude of most established scientists
who glorify the pursuit of knowledge
at any price and who intimidate
perhaps less well established col
leagues who may question the moral
ity of so-called 'pure' science." This is
the sort of "yellow journalistic" ap
proach which has created much of the
distorted views on DNA recombinant
research. Not only is this statement un
founded, but Stanford faculty have
proven the contrary.
The scientific community in gen
eral, and specifically many individual
University faculty members are to be
commended for their high regard for
the public's welfare. The very scien
tists here who were leading the way in
this new field, were the very ones who
alerted their fellow scientists and the
public of the "potential" hazards in
volved. While on the verge of making
some of the most exciting revolutio
nary discoveries of this century, it was
the scientists themselves who pulled
back on their reins and voluntarily
halted experimentation until they
could explore the "potential" dangers.
These actions were not taken by "sci
entists who glorify the pursuit of
knowledge at any price," but rather by
responsible scientists who do have a
sincere concern for the well being of
the public. This is not to claim that
scientists should be blindly entrusted
to establish their own rules, but it is an
attempt to show that scientists are not
wild eyed fanatics only after fame.
Unquestionably, there are risks in
volved in doing DNA recombinant re

search. The greatest potential hazard
probably stems from the unknown fac
tors. One hundred per cent assurance
of safety can never be guaranteed. Man
could have decided never to land on
the moon for fear of bringing back
alien pathogenetic microbes. It cannot
be claimed with 100 per cent accuracy
that the vaccines which have been ad
ministered to millions of children
have not carried agents that will cause
cancer in future years. In the same
manner, it is not certain that the types
of DNA recombinant experiments
which now appear to have no known
hazards could ten years from now re
