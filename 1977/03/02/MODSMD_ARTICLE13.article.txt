Abortion
Let's look again at some of last
week's comments on abortion by Dr.
Randolph Bufano (Daily, Feb. 22) and
June Genis (Daily Feb. 24).
Re: Bufano, I couldn't agree more
with Paul Ehrlich's contention that life
is a continuum. Life is indeed present
in a line which runs from parent
through the womb to birth. But it takes
an incredible twist of logic to use this
as an argument in favor of abortion.
Why is life any less precious or more
disposable at the stage where it is the
most vulnerable?
Then we have Genis' characteriza
tion of an unborn child as a "parasite."
How convenient. Nobody likes a para
site. It equates easily with a disease, as
something to be gotten rid of. If it's a
parasite rather than a human life, then
it's very easy to eliminate. And this
characterization is not simply a matter
of semantic quibbling. It is a carefully
calculated attempt to strip the unborn
of their human identity and dignity, as
a prelude to their killing.
Abortion is nothing less than the
taking of a defenseless life. It cannot be
justified except to protect another life.
