Senior Ail-American knows what's best for him

Dave Fairbank swims for him
self.
And for Stanford.
Yet the workhorses of the Stan
ford team find the senior All -
American sprinter a tough charac
ter to understand.
He chooses how he wants to work
out daily from the routine mapped
out by head coach Jim Gaughran.
If he doesn't feel like going a pre
scribed set. he doesn't.
If he doesn't want to get up for
workout at 6:30 a.m., he stays in
bed.
Fairbank was missed at last Sun
day's 9 o'clock workout and Gaug
hran asked him where he had been.
"Same place I was just now,"
Fairbank replied. "In bed asleep."
"I have a conflict as a coach with
any swimmer," Gaughran said. "It's
hard to realize that you can't make a
person do what you want him to do.
The goal of a coach should be to
have the athlete know himself and
his physical limitations because
when he steps up on the blocks, you
can't be there.
"Though, it is hard for a coach
to admit that the athlete knows
more than he does. But once a
swimmer is self-motivated, he can
be left to make some decisions of his
own in the pool."
"I've never had a coach correct
my stroke," Fairbank said. "Many
have tried, but I don't listen. I know
what I do best and I just like to have
a coach keep me working out. At
Stanford, I've been following my
own structure of workouts."
Mind of his own
"Most everybody on the team
thinks sprinters are pri madonnas."

said junior breaststroker Stu Cor
liss. "Some people might resent the
fact that Fairbank works out less
than they do. but I don't. Sprinters
don't need to get in as many yards
as other swimmers."
"I know people resent the fact
that I don't do as much as they do,"
said Fairbank. "Right now, I'm put
ting in more work than everyone
else except Bruner and Corliss.
Bruner is a distance swimmer and
he's putting in 6000 yards and I'm
going 5000.
"I get bugged because now I'm
the one who's left in the pool when
everyone else is done with their
workouts."
"Dave really cares about swim
ming," said Marilyn Lane, his
girlfriend. "He is quiet, but I know
that swimming is one of the most
important things in his life. He has
always swum his own way and
doesn't conform to workouts. He
doesn't think other people can un
derstand him better than he under
stands himself. So he's got his own
style and programs. Now he just
needs guidance into the big meets."
Fairbank doesn't think of himself
as a motivator of the team and while
other team members will agree with
him on that point, they do feel he is
a definite inspiration to the sprin
ters.
"The sprinters worship him,"
Corliss said. "They study him."
Godlike
"I am awed by him," sophomore
sprinter Scott O'Connor admitted.
"He can do so much by his whole
mental approach to the race. He
knows his physical limitations and
does what he thinks is right to reach
them. From that point on it's all his

mental abilities.
"If I want to do something great. I
look at how Dave does it. He gives
me standards to compare to. He's
got the best start in the country, an
excellent stroke and great turns."
It is hard for Fairbank to fathom
just how good he is. He has never
compared himself to any other
swimmers. He is just always striv
ing to go faster.
Faster.
Faster.

"Fairbank is determined as hell
to break 20 seconds," said Corliss.
"He wants it so bad that it's in him
right down to the bone marrow."
No one in the history of the sport
has ever gone under 20 seconds in
the 50 yard freestyle. That has been
Fairbank's goal since freshman
year.
Peak year
He came close to breaking it
sophomore year when he went
20.18. Last year due to sickness he

didn't swim as well as he had
hoped.
In 1976, he was only named All-
Ainerican in the 50 and 100 free and
the 400 free and medley relays.
Andtie was second in thecountry
in the 50 free to USC star Joe Bot
tom.
He failed to break 20 seconds.
And he didn't make the 1976
Olyrrtpic team.
"I should've been in Montreal
last summer," Fairbank said. "I'm
the fastest in the world. That was
one of the main reasons I went to
Italy fall quarter. I wasn't swim
ming consistently. I didn't have my
heart in it.
"My ego was boosted in Italy. The
coach had read about me and was
excited to have me on his team.
There are about two sprinters in
Italy."
'Let me at 'em'
Fairbank is highly competitive.
Whereas other swimmers shy away
from their competition during the
season and want to wait until
NCAAs to meet them, Fairbank
likes to be pitted against tough ri
vals whenever possible.
"It's good to swim against the
toughest guys," he said. "In the
NCAAs I'm up against all the guys I
swim against in Pac-8 meets. And it
takes the nervousness away to have
swum against them before. Then
you're not so terrified when you get
up on the blocks."
"He's an intense competitor."
said junior backstroker lack Con
nelly. "Everytime he gets up on the
blocks he's up there to win. He
never goes into a race thinking he's
going to lose and that's inspiring to
me."

Fairbank often hides his serious
ness toward the sport. But in his
quieter moods — kicking back in
his house nestled in the hills of Por
tola Valley or standing alone star
ing into the deep blue Pacific Ocean
— he reflects back over the 18 years
of his swimming career.
"From high school up to now I've
swum year 'round," he said. "When
I've finished at the NCAAs then 1
swim in AAU meets. It's tiring and
boring.
"I'm going to take a year off after
this season. I can't see myself ever
quitting though. I'd like to stay in
shape."
Friends and teammates
Although he'd like to think he
can go for the 20 second record by
himself. Fairbank needs moral sup
port.
"Dave talks to me when he gets
down on swimming," said Marilyn.
"He doesn't like to keep his emo
tions pent up inside. So, to let off
steam he talks to me — since I don't
swim and can't tell him what he's
doing right or wrong."
"Marilyn calms me down when I
come back from workout mad at the
whole world — when 1 feel like I'd
like to form my own team — when I
don't believe I'm swimming for my
self anymore. She takes my mind off
of swimming," Fairbank said.
"It's hard. I know I swim for my
self and the Stanford team. I think
though if the team were highly
ranked everyone would be swim
ming a lot faster right now. It's all
psychological. Then they'd be
swimming for the other guys on the
team. They'd all want to go faster
for their friends. I just can't do it all
by myself."

Dave Fairbank
Senior Ail-American knows what's best for him

Dave Fairbank swims for him
self.
And for Stanford.
Yet the workhorses of the Stan
ford team find the senior All -
American sprinter a tough charac
ter to understand.
He chooses how he wants to work
out daily from the routine mapped
out by head coach Jim Gaughran.
If he doesn't feel like going a pre
scribed set. he doesn't.
If he doesn't want to get up for
workout at 6:30 a.m., he stays in
bed.
Fairbank was missed at last Sun
day's 9 o'clock workout and Gaug
hran asked him where he had been.
"Same place I was just now,"
Fairbank replied. "In bed asleep."
"I have a conflict as a coach with
any swimmer," Gaughran said. "It's
hard to realize that you can't make a
person do what you want him to do.
The goal of a coach should be to
have the athlete know himself and
his physical limitations because
when he steps up on the blocks, you
can't be there.
"Though, it is hard for a coach
to admit that the athlete knows
more than he does. But once a
swimmer is self-motivated, he can
be left to make some decisions of his
own in the pool."
"I've never had a coach correct
my stroke," Fairbank said. "Many
have tried, but I don't listen. I know
what I do best and I just like to have
a coach keep me working out. At
Stanford, I've been following my
own structure of workouts."
Mind of his own
"Most everybody on the team
thinks sprinters are pri madonnas."

said junior breaststroker Stu Cor
liss. "Some people might resent the
fact that Fairbank works out less
than they do. but I don't. Sprinters
don't need to get in as many yards
as other swimmers."
"I know people resent the fact
that I don't do as much as they do,"
said Fairbank. "Right now, I'm put
ting in more work than everyone
else except Bruner and Corliss.
Bruner is a distance swimmer and
he's putting in 6000 yards and I'm
going 5000.
"I get bugged because now I'm
the one who's left in the pool when
everyone else is done with their
workouts."
"Dave really cares about swim
ming," said Marilyn Lane, his
girlfriend. "He is quiet, but I know
that swimming is one of the most
important things in his life. He has
always swum his own way and
doesn't conform to workouts. He
doesn't think other people can un
derstand him better than he under
stands himself. So he's got his own
style and programs. Now he just
needs guidance into the big meets."
Fairbank doesn't think of himself
as a motivator of the team and while
other team members will agree with
him on that point, they do feel he is
a definite inspiration to the sprin
ters.
"The sprinters worship him,"
Corliss said. "They study him."
Godlike
"I am awed by him," sophomore
sprinter Scott O'Connor admitted.
"He can do so much by his whole
mental approach to the race. He
knows his physical limitations and
does what he thinks is right to reach
them. From that point on it's all his

mental abilities.
"If I want to do something great. I
look at how Dave does it. He gives
me standards to compare to. He's
got the best start in the country, an
excellent stroke and great turns."
It is hard for Fairbank to fathom
just how good he is. He has never
compared himself to any other
swimmers. He is just always striv
ing to go faster.
Faster.
Faster.

"Fairbank is determined as hell
to break 20 seconds," said Corliss.
"He wants it so bad that it's in him
right down to the bone marrow."
No one in the history of the sport
has ever gone under 20 seconds in
the 50 yard freestyle. That has been
Fairbank's goal since freshman
year.
Peak year
He came close to breaking it
sophomore year when he went
20.18. Last year due to sickness he

didn't swim as well as he had
hoped.
In 1976, he was only named All-
Ainerican in the 50 and 100 free and
the 400 free and medley relays.
Andtie was second in thecountry
in the 50 free to USC star Joe Bot
tom.
He failed to break 20 seconds.
And he didn't make the 1976
Olyrrtpic team.
"I should've been in Montreal
last summer," Fairbank said. "I'm
the fastest in the world. That was
one of the main reasons I went to
Italy fall quarter. I wasn't swim
ming consistently. I didn't have my
heart in it.
"My ego was boosted in Italy. The
coach had read about me and was
excited to have me on his team.
There are about two sprinters in
Italy."
'Let me at 'em'
Fairbank is highly competitive.
Whereas other swimmers shy away
from their competition during the
season and want to wait until
NCAAs to meet them, Fairbank
likes to be pitted against tough ri
vals whenever possible.
"It's good to swim against the
toughest guys," he said. "In the
NCAAs I'm up against all the guys I
swim against in Pac-8 meets. And it
takes the nervousness away to have
swum against them before. Then
you're not so terrified when you get
up on the blocks."
"He's an intense competitor."
said junior backstroker lack Con
nelly. "Everytime he gets up on the
blocks he's up there to win. He
never goes into a race thinking he's
going to lose and that's inspiring to
me."

Fairbank often hides his serious
ness toward the sport. But in his
quieter moods — kicking back in
his house nestled in the hills of Por
tola Valley or standing alone star
ing into the deep blue Pacific Ocean
— he reflects back over the 18 years
of his swimming career.
"From high school up to now I've
swum year 'round," he said. "When
I've finished at the NCAAs then 1
swim in AAU meets. It's tiring and
boring.
"I'm going to take a year off after
this season. I can't see myself ever
quitting though. I'd like to stay in
shape."
Friends and teammates
Although he'd like to think he
can go for the 20 second record by
himself. Fairbank needs moral sup
port.
"Dave talks to me when he gets
down on swimming," said Marilyn.
"He doesn't like to keep his emo
tions pent up inside. So, to let off
steam he talks to me — since I don't
swim and can't tell him what he's
doing right or wrong."
"Marilyn calms me down when I
come back from workout mad at the
whole world — when 1 feel like I'd
like to form my own team — when I
don't believe I'm swimming for my
self anymore. She takes my mind off
of swimming," Fairbank said.
"It's hard. I know I swim for my
self and the Stanford team. I think
though if the team were highly
ranked everyone would be swim
ming a lot faster right now. It's all

Dave Fairbank
Senior Ail-American knows what's best for him

Dave Fairbank swims for him
self.
And for Stanford.
Yet the workhorses of the Stan
ford team find the senior All -
American sprinter a tough charac
ter to understand.
He chooses how he wants to work
out daily from the routine mapped
out by head coach Jim Gaughran.
If he doesn't feel like going a pre
scribed set. he doesn't.
If he doesn't want to get up for
workout at 6:30 a.m., he stays in
bed.
Fairbank was missed at last Sun
day's 9 o'clock workout and Gaug
hran asked him where he had been.
"Same place I was just now,"
Fairbank replied. "In bed asleep."
"I have a conflict as a coach with
any swimmer," Gaughran said. "It's
hard to realize that you can't make a
person do what you want him to do.
The goal of a coach should be to
have the athlete know himself and
his physical limitations because
when he steps up on the blocks, you
can't be there.
"Though, it is hard for a coach
to admit that the athlete knows
more than he does. But once a
swimmer is self-motivated, he can
be left to make some decisions of his
own in the pool."
"I've never had a coach correct
my stroke," Fairbank said. "Many
have tried, but I don't listen. I know
what I do best and I just like to have
a coach keep me working out. At
Stanford, I've been following my
own structure of workouts."
Mind of his own
"Most everybody on the team
thinks sprinters are pri madonnas."

said junior breaststroker Stu Cor
liss. "Some people might resent the
fact that Fairbank works out less
than they do. but I don't. Sprinters
don't need to get in as many yards
as other swimmers."
"I know people resent the fact
that I don't do as much as they do,"
said Fairbank. "Right now, I'm put
ting in more work than everyone
else except Bruner and Corliss.
Bruner is a distance swimmer and
he's putting in 6000 yards and I'm
going 5000.
"I get bugged because now I'm
the one who's left in the pool when
everyone else is done with their
workouts."
"Dave really cares about swim
ming," said Marilyn Lane, his
girlfriend. "He is quiet, but I know
that swimming is one of the most
important things in his life. He has
always swum his own way and
doesn't conform to workouts. He
doesn't think other people can un
derstand him better than he under
stands himself. So he's got his own
style and programs. Now he just
needs guidance into the big meets."
Fairbank doesn't think of himself
as a motivator of the team and while
other team members will agree with
him on that point, they do feel he is
a definite inspiration to the sprin
ters.
"The sprinters worship him,"
Corliss said. "They study him."
Godlike
"I am awed by him," sophomore
sprinter Scott O'Connor admitted.
"He can do so much by his whole
mental approach to the race. He
knows his physical limitations and
does what he thinks is right to reach
them. From that point on it's all his

mental abilities.
"If I want to do something great. I
look at how Dave does it. He gives
me standards to compare to. He's
got the best start in the country, an
excellent stroke and great turns."
It is hard for Fairbank to fathom
just how good he is. He has never
compared himself to any other
swimmers. He is just always striv
ing to go faster.
Faster.
Faster.

"Fairbank is determined as hell
to break 20 seconds," said Corliss.
"He wants it so bad that it's in him
right down to the bone marrow."
No one in the history of the sport
has ever gone under 20 seconds in
the 50 yard freestyle. That has been
Fairbank's goal since freshman
year.
Peak year
He came close to breaking it
sophomore year when he went
20.18. Last year due to sickness he

didn't swim as well as he had
hoped.
In 1976, he was only named All-
Ainerican in the 50 and 100 free and
the 400 free and medley relays.
Andtie was second in thecountry
in the 50 free to USC star Joe Bot
tom.
He failed to break 20 seconds.
And he didn't make the 1976
Olyrrtpic team.
"I should've been in Montreal
last summer," Fairbank said. "I'm
the fastest in the world. That was
one of the main reasons I went to
Italy fall quarter. I wasn't swim
ming consistently. I didn't have my
heart in it.
"My ego was boosted in Italy. The
coach had read about me and was
excited to have me on his team.
There are about two sprinters in
Italy."
'Let me at 'em'
Fairbank is highly competitive.
Whereas other swimmers shy away
from their competition during the
season and want to wait until
NCAAs to meet them, Fairbank
likes to be pitted against tough ri
vals whenever possible.
"It's good to swim against the
toughest guys," he said. "In the
NCAAs I'm up against all the guys I
swim against in Pac-8 meets. And it
takes the nervousness away to have
swum against them before. Then
you're not so terrified when you get
up on the blocks."
"He's an intense competitor."
said junior backstroker lack Con
nelly. "Everytime he gets up on the
blocks he's up there to win. He
never goes into a race thinking he's
going to lose and that's inspiring to
me."

Fairbank often hides his serious
ness toward the sport. But in his
quieter moods — kicking back in
his house nestled in the hills of Por
tola Valley or standing alone star
ing into the deep blue Pacific Ocean
— he reflects back over the 18 years
of his swimming career.
"From high school up to now I've
swum year 'round," he said. "When
I've finished at the NCAAs then 1
swim in AAU meets. It's tiring and
boring.
"I'm going to take a year off after
this season. I can't see myself ever
quitting though. I'd like to stay in
shape."
Friends and teammates
Although he'd like to think he
can go for the 20 second record by
himself. Fairbank needs moral sup
port.
"Dave talks to me when he gets
down on swimming," said Marilyn.
"He doesn't like to keep his emo
tions pent up inside. So, to let off
steam he talks to me — since I don't
swim and can't tell him what he's
doing right or wrong."
"Marilyn calms me down when I
come back from workout mad at the
whole world — when 1 feel like I'd
like to form my own team — when I
don't believe I'm swimming for my
self anymore. She takes my mind off

tions pent up inside. So, to let off
steam he talks to me — since I don't
swim and can't tell him what he's
doing right or wrong."
"Marilyn calms me down when I
come back from workout mad at the
whole world — when 1 feel like I'd
like to form my own team — when I
don't believe I'm swimming for my
self anymore. She takes my mind off
of swimming," Fairbank said.
"It's hard. I know I swim for my
self and the Stanford team. I think
though if the team were highly
ranked everyone would be swim
ming a lot faster right now. It's all
psychological. Then they'd be
swimming for the other guys on the
team. They'd all want to go faster
for their friends. I just can't do it all
by myself."

Dave Fairbank
Senior Ail-American knows what's best for him

Dave Fairbank swims for him
self.
And for Stanford.
Yet the workhorses of the Stan
ford team find the senior All -
American sprinter a tough charac
ter to understand.
He chooses how he wants to work
out daily from the routine mapped
out by head coach Jim Gaughran.
If he doesn't feel like going a pre
scribed set. he doesn't.
If he doesn't want to get up for
workout at 6:30 a.m., he stays in
bed.
Fairbank was missed at last Sun
day's 9 o'clock workout and Gaug
hran asked him where he had been.
"Same place I was just now,"
Fairbank replied. "In bed asleep."
"I have a conflict as a coach with
any swimmer," Gaughran said. "It's
hard to realize that you can't make a
person do what you want him to do.
The goal of a coach should be to
have the athlete know himself and
his physical limitations because
when he steps up on the blocks, you
can't be there.
"Though, it is hard for a coach
to admit that the athlete knows
more than he does. But once a
swimmer is self-motivated, he can
be left to make some decisions of his
own in the pool."
"I've never had a coach correct
my stroke," Fairbank said. "Many
have tried, but I don't listen. I know
what I do best and I just like to have
a coach keep me working out. At
Stanford, I've been following my
own structure of workouts."
Mind of his own
"Most everybody on the team
thinks sprinters are pri madonnas."

said junior breaststroker Stu Cor
liss. "Some people might resent the
fact that Fairbank works out less
than they do. but I don't. Sprinters
don't need to get in as many yards
as other swimmers."
"I know people resent the fact
that I don't do as much as they do,"
said Fairbank. "Right now, I'm put
ting in more work than everyone
else except Bruner and Corliss.
Bruner is a distance swimmer and
he's putting in 6000 yards and I'm
going 5000.
"I get bugged because now I'm
the one who's left in the pool when
everyone else is done with their
workouts."
"Dave really cares about swim
ming," said Marilyn Lane, his
girlfriend. "He is quiet, but I know
that swimming is one of the most
important things in his life. He has
always swum his own way and
doesn't conform to workouts. He
doesn't think other people can un
derstand him better than he under
stands himself. So he's got his own
style and programs. Now he just
needs guidance into the big meets."
Fairbank doesn't think of himself
as a motivator of the team and while
other team members will agree with
him on that point, they do feel he is
a definite inspiration to the sprin
ters.
"The sprinters worship him,"
Corliss said. "They study him."
Godlike
"I am awed by him," sophomore
sprinter Scott O'Connor admitted.
"He can do so much by his whole
mental approach to the race. He
knows his physical limitations and
does what he thinks is right to reach
them. From that point on it's all his

mental abilities.
"If I want to do something great. I
look at how Dave does it. He gives
me standards to compare to. He's
got the best start in the country, an
excellent stroke and great turns."
It is hard for Fairbank to fathom
just how good he is. He has never
compared himself to any other
swimmers. He is just always striv
ing to go faster.
Faster.
Faster.

"Fairbank is determined as hell
to break 20 seconds," said Corliss.
"He wants it so bad that it's in him
right down to the bone marrow."
No one in the history of the sport
has ever gone under 20 seconds in
the 50 yard freestyle. That has been
Fairbank's goal since freshman
year.
Peak year
He came close to breaking it
sophomore year when he went
20.18. Last year due to sickness he

didn't swim as well as he had
hoped.
In 1976, he was only named All-
Ainerican in the 50 and 100 free and
the 400 free and medley relays.
Andtie was second in thecountry
in the 50 free to USC star Joe Bot
tom.
He failed to break 20 seconds.
And he didn't make the 1976
Olyrrtpic team.
"I should've been in Montreal
last summer," Fairbank said. "I'm
the fastest in the world. That was
one of the main reasons I went to
Italy fall quarter. I wasn't swim
ming consistently. I didn't have my
heart in it.
"My ego was boosted in Italy. The
coach had read about me and was
excited to have me on his team.
There are about two sprinters in
Italy."
'Let me at 'em'
Fairbank is highly competitive.
Whereas other swimmers shy away
from their competition during the
season and want to wait until
NCAAs to meet them, Fairbank
likes to be pitted against tough ri
vals whenever possible.
"It's good to swim against the
toughest guys," he said. "In the
NCAAs I'm up against all the guys I
swim against in Pac-8 meets. And it
takes the nervousness away to have
swum against them before. Then
you're not so terrified when you get
up on the blocks."
"He's an intense competitor."
said junior backstroker lack Con
nelly. "Everytime he gets up on the
blocks he's up there to win. He
never goes into a race thinking he's
going to lose and that's inspiring to
me."

Fairbank often hides his serious
ness toward the sport. But in his
quieter moods — kicking back in
his house nestled in the hills of Por
tola Valley or standing alone star
ing into the deep blue Pacific Ocean
— he reflects back over the 18 years
of his swimming career.
"From high school up to now I've
swum year 'round," he said. "When
I've finished at the NCAAs then 1
swim in AAU meets. It's tiring and
boring.
"I'm going to take a year off after
this season. I can't see myself ever
quitting though. I'd like to stay in
shape."
Friends and teammates
Although he'd like to think he
can go for the 20 second record by
himself. Fairbank needs moral sup
port.
"Dave talks to me when he gets
down on swimming," said Marilyn.
"He doesn't like to keep his emo
tions pent up inside. So, to let off
steam he talks to me — since I don't
swim and can't tell him what he's
doing right or wrong."
"Marilyn calms me down when I
come back from workout mad at the
whole world — when 1 feel like I'd
like to form my own team — when I
don't believe I'm swimming for my
self anymore. She takes my mind off
of swimming," Fairbank said.
"It's hard. I know I swim for my
self and the Stanford team. I think
though if the team were highly
ranked everyone would be swim
ming a lot faster right now. It's all
psychological. Then they'd be
swimming for the other guys on the
team. They'd all want to go faster
for their friends. I just can't do it all
by myself."
