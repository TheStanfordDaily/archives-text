# French House in limbo
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
After two years of success the
French House may not return next year
for lack of a resident fellow.
The house's resident fellow, Acting
Assoc. French Prof. David Brostoff.
will not return to the University next
year since his contract has not been
renewed by the French Department,
according to Prof. Alphonse luilland,
chairman of the French and Italian De
partments.
If the Row Office does not find a
French professor to replace him. there
may be no French House next year,
according to a CXDSS-R member.
Brostoff confirmed his contract was
not renewed. However, the Daily has
learned he may be hired to teach part
time next year and remain the French
House resident fellow.
Juilland said yesterday the depart
ment hopes to have someone to replace
Brostoff as an associate professor
within 48 hours.
Fill the position
He said he hoped the person would
also fill the position of French House
resident fellow.

Two proposed theme houses are
currently in search of locations, and il
a replacement for Brostoff is not found,
it is conceivable that the French House
might be converted to one of the new
theme houses, a (IOSS-R member said.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Students
Norm Robinson, who has the final re
sponsibility for the decision on C.er
man Studies house, said he has not yet
solicited any French professors to fill
Brostoff's position, since he does not
know anyone in the department. He
added he intends to contact luilland
soon.
Speaking French is the purpose —
the roison d'etre — of the house. There
is no requirement for admission, but

once there, residents must promise to
attain at least second-year proficiency
in French.
"The idea is not to luive everybody
fluent," a resident said. "The idea is to
have the learning experience."
Of course, tht;re are several fluent
French-speakers at the house — resi
dentsand visitors. "Often peoplecome
here just to hang around and talk
French," another resident said.
The house also encourages its oc
cupants to live in a French environ
ment to such a degree that some pack
up and leave for France. Seven former
house residents are there now, either
in an overseas program or on their
own.


Au revoir, maison francaise?

according to Prof. Alphonse luilland,
chairman of the French and Italian De
partments.
If the Row Office does not find a
French professor to replace him. there
may be no French House next year,
according to a CXDSS-R member.
Brostoff confirmed his contract was
not renewed. However, the Daily has
learned he may be hired to teach part
time next year and remain the French
House resident fellow.
Juilland said yesterday the depart
ment hopes to have someone to replace
Brostoff as an associate professor
within 48 hours.
Fill the position
He said he hoped the person would
also fill the position of French House
resident fellow.

Two proposed theme houses are
currently in search of locations, and il
a replacement for Brostoff is not found,
it is conceivable that the French House
might be converted to one of the new
theme houses, a (IOSS-R member said.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Students
Norm Robinson, who has the final re
sponsibility for the decision on C.er
man Studies house, said he has not yet
solicited any French professors to fill
Brostoff's position, since he does not
know anyone in the department. He
added he intends to contact luilland
soon.
Speaking French is the purpose —
the roison d'etre — of the house. There
is no requirement for admission, but

once there, residents must promise to
attain at least second-year proficiency
in French.
"The idea is not to luive everybody
fluent," a resident said. "The idea is to
have the learning experience."
Of course, tht;re are several fluent
French-speakers at the house — resi
dentsand visitors. "Often peoplecome
here just to hang around and talk
French," another resident said.
The house also encourages its oc
cupants to live in a French environ
ment to such a degree that some pack
up and leave for France. Seven former
house residents are there now, either
in an overseas program or on their
own.


Au revoir, maison francaise?
Acting Assoc. French Prof David Brostoff will not have
his contract renewed at the end of this year, so it ap
pears the French Theme House may be left without a

resident fellow. If the situation is not corrected, the popu
lar residence may be eliminated next fall, a COSS-R
member said.
