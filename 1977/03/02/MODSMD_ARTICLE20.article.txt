# Bratz' last stand
## Cards host Cal in final home game 
### David Georgette 
Back in December, if anyone
had said that going into the final
two games of the year California
would have a better record than
the Cards, you would have had
to say he was dreaming.
Dreams do come true some
times, though, and this one has.
The Bears were 2-7 before
Pac:ific-8 play began, and the
Cards were 7-3. But going into
tomorrow night's game at
Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m. (KZSU
90.1 KM), the Bears are 6-6 in the
Pac-8 action while Stanford
standsat 2-10,and 10-15 overall.
Cal had its five-game winning
streak ended last Saturday night
in Los Angeles by UCLA, 91-69.
Best basketball
"Despite their loss to UCLA,
Cal is probablay still playing the
best basketball in the conference
right now," said Card coach Dick
Dißiaso.
Should the Bears win tomor
row and then Saturday night at
Harmon Gym in Berkeley, they
will finish with a winning re
cord in Pac-8 play for the first
time since 1971.

The Cards need victories in
both games to improve upon last
year's 3-11 mark in league play.
Dißiaso said he wants "to finish
on a good note."
Pac-8 cellar
If the Cards want to avoid
finishing in the Pac-8 cellar with
USC, "we're going to have to re
turn to a desire to play good,
strong, aggressive defense," said
Dißiaso.
There are two Bears in particu
lar that Stanford will have to
play aggressive defense against.
Gene Ransom, a sophomore
5-foot-9 guard, is the team's
leading assist man and second
leading scorer. "Ransom poses
real problems because he has
tremendous quickness," said
Dißiaso. "He's a good ball
handler and he can penetrate.
We'll have to contain him."
Ransom is the only returning
starter from last season's team
which finished at 12-14. The
only other Bear on this year's
very young team who saw con
siderable action last year is 6-5,
235 forward Ray Murry. He
transferred to Cal last season

from Independence Junior Col
lege in Kansas. Murry is the
Bears' leading scorer this season,
sporting a 17 point average in
conference play.
Besides Murry and Ransom,
the Bears have two other players
scoring in double figures.
Sophomore center Tom
Schneiderjohn is averaging 12.4
points and freshman forward
Doug True is netting 11.5 in
league play.
Defense
"We're going to have to play
much, much better defensively
tostand a chanceto winagainsta
well-balanced team like Cal,"
said Dißiaso.
Stanford, like Cal, has only
one senior on its team — Mike
Bratz. The 6-2 guard is averaging
19.2 points a game this season,
tenth best in Stanford history.
Dißiaso has finally decided on
a set starting line-up over the
past few games after having gone
with different combinations ear
lier in the season because of in
juries.
Freshman 6-10 center Tom
Schmalzried has scored in dou

ble figures the past lour games,
including a career high of 15
against UCLA last week.
Fellow freshman forward, 6-6
kimberly Belton, remains one of
the Pac-B's top field goal shoot
ers, hooping 55 per cent of his
shots.
Schedule quirk
Because of the slightly erratic
conference scheduling this sea
son, the Cards and Hears are the
only two conference teams play
ing back-to-back at this time of
the season.
Last year, the first game bet
ween the two teams took place in
the middle of the season.
In that game at Maples, the
Cards roared hack in the last four
minutes of regulation to dead
lock the Bears, but then Stanford
fell in double overtime, 89-85.
In the season tinale at Harmon
Gym, the Cards triumphed,
73-65. Like Dißiaso said, a win of
two over the Bears this time
could soothe a bit the frustration
of a disappointing conference
season and give the youthful
Cardinals some confidence on
which to build for next year.

to say he was dreaming.
Dreams do come true some
times, though, and this one has.
The Bears were 2-7 before
Pac:ific-8 play began, and the
Cards were 7-3. But going into
tomorrow night's game at
Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m. (KZSU
90.1 KM), the Bears are 6-6 in the
Pac-8 action while Stanford
standsat 2-10,and 10-15 overall.
Cal had its five-game winning
streak ended last Saturday night
in Los Angeles by UCLA, 91-69.
Best basketball
"Despite their loss to UCLA,
Cal is probablay still playing the
best basketball in the conference
right now," said Card coach Dick
Dißiaso.
Should the Bears win tomor
row and then Saturday night at
Harmon Gym in Berkeley, they
will finish with a winning re
cord in Pac-8 play for the first
time since 1971.

The Cards need victories in
both games to improve upon last
year's 3-11 mark in league play.
Dißiaso said he wants "to finish
on a good note."
Pac-8 cellar
If the Cards want to avoid
finishing in the Pac-8 cellar with
USC, "we're going to have to re
turn to a desire to play good,
strong, aggressive defense," said
Dißiaso.
There are two Bears in particu
lar that Stanford will have to
play aggressive defense against.
Gene Ransom, a sophomore
5-foot-9 guard, is the team's
leading assist man and second
leading scorer. "Ransom poses
real problems because he has
tremendous quickness," said
Dißiaso. "He's a good ball
handler and he can penetrate.
We'll have to contain him."
Ransom is the only returning
starter from last season's team
which finished at 12-14. The
only other Bear on this year's
very young team who saw con
siderable action last year is 6-5,
235 forward Ray Murry. He
transferred to Cal last season

from Independence Junior Col
lege in Kansas. Murry is the
Bears' leading scorer this season,
sporting a 17 point average in
conference play.
Besides Murry and Ransom,
the Bears have two other players
scoring in double figures.
Sophomore center Tom
Schneiderjohn is averaging 12.4
points and freshman forward
Doug True is netting 11.5 in
league play.
Defense
"We're going to have to play
much, much better defensively
tostand a chanceto winagainsta
well-balanced team like Cal,"
said Dißiaso.
Stanford, like Cal, has only
one senior on its team — Mike
Bratz. The 6-2 guard is averaging
19.2 points a game this season,
tenth best in Stanford history.
Dißiaso has finally decided on
a set starting line-up over the
past few games after having gone
with different combinations ear
lier in the season because of in
juries.
Freshman 6-10 center Tom
Schmalzried has scored in dou

ble figures the past lour games,
including a career high of 15
against UCLA last week.
Fellow freshman forward, 6-6
kimberly Belton, remains one of
the Pac-B's top field goal shoot
ers, hooping 55 per cent of his
shots.
Schedule quirk
Because of the slightly erratic
conference scheduling this sea
son, the Cards and Hears are the
only two conference teams play
ing back-to-back at this time of
the season.
Last year, the first game bet
ween the two teams took place in
the middle of the season.
In that game at Maples, the
Cards roared hack in the last four
minutes of regulation to dead
lock the Bears, but then Stanford
fell in double overtime, 89-85.
In the season tinale at Harmon
Gym, the Cards triumphed,
73-65. Like Dißiaso said, a win of
two over the Bears this time
could soothe a bit the frustration
of a disappointing conference
season and give the youthful
Cardinals some confidence on
which to build for next year.

Back in December, if anyone
had said that going into the final
two games of the year California
would have a better record than
the Cards, you would have had
to say he was dreaming.
