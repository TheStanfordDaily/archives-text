# 21 Card swimmers travel to LA for tough Pac-8 competition
## 
### 
In their final competition be
fore the NCAA Championships,
Stanford's men swimmers head
for the Southern Division Pac-8
Swimming Championships
Thursday through Saturday
(March 3-5) to be h'eld at the East
Los Angeles City College
natatorium. Entered in the meet
are defending NCAA champion
USC, UCLA and California.
"For us, the Pac-8 meet is im
portant only as time-trials for the
nationals," says Stanford coach
Jim Gaughran. "We're not wor
ried about who we beat or what
the score is, we just want to qual
ify as many swimmers as possi
ble for the NCAA."
Heading the Cardinal team,
and already qualified for the
NCAA Championships (Mar.
24-26) are sophomore Olympian
Mike Bruner and senior All
- sprinter Dave Fair
bank. Junior Stu Corliss and
freshman Bob Hagberg have
qualified in the breaststroke and
butterfly events, respectively,
and the Cardinal relay teams
have posted sub-qualifying
marks in the 400 and 800 free
and 400 medley races.
Gaughran looks for freshman
Ken Shilling (breast and IM),
Paul Hartloff (distance free) and
Tom O'Brien (free and fly) to
meet NCAA standards this
weekend. "They are all close to
the times, and should be able to
qualify. It's just a matter of get
ting the right mental approach."
In 1977 dual-meet action,
Stanford defeated UOP 89-24,
and lost to UCLA 77-36, USC
81-52 and California 73-40.
