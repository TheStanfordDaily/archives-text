Carter asks for Department of Energy
Washington — President Jimmy Carter proposed
yesterday the creation of a Department of Energy to
consolidate existing federal energy agencies and to
oversee the energy policies he will announce next
month and that he hopes Congress will adopt.
The proposed new department will takeover regu
lation of oil. natural gasand electric powerand share
with the Interior Department management of oil. gas,
coal and other energy sources on federal land.
Initial congressional reactions to his plans for the
energy Cabinet post appeared favorable although
possible controversy was anticipated over two key
elements of the package.
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.) chairman of the
Senate Covernment Operations Committee which
will review the proposal, announced he would in
troduce it in the Senate and that it will be cospon
sored by a number of prominent senators including
Democratic leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.).
Carter's proposal would create a new department
with a staff of 19,767 and a fiscal 197H budget of
some $10.6 billion, absorbing entirely the present
Federal Energy Administration, the Energy Research
and Development Administration and the Federal
Power Commission.
Carter said the purpose of the proposed reorgani
zation was to "give us one governmental body with
sufficient scope and authority to do the massive job
that remains to be done" to cope with U.S. energy
needs.
lames Schlesinger, who is expected to head the
new department if it is approved by Congress, said
the consolidation would achieve greater efficiency
but not necessarily reduce the number of govern
ment employes in energy programs.
Schlesi nger said the bill was aimed at establishing
a national framework for energy policy, not the pol
icy itself.
Schlesinger said he hoped Congress would ap
prove the new department by April 19, the day be
fore Carter is to send it a package of legislative

energy policy proposals, but he recognized that this
would be a short timetable that might not be met.
New York City nearly bankrupt again
New York — President Jimmy Carter said yester
day he favors long-range federal loans to New York
City for five or six years, but he balked at promising
an immediate loan to save the city from imminent
bankruptcy.
The city, faced with the biggest threat of collapse
since it almost went bankrupt 15 months ago, last
week applied for a $255 million federal loan to see it
through March. Its first default deadline falls next
Monday, and it could face a shortage of almost $200
million by the middle of the month.
Commenting on the loan request, Carter told re
porters in Washington, "My own inclination is New
York City, state and banks will have to deal with the
long-range financial picture first and without federal
participation. We will make available a continuation
of a temporary loan. 1 would be in favor of extending
the period oftemporarv loans over five or six years."
The federal loan program extending up to $2.3
billion a year to the city was set up 15 months ago by
President Cerald Ford and is due to expire in 1978.
White House officials later said that Carter's
statement "was not referring to the current loan re
quest" fora $255 million loan thecity says it needs to
avoid going broke; in less than a week.
Carter's remarks followed a statement Monday
night by Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal
that current negotiations between banks, unions and
city officials on how to pay off $ 1 billion incity notes
must reach "a status that would permit me to ap
prove this loan."
City bookkeepers calculated yesterday that New
York will run $21 million short of cash next Monday
unless it gets outside help. The shortage will grow to
$68 million on March 11, $151 million on March 14,
and $198 million on March 15.
City Hall spokesmen said they were still studying
Carter's remarks and had no comment.

Redisricting along racial lines OK'd
Washington — State legislatures redrawing polit
ical boundaries may consider voters' race in order to
give black or other nonwhite voters a greater voice in
government, the Supreme Court said yesterday.
The high court, with only Chief Justice Warren
Burger disagreeing with its action, upheld a lower
court decision that the New York State Legislature
did not violate the Constitution when reapportion
ing state legislative districts in 1974.
State officials acknowledged that they used voters'
race as the primary consideration in the redisricting
plan. The plan was designed to assure nonwhite
voters at least a 65 per cent majority in some districts
so nonwhite candidates would have a better chance
of winning.
Proponents called the redisricting plan a form of
"affirmative action gerrymandering" while oppo
nents called it a type of "reverse discrimination."
In his dissent, Burger said that a 1960 court deci
sion found that the Constitution bars drawing politi
cal boundaries "with the sole, explicit objective of
reaching a predetermined racial result."
Burger said the racial quota system employed by
New York was an inpermissible form of racial dis
crimination.
