# Carter greets dissident at White House
## 
### 
Washington (AF) â€” President
Jimmy Carter told Soviet dissident
Vladimir Bukovsky at a White Mouse
meeting yesterday that he will not be
"timid" in his pronouncements on
human rights and that the U.S. "com
mitment to the concept of human
rights is permanent."
But Carter said he wants his public
statements on human rights to be
"productive and not counterproduc
tive."
In the face of strong Soviet protests
over Carter's human rights pro
nouncements. the president told
Bukovsky that he wanted "to assure
that our own nation and countries
other than the Soviet Union are con
stantly aware that we want to pursue
the freedom of individuals and their
right to express themselves."
Carter's 10-minute visit with
Bukovsky in the Roosevelt Room, ac
ross a hallway from *he Oval Office,
was in marked contrast with former
President Cerald Ford's refusal to meet
Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenit
syn. Ford turned down the meeting
after then-Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger warned it could endanger
Fast-West relations.
Sensitive
But the White House has been sensi
tive to the way the Bukovsky meeting
is viewed and refused to allow photo
graphers and reporters into the meet
ing for even a brief period.

Pictures were allowed, however,
during a 30-minute meeting between
Bukovsky and Vice President Walter
Mondale. Carter walked into the
Mondale-Bukovsky meeting during its
last 10 minutes.
Mondale's press secretary, A 1 Eisele,
reported on both meetings.
According to Eisele, Carter told
Bukovsky:
Commitment
"Our commitment to the concept ot
human rights is permanent and I don't
intend to be timid in my public state

ments and positions."
Bukovsky, according to Eisele, re
sponded in Russian:
"I'm extremely grateful. I under
stood the high honor being shown mi;
by my being received in the White
House and I understand that in doing
so your administration shows its re
spect for the movement which 1 repre
sent and the ideas which we stand
for."
Bukovsky. whose civil rights ac
tivities led him to spend 12 of his 34
years in Russian prisons, was released

from a Soviet jail in December.
According to Eisele, Mondale asked
Bukovsky what sustained him and his
colleagues in their fight for human
rights and the Russian said: "First and
foremost is trust, faith in people, faith
in the future and faith in the human
values for which we stand."
Eisele said Carter, entering the
Roosevelt Room, approached
Bukovsky and said: "Hi, I'm jimmy
Carter." The spokesman then said Car
ter welcomed the Russian to the Un
ited States.
