# Chilled pipe to cool University
## 
### Laura Kennedy 
Coing to Meyer Library is becoming
an exercise in trench warfare. Con
struction for Main Library addition is
already causing commotion to the
north and east of Meyer, and now a
chilled water pipe is being installed to
the south, to tin; side of the bookstore.
The chilled water pipe, to facilitate
air conditioning, will extend across
White Plaza, down Panama Street and
end near the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building, where it will complete the
chilled water loop extending around
the central campus area.
Excavation started last Tuesday and
the contractor, Power-Anderson, Inc.,

hopes to complete the job by April 8,
according to their job superintendent
Cary Larson.
The pipe should reach White Plaza
by Tuesday or Wednesday of next
week, according to Larson. Excavation
across White Plaza to the north corner
of the Old Union should take about
three days. Larson said, although the
many pipes already under the plaza
may delay the job. he added.
Heavy traffic
Because of heavy pedestrian and
bike traffic going through this area,
one-half of White Plaza will be kept
open at all times.
The trench will be backfilled as ex

cavation proceeds, and 13 foot by 5
foot metal plates will be placed over
the trench, which is about two feet
wide and 14 feet deep.
As work reaches Panama Street bet
ween Duena Street and the Mitchell
Building, the north side of the street
will be closed to traffic and parking,
according to a construction and en
gineering office press release.
The release adds that access to park
ing on Panama Street behind the Old
\ Inion may be temporarily interrupted
lor brief periods, but every effort will
be made to keep access open.

The job costs a total of $246,000,
$159,431 of which is for construction,
according to J. Hugh Turner, assistant
manager of the Construction and En
gineering Office.
The pipeline will complete the chil
led water loop, allowing water to cir
culate with better pressure for im
proved air conditioning, according to
Turner.
Tresidder Union is currently cooled
hy its own system, but Facilities En
gineer Ole Christensen explained that
air conditioning from a central system
would require less manpower and be
more efficient.
II the Board of Trustees approves tin;
I'residder project, conversion should
take place late this year or early next
year at a cost of $50,000-100,000, said
Christensen.
All other air-conditioned buildings
except the High Energy Physics Lab
have already been switched to the
central I Iniversity system, said Christ

chilled water pipe is being installed to
the south, to tin; side of the bookstore.
The chilled water pipe, to facilitate
air conditioning, will extend across
White Plaza, down Panama Street and
end near the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building, where it will complete the
chilled water loop extending around
the central campus area.
Excavation started last Tuesday and
the contractor, Power-Anderson, Inc.,

hopes to complete the job by April 8,
according to their job superintendent
Cary Larson.
The pipe should reach White Plaza
by Tuesday or Wednesday of next
week, according to Larson. Excavation
across White Plaza to the north corner
of the Old Union should take about
three days. Larson said, although the
many pipes already under the plaza
may delay the job. he added.
Heavy traffic
Because of heavy pedestrian and
bike traffic going through this area,
one-half of White Plaza will be kept
open at all times.
The trench will be backfilled as ex

cavation proceeds, and 13 foot by 5
foot metal plates will be placed over
the trench, which is about two feet
wide and 14 feet deep.
As work reaches Panama Street bet
ween Duena Street and the Mitchell
Building, the north side of the street
will be closed to traffic and parking,
according to a construction and en
gineering office press release.
The release adds that access to park
ing on Panama Street behind the Old
\ Inion may be temporarily interrupted
lor brief periods, but every effort will
be made to keep access open.

The job costs a total of $246,000,
$159,431 of which is for construction,
according to J. Hugh Turner, assistant
manager of the Construction and En
gineering Office.
The pipeline will complete the chil
led water loop, allowing water to cir
culate with better pressure for im
proved air conditioning, according to
Turner.
Tresidder Union is currently cooled
hy its own system, but Facilities En
gineer Ole Christensen explained that
air conditioning from a central system
would require less manpower and be
more efficient.
II the Board of Trustees approves tin;
I'residder project, conversion should
take place late this year or early next
year at a cost of $50,000-100,000, said
Christensen.
All other air-conditioned buildings
except the High Energy Physics Lab
have already been switched to the
central I Iniversity system, said Christ
ensen.
