Students were warned against at
tempting to "interfere with the con
duct of the University" by President
Richard Lyman, when he spoke on
KXSU's Campus Conference last
night.
Lyman was referring to a student
protest Tuesday against the way the
University was going to vote its pro
xies on .!()()() shares of LP. Stevens
stock.
At that protest, almost 60 students
occupied the office waiting room of
Robert Augsburger. vice president for
business and finance, leaving only
after they were threatened with arrest.
The protestors wanted the Univer
sity' to vote tor a resolution that asked

disclosure of Stevens wage and labor
information. The University instead
abstained. Lyman emphasized last
night that there would be no decision
making by coercion.
The University did vote for another
Stevens disclosure resolution. Lyman
said the University's actions overall
gave the demonstrators "80 to 90 per
cent of what they wanted, and they
were as disappointed as if they had
gotten nothing."
The University's actions are "as
likely to have the desired effect as if
Augsburger had done everything they
wanted." Lyman added.
"This is the first time the I Jniversity
has voted against the management."

he said.
Lyman also spoke about his trip to
Washington, U.C. last week. He said
the atmosphere at the Department ot
Health, Education and Welfare was
"receptive, lively and encouraging.
"1 feel it will he easier to get a sym
pathetic hearing," he said. "However,
the bureaucratic problems won't go
away."
Lyman also said he fears Stanford
will be seriously harmed it new laws
which regulate fundraising by charit
able organizations such as the Univer
sity are passed.
