Pat Hall submitted a letter of resig
nation yesterday as Chairman of the
ASSU senate, saving his reasons are
"personal and have nothing to do with
the political situation that exists in the
senate."
In his letter. Hall wrote. "1 do not
wish to make a statement concerning
these reasons." He could not he
reached for further comment.
"The job requires a great amount of
time and effort and a normal student is
not capable of devoting this much time
to the job," Hall said.
According to Hall's letter, krevoy
will preside over the senate meetings
until a new chairman is elected.
Hall wrote he expects the senate to
elect a new chairman at the March 7
meeting.
When electing a new chairman, Hall
added, "the senate should only con
sider those candidates who can afford

to reduce their scholarly workload and
who do not have other pressing com
mitments."
This is "a much more important fac
tor to he considered than any factor
concerning political ties or knowledge
of the rules of order," Hall wrote.
Sen. Brad Krevoy disagreed, and
said the chairman "does have to know
what's going on at the University" and
most importantly, "provide some
leadership."
Krevoy said he was "a bit surprised"
at Hall's resignation, but praised him
for being "impartial" and "able to di
vorce himself from the politicking of
Hammer & Coffin."
Krevoy also said the chairman "is
allowed to go half load, so he should
have ample time to perform his duties
to the senate. He does no more work
than the editor of the Daily or year
book, or any of the COP (Council of
Presidents) members."
