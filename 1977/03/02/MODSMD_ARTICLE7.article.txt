Red light district sen,gm
New traffic signals at the corner of El Camino Real and University
Avenue are expected to be functional sometime near the end of March
or the beginning of April. The project to improve the safety of the
heavily traveled intersection has taken six months to complete be
cause of the necessity of keeping both roads open and because
special wiring for the new signals is required.
