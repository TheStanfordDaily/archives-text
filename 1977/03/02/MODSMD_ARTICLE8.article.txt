The train pulled into Berlin on a
slushy winter morning and taxi cabs
scattered us throughout the city to our
new Berlin homes. That was the be
ginning for us of Stanford-in-Berlin,
the beginning of a multidimensional
learning experience.
We stepped off the train that morn
ing into Berlin, a city once destroyed
by a war that destroyed the men.
Mostly women remained to clean up
after World War 11, stooping down to
pick up the crumbled city chunk by
chunk and brick by brick.
Berlin's only mountain, was hand
made with that rubble.
We saw the Friedrich Wilhelm
Memorial Church that morning, a
building partially destroyed by the
war and preserved in its wreckage as a
tangible scar of the wound Berlin sur
vived.
We stepped into Berlin and felt the
scars and memories of the buildings
and people there. Old walls are still
mottled with bullet holes; old Berlin
ers still recount horror stories of the
endless nights spent hiding from air
raids.
Berlin is struggling to create and
maintain a postwar vitality, and we
saw the successful glitter of the tourist
and business district.
But the scars and memories of Berlin
are kept fresh by the infamous wall
that surrounds and divides it, the wall
that is punctuated by watch towers
and guard dogs.
Despite enticing campaigns inviting

West Germans to resetUe in Berlin, the
population dwindles steadily and the
number of elderly people remains dis
proportionately high.
The dwindling population is drain
ing the city's struggling vitality, and
now the University is deserting Berlin
too.
The misfortune of this to both Berlin
and to Stanford's undergraduate edu
cation is incalculable. As participants
of Stanford-in-Berlin 1976, we experi
enced an incomparable kaleidoscope
of impressions that led us to develop a
keen perception of Berlin as an epi
center of the arts and a microcosm of
international politics.
A year has passed since we arrived
in Berlin but our memories are clear
and poignant.
Berlin was little things to us, like
lugging baskets of coal up five flights
of stairs to stoke the coal furnace that
heated the rooms. Berlin was little old
ladies walking their dachshunds at
midnight, and Berlin was speaking
late and long with old Berliners in
neighborhood pubs about old Berlin.
Berlin was a soft morning tapestry of
cooing pigeons and distant church
bells. It was a rumble of subways and
an interweaving maze of double de
cker busses. It was smells of wursts
and kuchen and brewing coffee. It was
cobblestone sidewalks and sidestreets.
Berlin was big things to us, like
struggling to communicate in a foreign
language, becoming a member of a Ber
lin family and taking the kids to the

zoo. Berlin was Herbert von Karajan
and the Berlin Philharmonic, and
German art history from Gottlieb
Schick to Ernst Kirchner. Our days
were crowded with concerts,
museums, opera and theater.
In Berlin we felt the quiet tension
interlacing East and West. A half hour
of red tape and a few German marks
was for us the simple bridge between
the two complex worlds. In Berlin we
learned the realities of abstract
ideologies as they affect people on
both sides of the wall.
It was an intricate and invaluable
learning experience for us, a collage
woven of infinite, subtle shades, tex
tures.tones, and fragrances of this un
ique city.
The University's withdrawl from
Berlin is a blow to Berlin and a blow to
Stanford's undergraduate education.
Berlin gave us an engraved invitation
to remain, spending $400,000 to reno
vate a building for us to use rent free
for classrooms and office space.
But for lack of $75,000 on Stanford's
end, we are forced to terminate our
involvement in Berlin. While budgets
everywhere grow more cadaverous,
educational priorities must quickly be
organized and defined. As past par
ticipants of the Stanford-in-Berlin
program, we are deeply saddened and
frustrated that Berlin's value as a un
ique political and cultural learning
experience was not given the priority
we know it deserves.
