# Faculty apathy disheartening

The other day I spent the noon hour
outside the Faculty Club, together
with a student, collecting signatures
for a letter to Vice President Robert
Augsburger. The letter asked that the
University vote the 3000 shares it
holds in J.P. Stevens — a company
convicted of over 11 breaches of the
National Labor Relations Act — in
favor of two stockholder resolutions
requesting the company's compliance
with the law and disclosure of relevant
information concerning its actions and
policies. The letter was concise, mild,
polite and had already been signed by
several pillars of the Stanford faculty
not known for radical activities. It has
since received the editorial support of
the Daily, the backing of the ASSU
Council of Presidents and some 1600
signatures, and Augsburger had, in ef
fect, even then already agreed to vote
for one of the resolutions.
Not counting such unlikelv pros
pects as the director of the Hoover In
stitution or groups of faculty obviously
escorting visitors to lunch, none of
whom we even approached, we asked
about 30-35 people. It netted us two
signatures. One was that of a dean of
rather conservative bent, the other of a
member of his department who fol
lowed his conscience and his dean. In
this bold and reckless act he was, alas,

joined by no one else.
The people who eat at the Faculty
Club are, by and large, administrators
and tenured faculty. They constitute a
group that is probably more prosper
ous and secure than most in the labor
market, but their fear and trembling at
signing a letter asking for the most
minimal commitment to other
people's human rights was a wonder to
behold.
The most frequent comment was: "I
can't sign this. I don't know enough
about it" — with little visible desire for
further information. (The Daily had by
that time published three big articles
on the subject, two of them on the front
page, and the letter was, in any case,
self-explanatory.)
A very few were clearly late and in a
hurry, but several others studied the
letter long enough to commit it to
memory, then told us that they did
"not have the time to sign." One per
son actually pronounced the classic: "I
don't want to get involved," and
another told me: "1 am with you," but
refused to sign. Two or three, without
knowing what we were about, waved
us off with a "not interested" or the
sad, sympathetic head-shake with
which one wards off pencil-vendors.
One man said that, his great sym
pathy for the workers notwithstand-

ing, never would he support a disclo
sure that might jeopardize a com
pany's competitive position. Only one,
somewhat refreshingly, grew apoplec
tic and told us that this was a pro
union effort, that he loathed unions,
that there should be none and damned
if he would sign.
I suspect this view was not
shared by most of the others. But what
seemed to be reflected in many of their
faces was the anxious effort of devin
ing how their names on such a docu
ment might go down with chairman,
colleagues or administration.
I stuck it out most of the hour until
we showed the letter to one man who
read it carefully, a worried frown
growing on his face. Then he gave it
back to us and said: "I can't sign this —
I am not even here. I am an sabbatical."
For the sake of the students who
spend four years or so under the tutel
age of people like this, one can only
hope that moral habits, unlike the
mumps, are not catching. As for the
40,000 Stevens workers forced to work
under conditions of enslavement im
posed upon them, one hopes that they
will find support in their struggle from
people who have not enslaved them
selves.
