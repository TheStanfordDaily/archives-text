# Real issue in Stevens debate
##

Douglas Gamble

Vice President Robert Augsburger's public explanation
for his retusal to vote Stanford's stock in favor of a resolu
tion that J.P. Stevens & Co. furnish stockholders with infor
mation about Stevens' relations with its employes is that
some of the requested information "might be considered
detrimental to stockholders' interests."
Yet the University's Board of Trustees' own "Statement
on Investment Responsibility" outlines cases when the
University ought to ignore its general presumption in favor
of maximizing the financial return from its endowment.
The Stevens case meets those conditions.
One class of such cases is when: "1) the undesirable
social, economic, and political acts of the company in
volved are direct and substantial; 2) substantial consensus
exists in the University community on the undesirability of
t he acts or effects in question; . . . and 3) the economic costs
to the University of taking action are commensurate with
the probable effects of that action ..."
The Stevens case clearly satisfies the first two conditions:
the company's "undesirable" acts are "direct and substan
tial" (not, as Augsburger put it, merely "less than
exemplary"), and the efforts of the Stanford Committee for
Justice at J.P. Stevens demonstrated even to Augsburger
"high concern" at Stanford for the "employe issues."
It must be that the third condition is at issue, and that
Augsburger has decided that the economic cost to the Uni
versity of supporting the labor relations resolution might

cost Stanford too much money.
How could this be? Must we assume that prospective
donors to Stanford, including some of the 1600 current
students who signed a petition that the University support
the resolution, will permanently be upset by the Universi
ty's exercising its moral and social resportsibility?
Stevens' present profits are in large part the product of
illegal activity, and there is good reason to believe that its
profits in the future will decline as the boycott against
Stevens' products grows and the penalties for lawbreaking
mount.
It seems likely, then, that Augsburger's real, but publicly
unacknowledged, reason for this decision has little to do
with the Stevens case or even with protecting the Universi
ty's endowment. In fact, his concerns are local: he does not
want the University on record specifically supporting a
resolution which he fears could give the United Stanford
Employees a wedge to use in its struggles with the Univer
sity.
Whether or not Augsburger's thinking is laudable is, 1
suppose, a matter about which there will be divided opin
ion within the University community. But the debate
should continue and focus on the real issue, not the false
one of the proper interests of Stanford as a minor stockhol
der in J.P. Stevens.

Vice President Robert Augsburger's public explanation
for his retusal to vote Stanford's stock in favor of a resolu
tion that J.P. Stevens & Co. furnish stockholders with infor
mation about Stevens' relations with its employes is that
some of the requested information "might be considered
detrimental to stockholders' interests."
Yet the University's Board of Trustees' own "Statement
on Investment Responsibility" outlines cases when the
University ought to ignore its general presumption in favor
of maximizing the financial return from its endowment.
The Stevens case meets those conditions.
One class of such cases is when: "1) the undesirable
social, economic, and political acts of the company in
volved are direct and substantial; 2) substantial consensus
exists in the University community on the undesirability of
t he acts or effects in question; . . . and 3) the economic costs
to the University of taking action are commensurate with
the probable effects of that action ..."
The Stevens case clearly satisfies the first two conditions:
the company's "undesirable" acts are "direct and substan
tial" (not, as Augsburger put it, merely "less than
exemplary"), and the efforts of the Stanford Committee for
Justice at J.P. Stevens demonstrated even to Augsburger
"high concern" at Stanford for the "employe issues."
It must be that the third condition is at issue, and that
Augsburger has decided that the economic cost to the Uni
versity of supporting the labor relations resolution might

cost Stanford too much money.
How could this be? Must we assume that prospective
donors to Stanford, including some of the 1600 current
students who signed a petition that the University support
the resolution, will permanently be upset by the Universi
ty's exercising its moral and social resportsibility?
Stevens' present profits are in large part the product of
illegal activity, and there is good reason to believe that its
profits in the future will decline as the boycott against
Stevens' products grows and the penalties for lawbreaking
mount.
It seems likely, then, that Augsburger's real, but publicly
unacknowledged, reason for this decision has little to do
with the Stevens case or even with protecting the Universi
ty's endowment. In fact, his concerns are local: he does not
want the University on record specifically supporting a
resolution which he fears could give the United Stanford
Employees a wedge to use in its struggles with the Univer
sity.
Whether or not Augsburger's thinking is laudable is, 1
suppose, a matter about which there will be divided opin
ion within the University community. But the debate
should continue and focus on the real issue, not the false
one of the proper interests of Stanford as a minor stockhol
der in J.P. Stevens.
