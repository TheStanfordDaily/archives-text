# No tax reform on the horizon

### 
Tax reform for the Democratic
controlled Congress seems to have
taken a different form than most
people had hoped back in November.
The politics of old are alive and well in
the hallowed halls of Capitol Hill as
the Democratic majority last week
rammed through a $13,000 pay raise
for itself.
Popping off at self-serving con
gressmen is an age-old American
political pastime, yet the hypocrisy of
the movedefies reason. Whiletryingto
make their token $50 rebate package as
visible as possible to all Americans
and make us think the Congress is "re
ally doing something to help the
economy," Speaker of the House Tip
O'Niell and the Democratic leadership
refused to allow the pay hike motion to
go to a recorded vote.
The pay raise — 260 times greater
than the $50 rebate for the common
folk — was scheduled to take effect

automatically on Feb. 20 unless disap
proved by either the House or the Se
nate. A move by conservatives in the
Senate to block the pay increase had
already been killed, so the House was
left as the last hope of stopping the
raise.

But with the Democratic leadership
determined to avoid a roll call on the
pay grab at all costs, the issue re
mained bottled up in a House sub
committee with only three days to go
before the deadline. In a last-ditch ef
fort to get a recorded vote, Republican
leader John Rhodes of Arizona asked
for unanimous consent for the consid
eration of a disapproval measure.
But O'Niell had his troops ready. He
knew that only one vote was needed to
block unanimous consent and thus
prevent a vote. He also knew that lib
eral congressman Charles Wilson of
California had run unopposed in his
last election and could probably get
away with it. The word went to Wilson
to object and he did so, killing the last
chance to stop the raise. The outnum
bered Republicans were left with no
thing to do but condemn the Democra
tic raid on the public treasury and
trust.
Lawmakers of principle were appal
led and recoiled. Freshman senator
Harrison Schmidt (R-N.M.) said he
would turn all ofh is raise over to scho
larship funds in his home state. Con
servative COP congressman Bob
Bauman of Maryland vowed to return
his checks to the deficit-ridden federal
treasury.
Objections raised
Rep. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) now has
a suit pending before the Supreme
Court to block the automatic pay raise
for members of Congress. Rep. Phil
Crane (R-Ill.) pointed out that Con
gressional pay raises have doubled

since 1968, at the same time as the
cost-of-living has increased by about
70 per cent. Thus, he argued, they can
not be justified on the basis that
salaries should match the increase in
cost-of-living. Clearly, he said, they
exceed it by a large margin.
While making pay-increases for
themselves one of the top items on
their agenda, the Democratic leader
ship is at the same time missing oppor
tunities to provide realistic solutions
to our economic problems. Their plan,
as it now stands, is to increase federal
spending by $19 billion to stimulate
the economy rather than reducing per
sonal income taxes by $19 billion as
the GOP has proposed under a plan by
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.)
Reduce taxes
Permanent tax cuts, combined with
reduced federal spending, would not
only stimulate the private sector, but
give the working and middle classes
some of the inflationary protection
that Congress has so hurriedly voted

for itself.
Yet the Democrats remain adam
antly opposed to permanent tax cuts.
Somehow the thought of reducing the
wealth of government and putting it
back into individual hands is some
thing they cannot swallow.
Over on Pennsylvania Ave., Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's "tax reform" plan
would change the $750 personal de
duction into a credit of about $240. An
amused reporter for the Washington
Post quickly pointed out that this
meant "some 37 million taxpayers
would pay about $4 billion less and
about 30 million would pick up the tab
by paying $4 billion more." So much for
reform.
After a year of fuzziness, the "New
Spirit" the Democrats have brought to
Washington is at last beginning to
show substance. Unfortunately for us,
the spirit looks to be the same old
ghost.
