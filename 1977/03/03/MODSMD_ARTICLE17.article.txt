"Denotes that the information

Dr. Strangelove. GB/USA,
1963. (Stanford Film Society)
Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.
An absolute masterpiece of the
cinema, Kubrick's behind-the
scenes vision of the nuclear
holocaust does not stop at being
merely a devastating satire of the
military and the government.
Underneath the hilarity lies the
horror of our own society and the
monster from which it is born,
rationality. Herein lies also some
of the most proficient acting ever
captured on film, most notably
from George C. Scott, Peter Sel
lers and Sterling Hayden. So ef
fective are they in their portray
als of the minds which regulate
the world, we may find tears
amidst our laughter. (Showing
on a double-bill with Vir
idiana.)
DroleDeDrame. France, 1937.
(French Film Series.)
Directed by: Marcel Game.
* A farce concerning an author of
detective stories who is falsely
accused of murder, directed by
the man who made The Chil
dren of Paradise.
Obsession. USA, 1976. (Sunday
Flicks)
Directed by: Brian De Palma.
*A bizarre story of love, with
Cliff Robertson and Genevieve
Bujold.
On The Waterfront. USA,

-1954. (Radical Film Series)
Directed by: Elia Kazan.
An American classic, with Mar
lon Brando, in one of his most
memorable performances, as a
longshoreman whose ignorance
gives rise to his own political
consciousness. The emotional
and intellectual impact of this
film is perhaps even more perti
nent today, than when the film
was made over twenty years ago.
It becomes clear that ultimate
justice in this country is being
continually threatened by those
who are still not considered
criminal by this society.
The Producers. USA, 1968.
(Chaparral Film Series)
Directed by: Mel Brooks.
A more solid Brooks comedy
than some of his recent, genre
oriented gags. Zero Mostel and
Gene Wilder scheme to produce
an intentional failure on Broad
way for purposes of their own
monetary gains.
Spellbound. USA, 1945. (Law
School Film Society)
Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock.
*Not considered one of Hitch
cock's masterpieces, it is
nevertheless a well-respected
psychological thriller. Ingrid
Bergman assists her fellow
psychiatrist, Gregory Feck, in
uncovering a murder which
Peck believes he himself has
committed. Their search culmi
nates in the famous "dream
sequence" designed by Salvador
Dali.
Viridiana. Spain/Mexico,

1961. (Stanford Film Society)
Directed by: Luis Bunuel.
A woman on the brink of nun
nery visits her uncle's estate and
is cast into Bunuel's dream-like
world of questionable realities.
(Showing on a double-bill with
Dr. Strange Jove.)
War and Peace. Russia, 1968.
(Off-campus: New Varsity Thea
ter)
Directed by: Sergei Bondar
chuk.
Based on the famous Russian
novel, perhaps this film does not
capture every little nuance of
Tolstoy's writing as some have
suggested. Approaching the
film, then, apart from its source,
there exists a rich and remarka
bly beautiful work of art. The
Soviet Government spent
somewhere in the neighborhood
of nine figures to re-create battle
scenes of phenomenal propor
tions. Yet even more rewarding
are the more personal moments
which form a narrative of human
expression. The film offers an
exquisite cinematic experience
— it's up to you to accept it.
The Last Tycoon. USA, 1976.
(Off-campus)
Directed by: Elia Kazan
Based on an unfinished novel by
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert De
Niro plays Monroe Stahr, a
romantic, disillusioned movie
mogul whose life sits in front of
him like a film he can't quite
touch. Apart from its relation
ship to the original novel, or
even its historical authenticity of
Hollywood in the '30s, screen

writer Harold Pinterand director
Elia Kazan are inviting us into a
dream where we move in and out
of ourbelieved reality, to the less
rational, more fundamentally
emotional experiences of life.
Casanova. Italy, 1977. (Off
campus.)
Directed by Federico Fellini,
with Donald Sutherland.
Although "freely drawn" from
Casanova's autobiography. Fel
lini 's newest film is not so much
about the great lover's life, or
even a study of his personality.
Rather, it is an impressionistic,
patchwork of sequences, cast
amidst an almost surreal,
dream-like mood. A wealth of
visual expression. Cusunovo
represents a very unique style of
cinema, even for Fellini. and is
thus loaded with those wonder
ful Fellinisms.
Network. USA, 1976. (Off
campus.)
Directed by Sidney Lumet,
with Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch
and William Holden.
A kaleidoscopic, behind-the
scenes vision of a fictitious hut
all-too-real television network.
Paddy Chayefsky's intricate
scrrenplay forms an interesting
blend of satire and serious social
statement with such a subtle di
vision between the real and the
surreal that some viewers may
discredit this film as "unrealis
tic." More importantly though,
is the effect created by this com
bination of exaggeration, distor
tion and veritable reflection.

The Last Tycoon. USA, 1976.
(Off-campus)
Directed by: Elia Kazan
Based on an unfinished novel by
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert De
Niro plays Monroe Stahr, a
romantic, disillusioned movie
mogul whose life sits in front of
him like a film he can't quite
touch. Apart from its relation
ship to the original novel, or
even its historical authenticity of
Hollywood in the '30s, screen

writer Harold Pinterand director
Elia Kazan are inviting us into a
dream where we move in and out
of ourbelieved reality, to the less
rational, more fundamentally
emotional experiences of life.
Casanova. Italy, 1977. (Off
campus.)
Directed by Federico Fellini,
with Donald Sutherland.
Although "freely drawn" from
Casanova's autobiography. Fel
lini 's newest film is not so much
about the great lover's life, or
even a study of his personality.
Rather, it is an impressionistic,
patchwork of sequences, cast
amidst an almost surreal,
dream-like mood. A wealth of
visual expression. Cusunovo
represents a very unique style of
cinema, even for Fellini. and is
thus loaded with those wonder
ful Fellinisms.
Network. USA, 1976. (Off
campus.)
Directed by Sidney Lumet,
with Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch
and William Holden.
A kaleidoscopic, behind-the
scenes vision of a fictitious hut
all-too-real television network.
Paddy Chayefsky's intricate
scrrenplay forms an interesting
blend of satire and serious social
statement with such a subtle di
vision between the real and the
surreal that some viewers may
discredit this film as "unrealis
tic." More importantly though,
is the effect created by this com
bination of exaggeration, distor
tion and veritable reflection.

Dr. Strangelove. GB/USA,
1963. (Stanford Film Society)
Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.
An absolute masterpiece of the
cinema, Kubrick's behind-the
scenes vision of the nuclear
holocaust does not stop at being
merely a devastating satire of the
military and the government.
Underneath the hilarity lies the
horror of our own society and the
monster from which it is born,
rationality. Herein lies also some
of the most proficient acting ever
captured on film, most notably
from George C. Scott, Peter Sel
lers and Sterling Hayden. So ef
fective are they in their portray
als of the minds which regulate
the world, we may find tears
amidst our laughter. (Showing

DroleDeDrame. France, 1937.
(French Film Series.)
Directed by: Marcel Game.
* A farce concerning an author of
detective stories who is falsely

Directed by: Brian De Palma.
*A bizarre story of love, with
Cliff Robertson and Genevieve
Bujold.
On The Waterfront. USA,

-1954. (Radical Film Series)
Directed by: Elia Kazan.
An American classic, with Mar
lon Brando, in one of his most
memorable performances, as a
longshoreman whose ignorance
gives rise to his own political
consciousness. The emotional
and intellectual impact of this
film is perhaps even more perti
nent today, than when the film
was made over twenty years ago.
It becomes clear that ultimate
justice in this country is being
continually threatened by those
who are still not considered
criminal by this society.
The Producers. USA, 1968.
(Chaparral Film Series)
Directed by: Mel Brooks.
A more solid Brooks comedy
than some of his recent, genre
oriented gags. Zero Mostel and
Gene Wilder scheme to produce
an intentional failure on Broad
way for purposes of their own
monetary gains.
Spellbound. USA, 1945. (Law
School Film Society)
Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock.
*Not considered one of Hitch
cock's masterpieces, it is
nevertheless a well-respected
psychological thriller. Ingrid
Bergman assists her fellow
psychiatrist, Gregory Feck, in
uncovering a murder which
Peck believes he himself has
committed. Their search culmi
nates in the famous "dream
sequence" designed by Salvador
Dali.
Viridiana. Spain/Mexico,

1961. (Stanford Film Society)
Directed by: Luis Bunuel.
A woman on the brink of nun

world of questionable realities.
(Showing on a double-bill with

War and Peace. Russia, 1968.

Directed by: Sergei Bondar

Based on the famous Russian
novel, perhaps this film does not

Tolstoy's writing as some have
suggested. Approaching the
film, then, apart from its source,
there exists a rich and remarka

On The Waterfront. USA,

-1954. (Radical Film Series)
Directed by: Elia Kazan.
An American classic, with Mar
lon Brando, in one of his most
memorable performances, as a
longshoreman whose ignorance
gives rise to his own political
consciousness. The emotional
and intellectual impact of this
film is perhaps even more perti
nent today, than when the film
was made over twenty years ago.
It becomes clear that ultimate
justice in this country is being
continually threatened by those
who are still not considered
criminal by this society.
The Producers. USA, 1968.
(Chaparral Film Series)
Directed by: Mel Brooks.
A more solid Brooks comedy
than some of his recent, genre
oriented gags. Zero Mostel and
Gene Wilder scheme to produce
an intentional failure on Broad
way for purposes of their own
monetary gains.
Spellbound. USA, 1945. (Law
School Film Society)
Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock.
*Not considered one of Hitch
cock's masterpieces, it is
nevertheless a well-respected
psychological thriller. Ingrid
Bergman assists her fellow
psychiatrist, Gregory Feck, in
uncovering a murder which
Peck believes he himself has
committed. Their search culmi
nates in the famous "dream
sequence" designed by Salvador
Dali.
Viridiana. Spain/Mexico,

1961. (Stanford Film Society)
Directed by: Luis Bunuel.
A woman on the brink of nun
nery visits her uncle's estate and
is cast into Bunuel's dream-like
world of questionable realities.
(Showing on a double-bill with
Dr. Strange Jove.)
War and Peace. Russia, 1968.
(Off-campus: New Varsity Thea
ter)
Directed by: Sergei Bondar
chuk.
Based on the famous Russian
novel, perhaps this film does not
capture every little nuance of
Tolstoy's writing as some have
suggested. Approaching the
film, then, apart from its source,
there exists a rich and remarka
bly beautiful work of art. The
Soviet Government spent
somewhere in the neighborhood
of nine figures to re-create battle
scenes of phenomenal propor
tions. Yet even more rewarding
are the more personal moments
which form a narrative of human
expression. The film offers an
exquisite cinematic experience
— it's up to you to accept it.
The Last Tycoon. USA, 1976.
(Off-campus)
Directed by: Elia Kazan
Based on an unfinished novel by
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert De
Niro plays Monroe Stahr, a
romantic, disillusioned movie
mogul whose life sits in front of
him like a film he can't quite
touch. Apart from its relation
ship to the original novel, or
even its historical authenticity of
Hollywood in the '30s, screen

writer Harold Pinterand director
Elia Kazan are inviting us into a
dream where we move in and out
of ourbelieved reality, to the less
rational, more fundamentally
emotional experiences of life.
Casanova. Italy, 1977. (Off
campus.)
Directed by Federico Fellini,
with Donald Sutherland.
Although "freely drawn" from
Casanova's autobiography. Fel
lini 's newest film is not so much
about the great lover's life, or
even a study of his personality.
Rather, it is an impressionistic,
patchwork of sequences, cast
amidst an almost surreal,
dream-like mood. A wealth of
visual expression. Cusunovo
represents a very unique style of
cinema, even for Fellini. and is
thus loaded with those wonder
ful Fellinisms.
Network. USA, 1976. (Off
campus.)
Directed by Sidney Lumet,
with Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch
and William Holden.
A kaleidoscopic, behind-the
scenes vision of a fictitious hut
all-too-real television network.
Paddy Chayefsky's intricate
scrrenplay forms an interesting
blend of satire and serious social
statement with such a subtle di
vision between the real and the
surreal that some viewers may
discredit this film as "unrealis
tic." More importantly though,
is the effect created by this com
bination of exaggeration, distor
tion and veritable reflection.

Dr. Strangelove. GB/USA,
1963. (Stanford Film Society)
Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.
An absolute masterpiece of the
cinema, Kubrick's behind-the
scenes vision of the nuclear
holocaust does not stop at being
merely a devastating satire of the
military and the government.
Underneath the hilarity lies the
horror of our own society and the
monster from which it is born,
rationality. Herein lies also some
of the most proficient acting ever
captured on film, most notably
from George C. Scott, Peter Sel
lers and Sterling Hayden. So ef
fective are they in their portray
als of the minds which regulate
the world, we may find tears
amidst our laughter. (Showing
on a double-bill with Vir
idiana.)
DroleDeDrame. France, 1937.
(French Film Series.)
Directed by: Marcel Game.
* A farce concerning an author of
detective stories who is falsely
accused of murder, directed by
the man who made The Chil
dren of Paradise.
Obsession. USA, 1976. (Sunday
Flicks)
Directed by: Brian De Palma.
