# Health care cutbacks urged to reduce treatment of aliens
## 
### Karen Wada 
The growing number of illegal
aliens coming to California each year
has prompted John Larson of the
Counsel's Office for Los Angeles
County to propose cutbacks in county
elective medical care for non-
California residents.
Although a county health official
suggested the decision was based on a
state attorney general's office opinion,
the change apparently will not affect
Stanford area hospitals.
The official, who asked not to be
identified, explained county hospitals
had "treated anybody who could af
ford to pay . . . regardless of citizen
ship.
"We would never turn in any alien.
That would violate our confidentiality
with him. Besides, if we didn't treat
him. he'd have nowhere else to go. Pri
vate hospitals won't take him because
accepting his unpaid bills would be
like throwing money away."
'No legal authority'
He said the L.A. counsel had told
county hospitals they had "no legal
authority" to provide elective care for
nonresidents.
Private hospitals still have the op
tion to treat aliens, and both private
and county facilities can offer
emergency services, the official said.
According to Aaron Lohr, deputy di
rector of UCLA Medical Center and
past administrator of L,.A. County
General Hospital, the new policy will
leave aliens with three alternatives:
First, if they had the financial re
sources, they would have to go to a
private physician.
Second, if they did not have the re
sources, "thev would get no care at
all."
Third, if they received no care, the
case could develop into an emergency,
and the patient would end up at a
county hospital which would be re
quired to treat him.
"Anyone who can't get health care
anywhere else gets it here," said Leo
Smith, planning director of the Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center, a

University-affiliated teaching hospi
tal.
"We expect everyone to pay for their
treatments," Smith said. "If they can't,
we refer them to Medi-Cal or the other
government programs. . . . That's
when we find out if we're dealing with
illegal aliens."
If the aliens can pay for health care,
they are released. If they cannot pay,
they are usually turned over to the U.S.
Department of Immigration and
Naturalization, Smith explained.
Even when aliens are turned in. tax
payers usually end up paying for their
treatment. Valley Med Center has pro
vided $500,000 each year for the past
two years in medical care for illegal
aliens Smith estimated, GO per cent of
which has been paid for by taxes.
"We can't turn people away, espe
cially if they are in emergency condi
tions," he explained.
Stanford Hospital director Paul

Hoffman said his hospital does not
regularly ask patients whether they are
U.S. citizens. If illegal aliens are dis
covered, he said, they are treated only
if they can pay their bills. Otherwise,
they are referred to Valley Med Center
or the Choate Community Hospital.
Some aliens who can't pay for treat
ment areaccepted by Stanford to fulfill
an "uncompensated-care" quota
which the hospital promised when it
received federal building funds.
According to the San Francisco
region office of the U.S. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, the
Hill-Burton Act subsidizes commun
ity hospitals in return for "assurances"
that the hospitals will treat uncom
pensated c,ds'?s annually for 20 years.
The HEW spokesman said "uncom
pensated patients" include illegal
aliens and those who "fall between
government health-aid program re
quirements."

covered, he said, they are treated only
if they can pay their bills. Otherwise,
they are referred to Valley Med Center
or the Choate Community Hospital.
Some aliens who can't pay for treat
ment areaccepted by Stanford to fulfill
an "uncompensated-care" quota
which the hospital promised when it
received federal building funds.
According to the San Francisco
region office of the U.S. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, the
Hill-Burton Act subsidizes commun
ity hospitals in return for "assurances"
that the hospitals will treat uncom
pensated c,ds'?s annually for 20 years.
The HEW spokesman said "uncom
pensated patients" include illegal
aliens and those who "fall between
government health-aid program re
quirements."
The growing number of illegal
aliens coming to California each year
has prompted John Larson of the
Counsel's Office for Los Angeles
County to propose cutbacks in county
elective medical care for non-
California residents.
Although a county health official
suggested the decision was based on a
state attorney general's office opinion,
the change apparently will not affect
Stanford area hospitals.
The official, who asked not to be
identified, explained county hospitals
had "treated anybody who could af
ford to pay . . . regardless of citizen
ship.
"We would never turn in any alien.
That would violate our confidentiality
with him. Besides, if we didn't treat
him. he'd have nowhere else to go. Pri
vate hospitals won't take him because
accepting his unpaid bills would be
like throwing money away."
'No legal authority'
He said the L.A. counsel had told
county hospitals they had "no legal
authority" to provide elective care for
nonresidents.
Private hospitals still have the op
tion to treat aliens, and both private
and county facilities can offer
emergency services, the official said.
According to Aaron Lohr, deputy di
rector of UCLA Medical Center and
past administrator of L,.A. County
General Hospital, the new policy will
leave aliens with three alternatives:
First, if they had the financial re
sources, they would have to go to a
private physician.
Second, if they did not have the re
sources, "thev would get no care at
all."
Third, if they received no care, the
case could develop into an emergency,
and the patient would end up at a
county hospital which would be re
quired to treat him.
"Anyone who can't get health care
anywhere else gets it here," said Leo
Smith, planning director of the Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center, a

University-affiliated teaching hospi
tal.
"We expect everyone to pay for their
treatments," Smith said. "If they can't,
we refer them to Medi-Cal or the other
government programs. . . . That's
when we find out if we're dealing with
illegal aliens."
If the aliens can pay for health care,
they are released. If they cannot pay,
they are usually turned over to the U.S.
Department of Immigration and
Naturalization, Smith explained.
Even when aliens are turned in. tax
payers usually end up paying for their
treatment. Valley Med Center has pro
vided $500,000 each year for the past
two years in medical care for illegal
aliens Smith estimated, GO per cent of
which has been paid for by taxes.
"We can't turn people away, espe
cially if they are in emergency condi
tions," he explained.
