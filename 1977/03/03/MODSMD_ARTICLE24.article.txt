Court rules social security law unfair
Washington — The Supreme Court, further nar
rowing how government can legally discriminate
between men and women, yesterday struck down a
portion of the federal Social Security law.
A 5-4 court majority said widowers or husbands of
retired women seeking Social Security benefits can
not be required to prove they were financially de
pendent on their wives because the law makes no
such demand on women or widows in similar situa
tions.
The law fostered sex discrimination, the majority
ruled.
Justice Department attorneys, in defending the
law. had argued that striking down the proof-of
dependency requirement for men would cost $400
million a year and place "a severe burden on the
Social Security trust fund's already strained re
sources."
After the court's decision, a Social Security
spokesman said yesterday his agency was trying to
hastily draft a plan for an anticipated flood of applic
ants who had previously been turned down but who
now are eligible for benefits under the law.
Under the law in question, a man could not receive
benefits built up by his wife's working career unless
the wife supplied at least half his financial support.
Soviet tells of underground bases
Hamburg, West Germany — A Soviet pilot who
defected to the United States has told of the Russians
building phony air bases to fool satellite surveillance
while they put the real ones underground, Stern
magazine reported yesterday.
Lt. Viktor Belenko, who flew his MIG2S to Japan
last September, was also quoted as telling U.S. intel
ligence interrogators that Soviet military authorities
are plagued by severe troop morale problems that led
to numerous suicides.
Stern said its information came from a CIA report
on Belenko and quoted him as saying that so-called
"cold belts" are buried in the ground above the hid
den bases to screen them from infrared cameras

which can detect heat from troops and equipment.
The bases, housing thousands of men, are linked to
runways by tunnels as much as 30 miles long, Stern
said.
Coupled with the underground installations are
fake air bases above ground with empty buildings
and mock planes, designed to mislead Western intel
ligence, the magazine reported. Since Belenko re
vealed the existence of the fake bases, Pentagon ex
perts have identified Kl4 of them in Siberia, most
near the Chinese border.
Amin claims mercenaries advancing
Nairobi, Kenya — Uganda revived an earlier
theme in its war of nerves yesterday, claiming 2600
American, British and Israeli mercenaries were ad
vancing through Kenya toward President Idi Amin.
The report was instantly rejected by Washington,
London and Nairobi.
The government-controlled Uganda radio, said
the information came from a letter sent by an uniden
tified "group of Kenyan citizens" to the Ugandan
Defense Council.
The Kenyan government said the broadcast,
which said some Kenyans were aiding the mer
cenaries, was "completely outlandish and devoid ot
any sense."
In an unusually harsh statement, a Kenyan
spokesman said: "Hallucinations and shadow box
ing are a commonplace thing with the military re
gime in Uganda. With this understanding you can
even expect to hear that God has shaken hands with
Amin."
The U.S. State Department said the report was
"completely and totally false." In London, a Foreign
Office spokesman said: "I don't know of any mer
cenaries marching on Uganda. It's highly unlikely."
In another development, British Foreign Secretary
David Owen said the United Nations Human Rights
Commission in Geneva, after four days of close-door
meetings, has decided not to investigate violations
of human rights in Uganda. The probe had been

requested by Britain, the United States and other
Western countries.
Missionary murdered in Rhodesia
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A Spanish-born Roman
Catholic missionary has been found battered to
death, the 11th missionary to die in the past three
months in remote areas of Rhodesia where black
guerrillas are fighting the white minority govern
ment.
Right-wing members of Parliament, meanwhile,
effectively torpedoed plans by Prime Minister lan
Smith to dismantle racist laws as a forerunner to
black majority rule. It was the first major crisis in the
ruling Rhodesian Front party since it came to power
14 years ago.
A church spokesman in the midlands town of
Gwelo said the Rev. Jose Manuel Rubio Diaz, 58, who
had lived in Rhodesia for 28 years, was apparently
killed by guerrillas. His body was found Tuesday,
battered and mutilated.
About three weeks before Father Rubio disap
peared Monday, seven other white Catholic mis
sionaries were rounded up by guerrillas at the
Musami mission, 36 miles northeast of Salisbury,
marched to a lonely spot and shot to death. Four
nuns, two priests and a lay brother were slain. They
came from Germany, England and Ireland.
