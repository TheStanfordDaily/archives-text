# Court rejects suit from suspended doctor
## 
### 
Disciplinary action taken last July by
Stanford Hospital against Dr. Lawr
ence Arnstein did not violate his right
to due process of law because he has
not exhausted his administrative re
medies, according to a decision
reached this week by the Palo Alto
Superior Court.
Arnstein was suspended July 5 after
an autopsy revealed he had tied off the
wrong arteries when performing brain
surgery. The patient died two days
after the operation.
Arnstein filed suit Jan. 5, alleging
among other things in an affidavit that
"the administrative remedies to be in
voked were, in and of themselves, in
adequate from the standpoints of fair
ness and due process."
According to John Schwartz, assis
tant vice president and counsel for
medical affairs, a hearing was
scheduled for the case but "he kept
canceling out."
Schwartz said Arnstein's original
complaint asked the Court to rule that
he be reinstated, that the hospital's
suspension and appeal procedure was
unfair, that the Court should therefore
determine what hearing process
should be used and that the hospital
should use this process in his case.
Schwartz has said Arnstein's re
sponsibility for the fatal surgical error
is not being contested by either side in
the suit.
In his decision Judge Barton Phelps
said, "The court finds, that properly
interpreted, the rules of the medical
staff and allied health care staff of
Stanford University Hospital . . . are
not violative of petitioner's (Arns
tein's) right to due process of law."
Schwartz added that Arnstein con

ceded before the court his request that
he be reinstated.
Contacted at home and told of the
decision, Arnstein said the judge's de
cision outlined the rules that would be
followed in his case (the staff bylaws ol
the hospital) and that although it was
up to his lawyers, "1 would presume
that a hearing (at the hospital) would
be conducted."
