Voting location change
The polling place for the March 8
School Board Election will be Room
270 Tresidder, rather than the Wo
men's Clubhouse, as was reported in a
flyer recently mailed to Stanford vot
ers.
Correction
Yesterday's story headlined "Lyman
denounces interference" contained
several inaccuracies. In his KZSU
broadcast. President Richard Lyman
did not suggest Monday's protest in
terfered with the conduct of the Uni
versity as the story said. Lyman noted
there were no violations of t he campus
disruption policy. However, he
warned there would be problems if in
the future, students occupied build
ings which were officially closed, or
interfered with the conduct ot Uni
versity business. A story in tomorrow's
paper will outline Lyman's views on
the recent protest.
