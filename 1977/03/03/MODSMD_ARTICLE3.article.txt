# German house rejected
## 'Androgyny' approved 
### Dave Ansley 
The Androgyny theme house — de
voted to the study of sexism and a non
sexist lifestyle — has been approved
for next year. It will be located in what
is now Jordan house.
But the proposed German Studies
theme house will not be adopted next
vear.
The decisions were revealed yester
day by Norm Robinson, acting as
sociate dean of student affairs. He was
responsible for the final selection of
new theme houses.
A University committee voted
unanimously three weeks ago to re
commend approval of the German
house, but split 6-2 in favor of an An
drogyny house.
Robinson said there were "a variety
of reasons" for his accepting one and
not the other.
Gooking and cleaning
"Since Jordan house is a co-op, it
makes sense to replace it with another
one," he said. The Androgyny prop
osal had included a cooperative cook
ing and cleaning arrangement to make
it easier for residents to adopt a non
stereotyped sex role.
Robinson added that Jordan proba
bly could not meet one of the German
house's provisions — having a resi
dent fellow. "The house is small, and it
couldn't accommodate a resident fel
low," he said.
He stressed that the German Studies
house proposal has not been rejected
outright. "It will remain active, so they
don't have to go through the proceed
ings again." He said the house has
been accepted in principle, but that
there is no place to put it.
ZAP house, in the Gowell cluster,
had been recommended by the com
mittee as a possible site for a second
theme house, but Robinson said. "It
won't go into ZAP — that's for sure. I
couldn't justify taking it. It's a good
house." , r ,
I-aura Memhard, a member ot the
student group that worked on the An
drogyny proposal said her first reac
tion relief.
'Let us in'
"It's been a long not-knowing
period. We're glad the system would
let us in — for a while we were afraid it

wouldn't."
Hut she added, "We're excited, be
cause now is a chance for something to
start happening."
A SWOPSI course, "Androgyny
House," scheduled for next quarter,
will further develop a program and ac
tivities for the house. Memhard said
the students will also distribute infor
mation and organize meetings in
dorms to discuss the purposes of the
house and talk to students considering
living there.
Orrin Robinson, assistant professor
of German studies, was a leader of the
group that developed the German
house proposal.

"I'm clearly not happy with the de
cision," he said, "but I can understand
his (Norm Robinson's) reasons. ZAP is
a house that's doing fairly well, and he
didn't want to ax it," Robinson said.
Dean Robinson said the German
Studies house could still be approved
this year "if a facility became availa
ble."
La Maison Francais, now the French
theme house, may not be in operation
next year because its resident fellow
may not be re-hired. If a new resident
fellow isn't found "soon," Dean
Robinson said, he would consider re
placing the French house with the
German house.
