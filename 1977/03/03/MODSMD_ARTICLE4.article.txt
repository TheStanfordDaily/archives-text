# Police should brace for riots, panel says
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” A government
advisory group yesterday predicted
another siege of urban riots and a con
tinuing increase in terrorism. The
panel urged the nation's police forces
to step up intelligence operations and
make detailed plans for such emergen
cies.
The nation is in a period of false
calm, said a report prepared by the
Task Force on Disorders and Ter
rorism.
Initial reaction to the report was
spotty. New York Mayor Abraham
Beame said his city's police depart
ment "is always alert to detect any evi
dence of terrorism and to take effective
steps to deal with it."
The point of the panel's recommen
dations is to save lives, said Jerry Wil
son, chairman of the task force and
police chief of the District of Columbia
from 1969 to 1974.
In the 661-page report, the group of
police officials and law enforcement
specialists said police must prepare to
deal with terrorist bombings and kid
napings and a new round of disorders
similar to the urban and campus dis
turbances of the 1960s and early 19705.
The task force warned that legisla
tive proposals to restrict intelligence

gathering could deprive police of in
formation they need to stop terrorist
acts. Wilson said the task force favors
wiretapping with court warrants to
spy on potential terrorists.
Asked whether the group also sup
ports electronic surveillance against
groups thought to be planning civil
disorders, Wilson replied, "generally,
no."
The task force said police should in
clude mass arrests in the tactics to
quell riots. Wilson claimed the tactic
has not been discredited even though a
federal court awarded $12 million in
damages to 1200 persons detained by
Wilson's police during the 1971 May
Day antiwar demonstration in
Washington. The award is being ap
pealed to a higher court.
"Mass arrest is a legitimate tool with
arrest warrants," Wilson asserted at a
news conference.
New Jersey Gov. Brendan Byrne
stressed that arrests, even on a massive
scale mint be made only with proba
ble cause to believe the individuals
were committing crimes. Byrne is
chairman of the National Advisory
Committee on Criminal Justice Stan
dards and Goals. Wilson's task force is
part of the committee.
