The University's water consumption has
dropped almost 20 per cent over the past few
weeks compared to the same period a year ago,
according to Robert Mcknight, manager of
utilities.
For the four weeks ending Feb. 18. water con
sumption was 11.342 million gallons. A year ago,
consumption totaled 14.158 million gallons.
"I hope we can keep this performance up."
McKnight said.
He attributed the substantial water consump
tion reduction to widespread cooperation in the
University's water conservation efforts by stu
dents. faculty and staff.
All ornamental fountains have been shut off,
golf course and ground watering has been greatly
reduced, and residential watering has been re
stricted to alternate days between 8 a.m. and 9
a.m.
Water pressure has also been reduced and a
concentrated campaign on waste drips has be
gun.
Most of these water conservation measures de
pend largely on voluntary compliance to sue-

ceed. In order to provide an incentive for further
water conservation, McKnight said he will re
lease periodic water consumption figures.
In Columbae House, students have put cottage
cheese containers in toilets and do not flush them
as often, according to resident Randy Schutt.
"We use less water for dishes, cut back on the
length of our showers and turn off the water
when lathering," Schutt said.
Columbae residents have turned down the
water pressure, urged each other not to leave
water running, and are generally conscious of the
water shortage.
In Synergy also, containers are being used in
toilets, residents are using less water for showers
and dishes, and the garden is not being watered.
"Right now we are watering only to keep
things alive," Plant Services Director Jason
Mavis said.
"If the situation gets worse, we will go beyond
that."
"Rainfall is 50 per cent of normal," said Phil
Swain of the National Weather Service. "The re
cent snow in the Sierras and rain here was better
than nothing, but we need a lot more."
