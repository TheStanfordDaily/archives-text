# Hospital woes strike med schools

Chronic financial problems of county
health care programs are approaching a
crisis and are now threatening medical
schools.
Ties between California medical schools
and county hospitals have been largely ig
nored, despite their immediate importance,
deans of the eight California medical
schools say.
The value of county hospitals as provid
ers of medical care to the poor is indisputa
ble.
"For millions of Californians who can't
afford private health care, the county hospi
tal is the one and only available source of
comprehensive health services," said state
Sen. David Koherti (D-I.os Angeles).
Speaking before the State Assembly
Health Committee last October on behalf of
all eight California medical schools, Mel
linkoff said the deans "all join with me in
expressing our acute and profound concern
for the fate of county hospitals in Califor
nia."
Another primary concern of the deans,
however, is the interdependence of county
hospitals and medical schools.
Interdependence
"Our concern over the fate of these essen
tial resources is based on our interdepen
dent relationships with more than 2/3 of the
county hospital beds in the state," Mellin
kotf said.

All eight California medical schools are
affiliated, to a lesser or greater degree, with
county hospitals. This affiliation is respon
sible for over 2300 residencies, or 31 per
cent of the state total.
"This deserves stabilization and the ap
plication of a well-considered and firm pol
icy, rather than repeated crisis and uncer
tainty," Mellinkoff said.
In testimony before state committees, and
more recently, a meeting with Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr., the deans have attempted to draw
attention to the problem.
Yet Roberti made no mention of medical
schools' stake in county hospitals when he
introduced legislation this year to deal witty
county hospitals and Medi-Cal reform.
Service to the poor
"The whole input of the program is ser
vice to the poor." said Leo Smith, director of
planning at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center (VMC). "Education is just off on a
side, and is not considered part of the basic
problem of who is going to pay for care to
the poor.
"The fact that county hospitals are the
major subsidiaries of teaching hospitals,
and the fact that we provide a major purt of
our care through the use of medical trainees,
has not been considered."
The problem is not merely one of survival
for county hospitals, however.
"When the quality of care goes down in
county hospitals as it has to do if there is
decreasing funding for equipment, for

modernization and even now for operating
budgets, then this impacts education se
verely," said Dr. Yvonne Russell, associate
dean of the Stanford Medical School.
"In the meeting with the governor, Dr.
Mellinkoff pointed out that as the quality of
medical care decreases, then the medical
schools have to question whether they can
continue educating their students in such
poor quality of care environment," she said.
60 residencies
Stanford Medical School has around 60
residencies at VMC, in addition to a sub
stantial number of clerkships. Dr. Clayton
Rich, dean of the medical school, said that if
VMC's quality of medical care ever de
teriorated substantially, it would be "very
difficult" to teach there.
"We would strongly wish to prevent this
from happening," he said.
If Stanford's affiliation with VMC had to
be terminated, the immediate result might
be a cutback in enrollment, Rich said.
In the long run. Stanford would face the
situation all California medical schools
would face. "The prospects for the substitu
tion of other sites for these county
hospital-based residencies without massive
infusions of money and major dislocations
of existing and well functioning systems is
non existent," Mellinkoff said.
County hospitals art' equally dependent
on the medical school's According to Mel
linkoff. "Not a single large comprehensive
municipal or county hospital has for long

succeeded in providing excellent medical
care without an affiliation with a medical
school, a postgraduate medical school or its
equivalent."
University affiliation
"Most of us have had to depend more and
more on universities for medical trainees
because the American Association of Medi
cal Colleges, the part of the American Medi
cal Association Council on Education
which approves and certifies residencies,
has pushed more and more so that no in
ternships and residencies would be ap
proved unless there was a major affiliation
with a university." Smith said.
"It's a mutually desirable relationship,"
said Russell. "Some time ago county hospi
tals found they were unable toatlract physi
cians to stay in county hospitals to provide
care.
"The relationship with a university med
ical school is such that very high caliber
physicians are attracted to county hospitals
because of the academic affiliation."
"The teaching program is critical for us,
because our staff is a staff that is here to
teach, as well as take care of patients and do
research," she continued. "They are vitally
interested in teaching."
If the school lost its teaching program, it
would be unable to keep its medical staff,
she said.
The affiliation of medical schools like
Stanford with county hospitals also has

another important impact on community
service.
"In many counties and often by virtue of
their association with a medical school,
vital medical and related services are pro
vided which are unavailable elsewhere in
the community," Mellinkoff said.
Community support
In the case of VMC, "There has been very
wide community support particularly be
cause we have such specialized services
that exist in no other hospital," Russell said.
VMC's burn unit, spinal cord injury unit,
head injury unit and neonatal intensive
care unit are the only such services availa
ble in the county, said Russell.
"There was a section inserted in the Casey
bill (the legislation which established
Medi-Cal in 1905) saying that counties, if
they were to survive, had better join the
mainstream of medical care and find their
role in the total health community," Smith
said.
"VMC has done an outstanding job of as
sessing this role and providing some ser
vices to the total community which the
community recognizes as being needed and
desired," be said.
"We can do that because the teaching
programs provide us with the capability.
The level of staffing in specialty units usu
ally require around-the-clock doctors,"
which means interns and residents, he said.^y
