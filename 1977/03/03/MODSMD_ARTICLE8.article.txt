## Opinions Public should limit research 
### 
Dave Thorn

The current recombinant DNA con
troversy extends far beyond the ques
tions of costs and benefits and the var
ious estimates of risk levels which are
usually discussed. Recombinant DNA
research provides a focal point for the
increasingly important conflict bet
ween scientific autonomy and socie
ty's right to protect and govern itself.
The resolution of this conflict will
set precedents that will have tremend
ous future effects. It is vital that the
public, and not special interest groups,
set these precedents.
Incalculable risks
Recombinant DNA research is un
usual, not only in its very immediate
industrial application — Stanford and
various industries have patents pend
ing — but also in the danger of the
basic research itself to the public. The
existence of some level of danger is
universally acknowledged. Techni
cally, the risks are just not yet calcula
ble.
Emminent scientists in the field,
from professors George Wald and
Erwin Chargaff to professors Paul Berg
and David Hogness, present very diffe
rent judgments of the risks involved.
The National Institute of Health (NLH)
guidelines themselves specify as
clearly as possible the acceptable
probability levels of this danger.
1 submit that, since it is the public
who is endangered, it should be the
public who decides what levels of
risks it is willing to accept and what
degree of controi it is willing to exer
cise over the research.
Public control
There are some legal precedents for
public control over scientific research
methods. Examples are the laws aris
ing from the Nuremburg trials curtail
ing the use of human subjects for basic
research, and more recent rules out
lawing the use of fetuses in still other
research areas. Currently, the Federal
government does exercise some con
trol over DNA research through rules
governing NIH research grants and
through its power of granting patents
to the industry.
The federal government also regu
lates the use of radioactive materials
because this area of technology affects
the entire ration. However, federal
regulation of basic DNA within a
single state which does not pose a clear

and pressing danger, would certainly
be an extraordinary and possibly un
constitutional act.
Therefore the most viable approach
to public control is through state and
local responsibility for public health,
•an approach exemplified by State
Health Dept. official Marc Lappe's bill
calling for state guidelines and public
monitoring of recombinant DNA re-

search. Currently, this approach is
based on expert testimony, with min
imal input from the general public.
Informing ourselves
However, it is still possible for a
community in which the research is
taking place, such as Cambridge or
Palo Alto, to take the direct responsi
bility for its own safety.
Public participation raises the ques
tion of public capability. I believe that
science is no more "sacred" than any
other aspect of society, it has only been
isolated from the public by a gulf of
ignorance. The Cambridge Ex
perimentation Review Board de
monstrated that once this gulf is
bridged by information, intelligent
laypeople can indeed make intelligent
decisions about science's effect on the
public.
Because of recombinant DNA's
widespread potential dangers to the
public, and because such research is
directly funded by the public through
grants and tax exemptions, I believe
that the overriding concern should be
to establish public control over the
uses of recombinant DNA research. I
further believe that this control should
stem from communities, such as the
Midpeninsula, where the research is
being done.
Continuing recombinant DNA re
search essentially negates the com-

munity's right of control by creating a
nearly unstoppable inertia for continu
ing it and by forcing public considera
tion to be unnecessarily, and perhaps
disastrously rushed. A moratorium
should be called on controversial DNA
research at Stanford, as at Harvard,
until the public can make the proper
kinds of decisions.
Furthermore, to make intelligent
decisions the public must have
adequate information.
On a national level, strictly control
led research should seek to gain in
formation, to develop safer research
methods and to explore existing alter
native ways to obtain the same infor
mation without recombinant DNA
techniques.
Finally, lines should be opened
whereby the public can provide input,
through public hearings, committees
of laypeople and elected public rep
resentatives. Only then can the public
have a chance to exercise its democra
tic right to self-determination.

clearly as possible the acceptable
probability levels of this danger.

who is endangered, it should be the
public who decides what levels of
risks it is willing to accept and what

Public control
There are some legal precedents for
public control over scientific research
methods. Examples are the laws aris
ing from the Nuremburg trials curtail
ing the use of human subjects for basic
research, and more recent rules out
lawing the use of fetuses in still other
research areas. Currently, the Federal
government does exercise some con
trol over DNA research through rules
governing NIH research grants and
through its power of granting patents
to the industry.
The federal government also regu
lates the use of radioactive materials
because this area of technology affects
the entire ration. However, federal
regulation of basic DNA within a
single state which does not pose a clear

and pressing danger, would certainly
be an extraordinary and possibly un
constitutional act.
Therefore the most viable approach
to public control is through state and
local responsibility for public health,
•an approach exemplified by State
Health Dept. official Marc Lappe's bill
calling for state guidelines and public
monitoring of recombinant DNA re-

search. Currently, this approach is
based on expert testimony, with min
imal input from the general public.
Informing ourselves
However, it is still possible for a
community in which the research is
taking place, such as Cambridge or
Palo Alto, to take the direct responsi
bility for its own safety.
Public participation raises the ques
tion of public capability. I believe that
science is no more "sacred" than any
other aspect of society, it has only been
isolated from the public by a gulf of
ignorance. The Cambridge Ex
perimentation Review Board de
monstrated that once this gulf is
bridged by information, intelligent
laypeople can indeed make intelligent
decisions about science's effect on the
public.
Because of recombinant DNA's
widespread potential dangers to the
public, and because such research is
directly funded by the public through
grants and tax exemptions, I believe
that the overriding concern should be
to establish public control over the
uses of recombinant DNA research. I
further believe that this control should
stem from communities, such as the
Midpeninsula, where the research is
being done.
Continuing recombinant DNA re
search essentially negates the com-

munity's right of control by creating a
nearly unstoppable inertia for continu
ing it and by forcing public considera
tion to be unnecessarily, and perhaps
disastrously rushed. A moratorium
should be called on controversial DNA
research at Stanford, as at Harvard,
until the public can make the proper
kinds of decisions.
Furthermore, to make intelligent
decisions the public must have
adequate information.
On a national level, strictly control
led research should seek to gain in
formation, to develop safer research
methods and to explore existing alter
native ways to obtain the same infor
mation without recombinant DNA
techniques.
Finally, lines should be opened
whereby the public can provide input,
through public hearings, committees
of laypeople and elected public rep
resentatives. Only then can the public
have a chance to exercise its democra
tic right to self-determination.

The current recombinant DNA con
troversy extends far beyond the ques
tions of costs and benefits and the var
ious estimates of risk levels which are
usually discussed. Recombinant DNA
research provides a focal point for the
increasingly important conflict bet
ween scientific autonomy and socie
ty's right to protect and govern itself.
The resolution of this conflict will
set precedents that will have tremend
ous future effects. It is vital that the
public, and not special interest groups,
set these precedents.
Incalculable risks
Recombinant DNA research is un
usual, not only in its very immediate
industrial application — Stanford and
various industries have patents pend
ing — but also in the danger of the
basic research itself to the public. The
existence of some level of danger is
universally acknowledged. Techni
cally, the risks are just not yet calcula
ble.
Emminent scientists in the field,
from professors George Wald and
Erwin Chargaff to professors Paul Berg
and David Hogness, present very diffe
rent judgments of the risks involved.
The National Institute of Health (NLH)
guidelines themselves specify as
