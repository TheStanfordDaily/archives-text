# No hope for reopening of Berlin
## 
### Bill Sing 
Unless present circumstances
change there is "no possibility" the
University will reconsider its decision
to close Stanford-in-Berlin, Overseas
Studies Director Mark Mancall told the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
Mancall said that attempts have
been made to keep the Berlin program
open "at least one more year." Even
though the Berlin government would
offer generous financial terms on a per
annum basis, they wanted a contract
"for at least five years, which the Uni
versity would be unable to guarantee,"
he said.
Mancall announced last week that
Stanford-in-Berlin would be closed in
late June or early July due to cuts in the
overseas studies budget. But he said at
the time that he hoped the closing
would be only temporary.
In spite of the high popularity of the
overseas studies program, its budget
has been slashed roughly in half.
"We wanted to keep at least one
program in each major language area."
said Mancall. Given the choice bet
ween Vienna, which is well
established and popular, and Berlin,
which is relatively new, "Berlin was
the necessary choice for abandon
ment," he said.
Mancall added, however, that the
University will continue to finance its
programs in Cliveden, Tours, Paris,
Florence, Vienna, Bonn and
Salamanca within new budgetary
limitations.
Mancall said he would oppose
charging increased tuition for students
attending overseas campuses as a pos
sible remedy. The increased financial
aid such a system would require
would wipe out much of the increased
income from a higher tuition, Mancall
said.
"Because overseas studies programs
are an integral part of Stanford's un
dergraduate education program," said
Mancall, "it would be in no way
legitimate to charge more tuition (for
taking part in them)."
Tuition for overseas studies goes
into general University funds and not
directly into the overseas budget any
way, said Mancall.
Meanwhile, negotiations with
British officials over renewing the
University's contract with Stanford
in-Cliveden Eire proceeding, said Man
call. The University will make a rent
offer with the National Trust there
"within the next week or so."
