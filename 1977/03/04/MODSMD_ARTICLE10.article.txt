# University not moral leader
## 
### 
We chose to non-violently occupy
Vice President Robert Augsburger's
office in response to his complete fai
lure to justify the decision to abstain
on the J.P. Stevens stockholder resolu
tion dealing with labor relations. His
decision was made in the face of over
whelming advice to the contrary, in
cluding 1600 student signatures on a
petition (gathered in two and a half
days) and his own investment com
mission's recommendation.
Make money
A few facts became very clear during
our long talk with Augsburger.Mon
day afternoon. His sole responsibility,
he told us, was to make the most
money for the University, and he
f eared the resolution might decrease
Stevens' dividends. The fact that those
dividends are realized by illegal
means was immaterial to him. The
administration's vote was not based
on the merits of the resolution itself,
but rather on its respect for the sanc
tity of profits, its belief in the threat
of unions, and its disinterest in jus
tice.
Contrary to University claims that it
is an "educational community" and a
"moral leader," it also became clear
during the afternoon that, to the ad
ministration, Stanford is a company
like any other. It resources must be
maximized, by unjust means if neces
sary, and its product — graduates and
research — delivered to those who will
pay for them — business and govern
ment.
I.ook at the Board of Trustees and the
administration: businessmen and
business interests dominate both.
At the very end of our discussion
with him, Augsburger told us a para
ble. He spoke of a little old lady who,

when she saw him worrying over
something, told him to "leave the
judging to God." The implication was
that Stanford should only quest after
the most profitable investments and
ignore the social consequences.
This is an amoral position.
Perhaps Augsburger can leave his
moral dilemmas to divine interven
tion, but we are unable to. We take
responsibility for our lives and for
what is done by the University. That is
why we have done everything possible
to seek justice for J.P. Stevens workers.
We sat in only when we felt all other
avenues had been exhausted and when
our moral sense told us we could not
give in to this injustice.
Student coercion
President Richard Lyman has ac
cused us of being coercive. Yes, strong
student pressure does force the ad
ministration to change its policies; in
this case it brought forth the issue,
produced a "yes" vote on the affirma
tive action resolution and pressured
Augsburger into sending a letter to J.P.
Stevens management. But Lyman
should look more closely at what he
calls student "coercion." It is the ad
ministration which has the police, the
lawyers, the courts and the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC). The vast major
ity of physical force is on the side of the
administration.
Then where does the students'
power come from?
First it comes from moral force. The
University lives a lie, professing to be
one thing, while in reality it is some
thing quite different. Our willingness
to push the J.P. Stevens issue to its
limits brings the contradictions of the
University clearly into focus. This is
the classic function of civil disobedi-

Green et al.

ence.
Second comes the reality that the
people in America who make the deci
sions that govern everyone's lives,
people like the trustees, Augsburger
and Mr. J.P. Stevens, area small minor
ity compared to the rest of us. Together
we are stronger than they are — and
they know it. The problem is that many
oi the powerless don't know their po
tential strength. Controversies such as
the present one often change this.
Our "coercive" force is moral and
potential; it is not the coercion of sus
pensions, fines, jail, and policemen's
clubs. That is the province of author
ity. of the administration, and they are
welcome to it. In the long run it will
not prove strong enough.
