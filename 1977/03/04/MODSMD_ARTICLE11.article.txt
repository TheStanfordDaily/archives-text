# Humanitarianism: a conservative view
## 
### 
As a conservative in America today,
I am faced with a real dilemma. The
underlying tenet of conservatism, that
the state should not inhibit the indi
vidual's efforts to achieve to his fullest
capacity, is opposed to the increas
ingly mass-oriented government aid
programs which are designed to re
lieve the poverty, sickness and suffer
ing in America. It would certainly be
easier to compromise my views and
permit government to deal with these
social problems. But any governmen
tal cure for social ills inherently dep
rives the rights of the individual.
Therefore, I and my fellow conserva
tives lay the responsibility for the
maintenance of proper standard of a
living in America on private institu
tions.
Ignored suffering
There are those conservatives who
disagree with this thesis. They either
prefer to ignore that suffering does
exist as a consequence of these social
ills or they condemn that suffering.
That is, they argue that their families
made it by the sweat of their brows and
therefore, other people can make it.
Others who cannot or do not make it
are not trying hard enough.
The reality, however, is that people
do not live ina vacuum: factors beyond
the individual's control often lead to
sickness, illiteracy and the problems
of old age. There are people in the
world who have a moral claim to being
taken care of by those who have had
the good fortune not to be afflicted.
Therefore, families, religions, en
counter groups, universities, flying
clubs and the like must all take the
responsibility for their own members.
In this way, the necessary infringe
ment on individuals' rights which
comes with any form of aid is provided

by people witFi a common interest
rather than by an impersonal, disin
terested government agency.
The advantage of calling on private
institutions to deal with social ills is
that the members of society need no
longer be overwhelmed by all of the
suffering with which they are inun
dated daily by the media. The limits of
their responsibility to society are de
fined by their membership in private
institutions.
Family responsibility
Take, for example, a family. If family
members look to each other in times of

need, the individual family members
know exactly whose weluue they axe
responsible for and conversely who to
look to for their own welfare. They are
not left floundering in desperation,
forced to turn to an impersonal outside
source for welfare.
Religions have traditionally banded
together in part in an effort to provide
some sort of social organization of
mutual dependence and concern for
their members. The Judeo-Christian
tradition certainly demonstrates this
institutional function. The most vivid
example today of religious concern for
believers is the Mormons, whose re
sponsibility is to care for their own.
Perhaps because of increased de
pendence on the government to fulfill

the social needs of Americans or
perhaps as a cause of it, Americans
have become less group-oriented.
They thus have lost the protections of
their rights which are the result of pri
vate social welfare. The government
has,therefore, in taking the place of
many private institutions, become
guilty of depriving the rights of those
who it aids.
But the American political system
was based on the concept of balancing
group interests, not caring for each

citizen's welfare. It was through the
competing advocacy of the many in
terest groups that the individual's
rights are best preserved from intru
sion by government. It was the in
tended role of the government to pro
tect and defend the common ground
on which the many interests of Ameri
cans stood; it was not the role of gov
ernment to take the place of private
institutional social concern.
