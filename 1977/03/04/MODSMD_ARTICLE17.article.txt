### 
Sacramento(AP) â€”Atty. Gen.
Evelle Younger yesterday made
public a Catholic bishop's letter
asserting that Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr.'s nominee for Chief
Justice of California is "vindic
tive" and possesses "questiona
ble emotional stability".
Bishop Roger Mahony of
Fresno confirmed last month
that he had written a letter about
Rose Bird to the chief of the
Commission on Judicial Ap
pointments, of which Younger is
a member, but Mahony had re
fused to discuss its contents.
Mahony was not immediately
available for comment after
Younger released copies of his
letter. He was first chairman of
the Agricultural Labor Relations
Board, which was created by
legislation drafted by Ms. Bird in
her role as secretary of Agricul
ture and Services.
Younger, a Republican who
has said he expects to run for
governor against Brown, said
there were no political motives
in his release of the letter, and
said the action is a favor to Ms.
Bird.
"Parts of Bishop Mahony's let
ter have been in every news
paper in the state. 1 think the per

son who would be most ap
preciative of getting a copy of
that letter and having it made
public is Rose Bird, so she now
knows what's in it, and she can
now respond to it."
Mahony's letter said: "My op
position to her appointment as
Chief Justice centers on her ques
tionable emotional stability and
her vindictive approach to deal
ing with all persons under her
authority.
"I experienced personally her
vindictiveness on many occa
sions when the ALRB, an inde
pendent state agency, chose to
pursue a course other than that
desired by Ms. Bird.
"She has a personal tempra
ment which enables her to lash
out at people who do not agree
with her. Her normal approach is
to become vindictive, then to
transfer her feelings to a long
phase of non-communication,"
Mahony wrote.
Ms. Bird said she had not pre
viously seen the Mahony letter,
and that she didn't believp
Mahony had made the remarks
attributed to him until she read
the copy which Younger sent her
at the same time he made it in
public.
