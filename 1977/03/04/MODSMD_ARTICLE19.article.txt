# A 						look at the ‘profits’ of White Plaza
## 
### Karen Komen 
The spirit of capitalism runs
deep here.
The Graduate School of Busi
ness is the best in the land and
Hoover Institution houses many
of today's front line "soldiers" in
the ideological battle against
communism.
And then there are the White
Plaza vendors.
"It'sthe money that brings us
out here," says Steve, a young,
turbanned devotee of kundalini
Yoga. "We usually just do the
craft show and art market circuit,
but we heard that Stanford was a
good place to sell, so here we
are."
On a sunny day, White Plaza
takes on the trappings of a small
bazaar. The weather's been nice
lately, so merchants have been
out en masse.
They sell fruit, trinkets, Peru
vian natural-wood shirts, used
records and flowers. The smell
of musk hangs heavy over the
plaza when the incense woman
sets up shop.
Some of the vendors are rain or
shine regulars. Others aren't.
Steve and his bearded room
mate Eric have been working the
campus for the past three weeks,
selling macrame chokers. Steve
is a former student from UC-
Santa Cruz, while Eric, who is 36
and a native of New York, used
to run a bar and disco in San
Francisco.

While the pair hold psychic
healiog and massage
sessions in
their home and sell natural vit
amins on the side, proceeds from
the necklaces arc the main
source ol income.
Eric first became interested in
Kundalini Yoga two years ago,
because he "enjoyed the discip
line; it kept my idecentered. The
type of yoga that we do is ex
tremely intensive, much more so
than Hatha yoga or ,my of the
other variations.
They seem to be enjoying the
atmosphere at Stanford. "People
have been friendly, but so far we
haven't really socialized or had
any deep discussions with any
one," Eric said. I heir long-term
goal is to "turn people on to yoga
and the positive benefits that it
can have on your life." They
plan to do this by opening their
house for a series ot classes on
yoga and massage techniques,
Right now, selling in White
Plaza is just a way to pay the rent.
For the Flower Man, Larry
Tarquinio, hawking his wares in
White Plaza has been a way of
life for the past four years. He
started out working with flowers
by helping a friend with his
plant store until, he says, he
"discovered Stanford" and the
large demand for flowers that
exists here.
Apparently, that market is a
pretty lucrative one, since the
Flower Man said he grossed

$10,001) last year.
Tarquinio is a native ol Oak
land and attended San Jose State
for about fouryears, intending to
be a social worker. He decided
that social work involved too
much "clerical bullshit," how
ever, and that he would rather be
his own boss.
"I really like being outdoors
all day,"he says,"and I have a
tremendous amount of energy,
which is what this job requires."
His hours in White F J laza average
out to about 60 a week, 20
hours less than last year's
schedule.
During a typical week, he's up
at six every morning, at which
time he goes into San Mateo to
buy his flowers. Twice a week,
though, he's out of the house by
2 a.m. and on his way into S.F. to
make purchases at a wholesale
market there. He marks up the
price of his flowers by about 50
per cent, which, after overhead
is deducted, leaves him with a 30
per cent profit margin.
As for the people that make up
his clientele: "The people are the
most rewarding part of this job.
Stanford has a kind of small
town atmosphere to it. The
people are all open and suppor
tive. About 10 per cent of the
people that 1 come in contact
with are bitchy, and try to make
sure that they're getting their
every penny's worth. But most of
these people are not students."

The main pitfall to his job is
the weather and his location on
the circle. In order to give his
flowers the optimum protection,
he's forced to locate his table in
the shade, which is about 20 de
grees lower than the area out in
the sun.
"I wish that we could have our
old location back on the patio
under the shelter of Tresidder's
roof," Tranquino said. "Some
times it gets really miserable out
here with the wind and the cold.
Right now l have on two sweat
ers. two shirts, and a pair of
long-johns."
Pancho, a burly, bearded man
in his late 30s, is another
member of the White Plaza
crowd. He might not be easily
recognizable since he doesn't ac
tually sell anything; however,

his massive black dog, Berdoo,
has certainly made his presence
known to people who frequent
the area around Tresidder.
He has a slightly more critical
view of the students around
Stanford than most of the ven
ders who frequent the plaza.
"Stanford students are a mic
rocosm of the middle class,"
Pancho says. "Less than 10 per
cent of them are motivators or
really creative thinkers. This
place is just like a country club.
A bunch of rich kids running
around who have everything
they've ever wanted just handed
to them. They're being groomed
to be the elites in our system, but
they don't know what the real
world is like. They just lead a
story-book existence."
