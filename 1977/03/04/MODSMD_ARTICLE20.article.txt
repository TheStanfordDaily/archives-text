# Looking for a place to take a date or just hang out?

The French word "bistro"
means "truckstop" in En
glish. And that is what Le Bis
tro on California Street in
Falo Alto is — a casual place
to relax with a few drinks and
to hang out. The walls are
plastered with lively French
travel posters in the some
what frantic Bohemian at
mosphere.
Most complete dinners are
in the $4-5 range and include
such French country dishes
as beef bourgignon and beef
tongue. At $6.75, l'entrecote
bordelaise (steak) is available.
Dinners come with bread,
salad, custard for dessert and
coffee or tea. Onion soup, es
cargots, salads, clafoutis and
cheeses are a la carte. For
those who want a light meal.
Marcel's Flatter comes with
soup du jour, salad and
cheese.
A large-portioned ap
petizer, terrine du chef, is a

pungent pate, a coarse blend
ing of liver and herbs. Mold,
however, was found jn its
underside. The house salad
was warm, wilted and
drenched in oil.
Civit de lapin ($4.75), an
entree consisting of pieces of
rabbit in a wine sauce, was a
little stringy. A rice pilaf and
some lukewarm cabbage ac
companied this dish.
The commendable Coq au
Vin ($4.50) is a generous serv
ing of chicken cooked in a
wine sauce. This was one of
the best dishes the restaurant
offered for the chicken re
tained its moisture.
A light custard provided an
adequate end to the meal.
For an establishment of this
size, the wine list is fairly
long; price increases on the
foreign bottles are not exor
bitant, although most people
seem to order a carafe of the
house wine. The aperitif and
drink list is extensive. Le Bis

tro also serves Expresso and
Capuccino.
Although the food is only
passable, Le Bistro affords an
opportunity to get a taste of
France in both its food and its
atmosphere — and at a
reasonable price. If you are
tired of chewing the fat at the
Coffee House or the Oasis,
park your truck at Le Bistro.

It looks like a mundane

Le Bistro is a cozy little cafe in Palo Alto. Its
atmosphere is "Bohemian.'' The surroundings
offer a nice break from the Coffee House or the
Oasis. Gypsy Cellar has a nice atmosphere, too.
With a roving violinist who treats you just as
though you arrived from the "old country," it is a
good place to take a date.

storefront outside, but hidden
inside is a dark gypsy caravan
with candlelit tables and live
romantic music. The Gypsy
Cellar is an intimate restaur
ant in Redwood City, is not
dressy and is a good place to
take a date.
Convincing appointments
such as designed napkins,
fresh flowers, a scroll-type
menu and wooden posts
holding up colorful fabrics

that form a tent all contribute
to the restaurant's ambiance.
The violinist, John Novak,
used to play with the San
Francisco Symphony. He
takes requests and greets
everyone at each table as if he
were from the old country.
Complete dinners range
from $4.50 for stuffed cab
bage to $7.85 for a steak.
Served with the entree are
sourdough bread, and choice

of soup or salad, coffee or tea,
ice cream or egg custard.
Other entrees also reflect
the cooking of Eastern
Europe; goulashes, pork
chops, veal cutlets and skew
ers ($6.50). A la carte is $1.25
less. Marinated herring ($2)
and chopped chicken liver
are available as appetizers.
The wine list, although li
mited, does include some
imported Czech beers.
The Hungarian goulash
soup is a hearty melange of
beef and potatoes, but it ar
rived lukewarm. The more
satisfying beef soup with beef
dumplings is a flavorfully
strong consome with meat
balls.
Two salads are listed at the
Gypsy Cellar. One is a regular
mixed salad with cabbage
and iceberg lettuce; the other
is a small-portioned but
pleasing cucumber salad
in a light marinade with on
ions. The Beef Goulash

($6.25), beef chunks in a thick
paprika sauce, was slightly
tough. It is served wih choice
of potatoes, dumplings or
spetzel (fried noodles). Excel
lent carrots were cooked al
dente (to the tooth) and ac
companied with entree.
A standout dish is the
Chicken's Thieves Special
($5.50), half a chicken in a
rich sour cream paprika
sauce.
Both entries are served
generously, and with salad,
would more than satisfy most
appetites. But if you can find
room for dessert, the Rolen
chenka ($1.75) makes for a
toothsome finale. Two cre
pes, although too thick and a
little soggy, are filled with
either apricot or cheese and
cinnamon, and smothered in
real whipped cream. When
available, the Czech Date
Tarte is delightful.

Le Bistro is a cozy little cafe in Palo Alto. Its
atmosphere is "Bohemian.'' The surroundings
offer a nice break from the Coffee House or the
Oasis. Gypsy Cellar has a nice atmosphere, too.
With a roving violinist who treats you just as
though you arrived from the "old country," it is a
good place to take a date.

storefront outside, but hidden
inside is a dark gypsy caravan
with candlelit tables and live
romantic music. The Gypsy
Cellar is an intimate restaur
ant in Redwood City, is not
dressy and is a good place to
take a date.
Convincing appointments
such as designed napkins,
fresh flowers, a scroll-type
menu and wooden posts
holding up colorful fabrics

that form a tent all contribute
to the restaurant's ambiance.
The violinist, John Novak,
used to play with the San
Francisco Symphony. He
takes requests and greets
everyone at each table as if he
were from the old country.
Complete dinners range
from $4.50 for stuffed cab
bage to $7.85 for a steak.
Served with the entree are
sourdough bread, and choice

of soup or salad, coffee or tea,
ice cream or egg custard.
Other entrees also reflect
the cooking of Eastern
Europe; goulashes, pork
chops, veal cutlets and skew
ers ($6.50). A la carte is $1.25
less. Marinated herring ($2)
and chopped chicken liver
are available as appetizers.
The wine list, although li
mited, does include some
imported Czech beers.
The Hungarian goulash
soup is a hearty melange of
beef and potatoes, but it ar
rived lukewarm. The more
satisfying beef soup with beef
dumplings is a flavorfully
strong consome with meat
balls.
Two salads are listed at the
Gypsy Cellar. One is a regular
mixed salad with cabbage
and iceberg lettuce; the other
is a small-portioned but
pleasing cucumber salad
in a light marinade with on
ions. The Beef Goulash

($6.25), beef chunks in a thick
paprika sauce, was slightly
tough. It is served wih choice
of potatoes, dumplings or
spetzel (fried noodles). Excel
lent carrots were cooked al
dente (to the tooth) and ac
companied with entree.
A standout dish is the
Chicken's Thieves Special
($5.50), half a chicken in a
rich sour cream paprika
sauce.
Both entries are served
generously, and with salad,
would more than satisfy most
appetites. But if you can find
room for dessert, the Rolen
chenka ($1.75) makes for a
toothsome finale. Two cre
pes, although too thick and a
little soggy, are filled with
either apricot or cheese and
cinnamon, and smothered in
real whipped cream. When
available, the Czech Date
Tarte is delightful.
The French word "bistro"
means "truckstop" in En
glish. And that is what Le Bis
tro on California Street in
Falo Alto is — a casual place
to relax with a few drinks and
to hang out. The walls are
plastered with lively French
travel posters in the some
what frantic Bohemian at
mosphere.
Most complete dinners are
in the $4-5 range and include
such French country dishes
as beef bourgignon and beef
tongue. At $6.75, l'entrecote
bordelaise (steak) is available.
Dinners come with bread,
salad, custard for dessert and
coffee or tea. Onion soup, es
cargots, salads, clafoutis and
cheeses are a la carte. For
those who want a light meal.
Marcel's Flatter comes with
soup du jour, salad and
cheese.
A large-portioned ap
petizer, terrine du chef, is a

pungent pate, a coarse blend
ing of liver and herbs. Mold,
however, was found jn its

reasonable price. If you are
tired of chewing the fat at the
Coffee House or the Oasis,
park your truck at Le Bistro.

It looks like a mundane

Le Bistro is a cozy little cafe in Palo Alto. Its
atmosphere is "Bohemian.'' The surroundings
offer a nice break from the Coffee House or the
Oasis. Gypsy Cellar has a nice atmosphere, too.
With a roving violinist who treats you just as
though you arrived from the "old country," it is a
good place to take a date.

storefront outside, but hidden
inside is a dark gypsy caravan
with candlelit tables and live
romantic music. The Gypsy
Cellar is an intimate restaur
ant in Redwood City, is not
dressy and is a good place to
take a date.
Convincing appointments
such as designed napkins,
fresh flowers, a scroll-type
menu and wooden posts
holding up colorful fabrics

that form a tent all contribute
to the restaurant's ambiance.
The violinist, John Novak,
used to play with the San
Francisco Symphony. He
takes requests and greets
everyone at each table as if he
were from the old country.
Complete dinners range
from $4.50 for stuffed cab
bage to $7.85 for a steak.
Served with the entree are
sourdough bread, and choice

of soup or salad, coffee or tea,
ice cream or egg custard.
Other entrees also reflect
the cooking of Eastern
Europe; goulashes, pork
chops, veal cutlets and skew
ers ($6.50). A la carte is $1.25
less. Marinated herring ($2)
and chopped chicken liver
are available as appetizers.
The wine list, although li
mited, does include some
imported Czech beers.
The Hungarian goulash
soup is a hearty melange of
beef and potatoes, but it ar
rived lukewarm. The more
satisfying beef soup with beef
dumplings is a flavorfully
strong consome with meat
balls.
Two salads are listed at the
Gypsy Cellar. One is a regular
mixed salad with cabbage
and iceberg lettuce; the other
is a small-portioned but
pleasing cucumber salad
in a light marinade with on
ions. The Beef Goulash

($6.25), beef chunks in a thick
paprika sauce, was slightly
tough. It is served wih choice
of potatoes, dumplings or
spetzel (fried noodles). Excel
lent carrots were cooked al
dente (to the tooth) and ac
companied with entree.
A standout dish is the
Chicken's Thieves Special
($5.50), half a chicken in a
rich sour cream paprika
sauce.
Both entries are served
generously, and with salad,
would more than satisfy most
appetites. But if you can find
room for dessert, the Rolen
chenka ($1.75) makes for a
toothsome finale. Two cre
pes, although too thick and a
little soggy, are filled with
either apricot or cheese and
cinnamon, and smothered in
real whipped cream. When
available, the Czech Date
Tarte is delightful.
