### David Georgette 
It was like Henry Aaron hit
ting a home run in his last time
up in Atlanta or Johnny Unitas
throwing a touchdown pass on
his last play in Baltimore.
Playing his final game last
night at Maples Paviliorr before
an emotional crowd, senior
guard Mike Bratz scored 24
points and passed oft for six as
sists in leading Stanford to a
85-66 thrashing of California.
Both teams now have identical
11-15 season marks going into
tomorrow night's game.
With his 24 points, Bratz be
came the second player in Stan
ford basketball history to score
500 points in a season. Guard
Claude Terry did it twice in his
career.
"I was pretty excited," said
Bratz. "It's pretty important to
win the last one. I'll always re
member it."
500 points
Bratz said that during the
game he had not been aware of
getting his 500 th point.
Bratz took charge in the be
ginning of the second half, scor
ing two of his 11 field goals as
the Cards stretched a six-point
halftime advantage to a 46-35
edge.
"We got in the lead and we
could do what we wanted," said
Bratz.
The Bears cut the lead to a
couple of baskets twice in the
next seven minutes, but Cal
never got closer than four points
the rest of the game.
Stanford broke the game open

for good with lay-ins by Bratz
and Wolfe Perry, who finished
with 18 points, with about six
minutes to go. The Cards then
canned seven of eight free
throws over the next minute
and-a-half to take a 7-60 lead
with just under four minutes to
go.
Cal's 66 points were a big im
provement defensively for Stan
ford after the Cards had allowed
over 100 in their two games in
Los Angeles last week. "The
players were a little more ag
gressive in the zone," said Card
coach Dick Dißiaso. "Our
players practiced very hard on
defense this week. Our pride was
hurt last week."
Cal shot 39 per cent from the
floor. "When we got good shots,
they weren't going in," said Bear
coach Dick Edwards. "We didn't
do a good job on the offensive
boards."
P'orward Ray Murry led the
Bears offensively with 18 points.
Guard Gene Ransom, the Bears'
second-leading scorer, was held
to just two points. He was ham
pered by early foul trouble and
played barely half the game.
'Better defense'
"Our defense was a lot better,"
said Bratz. "They were forcing
up shots."
The Cards also got a strong
performance out of their front
court. Jeff McHugh came off the
bench to can 16 points, includ
ing 10 in the first half, and Kim
berly Belton came up with 15
points, including three slam
dunks.

"Stanford played awfully
well," said Edwards. "They beat
us in every department ... of
fense, defense, boards, you name
it."
Cal did beat the Cards in one
department — turnovers. The
Bears had 21 turnovers, 15 in the
first half, to Stanford's game
total of 17.
'Slow start'
In the last 10 minutes of the
first half, the Cards came alive
after a slow start to come away
with a 37-31 halftime lead.
Cal turned the ball over four
out of five times down the floor
midway through the half. The
Cards took their first lead of the
game at 15-14 on a 20-footer by
Bratz with 9:48 left in the half.
Four minutes later, the Cardi
nals' pressure defense forced
two Bear turnovers and Stanford
scored eight straight to grab a
29-21 advantage.
In other Pacific-8 action last
night, Rocky Smith scored 32
points to lead Oregon State to a

78-73 victory over Oregon at
Mac Court.
Washington got past
Washington State 66-52.
