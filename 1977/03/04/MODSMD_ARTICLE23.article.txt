# Tracksters host Fresno State
## 
### 
Stanford's track team, coming off a good showing against NCAA
contender San Jose State last week, hosts Fresno State tomorrow
afternoon at 1:15 in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards will give away 15 points even before the meet begins.
Stanford doesn't have any entries in the hammer or pole vault.
Card coach Payton Jordan expects a close meet against a Bulldog
squad he labels "one of the best Fresno State teams we've seen,"
Jordan said. "They have more depth and quality people this year.

"There's no question that this
will be a close meet. Both teams
have quality people and are
evenly matched. How the depth
of the two teams balances out
will determine the outcome of
the meet."
Fresno opened its season last
week with a 115-1/3 — 47-2/3
victory over Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo.
Stanford dominated the
sprints last week against San
Jose State. The Spartans, who
have a shot at the NCAA crown
this June, scored 111 points to 59
for Stanford and 32 for Hayward
State. But the Cards won both
relays and the 220 and 440.
James Lofton, NorCal trackster
of the week, had his second big
meet for the Cards. Lofton won
the long jump with a school re
cord leap of 26-2 Vi, took the 220
and ran a 45.9 anchor leg on the
mile relay to hold off San Jose
State's Dedy Cooper.
"James j s developing as a
world-class performer in three
events," Jordan said. "His open
ing jump last week is one of the
top marks in the nation. He cap
ped the day with a scintilling
mile relay leg against the vau
nted Dedy Cooper. We had him
in 45.9 though one of our
watches showed 45.4."
Shot putter Terry Albritton
missed the meet after suffering
strained ligaments in his hand
while competing in the national
ASU championships in New
York. He finished second in the
meet with a 67-8 put.
In addition to Lofton, sprinters
Gordy Banks and Alan Sheats
ran impressively.
