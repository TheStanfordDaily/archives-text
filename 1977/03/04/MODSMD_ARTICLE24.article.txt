The intramural basketball sea
son winds up this Sunday, with
four championship games be
ginning at 1 p.m. on the large
court at Maples Pavilion. All
games are free and the public is
encouraged to attend.
The first game, with the men's
'B' league at stake, matches the
Wasted Parrots (9-0) against
Eucalypto (9-0). In the semifi
nals, the top-ranked Parrots had
to overcome 35 points by oppos
ing guards Kirk Davis and Scott
Bruzek, and survive a furious
last-minute rally, in order to tip
Soto 46-45.
Third-ranked Eucalypto had
an easier time. Rik Walker had
21 points, including 13 of his
team's 19 second-half tallies,
and held Turk Schonert to 16
points as Eucalypto beat Too
Low 47-41.
'C' final
The 'C' leaguefinal, which fol
lows at 3 p.m., will feature Los
Casuals and Biz 11, which was a
48-39 winner over the Valcans in
Wednesday's semifinal.
Organized Grime meets Les
Vaches in the women's 'A'
league final, in what should be a

real grudge match. In an earlier
meeting of the teams, top-ranked
Les Vaches came out on top
35-33, but the Grime's better ba
lance could mean an upset in the
title game.
The women's 'B' finals will

Faisan, a 19-17 winner over
Zapata, will meet Cedro, which

advanced with a 1-0 victory over
top-rated Los Ghingones, on a
goal by Joe Hower. ZAP. with
