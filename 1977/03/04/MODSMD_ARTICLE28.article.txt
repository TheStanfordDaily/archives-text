# Corliss eyes NCAA swim meet
## 
### Paul Bauman 
The man who will lead the
Stanford men's swim team to
the NCAA Championships in
Cleveland later this month is
self-admittedly a klutz on
land, likes to pretend to have
nervous breakdowns, and
once thought his father, a
medical school professor,
was retarded.
Co-captain Stuart Corliss is
sometimes crazy, sometimes
serious, usually funny, and
always colorful. He's also
quite a swimmer. You just
wouldn't know it right away.
Quite frankly, Corliss gives
the impression of being a
bumbling fool. His walk is
kind of an awkward shuffle
(you'd swear he was recover
ing from corrective surgery),
and his clothes look like they
should be torn up and used
for dust rags. One of Corliss'
regular outfits is a pair of
Converse tennis shoes so old
they've begun to decompose,
a pair of olive green Marine
fatigues, and a green, white
and yellow plaid long-sleeve
flannel shirt.
Corliss' room in Toy on
Hall? What would you ex
pect? Right — a shambles.
Papers strewn all over the
floor. Books, papers, rocks,
seashells, pens, and assorted
trash piled six inches high on
his desk.
Breakdown pretense
Cod help the person who
comes to visit Corliss in his
room. Knock, knock.
"Come in," Corliss says
casually, knowing full well
the door is locked.
The lock clicks a few times
as the visitor tries to open the
door.
"Come in," Corliss repeats
louder.
The lock clicks a few more
times.
"COME IN," Corliss yells at
the top of his lungs. He then
pretends to start crying, his

head buried in his hands.
Corliss finally gets up to
answer the door and finds a
very confused guest.
Corliss is not really crazy,
but he loves to be thought of
that way. He even signs
(scribbles is a more approp
riate word) his name "Crazy,
Stu."
Don't be deceived by Cor
liss' appearance or antics.
He's really very talented
physically and mentally.
Corliss, a junior and Stan
ford's top breaststroker, has
come from "nowhere, really,"
according to head swim
coach Jim Gaughran. to rank
in the top echelon of Ameri
can breaststrokers.
Corliss has improved al
most weekly since he first ar
rived at Stanford. His
freshman year, he astounded
his teammates by scoring a
personal — best time every
meet. Swimmers usually re
cord lifetime bests only to
ward the end of a season.
Last year as a sophomore,
the Memphis, Tenn. resident
recorded a lifetime best in the
200-yard breaststroke, his
best event, in the NCAAs, but
was disqualified for an illegal
kick. He made All-American
anyway by finishing 11th in
the 100 breaststroke.
Corliss owns the nation's
eighth fastest time in the 200
breaststroke this season and

could finish in the tup three at
the NCAAs, March 24-26.
Against UCLA last month, he
beat Kip Virts, the 18th
ranked breaststroker in the
world.
Gaughran said "most guys
don't improve at the rate Stu
has here.
"If Stu gets beaten by*a guy
in one race, that doesn't mean
he'll get beaten in the next
race. If the other guy doesn't
keep improving, Stu's going
to beat him. That's all there is
to it."
Corliss reached a peak last
August when he swam the
best race of his life in the 1976
AAU Outdoor Champion
ships in Philadelphia. He
finished third behind two
1976 Olympians, former
Stanford teammate John
Hencken and Charlie Keat
ing, in the 200-meter
breaststroke.
Corliss' Philadelphia effort
qualified him for a September
swim trip to Egypt and
Greece. He said he made the
most of his first venture out
side North America.
"1 enjoyed every minute of
it," Corliss said, "except the
food was terrible. That didn't
bother me, though. As long as
we were in Egypt, I'd have
slept on the floor and eaten
rock salt."
The Egypt-Greece trip was
the greatest material reward

of Corliss' swimming career,
which started when he was
seven years old.
Corliss said he took up
swimming because "1 didn't
have any coordination for
anything else, and that's the
honest to God truth.
It was about this time when
young Stuart was having dif
ficulty understanding the
complex world around him.
Corliss said that, when his
father would say at breakfast
that he had to leave for
school, young Stuart won
dered to himself, "Why is he
still going to school? He must
be retarded."
No decision
Corliss said he had his
heart set on attending Stan
ford since he was 15. "Stan
ford was the best swim/study
combination you could get, 1
thought," he explained.
There can be no doubt that
Corliss is serious about his
classes at Stanford. He often
shuns social activities Friday
and Saturday nights during
the swim season to study.
During one finals week last
year, he found himsell with a
little extra time on his hands
and studied 40 hours for a
Cerman test.
"I tried to open the hook the
morning of the test," Corliss
said, "and 1 almost threw up."
Corliss' serious side is best
exemplified by his activities
last quarter. He swam two to
three hours a day, picked up
garbage in the Stadium over
100 hours to finance his por
tion of a swim team Christmas
trip to Hawaii, and took 18
units (no mic.ks). His grades
were two "A s," one " A-" and
one "B
Now you're getting to know
Stuart Corliss: silly at times,
all-business at others.
Corlis will undoubtedly
drop the clown act when he
steps up on the blocks in three
weeks in Cleveland.

Stu Corliss
The man who will lead the
Stanford men's swim team to
the NCAA Championships in
Cleveland later this month is
self-admittedly a klutz on
land, likes to pretend to have
nervous breakdowns, and
once thought his father, a
medical school professor,
was retarded.
Co-captain Stuart Corliss is
sometimes crazy, sometimes
serious, usually funny, and
always colorful. He's also
quite a swimmer. You just
wouldn't know it right away.
Quite frankly, Corliss gives
the impression of being a
bumbling fool. His walk is
kind of an awkward shuffle
(you'd swear he was recover
ing from corrective surgery),
and his clothes look like they
should be torn up and used
for dust rags. One of Corliss'
regular outfits is a pair of
Converse tennis shoes so old
they've begun to decompose,
a pair of olive green Marine
fatigues, and a green, white
and yellow plaid long-sleeve
flannel shirt.
Corliss' room in Toy on
Hall? What would you ex
pect? Right — a shambles.
Papers strewn all over the
floor. Books, papers, rocks,
seashells, pens, and assorted
trash piled six inches high on
his desk.
Breakdown pretense
Cod help the person who
comes to visit Corliss in his
room. Knock, knock.
"Come in," Corliss says
casually, knowing full well
the door is locked.
The lock clicks a few times
as the visitor tries to open the
door.
"Come in," Corliss repeats
louder.
The lock clicks a few more
times.
"COME IN," Corliss yells at
the top of his lungs. He then
pretends to start crying, his

head buried in his hands.
Corliss finally gets up to
answer the door and finds a
very confused guest.
Corliss is not really crazy,
but he loves to be thought of
that way. He even signs
(scribbles is a more approp
riate word) his name "Crazy,
Stu."
Don't be deceived by Cor
liss' appearance or antics.
He's really very talented
physically and mentally.
Corliss, a junior and Stan
ford's top breaststroker, has
come from "nowhere, really,"
according to head swim
coach Jim Gaughran. to rank
in the top echelon of Ameri
can breaststrokers.
Corliss has improved al
most weekly since he first ar
rived at Stanford. His
freshman year, he astounded
his teammates by scoring a
personal — best time every
meet. Swimmers usually re
cord lifetime bests only to
ward the end of a season.
Last year as a sophomore,
the Memphis, Tenn. resident
recorded a lifetime best in the
200-yard breaststroke, his
best event, in the NCAAs, but
was disqualified for an illegal
kick. He made All-American
anyway by finishing 11th in
the 100 breaststroke.
Corliss owns the nation's
eighth fastest time in the 200
breaststroke this season and

could finish in the tup three at
the NCAAs, March 24-26.
Against UCLA last month, he
beat Kip Virts, the 18th
ranked breaststroker in the
world.
Gaughran said "most guys
don't improve at the rate Stu
has here.
"If Stu gets beaten by*a guy
in one race, that doesn't mean
he'll get beaten in the next
race. If the other guy doesn't
keep improving, Stu's going
to beat him. That's all there is
to it."
Corliss reached a peak last
August when he swam the
best race of his life in the 1976
AAU Outdoor Champion
ships in Philadelphia. He
finished third behind two
1976 Olympians, former
Stanford teammate John
Hencken and Charlie Keat
ing, in the 200-meter
breaststroke.
Corliss' Philadelphia effort
qualified him for a September
swim trip to Egypt and
Greece. He said he made the
most of his first venture out
side North America.
"1 enjoyed every minute of
it," Corliss said, "except the
food was terrible. That didn't
bother me, though. As long as
we were in Egypt, I'd have
slept on the floor and eaten
rock salt."
The Egypt-Greece trip was
the greatest material reward

of Corliss' swimming career,
which started when he was
seven years old.
Corliss said he took up
swimming because "1 didn't
have any coordination for
anything else, and that's the
honest to God truth.
It was about this time when
young Stuart was having dif
ficulty understanding the
complex world around him.
Corliss said that, when his
father would say at breakfast
that he had to leave for
school, young Stuart won
dered to himself, "Why is he
still going to school? He must
be retarded."
No decision
Corliss said he had his
heart set on attending Stan
ford since he was 15. "Stan
ford was the best swim/study
combination you could get, 1
thought," he explained.
There can be no doubt that
Corliss is serious about his
classes at Stanford. He often
shuns social activities Friday
and Saturday nights during
the swim season to study.
During one finals week last
year, he found himsell with a
little extra time on his hands
and studied 40 hours for a
Cerman test.
"I tried to open the hook the
morning of the test," Corliss
said, "and 1 almost threw up."
Corliss' serious side is best
exemplified by his activities
last quarter. He swam two to
three hours a day, picked up
garbage in the Stadium over
100 hours to finance his por
tion of a swim team Christmas
trip to Hawaii, and took 18
units (no mic.ks). His grades
were two "A s," one " A-" and
one "B

Stu Corliss
The man who will lead the
Stanford men's swim team to
the NCAA Championships in
Cleveland later this month is
self-admittedly a klutz on
land, likes to pretend to have
nervous breakdowns, and
once thought his father, a
medical school professor,
was retarded.
Co-captain Stuart Corliss is
sometimes crazy, sometimes
serious, usually funny, and
always colorful. He's also
quite a swimmer. You just
wouldn't know it right away.
Quite frankly, Corliss gives
the impression of being a
bumbling fool. His walk is
kind of an awkward shuffle
(you'd swear he was recover
ing from corrective surgery),
and his clothes look like they
should be torn up and used
for dust rags. One of Corliss'
regular outfits is a pair of
Converse tennis shoes so old
they've begun to decompose,
a pair of olive green Marine
fatigues, and a green, white
and yellow plaid long-sleeve
flannel shirt.
Corliss' room in Toy on
Hall? What would you ex
pect? Right — a shambles.
Papers strewn all over the
floor. Books, papers, rocks,
seashells, pens, and assorted
trash piled six inches high on
his desk.
Breakdown pretense
Cod help the person who
comes to visit Corliss in his
room. Knock, knock.
"Come in," Corliss says
casually, knowing full well
the door is locked.
The lock clicks a few times
as the visitor tries to open the
door.
"Come in," Corliss repeats
louder.
The lock clicks a few more
times.
"COME IN," Corliss yells at
the top of his lungs. He then
pretends to start crying, his

head buried in his hands.
Corliss finally gets up to
answer the door and finds a
very confused guest.
Corliss is not really crazy,
but he loves to be thought of
that way. He even signs
(scribbles is a more approp
riate word) his name "Crazy,
Stu."
Don't be deceived by Cor
liss' appearance or antics.
He's really very talented
physically and mentally.
Corliss, a junior and Stan
ford's top breaststroker, has
come from "nowhere, really,"
according to head swim
coach Jim Gaughran. to rank
in the top echelon of Ameri
can breaststrokers.
Corliss has improved al
most weekly since he first ar
rived at Stanford. His
freshman year, he astounded
his teammates by scoring a
personal — best time every
meet. Swimmers usually re
cord lifetime bests only to
ward the end of a season.
Last year as a sophomore,
the Memphis, Tenn. resident
recorded a lifetime best in the
200-yard breaststroke, his
best event, in the NCAAs, but
was disqualified for an illegal
kick. He made All-American
anyway by finishing 11th in
the 100 breaststroke.
Corliss owns the nation's
eighth fastest time in the 200
breaststroke this season and

could finish in the tup three at
the NCAAs, March 24-26.
Against UCLA last month, he
beat Kip Virts, the 18th
ranked breaststroker in the
world.
Gaughran said "most guys
don't improve at the rate Stu
has here.
"If Stu gets beaten by*a guy
in one race, that doesn't mean
he'll get beaten in the next
race. If the other guy doesn't
keep improving, Stu's going
to beat him. That's all there is
to it."
Corliss reached a peak last
August when he swam the
best race of his life in the 1976
AAU Outdoor Champion
ships in Philadelphia. He
finished third behind two
1976 Olympians, former
Stanford teammate John
Hencken and Charlie Keat
ing, in the 200-meter
breaststroke.
Corliss' Philadelphia effort
qualified him for a September
swim trip to Egypt and
Greece. He said he made the
most of his first venture out
side North America.
"1 enjoyed every minute of
it," Corliss said, "except the
food was terrible. That didn't
bother me, though. As long as
we were in Egypt, I'd have
slept on the floor and eaten
rock salt."
The Egypt-Greece trip was
the greatest material reward

of Corliss' swimming career,
which started when he was
seven years old.
Corliss said he took up
swimming because "1 didn't
have any coordination for
anything else, and that's the
honest to God truth.
It was about this time when
young Stuart was having dif
ficulty understanding the
complex world around him.
Corliss said that, when his
father would say at breakfast
that he had to leave for
school, young Stuart won
dered to himself, "Why is he
still going to school? He must
be retarded."
No decision
Corliss said he had his
heart set on attending Stan
ford since he was 15. "Stan
ford was the best swim/study
combination you could get, 1
thought," he explained.
There can be no doubt that
Corliss is serious about his
classes at Stanford. He often
shuns social activities Friday
and Saturday nights during
the swim season to study.
During one finals week last
year, he found himsell with a
little extra time on his hands
and studied 40 hours for a
Cerman test.
"I tried to open the hook the
morning of the test," Corliss
said, "and 1 almost threw up."
Corliss' serious side is best
exemplified by his activities
last quarter. He swam two to
three hours a day, picked up
garbage in the Stadium over
100 hours to finance his por
tion of a swim team Christmas
trip to Hawaii, and took 18
