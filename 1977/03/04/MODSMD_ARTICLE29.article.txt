## Revise Dolly selections 
### Chris Kamel 
The Stanford Dollies. Well, they're nothing less
than an institution here at Stanford. 1 mean, you
just can't have "Stanford" without "Dollies". (You
can hear ol' Leland turning in his grave now.) It's
true, though. Very few people can pick a member
of the Council of Presidents or an ASSU senator
out of a crowd, but practically everyone has seen at
some time or another Stanford's five celebrities.
Each Dolly claims that all the work trying out
was worth itâ€”and they definitely worked for it.
Before tryouts, there were two workshops of two
hours apiece for three weeks, but between these
each would spend hours a day practicing their
routines.
1 was quite surprised, then, to see some of the
discrepancies in the selection of the Dollies last
Monday. True, the election may not seem that im
portant to some people, but all the contestants
deserve a fair election with all the hours they put
into it.
The area that seems to need the most work is the
guidelines (or more appropriately, the lack of] for
judging.
The ballot consisted of a maximum of 50
points divided over five different categories (a
maximum of 10 in each). It would seem quite dif
ficult to see, then, how a girl could get a zero score
in each category for a total of zero while another on
the same ballot would get a perfect score of 50
points. But there were various ballots with both
zeros and 50s.
According to Heidi Jacobsen, one of the Dollies
this year, many of the judges could have misinter
preted the scoring system and rated the girls on an
"all-or-nothing" scale while others used degrees
of the 50 point system. Of course, you could play
the Devil's advocate and go to the other extreme by
saying that many judges tried to promote some
girls by "blackballing" others.
Neither will ever be able to be proven, so the best
solution would be to establish one common system
that can be interpreted by all in the same way.
Those who don't follow it would then have their
ballots voided.
You might ask if 50 votes would matter from one
girl to the next when over 3000 votes are being cast

in all, but think about this for a moment. There
were about 100 copies of the ballot printed up and
according to Heidi, the Dollies invited about 70
judges in all including all band members present,
varsity athletes, and representatives from the ad
ministration and various student organizations.
Where did the extra 30 go? Well, some people got
to the Little Theatre very early and managed to
pick up one while others pretended to be with
student organizations they weren't actually af
filiated with.
Therefore, 50 votes might not make a difference,
but 1500 would. A system should be established to
keep track of the number of ballots and to whom
they are supposed to be issued. Not just anyone
should be able to pick up a ballot and fill it out. The
list of judges should also be more balanced. The
number of band members choosing the 10
finalists should be brought down to the level of
other organizations and therefore a larger variety
of student areas would be represented.
There should also be a slight change in the selec
tion of the five winners. As it is established now,
four band members interview the prospective Dol
lies. The results of these interviews along with the
impressions of the other band members and the
present Dollies are weighted and the committee
announces the winners.
I think the band members should be represented
in some way in the final decision because they will
have to work with the new Dollies all year. How
ever, the present Dollies should be the ones who
make the final selections because they would be
the best judges of which girls are the best dancers,-
and who will be able to put up with the band
members during the year.
Finally, an improvement for next year should be
made in the scheduling of a place for tryouts. By
starting time last Monday afternoon, the Little
Theatre of Memorial Auditorium was overflowing
with people, both judges and spectators. The
crowd must have been not more than five feet from
the contestants and once the group got excited by
certain routine, the place brought back fond
memories of Oregon's McArthur Court, known af-.
fectionately as "The Pit".
