# Administration to propose record budget
## 
### Mike Charison 
After nine years of operating budget
deficits, the University hopes to show
a $236,000 surplus during 1977-78.
The surplus was included in the re
cord $108.7 million proposed operat
ing budget for 1977-78 which was un
veiled before the Faculty Senate yes
terday.
The Board of Trustees will consider
the budget at its regular March meet
ing Monday and Tuesday at the board
offices in San Francisco. The Monday
session will be solely for budget dis
cussion.
The proposed budget is 12 per cent
higher than the $96.2 million allocated
for the current year. It will represent
about 1/3 of the proposed $355 million
consolidated budget of the University,
according to the proposals prepared by
the Office of the Vice Provost for
Budget and Planning.
The operating budget portion of the
consolidated budget includes all of the
regular unrestricted funds available to
the University plus those funds, such

as endowed professorships, which are
restricted to the core activities of
teaching and departmental support,
the proposal stated.
Student briefing
Major highlights of the proposed
budget and the proposals themselves
were reviewed at a student briefing
given earlier in the day by Raymond
Bacchetti, vice provost for budget and
planning, and Kent Peterson, director
of management and financial plan
ning.
The proposals are part of the final
year of the Budget Equilibrium Prog
ram (BEP), Bacchetti said, which,
combined with the earlier Budget Ad
justment Program (BAP), has "altered
the financial situation of the Univer
sity by about $16 million through
budget cuts and income increases"
over the past eight years.
Bacchetti said the $5.8 million
budget deficit accumulated since
1968-69 has been covered by the
Operating Budget Reserve Fund.
Beginning this year, budgets will

hopefully show a surplus, said Bac
chetti, which will be used to replenish
the reserve. Pre-deficit reserve levels
were about $7 million, according to
Controller Kenneth Creighton.
But budgets were much smaller in
the '60s, he pointed out.
He said he felt the University would
probablay continue to build the re
serve fund until it equaled five to 10
per cent of the budget. There is no "es
tablished wisdom" between budget to
tals and percentage of reserve kept, he
said, but "I would be surprised if the
University moved to a reserve of grea
ter than 10 per cent."
More money
Peterson said he felt it was impor
tant to note that although cuts from the
BEP totaled $555,000 this year, most
budgets actually received more money
than last year.
Salaries, the single largest budget
item, were determined largely by two
factors, he said. The University does a
"market survey" to see what compara
ble institutions pay their professors
and the University gives pay increases
on merit.
The market surveys are necessary,
Bacchetti said, to ensure that the qual
ity of the Stanford faculty is main
tained.
Bacchetti said the financial aids of
fice budget cuts which resulted in a
$200 increase in student self-help ex
pectations were needed to reduce the
"financial incentive" for poorer stu
dents to attend the University.
The increase "gets us where we
want to be" to make the amount of
money a student gets no longer a factor
in the choice of which school the stu
dent attends, Bacchetti said.
Next year's self-help expectation
will be $1750, compared with an Ivy
League average of $1900, he said.
Many organizations require more than
$2000 in self-help, he said.
Utility costs
In addition to salaries, utility costs
are a major concern, said Peterson. A
55 per cent energy cost increase last

year compounded by a 32 per cent
eneigy cost increase last year com
increase this
year has put a strain on the budget.
Another 34 per cent increase is fore
cast in the budget proposals for next
year.
The higher costs will bring pressure
to conserve water and energy, altera
tions in new building plans and
changes in the University lifestyle,
Peterson said.
Present conservation measures are
saving money, he said, noting that the
funds left over will cause a smaller in
crease in room and board costs for
1978-79. Creighton explained there is
generally a one year lag before savings
results are reflected in tuition figures.
Another highlight of the budget
proposals was a three per ceni expen
diture for "consolidations and im
provements." This category includes
all new programs.
Included in the figure is $475 mill
ion to maintain the staff in the General
Secretary's Office at Campaign for
Stanford size.
Minimize dropoffs
Maintaining the staff size should
help minimize the gifts dropoff that
usually occurs at the end of a cam
paign because the staff can continue
solicitation of contributions, said Bac
chetti.
Four factors — tuition, salary levels,
improvements in the University and
increasing energy costs — will most
affect future budget planning, Bac
chetti said.
The University had previously ex
pected to increase tuition by about 4.2
per cent above inflation. Next year's
tuition rate of $4695 will reflect a 3.8
per cent real growth.
In the future, however, said Bac
chetti, tuition will likely rise at the rate
of personal income, or about eight to
nine per cent if current trends con
tinue.
As for salaries, "Stanford can't pay
less than it takes to attract the kind of
faculty we want," he said.

dent attends, Bacchetti said.
Next year's self-help expectation
will be $1750, compared with an Ivy
League average of $1900, he said.
Many organizations require more than
$2000 in self-help, he said.
Utility costs
In addition to salaries, utility costs
are a major concern, said Peterson. A
55 per cent energy cost increase last

year compounded by a 32 per cent
eneigy cost increase last year com
increase this
year has put a strain on the budget.
Another 34 per cent increase is fore
cast in the budget proposals for next
year.
The higher costs will bring pressure
to conserve water and energy, altera
tions in new building plans and
changes in the University lifestyle,
Peterson said.
Present conservation measures are
saving money, he said, noting that the
funds left over will cause a smaller in
crease in room and board costs for
1978-79. Creighton explained there is
generally a one year lag before savings
results are reflected in tuition figures.
Another highlight of the budget
proposals was a three per ceni expen
diture for "consolidations and im
provements." This category includes
all new programs.
Included in the figure is $475 mill
ion to maintain the staff in the General
Secretary's Office at Campaign for
Stanford size.
Minimize dropoffs
Maintaining the staff size should
help minimize the gifts dropoff that
usually occurs at the end of a cam
paign because the staff can continue
solicitation of contributions, said Bac
chetti.
Four factors — tuition, salary levels,
improvements in the University and
increasing energy costs — will most
affect future budget planning, Bac
chetti said.
The University had previously ex
pected to increase tuition by about 4.2
per cent above inflation. Next year's
tuition rate of $4695 will reflect a 3.8
per cent real growth.
In the future, however, said Bac
chetti, tuition will likely rise at the rate
of personal income, or about eight to
nine per cent if current trends con
tinue.
As for salaries, "Stanford can't pay
less than it takes to attract the kind of
faculty we want," he said.
After nine years of operating budget
deficits, the University hopes to show
a $236,000 surplus during 1977-78.
The surplus was included in the re
cord $108.7 million proposed operat
ing budget for 1977-78 which was un
veiled before the Faculty Senate yes
terday.
The Board of Trustees will consider
the budget at its regular March meet
ing Monday and Tuesday at the board
offices in San Francisco. The Monday
session will be solely for budget dis
cussion.
The proposed budget is 12 per cent
higher than the $96.2 million allocated
for the current year. It will represent
about 1/3 of the proposed $355 million
consolidated budget of the University,
according to the proposals prepared by
the Office of the Vice Provost for
Budget and Planning.
The operating budget portion of the
consolidated budget includes all of the
regular unrestricted funds available to
the University plus those funds, such

as endowed professorships, which are
restricted to the core activities of
teaching and departmental support,
the proposal stated.
Student briefing
Major highlights of the proposed
budget and the proposals themselves
were reviewed at a student briefing
given earlier in the day by Raymond
Bacchetti, vice provost for budget and
planning, and Kent Peterson, director
of management and financial plan
ning.
The proposals are part of the final
year of the Budget Equilibrium Prog
ram (BEP), Bacchetti said, which,
combined with the earlier Budget Ad
justment Program (BAP), has "altered
the financial situation of the Univer
sity by about $16 million through
budget cuts and income increases"
over the past eight years.
Bacchetti said the $5.8 million
budget deficit accumulated since
1968-69 has been covered by the
Operating Budget Reserve Fund.
Beginning this year, budgets will

hopefully show a surplus, said Bac
chetti, which will be used to replenish
the reserve. Pre-deficit reserve levels
were about $7 million, according to
Controller Kenneth Creighton.
But budgets were much smaller in
the '60s, he pointed out.
He said he felt the University would
probablay continue to build the re
serve fund until it equaled five to 10
per cent of the budget. There is no "es
tablished wisdom" between budget to
tals and percentage of reserve kept, he
said, but "I would be surprised if the
University moved to a reserve of grea
ter than 10 per cent."
More money
Peterson said he felt it was impor
tant to note that although cuts from the
BEP totaled $555,000 this year, most
budgets actually received more money
than last year.
Salaries, the single largest budget
item, were determined largely by two
factors, he said. The University does a
"market survey" to see what compara
ble institutions pay their professors
and the University gives pay increases
on merit.
The market surveys are necessary,
Bacchetti said, to ensure that the qual
ity of the Stanford faculty is main
tained.
Bacchetti said the financial aids of
fice budget cuts which resulted in a
$200 increase in student self-help ex
pectations were needed to reduce the
"financial incentive" for poorer stu
dents to attend the University.
The increase "gets us where we
want to be" to make the amount of
money a student gets no longer a factor
in the choice of which school the stu
dent attends, Bacchetti said.
Next year's self-help expectation
will be $1750, compared with an Ivy

given earlier in the day by Raymond
Bacchetti, vice provost for budget and
planning, and Kent Peterson, director
of management and financial plan
ning.
The proposals are part of the final
year of the Budget Equilibrium Prog
ram (BEP), Bacchetti said, which,
combined with the earlier Budget Ad
justment Program (BAP), has "altered
the financial situation of the Univer
sity by about $16 million through
budget cuts and income increases"
over the past eight years.
Bacchetti said the $5.8 million
budget deficit accumulated since
1968-69 has been covered by the
Operating Budget Reserve Fund.
Beginning this year, budgets will

hopefully show a surplus, said Bac
chetti, which will be used to replenish
the reserve. Pre-deficit reserve levels
were about $7 million, according to
Controller Kenneth Creighton.
But budgets were much smaller in
the '60s, he pointed out.
He said he felt the University would
probablay continue to build the re
serve fund until it equaled five to 10
per cent of the budget. There is no "es
tablished wisdom" between budget to
tals and percentage of reserve kept, he
said, but "I would be surprised if the
University moved to a reserve of grea
ter than 10 per cent."
More money
Peterson said he felt it was impor
tant to note that although cuts from the
BEP totaled $555,000 this year, most
budgets actually received more money
than last year.
Salaries, the single largest budget
item, were determined largely by two
factors, he said. The University does a
"market survey" to see what compara
ble institutions pay their professors
and the University gives pay increases
on merit.
The market surveys are necessary,
Bacchetti said, to ensure that the qual
ity of the Stanford faculty is main
tained.
Bacchetti said the financial aids of
fice budget cuts which resulted in a
$200 increase in student self-help ex
pectations were needed to reduce the
"financial incentive" for poorer stu
dents to attend the University.
The increase "gets us where we
want to be" to make the amount of
money a student gets no longer a factor
in the choice of which school the stu
dent attends, Bacchetti said.
Next year's self-help expectation
will be $1750, compared with an Ivy
League average of $1900, he said.
Many organizations require more than
$2000 in self-help, he said.
Utility costs
In addition to salaries, utility costs
are a major concern, said Peterson. A
55 per cent energy cost increase last

year compounded by a 32 per cent
eneigy cost increase last year com
increase this
year has put a strain on the budget.
Another 34 per cent increase is fore
cast in the budget proposals for next
year.
The higher costs will bring pressure
to conserve water and energy, altera
tions in new building plans and
changes in the University lifestyle,
Peterson said.
Present conservation measures are
saving money, he said, noting that the
funds left over will cause a smaller in
crease in room and board costs for
1978-79. Creighton explained there is
generally a one year lag before savings
results are reflected in tuition figures.
Another highlight of the budget
proposals was a three per ceni expen
diture for "consolidations and im
provements." This category includes
all new programs.
Included in the figure is $475 mill
ion to maintain the staff in the General
Secretary's Office at Campaign for
Stanford size.
Minimize dropoffs
Maintaining the staff size should
help minimize the gifts dropoff that
usually occurs at the end of a cam
paign because the staff can continue
solicitation of contributions, said Bac
chetti.
Four factors — tuition, salary levels,
improvements in the University and
increasing energy costs — will most
affect future budget planning, Bac
chetti said.
The University had previously ex
pected to increase tuition by about 4.2
per cent above inflation. Next year's
tuition rate of $4695 will reflect a 3.8
per cent real growth.
In the future, however, said Bac
chetti, tuition will likely rise at the rate
of personal income, or about eight to
nine per cent if current trends con
tinue.
As for salaries, "Stanford can't pay
less than it takes to attract the kind of
faculty we want," he said.
After nine years of operating budget
deficits, the University hopes to show
a $236,000 surplus during 1977-78.
The surplus was included in the re
cord $108.7 million proposed operat
ing budget for 1977-78 which was un
veiled before the Faculty Senate yes
terday.
The Board of Trustees will consider
the budget at its regular March meet
ing Monday and Tuesday at the board
offices in San Francisco. The Monday
session will be solely for budget dis
cussion.
The proposed budget is 12 per cent
higher than the $96.2 million allocated
for the current year. It will represent
about 1/3 of the proposed $355 million
consolidated budget of the University,
according to the proposals prepared by
the Office of the Vice Provost for
Budget and Planning.
The operating budget portion of the
consolidated budget includes all of the
regular unrestricted funds available to
the University plus those funds, such

as endowed professorships, which are
restricted to the core activities of
teaching and departmental support,
the proposal stated.
