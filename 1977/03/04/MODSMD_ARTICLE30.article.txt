Economic program clears hurdle
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's program
for economic stimulation passed preliminary tests in
the Senate and House yesterday.
First the Senate, by voice vote, and then the House,
on a 226-173 roll call, agreed to amend the budget for
the current year to allow $17.5 billion worth of
emergency spending and tax cuts. Later action will
be required to approve the specific tax cuts and
spending programs.
Republicans in both houses made clear that their
vote for the budget amendment did not commit them
to support Carter's tax-cut plan, but showed only
that they see the need for some economic stimulus.
Many Republicans favor a permanent tax cut
rather than the one-shot $50-per-person rebate prop
osed by Carter.
The budget amendment accepted by both houses
will raise federal spending in the current fiscal year,
which ends on Sept. 30, to $417.5 billion. That will
mean a deficit of $69.8 billion.
The House delayed until next Tuesday considera
tion of Carter's modified $13.8-billion plan of tax
cuts, including rebates for 200 million Americans
and a small permanent tax reduction for 45 million
couples and individuals. Plans for increasing federal
spending by $3.7 billion over the next seven months
are covered in separate legislation.
IRS computer may invade privacy
Washington — A massive computer system prop
osed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could
offer "irresistible" opportunities for illegal govern
ment intrusions on Americans' privacy, a congres
sional study says.
The computer system, which the report says could
cost $1 billion, would make Americans' income tax
returns immediately available on thousands of ter
minals in IRS offices.
"TAS (Tax Administration System) will make
large quantities of personal information about
people available in the time it takes to snap two

fingers," the report said.
The IRS will ask for funds to start on the system tor
the next fiscal year, according to Patrick Ruttle, as
sistant IRS commissioner for tax administration.
Ruttle said in an interview that TAS will mean
better, faster service for taxpayers and "a more effi
cient tax system." He added that the new system
would be more secure than the current one.
"This is actually going to reduce the danger of
disclosure," he said. "This is a second generation
system. It will further tighten up controls on our own
employes and institute new system checks."
More than 48,000 IRS employes would have ac
cess to the computer through more than 9000 termi
nals scattered across the country.
The draft report, based on the findings of a panel of
experts convened by the Office of Technology As
sessment, said sufficient information has not been
provided about the system by the IRS to enable Con
gress to make a decision on the project.
Amin continues political killings
Nairobi, Kenya — Refugees from Uganda claimed
yesterday that President Idi Amin is continuing a
bloody purge of Christian tribes in his troubled East
African country.
Kenyan church sources in touch with American
missionaries in Uganda, however, said they have
received no reports of Americans being molested
and that missionaries there appear determined to
remain in the country and continue their work.
Other missionaries, they said, are waiting in
neighboring Kenya for a suitable time to go to
Uganda.
Reorganization bill goes to House
Washington — The Senate passed legislation yes
terday that is designed to give President Jimmy Car
ter the authority he requested to reorganize the gov
ernment's executive agencies.
The 92-0 Senate vote sends the measure to the
House.

Under the measure, when Carter submits reor
ganization plans to Congress, the plans take effect
automatically unless disapproved by either the Se
nate or the House within 60 days.
The bill would permit the president to submit
plans that abolish, transfer and consolidate agencies.
However, the president could not create or abolish
Cabinet-level departments or independent regulat
ory agencies.
One of Carter's major campaign commitments was
to overhaul the federal bureaucracy in an effort to
make it more efficient and responsive.
Housing may be unaffordable soon
New York — If present trends carry into the 1980s,
the average cost of a new home will be $78,000 "and
only the most affluent groups would be able to afford
them," says a report issued yesterday.
Only 27 per cent of American families can afford
the 1976 median new-home price of $44,200, accord
ing tothe report, "The Nation's Housing Needs, 1975
to 1985," done by the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for
Urban Studies.
The report said the trend that could produce an
average price of $78,000 for new homes in the 1980s
was apparent. In 1970, it said, nearly 47 per cent of
American families could afford the median new
home price of $23,400.
The main culprits for the rise in new housing
prices have been inflation, higher construction and
material costs, higher land costs and larger interest
charges for both the builder and home buyer.
Demand in the 1980s should increase, however,
for modest-sized housing for young families ex
pected to raise fewer children.
