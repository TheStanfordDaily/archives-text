# Lyman: Protest not in violation of campus disruption policy
## 
### Bonny Rodden 
Demonstrators who occupied an of
fice Monday in protest of the Universi
ty's position on a J.P. Stevens proxy
resolution did not violate the campus
disruption policy, President Richard
Lyman emphasized in an interview
yesterday.
On Campus Conference earlier this
week, he warned there would be prob
lems if people attempt to occupy
buildings when they are supposed to
be closed or interfere with the conduct
of University business.
Lyman refused during yesterday's
interview to specify what "interfering
with the conduct of University busi
ness" entails.
The Daily's Wednesday article in
correctly stated that Lyman was de
nouncing the protest as being a viola
tion of the campus disruption policy.
About 60 demonstrators occupied
the reception room of Vice President
for Business and Finance Robert Au
gsburger for nearly two hours Monday,
voting to leave when they were
threatened with arrest. Director of Pub
lic Safety Marvin Herrington agreed to
extend the closing hourof the building
from 6 p.m. until 6:10 p.m. The build
ing was cleared by 6:30 p.m.
Lyman said in yesterday's inter
view, "Oneis torn between wanting to
be clear that the disruption policy will
be maintained on the one hand and not
wanting to try to anticipate every con
ceivable pattern of behavior, not want
ing to put a chip on your shoulder
that's a standing temptation for some
one to knock off."
Abstention
The University voted its 3000 shares
of LP- Stevens stock in favor of a resol
ution calling for the company to dis
close affirmative action information. It
abstained from voting on the resolu
tion that the company disclose de
tailed information on employe wages
and labor relations.
Lyman said the University has voted
against management in the past.
Augsburger also wrote a letter to J.P.

Stevens, asking what the company had
done to correct acts found illegal by
the National Labor Relations Board.
The letter notified the company of the
large number of students and faculty
who signed petitions supporting both
resolutions.
Lyman said he supports the de
monstrators' right to free speech, but
commented that protesters tend to
oversimplify issues.
'Villains and heroes'
"I think that's one thing that goes on
in White Plaza. People can make the
world into villainsand heroes, with no
shades of gray or ambiguity, and it's a
comfortable feeling — while it lasts."
Lyman said students concerned
about an issue frequently tend to look
at it narrowly.
Asked whether he thought the Uni
versity has a moral obligation as a
progressive institution to support such
causes as the two resolutions, he said
the University has some social respon
sibility.
However, the University must also
consider its moral responsibility to
"use its endowment for the purpose set
forward in the founding grant,"
Lyman said.
"And it follows from that that the
University has a moral obligation to
maximize the benefit to itself of the
endowment because the endowment
exists to serve the University, which
exists to serve educational research,"
he said.
He said what happens to university
endowments greatly affects a universi
ty's ability to keep tuition low.
Conflicting actions
"So you might find the very same
students protesting one day that tui
tion is too high, and the next day take
steps, which in our view, would lessen
the value of the endowment, lessen the
income we derive from the endow
ment and put more pressure on the
tuition," he said.
Asked to comment on the plans of
several students to ask the University

to withdraw its investments in com
panies involved in South Africa,
Lyman said. "I think they might do
well to go back and look at how often
that was attempted before.
"This is an absolute repeat recycling
of history. As far as I can tell, the argu
ments would be the same from both
sides. If they think there's any point in
it, they're certainly free to go ahead
and try."
The University's primary function,
he said, is "to be what it is — it's not to
range around the world trying to offer
solutions to the world's problems."

forward in the founding grant,"
Lyman said.
"And it follows from that that the
University has a moral obligation to
maximize the benefit to itself of the
endowment because the endowment
exists to serve the University, which
exists to serve educational research,"
he said.
He said what happens to university
endowments greatly affects a universi
ty's ability to keep tuition low.
Conflicting actions
"So you might find the very same
students protesting one day that tui
tion is too high, and the next day take
steps, which in our view, would lessen
the value of the endowment, lessen the
income we derive from the endow
ment and put more pressure on the
tuition," he said.
Asked to comment on the plans of
several students to ask the University

to withdraw its investments in com
panies involved in South Africa,
Lyman said. "I think they might do
well to go back and look at how often
that was attempted before.
"This is an absolute repeat recycling
of history. As far as I can tell, the argu
ments would be the same from both
sides. If they think there's any point in
it, they're certainly free to go ahead
and try."
The University's primary function,
he said, is "to be what it is — it's not to
range around the world trying to offer
solutions to the world's problems."
Demonstrators who occupied an of
fice Monday in protest of the Universi
ty's position on a J.P. Stevens proxy
resolution did not violate the campus
disruption policy, President Richard
Lyman emphasized in an interview
yesterday.
On Campus Conference earlier this
week, he warned there would be prob
lems if people attempt to occupy
buildings when they are supposed to
be closed or interfere with the conduct
of University business.
Lyman refused during yesterday's
interview to specify what "interfering
with the conduct of University busi
ness" entails.
The Daily's Wednesday article in
correctly stated that Lyman was de
nouncing the protest as being a viola
tion of the campus disruption policy.
About 60 demonstrators occupied
the reception room of Vice President
for Business and Finance Robert Au
gsburger for nearly two hours Monday,
voting to leave when they were
threatened with arrest. Director of Pub
lic Safety Marvin Herrington agreed to
extend the closing hourof the building
from 6 p.m. until 6:10 p.m. The build
ing was cleared by 6:30 p.m.
Lyman said in yesterday's inter
view, "Oneis torn between wanting to
be clear that the disruption policy will
be maintained on the one hand and not
wanting to try to anticipate every con
ceivable pattern of behavior, not want
ing to put a chip on your shoulder
that's a standing temptation for some
one to knock off."
Abstention
The University voted its 3000 shares
of LP- Stevens stock in favor of a resol
ution calling for the company to dis
close affirmative action information. It
abstained from voting on the resolu
tion that the company disclose de
tailed information on employe wages
and labor relations.
Lyman said the University has voted
against management in the past.
Augsburger also wrote a letter to J.P.

Stevens, asking what the company had
done to correct acts found illegal by
the National Labor Relations Board.
The letter notified the company of the
large number of students and faculty
who signed petitions supporting both
resolutions.
Lyman said he supports the de
monstrators' right to free speech, but
commented that protesters tend to
oversimplify issues.
'Villains and heroes'
"I think that's one thing that goes on
in White Plaza. People can make the
world into villainsand heroes, with no
shades of gray or ambiguity, and it's a
comfortable feeling — while it lasts."
Lyman said students concerned
about an issue frequently tend to look
at it narrowly.
Asked whether he thought the Uni
versity has a moral obligation as a
progressive institution to support such
causes as the two resolutions, he said
the University has some social respon
sibility.
However, the University must also
consider its moral responsibility to
"use its endowment for the purpose set
forward in the founding grant,"
Lyman said.
"And it follows from that that the
University has a moral obligation to
maximize the benefit to itself of the
endowment because the endowment
exists to serve the University, which
exists to serve educational research,"
he said.
