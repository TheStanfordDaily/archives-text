# Human Bio Chairman to leave
## Kennedy new FDA head 
### Kathy Trafton 
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy,
chairman of the Program in Human
Biology, was named commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) yesterday by Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare Joseph
Calif ano. •
Kennedy's appointment will be
come effective this month.
"I hate to leave Stanford," Kennedy,
45, said. "But 1 feel privileged to go to
work for an important agency whose
area of responsibility interests me very
much.
"At the moment my interest vastly
exceeds my state of knowledge. Over
the next few weeks 1 wil 1 spend most of
my time educating myself on the many
complex issues with which the agency
deals," he said.
"Califano has made an inspired ap
pointment," said President Richard
Lyman. "Don's departure will be a ter
rible blow to us. We will miss him
sorely."
Kennedy's departure will adversely
affect the Human Biology Program, ac
cording to students and adminis
trators.
Program's loss
"He is Human Bio," said human
biology major Mary Ortiz. "The kids
are going to be missing a hell of a lot
next quarter and next year without
him. I can see the feeling going out of

the program when he leaves.'
"Any program that Don Kennedy
leaves will be drastically affected by
it," said Provost William Miller. "We
will just have to look for an alternate
leader. We will not let the human biol
ogy program languish."
Kennedy said the human biology
program has always been charac
terized by both broad faculty participa
tion and terrific student support.
There has been no time to search for
a new program head, but program
committees will be meeting within the
next 10 days to discuss the new
changes.
Kennedy said he plans to come back
to Stanford after he completes the
four-year term. He will be on a leave of
absence until that time.
Kennedy has been making arrange
ments for guest professors to handle
his Human Biology 4A and 4B classes
next quarter. However, his course
"U.S. Agriculture: Interaction of Biol
ogy," co-taught by Walter Falcon, will
be cancelled.
No agenda
Kennedy said he is not bringing an
agenda to the FDA. Although he is
knowledgeable in such areas as regula
tions and pesticides, he is not as well
versed in other areas, he said
In recent years the FDA has been
"caught between the social cost of in
troducing unsafe drugs and the costs

of unduly delaying safe ones," Ken
nedy said He does not yet have a view
on whether the FDA has been over
regulating orunderregulating, he said.
The present degree of regulation
may not even he constant from one
area to another within the FDA. Ken
nedy said. He pointed to i»s diverse
areas of responsibility, which include
medical devices, biology, veterinary
medicines and food.
Kennedy will be the chief adminis
trative officer for an organization with
7000 employes and an annual budget
of $275 million.
A specialist in neurophysiology,
Kennedy has been a faculty member
since 1960.
