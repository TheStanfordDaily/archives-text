# State bill on DNA research proposed
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” A plan for state
control of genetic research that is
creating new, and possibly dangerous,
organisms was proposed in the
California legislature yesterday.
It would be the nation's first legisla
tion aimed at preventing escape from
laboratories of new organisms that
might cause incurable disease.
The legislation was endorsed "in
principle" by Gov. Edmund Brown
jr.'s health director, Dr. Jerome Lack
ner.
"The governor will look closely at
the bill as it goes through the legisla
tive process," Lackner said at a news
conference.
'A salubrious effect'
Lackner said he hoped California's
efforts would have "a salubrious effect
on the thinking that's going on in
Washington right now," and lead to
federal controls.
The California legislation is aimed
primarily at "recombinant DNA" re
search which takes snippets of genetic
material from different organisms and
sticks them back together in new ar
rangements.
The first successful research was
done in 1970. Its rapid spread led con
cerned scientists to a brief self
imposed moratorium in 1975.
Research was resumed after the Na
tional Institutes of Health (NIH)
adopted voluntary guidelines, which
apply only to laboratories working
with federal money.
Spell it out
The NIH guidelines, among other
things, spell out how laboratories must
be built and operated to prevent "leak
age" of organisms to the outside.
They also require use of built-in
genetic mechanisms to make difficult
the survival of an organism should it
escape the laboratory.
The proposed legislation would
create a 17-member independent state
commission with power toadopt regu
lations at least as strict as the NIH
guidelines.
Nobody could conduct "recombin
ant DNA" research or other biological
research determined by the commis
sion to be hazardous without a com
mission certificate, which would be is
sued only after the applicant spelled
out what he planned to do, how he
would do it, and what safety precau
tions he would take.
Empowered
The commission would be empo
wered to inspect labs, to seek court
orders stopping research that poses
"significant hazard," or to shut down
