# Legislature responds to hospital plight
## 
### Jim Tranquada (Last of a series) 
After more than a year of conversations between
concerned state, county and medical school offi
cials, legislation purporting to offer a solution to the
impending county fiscal crisis is being readied in
Sacramento.
State Senate Majority Floor Leader David Roberti
(D-Hollywood) will be introducing the California
Health Services Act, which he said is "the first step
towards a rational, accessible, economical and com
prehensive system of health care for the poor in
California."
The legislation comes at a critical juncture for
county health care systems. Since 1971, 10 county
hospitals have been closed in California. The ac
creditation of Santa Clara Valley Medical Center
(VMC) where Stanford residents are trained, is in
jeopardy because of a chronic lack of funds for
maintenance and upkeep.
San Mateo County's Chope Community Hospital
faces the same accreditation problems due to lack of
funds, and came close to being closed this month.
Los Angeles county hospitals, which have already
had $7 million cut from their budget this year, face
further severe cuts in funding.
Governor's support
The governor's support is "vital" to the act, but
Gov. Edmund Bcown Jr. has not yet indicated his
support for the bill, according to Michael Woo, ad

ministrative assistant to Roberti.
A major feature of the bill, according to Woo, is
that it will provide approximately $150 million in
"emergency fiscal relief" for county hospitals over a
three-year period.
According to the latest draft of the bill, $37 million
will be available the first year and $42.65 million the
second year. The state and the counties are currently
negotiating the third year's funding.
To be eligible for these funds, counties must
guarantee that they will not cut back on the present
level of medical care they provide, and that their
services are accessible to everyone.
Although three methods of allocating the money
to the counties are under consideration, Los Angeles
county will probably receive the largest single share,
according to Woo.
Largest deficit
Los Angeles county has the largest deficit in the
state, due to several factors. Among these factors are
the scope and complexity of the health care system
there, the fact that 40 per cent of California's Medi-
Cal population lives in Los Angeles county and the
county's "long history of providing generous levels
of health care to the poor." according to Ed Edelman,
chairman of the Los Angeles county board of super
visors.
But "the real problem is not in Los Angeles,"
Roberti said. "The real problem is in Sacramento,
where the state government has closed its eves while

county health programs for the poor throughout
California have verged on collapse."
In order toreverse this trend, another major feature
of the act would create a state-county health services
task force, Woo said. The three-year emergency fis
cal relief would provide an "interim" period during
which the task force would develop recommenda
tions. the most significant of which would deal with
shifting financial responsibility for the medical in
digent to the state and clarifying the relationship
between counties and the State Department of
Health, he said.
Reimbursement
Counties would be reimbursed on the basis of a
broad composite rate rather than the individual fee
billing system which has been responsible for much
of the additional expense to the counties.
Despite the apparent urgency of the problems con
fronting county medicine, Dr. JeromeLackner, direc
tor of the State Department of Health, "has not been
particularly supportive," according to Dr. F'aul
O'Rourke of the Senate Research Office.
The health department and the Association of
County Hospital Administrators have been holding
discussions for more than a year in an effort to re
solve the problem, O'Rourke said. He said lackner
wanted to break off the conversations late last year
when it became apparent that they had become
stalemated.

Largest deficit
Los Angeles county has the largest deficit in the
state, due to several factors. Among these factors are
the scope and complexity of the health care system
there, the fact that 40 per cent of California's Medi-
Cal population lives in Los Angeles county and the
county's "long history of providing generous levels
of health care to the poor." according to Ed Edelman,
chairman of the Los Angeles county board of super
visors.
But "the real problem is not in Los Angeles,"
Roberti said. "The real problem is in Sacramento,
where the state government has closed its eves while

county health programs for the poor throughout
California have verged on collapse."
In order toreverse this trend, another major feature
of the act would create a state-county health services
task force, Woo said. The three-year emergency fis
cal relief would provide an "interim" period during
which the task force would develop recommenda
tions. the most significant of which would deal with
shifting financial responsibility for the medical in
digent to the state and clarifying the relationship
between counties and the State Department of
Health, he said.
Reimbursement
Counties would be reimbursed on the basis of a
broad composite rate rather than the individual fee
billing system which has been responsible for much
of the additional expense to the counties.
Despite the apparent urgency of the problems con
fronting county medicine, Dr. JeromeLackner, direc
tor of the State Department of Health, "has not been
particularly supportive," according to Dr. F'aul
O'Rourke of the Senate Research Office.
The health department and the Association of
County Hospital Administrators have been holding
discussions for more than a year in an effort to re
solve the problem, O'Rourke said. He said lackner
wanted to break off the conversations late last year
when it became apparent that they had become
stalemated.
After more than a year of conversations between
concerned state, county and medical school offi
cials, legislation purporting to offer a solution to the
impending county fiscal crisis is being readied in
Sacramento.
State Senate Majority Floor Leader David Roberti
(D-Hollywood) will be introducing the California
Health Services Act, which he said is "the first step
towards a rational, accessible, economical and com
prehensive system of health care for the poor in
California."
The legislation comes at a critical juncture for
county health care systems. Since 1971, 10 county
hospitals have been closed in California. The ac
creditation of Santa Clara Valley Medical Center
(VMC) where Stanford residents are trained, is in
jeopardy because of a chronic lack of funds for
maintenance and upkeep.
San Mateo County's Chope Community Hospital
faces the same accreditation problems due to lack of
funds, and came close to being closed this month.
Los Angeles county hospitals, which have already
had $7 million cut from their budget this year, face
further severe cuts in funding.
Governor's support
The governor's support is "vital" to the act, but
Gov. Edmund Bcown Jr. has not yet indicated his
support for the bill, according to Michael Woo, ad

ministrative assistant to Roberti.
A major feature of the bill, according to Woo, is
that it will provide approximately $150 million in
"emergency fiscal relief" for county hospitals over a
three-year period.
According to the latest draft of the bill, $37 million
will be available the first year and $42.65 million the
second year. The state and the counties are currently
negotiating the third year's funding.
To be eligible for these funds, counties must
guarantee that they will not cut back on the present
level of medical care they provide, and that their
services are accessible to everyone.
Although three methods of allocating the money
to the counties are under consideration, Los Angeles
county will probably receive the largest single share,
according to Woo.
