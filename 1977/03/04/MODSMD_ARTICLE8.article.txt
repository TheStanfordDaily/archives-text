## Opinions Support for dissidents vital

Alex Albert

In evaluating the general record of
Henry Kissinger's foreign policy in the
last two administrations, I find that
while I recognize the unquestioned
need for detente with the Soviet Un
ion, I cannot avoid thecommensurate
need to criticize that totalitarian state.
Are the drives towards peace and
freedom mutually exclusive? In hope
of answering that question negatively I
examined some recently publicized
cases in which dissidents confronted
Soviet and Eastern European dictator-
I ships in an attempt to determine how
. American protests against violations
of human rights could possibly
( jeopardize world peace.
! Take the Ford Administration's
; snub of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. What
. would have happened if he had been
* received at the White House? At worst,
• Leonid Brezhnev and company would
* have been insulted. And the most seri
| ous ramification of such an insult
. might have been a stall in the Helsinki
* • pact negotiations that were being held
"at that time.
But, given the climate of Helsinki,
the participants in the talks theoreti
cally should have applauded figures
such as Solzhenitsyn. And if that cli
mate were simply to be treated as a
mask, then it is impossible to justify
the Ford Administration's fear of per
turbing a foe who inherently violates
the commitment to human rights av
owed in such a treaty.
Vladimir Bukovsky, who was re
cently released from Soviet prison in
exchange for a Chilean communist
leader, has reported that prison regi
men under which he suffered became
much worse in 1975 after the Helsinki
! Declaration on East-West cooperation
was signed. Bukovsky, a survivor of
11 years in labor camps and men
tal asylums, was declared sane by Rus
sian psychiatrists only after wide
spread protests. In a twisted way it is
sadly appropriate that protest could
serve as a standard for a man's sanity.
This is true in the sense that free
• people in the West should be consi
dered insensitive if they can't take the
• time to criticize the Kremlin in the
form of petitions, telegrams, and at

tendance at rallies. Sensitivity has
been a neglected component of sanity
in the United States.
Does such protest only exacerbate
conditions behind the iron curtain?
This speculation, received a measure
of credence when Jewish emigration
from the Soviet Union decreased after
the Jackson amendment (which tacked
humanitarian criteria onto granting
the USSR most favored nation trading
status) was passed on Congress. How
ever, conditions in Eastern Europe
since the ratification of the Helsinki
pact indicate the fallacy of that line of
reasoning. Human rights are trampled
ir. totalitarian societies whether we
protest or not.
Detente must be intrinsically valu
able for the Russians; otherwise it is
merely a guise. To maintain as Kis
singer implies that detente must be
pursued to the extent that our princi
ples can be slighted is to maintain that
those principles are not conducive to
world peace. If detente shatters under
scrutiny of human values then its base
is meaningless.
What then is the course to secure
both peace and freedom? Certainly not
arms escalation. Having the power for
mutual annihilation, further military
developmentis wasteful and futile. Al
though our conventional forces are
currently inferior to those of the
Soviets, our deterrence is not necessar
ily diminished in local conflicts as
long as we take a resolute diplomatic
and — in the case of our democratic
allies — military posture. I do not
think we are being duped by the pre
sent Russian military expansion. The
arms race depletes their inflexible
economy more than ours. They are
simply taking advantage of our waf
fled stance, upon which our paranoia
concerning communism has led us
time and again to support dictatorial
regimes.
Perhaps if we stopped wavering in
respect to human rights detente would
be put to a true test. And I'm confident
that the Soviet Union and the United
States will eventually realize that the
need for peace stands apart from the
realm of ideology. At that point —

where coexistence becomes divorced
from political criticism — we will be
safe to protest basic human mistreat
ment by any standard.
This is not to suggest that cultural,
economic and scientific cooperation
with the East should not be a goal of
U.S. foreign policy. 1 do maintain,
however, that political protest should
not be sacrificed towards those ends.
In the practical sphere, this translates
into vigorous campaigning on behalf
of dissidents.
To this end, I cannot think of a more
stirring example than that of Mikhail
Shtern who was sentenced on Dec. 31,
1974 to eight years of hard labor on
trumped up charges by a Ukraniun
court. The eminent endocrinologist is
the victim of anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union in its most ancient and
cruel forms. Shtern's sons recently
published a transcript of their father's
trial which they smuggled to Europe.
The trial symbolized the need for us to
dispute injustice even where it has
been entrenched in lands, which force
of habit has caused us to look on with
resignation. Every violation of human
rights must be fought not "when op
portunity allows" but especially
where it has become acceptable.

Vladimir Bukovsky, who was re
cently released from Soviet prison in
exchange for a Chilean communist
leader, has reported that prison regi
men under which he suffered became
much worse in 1975 after the Helsinki
! Declaration on East-West cooperation
was signed. Bukovsky, a survivor of
11 years in labor camps and men
tal asylums, was declared sane by Rus
sian psychiatrists only after wide
spread protests. In a twisted way it is
sadly appropriate that protest could
serve as a standard for a man's sanity.
This is true in the sense that free

This speculation, received a measure
of credence when Jewish emigration
from the Soviet Union decreased after
the Jackson amendment (which tacked
humanitarian criteria onto granting
the USSR most favored nation trading

since the ratification of the Helsinki
pact indicate the fallacy of that line of

Detente must be intrinsically valu
able for the Russians; otherwise it is
merely a guise. To maintain as Kis
singer implies that detente must be
pursued to the extent that our princi

those principles are not conducive to
world peace. If detente shatters under
scrutiny of human values then its base
is meaningless.
What then is the course to secure
both peace and freedom? Certainly not
arms escalation. Having the power for
mutual annihilation, further military
developmentis wasteful and futile. Al
though our conventional forces are
currently inferior to those of the
Soviets, our deterrence is not necessar
ily diminished in local conflicts as
long as we take a resolute diplomatic
and — in the case of our democratic
allies — military posture. I do not
think we are being duped by the pre
sent Russian military expansion. The
arms race depletes their inflexible
economy more than ours. They are
simply taking advantage of our waf
fled stance, upon which our paranoia
concerning communism has led us
time and again to support dictatorial
regimes.
Perhaps if we stopped wavering in
respect to human rights detente would
be put to a true test. And I'm confident
that the Soviet Union and the United
States will eventually realize that the
need for peace stands apart from the
realm of ideology. At that point —

where coexistence becomes divorced
from political criticism — we will be
safe to protest basic human mistreat
ment by any standard.
This is not to suggest that cultural,
economic and scientific cooperation
with the East should not be a goal of
U.S. foreign policy. 1 do maintain,
however, that political protest should
not be sacrificed towards those ends.
In the practical sphere, this translates
into vigorous campaigning on behalf
of dissidents.
To this end, I cannot think of a more
stirring example than that of Mikhail
Shtern who was sentenced on Dec. 31,
1974 to eight years of hard labor on
trumped up charges by a Ukraniun
court. The eminent endocrinologist is
the victim of anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union in its most ancient and
cruel forms. Shtern's sons recently
published a transcript of their father's
trial which they smuggled to Europe.
The trial symbolized the need for us to
dispute injustice even where it has
been entrenched in lands, which force
of habit has caused us to look on with
resignation. Every violation of human
rights must be fought not "when op
portunity allows" but especially
where it has become acceptable.

dered insensitive if they can't take the
• time to criticize the Kremlin in the
form of petitions, telegrams, and at

tendance at rallies. Sensitivity has
been a neglected component of sanity
in the United States.
Does such protest only exacerbate
conditions behind the iron curtain?
This speculation, received a measure
of credence when Jewish emigration
from the Soviet Union decreased after
the Jackson amendment (which tacked
humanitarian criteria onto granting
the USSR most favored nation trading
status) was passed on Congress. How
ever, conditions in Eastern Europe
since the ratification of the Helsinki
pact indicate the fallacy of that line of
reasoning. Human rights are trampled
ir. totalitarian societies whether we
protest or not.
Detente must be intrinsically valu
able for the Russians; otherwise it is
merely a guise. To maintain as Kis
singer implies that detente must be
pursued to the extent that our princi
ples can be slighted is to maintain that
those principles are not conducive to
world peace. If detente shatters under
scrutiny of human values then its base
is meaningless.
What then is the course to secure
both peace and freedom? Certainly not
arms escalation. Having the power for
mutual annihilation, further military
developmentis wasteful and futile. Al
though our conventional forces are
currently inferior to those of the
Soviets, our deterrence is not necessar
ily diminished in local conflicts as
long as we take a resolute diplomatic
and — in the case of our democratic
allies — military posture. I do not
think we are being duped by the pre
sent Russian military expansion. The
arms race depletes their inflexible
economy more than ours. They are
simply taking advantage of our waf
fled stance, upon which our paranoia
concerning communism has led us
time and again to support dictatorial
regimes.
Perhaps if we stopped wavering in
respect to human rights detente would
be put to a true test. And I'm confident
that the Soviet Union and the United
States will eventually realize that the
need for peace stands apart from the
realm of ideology. At that point —

where coexistence becomes divorced
from political criticism — we will be
safe to protest basic human mistreat
ment by any standard.
This is not to suggest that cultural,
economic and scientific cooperation
with the East should not be a goal of
U.S. foreign policy. 1 do maintain,
however, that political protest should
not be sacrificed towards those ends.
In the practical sphere, this translates
into vigorous campaigning on behalf
of dissidents.
To this end, I cannot think of a more
stirring example than that of Mikhail
Shtern who was sentenced on Dec. 31,
1974 to eight years of hard labor on
trumped up charges by a Ukraniun
court. The eminent endocrinologist is
the victim of anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union in its most ancient and
cruel forms. Shtern's sons recently
published a transcript of their father's
trial which they smuggled to Europe.
The trial symbolized the need for us to
dispute injustice even where it has
been entrenched in lands, which force
of habit has caused us to look on with
resignation. Every violation of human
rights must be fought not "when op
portunity allows" but especially
where it has become acceptable.
