Steve Hansch's column on recom
binant DNA research (Daily Feb. 23)
manifests a notoriously shortsighted
and biased understanding of recom
binant DNA research. The column's at
titude is typical of the vocal minority
of people who seek to stop recombin
ant DNA research purely out of irra
tional fear and ignorance.
Hansch is obviously unaware of the
two public meetings sponsored by the
t'anel on Recombinant DNA Research
that were specifically designed to
bring the issue to the public. He is ob
viously unaware of the pending ac
tions of the panel to continue the pub
lic debate. He is still living in the dark
ages when he refers to the "... un
questioning attitude of most estab
lished scientists who glorify the pur
suit of knowledge at any price
Scientists are more aware of their ethi
cal and social responsibilities today
♦ ban at any time in the past. The at
titude is mirrored by the wide interest

.i science, public policy and the pub
lic understanding.
The act of formulating the DNA
guidelines was unprecedented in the
history of science. The statement
about "CIA-implanted pathogens" is
so obviously paranoid that 1 question
its seriousness.
This column's attitude is typical of
inflammatory radicals who wish to
bung back the violent upheaval of the
l<)H()s. While student activism in pub
lic affairs is absolutely essential today,
.ictivism to the point of impassioned
emotional, appeals and even violence
is reactionary. If the Alliance for Radi
cal Change (ARC) would crawl out of
its intellectual cave and encourage ac
tivism in tune with the progressive,
cooperative spirit of the 70s, perhaps
misunderstandings such as these
won't be so commonplace.
