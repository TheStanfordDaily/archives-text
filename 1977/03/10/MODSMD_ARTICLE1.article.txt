# Bio warfare research done here

The University and Stanford Re
search Institute (SKI) conducted
biological warfare research during the
1950s and early 19605, according to a
report from the Department of the
Army.
The report, released Tuesday, did
not contain any information on the
funding of the research, the personnel
conducting the research, the academic
departments that might have been in
volved or the express purpose of the
research.
However, the Daily has learned that
between 1951 and 1959 Emeritus
Chemistry Prof. Philip I.eighton con
ducted classified research for the
Chemical Corps of the Department of
the Army on air flow arid dispersion
patterns.
I.eighton said the research was
"funded by what was then called the
Chfemical Corps" and the Corps was
"interested in it from a viewpoint of
chemical warfare. That's the reason
they were willing to fund it,"he said.
I.eighton, who directed the Stanford
Aerosol Laboratory during the '50s,
said "our job was to develop a tracer to
study air flow" and to study the effects
of topography on air flow patterns. He
said the research, which was "done in
the back of the old chemistry build
ing." did not involve the use of biolog
ical agents.
I.eighton said his interest "was
merely the gathering of knowledge"
and that he was more concerned with
the effects of air flow patterns on smog
than with the military uses of his re
search.
According to Robert Beyers, director
of News and Publications. I.eighton,
on the basis of his findings, "became
an outspoken opponent of automotive
air pollution."
I.eighton also said there was "no
reason I could see to keep it (the re
search) classified" and said the re
search had "no relation to SRI."
The Army report listed the Univer
sity and SRI along with 8H other uni
versities and 120 business firms that
had contracts in biological warfare re-
search since President Roosevelt
started the program in 1042
The report said the University had
four contracts: from October 1951 to
April 1954. June 1954 to June 1955.
July 1955 to August 1950 and August
1950 to September 1959. In addition.
SKI had three contracts during the
early years of I J.S. involvement in Vie
tnam when SKI was a part of the Uni
versity. They were held from June
1954 to June 1955. August 1957 to Au
gust 1950 and March 1904 to January
1900.

William Massy, vice provost in
charge of research, has said his office
has "conducted a fairly extensive ef
fort to determine what the references
to Stanford may have been, other than
the contract dates." He added that
"this has proven virtually impossible
since most of our records of this era
were destroyed in the 1972 Enema
Hall fire."
Massy also said that he had not
checked with SRI about the contracts
anil that he didn't "see that it's some
thing of an emergency situation." I It
did say that his office would "do some
additional checking."

versities and 120 business firms that
had contracts in biological warfare re-
search since President Roosevelt
started the program in 1042
The report said the University had
four contracts: from October 1951 to
April 1954. June 1954 to June 1955.
July 1955 to August 1950 and August
1950 to September 1959. In addition.
SKI had three contracts during the
early years of I J.S. involvement in Vie
tnam when SKI was a part of the Uni
versity. They were held from June
1954 to June 1955. August 1957 to Au
gust 1950 and March 1904 to January
1900.

William Massy, vice provost in
charge of research, has said his office
has "conducted a fairly extensive ef
fort to determine what the references
to Stanford may have been, other than
the contract dates." He added that
"this has proven virtually impossible
since most of our records of this era
were destroyed in the 1972 Enema
Hall fire."
Massy also said that he had not
checked with SRI about the contracts
anil that he didn't "see that it's some
thing of an emergency situation." I It
did say that his office would "do some
additional checking."
The University and Stanford Re
search Institute (SKI) conducted
biological warfare research during the
1950s and early 19605, according to a
report from the Department of the
Army.
The report, released Tuesday, did
not contain any information on the
funding of the research, the personnel
conducting the research, the academic
departments that might have been in
volved or the express purpose of the
research.
However, the Daily has learned that
between 1951 and 1959 Emeritus
Chemistry Prof. Philip I.eighton con
ducted classified research for the
Chemical Corps of the Department of
the Army on air flow arid dispersion
patterns.
I.eighton said the research was
"funded by what was then called the
Chfemical Corps" and the Corps was
"interested in it from a viewpoint of
chemical warfare. That's the reason
they were willing to fund it,"he said.
I.eighton, who directed the Stanford
Aerosol Laboratory during the '50s,
said "our job was to develop a tracer to
study air flow" and to study the effects
of topography on air flow patterns. He
said the research, which was "done in
the back of the old chemistry build
ing." did not involve the use of biolog
ical agents.
I.eighton said his interest "was
merely the gathering of knowledge"
and that he was more concerned with
the effects of air flow patterns on smog
than with the military uses of his re
search.
According to Robert Beyers, director
of News and Publications. I.eighton,
on the basis of his findings, "became
an outspoken opponent of automotive
air pollution."
I.eighton also said there was "no
reason I could see to keep it (the re
search) classified" and said the re
search had "no relation to SRI."
