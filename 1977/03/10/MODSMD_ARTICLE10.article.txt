After three years at Stanford, it has
finally gotten through my thick skull:
Stanford is a university for students,
not a university of students. President
Richard Lyman has finally spelled it
out clearly for me in his warning to
students "not to interfere with the
conduct of the University" (Daily.
March 2).
Why couldn't I see it before? Ours is
a consumer society, a clientele society
in which people shop only for finished
products. We shop for everything —
including an education, a ready-made,
foolproof process for the manufacture
of lawyers, doctors, businessmen, etc.
Stanford is just such a process, an edu
cation which you buy as a finished
product.
The reason Stanford is so expensive
is that the process you're buying has
such an excellent reputation for suc
cess. The brand-name alone stamped
on your head is sometimes enough to
get you accepted in the right circles.
The problem is that while most
people are well-socialized — well
trained to accept finished products —
through somequirk of nature, thereare
always some people who escape com
plete socialization. These people still
refuse to shop for finished products
such as education.
instead of being passive objects of
the Stanford process once they have

paid their tuition, they want to he sub
jects. They want to take an active part
in what they see should be the constant
re-creation and improvement of the
University. They have the cra/v idea
that the University should he an ex
pression of students, faculty, and staff
working together as equals to further
knowledge and understanding.
These maladjusted individuals are
often viewed by the well-socialized as
the chronic-crabbers of the lunatic
fringe. Thus can they be dismissed as a
"silly" squeak in the Stanford process,
and the "rational thinking" can have
hope that someday the oil of socializa
tion will be able to reach into all the
cracks and crannies of society and end
that infernal noise.
Just think: If all institutions and
bureaucracies someday perfect their
processes, we will have a society in
which everyone is a nice, passive
shopper looking only for accepted
finished products. All we have to do is
kill creativity, individualism and ac
tivism!
As one of the "lunatic fringe." I feel it
only fair to warn all such dreamers: it
won't work. There will always be in
dividuals who refuse to be objects,
who will insist upon taking active part
in determining those processes which
affect their lives and those of their
children. And someday they will not
be regarded as "silly."

Jeff Dal Clerro should be commended
for his suggestion that the ASSU Se
nate "cut the comedy" (Daily Mar. 1).
There can be no doubt that a Senate
which plays jokes with student gov
ernment is indeed "sending them a
message."
It is impossible for the administra
tion to take t he Senate's ideas seriously
when manv of the members of the Se-

nate do not. It should lie remembered,
however, that some members of the
Senate do take student government
seriously. These senators should have
been given the praise they deserve,
even if their particular views do hap
pen to be objectionable.
In addition, although students are
transients, we should certainly get
more than a to be heard" for our
$25,000 investment. Hal Cerrountairh
attacks the competence of students
when he suggests that we are unable to
make major decisions.
The ASSU Senate and the COP
should have more than just an "influ
ence" in the university decision
making process. They should have an
equal weight with both the faculty and
the administration in deciding major
university issues. Dal Cerro should
keep in mind that the t Jniversity exists
for "transients" liks us. We are the
main customers of the education it
provides.

In response to Diane Long's letter
(Daily. Feb. 24). the Intramural De
partment is aware of the problem of
mismatched teams and welcomes
suggestions for its solution. Until a few
years ago. it was the department's pol
icy to group teams according to gen
eral classifications: fraternities,
dorms, graduates, etc.
Recently, we adopted "Instant
Scheduling" in each of the league
sports, which gives each team to
choose its level of ability, dates and
time preferences, etc. This has eased
the problem somewhat hut there still
remains mismatching.
Sometimes a "star" player cannot
play on the date his team chose to play,
for various reasons and his absence re
sults in a one-sided loss. We have no
control, nor do we desire it. over who
plays when. In our opinion, intramur
als should be strictly voluntary.
Perhaps, one solution would be to
eliminate IM point standings. A sam
ple survey of 207 managers, at the end
of fall quarter, indicates that only eight
teams said that the elimination of IM
points would keep them from par
ticipating; 95 managers answered that
they'd keep on playing. A more com
prehensive study is currently under
way, and these results may mean the
elimination of IM points.
The IM Department has been
amazed and concerned at the cornpara
tivelv few "A" teams, as compared to
the number of "B" teams that voluntar
ily sign-up. As Diane suggests, we may
be forced to switch the better "B"
teams to "A" classification and the less
talented "As" to "B" status.

Berlin
I'd like to thank Elizabeth Pollock
for her article (Daily, Feb. 22) on the
Berlin campus closure. There is one
error, however, that merits correction.
The article contained the implication
that the Berlin program was closed,
this year, to meet the Overseas Studies
budget projection for 197H-79.
In fact, the program was officially

terminated last year; it remained open
this year only through "one-time"
funds from the Provost's office. With
renegotiation of the Villa Muthesius
rental contract and with the continu
ing University budget concerns, these
funds are no longer available past June
1977.
Each closure, even a rumored clo
sure. of an overseas campus creates
considerable uproar in the student
comrrVunity. The recent activities of
the "Save Cliveden Committee" pro
vide a good example. Such sentiments
are represented in the Academic
Council's Committee on Foreign
Study Programs (C-FSP) by two voting
student members, myself and one
other. However, such sentiment has
rather less input. I feel, into the Pro
vost's budget decisions.
Berlin is an area of critical impor
tance in international affairs, particu
larly in this era of disenchantment
with detente. The city of Berlin un
doubtedly values the political signifi
cance of Stanford's presence there
nearly as much as we value our expo
sure in Berlin to the interfacing of im
mense political forces.
In view of this, from a purely per
sonal viewpoint I urge the Provost and
the University as a whole to reconsider
the cost-effectiveness of an $80,000
program in such an historically impor
tant city. Berlin cannot be funded
within the current Overseas Studies
budget; "one-time" funds were once
found in general funds. Surely such
funds can be located again, some
where in the $300 million University
hudget.

Education's role
"But if you wont a different job where
you don't hove to write perfect your
just waisting time in a english or His
tory class when you could be taking o
class that trains you to do what you
want to do." -{Written by a ninth grade
school newspaper staffer)
The above quote reflects a growing
trend to demand relevance of our
schools. The position is that schools
should give students those skills
necessary for adequate performance in
a social niche.
Tied in with this form of vocational
education is the three R's movement
which demands basic skills for filling
out job applications, income tax forms,
freshman English exams, etc. The
claim is that no longer should we learn
science for science's sake, history for
history's sake or art for art's sake.
Rather, we should learn these subjects
for our sake.
Such subjects should be made relev
ant to the student, they should give
him or her the knowledge and skills
needed for the career they choose.
Mastery of the three R's and job appli
cation skills become of top priority in a
school system whose goals revolve
around preparing students for jobs or
places in a social system.
There is. however, a central aspect of
this type of rationale which is being
left unexamined. Notice that nothing
is said about ways students come to
choose these careers which the schools
are to prepare them for. Who deter
mines such choices? Are tbev deter
mined by a school counselor, by

socio-economic status, by IQ scores?
If so. it is certainly a misnomer to
call such activity "choice." On the
other hand, if we subscribe to the posi
tion that choise is involved, is it not the
responsibility of the schools to first
provide students with the knowledge
and skills needed to make personal
choices?
Is a ninth grader in a position to de
termine what type of career he wants?
Has he acquired the knowledge and
skills which will enable him to make
such a decision? And furthermore,
how effective can such a choice be in a
society which will not allow him or
her to fulfill it?
In short. I am not arguing here for a
particular position on this matter. My
point is that the three R's movement
and the advocates of vocational educa
tion have neglected the issue of how
student career goals are to be deter
mined. Recognizing and answering
this question is crucial if we are to get a
clear view of what schools as training
grounds really entails.

Psychological warfare
On the current issue of the J.P. Ste
vens & Co., I am not puzzled at the
University's ambiguity toward the fac
tors I can identify: (1) management
em ploye-stockholder communication
on issues of compensation and work
ing conditions. (2) open disclosure of
same, (3) the legal right of employes to
"organize" for collective bargaining or
less formal means for candid interplay
of the employe and institution.
For more than two decades, as a stu
dent or University staff member — I
have been instructed quite directly as
to the unacceptability of attempts in
this direction by the University staff. I
have seen any number of competent,
engaged, and energetic staff members
laid-off or placed on a depressed salary
schedule — shortly after having at
tempted to implement courteous and
reasoned processes directed toward
finding out how employes might im
prove their own positions, achieve
equal treatment, protect their peers or
friends, etc.
The University has two standard
mechanisms for dealing with such
aberrant behavior among the staff —
nonresponse to inquiries or solicita
tions and psychological warfare.
These are instructive devices which
invariably preceed the direct coun
teractions described above.
The consequence of this environ
ment has been perplexity and frustra
tion among the staff, and a level of
psychic intimidation which stifles
risk-taking of any sort, slowing crea
tive accomplishment significantly in
my view.
A staff in this setting of intimidation
is necessarily forced to ask 112 rst what
actions are certain to satisfy the
bureaucratic command to keep one's
mouth shut, and only then to consider
one's job function.
I am frankly surprised to find the J.P.
Stevens Co. (whoever they might be) to
be the issue. My experience at Stanford
has been that employes "organize" en
tirely out of desperation, entirely due
to the repressive tactics to which they

are habitually subjected.
The organizers are the adminis
trators with their misguided inclina
tion to equate information-seeking
with immaturity and other personality
defects which deserve prejudicijl
treatment.
It is quite unrealistically idealistic to
think that either Stanford or J.P. Ste
vens are unusual. It is a fact, no less,
that I would be dismissed without exp
lanation for writing this letter any
where else. That is normal in
America. I have come to think that the
repression of free thought is a be
haviorist imoerative among our
species.
If you reversed the job function ot
administrators and workers, you
would have all the same problems;
only the name plates would change,
and the agonizing would persist
among all. Still it is nice to see some
consideration of the issue somewhere
in the world.

The Office of Residential Education
approved the proposal for Androgyny
House announcing that it will occupy
the residence of Jordan House. To the
present residents of Jordan, we are
sorry to be dispossessing you or any
one, and hope that new arrangements
can be satisfactorily made.
To those who still feel we're totally
off-base with the whole idea, come by
sometime next year and we can talk
about just what has and hasn't hap
pened.
To those who've been supportive of
the project and helpful throughout the
last two months, those who signed pet
itions and wrote letters, and the Daily
which provided such an excellent
forum for discussion, the project is to
tally indebted. This was a difficult un
dertaking from the start, organized
only by an impromptu group.
We feel the approval represents the
success of a grassroot University-wide
movement, crossing disciplines and
perspectives, with only a common ex
citement and even curiosity perhaps in
seeing what a residence group or
ganized to explore sex roles and sex
role-related issues will discover of
learning and ways of learning, and
eventually about itself as a commun

In response to Diane Long's letter
(Daily. Feb. 24). the Intramural De
partment is aware of the problem of
mismatched teams and welcomes
suggestions for its solution. Until a few
years ago. it was the department's pol
icy to group teams according to gen
eral classifications: fraternities,
dorms, graduates, etc.
Recently, we adopted "Instant
Scheduling" in each of the league
sports, which gives each team to
choose its level of ability, dates and
time preferences, etc. This has eased
the problem somewhat hut there still
remains mismatching.
Sometimes a "star" player cannot
play on the date his team chose to play,
for various reasons and his absence re
sults in a one-sided loss. We have no
control, nor do we desire it. over who
plays when. In our opinion, intramur
als should be strictly voluntary.
Perhaps, one solution would be to
eliminate IM point standings. A sam
ple survey of 207 managers, at the end
of fall quarter, indicates that only eight
teams said that the elimination of IM
points would keep them from par
ticipating; 95 managers answered that
they'd keep on playing. A more com
prehensive study is currently under
way, and these results may mean the
elimination of IM points.
The IM Department has been
amazed and concerned at the cornpara
tivelv few "A" teams, as compared to
the number of "B" teams that voluntar
ily sign-up. As Diane suggests, we may
be forced to switch the better "B"
teams to "A" classification and the less
talented "As" to "B" status.

I'd like to thank Elizabeth Pollock
for her article (Daily, Feb. 22) on the
Berlin campus closure. There is one
error, however, that merits correction.
The article contained the implication
that the Berlin program was closed,
this year, to meet the Overseas Studies
budget projection for 197H-79.
In fact, the program was officially

terminated last year; it remained open
this year only through "one-time"
funds from the Provost's office. With
renegotiation of the Villa Muthesius
rental contract and with the continu
ing University budget concerns, these
funds are no longer available past June
1977.
Each closure, even a rumored clo
sure. of an overseas campus creates
considerable uproar in the student
comrrVunity. The recent activities of
the "Save Cliveden Committee" pro
vide a good example. Such sentiments
are represented in the Academic
Council's Committee on Foreign
Study Programs (C-FSP) by two voting
student members, myself and one
other. However, such sentiment has
rather less input. I feel, into the Pro
vost's budget decisions.
Berlin is an area of critical impor
tance in international affairs, particu
larly in this era of disenchantment
with detente. The city of Berlin un
doubtedly values the political signifi
cance of Stanford's presence there
nearly as much as we value our expo
sure in Berlin to the interfacing of im
mense political forces.
In view of this, from a purely per
sonal viewpoint I urge the Provost and
the University as a whole to reconsider
the cost-effectiveness of an $80,000
program in such an historically impor
tant city. Berlin cannot be funded
within the current Overseas Studies
budget; "one-time" funds were once
found in general funds. Surely such
funds can be located again, some
where in the $300 million University
hudget.

Education's role
"But if you wont a different job where
you don't hove to write perfect your
just waisting time in a english or His
tory class when you could be taking o
class that trains you to do what you
want to do." -{Written by a ninth grade
school newspaper staffer)
The above quote reflects a growing
trend to demand relevance of our
schools. The position is that schools
should give students those skills
necessary for adequate performance in
a social niche.
Tied in with this form of vocational
education is the three R's movement
which demands basic skills for filling
out job applications, income tax forms,
freshman English exams, etc. The
claim is that no longer should we learn
science for science's sake, history for
history's sake or art for art's sake.
Rather, we should learn these subjects
for our sake.
Such subjects should be made relev
ant to the student, they should give
him or her the knowledge and skills
needed for the career they choose.
Mastery of the three R's and job appli
cation skills become of top priority in a
school system whose goals revolve
around preparing students for jobs or
places in a social system.
There is. however, a central aspect of
this type of rationale which is being
left unexamined. Notice that nothing
is said about ways students come to
choose these careers which the schools
are to prepare them for. Who deter
mines such choices? Are tbev deter
mined by a school counselor, by

socio-economic status, by IQ scores?
If so. it is certainly a misnomer to
call such activity "choice." On the
other hand, if we subscribe to the posi
tion that choise is involved, is it not the
responsibility of the schools to first
provide students with the knowledge
and skills needed to make personal
choices?
Is a ninth grader in a position to de
termine what type of career he wants?
Has he acquired the knowledge and
skills which will enable him to make
such a decision? And furthermore,
how effective can such a choice be in a
society which will not allow him or
her to fulfill it?
In short. I am not arguing here for a
particular position on this matter. My
point is that the three R's movement
and the advocates of vocational educa
tion have neglected the issue of how
student career goals are to be deter
mined. Recognizing and answering
this question is crucial if we are to get a
clear view of what schools as training
grounds really entails.

Psychological warfare
On the current issue of the J.P. Ste
vens & Co., I am not puzzled at the
University's ambiguity toward the fac
tors I can identify: (1) management
em ploye-stockholder communication
on issues of compensation and work
ing conditions. (2) open disclosure of
same, (3) the legal right of employes to
"organize" for collective bargaining or
less formal means for candid interplay
of the employe and institution.
For more than two decades, as a stu
dent or University staff member — I
have been instructed quite directly as
to the unacceptability of attempts in
this direction by the University staff. I
have seen any number of competent,
engaged, and energetic staff members
laid-off or placed on a depressed salary
schedule — shortly after having at
tempted to implement courteous and
reasoned processes directed toward
finding out how employes might im
prove their own positions, achieve
equal treatment, protect their peers or
friends, etc.
The University has two standard
mechanisms for dealing with such
aberrant behavior among the staff —
nonresponse to inquiries or solicita
tions and psychological warfare.
These are instructive devices which
invariably preceed the direct coun
teractions described above.
The consequence of this environ
ment has been perplexity and frustra
tion among the staff, and a level of
psychic intimidation which stifles
risk-taking of any sort, slowing crea
tive accomplishment significantly in
my view.
A staff in this setting of intimidation
is necessarily forced to ask 112 rst what
actions are certain to satisfy the
bureaucratic command to keep one's
mouth shut, and only then to consider
one's job function.
I am frankly surprised to find the J.P.
Stevens Co. (whoever they might be) to
be the issue. My experience at Stanford
has been that employes "organize" en
tirely out of desperation, entirely due
to the repressive tactics to which they

are habitually subjected.
The organizers are the adminis
trators with their misguided inclina
tion to equate information-seeking
with immaturity and other personality
defects which deserve prejudicijl
treatment.
It is quite unrealistically idealistic to
think that either Stanford or J.P. Ste
vens are unusual. It is a fact, no less,
that I would be dismissed without exp
lanation for writing this letter any
where else. That is normal in
America. I have come to think that the
repression of free thought is a be
haviorist imoerative among our
species.
If you reversed the job function ot
administrators and workers, you
would have all the same problems;
only the name plates would change,
and the agonizing would persist
among all. Still it is nice to see some
consideration of the issue somewhere
in the world.

House announcing that it will occupy
the residence of Jordan House. To the

can be satisfactorily made.
To those who still feel we're totally

To those who've been supportive of
the project and helpful throughout the

tally indebted. This was a difficult un

only by an impromptu group.
We feel the approval represents the
success of a grassroot University-wide

After three years at Stanford, it has
finally gotten through my thick skull:
Stanford is a university for students,
not a university of students. President
Richard Lyman has finally spelled it
out clearly for me in his warning to
students "not to interfere with the
conduct of the University" (Daily.
March 2).
Why couldn't I see it before? Ours is
a consumer society, a clientele society
in which people shop only for finished
products. We shop for everything —
including an education, a ready-made,
foolproof process for the manufacture
of lawyers, doctors, businessmen, etc.
Stanford is just such a process, an edu
cation which you buy as a finished
product.
The reason Stanford is so expensive
is that the process you're buying has
such an excellent reputation for suc
cess. The brand-name alone stamped
on your head is sometimes enough to
get you accepted in the right circles.
The problem is that while most
people are well-socialized — well
trained to accept finished products —
through somequirk of nature, thereare
always some people who escape com
plete socialization. These people still
refuse to shop for finished products
such as education.
instead of being passive objects of
the Stanford process once they have

paid their tuition, they want to he sub
jects. They want to take an active part
in what they see should be the constant
re-creation and improvement of the
University. They have the cra/v idea
that the University should he an ex
pression of students, faculty, and staff
working together as equals to further
knowledge and understanding.
These maladjusted individuals are
often viewed by the well-socialized as
the chronic-crabbers of the lunatic
fringe. Thus can they be dismissed as a
"silly" squeak in the Stanford process,
and the "rational thinking" can have
hope that someday the oil of socializa
tion will be able to reach into all the
cracks and crannies of society and end
that infernal noise.
Just think: If all institutions and
bureaucracies someday perfect their
processes, we will have a society in
which everyone is a nice, passive
shopper looking only for accepted
finished products. All we have to do is
kill creativity, individualism and ac
tivism!
As one of the "lunatic fringe." I feel it
only fair to warn all such dreamers: it
won't work. There will always be in
dividuals who refuse to be objects,
who will insist upon taking active part
in determining those processes which
affect their lives and those of their
children. And someday they will not
be regarded as "silly."

In view of this, from a purely per

the cost-effectiveness of an $80,000

Education's role
"But if you wont a different job where
you don't hove to write perfect your
just waisting time in a english or His
tory class when you could be taking o
class that trains you to do what you
want to do." -{Written by a ninth grade
school newspaper staffer)
The above quote reflects a growing
trend to demand relevance of our
schools. The position is that schools
should give students those skills
necessary for adequate performance in
a social niche.
Tied in with this form of vocational
education is the three R's movement
which demands basic skills for filling
out job applications, income tax forms,
freshman English exams, etc. The
claim is that no longer should we learn
science for science's sake, history for
history's sake or art for art's sake.
Rather, we should learn these subjects
for our sake.
Such subjects should be made relev
ant to the student, they should give
him or her the knowledge and skills
needed for the career they choose.
Mastery of the three R's and job appli
cation skills become of top priority in a
school system whose goals revolve
around preparing students for jobs or
places in a social system.
There is. however, a central aspect of
this type of rationale which is being
left unexamined. Notice that nothing
is said about ways students come to
choose these careers which the schools
are to prepare them for. Who deter
mines such choices? Are tbev deter
mined by a school counselor, by

socio-economic status, by IQ scores?
If so. it is certainly a misnomer to
call such activity "choice." On the
other hand, if we subscribe to the posi
tion that choise is involved, is it not the
responsibility of the schools to first
provide students with the knowledge
and skills needed to make personal
choices?
Is a ninth grader in a position to de
termine what type of career he wants?
Has he acquired the knowledge and
skills which will enable him to make
such a decision? And furthermore,
how effective can such a choice be in a
society which will not allow him or
her to fulfill it?
In short. I am not arguing here for a
particular position on this matter. My
point is that the three R's movement
and the advocates of vocational educa
tion have neglected the issue of how
student career goals are to be deter
mined. Recognizing and answering
this question is crucial if we are to get a
clear view of what schools as training
grounds really entails.

Psychological warfare
On the current issue of the J.P. Ste
vens & Co., I am not puzzled at the
University's ambiguity toward the fac
tors I can identify: (1) management
em ploye-stockholder communication
on issues of compensation and work
ing conditions. (2) open disclosure of
same, (3) the legal right of employes to
"organize" for collective bargaining or
less formal means for candid interplay
of the employe and institution.
For more than two decades, as a stu
dent or University staff member — I
have been instructed quite directly as
to the unacceptability of attempts in
this direction by the University staff. I
have seen any number of competent,
engaged, and energetic staff members
laid-off or placed on a depressed salary
schedule — shortly after having at
tempted to implement courteous and
reasoned processes directed toward
finding out how employes might im
prove their own positions, achieve
equal treatment, protect their peers or
friends, etc.
The University has two standard
mechanisms for dealing with such
aberrant behavior among the staff —
nonresponse to inquiries or solicita
tions and psychological warfare.
These are instructive devices which
invariably preceed the direct coun
teractions described above.
The consequence of this environ
ment has been perplexity and frustra
tion among the staff, and a level of
psychic intimidation which stifles
risk-taking of any sort, slowing crea
tive accomplishment significantly in
my view.
A staff in this setting of intimidation
is necessarily forced to ask 112 rst what
actions are certain to satisfy the
bureaucratic command to keep one's
mouth shut, and only then to consider
one's job function.
I am frankly surprised to find the J.P.
Stevens Co. (whoever they might be) to
be the issue. My experience at Stanford
has been that employes "organize" en
tirely out of desperation, entirely due
to the repressive tactics to which they

are habitually subjected.
The organizers are the adminis
trators with their misguided inclina
tion to equate information-seeking
with immaturity and other personality
defects which deserve prejudicijl
treatment.
It is quite unrealistically idealistic to
think that either Stanford or J.P. Ste
vens are unusual. It is a fact, no less,
that I would be dismissed without exp
lanation for writing this letter any
where else. That is normal in
America. I have come to think that the
repression of free thought is a be
haviorist imoerative among our
species.
If you reversed the job function ot
administrators and workers, you
would have all the same problems;
only the name plates would change,
and the agonizing would persist
among all. Still it is nice to see some
consideration of the issue somewhere
in the world.

After three years at Stanford, it has
finally gotten through my thick skull:
Stanford is a university for students,
not a university of students. President
Richard Lyman has finally spelled it
out clearly for me in his warning to
students "not to interfere with the
conduct of the University" (Daily.
March 2).
Why couldn't I see it before? Ours is
a consumer society, a clientele society
in which people shop only for finished
products. We shop for everything —
including an education, a ready-made,
foolproof process for the manufacture
of lawyers, doctors, businessmen, etc.
Stanford is just such a process, an edu
cation which you buy as a finished
product.
The reason Stanford is so expensive
is that the process you're buying has
such an excellent reputation for suc
cess. The brand-name alone stamped
on your head is sometimes enough to
get you accepted in the right circles.
The problem is that while most
people are well-socialized — well
trained to accept finished products —
through somequirk of nature, thereare
always some people who escape com
plete socialization. These people still
refuse to shop for finished products
such as education.
instead of being passive objects of
the Stanford process once they have

paid their tuition, they want to he sub
jects. They want to take an active part
in what they see should be the constant
re-creation and improvement of the
University. They have the cra/v idea
that the University should he an ex
pression of students, faculty, and staff
working together as equals to further
knowledge and understanding.
These maladjusted individuals are
often viewed by the well-socialized as
the chronic-crabbers of the lunatic
fringe. Thus can they be dismissed as a
"silly" squeak in the Stanford process,
and the "rational thinking" can have
hope that someday the oil of socializa
tion will be able to reach into all the
cracks and crannies of society and end
that infernal noise.
Just think: If all institutions and
bureaucracies someday perfect their
processes, we will have a society in
which everyone is a nice, passive
shopper looking only for accepted
finished products. All we have to do is
kill creativity, individualism and ac
tivism!
As one of the "lunatic fringe." I feel it
only fair to warn all such dreamers: it
won't work. There will always be in
dividuals who refuse to be objects,
who will insist upon taking active part
in determining those processes which
affect their lives and those of their
children. And someday they will not
be regarded as "silly."

In response to Diane Long's letter
(Daily. Feb. 24). the Intramural De
partment is aware of the problem of
mismatched teams and welcomes
suggestions for its solution. Until a few
years ago. it was the department's pol
icy to group teams according to gen
eral classifications: fraternities,
dorms, graduates, etc.
Recently, we adopted "Instant
Scheduling" in each of the league
sports, which gives each team to
choose its level of ability, dates and
time preferences, etc. This has eased
the problem somewhat hut there still
remains mismatching.
Sometimes a "star" player cannot
play on the date his team chose to play,
for various reasons and his absence re
sults in a one-sided loss. We have no
control, nor do we desire it. over who
plays when. In our opinion, intramur
als should be strictly voluntary.
Perhaps, one solution would be to
eliminate IM point standings. A sam
ple survey of 207 managers, at the end
of fall quarter, indicates that only eight
teams said that the elimination of IM
points would keep them from par
ticipating; 95 managers answered that
they'd keep on playing. A more com
prehensive study is currently under
way, and these results may mean the
elimination of IM points.
The IM Department has been
amazed and concerned at the cornpara
tivelv few "A" teams, as compared to
the number of "B" teams that voluntar
ily sign-up. As Diane suggests, we may
be forced to switch the better "B"
teams to "A" classification and the less
talented "As" to "B" status.

I'd like to thank Elizabeth Pollock
for her article (Daily, Feb. 22) on the
Berlin campus closure. There is one
error, however, that merits correction.
The article contained the implication
that the Berlin program was closed,
this year, to meet the Overseas Studies
budget projection for 197H-79.
In fact, the program was officially

terminated last year; it remained open
this year only through "one-time"
funds from the Provost's office. With
renegotiation of the Villa Muthesius
rental contract and with the continu
ing University budget concerns, these
funds are no longer available past June
1977.
Each closure, even a rumored clo
sure. of an overseas campus creates
considerable uproar in the student
comrrVunity. The recent activities of
the "Save Cliveden Committee" pro
vide a good example. Such sentiments
are represented in the Academic
Council's Committee on Foreign
Study Programs (C-FSP) by two voting
student members, myself and one
other. However, such sentiment has
rather less input. I feel, into the Pro
vost's budget decisions.
Berlin is an area of critical impor
tance in international affairs, particu
larly in this era of disenchantment
with detente. The city of Berlin un
doubtedly values the political signifi
cance of Stanford's presence there
nearly as much as we value our expo

In view of this, from a purely per

For more than two decades, as a stu
dent or University staff member — I
have been instructed quite directly as
to the unacceptability of attempts in
this direction by the University staff. I
have seen any number of competent,
engaged, and energetic staff members
laid-off or placed on a depressed salary
schedule — shortly after having at
tempted to implement courteous and
reasoned processes directed toward
finding out how employes might im
prove their own positions, achieve
equal treatment, protect their peers or
friends, etc.
The University has two standard
mechanisms for dealing with such
aberrant behavior among the staff —
nonresponse to inquiries or solicita
tions and psychological warfare.
These are instructive devices which
invariably preceed the direct coun
teractions described above.
The consequence of this environ
ment has been perplexity and frustra
tion among the staff, and a level of
psychic intimidation which stifles
risk-taking of any sort, slowing crea
tive accomplishment significantly in
my view.
A staff in this setting of intimidation
is necessarily forced to ask 112 rst what
actions are certain to satisfy the
bureaucratic command to keep one's
mouth shut, and only then to consider
one's job function.
I am frankly surprised to find the J.P.
Stevens Co. (whoever they might be) to
be the issue. My experience at Stanford
has been that employes "organize" en
tirely out of desperation, entirely due
to the repressive tactics to which they

are habitually subjected.
The organizers are the adminis
trators with their misguided inclina
tion to equate information-seeking
with immaturity and other personality
defects which deserve prejudicijl
treatment.
It is quite unrealistically idealistic to
think that either Stanford or J.P. Ste
vens are unusual. It is a fact, no less,
that I would be dismissed without exp
lanation for writing this letter any
where else. That is normal in
America. I have come to think that the
repression of free thought is a be
haviorist imoerative among our
species.
If you reversed the job function ot
administrators and workers, you
would have all the same problems;
only the name plates would change,
and the agonizing would persist
among all. Still it is nice to see some
consideration of the issue somewhere
in the world.

After three years at Stanford, it has
finally gotten through my thick skull:
Stanford is a university for students,
not a university of students. President
Richard Lyman has finally spelled it
out clearly for me in his warning to
students "not to interfere with the
conduct of the University" (Daily.
March 2).
Why couldn't I see it before? Ours is
a consumer society, a clientele society
in which people shop only for finished
products. We shop for everything —
including an education, a ready-made,
foolproof process for the manufacture
of lawyers, doctors, businessmen, etc.
Stanford is just such a process, an edu
cation which you buy as a finished
product.
The reason Stanford is so expensive
is that the process you're buying has
such an excellent reputation for suc
cess. The brand-name alone stamped
on your head is sometimes enough to
get you accepted in the right circles.
The problem is that while most
people are well-socialized — well
trained to accept finished products —
through somequirk of nature, thereare
always some people who escape com
plete socialization. These people still
refuse to shop for finished products
such as education.
instead of being passive objects of
the Stanford process once they have

paid their tuition, they want to he sub
jects. They want to take an active part
in what they see should be the constant
re-creation and improvement of the
University. They have the cra/v idea
that the University should he an ex
pression of students, faculty, and staff
working together as equals to further
knowledge and understanding.
These maladjusted individuals are
often viewed by the well-socialized as
the chronic-crabbers of the lunatic
fringe. Thus can they be dismissed as a
"silly" squeak in the Stanford process,
and the "rational thinking" can have
hope that someday the oil of socializa
tion will be able to reach into all the
cracks and crannies of society and end
that infernal noise.
Just think: If all institutions and
bureaucracies someday perfect their
processes, we will have a society in
which everyone is a nice, passive
shopper looking only for accepted
finished products. All we have to do is
kill creativity, individualism and ac
tivism!
As one of the "lunatic fringe." I feel it
only fair to warn all such dreamers: it
won't work. There will always be in
dividuals who refuse to be objects,
who will insist upon taking active part
in determining those processes which
affect their lives and those of their
children. And someday they will not
be regarded as "silly."

Jeff Dal Clerro should be commended
for his suggestion that the ASSU Se

There can be no doubt that a Senate

It is impossible for the administra

when manv of the members of the Se-

however, that some members of the
Senate do take student government
seriously. These senators should have
been given the praise they deserve,
even if their particular views do hap
pen to be objectionable.
In addition, although students are

when he suggests that we are unable to
make major decisions.
The ASSU Senate and the COP

making process. They should have an

In response to Diane Long's letter
(Daily. Feb. 24). the Intramural De
partment is aware of the problem of
mismatched teams and welcomes
suggestions for its solution. Until a few
years ago. it was the department's pol
icy to group teams according to gen
eral classifications: fraternities,
dorms, graduates, etc.
Recently, we adopted "Instant
Scheduling" in each of the league
sports, which gives each team to
choose its level of ability, dates and
time preferences, etc. This has eased
the problem somewhat hut there still
remains mismatching.
Sometimes a "star" player cannot
play on the date his team chose to play,
for various reasons and his absence re
sults in a one-sided loss. We have no
control, nor do we desire it. over who
plays when. In our opinion, intramur
als should be strictly voluntary.
Perhaps, one solution would be to
eliminate IM point standings. A sam
ple survey of 207 managers, at the end
of fall quarter, indicates that only eight
teams said that the elimination of IM
points would keep them from par
ticipating; 95 managers answered that
they'd keep on playing. A more com
prehensive study is currently under
way, and these results may mean the
elimination of IM points.
The IM Department has been
amazed and concerned at the cornpara
tivelv few "A" teams, as compared to
the number of "B" teams that voluntar
ily sign-up. As Diane suggests, we may
be forced to switch the better "B"
teams to "A" classification and the less
talented "As" to "B" status.

Berlin
I'd like to thank Elizabeth Pollock
for her article (Daily, Feb. 22) on the
Berlin campus closure. There is one
error, however, that merits correction.
The article contained the implication
that the Berlin program was closed,
this year, to meet the Overseas Studies
budget projection for 197H-79.
In fact, the program was officially

terminated last year; it remained open
this year only through "one-time"
funds from the Provost's office. With
renegotiation of the Villa Muthesius
rental contract and with the continu
ing University budget concerns, these
funds are no longer available past June
1977.
Each closure, even a rumored clo
sure. of an overseas campus creates
considerable uproar in the student
comrrVunity. The recent activities of
the "Save Cliveden Committee" pro
vide a good example. Such sentiments
are represented in the Academic
Council's Committee on Foreign
Study Programs (C-FSP) by two voting
student members, myself and one
other. However, such sentiment has
rather less input. I feel, into the Pro
vost's budget decisions.
Berlin is an area of critical impor
tance in international affairs, particu
larly in this era of disenchantment
with detente. The city of Berlin un
doubtedly values the political signifi
cance of Stanford's presence there
nearly as much as we value our expo
sure in Berlin to the interfacing of im
mense political forces.
In view of this, from a purely per
sonal viewpoint I urge the Provost and
the University as a whole to reconsider
the cost-effectiveness of an $80,000
program in such an historically impor
tant city. Berlin cannot be funded
within the current Overseas Studies
budget; "one-time" funds were once
found in general funds. Surely such
funds can be located again, some
where in the $300 million University
hudget.

Education's role
"But if you wont a different job where
you don't hove to write perfect your
just waisting time in a english or His
tory class when you could be taking o
class that trains you to do what you
want to do." -{Written by a ninth grade
school newspaper staffer)
The above quote reflects a growing
trend to demand relevance of our
schools. The position is that schools
should give students those skills
necessary for adequate performance in
a social niche.
Tied in with this form of vocational
education is the three R's movement
which demands basic skills for filling
out job applications, income tax forms,
freshman English exams, etc. The
claim is that no longer should we learn
science for science's sake, history for
history's sake or art for art's sake.
Rather, we should learn these subjects
for our sake.
Such subjects should be made relev
ant to the student, they should give
him or her the knowledge and skills
needed for the career they choose.
Mastery of the three R's and job appli
cation skills become of top priority in a
school system whose goals revolve
around preparing students for jobs or
places in a social system.
There is. however, a central aspect of
this type of rationale which is being
left unexamined. Notice that nothing
is said about ways students come to
choose these careers which the schools
are to prepare them for. Who deter
mines such choices? Are tbev deter
mined by a school counselor, by

socio-economic status, by IQ scores?
If so. it is certainly a misnomer to
call such activity "choice." On the
other hand, if we subscribe to the posi
tion that choise is involved, is it not the
responsibility of the schools to first
provide students with the knowledge
and skills needed to make personal
choices?
Is a ninth grader in a position to de
termine what type of career he wants?
Has he acquired the knowledge and
skills which will enable him to make
such a decision? And furthermore,
how effective can such a choice be in a
society which will not allow him or
her to fulfill it?
In short. I am not arguing here for a
particular position on this matter. My
point is that the three R's movement
and the advocates of vocational educa
tion have neglected the issue of how
student career goals are to be deter
mined. Recognizing and answering
this question is crucial if we are to get a
clear view of what schools as training
grounds really entails.

After three years at Stanford, it has
finally gotten through my thick skull:
Stanford is a university for students,
not a university of students. President
Richard Lyman has finally spelled it
out clearly for me in his warning to
students "not to interfere with the
conduct of the University" (Daily.
March 2).
Why couldn't I see it before? Ours is
a consumer society, a clientele society
in which people shop only for finished
products. We shop for everything —
including an education, a ready-made,
foolproof process for the manufacture
of lawyers, doctors, businessmen, etc.
Stanford is just such a process, an edu
cation which you buy as a finished
product.
The reason Stanford is so expensive
is that the process you're buying has
such an excellent reputation for suc
cess. The brand-name alone stamped
on your head is sometimes enough to
get you accepted in the right circles.
The problem is that while most
people are well-socialized — well
trained to accept finished products —
through somequirk of nature, thereare
always some people who escape com
plete socialization. These people still
refuse to shop for finished products
such as education.
instead of being passive objects of
the Stanford process once they have

paid their tuition, they want to he sub
jects. They want to take an active part
in what they see should be the constant
re-creation and improvement of the
University. They have the cra/v idea
that the University should he an ex
pression of students, faculty, and staff
working together as equals to further
knowledge and understanding.
These maladjusted individuals are
often viewed by the well-socialized as
the chronic-crabbers of the lunatic
fringe. Thus can they be dismissed as a
"silly" squeak in the Stanford process,
and the "rational thinking" can have
hope that someday the oil of socializa
tion will be able to reach into all the
cracks and crannies of society and end
that infernal noise.
Just think: If all institutions and
bureaucracies someday perfect their
processes, we will have a society in
which everyone is a nice, passive
shopper looking only for accepted
finished products. All we have to do is
kill creativity, individualism and ac
tivism!
As one of the "lunatic fringe." I feel it
only fair to warn all such dreamers: it
won't work. There will always be in
dividuals who refuse to be objects,
who will insist upon taking active part
in determining those processes which
affect their lives and those of their
children. And someday they will not
be regarded as "silly."

Jeff Dal Clerro should be commended
for his suggestion that the ASSU Se
nate "cut the comedy" (Daily Mar. 1).
There can be no doubt that a Senate
which plays jokes with student gov
ernment is indeed "sending them a
message."
It is impossible for the administra
tion to take t he Senate's ideas seriously
when manv of the members of the Se-

nate do not. It should lie remembered,
however, that some members of the
Senate do take student government
seriously. These senators should have
been given the praise they deserve,
even if their particular views do hap
pen to be objectionable.
In addition, although students are
transients, we should certainly get
more than a to be heard" for our
$25,000 investment. Hal Cerrountairh
attacks the competence of students
when he suggests that we are unable to
make major decisions.
The ASSU Senate and the COP
should have more than just an "influ
ence" in the university decision
making process. They should have an
equal weight with both the faculty and
the administration in deciding major
university issues. Dal Cerro should
keep in mind that the t Jniversity exists
for "transients" liks us. We are the
main customers of the education it
provides.

In response to Diane Long's letter
(Daily. Feb. 24). the Intramural De
partment is aware of the problem of
mismatched teams and welcomes
suggestions for its solution. Until a few
years ago. it was the department's pol
icy to group teams according to gen
eral classifications: fraternities,
dorms, graduates, etc.
Recently, we adopted "Instant
Scheduling" in each of the league
sports, which gives each team to
choose its level of ability, dates and
time preferences, etc. This has eased
the problem somewhat hut there still
remains mismatching.
Sometimes a "star" player cannot
play on the date his team chose to play,
for various reasons and his absence re
sults in a one-sided loss. We have no
control, nor do we desire it. over who
plays when. In our opinion, intramur
als should be strictly voluntary.
Perhaps, one solution would be to
eliminate IM point standings. A sam
ple survey of 207 managers, at the end
of fall quarter, indicates that only eight
teams said that the elimination of IM
points would keep them from par
ticipating; 95 managers answered that
they'd keep on playing. A more com
prehensive study is currently under
way, and these results may mean the
elimination of IM points.
The IM Department has been
amazed and concerned at the cornpara
tivelv few "A" teams, as compared to
the number of "B" teams that voluntar
ily sign-up. As Diane suggests, we may
be forced to switch the better "B"
teams to "A" classification and the less
talented "As" to "B" status.

Berlin
I'd like to thank Elizabeth Pollock
for her article (Daily, Feb. 22) on the
Berlin campus closure. There is one
error, however, that merits correction.
The article contained the implication
that the Berlin program was closed,
this year, to meet the Overseas Studies
budget projection for 197H-79.
In fact, the program was officially

terminated last year; it remained open
this year only through "one-time"
funds from the Provost's office. With
renegotiation of the Villa Muthesius
rental contract and with the continu
ing University budget concerns, these
funds are no longer available past June
1977.
Each closure, even a rumored clo
sure. of an overseas campus creates
considerable uproar in the student
comrrVunity. The recent activities of
the "Save Cliveden Committee" pro
vide a good example. Such sentiments
are represented in the Academic
Council's Committee on Foreign
Study Programs (C-FSP) by two voting
student members, myself and one
other. However, such sentiment has
rather less input. I feel, into the Pro
vost's budget decisions.
Berlin is an area of critical impor
tance in international affairs, particu
larly in this era of disenchantment
with detente. The city of Berlin un
doubtedly values the political signifi
cance of Stanford's presence there
nearly as much as we value our expo
sure in Berlin to the interfacing of im
mense political forces.
In view of this, from a purely per
sonal viewpoint I urge the Provost and
the University as a whole to reconsider
the cost-effectiveness of an $80,000
program in such an historically impor
tant city. Berlin cannot be funded
within the current Overseas Studies
budget; "one-time" funds were once
found in general funds. Surely such
funds can be located again, some
where in the $300 million University
hudget.

Education's role
"But if you wont a different job where
you don't hove to write perfect your
just waisting time in a english or His
tory class when you could be taking o
class that trains you to do what you
want to do." -{Written by a ninth grade
school newspaper staffer)
The above quote reflects a growing
trend to demand relevance of our
schools. The position is that schools
should give students those skills
necessary for adequate performance in
a social niche.
Tied in with this form of vocational
education is the three R's movement
which demands basic skills for filling
out job applications, income tax forms,
freshman English exams, etc. The
claim is that no longer should we learn
science for science's sake, history for
history's sake or art for art's sake.
Rather, we should learn these subjects
for our sake.
Such subjects should be made relev
ant to the student, they should give
him or her the knowledge and skills
needed for the career they choose.
Mastery of the three R's and job appli
cation skills become of top priority in a
school system whose goals revolve
around preparing students for jobs or
places in a social system.
There is. however, a central aspect of
this type of rationale which is being
left unexamined. Notice that nothing
is said about ways students come to
choose these careers which the schools
are to prepare them for. Who deter
mines such choices? Are tbev deter
mined by a school counselor, by

socio-economic status, by IQ scores?
If so. it is certainly a misnomer to
call such activity "choice." On the
other hand, if we subscribe to the posi
tion that choise is involved, is it not the
responsibility of the schools to first
provide students with the knowledge
and skills needed to make personal
choices?
Is a ninth grader in a position to de
termine what type of career he wants?
Has he acquired the knowledge and
skills which will enable him to make
such a decision? And furthermore,
how effective can such a choice be in a
society which will not allow him or
her to fulfill it?
In short. I am not arguing here for a
particular position on this matter. My
point is that the three R's movement
and the advocates of vocational educa
tion have neglected the issue of how
student career goals are to be deter
mined. Recognizing and answering
this question is crucial if we are to get a
clear view of what schools as training
grounds really entails.

Psychological warfare
On the current issue of the J.P. Ste
vens & Co., I am not puzzled at the
University's ambiguity toward the fac
tors I can identify: (1) management
em ploye-stockholder communication
on issues of compensation and work
ing conditions. (2) open disclosure of
same, (3) the legal right of employes to
"organize" for collective bargaining or
less formal means for candid interplay
of the employe and institution.
For more than two decades, as a stu
dent or University staff member — I
have been instructed quite directly as
to the unacceptability of attempts in
this direction by the University staff. I
have seen any number of competent,
engaged, and energetic staff members
laid-off or placed on a depressed salary
schedule — shortly after having at
tempted to implement courteous and
reasoned processes directed toward
finding out how employes might im
prove their own positions, achieve
equal treatment, protect their peers or
friends, etc.
The University has two standard
mechanisms for dealing with such
aberrant behavior among the staff —
nonresponse to inquiries or solicita
tions and psychological warfare.
These are instructive devices which
invariably preceed the direct coun
teractions described above.
The consequence of this environ
ment has been perplexity and frustra
tion among the staff, and a level of
psychic intimidation which stifles
risk-taking of any sort, slowing crea
tive accomplishment significantly in
my view.
A staff in this setting of intimidation
is necessarily forced to ask 112 rst what
actions are certain to satisfy the
bureaucratic command to keep one's
mouth shut, and only then to consider
one's job function.
I am frankly surprised to find the J.P.
Stevens Co. (whoever they might be) to
be the issue. My experience at Stanford
has been that employes "organize" en
tirely out of desperation, entirely due
to the repressive tactics to which they

are habitually subjected.
The organizers are the adminis
trators with their misguided inclina
tion to equate information-seeking
with immaturity and other personality
defects which deserve prejudicijl
treatment.
It is quite unrealistically idealistic to
think that either Stanford or J.P. Ste
vens are unusual. It is a fact, no less,
that I would be dismissed without exp
lanation for writing this letter any
where else. That is normal in
America. I have come to think that the
repression of free thought is a be
haviorist imoerative among our
species.
If you reversed the job function ot
administrators and workers, you
would have all the same problems;
only the name plates would change,
and the agonizing would persist
among all. Still it is nice to see some
consideration of the issue somewhere
in the world.

House announcing that it will occupy

To those who still feel we're totally

To those who've been supportive of

We feel the approval represents the
success of a grassroot University-wide

In response to Diane Long's letter
(Daily. Feb. 24). the Intramural De
partment is aware of the problem of
mismatched teams and welcomes
suggestions for its solution. Until a few
years ago. it was the department's pol
icy to group teams according to gen
eral classifications: fraternities,
dorms, graduates, etc.
Recently, we adopted "Instant
Scheduling" in each of the league
sports, which gives each team to
choose its level of ability, dates and
time preferences, etc. This has eased
the problem somewhat hut there still
remains mismatching.
Sometimes a "star" player cannot
play on the date his team chose to play,
for various reasons and his absence re
sults in a one-sided loss. We have no
control, nor do we desire it. over who
plays when. In our opinion, intramur
als should be strictly voluntary.
Perhaps, one solution would be to
eliminate IM point standings. A sam
ple survey of 207 managers, at the end
of fall quarter, indicates that only eight
teams said that the elimination of IM
points would keep them from par
ticipating; 95 managers answered that
they'd keep on playing. A more com
prehensive study is currently under
way, and these results may mean the
elimination of IM points.
The IM Department has been
amazed and concerned at the cornpara
tivelv few "A" teams, as compared to
the number of "B" teams that voluntar
ily sign-up. As Diane suggests, we may
be forced to switch the better "B"
teams to "A" classification and the less
talented "As" to "B" status.

I'd like to thank Elizabeth Pollock
for her article (Daily, Feb. 22) on the
Berlin campus closure. There is one
error, however, that merits correction.
The article contained the implication
that the Berlin program was closed,
this year, to meet the Overseas Studies
budget projection for 197H-79.
In fact, the program was officially

terminated last year; it remained open
this year only through "one-time"
funds from the Provost's office. With
renegotiation of the Villa Muthesius
rental contract and with the continu
ing University budget concerns, these
funds are no longer available past June
1977.
Each closure, even a rumored clo
sure. of an overseas campus creates
considerable uproar in the student
comrrVunity. The recent activities of
the "Save Cliveden Committee" pro
vide a good example. Such sentiments
are represented in the Academic
Council's Committee on Foreign
Study Programs (C-FSP) by two voting
student members, myself and one
other. However, such sentiment has
rather less input. I feel, into the Pro
vost's budget decisions.
Berlin is an area of critical impor
tance in international affairs, particu
larly in this era of disenchantment
with detente. The city of Berlin un
doubtedly values the political signifi
cance of Stanford's presence there
nearly as much as we value our expo
sure in Berlin to the interfacing of im
mense political forces.
In view of this, from a purely per
sonal viewpoint I urge the Provost and
the University as a whole to reconsider
the cost-effectiveness of an $80,000
program in such an historically impor
tant city. Berlin cannot be funded
within the current Overseas Studies
budget; "one-time" funds were once
found in general funds. Surely such
funds can be located again, some
where in the $300 million University
hudget.

Education's role
"But if you wont a different job where
you don't hove to write perfect your
just waisting time in a english or His
tory class when you could be taking o
class that trains you to do what you
want to do." -{Written by a ninth grade
school newspaper staffer)
The above quote reflects a growing
trend to demand relevance of our
schools. The position is that schools
should give students those skills
necessary for adequate performance in
a social niche.
Tied in with this form of vocational
education is the three R's movement
which demands basic skills for filling
out job applications, income tax forms,
freshman English exams, etc. The
claim is that no longer should we learn
science for science's sake, history for
history's sake or art for art's sake.
Rather, we should learn these subjects
for our sake.
Such subjects should be made relev
ant to the student, they should give
him or her the knowledge and skills
needed for the career they choose.
Mastery of the three R's and job appli
cation skills become of top priority in a
school system whose goals revolve
around preparing students for jobs or
places in a social system.
There is. however, a central aspect of
this type of rationale which is being
left unexamined. Notice that nothing
is said about ways students come to
choose these careers which the schools
are to prepare them for. Who deter
mines such choices? Are tbev deter
mined by a school counselor, by

socio-economic status, by IQ scores?
If so. it is certainly a misnomer to
call such activity "choice." On the
other hand, if we subscribe to the posi
tion that choise is involved, is it not the
responsibility of the schools to first
provide students with the knowledge
and skills needed to make personal
choices?
Is a ninth grader in a position to de
termine what type of career he wants?
Has he acquired the knowledge and
skills which will enable him to make
such a decision? And furthermore,
how effective can such a choice be in a
society which will not allow him or
her to fulfill it?
In short. I am not arguing here for a
particular position on this matter. My
point is that the three R's movement
and the advocates of vocational educa
tion have neglected the issue of how
student career goals are to be deter
mined. Recognizing and answering
this question is crucial if we are to get a
clear view of what schools as training
grounds really entails.

Psychological warfare
On the current issue of the J.P. Ste
vens & Co., I am not puzzled at the
University's ambiguity toward the fac
tors I can identify: (1) management
em ploye-stockholder communication
on issues of compensation and work
ing conditions. (2) open disclosure of
same, (3) the legal right of employes to
"organize" for collective bargaining or
less formal means for candid interplay
of the employe and institution.
For more than two decades, as a stu
dent or University staff member — I
have been instructed quite directly as
to the unacceptability of attempts in
this direction by the University staff. I
have seen any number of competent,
engaged, and energetic staff members
laid-off or placed on a depressed salary
schedule — shortly after having at
tempted to implement courteous and
reasoned processes directed toward
finding out how employes might im
prove their own positions, achieve
equal treatment, protect their peers or
friends, etc.
The University has two standard
mechanisms for dealing with such
aberrant behavior among the staff —
nonresponse to inquiries or solicita
tions and psychological warfare.
These are instructive devices which
invariably preceed the direct coun
teractions described above.
The consequence of this environ
ment has been perplexity and frustra
tion among the staff, and a level of
psychic intimidation which stifles
risk-taking of any sort, slowing crea
tive accomplishment significantly in
my view.
A staff in this setting of intimidation
is necessarily forced to ask 112 rst what
actions are certain to satisfy the
bureaucratic command to keep one's
mouth shut, and only then to consider
one's job function.
I am frankly surprised to find the J.P.
Stevens Co. (whoever they might be) to
be the issue. My experience at Stanford
has been that employes "organize" en
tirely out of desperation, entirely due
to the repressive tactics to which they

are habitually subjected.
The organizers are the adminis
trators with their misguided inclina
tion to equate information-seeking
with immaturity and other personality
defects which deserve prejudicijl
treatment.
It is quite unrealistically idealistic to
think that either Stanford or J.P. Ste
vens are unusual. It is a fact, no less,
that I would be dismissed without exp
lanation for writing this letter any
where else. That is normal in
America. I have come to think that the
repression of free thought is a be
haviorist imoerative among our
species.
If you reversed the job function ot
administrators and workers, you
would have all the same problems;
only the name plates would change,
and the agonizing would persist
among all. Still it is nice to see some
consideration of the issue somewhere
in the world.

The Office of Residential Education
approved the proposal for Androgyny
House announcing that it will occupy
the residence of Jordan House. To the
present residents of Jordan, we are
sorry to be dispossessing you or any
one, and hope that new arrangements
can be satisfactorily made.
To those who still feel we're totally
off-base with the whole idea, come by
sometime next year and we can talk
about just what has and hasn't hap
pened.
To those who've been supportive of
the project and helpful throughout the
last two months, those who signed pet
itions and wrote letters, and the Daily
which provided such an excellent
forum for discussion, the project is to
tally indebted. This was a difficult un
dertaking from the start, organized
only by an impromptu group.
We feel the approval represents the
success of a grassroot University-wide
movement, crossing disciplines and
perspectives, with only a common ex
citement and even curiosity perhaps in
seeing what a residence group or
ganized to explore sex roles and sex
role-related issues will discover of
learning and ways of learning, and
eventually about itself as a commun

Active participation
After three years at Stanford, it has
finally gotten through my thick skull:
Stanford is a university for students,
not a university of students. President
Richard Lyman has finally spelled it
out clearly for me in his warning to
students "not to interfere with the
conduct of the University" (Daily.
March 2).
Why couldn't I see it before? Ours is
a consumer society, a clientele society
in which people shop only for finished
products. We shop for everything —
including an education, a ready-made,
foolproof process for the manufacture
of lawyers, doctors, businessmen, etc.
Stanford is just such a process, an edu
cation which you buy as a finished
product.
The reason Stanford is so expensive
is that the process you're buying has
such an excellent reputation for suc
cess. The brand-name alone stamped
on your head is sometimes enough to
get you accepted in the right circles.
The problem is that while most
people are well-socialized — well
trained to accept finished products —
through somequirk of nature, thereare
always some people who escape com
plete socialization. These people still
refuse to shop for finished products
such as education.
instead of being passive objects of
the Stanford process once they have

paid their tuition, they want to he sub
jects. They want to take an active part
in what they see should be the constant
re-creation and improvement of the
University. They have the cra/v idea
that the University should he an ex
pression of students, faculty, and staff
working together as equals to further
knowledge and understanding.
These maladjusted individuals are
often viewed by the well-socialized as
the chronic-crabbers of the lunatic
fringe. Thus can they be dismissed as a
"silly" squeak in the Stanford process,
and the "rational thinking" can have
hope that someday the oil of socializa
tion will be able to reach into all the
cracks and crannies of society and end
that infernal noise.
Just think: If all institutions and
bureaucracies someday perfect their
processes, we will have a society in
which everyone is a nice, passive
shopper looking only for accepted
finished products. All we have to do is
kill creativity, individualism and ac
tivism!
As one of the "lunatic fringe." I feel it
only fair to warn all such dreamers: it
won't work. There will always be in
dividuals who refuse to be objects,
who will insist upon taking active part
in determining those processes which
affect their lives and those of their
children. And someday they will not
be regarded as "silly."

Student voice
Jeff Dal Clerro should be commended
for his suggestion that the ASSU Se
nate "cut the comedy" (Daily Mar. 1).
There can be no doubt that a Senate
which plays jokes with student gov
ernment is indeed "sending them a
message."
It is impossible for the administra
tion to take t he Senate's ideas seriously
when manv of the members of the Se-

nate do not. It should lie remembered,
however, that some members of the
Senate do take student government
seriously. These senators should have
been given the praise they deserve,
even if their particular views do hap
pen to be objectionable.
In addition, although students are
transients, we should certainly get
more than a to be heard" for our
$25,000 investment. Hal Cerrountairh
attacks the competence of students
when he suggests that we are unable to
make major decisions.
The ASSU Senate and the COP
should have more than just an "influ
ence" in the university decision
making process. They should have an
equal weight with both the faculty and
the administration in deciding major
university issues. Dal Cerro should
keep in mind that the t Jniversity exists
