# Stanford Daily Opinions
## Moral endowment 
### 
Anne Henkels

President Richard Lyman could not
have been more correct in stating that
the I Jniversity must consider its moral
responsibility to "use its endowment
for the purpose set forward in the
founding grant." (Daily. March 4).
That is exactly the idea Mr. and Mrs.
Leland Stanford had in 1885 when
they generously turned over to the
University trustees the extensive
property and wealth they had accumu
lated through clever railroad enter
prising. However, I think the Stanfords
would have been a bit surprised to hear
the President's interpretation of the
"purpose set forward in the founding
grant."
According to Lyman. "... the Uni
versity has a moral obligation to
maximize the benefit to itself of the
endowment because the endowment
exists to serve the University, which
exists to serve educational research."
Assuming Lyman has been correctly
quoted. I think the President had better
visit the University Archives, and re
view the actual documents before he
interprets them. (Otherwise he may
"oversimplify" or interpret them too
"narrowly." as he suggested students
are prone to do.) But in case the Presi
dent hasn't the time for such research,
let me quote the Stanfords here:
I he moving spirit of the Founders
in the foundation and endowment of
the Leland Stanford Junior University
was the love of humanity and a desire
to render the greatest possible service
to mankind. The University was ac
cordingly designed for the betterment
ot mankind morally, spiritually, intel
lectually. physically, and materially.
The public at large, and not alone the
comparatively few students who can
attend the I Jniversity. are the rhief and
ultimate beneficiaries of the found.)
tion."
I hat's a little different from"the en
dowment exists to serve the University
which exists to serve educational re
search."
When tfie Stanfords said that the
"public .it large . . . are the chief and
ultimate beneficiaries of the founda
tion." I don't suppose they were think
ing specifically of the J.P. Stevens
workers. However, |.P. Stevens work
ers are undeniably members of the
"public at large." Furthermore, in the
same document the Stanfords state
"...and its (the University's) pur

poses (are) to promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence in be
half of humanity . . . teaching the bles
sings of liberty regulated by law, and
inculcating love and reverence for the
great principles of government ..."
In abstaining from using its proper
stockholder's influence "in behalf of
humanity" to help bring the nation's
number one violator of the NLRA to
justice. 1 question what the University
administration was teaching students.
