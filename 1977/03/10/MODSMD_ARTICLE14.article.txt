Single parenthood is here to stay.
Divorce is the most common cause
of single parenthood, but spouse death
and single parent adoptions are also
contributing factors. Motherhood
without maternity, in which a woman
chooses to give birth without marrying
the child's father, is on the rise, and
may soon equal divorce as a cause ol
single parenthood.
The values which once caused soci
ety to condemn the single parent fam
ily have changed as the trend toward
this domestic form increases. While
the nuclear family still is the favored
and desired grouping, single parents
are at last being accepted as normal
people. Pressures to re-marry are eas
ing up on the divorced parent, and il
legitimacy and its stigma has gone the

way Of the dinosaurs.
T'jis does not mean, however, that
single parents receive society's bles
sing ,ui(i support. Instead, single pa
rents have to survive in a culture in
which the dual parent family is still
the norm. Single parent families have
speu.il needs and problems which

society does not support or help to
solve.
Parenthood, even in the traditional
dual parent family, is no easy task.
Rearing children successfully, which

includes nurturing, counseling, com
forting, instructing and disciplining,
requires vast resources of patience,
knowledge and energy.
Add to this the responsibilities of
wage earning, bill paying, cleaning,
cooking and providing family recrea
tion, and you have a picture of what
the world of the single parent is like.
Society offers no relief for the crushing
weight of the burden.
In practice, the duties shared by two
adults in the dual parent family must
be assumed by one person in the.single
parent family. Completing all these
tasks becomes nearly impossible when
no other family members are accessi
ble, such as grandparents and aunts
and uncles. The demands on her time
and abilities are great, and it is the rare
person who feels she is successfully
meeting all of them.
For women who are single parents,
financial problems are especially bur
densome. Unlike most of her male
counterparts, the female single parent
is relegated to the lowest echelons of
employment. This is. of course, not
due to her marital status, but to the fact
that she is a woman worker. The
female executive is still rare, and the
female executive who is also a single
parent is even rarer.
Discrimination in employment and
pay keep most single parents at or not
far above the poverty level. Many re
ceive welfare as their only income.
Others, because their full-time earn
ings are so low, are eligible for partial
welfare stipends, food stamps and
subsidized medical care.
But even these benefits do not place
the single parent family in economic
competition with most dual parent
families. It is still common for the
single parent to wear clothes from five
years ago. to deprive herself for the
children's benefit, to forego personal
entertainment and resign herselt to a
future very similar to her present cir
cumstances.
The working single parent and the
student single parent who is in college
to provide a better future for her family
are faced with a critical lack of
adequate child care facilities. Child
care for the extremely indigent, e.g..
those on welfare or those who earn
bare subsistence wages, is free, but the
waiting lists are extremely long. The
agencies providingtheservices charge
fees on a sliding scale which takes a
sharp upward swing as income from
employment increases. According to
current scales, the parent who grosses
$700 per month (netting perhapsssoo)
is charged over $200 per month for
child care. Private care is also exhor
bitant, averaging anywhere from $150
to $250 per month.
The alternatives for the single parent
who cannot afford such fees are to quit
work and live (if it can be called that)

on welfare, or resign herself to tin* fact
that her children will he without
supervision for large portions of the
day while she is at work.
In addition, most single parents
must satisfy themselves with less than
adequate housing, clothing and nntri
tion. The children must content them
selves to do without the luxuries en
joyed by their peers.
The frustrations and pressures
single parent families endure art; tre
mendous. But the trend toward single
parenthood is continuing. Despite
physical, financial and emotional de
privation, more and more parents are
rejecting marriage.
This can be accounted for in part by
a growing skepticism that marriage is a
desirable goal. Among feminists, the
saying, "A woman without a man is
like a fish without a bicycle" sums up
the attitude that a man is not necessary
for anything a woman wants to do. in
cluding raising a family. Single
parenthood develops independence;
and initiative, traits which many
women feel are suffocated by mar
riage. More and more women .ire un
willing to "bail themselves out"
through marriage. As one woman re
cently put it. "Why exchange one bad
situation for another?" For those who
don't believe single parenthood is
"had," the question becomes. "Why
exchange a known situation for an 1111
known?"
Moreover, the phenomenon of men
accepting single parenthood is on the
increase. As sex roles of the past are
discarded by a society in which they
are now obsolete, men are coming to
realize that they are as capable of nur
ture and tenderness as women, and
that their parenting role can go beyond
dispensing punishment for their chil
dren's offenses.
There are those who predict that
single parenthood will be the norm by
the year 2000, and that the traditional
family will disappear as did the ex
tended family of the last century. This
forecast could easily come true if mar
riage as an institution does not change
radically â€” and soon.

Add to this the responsibilities of
wage earning, bill paying, cleaning,
cooking and providing family recrea
tion, and you have a picture of what
the world of the single parent is like.
Society offers no relief for the crushing
weight of the burden.
In practice, the duties shared by two
adults in the dual parent family must
be assumed by one person in the.single
parent family. Completing all these
tasks becomes nearly impossible when
no other family members are accessi
ble, such as grandparents and aunts
and uncles. The demands on her time
and abilities are great, and it is the rare
person who feels she is successfully
meeting all of them.
For women who are single parents,
financial problems are especially bur
densome. Unlike most of her male
counterparts, the female single parent
is relegated to the lowest echelons of
employment. This is. of course, not
due to her marital status, but to the fact
that she is a woman worker. The
female executive is still rare, and the
female executive who is also a single
parent is even rarer.
Discrimination in employment and
pay keep most single parents at or not
far above the poverty level. Many re
ceive welfare as their only income.
Others, because their full-time earn
ings are so low, are eligible for partial
welfare stipends, food stamps and
subsidized medical care.
But even these benefits do not place
the single parent family in economic
competition with most dual parent
families. It is still common for the
single parent to wear clothes from five
years ago. to deprive herself for the
children's benefit, to forego personal
entertainment and resign herselt to a
future very similar to her present cir
cumstances.
The working single parent and the
student single parent who is in college
to provide a better future for her family
are faced with a critical lack of
adequate child care facilities. Child
care for the extremely indigent, e.g..
those on welfare or those who earn
bare subsistence wages, is free, but the
waiting lists are extremely long. The
agencies providingtheservices charge
fees on a sliding scale which takes a
sharp upward swing as income from
employment increases. According to
current scales, the parent who grosses
$700 per month (netting perhapsssoo)
is charged over $200 per month for
child care. Private care is also exhor
bitant, averaging anywhere from $150
to $250 per month.
The alternatives for the single parent
who cannot afford such fees are to quit
work and live (if it can be called that)

on welfare, or resign herself to tin* fact
that her children will he without
supervision for large portions of the
day while she is at work.
In addition, most single parents
must satisfy themselves with less than
adequate housing, clothing and nntri
tion. The children must content them
selves to do without the luxuries en
joyed by their peers.
The frustrations and pressures
single parent families endure art; tre
mendous. But the trend toward single
parenthood is continuing. Despite
physical, financial and emotional de
privation, more and more parents are
rejecting marriage.
This can be accounted for in part by
a growing skepticism that marriage is a
desirable goal. Among feminists, the
saying, "A woman without a man is
like a fish without a bicycle" sums up
the attitude that a man is not necessary
for anything a woman wants to do. in
cluding raising a family. Single
parenthood develops independence;
and initiative, traits which many
women feel are suffocated by mar
riage. More and more women .ire un
willing to "bail themselves out"
through marriage. As one woman re
cently put it. "Why exchange one bad
situation for another?" For those who
don't believe single parenthood is
"had," the question becomes. "Why
exchange a known situation for an 1111
known?"
Moreover, the phenomenon of men
accepting single parenthood is on the
increase. As sex roles of the past are
discarded by a society in which they
are now obsolete, men are coming to
realize that they are as capable of nur
ture and tenderness as women, and
that their parenting role can go beyond
dispensing punishment for their chil
dren's offenses.
There are those who predict that
single parenthood will be the norm by
the year 2000, and that the traditional
family will disappear as did the ex
tended family of the last century. This
forecast could easily come true if mar
riage as an institution does not change
radically â€” and soon.

children's benefit, to forego personal
entertainment and resign herselt to a
future very similar to her present cir
cumstances.
The working single parent and the
student single parent who is in college
to provide a better future for her family
are faced with a critical lack of
adequate child care facilities. Child
care for the extremely indigent, e.g..
those on welfare or those who earn
bare subsistence wages, is free, but the
waiting lists are extremely long. The
agencies providingtheservices charge
fees on a sliding scale which takes a
sharp upward swing as income from
employment increases. According to
current scales, the parent who grosses
$700 per month (netting perhapsssoo)
is charged over $200 per month for
child care. Private care is also exhor
bitant, averaging anywhere from $150
to $250 per month.
The alternatives for the single parent
who cannot afford such fees are to quit
work and live (if it can be called that)

on welfare, or resign herself to tin* fact
that her children will he without
supervision for large portions of the
day while she is at work.
In addition, most single parents
must satisfy themselves with less than
adequate housing, clothing and nntri
tion. The children must content them
selves to do without the luxuries en
joyed by their peers.
The frustrations and pressures
single parent families endure art; tre
mendous. But the trend toward single
parenthood is continuing. Despite
physical, financial and emotional de
privation, more and more parents are
rejecting marriage.
This can be accounted for in part by
a growing skepticism that marriage is a
desirable goal. Among feminists, the
saying, "A woman without a man is
like a fish without a bicycle" sums up
the attitude that a man is not necessary
for anything a woman wants to do. in
cluding raising a family. Single
parenthood develops independence;
and initiative, traits which many
women feel are suffocated by mar
riage. More and more women .ire un
willing to "bail themselves out"
through marriage. As one woman re
cently put it. "Why exchange one bad
situation for another?" For those who
don't believe single parenthood is
"had," the question becomes. "Why
exchange a known situation for an 1111
known?"
Moreover, the phenomenon of men
accepting single parenthood is on the
increase. As sex roles of the past are
discarded by a society in which they
are now obsolete, men are coming to
realize that they are as capable of nur
ture and tenderness as women, and
that their parenting role can go beyond
dispensing punishment for their chil
dren's offenses.
There are those who predict that
single parenthood will be the norm by
the year 2000, and that the traditional
family will disappear as did the ex
tended family of the last century. This
forecast could easily come true if mar
riage as an institution does not change
radically â€” and soon.

rents are women, the pronouns "she
and "her" will be used in this discus

specified.)
Single parenthood is here to stay.
Divorce is the most common cause
of single parenthood, but spouse death
and single parent adoptions are also
contributing factors. Motherhood
without maternity, in which a woman
chooses to give birth without marrying
the child's father, is on the rise, and
may soon equal divorce as a cause ol
single parenthood.
The values which once caused soci
ety to condemn the single parent fam
ily have changed as the trend toward
this domestic form increases. While
the nuclear family still is the favored
and desired grouping, single parents
are at last being accepted as normal
people. Pressures to re-marry are eas
ing up on the divorced parent, and il
legitimacy and its stigma has gone the

way Of the dinosaurs.
T'jis does not mean, however, that
single parents receive society's bles
sing ,ui(i support. Instead, single pa
rents have to survive in a culture in
which the dual parent family is still
the norm. Single parent families have
speu.il needs and problems which

society does not support or help to
solve.
Parenthood, even in the traditional
dual parent family, is no easy task.
Rearing children successfully, which

includes nurturing, counseling, com
forting, instructing and disciplining,
requires vast resources of patience,
knowledge and energy.
Add to this the responsibilities of
wage earning, bill paying, cleaning,
cooking and providing family recrea
tion, and you have a picture of what
the world of the single parent is like.
Society offers no relief for the crushing
weight of the burden.
In practice, the duties shared by two
adults in the dual parent family must
be assumed by one person in the.single
parent family. Completing all these
tasks becomes nearly impossible when
no other family members are accessi
ble, such as grandparents and aunts
and uncles. The demands on her time
and abilities are great, and it is the rare
person who feels she is successfully
meeting all of them.
For women who are single parents,
financial problems are especially bur
densome. Unlike most of her male
counterparts, the female single parent
is relegated to the lowest echelons of
employment. This is. of course, not
due to her marital status, but to the fact
that she is a woman worker. The
female executive is still rare, and the
female executive who is also a single
parent is even rarer.
Discrimination in employment and
pay keep most single parents at or not
far above the poverty level. Many re
ceive welfare as their only income.
Others, because their full-time earn
ings are so low, are eligible for partial
welfare stipends, food stamps and
subsidized medical care.
But even these benefits do not place
the single parent family in economic
competition with most dual parent
families. It is still common for the
single parent to wear clothes from five
years ago. to deprive herself for the
children's benefit, to forego personal
entertainment and resign herselt to a
future very similar to her present cir
cumstances.
