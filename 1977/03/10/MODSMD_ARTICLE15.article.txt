Please find out how many students are enrolled
at Stanford n ho are from New York City. Include
undergraduates in till schools, students in the Bus
iness School, Law School. Medical School and all
other graduate students.
Could you give this figure us u percentage of
tot(d students.
This is important -a trip to Hawaii is the wager
on a bet!

I would have never guessed the answer to this
one in a million years! Would you believe th.it out
of a total of 12.t)H;i enrolled here, only 70 are from
New York City? That's just over one half of one per
cent.
Now before you get hysterical about having to
pay for a trip to Hawaii, let me explain how this
was computed. The figure is based on what stu
dents put on their autumn quarter I'TRs (you
know, those confusing green registration forms).
So. even if someone is from New York City hut
they put down another home address, they obvi
ously didn't get counted. And also keep in mind
that amount refers to people from the City of New
York, not New York State.
My thanks to statistician (o Riolo in the Regis
trar's Office, who had to do some extra homework
to come up with this.
Why does the Credit Union use such a bizarre
way of computing interest? They essentially pa\
interest on your minimum balance over a quarter,
while most other institutions seem to use daily
interest.
The Credit Union's system is very hard on u
person who is rich at the beginning of a quarter
and very poor by the end. Is there some law requir
ing their po/icv, or is it a ( lever rip-off?
-T.L.H.
Essentially, yes. there is a law requiring their
policy, since the Credit Union is regulated by the
Feds. According to branch manager Sharon
Bruntz, the federal government gives them the op
tion of paying their dividends on either an annual,
semi-annual, or quarterly basis. And they decided
to go with what t hey thought was the best program
paying on a quarterly basis.
Bruntz did have a suggestion, however. She said

By Vilia Kakis

rather than taking your money out in the middle or
the end of a quarter, keep it in as collateral, and
wait until the beginning of the next quarter to take
it out. That way you won't lose your quarterly
dividend.
If I've lost anybody in the course of my explana
tion. it could be because you don't know just what
the Credit I Jnion is. The Credit I Jnion is a loaning
service, and any graduate student or Stanford
employe is eligible to join.
By the way, as far as quarterly dividends and
daily interest are concerned, the difference is only
a matter of a few cents.
