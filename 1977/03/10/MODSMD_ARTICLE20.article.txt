# Portraits of Stanford's Students:
## 
### 
I originally planned to do my
photo essay on art at Stanford,
but when looking at the Claw one
day, that tarnished appendage
which graces White Plaza, I de
cided not to depress you. Such is
our school. I chose people, be
cause people are interesting to
everyone. They reflect ourselves,
and we all love to look in mirrors.
