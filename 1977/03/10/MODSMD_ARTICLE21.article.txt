## Murry's 41 points break record Cal beats Cards in rematch 
### Chris Baker 
Berkeley—lf last Thursday's
85-66 Stanford victory over Cal
was the Mike Bratz show, then
the Bears' 101-91 victory over
Stanford last Saturday was the
Ray Murry show.
Murry, a 6-foot-5, 235-pound
forward, saved his best for his
final collegiate basketball game.
The strong man scored 41
points, on 15 of 20 from the field
and 11 of 17 from the line, to set a
Harmon Gym record for most
points.
But Stanford almost spoiled
the show.
With 1:58 left to play in the
game the Cards, who trailed by
12 points early in the second
half, had closed to two points —
82-80 — on Wolfe Perry's follow
shot.
Technical foul
Cal guard Gene Ranson
brought the ball up court under
heavy pressure and referee Jack
Ditty whistled a foul on Card
guard Darryle Morgan.
Ditty's call brought Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso to his feet
and the veteran Pacific-8 official

handed Dißiaso a technical.
Ransom made both his foul
shots and Murry sank both tech
nical shots and Cal also got the
ball back. Morgan fouled Ran
som again and the 5-9 sopho
more guard sank two more free
throws to give the Dears an 88-80
lead with 1:34 left. Cal had
scored 6 points in 11 seconds.
"It (the technical) was well
earned," said Dißiaso after the
game. "Obviously, 1 disagreed
with the call. It came at the
wrong time. Our guys were mak
ing a great comeback.
'Untimely'
"It was ultimely and it took the
wind out of our sails." A reporter
asked Dißiaso what he thought
of the officiating this year. "You
cari't play the game without
them," he said diplomatically.
Murry finished his college
career with two slam dunks to
help put Cal over the 100-point
mark for the 10th time since
1950.
After the game Cal coach Dick
Edwards said, "Records are
great. 1 was delighted to see him
get it. I can't think of a better way

to end a career.
"I didn't know he had a shot at
the record until he was at the free
throw line."
Big improvement
Murry, who transfered to Cal
last season, showed almost as
much improvement over last
year as Cal, which finished the
year with a 7-7 Pac-8 mark and
12-15 overall mark.
"Going out this way is great,"
said Murry. "1 had the hot hand
tonight. I heard at halftime I was
pretty hot (25 points)."
But while Cal got a super per
formance from Murry, the Bears
also got an excellent game out of
6-11 center Tom Schneiderjohn.
The sophomore scored 24 points
and grabbed 12 rebounds. Ran
som, who scored only two points
in the first meeting, came back to
score 16 points. He also passed
off for 10 assists.
The Cards got excellent efforts
from Mike Bratz, Kimberly Bel
ton and Wolfe Perry.
Final game
Playing his final collegiate
game, Bratz scored 25 points and

passed off for five assists. "I've
had a few contacts from the pros
and I'll keep working on my
game," said Bratz.
Dißiaso also had some words
for the members of the NorCal
basketball writers association
who didn't give Bratz a spot on
the All-NorCal squad.
"I thought Mike Bratz' per
formance the last two games
showed how narrow minded the
Bay Area media and coaches
are," said Dißiaso. Bratz did earn
Pac-8 first team honors though.
Hope for future
Belton and Perry gave Stan
ford fans something to look for
ward to next season. Belton
scored a season-high 24 points
and pulled down a career-high
18 missed shots. Perry scored 17
points on eight of 15 from the
field and one of three from the
line.
"I thought Bratz, Belton and
Perry all had excellent games,"
Dißiaso said. "I think Kimberly
Belton's last four games have
shown his potential."
Belton, probably the best
freshman in the Pac-8 along with
OSU center Steve Johnson, was
30-60 from the field in those last
four games against UCLA, (JSC
and Cal. He averaged 18 points
and 12.5 rebounds.
Bratz, who finished the season
with 528 points, moved into
fourth place in season points be
hind Claude Terry's 1972-total
of 531. He also ranks 14th in
career scoring with 983.
Cardinal notes . . . Pac-8 bas
ketball drew 450,000 fans this
year . . . UCLA led the league in
attendance with
86,949 . . . Stanford finished
sixth with 41,051 fans.
