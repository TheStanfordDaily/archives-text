# Injuries hampered Stanford basketball season
## 
### David Georgette 
Jay Carter went up for a rebound
against Washington State in Stanford's
Pacific-8 opener at Pullman.
Stanford had a 7-3 record prior to its
conference tip-off. Despite the pre
season loss of the team's returning top
scorer, forward George Schader, to a
freak knee injury, the Cards had shown
over their first ten games that the
necessary adjustments had been made
and prospects for a fruitful conference
crusade looked good.
Two months later at Berkeley, Cal
forward Ray Murry flew in on a drive
and slammed the ball through the
hoop while being fouled by Kimberly
Belton. The Bear fans went bananas.
Murry's free throw made it Cal 99,
Stanford 89.
3-11 Pac-8
Seventeen seconds later the Cards
finished their conference season with
an 3-11 mark, 11-16 overall. Since the
6-foot-4 Carter had gone up for that
rebound, and strained the arch in his
foot when he had come back down,
Stanford had won only four of 17 bas
ketball games.
Why? Did Stanford have an easy
non-conference slate? Were there too
many injuries? Were there uninspired
performances? Why the big turn
around — for the worst? ,
"It's obvious that the loss of Jay Car
ter and injuries to key people kept us
from playing to our full potential,"
said Card coach DickDißiaso. Because
of the line-up reshuffling necessitated

by injuries, "We couldn't develop one
style of play," added Dißiaso.
With a healthy Carter, the Cards had
ccme from way behind to defeat
Nevada-Reno, 88-83, dropped Wis
consin, 70-66, and enjoyed a very suc
cessful Christmas junket. The season
opening embarrassing loss to Cal Poly
had been forgotten.
Non-conference
Had the opposition of the non
conference line-up been sufficient to
prepare Stanford for the Pac-8 season?

Season analysis

Dißiaso said, "The Pacific-8 is much
better." But, he added, "We thought it
(the non-conference schedule) pre
pared us for what we wanted it to."
Without Carter and his 10 point per
game average, the Cards lost in the last
few minutes to Washington State,
80-68 — a portent of things to come.
And then Stanford was blown out by
Washington.
"Carter's loss showed our lack of
depth, our depth and inexperience,"
said Dißiaso.
The Cards' youth showed through
their entire line-up, except for one
spot. That was the guard slot occupied
by senior Mike Bratz. But even in
Bratz' case, it was only his second year
in Dißiaso's system.
Post position
Jeff McHugh, who is only 6-BV2,
played the post position for most of the

season. He had seen little action in a
reserve role the year before.
For Wolfe Perry, the other healthy
returner who started, it was only his
first full year in the beginning five.
Inexperience was especially evident
with McHugh's frontcourt mates. Two
freshmen, 6-6V2 Kimberly Belton and
6-lOV2 Tom Schmalzried, carried the
bulk of the frontcourt play. Belton's
lack of an outside shot and Schmal
zried's tendency to get into foul trou
ble hampered the freshmen's effec-

tiveness.
Mark Fitzner, another forward,
could be counted on to come in some
times and supply some outside shoot
ing, but his board play was limited by
his size (6-7V 2 , 210).
'Defensive quickness'
Those two games in the Northwest
pointed out two things which the ab
sence of Carter precipitated. One qual
ity missing was, as Dißiaso said, "de
fensive quickness" in the front court.
The Cards were without anyone who
could keep up with the likes of Greg
Ballard, Marques Johnson and Don
Smith.
The other was that "We had to adopt
another personality," said Dißiaso.
"We had just started to believe in our
selves. Early, when we had the time,
we went with the four-corner offense
with Jay as guard."

Without a consistently effective
four-corner offense, the Cards had
trouble "getting the game down to the
last six minutes. We weren't able to
control the tempo. It became difficult
to maintain control of the game," said
DiBiaso.
Bratz, the Pac-8's fourth leading
scorer, agreed. "I don't want to make
excuses," he said, but with Carter out,
"We were definitely a changed team."
Home opener
The ingredients were present, then,
for a disastrous season. But the Pac-8
home opener against USC, which saw
a Card comeback late in the game to
pull out a 68-74 win, temporarily hid
the latent shortcomings of the squad.
A superb first-half performance
against UCLA two nights later and a
lackluster win against Hawaii a few
days later still offered hope for a win
ning campaign.
Stanford's capabilities for absorbing
adversity had been stretched to the
limit, however, by the injury to Carter,
the club's second-leading re
bounder. If anything else went wrong,
the Cards could snap like a too tightly
stretched rubber band.
Air Force loss
And that's exactly what happened
when Stanford traveled to the Rockies
for games against Air Force and Utah
State. Perry sprained his ankle in prac
tice on Tuesday, McHugh sprained his
ankle Wednesday in practice, and
Thursday, Air Force, a team with a
4-1 1 record, knocked off the Cards. 69-62.
"Air Force was probably the most disap
pointing loss of the season," said Dißiaso.
Against Utah State, the Cards were unable to
stay in the game and were run out of Logan,
103-84.
Up until these two losses, "We had over
come adversity and talked our way around
it," said Dißiaso.
It is certainly not a sign of strength if the
absence of one player, particularly a non
center, can make such a large difference in
the performance of a team. But with a lack of
depth to begin with, the injuries, especially
Carter's, inflamed an already dangerous
situation and make the performance of each
starter even more vital. "One player would
have a poor night and we were in trouble,"
said Dißiaso.
For instance, though Bratz played out
standing ball for most of the year, his points
were sorely missed during the two Oregon
contests in which he was effectively shut
down.
Dißiaso tried everything. He used man
to-man defense, a one-three-one zone with
Belton on the point to enable him to crash the
boards, strategic substituting to get a good
shooter in when the Cards went on offense,
and even going with a three-guard line-up
against teams with small forwards like
Washington and Oregon State.
Stanford's victory against Washington
supplied some very much needed relief in
the Cardinal locker room. With the triumph,
Stanford surpassed its victory output of the
previous season.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Di-
Biaso. "I never thought we'd budge from
nine."
Fleeting win
But the relief supplied by the Washington
triumph was fleeting, for over the next three
games the Cards' performances were marred
by a lack of intensity on defense or a lack of
execution on offense.
And whereas in the earlier losses the in
jury situation or the superior play of the
other team had been given as the reason for
the outcome, in the losses to Washington
State at Maples Pavilion and to UCLA and
USC, Dißiaso blamed the lack of perfor

mance by the Cards as a primary cause for the
wide margins of defeat.
A season that looked to be very long back
in the January had by the end of February
turned into unending frustrations.
A season-ending split with Cal, though,
soothed some of pains of the Los Angeles
experiences. After the Cal game on
Saturday, Dißiaso said; "Kimberly Belton in
the last four games of the season showed the
potential he has to be an outstanding Pac-8
player."
Belton called the season a "learning ex
perience."
The other youngster on the team, Tom
Schmalzried, Dißiaso said, "played well, or
gained valuable experience." Dißiaso went
on to say that Schmalzried started to be effec
tive in "things that don't show up statisti
cally."
The improved play of the freshmen,
though, was overshadowed by the consistent
performance throughout the year by the
Cards' backcourt. Perry and Bratz, as Dißiaso
said, "are as good a combination as you
could find in the conference." It's no coinci
dence that the backcourt was most experi
enced part of the team.
Of course, the team's overall record this
season did improve over last year's. But then
again, last year, the Cards lost 11 games by
six points or less. This year, they lost only
one game by six points or less. They won five
games by six points or less.
No depth
This season, the Cards clearly did not have
the depth or the developed talent, especially
in the front court, to hold their own against
the tough competition in the Pac-8, "the
strongest conference in the country," ac
cording to Dißiaso.
Whether the Cards have the untapped ta
lent to catapult themselves to the heights of
the conference, though, can only be disco
vered over the next two seasons as this year's
freshmen and sophomores become seasoned
in the Pac-8.
But as for this season, Dißiaso predicted
what would happen when, before the season
began, he said, "If we can stay healthy, we
have a good chance of improving our record
considerably."
A few miles of adhesive tape later, the
Cards' record had improved by two games.

But there was hardly any way to talk the
way around four consecutive losses to the
Oregon schools.
There were no excuses the massacre at
McArthur Court. The Cards had been close at
half, but had fallen to a Duck team which
played incredibly intense basketball.
At Corvallis, the Cards were close until the
final few minutes. After the game, Dißiaso
had said. "I'm pleased with the way we
played tonight, except for a tew turnovers."
Inexperience can be a big reason tor los
ing, and this Dißiaso reiterated throughout
the year. "We're a young team.'' he said,
"and young teams are gonna make mis
takes." ((
"It seemed," said Bratz, "that at one point
during the game we lost our composure and
got beat."
Psychological reasons
Young teams can also be adversely af
fected psychologically if things go wrong.
I .osing can become a habit, the taste of defeat
less bitter with each ensuing setback.
Dißiaso said that his team didn't become
more passive in the midst of the losing
streak. "In general, the team maintained a
good attitude the whole season," said Di-
Biaso.
However, Dißiaso added, "This year we
had come to expect more and more of us."
And with the losses mounting, "We became
more irritable. We were by no means happy.
Losing became harder and harder to swal
low."
That was shown when the Cards hosted
Oregon State. When the officials failed to
call what he considered to be a five-second
violation by the Beavers in the last seconds
on a one-point loss, in anger Dißiaso nearly
jumped as high as the players had during the
game.
Second Oregon loss
A determined Cardinal effort against the
Ducks two days later offered little solace to
Dißiaso. "We executed better this time," he
said. "But the results weren't any different.
We lost. It seems that when we get within a
couple of points, we make a mistake."
Again, the "inconsistencies of youth,"
magnified by the injury situation. Before the
season, Dißiaso had said, "Wedon't havethe
depth to sustain ourselves over a long period
if injuries occur."
Jay Carter went up for a rebound
against Washington State in Stanford's
Pacific-8 opener at Pullman.
Stanford had a 7-3 record prior to its
conference tip-off. Despite the pre
season loss of the team's returning top
scorer, forward George Schader, to a
freak knee injury, the Cards had shown
over their first ten games that the
necessary adjustments had been made
and prospects for a fruitful conference
crusade looked good.
Two months later at Berkeley, Cal
forward Ray Murry flew in on a drive
and slammed the ball through the
hoop while being fouled by Kimberly
Belton. The Bear fans went bananas.
Murry's free throw made it Cal 99,
Stanford 89.
3-11 Pac-8
Seventeen seconds later the Cards
finished their conference season with
an 3-11 mark, 11-16 overall. Since the
6-foot-4 Carter had gone up for that
rebound, and strained the arch in his
foot when he had come back down,
Stanford had won only four of 17 bas
ketball games.
Why? Did Stanford have an easy
non-conference slate? Were there too
many injuries? Were there uninspired
performances? Why the big turn

"It's obvious that the loss of Jay Car
ter and injuries to key people kept us

said Card coach DickDißiaso. Because
of the line-up reshuffling necessitated

by injuries, "We couldn't develop one

With a healthy Carter, the Cards had

Fleeting win
But the relief supplied by the Washington
triumph was fleeting, for over the next three
games the Cards' performances were marred
by a lack of intensity on defense or a lack of
execution on offense.
And whereas in the earlier losses the in
jury situation or the superior play of the
other team had been given as the reason for
the outcome, in the losses to Washington
State at Maples Pavilion and to UCLA and
USC, Dißiaso blamed the lack of perfor

mance by the Cards as a primary cause for the
wide margins of defeat.
A season that looked to be very long back
in the January had by the end of February
turned into unending frustrations.
A season-ending split with Cal, though,
soothed some of pains of the Los Angeles
experiences. After the Cal game on
Saturday, Dißiaso said; "Kimberly Belton in
the last four games of the season showed the
potential he has to be an outstanding Pac-8
player."
Belton called the season a "learning ex
perience."
The other youngster on the team, Tom
Schmalzried, Dißiaso said, "played well, or
gained valuable experience." Dißiaso went
on to say that Schmalzried started to be effec
tive in "things that don't show up statisti
cally."
The improved play of the freshmen,
though, was overshadowed by the consistent
performance throughout the year by the
Cards' backcourt. Perry and Bratz, as Dißiaso
said, "are as good a combination as you
could find in the conference." It's no coinci
dence that the backcourt was most experi
enced part of the team.
Of course, the team's overall record this
season did improve over last year's. But then
again, last year, the Cards lost 11 games by
six points or less. This year, they lost only
one game by six points or less. They won five
games by six points or less.
No depth
This season, the Cards clearly did not have
the depth or the developed talent, especially
in the front court, to hold their own against
the tough competition in the Pac-8, "the
strongest conference in the country," ac
cording to Dißiaso.
Whether the Cards have the untapped ta
lent to catapult themselves to the heights of
the conference, though, can only be disco
vered over the next two seasons as this year's
freshmen and sophomores become seasoned
in the Pac-8.
But as for this season, Dißiaso predicted
what would happen when, before the season
began, he said, "If we can stay healthy, we
have a good chance of improving our record
considerably."
A few miles of adhesive tape later, the
Cards' record had improved by two games.

But there was hardly any way to talk the
way around four consecutive losses to the
Oregon schools.
There were no excuses the massacre at
McArthur Court. The Cards had been close at
half, but had fallen to a Duck team which
played incredibly intense basketball.
At Corvallis, the Cards were close until the
final few minutes. After the game, Dißiaso
had said. "I'm pleased with the way we
played tonight, except for a tew turnovers."
Inexperience can be a big reason tor los
ing, and this Dißiaso reiterated throughout
the year. "We're a young team.'' he said,
"and young teams are gonna make mis
takes." ((
"It seemed," said Bratz, "that at one point
during the game we lost our composure and
got beat."
Psychological reasons
Young teams can also be adversely af
fected psychologically if things go wrong.
I .osing can become a habit, the taste of defeat
less bitter with each ensuing setback.
Dißiaso said that his team didn't become
more passive in the midst of the losing
streak. "In general, the team maintained a
good attitude the whole season," said Di-
Biaso.
However, Dißiaso added, "This year we
had come to expect more and more of us."
And with the losses mounting, "We became
more irritable. We were by no means happy.
Losing became harder and harder to swal
low."
That was shown when the Cards hosted
Oregon State. When the officials failed to
call what he considered to be a five-second
violation by the Beavers in the last seconds
on a one-point loss, in anger Dißiaso nearly
jumped as high as the players had during the
game.
Second Oregon loss
A determined Cardinal effort against the
Ducks two days later offered little solace to
Dißiaso. "We executed better this time," he
said. "But the results weren't any different.
We lost. It seems that when we get within a
couple of points, we make a mistake."
Again, the "inconsistencies of youth,"
magnified by the injury situation. Before the
season, Dißiaso had said, "Wedon't havethe
depth to sustain ourselves over a long period
if injuries occur."
Jay Carter went up for a rebound
against Washington State in Stanford's
Pacific-8 opener at Pullman.
Stanford had a 7-3 record prior to its
conference tip-off. Despite the pre
season loss of the team's returning top
scorer, forward George Schader, to a
freak knee injury, the Cards had shown
over their first ten games that the
necessary adjustments had been made
and prospects for a fruitful conference
crusade looked good.
Two months later at Berkeley, Cal
forward Ray Murry flew in on a drive
and slammed the ball through the
hoop while being fouled by Kimberly
Belton. The Bear fans went bananas.
Murry's free throw made it Cal 99,
Stanford 89.
3-11 Pac-8
Seventeen seconds later the Cards
finished their conference season with
an 3-11 mark, 11-16 overall. Since the
6-foot-4 Carter had gone up for that
rebound, and strained the arch in his
foot when he had come back down,
Stanford had won only four of 17 bas
ketball games.
Why? Did Stanford have an easy
non-conference slate? Were there too
many injuries? Were there uninspired
performances? Why the big turn
around — for the worst? ,
"It's obvious that the loss of Jay Car
ter and injuries to key people kept us
from playing to our full potential,"
said Card coach DickDißiaso. Because
of the line-up reshuffling necessitated

by injuries, "We couldn't develop one
style of play," added Dißiaso.
With a healthy Carter, the Cards had
ccme from way behind to defeat
Nevada-Reno, 88-83, dropped Wis
consin, 70-66, and enjoyed a very suc
cessful Christmas junket. The season
opening embarrassing loss to Cal Poly
had been forgotten.
Non-conference
Had the opposition of the non
conference line-up been sufficient to
prepare Stanford for the Pac-8 season?

Season analysis

Dißiaso said, "The Pacific-8 is much
better." But, he added, "We thought it
(the non-conference schedule) pre
pared us for what we wanted it to."
Without Carter and his 10 point per
game average, the Cards lost in the last
few minutes to Washington State,
80-68 — a portent of things to come.
And then Stanford was blown out by
Washington.
"Carter's loss showed our lack of
depth, our depth and inexperience,"
said Dißiaso.
The Cards' youth showed through
their entire line-up, except for one
spot. That was the guard slot occupied
by senior Mike Bratz. But even in
Bratz' case, it was only his second year
in Dißiaso's system.
Post position
Jeff McHugh, who is only 6-BV2,
played the post position for most of the

season. He had seen little action in a
reserve role the year before.
For Wolfe Perry, the other healthy
returner who started, it was only his
first full year in the beginning five.
Inexperience was especially evident
with McHugh's frontcourt mates. Two
freshmen, 6-6V2 Kimberly Belton and
6-lOV2 Tom Schmalzried, carried the
bulk of the frontcourt play. Belton's
lack of an outside shot and Schmal
zried's tendency to get into foul trou
ble hampered the freshmen's effec-

tiveness.
Mark Fitzner, another forward,
could be counted on to come in some
times and supply some outside shoot
ing, but his board play was limited by
his size (6-7V 2 , 210).
'Defensive quickness'
Those two games in the Northwest
pointed out two things which the ab
sence of Carter precipitated. One qual
ity missing was, as Dißiaso said, "de
fensive quickness" in the front court.
The Cards were without anyone who
could keep up with the likes of Greg
Ballard, Marques Johnson and Don
Smith.
The other was that "We had to adopt
another personality," said Dißiaso.
"We had just started to believe in our
selves. Early, when we had the time,
we went with the four-corner offense
with Jay as guard."

Without a consistently effective
four-corner offense, the Cards had
trouble "getting the game down to the
last six minutes. We weren't able to
control the tempo. It became difficult
to maintain control of the game," said
DiBiaso.
Bratz, the Pac-8's fourth leading
scorer, agreed. "I don't want to make
excuses," he said, but with Carter out,
"We were definitely a changed team."
Home opener
The ingredients were present, then,
for a disastrous season. But the Pac-8
home opener against USC, which saw
a Card comeback late in the game to
pull out a 68-74 win, temporarily hid
the latent shortcomings of the squad.
A superb first-half performance
against UCLA two nights later and a
lackluster win against Hawaii a few
days later still offered hope for a win
ning campaign.
Stanford's capabilities for absorbing
adversity had been stretched to the
limit, however, by the injury to Carter,
the club's second-leading re
bounder. If anything else went wrong,
the Cards could snap like a too tightly
stretched rubber band.
Air Force loss
And that's exactly what happened
when Stanford traveled to the Rockies
for games against Air Force and Utah
State. Perry sprained his ankle in prac
tice on Tuesday, McHugh sprained his
ankle Wednesday in practice, and
Thursday, Air Force, a team with a
4-1 1 record, knocked off the Cards. 69-62.
"Air Force was probably the most disap
pointing loss of the season," said Dißiaso.
Against Utah State, the Cards were unable to
stay in the game and were run out of Logan,
103-84.
Up until these two losses, "We had over
come adversity and talked our way around
it," said Dißiaso.
It is certainly not a sign of strength if the
absence of one player, particularly a non
center, can make such a large difference in
the performance of a team. But with a lack of
depth to begin with, the injuries, especially
Carter's, inflamed an already dangerous
situation and make the performance of each
starter even more vital. "One player would
have a poor night and we were in trouble,"
said Dißiaso.
For instance, though Bratz played out
standing ball for most of the year, his points
were sorely missed during the two Oregon
contests in which he was effectively shut
down.
Dißiaso tried everything. He used man
to-man defense, a one-three-one zone with
Belton on the point to enable him to crash the
boards, strategic substituting to get a good
shooter in when the Cards went on offense,
and even going with a three-guard line-up
against teams with small forwards like
Washington and Oregon State.
Stanford's victory against Washington
supplied some very much needed relief in
the Cardinal locker room. With the triumph,
Stanford surpassed its victory output of the
previous season.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Di-
Biaso. "I never thought we'd budge from
nine."
Fleeting win
But the relief supplied by the Washington
triumph was fleeting, for over the next three
games the Cards' performances were marred
by a lack of intensity on defense or a lack of
execution on offense.
And whereas in the earlier losses the in
jury situation or the superior play of the
other team had been given as the reason for
the outcome, in the losses to Washington
State at Maples Pavilion and to UCLA and
USC, Dißiaso blamed the lack of perfor

mance by the Cards as a primary cause for the
wide margins of defeat.
A season that looked to be very long back
in the January had by the end of February
turned into unending frustrations.
A season-ending split with Cal, though,
soothed some of pains of the Los Angeles
experiences. After the Cal game on
Saturday, Dißiaso said; "Kimberly Belton in

"Carter's loss showed our lack of
depth, our depth and inexperience,"
said Dißiaso.
The Cards' youth showed through
their entire line-up, except for one
spot. That was the guard slot occupied
by senior Mike Bratz. But even in
Bratz' case, it was only his second year
in Dißiaso's system.
Post position
Jeff McHugh, who is only 6-BV2,
played the post position for most of the

season. He had seen little action in a
reserve role the year before.
For Wolfe Perry, the other healthy
returner who started, it was only his
first full year in the beginning five.
Inexperience was especially evident
with McHugh's frontcourt mates. Two
freshmen, 6-6V2 Kimberly Belton and
6-lOV2 Tom Schmalzried, carried the
bulk of the frontcourt play. Belton's
lack of an outside shot and Schmal
zried's tendency to get into foul trou
ble hampered the freshmen's effec-

tiveness.
Mark Fitzner, another forward,
could be counted on to come in some
times and supply some outside shoot
ing, but his board play was limited by
his size (6-7V 2 , 210).
'Defensive quickness'
Those two games in the Northwest
pointed out two things which the ab
sence of Carter precipitated. One qual
ity missing was, as Dißiaso said, "de
fensive quickness" in the front court.
The Cards were without anyone who
could keep up with the likes of Greg
Ballard, Marques Johnson and Don
Smith.
The other was that "We had to adopt
another personality," said Dißiaso.
"We had just started to believe in our
selves. Early, when we had the time,
we went with the four-corner offense
with Jay as guard."

Without a consistently effective
four-corner offense, the Cards had
trouble "getting the game down to the
last six minutes. We weren't able to
control the tempo. It became difficult
to maintain control of the game," said
DiBiaso.
Bratz, the Pac-8's fourth leading
scorer, agreed. "I don't want to make
excuses," he said, but with Carter out,
"We were definitely a changed team."
Home opener
The ingredients were present, then,
for a disastrous season. But the Pac-8
home opener against USC, which saw
a Card comeback late in the game to
pull out a 68-74 win, temporarily hid
the latent shortcomings of the squad.
A superb first-half performance
against UCLA two nights later and a
lackluster win against Hawaii a few
days later still offered hope for a win
ning campaign.
Stanford's capabilities for absorbing
adversity had been stretched to the
limit, however, by the injury to Carter,
the club's second-leading re
bounder. If anything else went wrong,
the Cards could snap like a too tightly
stretched rubber band.
Air Force loss
And that's exactly what happened
when Stanford traveled to the Rockies
for games against Air Force and Utah
State. Perry sprained his ankle in prac
tice on Tuesday, McHugh sprained his
ankle Wednesday in practice, and
Thursday, Air Force, a team with a
4-1 1 record, knocked off the Cards. 69-62.
"Air Force was probably the most disap
pointing loss of the season," said Dißiaso.
Against Utah State, the Cards were unable to
stay in the game and were run out of Logan,
103-84.
Up until these two losses, "We had over
come adversity and talked our way around
it," said Dißiaso.
It is certainly not a sign of strength if the
absence of one player, particularly a non
center, can make such a large difference in
the performance of a team. But with a lack of
depth to begin with, the injuries, especially
Carter's, inflamed an already dangerous
situation and make the performance of each
starter even more vital. "One player would
have a poor night and we were in trouble,"
said Dißiaso.
For instance, though Bratz played out
standing ball for most of the year, his points
were sorely missed during the two Oregon
contests in which he was effectively shut
down.
Dißiaso tried everything. He used man
to-man defense, a one-three-one zone with
Belton on the point to enable him to crash the
boards, strategic substituting to get a good
shooter in when the Cards went on offense,
and even going with a three-guard line-up
against teams with small forwards like
Washington and Oregon State.
Stanford's victory against Washington
supplied some very much needed relief in
the Cardinal locker room. With the triumph,
Stanford surpassed its victory output of the
previous season.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Di-
Biaso. "I never thought we'd budge from
nine."
Fleeting win
But the relief supplied by the Washington
triumph was fleeting, for over the next three
games the Cards' performances were marred
by a lack of intensity on defense or a lack of
execution on offense.
And whereas in the earlier losses the in
jury situation or the superior play of the
other team had been given as the reason for
the outcome, in the losses to Washington
State at Maples Pavilion and to UCLA and
USC, Dißiaso blamed the lack of perfor

mance by the Cards as a primary cause for the
wide margins of defeat.
A season that looked to be very long back
in the January had by the end of February
turned into unending frustrations.
A season-ending split with Cal, though,
soothed some of pains of the Los Angeles
experiences. After the Cal game on
Saturday, Dißiaso said; "Kimberly Belton in
the last four games of the season showed the
potential he has to be an outstanding Pac-8
player."
Belton called the season a "learning ex
perience."
The other youngster on the team, Tom
Schmalzried, Dißiaso said, "played well, or
gained valuable experience." Dißiaso went
on to say that Schmalzried started to be effec
tive in "things that don't show up statisti
cally."
The improved play of the freshmen,
though, was overshadowed by the consistent
performance throughout the year by the
Cards' backcourt. Perry and Bratz, as Dißiaso
said, "are as good a combination as you
could find in the conference." It's no coinci
dence that the backcourt was most experi
enced part of the team.
Of course, the team's overall record this
season did improve over last year's. But then
again, last year, the Cards lost 11 games by
six points or less. This year, they lost only
one game by six points or less. They won five
games by six points or less.
No depth
This season, the Cards clearly did not have
the depth or the developed talent, especially
in the front court, to hold their own against
the tough competition in the Pac-8, "the
strongest conference in the country," ac
cording to Dißiaso.
Whether the Cards have the untapped ta
lent to catapult themselves to the heights of
the conference, though, can only be disco
vered over the next two seasons as this year's
freshmen and sophomores become seasoned
in the Pac-8.
But as for this season, Dißiaso predicted
what would happen when, before the season
began, he said, "If we can stay healthy, we
have a good chance of improving our record
considerably."
A few miles of adhesive tape later, the
Cards' record had improved by two games.

But there was hardly any way to talk the
way around four consecutive losses to the
Oregon schools.
There were no excuses the massacre at
McArthur Court. The Cards had been close at
half, but had fallen to a Duck team which
played incredibly intense basketball.
At Corvallis, the Cards were close until the
final few minutes. After the game, Dißiaso
had said. "I'm pleased with the way we
played tonight, except for a tew turnovers."
Inexperience can be a big reason tor los
ing, and this Dißiaso reiterated throughout
the year. "We're a young team.'' he said,
"and young teams are gonna make mis
takes." ((
"It seemed," said Bratz, "that at one point
during the game we lost our composure and
got beat."
Psychological reasons
Young teams can also be adversely af
fected psychologically if things go wrong.
I .osing can become a habit, the taste of defeat
less bitter with each ensuing setback.
Dißiaso said that his team didn't become
more passive in the midst of the losing
streak. "In general, the team maintained a
good attitude the whole season," said Di-
Biaso.
However, Dißiaso added, "This year we
had come to expect more and more of us."
And with the losses mounting, "We became
more irritable. We were by no means happy.
Losing became harder and harder to swal
low."
That was shown when the Cards hosted
Oregon State. When the officials failed to
call what he considered to be a five-second
violation by the Beavers in the last seconds
on a one-point loss, in anger Dißiaso nearly
jumped as high as the players had during the
game.
Second Oregon loss
A determined Cardinal effort against the
Ducks two days later offered little solace to
Dißiaso. "We executed better this time," he
said. "But the results weren't any different.
We lost. It seems that when we get within a
couple of points, we make a mistake."
Again, the "inconsistencies of youth,"
magnified by the injury situation. Before the
season, Dißiaso had said, "Wedon't havethe
depth to sustain ourselves over a long period
if injuries occur."
Jay Carter went up for a rebound
against Washington State in Stanford's
Pacific-8 opener at Pullman.
Stanford had a 7-3 record prior to its
conference tip-off. Despite the pre
season loss of the team's returning top
scorer, forward George Schader, to a
freak knee injury, the Cards had shown
over their first ten games that the
necessary adjustments had been made
and prospects for a fruitful conference
crusade looked good.
Two months later at Berkeley, Cal
forward Ray Murry flew in on a drive
and slammed the ball through the
hoop while being fouled by Kimberly
Belton. The Bear fans went bananas.
Murry's free throw made it Cal 99,
Stanford 89.
3-11 Pac-8
Seventeen seconds later the Cards
finished their conference season with
an 3-11 mark, 11-16 overall. Since the
6-foot-4 Carter had gone up for that
rebound, and strained the arch in his
foot when he had come back down,
Stanford had won only four of 17 bas
ketball games.
Why? Did Stanford have an easy
non-conference slate? Were there too
many injuries? Were there uninspired
performances? Why the big turn
around — for the worst? ,
"It's obvious that the loss of Jay Car
ter and injuries to key people kept us
from playing to our full potential,"
said Card coach DickDißiaso. Because
of the line-up reshuffling necessitated

by injuries, "We couldn't develop one
style of play," added Dißiaso.
With a healthy Carter, the Cards had
ccme from way behind to defeat
Nevada-Reno, 88-83, dropped Wis
consin, 70-66, and enjoyed a very suc
cessful Christmas junket. The season
opening embarrassing loss to Cal Poly
had been forgotten.
Non-conference
Had the opposition of the non
conference line-up been sufficient to
prepare Stanford for the Pac-8 season?

Season analysis

Dißiaso said, "The Pacific-8 is much
better." But, he added, "We thought it
(the non-conference schedule) pre
pared us for what we wanted it to."
Without Carter and his 10 point per
game average, the Cards lost in the last
few minutes to Washington State,
80-68 — a portent of things to come.
And then Stanford was blown out by
Washington.
"Carter's loss showed our lack of
depth, our depth and inexperience,"
said Dißiaso.
The Cards' youth showed through
their entire line-up, except for one
spot. That was the guard slot occupied
by senior Mike Bratz. But even in
Bratz' case, it was only his second year

But as for this season, Dißiaso predicted
what would happen when, before the season
began, he said, "If we can stay healthy, we
have a good chance of improving our record
considerably."
A few miles of adhesive tape later, the
Cards' record had improved by two games.

But there was hardly any way to talk the
way around four consecutive losses to the
Oregon schools.
There were no excuses the massacre at
McArthur Court. The Cards had been close at
half, but had fallen to a Duck team which
played incredibly intense basketball.
At Corvallis, the Cards were close until the
final few minutes. After the game, Dißiaso
had said. "I'm pleased with the way we
played tonight, except for a tew turnovers."
Inexperience can be a big reason tor los
ing, and this Dißiaso reiterated throughout
the year. "We're a young team.'' he said,
"and young teams are gonna make mis
takes." ((
"It seemed," said Bratz, "that at one point
during the game we lost our composure and
got beat."
Psychological reasons
Young teams can also be adversely af
fected psychologically if things go wrong.
I .osing can become a habit, the taste of defeat
less bitter with each ensuing setback.
Dißiaso said that his team didn't become
more passive in the midst of the losing
streak. "In general, the team maintained a
good attitude the whole season," said Di-
Biaso.
However, Dißiaso added, "This year we
had come to expect more and more of us."
And with the losses mounting, "We became
more irritable. We were by no means happy.
Losing became harder and harder to swal
low."
That was shown when the Cards hosted
Oregon State. When the officials failed to
call what he considered to be a five-second
violation by the Beavers in the last seconds
on a one-point loss, in anger Dißiaso nearly
jumped as high as the players had during the
game.
Second Oregon loss
A determined Cardinal effort against the
Ducks two days later offered little solace to
Dißiaso. "We executed better this time," he
said. "But the results weren't any different.
We lost. It seems that when we get within a
couple of points, we make a mistake."
Again, the "inconsistencies of youth,"
magnified by the injury situation. Before the
season, Dißiaso had said, "Wedon't havethe
depth to sustain ourselves over a long period
if injuries occur."
Jay Carter went up for a rebound
against Washington State in Stanford's
Pacific-8 opener at Pullman.
Stanford had a 7-3 record prior to its
conference tip-off. Despite the pre
season loss of the team's returning top
scorer, forward George Schader, to a
freak knee injury, the Cards had shown
over their first ten games that the
necessary adjustments had been made
and prospects for a fruitful conference
crusade looked good.
Two months later at Berkeley, Cal
forward Ray Murry flew in on a drive
and slammed the ball through the
hoop while being fouled by Kimberly
Belton. The Bear fans went bananas.
Murry's free throw made it Cal 99,
Stanford 89.
3-11 Pac-8
Seventeen seconds later the Cards
finished their conference season with
an 3-11 mark, 11-16 overall. Since the
6-foot-4 Carter had gone up for that
rebound, and strained the arch in his
foot when he had come back down,
Stanford had won only four of 17 bas
ketball games.
Why? Did Stanford have an easy
non-conference slate? Were there too
many injuries? Were there uninspired
performances? Why the big turn
around — for the worst? ,
"It's obvious that the loss of Jay Car
ter and injuries to key people kept us
from playing to our full potential,"
said Card coach DickDißiaso. Because
of the line-up reshuffling necessitated

by injuries, "We couldn't develop one
style of play," added Dißiaso.
With a healthy Carter, the Cards had
ccme from way behind to defeat
Nevada-Reno, 88-83, dropped Wis
consin, 70-66, and enjoyed a very suc
cessful Christmas junket. The season
opening embarrassing loss to Cal Poly
had been forgotten.
Non-conference
Had the opposition of the non
conference line-up been sufficient to
prepare Stanford for the Pac-8 season?

Season analysis

Dißiaso said, "The Pacific-8 is much
better." But, he added, "We thought it
(the non-conference schedule) pre
pared us for what we wanted it to."
Without Carter and his 10 point per
game average, the Cards lost in the last
few minutes to Washington State,
80-68 — a portent of things to come.
And then Stanford was blown out by
Washington.
"Carter's loss showed our lack of
depth, our depth and inexperience,"
said Dißiaso.
The Cards' youth showed through
their entire line-up, except for one
spot. That was the guard slot occupied
by senior Mike Bratz. But even in
Bratz' case, it was only his second year
in Dißiaso's system.
Post position
Jeff McHugh, who is only 6-BV2,
played the post position for most of the

season. He had seen little action in a
reserve role the year before.
For Wolfe Perry, the other healthy
returner who started, it was only his
first full year in the beginning five.
Inexperience was especially evident
with McHugh's frontcourt mates. Two
freshmen, 6-6V2 Kimberly Belton and
6-lOV2 Tom Schmalzried, carried the
bulk of the frontcourt play. Belton's
lack of an outside shot and Schmal
zried's tendency to get into foul trou
ble hampered the freshmen's effec-

tiveness.
Mark Fitzner, another forward,
could be counted on to come in some
times and supply some outside shoot
ing, but his board play was limited by
his size (6-7V 2 , 210).
'Defensive quickness'
Those two games in the Northwest
pointed out two things which the ab
sence of Carter precipitated. One qual
ity missing was, as Dißiaso said, "de
fensive quickness" in the front court.
The Cards were without anyone who
could keep up with the likes of Greg
Ballard, Marques Johnson and Don
Smith.
The other was that "We had to adopt
another personality," said Dißiaso.
"We had just started to believe in our
selves. Early, when we had the time,
we went with the four-corner offense
with Jay as guard."

Without a consistently effective
four-corner offense, the Cards had
trouble "getting the game down to the
last six minutes. We weren't able to
control the tempo. It became difficult
to maintain control of the game," said
DiBiaso.
Bratz, the Pac-8's fourth leading
scorer, agreed. "I don't want to make
excuses," he said, but with Carter out,
"We were definitely a changed team."
Home opener
The ingredients were present, then,
for a disastrous season. But the Pac-8
home opener against USC, which saw
a Card comeback late in the game to
pull out a 68-74 win, temporarily hid
the latent shortcomings of the squad.
A superb first-half performance
against UCLA two nights later and a
lackluster win against Hawaii a few
days later still offered hope for a win
ning campaign.
Stanford's capabilities for absorbing
adversity had been stretched to the
limit, however, by the injury to Carter,
the club's second-leading re
bounder. If anything else went wrong,
the Cards could snap like a too tightly
stretched rubber band.
Air Force loss
And that's exactly what happened
when Stanford traveled to the Rockies
for games against Air Force and Utah
State. Perry sprained his ankle in prac
tice on Tuesday, McHugh sprained his
ankle Wednesday in practice, and
Thursday, Air Force, a team with a
4-1 1 record, knocked off the Cards. 69-62.
"Air Force was probably the most disap
pointing loss of the season," said Dißiaso.
Against Utah State, the Cards were unable to
stay in the game and were run out of Logan,
103-84.
Up until these two losses, "We had over
come adversity and talked our way around
it," said Dißiaso.
It is certainly not a sign of strength if the
absence of one player, particularly a non
center, can make such a large difference in
the performance of a team. But with a lack of
depth to begin with, the injuries, especially
Carter's, inflamed an already dangerous
situation and make the performance of each
starter even more vital. "One player would
have a poor night and we were in trouble,"
said Dißiaso.
For instance, though Bratz played out
standing ball for most of the year, his points
were sorely missed during the two Oregon
contests in which he was effectively shut
down.
Dißiaso tried everything. He used man
to-man defense, a one-three-one zone with
Belton on the point to enable him to crash the
boards, strategic substituting to get a good
shooter in when the Cards went on offense,
and even going with a three-guard line-up
against teams with small forwards like
Washington and Oregon State.
Stanford's victory against Washington
supplied some very much needed relief in
the Cardinal locker room. With the triumph,
Stanford surpassed its victory output of the
previous season.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Di-
Biaso. "I never thought we'd budge from
nine."
Fleeting win
But the relief supplied by the Washington
triumph was fleeting, for over the next three
games the Cards' performances were marred
by a lack of intensity on defense or a lack of
execution on offense.
And whereas in the earlier losses the in
jury situation or the superior play of the
other team had been given as the reason for
the outcome, in the losses to Washington
State at Maples Pavilion and to UCLA and
USC, Dißiaso blamed the lack of perfor

mance by the Cards as a primary cause for the
wide margins of defeat.
A season that looked to be very long back
in the January had by the end of February
turned into unending frustrations.
A season-ending split with Cal, though,
soothed some of pains of the Los Angeles
experiences. After the Cal game on
Saturday, Dißiaso said; "Kimberly Belton in
the last four games of the season showed the
potential he has to be an outstanding Pac-8
player."
Belton called the season a "learning ex
perience."
The other youngster on the team, Tom
Schmalzried, Dißiaso said, "played well, or
gained valuable experience." Dißiaso went
on to say that Schmalzried started to be effec
tive in "things that don't show up statisti
cally."
The improved play of the freshmen,
though, was overshadowed by the consistent
performance throughout the year by the
Cards' backcourt. Perry and Bratz, as Dißiaso
said, "are as good a combination as you
could find in the conference." It's no coinci
dence that the backcourt was most experi
enced part of the team.
Of course, the team's overall record this
season did improve over last year's. But then
again, last year, the Cards lost 11 games by
six points or less. This year, they lost only
one game by six points or less. They won five
games by six points or less.
No depth
This season, the Cards clearly did not have
the depth or the developed talent, especially
in the front court, to hold their own against
the tough competition in the Pac-8, "the
strongest conference in the country," ac
cording to Dißiaso.
Whether the Cards have the untapped ta
lent to catapult themselves to the heights of
the conference, though, can only be disco
vered over the next two seasons as this year's
freshmen and sophomores become seasoned
in the Pac-8.
But as for this season, Dißiaso predicted
what would happen when, before the season
began, he said, "If we can stay healthy, we
have a good chance of improving our record
considerably."
A few miles of adhesive tape later, the
Cards' record had improved by two games.

But there was hardly any way to talk the
way around four consecutive losses to the
Oregon schools.
There were no excuses the massacre at
McArthur Court. The Cards had been close at

played incredibly intense basketball.
At Corvallis, the Cards were close until the
final few minutes. After the game, Dißiaso

got beat."

fected psychologically if things go wrong.

less bitter with each ensuing setback.

Biaso.

a Card comeback late in the game to
pull out a 68-74 win, temporarily hid
the latent shortcomings of the squad.
A superb first-half performance
against UCLA two nights later and a
lackluster win against Hawaii a few
days later still offered hope for a win
ning campaign.
Stanford's capabilities for absorbing
adversity had been stretched to the
limit, however, by the injury to Carter,
the club's second-leading re
bounder. If anything else went wrong,
the Cards could snap like a too tightly
stretched rubber band.
Air Force loss
And that's exactly what happened
when Stanford traveled to the Rockies
for games against Air Force and Utah
State. Perry sprained his ankle in prac
tice on Tuesday, McHugh sprained his
ankle Wednesday in practice, and
Thursday, Air Force, a team with a
4-1 1 record, knocked off the Cards. 69-62.
"Air Force was probably the most disap
pointing loss of the season," said Dißiaso.
Against Utah State, the Cards were unable to
stay in the game and were run out of Logan,
103-84.
Up until these two losses, "We had over
come adversity and talked our way around
it," said Dißiaso.
It is certainly not a sign of strength if the
absence of one player, particularly a non
center, can make such a large difference in
the performance of a team. But with a lack of
depth to begin with, the injuries, especially
Carter's, inflamed an already dangerous
situation and make the performance of each
starter even more vital. "One player would
have a poor night and we were in trouble,"
said Dißiaso.
For instance, though Bratz played out
standing ball for most of the year, his points
were sorely missed during the two Oregon
contests in which he was effectively shut
down.
Dißiaso tried everything. He used man
to-man defense, a one-three-one zone with
Belton on the point to enable him to crash the
boards, strategic substituting to get a good
shooter in when the Cards went on offense,
and even going with a three-guard line-up
against teams with small forwards like
Washington and Oregon State.
Stanford's victory against Washington
supplied some very much needed relief in
the Cardinal locker room. With the triumph,
Stanford surpassed its victory output of the
previous season.
"Ten wins! It feels tremendous," said Di-
Biaso. "I never thought we'd budge from
nine."
Fleeting win
But the relief supplied by the Washington
triumph was fleeting, for over the next three
games the Cards' performances were marred
by a lack of intensity on defense or a lack of
execution on offense.
And whereas in the earlier losses the in
jury situation or the superior play of the
other team had been given as the reason for
the outcome, in the losses to Washington
State at Maples Pavilion and to UCLA and
USC, Dißiaso blamed the lack of perfor

mance by the Cards as a primary cause for the
wide margins of defeat.
A season that looked to be very long back
in the January had by the end of February
turned into unending frustrations.
A season-ending split with Cal, though,
soothed some of pains of the Los Angeles
experiences. After the Cal game on
Saturday, Dißiaso said; "Kimberly Belton in
the last four games of the season showed the
potential he has to be an outstanding Pac-8
player."
Belton called the season a "learning ex
perience."
The other youngster on the team, Tom
Schmalzried, Dißiaso said, "played well, or
gained valuable experience." Dißiaso went
on to say that Schmalzried started to be effec
tive in "things that don't show up statisti
cally."
The improved play of the freshmen,
though, was overshadowed by the consistent
performance throughout the year by the
Cards' backcourt. Perry and Bratz, as Dißiaso
said, "are as good a combination as you
could find in the conference." It's no coinci
dence that the backcourt was most experi
enced part of the team.
Of course, the team's overall record this
season did improve over last year's. But then
again, last year, the Cards lost 11 games by
six points or less. This year, they lost only
one game by six points or less. They won five
games by six points or less.
No depth
This season, the Cards clearly did not have
the depth or the developed talent, especially
in the front court, to hold their own against
the tough competition in the Pac-8, "the
strongest conference in the country," ac
cording to Dißiaso.
Whether the Cards have the untapped ta
lent to catapult themselves to the heights of
the conference, though, can only be disco
vered over the next two seasons as this year's
freshmen and sophomores become seasoned
in the Pac-8.
But as for this season, Dißiaso predicted
what would happen when, before the season
began, he said, "If we can stay healthy, we
have a good chance of improving our record
considerably."
A few miles of adhesive tape later, the
Cards' record had improved by two games.

But there was hardly any way to talk the
way around four consecutive losses to the
Oregon schools.
There were no excuses the massacre at
McArthur Court. The Cards had been close at
half, but had fallen to a Duck team which
played incredibly intense basketball.
At Corvallis, the Cards were close until the
final few minutes. After the game, Dißiaso
had said. "I'm pleased with the way we
played tonight, except for a tew turnovers."
Inexperience can be a big reason tor los
ing, and this Dißiaso reiterated throughout
the year. "We're a young team.'' he said,
"and young teams are gonna make mis
takes." ((
"It seemed," said Bratz, "that at one point
during the game we lost our composure and
got beat."
Psychological reasons
Young teams can also be adversely af
fected psychologically if things go wrong.
I .osing can become a habit, the taste of defeat
less bitter with each ensuing setback.
Dißiaso said that his team didn't become
more passive in the midst of the losing
streak. "In general, the team maintained a
good attitude the whole season," said Di-
Biaso.
However, Dißiaso added, "This year we
had come to expect more and more of us."
And with the losses mounting, "We became
more irritable. We were by no means happy.
Losing became harder and harder to swal
low."
That was shown when the Cards hosted
Oregon State. When the officials failed to
call what he considered to be a five-second
violation by the Beavers in the last seconds
on a one-point loss, in anger Dißiaso nearly
jumped as high as the players had during the
game.
Second Oregon loss
A determined Cardinal effort against the
Ducks two days later offered little solace to
Dißiaso. "We executed better this time," he
said. "But the results weren't any different.
We lost. It seems that when we get within a
couple of points, we make a mistake."
Again, the "inconsistencies of youth,"
magnified by the injury situation. Before the
season, Dißiaso had said, "Wedon't havethe
depth to sustain ourselves over a long period
if injuries occur."
Jay Carter went up for a rebound
against Washington State in Stanford's
Pacific-8 opener at Pullman.
Stanford had a 7-3 record prior to its
conference tip-off. Despite the pre
season loss of the team's returning top
scorer, forward George Schader, to a
freak knee injury, the Cards had shown
over their first ten games that the
necessary adjustments had been made
and prospects for a fruitful conference
crusade looked good.
Two months later at Berkeley, Cal
forward Ray Murry flew in on a drive
and slammed the ball through the
hoop while being fouled by Kimberly
Belton. The Bear fans went bananas.
Murry's free throw made it Cal 99,
Stanford 89.
3-11 Pac-8
Seventeen seconds later the Cards
finished their conference season with
an 3-11 mark, 11-16 overall. Since the
6-foot-4 Carter had gone up for that
rebound, and strained the arch in his
foot when he had come back down,
Stanford had won only four of 17 bas
ketball games.
Why? Did Stanford have an easy
non-conference slate? Were there too
many injuries? Were there uninspired
performances? Why the big turn
around — for the worst? ,
"It's obvious that the loss of Jay Car
ter and injuries to key people kept us
from playing to our full potential,"
said Card coach DickDißiaso. Because
of the line-up reshuffling necessitated

by injuries, "We couldn't develop one
style of play," added Dißiaso.
With a healthy Carter, the Cards had
ccme from way behind to defeat
Nevada-Reno, 88-83, dropped Wis
consin, 70-66, and enjoyed a very suc
cessful Christmas junket. The season
opening embarrassing loss to Cal Poly
had been forgotten.
Non-conference
Had the opposition of the non
conference line-up been sufficient to
prepare Stanford for the Pac-8 season?

Season analysis

Dißiaso said, "The Pacific-8 is much
better." But, he added, "We thought it
(the non-conference schedule) pre
pared us for what we wanted it to."
Without Carter and his 10 point per
game average, the Cards lost in the last
few minutes to Washington State,
80-68 — a portent of things to come.
And then Stanford was blown out by
Washington.
"Carter's loss showed our lack of
depth, our depth and inexperience,"
said Dißiaso.
The Cards' youth showed through
their entire line-up, except for one
spot. That was the guard slot occupied
by senior Mike Bratz. But even in
Bratz' case, it was only his second year
in Dißiaso's system.
Post position
Jeff McHugh, who is only 6-BV2,
played the post position for most of the

season. He had seen little action in a
reserve role the year before.
For Wolfe Perry, the other healthy
returner who started, it was only his
first full year in the beginning five.
Inexperience was especially evident
with McHugh's frontcourt mates. Two
freshmen, 6-6V2 Kimberly Belton and
6-lOV2 Tom Schmalzried, carried the
bulk of the frontcourt play. Belton's
lack of an outside shot and Schmal
zried's tendency to get into foul trou
ble hampered the freshmen's effec-

tiveness.
Mark Fitzner, another forward,
could be counted on to come in some
times and supply some outside shoot
ing, but his board play was limited by
his size (6-7V 2 , 210).
'Defensive quickness'
Those two games in the Northwest
pointed out two things which the ab
sence of Carter precipitated. One qual
ity missing was, as Dißiaso said, "de
fensive quickness" in the front court.
The Cards were without anyone who
could keep up with the likes of Greg
Ballard, Marques Johnson and Don
Smith.
The other was that "We had to adopt
another personality," said Dißiaso.
"We had just started to believe in our
selves. Early, when we had the time,
we went with the four-corner offense
with Jay as guard."

Without a consistently effective
four-corner offense, the Cards had
trouble "getting the game down to the
last six minutes. We weren't able to
control the tempo. It became difficult
to maintain control of the game," said
DiBiaso.
Bratz, the Pac-8's fourth leading
scorer, agreed. "I don't want to make
excuses," he said, but with Carter out,
"We were definitely a changed team."
Home opener
The ingredients were present, then,
for a disastrous season. But the Pac-8
home opener against USC, which saw
a Card comeback late in the game to
pull out a 68-74 win, temporarily hid
the latent shortcomings of the squad.
A superb first-half performance
against UCLA two nights later and a
lackluster win against Hawaii a few
days later still offered hope for a win
ning campaign.
Stanford's capabilities for absorbing
adversity had been stretched to the
limit, however, by the injury to Carter,
the club's second-leading re
bounder. If anything else went wrong,
the Cards could snap like a too tightly
stretched rubber band.
Air Force loss
And that's exactly what happened
when Stanford traveled to the Rockies
for games against Air Force and Utah
State. Perry sprained his ankle in prac
tice on Tuesday, McHugh sprained his
ankle Wednesday in practice, and
Thursday, Air Force, a team with a
4-1 1 record, knocked off the Cards. 69-62.
"Air Force was probably the most disap
pointing loss of the season," said Dißiaso.
Against Utah State, the Cards were unable to
stay in the game and were run out of Logan,
103-84.
