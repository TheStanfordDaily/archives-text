# Injuries hampered Stanford basketball season
## 
### David Georgette 
Jay Carter went up for a rebound
against Washington State in Stanford's
Pacific-8 opener at Pullman.
Stanford had a 7-3 record prior to its
conference tip-off. Despite the pre
season loss of the team's returning top
scorer, forward George Schader, to a
freak knee injury, the Cards had shown
over their first ten games that the
necessary adjustments had been made
and prospects for a fruitful conference
crusade looked good.
Two months later at Berkeley, Cal
forward Ray Murry flew in on a drive
and slammed the ball through the
hoop while being fouled by Kimberly
Belton. The Bear fans went bananas.
Murry's free throw made it Cal 99,
Stanford 89.
3-11 Pac-8
Seventeen seconds later the Cards
finished their conference season with
an 3-11 mark, 11-16 overall. Since the
6-foot-4 Carter had gone up for that
rebound, and strained the arch in his
foot when he had come back down,
Stanford had won only four of 17 bas
ketball games.
Why? Did Stanford have an easy
non-conference slate? Were there too
many injuries? Were there uninspired
performances? Why the big turn
around — for the worst? ,
"It's obvious that the loss of Jay Car
ter and injuries to key people kept us
from playing to our full potential,"
said Card coach DickDißiaso. Because
of the line-up reshuffling necessitated

by injuries, "We couldn't develop one
style of play," added Dißiaso.
With a healthy Carter, the Cards had
ccme from way behind to defeat
Nevada-Reno, 88-83, dropped Wis
consin, 70-66, and enjoyed a very suc
cessful Christmas junket. The season
opening embarrassing loss to Cal Poly
had been forgotten.
Non-conference
Had the opposition of the non
conference line-up been sufficient to
prepare Stanford for the Pac-8 season?

Season analysis

Dißiaso said, "The Pacific-8 is much
better." But, he added, "We thought it
(the non-conference schedule) pre
pared us for what we wanted it to."
Without Carter and his 10 point per
game average, the Cards lost in the last
few minutes to Washington State,
80-68 — a portent of things to come.
And then Stanford was blown out by
Washington.
"Carter's loss showed our lack of
depth, our depth and inexperience,"
said Dißiaso.
The Cards' youth showed through
their entire line-up, except for one
spot. That was the guard slot occupied
by senior Mike Bratz. But even in
Bratz' case, it was only his second year
in Dißiaso's system.
Post position
Jeff McHugh, who is only 6-BV2,
played the post position for most of the

season. He had seen little action in a
reserve role the year before.
For Wolfe Perry, the other healthy
returner who started, it was only his
first full year in the beginning five.
Inexperience was especially evident
with McHugh's frontcourt mates. Two
freshmen, 6-6V2 Kimberly Belton and
6-lOV2 Tom Schmalzried, carried the
bulk of the frontcourt play. Belton's
lack of an outside shot and Schmal
zried's tendency to get into foul trou
ble hampered the freshmen's effec-

tiveness.
Mark Fitzner, another forward,
could be counted on to come in some
times and supply some outside shoot
ing, but his board play was limited by
his size (6-7V 2 , 210).
'Defensive quickness'
Those two games in the Northwest
pointed out two things which the ab
sence of Carter precipitated. One qual
ity missing was, as Dißiaso said, "de
fensive quickness" in the front court.
The Cards were without anyone who
could keep up with the likes of Greg
Ballard, Marques Johnson and Don
Smith.
The other was that "We had to adopt
another personality," said Dißiaso.
"We had just started to believe in our
selves. Early, when we had the time,
we went with the four-corner offense
with Jay as guard."

Without a consistently effective
four-corner offense, the Cards had
trouble "getting the game down to the
last six minutes. We weren't able to
control the tempo. It became difficult
to maintain control of the game," said
DiBiaso.
Bratz, the Pac-8's fourth leading
scorer, agreed. "I don't want to make
excuses," he said, but with Carter out,
"We were definitely a changed team."
Home opener
The ingredients were present, then,
for a disastrous season. But the Pac-8
home opener against USC, which saw
a Card comeback late in the game to
pull out a 68-74 win, temporarily hid
the latent shortcomings of the squad.
A superb first-half performance
against UCLA two nights later and a
lackluster win against Hawaii a few
days later still offered hope for a win
ning campaign.
Stanford's capabilities for absorbing
adversity had been stretched to the
limit, however, by the injury to Carter,
the club's second-leading re
bounder. If anything else went wrong,
the Cards could snap like a too tightly
stretched rubber band.
Air Force loss
And that's exactly what happened
when Stanford traveled to the Rockies
for games against Air Force and Utah
State. Perry sprained his ankle in prac
tice on Tuesday, McHugh sprained his
ankle Wednesday in practice, and
Thursday, Air Force, a team with a
