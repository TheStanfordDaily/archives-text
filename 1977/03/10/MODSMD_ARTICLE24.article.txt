# Card men, women swimmers travel to national championships
## 
### 
"Everybody is looking so strong," said as
sistant coach Debbie Meyer. "I can see the
power in every stroke. I feel myself churning
in the water right along side them."
Stanford's men and women swimmers
travel to the Eastern U.S. for national com
petition over the spring break with both
teams hoping to finish among the top five.
The women fly to Brown University in
Providence. R.l. for the AIAW champion
ships Thurs.-Sat. March 17-19 whilethe men
compete in the NCAA championships
Thurs.-Sat. March 24-26.
"The women have an outsider's chance at
winning it all," said head coach Jim Gaug
hran. "We will need a lot of high place
finishes. We have 11 women competing
while the top schools (Arizona State and
UCLA) have 18.
"We've got a lot of versatility, though and
so we have a good chance of finishing high if
all of our girls get into the finals."
For the men's team it's a different story. Up
against tough UCLA, USC, Cal, Alabama and
Indiana, the Cards stand no chance of walk
ing away with the NCAA crown. Yet the men
should clock some lifetime best times which
will bring a fantastic climax to their long
hard training.
"We don't have a lot of guys in different

events," Gaughran said. "Bruner and Shil
ling are the only two who will compete in
three individual events."
Predicted by Swimming World magazine
to be the tenth team in the nation this season,
Gaughran said that he's sure the swimmers
will prove the prediction false.
"After last weekend's swims at Pac-Bs," he
said, "I am confident that we will finish fifth
or sixth."
Last season the Cards were tenth.

winning it all," said head coach Jim Gaug
hran. "We will need a lot of high place
finishes. We have 11 women competing
while the top schools (Arizona State and
UCLA) have 18.
"We've got a lot of versatility, though and
so we have a good chance of finishing high if
all of our girls get into the finals."
For the men's team it's a different story. Up
against tough UCLA, USC, Cal, Alabama and
Indiana, the Cards stand no chance of walk
ing away with the NCAA crown. Yet the men
should clock some lifetime best times which
will bring a fantastic climax to their long
hard training.
"We don't have a lot of guys in different

events," Gaughran said. "Bruner and Shil
ling are the only two who will compete in
three individual events."
Predicted by Swimming World magazine
to be the tenth team in the nation this season,
Gaughran said that he's sure the swimmers
will prove the prediction false.
"After last weekend's swims at Pac-Bs," he
said, "I am confident that we will finish fifth
or sixth."
Last season the Cards were tenth.
