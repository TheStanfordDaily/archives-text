"What kind of girl actually finds football
players interesting?"
"How can you carry on conversations that last
longer than five minutes with those dumb
jocks?"
"Well, the press box is getting nicer looking
fixtures everyday."
Such are some of the statements 1 have heard
since I first started breaking into the all male
dominion of sports writing a year ago.
Often times reporting is frustrating, agoniz
ing, tiring and painful.
Old male die-hard fans and writers find it re
pulsive that a female dares to step foot near a
baseball diamond, football field or locker room.
Yet as I learn to laugh off the criticism, roll
with the punches and keep from feeling the need
to prove myself to the male populace, sportswrit
ing becomes easier, a lot more fun and brings
rewarding friendships.
Women sports writers stil 1 face more obstacles
than a hurdler. Nowadays sports writing focuses
less on the play-by-play and more on the
thoughts, problems and personal lives of
athletes. Women can be at a disadvantage af
getting close to their sources. There is too much
misunderstanding — too much innuendo if you
try.
—Johnny Bench sure thought so. Our phone
conversation last spring went like this:
Me: "I'd like to get together with you while
you're in town to . . . "
Bench: "My schedule is pretty tight, but ..."
Me: "It will only take a few minutes."
Bench: "Oh, well, how aboutafter the game —
or, babe, let's have breakfast tomorrow at the
hotel."
—One big Stanford defensive player put me
on the defensive during an interview last fall. As
we watched "Monday Night Football" he "mel
lowed out" a little too much.
"I'm serious," 1 said.
"Me too," was the reply.
—In a room where the athletes met writers
after the East-West Shrine game last Jan. 2. I
chatted with a quarterback from my home state
of Wisconsin. As one West squad member
walked in the room, he smiled at me and came
over and pinched me.
—Last month when I introduced myself to
football coach Bill Walsh he said he hadn't ex
pected a woman football writer. Then when I set
up an appointment for our interview the follow
ing morning at 9a.m., lie said kiddingly, "Let me
write down your title because my wife will never
believe me."
—Late one Thursday night during the basket
ball season, the Daily got a phone call.
"Sports, you've got a call," a news writer yel
led.
Since I was the only one around who knew the
. difference between a free throw and a field goal.

I took (he call.
"May 1 help you?"
"1 want sports. Where's Chris Baker?" the
man's voice said a little anncfyed.
"He isn't here. But 1 am a sports editor. 1
KNOW SPORTS. I can help you," 1 said harshly.
"Who is this?"
"Jill Lieber," 1 said looking at the clock spell
out 1:30 a.m. The call was obviously one of those
the Daily gets from fans who want to know some
obscure fact like when the national tiddly winks
tournament will be held.
"Oh, hi Jill," he said as if he knew me.
This guy was too much. Maybe even a little too
friendly for this late hour.
"Would you like some help?" 1 was quickly
losing my temper.
"This is Bob Frederick (assistant basketball
coach)."
There I was in my usual position — with my
foot in my mouth.
—In November I flew with the football team to
Eugene for the Oregon-Stanford game. 1 was
mistaken by some of the freshmen players as a
coach's daughter. I got strange looks from the
Oregon ians who saw 40 huge guys and me roam
ing around the lobby of the motel.
But perhaps the funniest look was that on
UCLA quarterback Jeff Dankworth's face.
UCLA was also staying in Eugene that night
because they were playing Oregon State the next
afternoon and Corvallis has very little in the
ways of motels or restaurants. 1 had dinner with
two writers from the UCLA Daily Bruin and we
went back and watched T.V. in their room. Two
players next door were wrestling and throwing
each other against the walls. Most of the others
were telling jokes along with coach Terry
Donahue downstairs in front of the lobby's firep
lace.
My friend turned to me, "Ready to meet
Dankworth?" Ever since the Arizona State game
at the end of the summer I had wanted to inter
view Dankworth especially to see how he hand
led all the publicity from Sports Illustrated and
national T.V.
They called his room.
"Jeff, there's a sports editor herefrom Stanford
who didn't get a chance to talk to you when
Stanford was down in L A. Can we come down
now?"
We all walked down to his room.
"Cod, 1 hope he doesn't think you're a guy and
come to the door in his shorts," one friend said
on the way. "We should've told him your
name."
Dankworth opened the door, his pants half
way on and no shirt.
"Ah, nice to meet you?" he said.
He shook his head and laughed.
"I should have known."

jocks?"
"Well, the press box is getting nicer looking
fixtures everyday."
Such are some of the statements 1 have heard
since I first started breaking into the all male
dominion of sports writing a year ago.
Often times reporting is frustrating, agoniz
ing, tiring and painful.
Old male die-hard fans and writers find it re
pulsive that a female dares to step foot near a
baseball diamond, football field or locker room.
Yet as I learn to laugh off the criticism, roll
with the punches and keep from feeling the need
to prove myself to the male populace, sportswrit
ing becomes easier, a lot more fun and brings
rewarding friendships.
Women sports writers stil 1 face more obstacles
than a hurdler. Nowadays sports writing focuses
less on the play-by-play and more on the
thoughts, problems and personal lives of
athletes. Women can be at a disadvantage af
getting close to their sources. There is too much
misunderstanding — too much innuendo if you
try.
—Johnny Bench sure thought so. Our phone
conversation last spring went like this:
Me: "I'd like to get together with you while
you're in town to . . . "
Bench: "My schedule is pretty tight, but ..."
Me: "It will only take a few minutes."
Bench: "Oh, well, how aboutafter the game —
or, babe, let's have breakfast tomorrow at the
hotel."
—One big Stanford defensive player put me
on the defensive during an interview last fall. As
we watched "Monday Night Football" he "mel
lowed out" a little too much.
"I'm serious," 1 said.
"Me too," was the reply.
—In a room where the athletes met writers
after the East-West Shrine game last Jan. 2. I
chatted with a quarterback from my home state
of Wisconsin. As one West squad member
walked in the room, he smiled at me and came
over and pinched me.
—Last month when I introduced myself to
football coach Bill Walsh he said he hadn't ex
pected a woman football writer. Then when I set
up an appointment for our interview the follow
ing morning at 9a.m., lie said kiddingly, "Let me
write down your title because my wife will never
believe me."
—Late one Thursday night during the basket
ball season, the Daily got a phone call.
"Sports, you've got a call," a news writer yel
led.
Since I was the only one around who knew the
. difference between a free throw and a field goal.

I took (he call.
"May 1 help you?"
"1 want sports. Where's Chris Baker?" the
man's voice said a little anncfyed.
"He isn't here. But 1 am a sports editor. 1
KNOW SPORTS. I can help you," 1 said harshly.
"Who is this?"
"Jill Lieber," 1 said looking at the clock spell
out 1:30 a.m. The call was obviously one of those
the Daily gets from fans who want to know some
obscure fact like when the national tiddly winks
tournament will be held.
"Oh, hi Jill," he said as if he knew me.
This guy was too much. Maybe even a little too
friendly for this late hour.
"Would you like some help?" 1 was quickly
losing my temper.
"This is Bob Frederick (assistant basketball
coach)."
There I was in my usual position — with my
foot in my mouth.
—In November I flew with the football team to
Eugene for the Oregon-Stanford game. 1 was
mistaken by some of the freshmen players as a
coach's daughter. I got strange looks from the
Oregon ians who saw 40 huge guys and me roam
ing around the lobby of the motel.
But perhaps the funniest look was that on
UCLA quarterback Jeff Dankworth's face.
UCLA was also staying in Eugene that night
because they were playing Oregon State the next
afternoon and Corvallis has very little in the
ways of motels or restaurants. 1 had dinner with
two writers from the UCLA Daily Bruin and we
went back and watched T.V. in their room. Two
players next door were wrestling and throwing
each other against the walls. Most of the others
were telling jokes along with coach Terry
Donahue downstairs in front of the lobby's firep
lace.
My friend turned to me, "Ready to meet
Dankworth?" Ever since the Arizona State game
at the end of the summer I had wanted to inter
view Dankworth especially to see how he hand
led all the publicity from Sports Illustrated and
national T.V.
They called his room.
"Jeff, there's a sports editor herefrom Stanford
who didn't get a chance to talk to you when
Stanford was down in L A. Can we come down
now?"
We all walked down to his room.
"Cod, 1 hope he doesn't think you're a guy and
come to the door in his shorts," one friend said
on the way. "We should've told him your
name."
Dankworth opened the door, his pants half
way on and no shirt.
"Ah, nice to meet you?" he said.
He shook his head and laughed.
"I should have known."

dominion of sports writing a year ago.
Often times reporting is frustrating, agoniz
ing, tiring and painful.
Old male die-hard fans and writers find it re
pulsive that a female dares to step foot near a
baseball diamond, football field or locker room.
Yet as I learn to laugh off the criticism, roll
with the punches and keep from feeling the need
to prove myself to the male populace, sportswrit
ing becomes easier, a lot more fun and brings
rewarding friendships.
Women sports writers stil 1 face more obstacles
than a hurdler. Nowadays sports writing focuses
less on the play-by-play and more on the
thoughts, problems and personal lives of
athletes. Women can be at a disadvantage af
getting close to their sources. There is too much
misunderstanding — too much innuendo if you
try.
—Johnny Bench sure thought so. Our phone
conversation last spring went like this:
Me: "I'd like to get together with you while
you're in town to . . . "
Bench: "My schedule is pretty tight, but ..."
Me: "It will only take a few minutes."
Bench: "Oh, well, how aboutafter the game —
or, babe, let's have breakfast tomorrow at the
hotel."
—One big Stanford defensive player put me
on the defensive during an interview last fall. As
we watched "Monday Night Football" he "mel
lowed out" a little too much.
"I'm serious," 1 said.
"Me too," was the reply.
—In a room where the athletes met writers
after the East-West Shrine game last Jan. 2. I
chatted with a quarterback from my home state
of Wisconsin. As one West squad member
walked in the room, he smiled at me and came
over and pinched me.
—Last month when I introduced myself to
football coach Bill Walsh he said he hadn't ex
pected a woman football writer. Then when I set
up an appointment for our interview the follow
ing morning at 9a.m., lie said kiddingly, "Let me
write down your title because my wife will never
believe me."
—Late one Thursday night during the basket
ball season, the Daily got a phone call.
"Sports, you've got a call," a news writer yel
led.
Since I was the only one around who knew the
. difference between a free throw and a field goal.

I took (he call.
"May 1 help you?"
"1 want sports. Where's Chris Baker?" the
man's voice said a little anncfyed.
"He isn't here. But 1 am a sports editor. 1
KNOW SPORTS. I can help you," 1 said harshly.
"Who is this?"
"Jill Lieber," 1 said looking at the clock spell
out 1:30 a.m. The call was obviously one of those
the Daily gets from fans who want to know some
obscure fact like when the national tiddly winks
tournament will be held.
"Oh, hi Jill," he said as if he knew me.
This guy was too much. Maybe even a little too
friendly for this late hour.
"Would you like some help?" 1 was quickly
losing my temper.
"This is Bob Frederick (assistant basketball
coach)."
There I was in my usual position — with my
foot in my mouth.
—In November I flew with the football team to
Eugene for the Oregon-Stanford game. 1 was
mistaken by some of the freshmen players as a
coach's daughter. I got strange looks from the
Oregon ians who saw 40 huge guys and me roam
ing around the lobby of the motel.
But perhaps the funniest look was that on
UCLA quarterback Jeff Dankworth's face.
UCLA was also staying in Eugene that night
because they were playing Oregon State the next
afternoon and Corvallis has very little in the
ways of motels or restaurants. 1 had dinner with
two writers from the UCLA Daily Bruin and we
went back and watched T.V. in their room. Two
players next door were wrestling and throwing
each other against the walls. Most of the others
were telling jokes along with coach Terry
Donahue downstairs in front of the lobby's firep
lace.
My friend turned to me, "Ready to meet
Dankworth?" Ever since the Arizona State game
at the end of the summer I had wanted to inter
view Dankworth especially to see how he hand
led all the publicity from Sports Illustrated and
national T.V.
They called his room.
"Jeff, there's a sports editor herefrom Stanford
who didn't get a chance to talk to you when
Stanford was down in L A. Can we come down
now?"
We all walked down to his room.
"Cod, 1 hope he doesn't think you're a guy and
come to the door in his shorts," one friend said
on the way. "We should've told him your
name."
Dankworth opened the door, his pants half
way on and no shirt.
"Ah, nice to meet you?" he said.
He shook his head and laughed.
"I should have known."
