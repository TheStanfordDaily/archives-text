Washington (AP) — In bizarre sequ
ence, terrorist gunmen invaded the
headquarters of a Jewish organization,
a Moslem religious center and
Washington's City Hall yesterday, kil
ling a radio newsman and seizing
scores of hostages.
Police say 9 to 11 hlack men cap
tured their hostages yesterday and still
held at least 80 people at three diffe
rent locations early today.
Police ringed the three buildings,
and sealed off the areas involved, in

eluding Pennsylvania Avenue, close
to the White House, and Mas
sachusetts Avenue, in the heart of Em
bassy Row.
The gunmen, armed with rifles,
shotguns, some automatic weapons
and a machete, were thought to be
members of the predominantly black
llanafi Moslem sect, victimized by a
mass murder in Washington four years
ago.
Their apparent ringleader said he
wanted revenge for the 197U killing of
the seven Hanafi Moslems, six of them
his children.
He demanded that the people he
holds responsible — leaders of the
rival Black Muslim sect — be delivered
to the terrorists holding nearly 60 hos
tages at the headquarters of B'nai
B'rith, the Jewish service organization.
Khalifa Hamaas Abdul Khaalis also
demanded, and got, cancellation of
American showings of the film
Mohammad, Messengeroj Cod. which
he said was an affront to his religion.
His were the only public demands.
"Heads will be chopped off. a killing
room will be set up at B'nai B'rith and
heads will be thrown out of windows."
said Abdul Aziz from the Hanafi sect
headquarters, a Tudor-style home in
the city's upper Northwest section.
Aziz. 35. is Abdul Khaalis' son-in-law.
The slain newsman was Maurice
Williams. 24. a black reported for
WHUR. a station affiliated with How
ard University Williams was killed by
a gun shot during the takeover at the
District of Columbia Building, two
blocks from the White House.
There was shooting at the B'nai
B'rith building, too. where four to six
men, led by Abdul Khaalis. terrorized
office workers in a late morning inva
sion.
Eight people there were reported
wounded — shot, stabbed or beaten.

Four more were injured at the Dis
trict Building, one of them City Coun
cilman Marion Barry, who was shot in
the chest.
There were no known casualties at
the third site, the Islamic Center, a
mosque on Washington's Embassy
Row. Federal agents said three gun
men mere wore armed with two shot
guns and a rifle.
Late last night, a police spokesman
said foreign diplomats were negotiat
ing with the six gunmen who were at
B'nai B'rith. holding their hostages in
an unfinished cafeteria on the eighth
floor.
Two other deputy police chiefs were
conducting negotiations with the in
truders at the District Building and at
the mosque.
The sequence began at the head
quarters of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish ser
vice organization. That seemed to be
the central incident.
