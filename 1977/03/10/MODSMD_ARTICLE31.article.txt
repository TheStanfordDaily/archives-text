# Fresno State upsets Card spikers
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Three decades of Stanford
track and field supremacy over
Fresno State ended Saturday as
the Bulldogs downed the Cardi
nals, 85-78.
Strong performances by Stan
ford's sprinters and middle
distance runners did not com
pensate for an 18-point advan
tage gained by the Bulldogs with
sweeps in the high hurdles and
the pole vault.
The Fresno victory was its first
against Stanford since 1942. the
Cards having won the last 24
meetings.
Although they led the meet
from start to finish, the Fresno
cindermen had to wait until the
completion of the second-to-last
event — the two-mile clinching
their long-awaited win.
With two events left. Stanford

had to finish one-two in the
two-mile and then win the mile
relay in order to keep its streak
against Fresno intact.
Senior Jeff Parietti and
sophomore Jerry took
early command of the eight-lap
race. But Fresno's Bob Deis over
took the Card pair in the last
half-mile to win the race in
8:53.4 and give the Bulldogs a
hard-fought victory.
Parietti and Emory ran
lifetime bests of 8:55.6 and
9:00.6 in their futile, last-ditch
effort to save Stanford the em
barrassment of losing to Fresno
State.
16 personal bests
Notwithstanding the loss to
the Bulldogs. 16 Cardinals re
corded personal bests and two
other Stanford track men equal
led previous bests. In addition.

the Cardinal relay foursomes
turned in a pair of outstanding
early-season marks,
The 400-meter relay team of
Marvin Holmes, James Lofton,
Gordon Hanks and Alan Sheats
recorded the second fastest Stan
ford sprint relay mark ever as
they won the one-lap race in
40.2. Banks and Holmes finished
one-two in the 100-meters as
Banks equalled the Stanford
freshman mark with a 10.6
clocking.
Saturday, Banks was part of a
Stanford sweep in the 200-
meters. Lofton, Banks and
Holmes completed the only Card
sweep of the meet: Lofton win
ning in 21.1
Fresno's Steve Campbell
edged Sheats in the 400-meters.
but Sheats' 46.6 time was a
lifetime best and qualified the

junior from Altadena for the
NCAA finals in June.
Sheats received the baton with
a 10-yard deficit and quickly
moved into a lead which Lofton
maintained over the anchor lap.
Tom Shellworth, Earl (lerfen,
Sheats and Lofton churned out a
3:11.2 mile.
Dave Wells and Steve Crowly
recorded lifetime bests on the
way to victories in the 800 and

Cards having won the last 24
meetings.
Although they led the meet
from start to finish, the Fresno
cindermen had to wait until the
completion of the second-to-last
event — the two-mile clinching
their long-awaited win.
With two events left. Stanford

had to finish one-two in the
two-mile and then win the mile
relay in order to keep its streak
