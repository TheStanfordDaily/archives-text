# Nine-game win streak
## Reynolds sparks Card nine 
### Chris Kamel 
It would seem difficult to top
the performance that the Stan
ford varsity baseball team had
last weekend when the Cards
pounded out 35 hits for a 46-run
total with wins of 16-14, 15-6
and 1 5-0 over San Francisco
State.
Well, center fielder Larry
Reynolds topped it Monday as
the sophomore from Corvallis,
Ore. set a Cardinal career re
cord for stolen bases. Reynolds
stole his 57th and 58th by
shortstop Warren Coodrich. In
that game, a ninth inning rally
by Stanford gave the Cards a 7-6
victory over Stanislaus State.
"They were definitely playing
the best ball of any of the oppo
nents we faced yet," said head
coach Mark Marquess. "They
didn't play that well against us
earlier in the season, but their
strong defense almost beat us."
The pitching of losing Stanis
laus State's John Olliver kept the

Cards in check with only four
hits in eight innings, but Stan
ford put together one of its
patented ninth inning rallies for
the win.
In the bottom of the ninth,
Pepe Hinojosa led off with a
walk and moved to second on
a walk drawn by Reynolds. Paul
Zuvella, playing second for the
injured Todd Ervin, and Kevin
Triggs singled to left field to load
the bases. Cuardino, who came
out of a long slump with a
grand-slam home run over the
weekend, slammed a ground
rule double that bounced over
the fence scoring Hinojosa and
Reynolds. Hallsted picked up
the win and is 3-0 this season.
"We played very good catch
up ball," said Marquess. "1 knew
Tom (Guardino) would come out
of his slump and now our hitting
is looking good."
The Cards ran their winning
streak to nine straight Monday
with a 6-5 comeback win over

San Jose State. Stanford (19-4)
found itself behind at 5-3 in the
eighth inning and with a little
composure and luck rallied for
three runs.
In the bottom of the eighth and
right fielder Mike Codiroli on
second base, third baseman C.ary
Pitchford was robbed of a two
run homer by a leaning catch
over the fence by the San lose
State outfielder.
The Cards came right back,
however, as Xuvella hit a shot
down the third base line and
Codiroli was called safe at the
third base bag. Codiroli scored
and /.uvella took third on a dou
ble by Reynolds and Zuvella
scored the next run when the
San Jose State catcher let a third
strike ball get away from him.
Reynolds capped the three
run burst as he scored on another
error by the Spartan catcher.
Pitcher Bruce Fiala (4-1) opt the
win.
"Larry has been doing it all,"
said Marquess on the perfor
mance of Reynolds. "His play
will be very important to us the
weekend of Mar. 25 when we
start league down at IJSC."
In the three-game San Fran
cisco State sweep, pitchers Jerry
Hattenberg, Brian Harrison and
John Yandle all posted wins.
Yandle, in holding the opposi
tion scoreless on two hits, low
ered his earned run average to
1.09.
"The only thing I'm con
cerned with right now is the
shape of Ervin and Triggs," said
Marquess, "but both ought to be
ready by USC weekend."
