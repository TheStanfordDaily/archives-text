# Cal over Cards, 16-7
## An outsider's view of rugby 
### Stephen Crolius 
The California Colden Bear
rugby side came down to the
Farm last Saturday for <1 match
against our own side of Cardi
nals. The weather was superla
tive and when I arrived at the
"pitch" (one of the many terms
which betray rugby's British
origin) most of the 200 or so
spectators were basking in the
sun while the first team players
warmed up on the field. An
official-1 ooki ng gentleman,
fairly young and heavy set. was
the prominent figure on the
sidelines in a T-shirt
emblazoned "Rugby takes
leather balls."
The gentleman turned out to
be Stanford's John Steinhauser.
who. I learned after the Colden
Bears had kicked off and the
somewhat ragged play had be
gun. wasn't reallv a coach but

more of an unpaid advisor to the
team. Most of the coaching, he
said, was done by several of the
more experienced members of
the team. As he went on to exp
lain the internal dynamics of the
rugby program. I became aware
that he was subtly selling me on
rugby's value for the Universi
ty's athletic repertoire. As I
heard later from other sources,
rugby is not considered one of
the real money-makers for the
sports department and for this or
some other reason, it has been
demoted over the last several
years from .1 varsity to a club
sport and is now faced with the
loss of even that status.
Safe sport
After several minutes of ear
nest discourse, Steinhauser in
troduced me to reserve scrum
mer Cary Marenzi who
explained that rugby actually is

quite safe. The several players
wearing bandages wrapped
around their heads had sus
tained minor ear injuries, he
said, "pretty common" since
these players' duties include
sticking their heads between the
scrummers' legs as they strain to
push the opposing scrum back.
A sudden blare form the
loudspeaker informed us that
the score was now 3-0 in favor of
the ('.olden Bears. 1 hadn't
noticed that anything unusual
had happened on the field but
Marenzi saidCal had scored on a
kick following a penalty.
'Try' again
Just then, Tom Oberhelman.
an identified for me by Marenzi,
picked up the ball in a "loose
play." and passed it to Bill Chris
topher who broke down field,
finding some rather large de
fenders in his path he passed
neatly over to Dennis Shanagher
who sprinted into the end/one
for a four point "try." After Bill
Heckert kicked the conversion,
the Cards were on top 6-3.
In the second half Cal
scored their first try and suc
cessful! completed the conver
sion to make the score 9-(>. I had
learned from Marenzi that the
Cards had gone 5 and 5 on the
season while Cal had only been
beaten twice, so the home team
was naturally very eager for an
upset The action moved up and
down the field with both teams
resorting to cautious punts. At
one poi nt t he center of play came
to rest in front of the stands.
Physically exhausting
In the next two minutes, the
sides traded three point kicks to
bring the score to 1 2-9. Present I \
there was talk of time running
out and the players did not ap
pear quite as frenetic as they had
at the outset. The Cards tried
again and again to taketheattack
to the Cal end, but finally, a Cal
back pulled his way pasi his
exhausted opposition for a try to
put the Colden Bears seven
points ahead. Even though the
conversion attempt failed, time
ran out before the Cards could
mount a serious attack and the
game ended with the score 1(1-7
