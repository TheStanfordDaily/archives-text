pointment by President Jimmy tarter to head the
AC-DA.
In final arguments. Senate Democratic leader
Robert Byrd of West Virginia expressed confidence
that Warnke would make a "tough" negotiator, and
noted that the Senate would make the final decision
on whether to accept any treaty emerging from the
SALT talks.
Senate Republican leader Howard Maker said
Warnke could not be a "credible negotiator because
of his past opposition to "every new weapons system
that has been suggested."
The Senate action ended a four-day debate and
came hours alter Carter told a news conference he
had "complete confidence" in Warnke.

statements and writings in which he advocated de

U.S. votes to condemn Chilean junta
Geneva. Switzerland — The United States broke
with past policy yesterday and joined in a 20-1 vote
in the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning
"constant and flagrant violations of human rights
by the Chilean junta.
At the same time, the U.S. State Department sum
moned home Brady Tyson, the U.S. delegate who
publicly apologized Tuesday for American in
volvement in "subversion" against Chiles Marxist
President Salvador Al lende. who was overt brown by
the Chilean military in 107.i.
Tyson's apology was quickly disavowed bv the
White House and State Department.
President Jimmy Carter told a nationally broadcast
news conference 112 hat he did not have advance notice
of Tyson's remarks, which he characterized as "a
personal expression of opinion by that delegate."
At previous sessions of the U.N. human rights

body, the I' nited States abstained on resolutions crit
ical of Chile. U.S. delegates have often accused the
commission of concentrating on a handful of rights
violators while overlooking major ones like the
Soviet Union.
This year, however, the United States was among
the cosponsors of the resolution — which included
the Soviet I Inion and Cuba — apparently in another
manifestation of President Carter's pledge to de
nounce human rights violations anywhere in the
world.

the House that its proposed inquiries into the two
assassinations are justified, faces the task of silting

U.S. votes to condemn Chilean junta
Geneva. Switzerland — The United States broke
with past policy yesterday and joined in a 20-1 vote
in the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning
"constant and flagrant violations of human rights
by the Chilean junta.
At the same time, the U.S. State Department sum
moned home Brady Tyson, the U.S. delegate who
publicly apologized Tuesday for American in
volvement in "subversion" against Chiles Marxist
President Salvador Al lende. who was overt brown by
the Chilean military in 107.i.
Tyson's apology was quickly disavowed bv the
White House and State Department.
President Jimmy Carter told a nationally broadcast
news conference 112 hat he did not have advance notice
of Tyson's remarks, which he characterized as "a
personal expression of opinion by that delegate."
At previous sessions of the U.N. human rights

body, the I' nited States abstained on resolutions crit
ical of Chile. U.S. delegates have often accused the
commission of concentrating on a handful of rights
violators while overlooking major ones like the
Soviet Union.
This year, however, the United States was among
the cosponsors of the resolution — which included
the Soviet I Inion and Cuba — apparently in another
manifestation of President Carter's pledge to de
nounce human rights violations anywhere in the
world.

FDA bans saccharin sweetener
Washington — The Pood and Drug Administra
tion announced yesterday it is banning saccharin,
the only artificial sweetener approved tor use in the
I 'nited States, because it causes cancer in laboratory
animals.
Acting IDA Commissioner Sherwin Cardner said
it will take at least until July to complete the ad
ministrative requirements before the ban goes into
effect. But tie cailed on manufacturers "to discon
tinue use of sac< hari n as soon as possible, men while
we are drafting the documents needed loai ( omplish
this action."
The I DA said it was not ordering a recall ol the
in.my soft drinks and foods containing the sugar
substitute, saving tests "do not indicate an im
mediate hazard to public health
A similar ban was announced simultaneously bv
the Canadian government whose scientific studies
were the basis for (he I'.S action
American consumers eat or drink more than five
million pounds of saccharin a year, about three
fourths of it in diet soft drinks and the rest in coffee,
tea and dietetic foods, such as canned fruits, gelatin
deserts, jams, ice creams and puddings.
It also has been used in some mouthwashes,
(osmetics and over-the-counter drugs.
I'he Canadian study involved feeding KM) rats a
diet ol five per cent pure saccharin for their entire
lives, from com eption until death, fourteen of those
rats developed cancerous bladder tumors compared
tn two such tumors in a group of KM) animals given
no saccharin
In order to consume an equivalcnt amount of sa< •
(harill. a person would have to drink 800 12-ount e
diet sodas a day for a lifetime, the I DA said
