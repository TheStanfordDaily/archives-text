# J.P. Stevens labor policies prompted campus controversy
## The

### Martin Kemberg Jim Tranquada News analysis 
J.P. Stevens & Co., the second largest
textile manufacturer in the United
States, has been found guilty of dis
criminatory employment practices,
wiretapping of union organizers, tax
evasion, industrial piracy and price
fixing.
Cited repeatedly for unsafe machin
ery. Stevens maintains plants with
noise levels far higher than federal
regulations allow. The level of cotton
dust causing brown lung disease is
three times above federal limits.
The University abstained from vot
ing on March 1 on a Stevens stockhol
der resolution which called for disclo
sure of company labor practices and
policies.
The abstention was in disregard of a
recommendation from the Presidential
Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (C-IK). a petition bearing over
1 600 student and staff signatures, and
,i confrontation with students during a
sit-in hours before the vote.
At the stockholders' meeting, both
resolutions were overwhelmingly de
feated. The second resolution, on
which the University abstained, was
supported by only six per cent of the
stockholders. However, both resolu
tions received enough support to place
them before the share owners at next
year's meeting.
The Stevens controversy here raises
three questions:
—What interest does the University
have in Stevens?
—What determined the final Uni
versity vote on the Stevens proxy re
solutions?

—What was the response of the
Stanford community to the Universi
ty's changing positions?
Interests in J.P. Stevens
The University holds 3000 shares.
0.025 per cent of the total of voting
securities (11.6 million shares). The
University holds the stock in a be
neficiary trust, with the donors of the
stock currently receiving any di
vidends. Only after the donors die do
dividends revert to Stanford. The Uni
versity does retain voting privileges,
however.
Factors behind the vote
To understand what determined the
University's final vote, it is necessary
to examine the two positions the Uni
versity assumed. Initially, the Univer
sity declared that its holdings of Ste
vens stock were insignificant, and that
the financial benefits of voting were
directly proportional. Thus it planned
to abstain on the two resolutions and
not refer the matter to the C-IR.
The University then reconsidered,
and after referring the matter to the
C-IK. said it would vote yes on the first
resolution, which would require Ste
vens to release affirmative action and
equal opportunity figures. The Uni
versity chose to abstain on the second,
which would require release of de
tailed labor policy and practices in
formation.
The administration justified its posi
tions in several different ways.
Rodney Adams, director of finance,
stated that support of the first resolu
tion is in keeping with past University
action. Previously, Robert Au
gsburger. vice president for business
and finance, had stated "we have to

channel our energies ... to those is
sues more under the policy guidelines
of the University."
Augsburger, in a Feb. 24 letter to
Stevens, attempted to clarity this dis
crepancy by pointing out that the in
formation requested by the first resolu
tion "is little different from that re
quired by law." and that failure to re
veal that information might lead to
"exposure to significant damages re
sulting from class action suits."
In addition, the second resolution
might be detrimental to stockholders'
interest, and since the resolution pro
vides an "out" (according to Au
gsburger) for Stevens, it wouldn't be
effective anyway. Stevens could avoid
supplying the requested information
by claiming it would be detrimental to
the company's business.
Finally, pressured to further justify
its decision, the University main
tained that the case made against Ste
vens is one-sided and inconclusive, as
the company has not chosen to defend
itself.
Critics of the University's position,
however, suggested other motives
were decisive in the determination of
the University decision. Douglas
Gamble, a lecturer in history, pointed
out that by overriding the C-IR's re
commendations, the University put
the bulk of its defense on asserting that
the economic cost of voting yes on the
second resolution was too high.
Yet profit losses from a national
boycott of Stevens goods and the con
current decline of the value of Stevens
stock from $37 to $19V 2 per share on
Wall Street contradict this position.
Gamble noted.
Merrill Lynch has warned prospec
tive stock purchasers about further
losses, according to Peter Necarsulmer
of the ad hoc J.P. Stevens Committee.
The real reason for the University's
abstention. Gamble alleged, is that it
fears the repurcussions of going on re
cord in favor of the release of detailed
labor and wage information, which
United Stanford Employees (USE)
could use against the University in
USE organizing efforts.
Members of the group who partici
pated in the Feb. 28 sit-in further al
leged that persons making the deci
sion came from a corporate
background, and were insensitive, if
not hostile, to organized labor and
humanitarian concerns in business.
These critics allege the University
abstained on the second resolution be
cause a yes vote would have set a pre
cedent of social concerns overriding
the profit criterion.

This would introduce further di
lemmas tor the University's invest
ments in corporations involved in
questionable business practices or
with repressive governments abroad.
Response on campus
I he response of the Stanford com
munity was an important contributory
lactor toward the change in the Uni
versity's position. The Stevens Com
mittee ultimately collected signatures
of about 15 per cent of the student
body, starting with 500 signatures in a
single day.
This, in combination with support
of the ASSI! Council of Presidents, the
Daily, and the C-IR, put considerable
pressure on the University to recon
sider its initial position.
The University did not anticipate
the immediate and extensive response
that took place. "You . . . have raised
the level of consciousness . . . higher
than expected." Augsburger told the
student protesters prior to the sit-in.
This response can be attributed to a
variety of factors.
Hoyd Leedom, a former National
Labor Relations Board chairman, has
declared, "J.P. Stevens is so out of
touch with a humane, civilized ap
proach to industrial relations that it
would shock even those least sensitive
to honor, justice and decent treat
ment." The clarity of the issues in
volved facilitated the involvement of
students into actively supporting the
two resolutions.
The resolutions themselves left a
loophole through which Stevens
could avoid making damaging disclo
sures.
The fluctuating position of the I'ni
versity. its overriding of the C-IR. and
disregard of popular opinion on cam
pus aroused indignation and led some
to question whether the University
was disregarding its own stated policy
and avoiding the central question of
what moral obligations the University
has as a progressive institution.
The response of the community here
indicated the principles involved in
the Stevens case, regardless of the sig
nificance of economic considerations,
may succeed in influencing Univer
sity investment policies.
More extensive student and faculty
involvement is likely in forthcoming
battles over Stanford's business rela
tionships.
The next case on the horizon is the
Republic of South Africa, according to
students.
