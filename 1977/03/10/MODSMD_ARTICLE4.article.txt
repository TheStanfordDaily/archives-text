Dr. Norman Shumwav's derision against reappointing four community sur
geons to the Stanford Hospital medical staff and against granting them privileges
is "without authority." according to Vice President of Medical Affairs Clayton
Rich.
Rich said yesterday that Shumway. chief of cardiovascular surgery, can ex
press his viewpoint, but tfiat only the medical staff credentials committee can
submit non-clinical faculty reappointment recommendations to the medical
board and the board of hospital directors.
The hospital and University do not plan to reduce the privileges of Dr. Thomas
Poparty. one o! the community surgeons. Rich said.
In a March 1 letter to Medical Director Dr. Robert Alvvav. Shumway wrote that
"tlii! operating room and bed situation over the past several months" forced him
to not reappoint the surgical team consisting of Pogarty and Doctors V V ally Buch.
John Mehigan and Robert Pipkin.
Shumway also noted that "the academic effort" in his department was "seri
ously impeded by the current situation and that since no contribution comes
from Pogartv's unit. I feel constrained to recommend that the latter seek to
establish themselves outside the Stanford umbrella at nearby Sequoia or Penin
sula Hospitals."
According to Pogarty. "We're staying at Stanford. Peninsula has had equip
ment but no open heart surgery. . . . I've indicated I'd provide direction and help.
He said his team intends to practice at both Stanford and Peninsula hospitals
and that at least three of its members are long-time Peninsula staff surgeons.
Pogarty's group will develop Peninsula's cardiovascular surgery program as
"an addition, not to supplant its Stanford work." Peninsula Hospital Adminis
trator Charles Mason said yesterday.
Shumway refused to comment on his letter.
