# Ivies, GSB do it
## Mandatory course ratings not rare 
### Kathy Trafton 
It Stanford adopts a system of man
datory course evaluations, it won t be
the first university to do so.
Last month, the ASSI l Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality called
for mandatory evaluations of all
courses here. Similar programs al
ready exist at the (Graduate School ol
Business here, and at Princeton. Har
vard and Yale. They work with varying
levels of success.
Robert (aedicke. associate dean ol
the (Graduate School of Business, said
that the administration-distributed
questionnaires are used tor three pur
poses.
—as a tool to improve courses.
—as a basis for promotions, salary
increases and reappointments: and
—as an aid for students selecting
their elective courses.
Required courses
Although all courses are evaluated
by students, only elective classes rat
ings are made public. Second-year
students, who take mostly elective
courses, get the most benefit from the
published results, laedicke said.
Evaluation forms at the Business
School include specific questions to be
answered on a scale ol one to seven.
These are the results that ar.e made
public, and the mean for each particu
lar professor can be compared to the
school-wide norm.
Open-ended questions that students
till out are for the benefit of professors
only.
The ASSI' distributes course evalu
ation forms to some undergraduate
classes here. Both scaled and open
ended questions are asked, and results
are published in the ASS 17 Course
Guide.
However, the task force has recom

mended that a single administrative
office distribute the forms to every
class each time it is offered and that a
standard form be used to encourage
both intra- and inter-departmental
comparison of teaching.
Valuable input
Students can provide valuable input
into tenure decisions through such
evaluations, the task force report said.
Students are particularly suited to
judge classroom performance, class
room preparation, accessibility to
students, prompt return of papers and
the overall course design.
Henry Bienen. former chairman of
the Department of Politics at Prince
ton. said Stanford undergraduates do
not show much discrimination in
course evaluation results published in
the ASSI' Course Guide.
"1 can't tell if it's the form of the
evaluation or if Stanford students view
their courses differently. I hope it's the
former." he said.
Evaluation forms at Princeton do not
jji\-e scope for such intuitive, emotive,
nonintellectually oriented student re
sponses, he said. Princeton students'
evaluations reflect more concern with
the intellectual content and the or
ganization of courses than did the
Stanford evaluations, he added.
Computer cards
At Princeton, computer cards are
distributed to students by the Regis
trar's Office, and students evaluate
courses on a 1-5 scale. I he results of
these evaluations are made public to
aid students in selecting courses.
Bienen said he took these printouts
into consideration when making sal
ary recommendations as a department
chairman.
Princeton students are also asked to
fill out separate sheets with comments
on the courses. These comments are
for the use of instructors to improve
classes, and are not made public.
Princeton has been using its present
system since the late 19605, according
to Bienen. It has become an "in
stitutionalized process," and 80 to 90
per cent of the students complete the
questionnaires, Bienen said.
David Berenbeim. a medical student
here who was an undergraduate at
Yale, said Yale students fill out com
puter cards similar to the Princeton
cards.
However, an essay compiled by two
or three students is published by the
Yale Daily News along with the com
puter printout.
Berenbeim said the evaluations af
fect junior faculty the most since they

"often don't have a self-image yet."
Evaluation results usually do not
change old professors who have been
giving the same lecture for 25 years, he
noted.
In contrast, the Harvard course
evaluation system is "terribly informal
and unsystematic," according to a
former Harvard undergraduate.
A course guide is published by the
Harvard Crimson In it, only major in
troductory courses are covered, so that
it is useless for any upper division
work.
Some professors at Harvard distri
bute evaluation forms for personal use.
Also, some evaluation of teaching by
other professors occurs within de
partments.
The student said many professors
would feel threatened by a formal and
systematic evaluation process.

ings are made public. Second-year
students, who take mostly elective
courses, get the most benefit from the
published results, laedicke said.
Evaluation forms at the Business
School include specific questions to be
answered on a scale ol one to seven.
These are the results that ar.e made
public, and the mean for each particu
lar professor can be compared to the
school-wide norm.
Open-ended questions that students
till out are for the benefit of professors
only.
The ASSI' distributes course evalu
ation forms to some undergraduate
classes here. Both scaled and open
ended questions are asked, and results
are published in the ASS 17 Course
Guide.
However, the task force has recom

mended that a single administrative
office distribute the forms to every
class each time it is offered and that a
standard form be used to encourage
both intra- and inter-departmental
comparison of teaching.
Valuable input
Students can provide valuable input
into tenure decisions through such
evaluations, the task force report said.
Students are particularly suited to
judge classroom performance, class
room preparation, accessibility to
students, prompt return of papers and
the overall course design.
Henry Bienen. former chairman of
the Department of Politics at Prince
ton. said Stanford undergraduates do
not show much discrimination in
course evaluation results published in
the ASSI' Course Guide.
"1 can't tell if it's the form of the
evaluation or if Stanford students view
their courses differently. I hope it's the
former." he said.
Evaluation forms at Princeton do not
jji\-e scope for such intuitive, emotive,
nonintellectually oriented student re
sponses, he said. Princeton students'
evaluations reflect more concern with
the intellectual content and the or
ganization of courses than did the
Stanford evaluations, he added.
Computer cards
At Princeton, computer cards are
distributed to students by the Regis
trar's Office, and students evaluate
courses on a 1-5 scale. I he results of
these evaluations are made public to
aid students in selecting courses.
Bienen said he took these printouts
into consideration when making sal
ary recommendations as a department
chairman.
Princeton students are also asked to
fill out separate sheets with comments
on the courses. These comments are
for the use of instructors to improve
classes, and are not made public.
Princeton has been using its present
system since the late 19605, according
to Bienen. It has become an "in
stitutionalized process," and 80 to 90
per cent of the students complete the
questionnaires, Bienen said.
David Berenbeim. a medical student
here who was an undergraduate at
Yale, said Yale students fill out com
puter cards similar to the Princeton
cards.
However, an essay compiled by two
or three students is published by the
Yale Daily News along with the com
puter printout.
Berenbeim said the evaluations af
fect junior faculty the most since they

"often don't have a self-image yet."
Evaluation results usually do not
change old professors who have been
giving the same lecture for 25 years, he
noted.
In contrast, the Harvard course
evaluation system is "terribly informal
and unsystematic," according to a
former Harvard undergraduate.
A course guide is published by the
Harvard Crimson In it, only major in
troductory courses are covered, so that
it is useless for any upper division
work.
Some professors at Harvard distri
bute evaluation forms for personal use.
Also, some evaluation of teaching by
other professors occurs within de
partments.
The student said many professors
would feel threatened by a formal and
systematic evaluation process.
It Stanford adopts a system of man
datory course evaluations, it won t be
the first university to do so.
Last month, the ASSI l Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality called
for mandatory evaluations of all
courses here. Similar programs al
ready exist at the (Graduate School ol
Business here, and at Princeton. Har
vard and Yale. They work with varying
levels of success.
Robert (aedicke. associate dean ol
the (Graduate School of Business, said
that the administration-distributed
