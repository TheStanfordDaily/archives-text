# Satellite contract: The next move is Iran's
## 
### Mike Charison Jim Tranquada 
It is up to Iran to make the next move in the con
tinuing efforts to clear up a misunderstanding in
volving the University in a contract with National
Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT).
The University now awaits the decision of NIRT
on whether 15 final contract reports are in keeping
with the spirit and letter of the contract.
NIRT acknowledged the receipt of the reports two
weeks ago. The University submitted them in com
pletion of its contract obligations with the Iranians,
according to Earl Cilley, director of sponsored pro
jects.
Approximately $425,000 remains unpaid by the
Iranians as of this week, Cilley said. NIRT has still
not clarified the specifics of the dissatisfaction
which prompted the organization to terminate its
contract with the University last November.
Educational TV
The $978,000 contract called for Assoc. Electrical
Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignanand Communica
tion Prof. Edwin Parker to plan a domestic telecom
munications satellite system and to develop prog
ramming recommendations for educational televi
sion in Iran.
The reports were shipped to Iran on Feb. 18, Cilley
said, and the University received confirmation that
NIRT had received them on Feb. 22 or 23.

"We expect a response within a few weeks from
Teheran," Cilley said. "Having demonstrated our
good faith in the matter, we expect Iran will do
likewise by paying the remainder of the cost of the
work as agreed."
Vice Provost for Research William Massy said the
University is "prepared to meet with Iranian officials
and clarify any points in the reports."
'Not forthcoming'
"But if payment is not forthcoming," Massy said,
"we are prepared to pursue whatever channels are
appropriate." He refused to elaborate on what consti
tutes an appropriate channel.
However, "we are looking into all available chan
nels for getting the money, and legal channels is one
of them." Mike Hudnall, staff counsel for the Office
of Business and Finance has said.
A faculty group, appointed by Massy, reaffirmed
confidence in the University's performance of the
contract.
"There is a written contract." said Adjunct Elec
trical Engineering Prof. H. Taylor Howard, "and
what our report says is that the work fulfills the
contract. We were unanimous in our opinion."
Communication Prof. Lyle Nelson agreed but
added that the vagueness of the work statement
somewhat hindered the committee's work. "The
contract isn't all that clearly drawn and we would
have liked to have it more specific," Nelson said.

Some discussion
Massy said some discussion has taken place
within the Committee on Research on possible revi
sions to administrative procedures on contracts
here. The proposals would attempt to minimize the
likelihood of misunderstandings in the future.
Nelson said his committee's work did not include
formulation of new policy proposals but that in his
opinion "having the details (of contract work state
ments) spelled out would be a much better situa
tion."
Lusignan said he felt part of the misunderstanding
arose because, until the final reports were compiled,
the Iranians' view of the work was fragmented.
"Until you get everything pulled together in a
final report, it is hard to see exactly what the recom
mendations are." he said.
Both hardware and software portions of the con
tract, Lusignan said, were put together in such a way
as to have relevance in situations outside Iran.
Other countries have expressed an interest in simi
lar contracts with the University, he said, but no
negotiations have actually started, and none will
until NIRT responds to the reports submitted.
But Lusignan said he hoped the University would
engage in similar work in the future since that had
been the plan all along. "Details are somewhat diffe
rent with different countries, but the overall ap
proach is the same." he said.
