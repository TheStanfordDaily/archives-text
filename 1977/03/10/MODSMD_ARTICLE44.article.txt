# 'Governor Stanford' neglected?
## 
### Robert Lempert 
A $250,000 antique locomotive known as the "Covernor
Stanford" is being neglected and mistreated, according to
Lorenz Eitner, chairman of the Art Department.
The locomotive, owned by the University, was loaned out
more than 10 years ago. It is now held by the Pacific Coast
chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society
and is being stored in the back of a Safeway warehouse in
Sacramento.
Eitner said the engine has received unauthentic paint
jobs modifying its red and black color scheme. Several
gauges and other fittings from the cab have been stolen and
the engine seems generally dirty, he added.
These charges were denied by Dr. Denny Anspach, head
of the society, in a letter to President Richard Lyman. I he
engine is well cared for, according to Anspach.
Anspach said his society eventually plans to include the
locomotive in the $5 million state museum of railroad his
tory being built as part of a redevelopment program in
Sacramento. Though still officially I 'niversitv property, the
"Governor Stanford" is to be the centerpiece of this new
display.
The old diamond-stack locomotive first arrived in
California in 1863 and was one of the first to run on the
state's rails.
One of its original duties was to help in construction of
the transcontinental railroad. After HO years of service, the
"Covernor Stanford" was given as a gift to 1 .eland Stanford
bv the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The engine arrived on campus in 1894 and in 1910 was
put on display in the rotunda of the Stanford Museum. It
remained there for 47 years.
In 19R3, a Berkeley railroad buff willed his collection of
antique locomotives to the city of San Francisco for the
purpose of forming a transportation museum at the base of

Hyde Street in conjunction with the Maritime Museum now
there.
The "Governor Stanford" was loaned to the group or
ganizing the project for an indefinite period of time. The
endeavor fell through, and in what San Francisco officials
termed "the great train robbery," all the locomotives ended
up in Sacramento, where they have remained until now.
Eitner said he feels Stanford should assert its claim on the
locomotive. If the University waits too long, the issue of
ownership may become clouded, he claimed, and the Uni
versity may have trouble holding on to its property.
Anspach has already printed postcards that describe the
engineas having been "evicted" from theStanford Museum
because of building modifications and being on "semiper
manent loan."
Eitner said the terms of the loan originally drawn up with
the now nonexistent San Erancisco Museum ot Transporta
tion should be rewritten to account for the engine's new
circumstances.
Not only should technical matters such as liability and
insurance be discussed, he said, but the engine should he
put on one-year renewable loan so the University can be
sure its property is being properly cared for and also to
make it possible for the engine to return to campus some
day.
if the "Governor Stanford" ever is brought to Halo Alto.
Eitner said he has several plans tor it. It could always be put
back in its old spot in the museum or placed in an authentic
railway shed somewhere nearby.
It might also be a display in the Terman engineering
building as a technological relic. Wherever it is put, Eitner
maintained, the old locomotive would get better care from
professionals at the Stanford Museum than under the state
Department of Parks and Recreation, which has little ex
perience caring for historical artifacts.

bv the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The engine arrived on campus in 1894 and in 1910 was
put on display in the rotunda of the Stanford Museum. It
remained there for 47 years.
In 19R3, a Berkeley railroad buff willed his collection of
antique locomotives to the city of San Francisco for the
purpose of forming a transportation museum at the base of

Hyde Street in conjunction with the Maritime Museum now
there.
The "Governor Stanford" was loaned to the group or
ganizing the project for an indefinite period of time. The
endeavor fell through, and in what San Francisco officials
termed "the great train robbery," all the locomotives ended
up in Sacramento, where they have remained until now.
Eitner said he feels Stanford should assert its claim on the
locomotive. If the University waits too long, the issue of
ownership may become clouded, he claimed, and the Uni
versity may have trouble holding on to its property.
Anspach has already printed postcards that describe the
engineas having been "evicted" from theStanford Museum
because of building modifications and being on "semiper
manent loan."
Eitner said the terms of the loan originally drawn up with
the now nonexistent San Erancisco Museum ot Transporta
tion should be rewritten to account for the engine's new
circumstances.
Not only should technical matters such as liability and
insurance be discussed, he said, but the engine should he
put on one-year renewable loan so the University can be
sure its property is being properly cared for and also to
make it possible for the engine to return to campus some
day.
if the "Governor Stanford" ever is brought to Halo Alto.
Eitner said he has several plans tor it. It could always be put
back in its old spot in the museum or placed in an authentic
railway shed somewhere nearby.
It might also be a display in the Terman engineering
building as a technological relic. Wherever it is put, Eitner
maintained, the old locomotive would get better care from
professionals at the Stanford Museum than under the state
Department of Parks and Recreation, which has little ex
perience caring for historical artifacts.
A $250,000 antique locomotive known as the "Covernor
Stanford" is being neglected and mistreated, according to
Lorenz Eitner, chairman of the Art Department.
The locomotive, owned by the University, was loaned out
more than 10 years ago. It is now held by the Pacific Coast
chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society
and is being stored in the back of a Safeway warehouse in
Sacramento.
Eitner said the engine has received unauthentic paint
jobs modifying its red and black color scheme. Several
gauges and other fittings from the cab have been stolen and
the engine seems generally dirty, he added.
These charges were denied by Dr. Denny Anspach, head
of the society, in a letter to President Richard Lyman. I he
engine is well cared for, according to Anspach.
Anspach said his society eventually plans to include the
locomotive in the $5 million state museum of railroad his
tory being built as part of a redevelopment program in
Sacramento. Though still officially I 'niversitv property, the
"Governor Stanford" is to be the centerpiece of this new
display.
The old diamond-stack locomotive first arrived in
California in 1863 and was one of the first to run on the
state's rails.
One of its original duties was to help in construction of
the transcontinental railroad. After HO years of service, the
