# Construction alters Stanford's face
## 
### Laura Kennedy Will Nixon 
In the 60s, every spring would
find student demonstrations
tearing up the campus. Now it's
the administration that's tearing
up the campus, with a dozen
major construction projects
either being built or in the final
planning stages.
Why this flurry of building at a
time when the University is fi
nancially strapped and tuition is
going up?
Many academic areas like the
Chemistry Department (built in
1900) and the Main Library
(built in 1919) have been woe
fully in need of modernization
and more space for a long time.
And if the University builds
now, it avoids inevitably higher
building costs later.
"The reason that construction
is coming in waves is that the
financing is coming in that
manner. We try to build as soon
as possible to beat inflation,"
says Master Planner Oscar Nel
son.
So cheer up, seniors — if you
can't get into grad school, there's
still a job for you — in construc
tion.
Here is a roundup of the prog
ress on major campus projects:
Chiled water pipe
The bike ride to your last final
may become even more exciting
when you encounter the excava
tion across White Plaza for a
chilled water pipe. However,
metal plates will cover over the
14-foot trenches and half of
White Plaza will be kept open at
all times.
The $246,000 project will
reach from the front of the Law
School to the Mitchell Earth Sci
ences Building and will com
plete the chilled water loop
around the campus, thus impro
ving air conditioning, according
to Ole Christensen, facilities en
gineer.
Main Library Addition
Construction of the Main Lib
rary addition began Feb. 9 and
should be completed in two
years, said Senior Planner Roger
Cairns. So far the excavation is
about half finished. After the ad
dition is completed, remodeling
will be done in the old section of
the library. Architects are now
working on plans for the remod
eling, but nothing definite has
been planned.
The University has decided to
finish the interior construction

of the third floor of the new addi
tion according to Assistant Con
struction Manager Gary Rotzin.
This choice remained open in
the original contract. Another
option to build a fountain has
not yet been decided upon, said
Rotzin.
Hoover Library
The Hoover Library addition
should be finished by the end of
December and open next Feb
ruary. Construction of the $7
million building is on schedule,
according to Senior Planner
Robert Nerrie.
The money has come from a
federal grant to construct the
building as a federal memorial to

Herbert Hoover, according to the
Assistant Director of the Hoover
Institution George Marotta.
However, the institution has to
raise funds to match the gov
ernment grant; but this money
does not have to go to building
the memorial, said Marotta.
Terman Building
The Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Building should be
completed April 27. Construc
tion is on schedule, according to
Senior Planner Carroll Rankin.
Financed by a gift from
Hewlett-Packard, the Terman
building should meet its $9.2
million budget, said Rankin. The
Engineering Department should

be moving in during May and
early June, he added.
Bookstore Addition
Actual construction of the
Bookstore Addition should
begin in the next few weeks, ac
cording to Rankin. Bids for the
building contract have been re
ceived and the contract should
be awarded in the next week.
The estimated $1.9 million con
struction cost will be paid for by
the bookstore, not the Univer
sity, said Rankin.
History Corner
Bids for the History Corner re
novation are scheduled to go out
by the middle of June. A contract

should be signed by early July
with construction beginning by
late July or early August, accord
ing to Nerrie. Construction
probably will take about 21
months, so the new History
Corner should be open for au
tumn quarter, 1979.
Margaret Jacks Hall
Renovation of this outer Quad
building formerly occupied by
the Physiology Department has
been in progress since late
January.
The basement is currently
being excavated and the outer
walls underpinned in prepara
tion for demolition of the in
terior some six to eight weeks
from now.

"Supertank"
Construction of this mammoth
underground tank between Jor
dan Quad and the Medical
Center should be finished in
about six weeks, according to
Christensen.
The $2.8 million tank, de
signed to hold four million gal
lons of chilled water for the Uni
versity's air conditioning sys
tem, will not be operational until
August, after piping to the
power plant has been installed.
Power Plant Expansion
Supertank is one part of an
improvement program for the
power plant near Jordan Quad.
Also planned is construction of
extra office and machine shop

space on the west side of the
plant and a new chiller equip
ment room to the south.
Bids on these two additions go
out at the end of this month.
Tanner Fountain
Construction is expected to
start in mid-April on an orna
mental fountainbetween Hoover
Tower and Memorial Au
ditorium, according to Buckh
out.
Construction on the fountain,
financed by alumnus Obert Tan
ner, will take five months and
cost $160-180,000, said Asso
ciate Planner Roger Buckhout.
Seeley Mudd Chemistry
Building
The new chemistry building
has been in active operation
since the beginning of this quar
ter, but will be formally dedi
cated on Friday at 2:30 p.m.
Bids will be received by the
Planning Office March 22 for in
terior completion of the base
ment and third floor. This
three-month project should start
in early April and cost $270-
300,000, according to Buckhout.
Energy Modifications —
Phase I
Work should start later this
month on modifications to six
major campus buildings to make
them more energy efficient.
The ventilation systems and
chilled water valving and con
trols will be modified in the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing, the Graduate School of Bus
iness, Jordan Hall, the McCul
lough Building (physics), the
Durand Building, and both
wings of the Herrin Biology
Building.
A $242,699 construction con
tract was signed late last month
with Redwood Mechanical.
Energy Modifications —
Phase II
Six other campus buildings
have also been studied for ways
to cut back their energy con
sumption. Design recommenda
tions are being formulated now
by the Planning Office, and final
working drawings for the $200-
250,000 job should be completed
by the end of May, according to
Peter Hopf, facilities engineer
coordinator.
The six buildings are Meyer
Library, Wilbur Hall, the Law
School, the Math Corner, the
Stanford Center for Research a nd
Development in Teaching and
the Varian Physics Laboratory.
