# What to look for at Palo Alto's banks
## 
### Kevin Ohlson 
Stanford has been described as "a rich kid's
school." Yet when it comes to banking, some of
them can't tell compound interest from an over
draft.
According to one banking official, there are
over 25 banking locations within the Palo Alto
city limits. To add to the uncertainty, each bank
claims to give friendly and efficient service.
And, at a glance, each bank seems to offer the
same services.
For most students' checking needs, a "student
plan" is the way to go. These plans vary in cost
from bank to bank. A student checking plan,
featuring unlimited check writing, overdraft
protection and a bank credit card costs $6 per
year at Crocker, and $9 per year at Bank of
America, United California Bank and Wells
Fargo. Security Pacific's Collegiate Plan costs 20
cents per check, but is similar to the student
plans at other banks.
The other banks within biking distance dis
tance of campus — Bank of California, Camino-
California Bank, First National Bank of San Jose
and Union Bank — offer conventional checking
plans. Conventional checking plans at these
banks are free if the minimum monthly balance
is over $300; otherwise, there is a monthly ser
vice change varying from $2 to $3.50.
Of course, all banks offer passbook savings
accounts. While most pay five per cent interest,
all but Weils-Fargo require an activity charge for
more than three withdrawals per quarter. Inci
dentally, the difference in interest compounded
daily or quarterly on a $1000 account is less than
one dollar per year.
Most of the banks participate in the Federally
Insured Student Loan (FISL) program, but it is
available only to customers who have previ
ously borrowed through that bank. Only Bank of
America, Crocker, United California Bank, and
Wells-Fargo are accepting new applications.
Local branches of Cainino-California. First Na
tional and Union Bank do not participate in the
FISL program.
Claiming it is the community's independent
bank, Camino-California Bank is open from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m. and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Fridays.

accounts, they get to know virtually all of their
customers. "This is the only difference between
Bank of America and us." she said. However,
there is a monthly checking service charge of
$3.50 if the minimum balance falls below $300;

above $300 there is no service charge. While the
basic checking service charge at Bank of
America (not a College Plan) is $3.50 per month,
it is based on a sliding scale, and most people
would not pay that much.
Thomas T. Triggs, manager of the First Na
tional Rank, claimed that his bank advantage is
their low consumer loan rates. "They are most
competitive. We have auto loans, and vacation
loans for students who want to study abroad,"
said Triggs. However, to be eligible for a loan,
the bank assumes that the borrower has a source
of income. First National has a walk-up window
open until 6 p.m.
"There is no doubt about it. Stanford students
get preference on everything we do,"said Robert
Hintz, manager of the Hank of California. Ac
cording to Hintz, "a student (on a bike) can just
as easily come here rather than Tresidder. . . To
be honest with you, most banks are the same.
The only thing we have to offer is service, and it
has paid off. Stanford accounts are good ac
counts." Along with vast amounts of parking.
Rank of California has a walk-up window from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. With a parental guarantee, the
bank will issue a Master Charge card.
The Union Rank is just a short trip down Uni
versity Avenue, "we are primarily a business
bank. Oriented toward businesses with over a
million dollars in (annual) sales. We have all the
normal banking services, but no special prog
rams," Kathryn Simmes, personal banking man
ager, said. Union Rank does not have an after
hours window, but they were the first to develop
bank-by-mail.
Security Pacific Rank is the second-largest
bank in California, but according to manager
Lonnie Umbenhower, it is not well known in
Northern California. "If you're off campus, we're
better," says Umbenhower, "because we are a
large bank,yet there is usually very little for a
teller." Security Pacific offers a student Master
Charge, with up to a $500 credit limit, for
sophomores or above. The walk-up window is
open from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. to 4:30
p.m.
An advantage to United California Rank is that
their overdraft protection is to the nearest dollar.
"When you overdraw your account, you only
v'v-.t rv n s iid Joy Ferris, loan pro
.wu» in uu.« , a, even if you're one
dollar over, you are advanced $100. This can
make a big difference in interest rates." Along
with their $1 per month student checking plan
(free in summer). UCH offers a student Master
Charge with a $150 limit. Their walk-up win

dow is open from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. to
5 p.m.
Unlike most banks, the lobby at Crocker is
open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday-
Thursday, and until 6 p.m. on Friday. The
walk-up window is open from 4:30 p.m. to 5
p.m. "We find that a lot of students with early
morning or late afternoon classes appreciate
this," said Robert Norton, Jr., manager of
Crocker Bank.
Norton, who attended Stanford for seven
years, pointed out that Crocker's student plan
had the lowest service charge of any California
bank.
Bank of America is the only bank with a cam
pus representative. Alan Grobman, who has
been the Stanford representative for over two
years, is a Humanities Special Program major
and lives at theTheta Delta Chi house. "We have
set up seminars for med students, and have a
student activity fund for student organizations. . .
We give immediate credit on checks from home,
while other banks may wait for it to clear," said
Grobman.
Bank of America's College Plan is $1 per
month, and it can be used at no charge during
the summer. "Most students qualify for Bank-
Americard, but you must be a sophomore or
above," he said. "We are the only bank to offer
overdraft protection for freshmen."
"Perhaps most people don't realize that we're
a full service bank," said Chris Tanimoto, assis
tant manager at Wells-Fargo's Stanford Campus
branch. We can do everything any of our other
branch offices do, including Telex money to
another bank. Tanimoto also pointed out that
Wells Fargo lends up to $2500 per year to under
graduates under the FISL program, and $3500 to
graduate students, while most banks lend only
$1500 and $2500 respectively. The Student
Checking Plan costs $1 per month during the
year and $1 per month in the summer, unless no
checks are processed. There is a walk-up win
dow open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
While banks in the Palo Alto area offer basi
cally the same services, there are some differ
ences. Some are more receptive to student
needs, while others feature more personalized
service. Virtually all offer a bank credit card. To
establish credit and for check cashing identifica
tion. most bank officials suggest getting either a
Master Charge or BankAmericard. The cards do
not cost anything (unless you fail to pay the
monthly balance) and some banks all but give
them awav.

According to one banking official, there are
over 25 banking locations within the Palo Alto
city limits. To add to the uncertainty, each bank
claims to give friendly and efficient service.
And, at a glance, each bank seems to offer the

For most students' checking needs, a "student
plan" is the way to go. These plans vary in cost
from bank to bank. A student checking plan,
featuring unlimited check writing, overdraft
protection and a bank credit card costs $6 per
year at Crocker, and $9 per year at Bank of
America, United California Bank and Wells
Fargo. Security Pacific's Collegiate Plan costs 20
cents per check, but is similar to the student
plans at other banks.
The other banks within biking distance dis
tance of campus — Bank of California, Camino-
California Bank, First National Bank of San Jose
and Union Bank — offer conventional checking
plans. Conventional checking plans at these
banks are free if the minimum monthly balance
is over $300; otherwise, there is a monthly ser
vice change varying from $2 to $3.50.
Of course, all banks offer passbook savings
accounts. While most pay five per cent interest,
all but Weils-Fargo require an activity charge for
more than three withdrawals per quarter. Inci
dentally, the difference in interest compounded
daily or quarterly on a $1000 account is less than
one dollar per year.
Most of the banks participate in the Federally
Insured Student Loan (FISL) program, but it is
available only to customers who have previ
ously borrowed through that bank. Only Bank of
America, Crocker, United California Bank, and
Wells-Fargo are accepting new applications.

there is a monthly checking service charge of

above $300 there is no service charge. While the
basic checking service charge at Bank of

it is based on a sliding scale, and most people
would not pay that much.
Thomas T. Triggs, manager of the First Na

their low consumer loan rates. "They are most
competitive. We have auto loans, and vacation
loans for students who want to study abroad,"
said Triggs. However, to be eligible for a loan,
the bank assumes that the borrower has a source
of income. First National has a walk-up window
open until 6 p.m.
"There is no doubt about it. Stanford students
get preference on everything we do,"said Robert
Hintz, manager of the Hank of California. Ac
cording to Hintz, "a student (on a bike) can just

Security Pacific Rank is the second-largest
bank in California, but according to manager
Lonnie Umbenhower, it is not well known in
Northern California. "If you're off campus, we're
better," says Umbenhower, "because we are a

sophomores or above. The walk-up window is
open from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. to 4:30

Norton, who attended Stanford for seven

had the lowest service charge of any California
bank.
Bank of America is the only bank with a cam

student activity fund for student organizations. . .
We give immediate credit on checks from home,

Grobman.
Bank of America's College Plan is $1 per

the summer. "Most students qualify for Bank-
Americard, but you must be a sophomore or

"Perhaps most people don't realize that we're
a full service bank," said Chris Tanimoto, assis

Wells Fargo lends up to $2500 per year to under

city limits. To add to the uncertainty, each bank
claims to give friendly and efficient service.
And, at a glance, each bank seems to offer the
same services.
For most students' checking needs, a "student
plan" is the way to go. These plans vary in cost
from bank to bank. A student checking plan,
featuring unlimited check writing, overdraft
protection and a bank credit card costs $6 per
year at Crocker, and $9 per year at Bank of
America, United California Bank and Wells
Fargo. Security Pacific's Collegiate Plan costs 20
cents per check, but is similar to the student
plans at other banks.
The other banks within biking distance dis
tance of campus — Bank of California, Camino-
California Bank, First National Bank of San Jose
and Union Bank — offer conventional checking
plans. Conventional checking plans at these
banks are free if the minimum monthly balance
is over $300; otherwise, there is a monthly ser
vice change varying from $2 to $3.50.
Of course, all banks offer passbook savings
accounts. While most pay five per cent interest,
all but Weils-Fargo require an activity charge for
more than three withdrawals per quarter. Inci
dentally, the difference in interest compounded
daily or quarterly on a $1000 account is less than
one dollar per year.
Most of the banks participate in the Federally
Insured Student Loan (FISL) program, but it is
available only to customers who have previ
ously borrowed through that bank. Only Bank of
America, Crocker, United California Bank, and
Wells-Fargo are accepting new applications.

there is a monthly checking service charge of
$3.50 if the minimum balance falls below $300;

above $300 there is no service charge. While the
basic checking service charge at Bank of
America (not a College Plan) is $3.50 per month,
it is based on a sliding scale, and most people
would not pay that much.
Thomas T. Triggs, manager of the First Na
tional Rank, claimed that his bank advantage is
their low consumer loan rates. "They are most
competitive. We have auto loans, and vacation
loans for students who want to study abroad,"
said Triggs. However, to be eligible for a loan,
the bank assumes that the borrower has a source
of income. First National has a walk-up window
open until 6 p.m.
"There is no doubt about it. Stanford students
get preference on everything we do,"said Robert
Hintz, manager of the Hank of California. Ac
cording to Hintz, "a student (on a bike) can just
as easily come here rather than Tresidder. . . To
be honest with you, most banks are the same.
The only thing we have to offer is service, and it
has paid off. Stanford accounts are good ac

Rank of California has a walk-up window from 9

The Union Rank is just a short trip down Uni

bank. Oriented toward businesses with over a
million dollars in (annual) sales. We have all the
normal banking services, but no special prog

ager, said. Union Rank does not have an after
hours window, but they were the first to develop
bank-by-mail.
Security Pacific Rank is the second-largest
bank in California, but according to manager
Lonnie Umbenhower, it is not well known in
Northern California. "If you're off campus, we're
better," says Umbenhower, "because we are a
large bank,yet there is usually very little for a
teller." Security Pacific offers a student Master
Charge, with up to a $500 credit limit, for
sophomores or above. The walk-up window is
open from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. to 4:30
p.m.
An advantage to United California Rank is that
their overdraft protection is to the nearest dollar.

Unlike most banks, the lobby at Crocker is

Thursday, and until 6 p.m. on Friday. The
walk-up window is open from 4:30 p.m. to 5

this," said Robert Norton, Jr., manager of
Crocker Bank.
Norton, who attended Stanford for seven
years, pointed out that Crocker's student plan
had the lowest service charge of any California
bank.
Bank of America is the only bank with a cam

been the Stanford representative for over two
years, is a Humanities Special Program major
and lives at theTheta Delta Chi house. "We have
set up seminars for med students, and have a
student activity fund for student organizations. . .
We give immediate credit on checks from home,
while other banks may wait for it to clear," said
Grobman.
Bank of America's College Plan is $1 per
month, and it can be used at no charge during
the summer. "Most students qualify for Bank-
Americard, but you must be a sophomore or
above," he said. "We are the only bank to offer
overdraft protection for freshmen."
"Perhaps most people don't realize that we're
a full service bank," said Chris Tanimoto, assis
tant manager at Wells-Fargo's Stanford Campus
branch. We can do everything any of our other
branch offices do, including Telex money to
another bank. Tanimoto also pointed out that
Wells Fargo lends up to $2500 per year to under
graduates under the FISL program, and $3500 to
graduate students, while most banks lend only
$1500 and $2500 respectively. The Student
Checking Plan costs $1 per month during the

not cost anything (unless you fail to pay the

Stanford has been described as "a rich kid's

same services.
For most students' checking needs, a "student
plan" is the way to go. These plans vary in cost
from bank to bank. A student checking plan,
featuring unlimited check writing, overdraft
protection and a bank credit card costs $6 per
year at Crocker, and $9 per year at Bank of
America, United California Bank and Wells
Fargo. Security Pacific's Collegiate Plan costs 20
cents per check, but is similar to the student
plans at other banks.
The other banks within biking distance dis
tance of campus — Bank of California, Camino-
California Bank, First National Bank of San Jose
and Union Bank — offer conventional checking
plans. Conventional checking plans at these
banks are free if the minimum monthly balance
is over $300; otherwise, there is a monthly ser
vice change varying from $2 to $3.50.
Of course, all banks offer passbook savings
accounts. While most pay five per cent interest,
all but Weils-Fargo require an activity charge for
more than three withdrawals per quarter. Inci
dentally, the difference in interest compounded
daily or quarterly on a $1000 account is less than
one dollar per year.
Most of the banks participate in the Federally
Insured Student Loan (FISL) program, but it is
available only to customers who have previ
ously borrowed through that bank. Only Bank of
America, Crocker, United California Bank, and
Wells-Fargo are accepting new applications.
Local branches of Cainino-California. First Na
tional and Union Bank do not participate in the
FISL program.
Claiming it is the community's independent
bank, Camino-California Bank is open from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m. and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Fridays.

accounts, they get to know virtually all of their
customers. "This is the only difference between
Bank of America and us." she said. However,
there is a monthly checking service charge of
$3.50 if the minimum balance falls below $300;

above $300 there is no service charge. While the
basic checking service charge at Bank of
America (not a College Plan) is $3.50 per month,
it is based on a sliding scale, and most people
would not pay that much.
Thomas T. Triggs, manager of the First Na
tional Rank, claimed that his bank advantage is
their low consumer loan rates. "They are most
competitive. We have auto loans, and vacation
loans for students who want to study abroad,"
said Triggs. However, to be eligible for a loan,
the bank assumes that the borrower has a source
of income. First National has a walk-up window
open until 6 p.m.
"There is no doubt about it. Stanford students
get preference on everything we do,"said Robert
Hintz, manager of the Hank of California. Ac
cording to Hintz, "a student (on a bike) can just
as easily come here rather than Tresidder. . . To
be honest with you, most banks are the same.
The only thing we have to offer is service, and it
has paid off. Stanford accounts are good ac
counts." Along with vast amounts of parking.
Rank of California has a walk-up window from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. With a parental guarantee, the
bank will issue a Master Charge card.
The Union Rank is just a short trip down Uni
versity Avenue, "we are primarily a business
bank. Oriented toward businesses with over a
million dollars in (annual) sales. We have all the
normal banking services, but no special prog
rams," Kathryn Simmes, personal banking man
ager, said. Union Rank does not have an after
hours window, but they were the first to develop
bank-by-mail.
Security Pacific Rank is the second-largest
bank in California, but according to manager
Lonnie Umbenhower, it is not well known in
Northern California. "If you're off campus, we're
better," says Umbenhower, "because we are a
large bank,yet there is usually very little for a
teller." Security Pacific offers a student Master
Charge, with up to a $500 credit limit, for
sophomores or above. The walk-up window is
open from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. to 4:30
p.m.
An advantage to United California Rank is that
their overdraft protection is to the nearest dollar.
"When you overdraw your account, you only
v'v-.t rv n s iid Joy Ferris, loan pro
.wu» in uu.« , a, even if you're one
dollar over, you are advanced $100. This can
make a big difference in interest rates." Along
with their $1 per month student checking plan
(free in summer). UCH offers a student Master
Charge with a $150 limit. Their walk-up win

dow is open from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. to
5 p.m.
Unlike most banks, the lobby at Crocker is
open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday-
Thursday, and until 6 p.m. on Friday. The
walk-up window is open from 4:30 p.m. to 5
p.m. "We find that a lot of students with early
morning or late afternoon classes appreciate
this," said Robert Norton, Jr., manager of
Crocker Bank.
Norton, who attended Stanford for seven
years, pointed out that Crocker's student plan
had the lowest service charge of any California
bank.
Bank of America is the only bank with a cam
pus representative. Alan Grobman, who has
been the Stanford representative for over two
years, is a Humanities Special Program major
and lives at theTheta Delta Chi house. "We have
set up seminars for med students, and have a
student activity fund for student organizations. . .
We give immediate credit on checks from home,
while other banks may wait for it to clear," said
Grobman.
Bank of America's College Plan is $1 per
month, and it can be used at no charge during
the summer. "Most students qualify for Bank-
Americard, but you must be a sophomore or
above," he said. "We are the only bank to offer
overdraft protection for freshmen."
"Perhaps most people don't realize that we're
a full service bank," said Chris Tanimoto, assis
tant manager at Wells-Fargo's Stanford Campus
branch. We can do everything any of our other
branch offices do, including Telex money to
another bank. Tanimoto also pointed out that
Wells Fargo lends up to $2500 per year to under
graduates under the FISL program, and $3500 to
graduate students, while most banks lend only
$1500 and $2500 respectively. The Student
Checking Plan costs $1 per month during the
year and $1 per month in the summer, unless no
checks are processed. There is a walk-up win
dow open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
While banks in the Palo Alto area offer basi
cally the same services, there are some differ
ences. Some are more receptive to student
needs, while others feature more personalized
service. Virtually all offer a bank credit card. To
establish credit and for check cashing identifica
tion. most bank officials suggest getting either a
Master Charge or BankAmericard. The cards do
not cost anything (unless you fail to pay the
monthly balance) and some banks all but give
them awav.
