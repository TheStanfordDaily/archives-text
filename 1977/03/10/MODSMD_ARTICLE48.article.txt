# Health service advocates preventive medicine

A Palo Alto health service of
fers an alternative to the high
cost of traditional medicine.
Owned by its members and
operating on a cooperative basis,
the Mid-Penninsula Health Ser
vice (MHS) is a non-profit prog
ram that has attracted 1400
adherents in a year.
"It stresses preventive
medicine rather than taking care
of you once you're sick," says
one new member. "And they're
friendly."
MHS came about because of
the concern of a group of people
about the state of health care de
livery, particularly skyrocketing
costs.
Dr. Halsted Holman, professor
of immunology at the Stanford
Medical School and current
president of Mid-Peninsula's
Board of Directors, says the MHS
approach is designed to provide
"more effective, less costly care
by stressing health education,
preventative care, and member
participation." They make use of
non-physician health profes
sionals such as nurse practition
ers, nutritionists and counselors,
and seek to avoid unnecessary
diagnostic testing, technological
treatment, medication and
surgery.
MHS grew out of more than
two years of research and prep
aration by a planning committee
made up of persons affiliated
with the medical school and var
ious community organizations.
Stanford undergraduates and
graduates contributed to the
planning efforts, and student ac
tivity continues, with the in
volvement of graduate students
from the medical and business
schools and undergraduates
with projects through Action
Research Liaison Organization
(ARLO)and the Human Biology
Program.
The doors of the health center
at 704 Webster were opened last
January.
A year later, over 1400 mem
bers have joined MHS, paying
$12 per year for an individual
membership and $24 for a fam
ily.
Medical and laboratory ser
vices are currently offered on a
fee-for-service basis and covered
by Medicare, Medicaid and
other health insurance plans.
While these fees are somewhat
more reasonable than those
found elsewhere, MHS hopes to
become a pre-paid comprehen
sive health organization within
the next several wars to further

reduce costs.
Primary medical care is pro
vided at the health center by the
health care team consisting of a
physician, a nurse practitioner
and other health personnel. A
home care program is being de
veloped to provide care for those
wishing an alternative to an ex
tended hospital or nursing home
stay.
Part-time specialists on the
MHS staff provide some spe
cialty care; other specialties are
handled through consultation
and referral.
MHS stresses self-care and
health education; just as impor
tant as medical services are the
services nutritionists, health in
surance counselors and pharma
cists.
The pharmacy stresses the use
of generic rather than more
costly brand-name drugs. As a
result of pharmacy consulta
tions, one MHS family has
dramatically reduced its drug
bill. For the husband's hyperten
sion, the pharmacist found a
new set of medications saving
$162 per year. The wife was tak
ing a vitamin supplement cost
ing $71 per year. "With the help
of the pharmacist," she says,
"I've reduced that to $17 per
year."
MHS' first year of operation
has been marked by both success
and frustration. The health ser
vice has grappled with the fi
nancial problems associated
with a fledgling organization;
they are still in the red but hop
ing to balance the books by
summer.
Yet those involved in MHS
have been excited to watch the
organization evolve and ideas
grow into reality.
Mid-Peninsula is founded on
ideals of co-operation and
mutual trust and assistance. It is
easier in principle than in prac
tice, says Planning Director
Jeanne Ewy. "We're struggling
with how close to those ideals
we can stay," she says.
Cooperative member partici
pation in policy-making and fi
nancial management is evi
denced by the network of com
mittees made up of members,
staff and health professionals, all
serving as volunteers.
The Board of Directors,
elected yearly by the member
ship, steers the course of the
growing organization; policy
changes, financial considera
tions and program proposals are
brought before the board and
discussed at their bi-monthly

meetings. The board is com
posed of representatives from
lay and professional fields so
that no interest group is domin
ant.
Ewy explains that many of the
programs and services of MHS
are made possible through the
cooperative efforts of its mem
bers. The members may volun
teer time at the health center on
Webster or at the administrative
offices at 457 Kingsley.
"There is a focus," says Ewy,
"on mutual self-help," and
members are encouraged to in

itiate and participate in prog,
rams in such areas as exercise,
nutrition and alternative holistic
healing approaches.
In a course at Stanford Medi
cal School last quarter, MHS
members and med students
learned side by side about the
management of three chronic
conditions — arthritis, hyper
tension, and diabetes. Stan
Shoor, a medical student who
helped develop the chronic dis
ease program, notes that in the
present acute care system, "there
is little set up to deal with the

slow marching of chronic dis
eases."
He says the course stressed the
fact that the chronic problems
can often be more effectively
handled by the patient and fam
ily than by professionals. The
MHS consumer-students from
the class are now able to act as
lay counselors, assisting people
to assess their own needs and
training them to deal with their
chronic conditions.
The cooperative spirit oper
ates at the individual level as
well. "MHS emphasizes the in

dividuals' role in taking control
of their own health and own
life," explains Ewy. The doctor,
therefore, "acts less as a healer
and more as a physician
consultant."
This is a new approach, since
medical practice is traditionally
dominated by the physician. At
titudes may be slow to change.
Yet one member at Mid-
Peninsula's health center com
ments, "We're treated as equals.
They (the health professionals)
listen to you — which a lot of
doctors don't do."

Whether all the ideas behind
the organization can be put into
action and realize the goals set
by the original planners is as yet
uncertain. In the coming year,
MHS will be evaluating its effec
tiveness and assessing the needs
of its members.
Most members are enthusias
tic. Hal Holman echoes the hope
of many, that the ultimate value
of Mid-Peninsula Health Service
will he "in indicating the way
that health care can and should
be provided in the state and the
nation."
