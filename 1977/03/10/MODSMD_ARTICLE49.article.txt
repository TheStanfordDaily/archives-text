# Bechtel publishes guide
## 'Stanford Student's Guide to Study, Work and Travel Abroad' specially geared for student needs 
### Lisa Sonne 
Are you thinking about studying, working or
traveling abroad?
Early spring quarter the Overseas Oppor
tunities Resource Center (OORC) at Bechtel In
ternational House is coming out with a Stanford
Student's Guide to Study, Work and Travel Ab
road.
"Its scope," said Jeanette Philips, the book's
editor, "is to give essential information and tips.
It's mostly a book of resources specifially for the
Stanford student, so they can know how to get
the information they need in this area."
The 40-page booklet will be-divided into five
sections. "The Essentials" will tell students how
to get a passport and International Student Iden
tification. This section will also give advice on
visas, health innoculations, insurance, customs,
foreign money, and what to do "if you get into
trouble."
The "Study" section "is designed to help you
decide which mode of study is best for you and
to guide your thinking in planning."
It lists possible scholarships and exchanges,
and suggests how to go about getting academic
credit for studies completed outside Stanford's
Overseas programs (special projects can be ar
ranged through SCIRE, for example). Also in
cluded is a "Check List of Basic Questions for
Evaluation of Programs Abroad."
Want to pick grapes in France, cut hay in
Norway or farm on a kibbutz? How about an
archeological dig in Italy or giving innocula
tions in South America? The "Employment"
section discusses a full range of short-term
foreign work possibilities, with tips on how to
find a job — from here and once abroad.
Along with red tape advice, this section stres
ses the realities of long hours, low pay and hard
work that characterize most student jobs abroad
(the vast majority of summer job are in tourist
related business, such as hotel chambermaids or
waiters.)

The "Travel" section covers "getting from
here to there" with cross-cultural advice once
you are there. Allison Brown, a senior majoring
in Cerman, added student insights for this part.
Prom "ASSU Travel Service" to "Volunteers
in Asia" the "Sources of Information" section
lists resources on campus for the interested stu
dent along with the office hours, location, tele
phone number and available services of each
place or group.
I he Bechtel International Center, the campus'
center for foreign visitors (across from the Fa
culty Club, fac ing theTresidder parking lot), is a
place where students can meet people from 84
different countries and territories in a full "I-
Center" calendar or events ranging from "Even
ings Abroad" to ping pong tournaments. Its
bi-weekly International News can be mailed to
students upon request.
Six years ago the staff of the I-Center began to
collect information on work, study and travel
abroad because there was no central place on
campus where this could be found.
What began as a library is now an enthusiasti
cally staffed Overseas Opportunities Resource
Center which draws on the experiences of re
turning students, foreign visitors, and commun
ity members to enrich its information sources
and contacts.
Prompted by the idea of Marcie Axelrad, a
former ASSU travel adviser, Philips has been
working on the book for a year.
"This will take care of most of the basic ques
tions we get (The OORC sometimes get over 30
students a day)," said Philips an OORC adviser.
"It will be something we can tuck under a stu
dents arm, so they can look it over and come
back with more questions."
Philips hopes to give the book out free when
the 1000 copies are ready next quarter, but she
said that up to 50 cents may have to be charged.
If the book is a success, she forsees expanding
and updating it for future editions.

Are you thinking about studying, working or
traveling abroad?
Early spring quarter the Overseas Oppor
tunities Resource Center (OORC) at Bechtel In
ternational House is coming out with a Stanford
Student's Guide to Study, Work and Travel Ab
road.
"Its scope," said Jeanette Philips, the book's
editor, "is to give essential information and tips.
It's mostly a book of resources specifially for the
Stanford student, so they can know how to get
the information they need in this area."
The 40-page booklet will be-divided into five
sections. "The Essentials" will tell students how
to get a passport and International Student Iden
tification. This section will also give advice on
visas, health innoculations, insurance, customs,
foreign money, and what to do "if you get into
trouble."
The "Study" section "is designed to help you
decide which mode of study is best for you and
to guide your thinking in planning."
It lists possible scholarships and exchanges,
and suggests how to go about getting academic
credit for studies completed outside Stanford's
Overseas programs (special projects can be ar
ranged through SCIRE, for example). Also in
cluded is a "Check List of Basic Questions for
Evaluation of Programs Abroad."
Want to pick grapes in France, cut hay in
Norway or farm on a kibbutz? How about an
archeological dig in Italy or giving innocula
tions in South America? The "Employment"
section discusses a full range of short-term
foreign work possibilities, with tips on how to
find a job — from here and once abroad.
Along with red tape advice, this section stres
ses the realities of long hours, low pay and hard
work that characterize most student jobs abroad
(the vast majority of summer job are in tourist
related business, such as hotel chambermaids or
waiters.)

The "Travel" section covers "getting from
here to there" with cross-cultural advice once
you are there. Allison Brown, a senior majoring
in Cerman, added student insights for this part.
