# Charges filed in meat fraud case
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The Monterey County District At
torney's Office yesterday filed crimi
nal charges against 'he owner of two
Hay Area meat packing companies and
two salesmen from the companies, ac
cording to Dep. Hist. Atty. Robert
Moody.
Charles I.emoine. owner of the Blue
Star Meat Co. of San I.eandro and
Arrow Meat Co. of Sunnyvale, and two
salesmen have been charged with one
count of false advertising and another
of violating a temporary restraining
order issued last Thursday by fudge
Vincent Bruno of the Santa Clara
County Superior Court.
That order and a motion for a pre
liminary injunction against I.emoine.
his companies and salesmen, were
filed with the participation of San
Francisco and Monterey counties.
The motion alleges that salesmen
supplied by the companies who were
selling meat door-to-door failed togive
buyers the legally required notice that
they had three days in which to cancel
their purchases and have them re
turned.
Labeling violations
The motion also cites labeling viola
tions by Arrow and Blue Star, who al

legedly failed to place the correct
weight in a conspicuous place on their
merchandise and to include the ad
dress of the companies.
The motion alleges that false state
ments were made by the salesmen. Af
fidavits said the salesmen claimed
they were "delivery" men and had
steaks left over from a recent delivery
which they would sell at wholesale
prices.
I.emoine. however, told the Daily in
an interview last month that the com
panies engage exclusively in door-to
door sales
I.emoine. three office managers and
10 salesmen have been named on the
motion.
Buyers said they paid anywhere
from to $fi per pound of steak be
cause the meat was sold by the portion
(by the steak) instead of by weight as is
required by law. The salesmen are also
claimed to have misrepresented the
quality of the steaks by calling them
"restaurant." "prime" and "choice"
cuts, when in fact much of the meat
was ungraded.
Bruno set the preliminary hearing
for March IH. The temporary restrain
ing order requires the salesmen to give
the three-day notice, to use the proper

name of the cut. to refrain from mis
representing the quality of the meat
and refrain from representing them
selves as delivery men.
The companies are also required to
label the price per pound in a con
spicuous place. The order, which was
allegedly violated hy salesmen in
Monterey last Friday, is valid until the
preliminary hearing is over.
Investigation
The actions followed an investiga
tion spurred by several complaints re
ceived by the county department of
consumer affairs. The investigation,
headed by Supervising Inspector
Henry Eales of the Division of Weights
and Measures, began last September,
finally yielding enough evidence to
link the salesmen to the companies.
Because the salesmen are independent
contractors, the meat companies could
conceivably disavow any responsibil
ity for the salesmen's actions. Rut the
existence of a company training prog
ram for the salesmen may link the
companies directly with the allega
tions. according to Eales.
Santa Clara County Dep. Dist. Attv
Michael F'opolizio said his office will
also contend Lemoineis in violation
of a 1973 preliminary injunction.
