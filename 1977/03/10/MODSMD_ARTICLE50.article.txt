# Lagunita Court tries voluntary energy conservation
## 
### Karen Koman 
In the past couple of months,
the cold, hard facts of the energy
problem have finallv come to the
attention of the American
people. OI course, this was only
after the fuel shortage fore ed 24!i
Illinois schools into closing, and
lord. General Motors and
Chrysler had to lay off some
5H.000 workers. Hut then we're
not perfect. . . .
Growing concern about the
energy crisis lias become appa
rent on campus. Organizers of an
Energy Awareness office on
campus have gone to numerous
dorms, urging greater ( observa
tion efforts. Heaters and foun
tains have been turned off. water
pressure lowered, and the food
servi( e is doing its part by cook
ing all the food onlv half-way.
()l .ill the dorms, Lagunita is
making the greatest strides in
s.iv inu energy. Numerous flyers,
which illustrate ,i Ghaplinesque
tigure astride a bicycle, carry the
message: "Lagunita Is Setting
The Pace In The Knergy Race "
And this is < ertainlv true.
According to Karl lohnson ol
the energy office, Lagunita has
( ill its energy use bv tr> per cent
in the past month. This breaks
down to about $I2 to $10 a day.
or $.'11)00 a year
These savings are not the re
sult of stringent, extremist mea
sures on the pari ol Lagunita re
sidents Pre-med red hots are not
huddled over 112 luttered desks,
their straining eves aided only
h\ the light of a lone candle
People have not yet been forced
to set lire to their stacks of
"worthless'' chemistry books in
a futile effort to keep warm.
"The program is purposely
low-key." says Kobbie Robinson.
Resident I el low at Eiu aly pto.
"so that we can instill a lasting
awareness ol the merits of sim
ple conservation efforts. What
we're mainly Irving to do is cut
out the waste "

Some factors that might con
tribute to the lower electricity
used are newly-installed
lower-wattage bulbs in the hall
ways. Energy-saving dimmer
switches have been added to the
light fixtures in Granada, but are
too expensive to be put i 11 all the
houses. However, these innova
tions account for only about 200
to 2fjo of the daily kilowatts
saved. The remaining 300
kilowatts conserved are due en
tirely to student efforts, says
Robinson.
Student reaction has been
generally favorable, though
rather unenthusiastic As one
third-year student stated, "I
think about it. but I don't think
about it."
Sophomore (lurl ( Heaves said.
"Everyone's just been observing
the waste around here, People
have been making a conscious
effort, but not doing anything to
resti it t their normal lifestyle,
like turning off llieii stereo or
waterbed I usual I \ turn off the
shower when I lather up and I've
nolif ed other people doing it
too
Some people credit the myriad
signs and slit kers posted on the
walls, above the sinks, and over
t he toilets with niakjng residents
more aware of the problem
Other people, like kik Walker,
think th.il the R.\s in the dorms
have been the prime movers be
hind the project and have donea
lot to get students interested and
involved
One of I he men in Eu< alypto
suggested coed showers as one
way to save on water. However,
lie admits. "When I take a
shower with my girlfriend, inv
mi nd's sure not on sa vi ng
energy Of her people don t
think that coed showers would
go over very well in Lag. One
male student observed.
"Lagunita is a pretty sterile
house "
Elfie I orbes. a senior .if
Eucaly pto. says that she hasp t
been too aware ol the program

itself. "I think that people are
more conscious of it (energy
conservation) in terms of know
ledge than in regards to their
lifestyle. It really freaks me out
when people say 'Oh, we have
enough coal to last for another
500 years. They're just con
cerned a ho ut today and their
own lives, not about the future.
Here in the house, most people
just try to turn off the lights
when they're not needed." As to
water conservation . . . that's
hard for me to judge. I've never
really noticed other people's
habits in tin* shower."
Donna Armstrong, of Ujamaa.

says that on their side of the
courtyard "energy conservation
is really not any kind of an or
ganized drive. It's mostly just an
individual effort; 1 notice that
people are turning off the lights
in the lounge more frequently.
No one in the house has really
talked about it in meetings or
anything since Karl Johnson
came over and gave a talk about
it a few weeks ago."
Walker echoes these senti
ments. "Everyone's kind of sub
consciously into it You don't go
running around turning off other
people's lights for them."
Robinson is trying to make

more of the students aware of the
"peak period" of the day. bet
ween 4:30 to 8:30 at night when
energy costs are at their highest.
During this interval, electricity
prices are four times Higher than
normal and it takes more fuel for
t he utility com pa nies to run their
generators. "It would really help
if students would try to cut down
on their use of major electrical
appliances like washers and
dryers during this time." he
says.
The program has paid off in
terms of money saved and
energy conserved. According to
Robinson, the savings are due to

"a few people in each of the
dorms who make a real effort.
Granada seems to be the most en
thusiastic of the dorms involved,
but it's hard to tell which dorm is
saving the most, si nee there is no
differentiation between the vari
ous dorms on the power meter
In general, people are more
aware of the waste, hut nobody
has made any real sacrifit es
yet."
Eor the University as a whole,
energy has begun to take a siza
ble chunk out ot the annual
operating fee. I ,ast year. Stanford
paid $2.H0 million (six per cent
of the budget) in energy costs.

This year's cost projection is es
timated at $4.1 million, a hike ot
27 per cent, according to
Johnson. "Those figures are not
due just to inflation." says
Johnson. "Energy prices are
soaring astronomically, they've
reached their own special level.
Natural gas prices alone have in
creased by 7 5 per cent from last
year."
If more concentrated measures
are not taken to conserve energy
on campus, he estimates that
energy costs will eat into Stan
ford's operating budget consid
erably. possibly consuming up
to 19 per cent of it.

Elfie I orbes. a senior .if

been too aware ol the program

itself. "I think that people are
more conscious of it (energy
conservation) in terms of know

when people say 'Oh, we have
enough coal to last for another
500 years. They're just con
cerned a ho ut today and their
own lives, not about the future.
Here in the house, most people
just try to turn off the lights
when they're not needed." As to
water conservation . . . that's
hard for me to judge. I've never
really noticed other people's
habits in tin* shower."
Donna Armstrong, of Ujamaa.

says that on their side of the
courtyard "energy conservation
is really not any kind of an or
ganized drive. It's mostly just an
individual effort; 1 notice that
people are turning off the lights
in the lounge more frequently.
No one in the house has really
talked about it in meetings or
anything since Karl Johnson
came over and gave a talk about
it a few weeks ago."
Walker echoes these senti

running around turning off other
people's lights for them."
Robinson is trying to make

more of the students aware of the
"peak period" of the day. bet
ween 4:30 to 8:30 at night when
energy costs are at their highest.
During this interval, electricity
prices are four times Higher than
normal and it takes more fuel for
t he utility com pa nies to run their
generators. "It would really help
if students would try to cut down
on their use of major electrical
appliances like washers and
dryers during this time." he
says.
The program has paid off in
terms of money saved and
energy conserved. According to
Robinson, the savings are due to

"a few people in each of the
dorms who make a real effort.
Granada seems to be the most en
thusiastic of the dorms involved,
but it's hard to tell which dorm is
saving the most, si nee there is no
differentiation between the vari
ous dorms on the power meter
In general, people are more
aware of the waste, hut nobody
has made any real sacrifit es
yet."
Eor the University as a whole,
energy has begun to take a siza
ble chunk out ot the annual
operating fee. I ,ast year. Stanford
paid $2.H0 million (six per cent
of the budget) in energy costs.

This year's cost projection is es
timated at $4.1 million, a hike ot
27 per cent, according to
Johnson. "Those figures are not
due just to inflation." says
Johnson. "Energy prices are
soaring astronomically, they've
reached their own special level.
Natural gas prices alone have in
creased by 7 5 per cent from last
year."
If more concentrated measures
are not taken to conserve energy
on campus, he estimates that
energy costs will eat into Stan
ford's operating budget consid
erably. possibly consuming up
to 19 per cent of it.
In the past couple of months,
the cold, hard facts of the energy

Eor the University as a whole,

27 per cent, according to
Johnson. "Those figures are not
