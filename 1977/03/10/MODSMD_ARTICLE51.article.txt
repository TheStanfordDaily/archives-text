# 497-1411: information, day and night
## 
### Laura Ost 
When you're still wracking
your brains at 4 a.m. this
weekend, feeling like the only
earthling alive at Stanford, rest
assured t hat you're not. There's a
big shack over behind the fire
station that looks from the out
side even more like army bar
racks than your dorm does.
People work there 24 hours a day
all year long — not just during
dead week. Nof only that, the
phones ring .ill the time.
Telecom iiiu n icat ions has
existed since April 197.L when
the University direct-dial tele
phone system was established.
Galled Gentrex, the system in
cludes all campus numbers with
a 497 prefix. From any such
phone you can reach another
Gentrex extension by dialing "7"
plus the last four digits.
The operators at telecom
munications answer the ('entrex
information number. 497-1411.
The number is primarily used by
academic departments and the
Stanford hospital because no
one else seems to know it.
Gallers can request numbers
for students, dorm pay phones
and staff and faculty homes and
offices. And you don't have to

endure that taped "II you've
checked your directory. .
The operators also otter mis
cellaneous information on cam
pus events and game scores, al
though Tresidder provides
much of the same information on
a daily events tape recording at
497-:iHHO.
"We do not give out any
academic information at any
time." emphasized Edna Barnes,
the operations supervisor.
"That's the registrar's office."
Telecommunications is true to
the operator stereotypy. All of
the supervisors are women, as
are most of the Hi full-time stall
and 20 students working part
time for financial aid.
"Nobody ever talks ahout the
poor male operators: how many
'Yes. mams' we get." said Matt
Messner. a student operator.
Most of tht l activity goes on in
a large square room decorated
with a huge poster of a palm
tree-lined beach. The air is til
led with the whirring machina
tions <>l various computers.
Operators sit ,it eight desks, each
with a multi-buttoned phone
that makes vour (IB look simple,
and a circular file called a RANI)
that makes your student direc
tory look like a misprint.
Barnes estimated that 407-
2.100. the Stanford information
number listed in the telephone
directory. re< eives an average ol
41100 calls every 24 hours, while
4 47-14 1 1 gets about UK) during a
day shift.
It yourde.id week misfortunes
should include being trapped in
an elevator, never tear, call tele
communications. The phones in
those steel cubicles can't reach
the outside world, but 7-1011

will get you a telecommunica
tions operator.
Most of the people who call
information have routine quesi
tons. Ginna Stacey commented
that "almost all of the students
who call are very polite and very
patient." Another worker said
that doctors are the "most impa
tient." Callers are encouraged to
dial directlv. although the
openWors can connect them di
rectly.
Some of the calls, however,
make your obscene phone calls
seem dull.
"There are some funny ones
I'd love to tell you. but not it
you'regoing to print it." laughed
Stacey. "But sometimes people
call up and say 'Gimme )oe.'
We'll ask. Is he a student or
what?' T hev'll say. 'Well. I don't
know. . .' "
Night supervisor Dola West
recalled many parents phoning,
worried about their freshmen
offspring.
"One time we had a woman
call in and say. 'I've just been
kidnaped. They have me in this
little room and it's dark and I
can't see the phone." " offered
Molly Glaspell The woman
turned out to be a confused hos
pital patient, not a student dying
a dead week death.
One of the stranger calls oc
curred .is this reporter was leav
ing telecommunications. Floyd
l-'ickle waved furiously from his
desk in the corner.
"I have someone here who
wants to know if Dave Ansley
still writes articles tor the
Daily." he called.
They get calls about everv
thing over t here

Operators are on duty 24 hours a day in what looks like a country
