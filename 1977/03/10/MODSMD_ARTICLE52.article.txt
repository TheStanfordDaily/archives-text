Kicking ntl a 28-city national
tour. Fleetwood Mac was re
ceived with resounding en
thusiasm dt a recent Berkeley
concert. Headlining the even
ing's performance were numen
(itis selections from their latest
release. Humours, as well as older
favorites such as "Rhiannon"
and "Hypnotized."
The ( oncert. a benefit for the
Berkeley < hapter of the(lousteau
Society, was preceded by a short
Gousteau film entitled "The
Might ot the Penguin." This
choice reflected Fleetwood
Mai s unusual fixation with this
nativeot colder climes. Indeed, a
six-foot penguin was on hand to
mingle with members of the au
dience. Although unavailable
for comment, he appeared to
enjov the affair as fully as the rest
of the crowd.

But for the inclusion in con
certs of "Oh Well" and "Green
Manalishi." Fleetwood Mac
today ignores a 60s incarnation

as an English blues-oriented
band fronted by Peter Green,
perhaps the greatest white blues
guitarist ever. Only drummer
Mick Fleetwood and bassist John
McVie remain from the original
ensemble. For years the nucleus
of the band, which came to in
elude Ghristine Perfect (now
McVie) playing keyboards and
singing, underwent changes of
personnel and sound until
Stevie Nicks and l.indsey Buc
kingham joined up for the three
million-seller Fleetwood Mac,
released in 1975.
Success bucks change.
Humours betrays a surprising
conservatism in that it is virtu
ally indistinguishable from the
last album in content and pro
duction. Humours does bear
more obvious marks of blatant
commercialism. Kvery track is
catchy enough to warrant AM
airplay. Vocals are emphasized
in spite of unremarkable lyrics

because of the attractive vocal
qualities of Christine McVi<>,
Buckingham .mil Nic ks.
FM stalwarts will complain
that the perpetually solid
rhythm section. Fleetwood and
John McYie, is held in < he< k.
And Buckingham's guitar solos,
while clean and appenliug. ,ire
rather tame. Yet "Second Hand
News," "(jo Your Own Way,"
and "Cold Dust Woman" the
latter like Nicks Rhiannon."
even to the frenzied finish
stand out as automatic hits
The (|ii ietei numbers break the
pace and supply personal senti
mentality. "Songbird" features
Christine at her most tender as
both singer and pianist.
The remaining five cuts are
also aural treats The only disap
pointment about Humours is
that it so resembles its im
mediate predecessor.
Rumours is available at the Stan
ford Bookstore for $4.79.
