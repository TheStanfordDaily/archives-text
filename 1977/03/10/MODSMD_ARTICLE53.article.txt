## John Hartford, 150 years late 
### 
Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Won
der, and John Hartford. What do
thev all have in common? They
were all winners at The Grammy
Awards in Hollywood a couple
of weeks ago.
Hartford won two Grammies
in iy(iH for "Gentle on My
Mind," and this year won the
Grammy for the Best Traditional
and Ethnic Album for his Mark
Twang
While this year's awards were
being presented, Hartford was
performing to packed houses at
San Francisco's Great American
Music Hall. Between shows we
had the opportunity to talk with
the man who has been charac
terized as 'The greatest living
preserver ol American tradi
tional music."
Born in New York Gitv and
raised in Clayton, Missouri, he
grew up hanging around steam
bo.its and playing fiddle and
banjo lor local square dances. In
his high school yearbook it was
said of him that "when he isn't
making music with the
Kidgerunners. he can probably
be found talking with some ol
his steamboat friends
downtown."
Trained as a commercial artist
at Washington University in St.
Louis, he had held many jobs
Mississippi riverboat deckhand,
disc jockey, and commercial ar
tist — before being discovered in
a Nashville studio by Tommy
Smothers. Smothers brought
him to L.A. in 1968 as a regular
011 the network hit "The Glen
Gamphell Goodfime Hour." By
this time he had already written
"Gentle on My Mind" and had
recorded his first album, which
marked him as a rising songwrit
ing talent.
His reputation was made as a
pot t who constructed elaborate
and sensitive images of love and
life. With a banjo.
He has played with such nota
ble as Vassar Clements, The Dil
lards. Earl Scruggs, Norman
Blake, and Mason Williams. He
has been a featured performer at
major American and European
bluegrass festivals. The influ
ence of Hartford's brand of up
beat bluegrass can be seen on
such albums as Old and in the
Way bv ferry Garcia, which tea

tures a number of Hartford's
cronies.
Hartford, if nothing else, is
modest and unpretentious. He
ambles on stage, practically un
noticed, carrying his own in
struments.
But as he launches into a set
which is in many ways outrage
ous, eccentric, and downright
wierd. you realize that there are
not many people who could
carry it off without Hartford's
brand of deadpan wit and style.
Playing alone, singing and ac-

companying himself on fiddle,
banjo and guitar, Hartford sings
serious love songs, observations
on urban living, odes to his
girlfriend's breasts ("The Gol
den Globe Award"), warped
discs ("Don't Leave Your Re
cords in the Sun"), youth cul
ture ("Granny Wontcha STioke
Some Marijuana" and "Boo
gie"), and lots of ripsnortin'
bluegrass.
Increased humor
Over the years Hartford's act
has changed. Audiences have
responded enthusiastically to
his increased use of bluegrass
and humor. In line with his artis
tic background, he views the
meanderings of his career with
the eye of an individualist.
His lifelong fascination with
steamboats, like his artistic
training, frames his outlook on
her career. "It's like people who
work on boats. The one view
they don't have is what everyone
has. the outside of their own
boat. Retired boatmen collect
pictures of boats. They're too in

volved with (heir own boat to
know what it looks like. As for
my career, I can't comment on it.
That's for the critics to do."*"
I started nut to be a towboat
ma n
But I couldn't get the hund of
a ratchet-bar . . .
"Steamboat Whistle Blues"
"That's what I wanted to be in
life — a steamboat operator. But
the towboat I started out on was
too macho a scene — a lot of tat
toos. They read comic books. I
was too artsy-craftsy for it, so I
got out." But just as he's gotten
back tobluegrass, Hartford's also
returned to the river. "I just got
my operator's license," he said
proudly. He recited the schedule
of his twice-yearly excursion
down the Mississippi.
As with most of his albums,
Hartford designed the cover for
Mark Twang. It features a water
color painting of a steamboat he
happened to come across one
day. He liked it because it re
minded him of his favorite time
on the river: "When the sun
comes up and burns off the
clouds hut there's still a light
mist settled on the water. That's
the feeling I like best."
'Word movies'
Hartford's conception of the
use of imagery in his songs led
him to characterize them as
"Word Movies." (His book by
the same title was published by
Doubledav in 1971.) "Ancient
primitive people started using
words originally to take the
place of pictures. That's what
writing is. You replacethevisual
images with words. All writers
think in terms of images — that's
the whole idea."
It's a fact, as Hartford put it,
that "traditional and country
music is bigger than ever." The
country-tinged sound of groups
such as the Eagles reflects this.
It's ironic that Hartford, as one of
the leaders of the trend, thinks
his own reverence for the C.iand
Ole Opry tradition is somewhat
rooted in nostalgia. He yearns
romantically for the frontier
days of Mark Twain, steamboats,
and King Cotton. "If everyone
was like me there'd be no prog
ress at all ... I was born aboi.t
150 years too late."
