## Founders' Day concert 
### 
Memorial Church, with its aura of cool grand
eur, was filled to overflowing Sunday afternoon
for the "Concert in Honor of Founders' Day,"
featuring the Stanford Symphony, the Stanford
Chorus and University Organist Herbert Nanney.
The concert began with Handel's Organ Con
certo in F Major (No. 4 of 1738 I believe, although
the program didn't say). While exhibiting his
usual flawless technique, Nanney also showed
deep insight into the work's secular nature. Resist
ing the temptation to indulge in an overly grand
rendition, Nanney acknowledged its non-religious
origins through his light, harpsichord-like in
terpretation.
The Stanford Orchestra, under the tight baton of
Mark Starr, performed with good dynamics and
only minor intonation problems. Due to the or
chestra's position in the organ loft, acoustical dis
tortions were minimized.
The bulk of the audience, there more because
they were alumni than from any love of music, did
not realize when the work was over, while those
who did recognize it were evidently observing the
old European custom of not applauding tor in
church peformances (a custom which, for aesthetic
reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse). Hence, a de
lightful 15-second pause proceededtheapplause.
The Magnificat of C.P.E. Bach, a religious work
for chorus, soloists and orchestra, was written in
1749, one year befor the death of his prolific father.
The younger Bach is often thought of as a transi
tion between Johann Sebastian and Haydn; this
dichotomy between the learned manner and the
light Classic style is found in the Magnificat.
Confidence
I have been attending Stanford Chorus concerts
for two years now, and I have never seen them si ng
with more confidence, better technique, or more
importantly, a closer attention to phrasing and
emotion.

From the ecstatic Gloria Patri to the plaintive Et
Misericordia, the singers successfully communi
cated a wide range of emotions. Much of the credit
for this belongs to Director William Ramsey,
whose knowing hand could be seen in the sensi
tive phrasing and dynamics that made effective
musical expression possible.
The vocal soloists were also among the best I
have witnessed at Stanford. Soprano Nancy Wait,
soloist with the church choir, had a lovely and
exceptionally refined tone — a light and airy
timbre.
Imported soloists
Two of the soloists were imported from ouside
the community. Tenor Gene Albin, a local semi
professional, didn't exhibit a powerful delivery,
but his timbre was amazingly even throughout his
range, and he negotiated the difficult tenor part
with ease. Alto Stephanie Freedman, a Berkeley
semi-professional, had the most mature voice of
the four. With abundant reserves of power and
warmth, she easily filled the church with sound.
The orchestra did not fare so well. Intonation
problems were persistent and universal, suggest
ing a paucity of rehearsal time, perhaps due to
their recent difficult success with the
Shostakovich/Beethoven program.
Although the orchestra responded quickly to
dynamic or phrasing gestures used by conductor
Ramsey, such signals were few and far between,
leading to a somewhat listless orchestral rendi
tion. Ramsey must be complimented, however, on
his excellent direction of the chorus and his gen
eral understanding of the Rococo style.
The Magnificat was a success — one of the better
music department performances I've seen at Stan
ford — and from the enthusiastic response and the
pleasant comments afterwards, I guess that the
Founders would have been pleased.

tion between Johann Sebastian and Haydn; this
dichotomy between the learned manner and the
light Classic style is found in the Magnificat.
Confidence
I have been attending Stanford Chorus concerts
for two years now, and I have never seen them si ng
with more confidence, better technique, or more
importantly, a closer attention to phrasing and
emotion.

From the ecstatic Gloria Patri to the plaintive Et
Misericordia, the singers successfully communi
cated a wide range of emotions. Much of the credit
for this belongs to Director William Ramsey,
whose knowing hand could be seen in the sensi
tive phrasing and dynamics that made effective
musical expression possible.
The vocal soloists were also among the best I
have witnessed at Stanford. Soprano Nancy Wait,
soloist with the church choir, had a lovely and
exceptionally refined tone — a light and airy
timbre.
Imported soloists
Two of the soloists were imported from ouside
the community. Tenor Gene Albin, a local semi
professional, didn't exhibit a powerful delivery,
but his timbre was amazingly even throughout his
range, and he negotiated the difficult tenor part
with ease. Alto Stephanie Freedman, a Berkeley
semi-professional, had the most mature voice of
the four. With abundant reserves of power and
warmth, she easily filled the church with sound.
The orchestra did not fare so well. Intonation
problems were persistent and universal, suggest
ing a paucity of rehearsal time, perhaps due to
their recent difficult success with the
Shostakovich/Beethoven program.
Although the orchestra responded quickly to
dynamic or phrasing gestures used by conductor
Ramsey, such signals were few and far between,
leading to a somewhat listless orchestral rendi
tion. Ramsey must be complimented, however, on
his excellent direction of the chorus and his gen
eral understanding of the Rococo style.
The Magnificat was a success — one of the better
music department performances I've seen at Stan
ford — and from the enthusiastic response and the
pleasant comments afterwards, I guess that the
Founders would have been pleased.
Memorial Church, with its aura of cool grand
eur, was filled to overflowing Sunday afternoon
for the "Concert in Honor of Founders' Day,"
featuring the Stanford Symphony, the Stanford
Chorus and University Organist Herbert Nanney.
The concert began with Handel's Organ Con
certo in F Major (No. 4 of 1738 I believe, although
the program didn't say). While exhibiting his
usual flawless technique, Nanney also showed
deep insight into the work's secular nature. Resist
ing the temptation to indulge in an overly grand
rendition, Nanney acknowledged its non-religious
origins through his light, harpsichord-like in
terpretation.
The Stanford Orchestra, under the tight baton of
Mark Starr, performed with good dynamics and
only minor intonation problems. Due to the or
chestra's position in the organ loft, acoustical dis
tortions were minimized.
The bulk of the audience, there more because
they were alumni than from any love of music, did
not realize when the work was over, while those
who did recognize it were evidently observing the
old European custom of not applauding tor in
church peformances (a custom which, for aesthetic
reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse). Hence, a de
lightful 15-second pause proceededtheapplause.
The Magnificat of C.P.E. Bach, a religious work
for chorus, soloists and orchestra, was written in
1749, one year befor the death of his prolific father.
The younger Bach is often thought of as a transi
tion between Johann Sebastian and Haydn; this
dichotomy between the learned manner and the
light Classic style is found in the Magnificat.
