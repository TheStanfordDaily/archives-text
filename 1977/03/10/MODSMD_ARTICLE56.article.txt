The current stage production
of Moliere'sThe Bourgeois Gent
leman at San Francisco's Ameri
can Conservatory Theatre is bil
led light entertainment as per
formed before the Court of the
Sun King, Louis XIV; this pro
duction is indeed very light as
entertainment.
Director William Ball had a
difficult time deciding whether
he was producing a farce or a
situation comedy. The players
interact neither strongly nor
sensitively. When they play di
rectly to the audience, they lack
enthusiasm.
The play concerns a trades
man, Monsieur Jourdain
(Charles Hallahan) who vainly
attempts to transform himself
into a gentleman of the day.
He surrounds himself with
musicians, dancers and a
philosopher to teach him the
ways of nobility. So enthralled is
he with his pursuit that he will
not allow his daughter to marry a
commoner and nearly loses his
wife because of it.
Director Ball creates a merry
go-round on stage that has the
audience literally dizzy by the
end of the show. At the first sign
of hysteria (a frequent occurr
ence) the actors begin rushing
around in a large circle. So often
does this happen that some au
dience members try to cash in
their winning tickets on "Jour

dai n in the 112 irst" at intermission,
only to find they have come to
the wrong track.
Moliere's plays rely more
heavily on characterization than
plot. And so the play relies on
Monsieur )ourdain and Count
Durante (Earl Boen), the only
two actors approaching charac
terization.
Boen was excellent in his role
as the sly, back-biting con man
who, by virtue of his nobility, is
able to borrow large sums of
money from Jourdain, who
wishes to befriend him. Halla
han as Jourdain is good, but not
impressive. He is reminiscent of
the slapstick comedy of the
Three Stooges, but he fails to
capture Moliere's high comedy.
Madame Jourdain is, at best,
trite in her portrayal of an over
bearing wife. Besides Count
Dorante, the chorus highlights
the performance with some
well-executed choreography
and music, giving the play a
Vaudevillian flavor.
The impression one gets is
that the stage carpenters simply
refused to complete the set be
cause of some last minute labor
dispute. The set was done in un
finished wood — on purpose, I
am told — to capture the main
character as he is building his
house. But the set, alas, may do a
better job in its role than the
actor does in his.

enthusiasm.
The play concerns a trades
man, Monsieur Jourdain
(Charles Hallahan) who vainly
attempts to transform himself
into a gentleman of the day.
He surrounds himself with
musicians, dancers and a
philosopher to teach him the
ways of nobility. So enthralled is
he with his pursuit that he will
not allow his daughter to marry a
commoner and nearly loses his
wife because of it.
Director Ball creates a merry
go-round on stage that has the
audience literally dizzy by the
end of the show. At the first sign
of hysteria (a frequent occurr
ence) the actors begin rushing
around in a large circle. So often
does this happen that some au
dience members try to cash in
their winning tickets on "Jour

dai n in the 112 irst" at intermission,
only to find they have come to
the wrong track.
Moliere's plays rely more
heavily on characterization than
plot. And so the play relies on
Monsieur )ourdain and Count
Durante (Earl Boen), the only
two actors approaching charac
terization.
Boen was excellent in his role
as the sly, back-biting con man
who, by virtue of his nobility, is
able to borrow large sums of
money from Jourdain, who
wishes to befriend him. Halla
han as Jourdain is good, but not
impressive. He is reminiscent of
the slapstick comedy of the
Three Stooges, but he fails to
capture Moliere's high comedy.
Madame Jourdain is, at best,
trite in her portrayal of an over
bearing wife. Besides Count
Dorante, the chorus highlights
the performance with some
well-executed choreography
and music, giving the play a
Vaudevillian flavor.
The impression one gets is
that the stage carpenters simply
refused to complete the set be
cause of some last minute labor
dispute. The set was done in un
finished wood — on purpose, I
am told — to capture the main
character as he is building his
house. But the set, alas, may do a
better job in its role than the
actor does in his.
