## Astounding variety at ABT 
### 
American Ballet Theater's al
most bizarrely eclectic repertory
astounds; its program Satur
day night at Xellerbach Au
ditorium in Berkeley was so var
ied, I came out confused by the
juxtaposition of four quite diffe
rent pieces and dazzled by the
dancers' inexhaustible
chameleon-like abilities.
Two works, Fancy Free and
Pillar of Fire, celebrate ABT's
choreographic heyday of the
early '40s; another, the pas de
deux from Le Corsoire shows off
19th century virtuosity; the
fourth, Pust 1 Comes to Shove,
displays contemporary indigen
ous creativity.
Fancy Five is the result of a
collaboration between Leonard
Bernstein, who wrote the music
for West Side Story and Jerome
Kobbins, who choreographed
the movie. Fancy Free was first
performed in 1944. It's about
three carefree sailors on shore
leave in a big city; they pick up
two girls in a bar. display their
individuality through dancing
— one is an extrovert, the second
a romanticist, the third a "Don
Juan." The fun lies in their un
self-conscious exuberance and
innocent sexuality, spelled out

by Robbins' accurately native
movement. It could become
stale, but John Prinz, Charles
Maple and Terry Orr as the three
sailors dance with a brash im
mediacy that keeps Fancy Free
from descending the depths of
stereotypical Americana.
Serious situation
Pillar of Fire was one of the
first ballets to employ a serious
dramatic situation as the pretext
for a ballet; Anthony Tudor ar
rived from Britain in 19:19 and
choreographed it for ABT in
1942. He literally portrays inner
states of mind and feeling
through phrase-like, sometimes
abrupt interaction of movement.
Pillar of Fire is set in a small
town in 1900 and concerns a
young woman, Hagar, as she
deals with her sexual frustration
and the possessive hypocrisy of
her family. Sallie YVilson has
long owned the role of Hagar;
after several Pillar of Fires, what
I notice now is not so much
Hagar's present anguish but
Wilson's great imagination,
which provokes a state of vul
nerability that induces her tur
moil.
The "Crand Pas de Deux"

from Don Quixote was prom
ised, but Marianna Tcherkassky
and Charles Ward danced the
vituosic pas de deux from Le
Corsair instead. It dates from
1856 when it was first performed
in the Paris Opera.
Demure luminosity
Tcherkassky's demure
luminosity is perfect for the
young princess of Corsaire: her
technique is quite good (sub
stituting an attitude turn for
every fourth fouette), but she
doesn't use her heels consis
tently in releves. If she did,
perhaps her legs would not be so
thick and thus mar her overall
line.
Charles Ward's jumps may not
be superhumanly suspended,
but his innocent heroism and
unpretentious command quite
took my breath away. Together,
Tcherkassky and Ward, only re
cently ranked as principals,
make us feel the intrinsic ex
citement of the steps and their
original raison d'etre.
Twyla Tharp
Twyla Tharp went to Barnard
a decade ago and then formed
her own company as choreog
rapher. Her style theatricalizes
and extends her typically
American dance training of tap,
ballet, jazz, acrobatics and baton.
Her approach to the steps of
Push Comes to Shove and to the
music, Joseph Lamb's Bohemia
Hag 1919 and Haydn's Sym
phony No. 82, is quite seriously
classic in intent, though; every
thing is planned, ordered and
fits into a cohesive integer.
Kirk Peterson took over the
lead male role choreographed
for Baryshnikov, but his out
rageous hamming lost Tharp's
20th century objectivity.
Tcherkassky, Martine Van
Hamel, and Kristine Elliott have
strong enough presences to
submerge themselves and let the
movement speak for itself with
out getting buried. The audience
guffawed throughout; aside
from the few intentional gags, it
was mostly due to the unfamil
iarity of Tharp's head rollings,
shoulder wriggles, and other
unorthodox movements, espe
cially seen in contrast with the
rest of the program.
