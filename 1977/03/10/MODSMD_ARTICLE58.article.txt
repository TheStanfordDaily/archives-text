It's everything you've always wanted: the
sets are by Andrew Wyeth. the score is by
Woody Guthrie, the acting is superb and it
addresses the problems of the people. For
those of you who feel the need for relevance,
who identity with the poor, the hungry and
the downtrodden but find no outlet, this is
the movie for you. And let me say in passing
that this revolution is respectable for once:
the communists are dressed as unionizers.
and violence is obviously the result of the
exploiters trying to protect their interests.
Do you know that glow when a great idea
is just being born, when the people around
you are turning on and the problems are
challenges and the vision is a fire and its us
against them and foronce itsall worthwhile?
That is the moment Bound For Glory cap
tures.
Overtly, the setting of the movie is the
Dust Bowl-to-California migration of
thousands of people. Steinbeck immor
tal ized its negative aspects. Now imagine the
Steinbeck libretto made into an American

Folk Opera, celebrating life despite the de
pression, the exploitation, the misery. Put in
background music by Woody (>nthrie and
have David Carradine portray Woody's folk
humor and indefeatable optimism with
complete integrity. Have Hal Ashby photo
graph the whole with still shots that could
have been painted by Wyeth and moving
shots that actually capture the essence of t he
nomadic experience — the endless roads,
the barren nights, the relentless trains.
Now you have the revolutionary spirit
safely romanticized, softened. The people
suffer cheerfully, the villains are unambigu
ous and the common cause gives birth to the
genre of the protest song. And protest songs,
essentially, are what Bound For Glory really
is about.
A press release from United Artists, "Pro
test Through Music." maintains that "As
exemplified by the work of Hob Dylan. Pete
Seeger and Woody (luthrie, 20th century pro
test songs are regarded as a prime example of
art stirring people to action and reflecting
the social and political unrest of a given
period."
There can be no contention that protest
songs reflect "the social and political unrest
of a given period" — it is tautological. Hut it
is questionable whether "art stirring people
to action" is a meaningful concept.
Songs of protest,when successful, pro

duce enthusiastic mobs. Such movements
rarely cause a change in the social structure.j
no matter how much they enjoy the confron
tation. Protest songs bolster the self-image of
the group in a way that is almost paradoxi
cal: if the problem was to be solved, the
momentum of the enthusiasm would be
finished. And. since good causes are hard to
find, many talented protesters would be un
employed. In fact, songs of protest affected*"
the socialist/revolutionaries in much the
same way as Bound For Glory affects us: an
ideali/ed version of legimitate problems
presented with an irresistable flair, stimulat*
ing us to believe it is still possible to bancs
together and overcome the enemy.
Guthrie is an exploiter of life itself, an in
satiable, creative, vital, nomadic folk-arti'sl

songs. The tradition was enriched by

It's everything you've always wanted: the
sets are by Andrew Wyeth. the score is by
Woody Guthrie, the acting is superb and it
addresses the problems of the people. For
those of you who feel the need for relevance,
who identity with the poor, the hungry and
the downtrodden but find no outlet, this is
the movie for you. And let me say in passing
that this revolution is respectable for once:
the communists are dressed as unionizers.
and violence is obviously the result of the
exploiters trying to protect their interests.
Do you know that glow when a great idea
is just being born, when the people around
you are turning on and the problems are
challenges and the vision is a fire and its us
against them and foronce itsall worthwhile?
That is the moment Bound For Glory cap
tures.
Overtly, the setting of the movie is the
Dust Bowl-to-California migration of
thousands of people. Steinbeck immor
tal ized its negative aspects. Now imagine the
Steinbeck libretto made into an American

Folk Opera, celebrating life despite the de
pression, the exploitation, the misery. Put in
background music by Woody (>nthrie and
have David Carradine portray Woody's folk
humor and indefeatable optimism with
complete integrity. Have Hal Ashby photo
graph the whole with still shots that could
have been painted by Wyeth and moving
shots that actually capture the essence of t he
nomadic experience — the endless roads,
the barren nights, the relentless trains.
Now you have the revolutionary spirit
safely romanticized, softened. The people
suffer cheerfully, the villains are unambigu
ous and the common cause gives birth to the
genre of the protest song. And protest songs,
essentially, are what Bound For Glory really
is about.
A press release from United Artists, "Pro
test Through Music." maintains that "As
exemplified by the work of Hob Dylan. Pete
Seeger and Woody (luthrie, 20th century pro
test songs are regarded as a prime example of
art stirring people to action and reflecting
the social and political unrest of a given
period."
There can be no contention that protest
songs reflect "the social and political unrest
of a given period" — it is tautological. Hut it
is questionable whether "art stirring people
to action" is a meaningful concept.
Songs of protest,when successful, pro

duce enthusiastic mobs. Such movements
rarely cause a change in the social structure.j
no matter how much they enjoy the confron
tation. Protest songs bolster the self-image of
the group in a way that is almost paradoxi
cal: if the problem was to be solved, the
momentum of the enthusiasm would be

ideali/ed version of legimitate problems
