## De Waart offers balance 
### 
Edo de Waart, the new San Francisco Symphony
director, has promised balanced programs — Clas
sic, Romantic and Modern — and lest Wednes
day's performance was a sterling example.
Haydn's Symphony No. HH, Brown's Cross Sec
tions and Color Fields and the Pin no Concerto No.
i by Rachmaninoff provided an exciting evening
and highlighted De Waart's multi-faceted talent.
Earle Brown, a member of the important "New
York" school of the 19505, is best known tor his
technical innovations in notation and his interest
in the sensuous beauty of sound itself. Cross Sec
tion and Color Fields, a recent composition by
Brown, is in many ways a reaction against the
cacophonous quality of many modern composi
tions. Long sustained chords are combined with
slowly wandering harmonies, while a vast assort
ment of sounds, developed with restraint, are scat
tered above this base.
De Waart adapted well to the unusual con
ducting style needed in this work, described by
Brown as being like a painter in front of a canvas.
De Waart, who has voiced a strong commitment to
modern American compositions, employed ex
tremely visual and unsubtle motions to communi
cate to the orchestra, which responded with a.
technically adequate but not particularly spirited
rendition.
Clear highlight
Haydn's Symphony No. f)H was clearly the high
light of the evening. In his interpretation of Beet
hovens Ninth two weeks ago it became clear that De
Waart is an exactingly precise conductor tending
toward the Classic rather than the Romantic. His
performances have a tightness that Ozawa never
obtained, despite the latter's considerable abilities
in other directions. De Waart's attributes are per
fectly suited to the music of Haydn and Mozart and
were exemplified in a superb performance of
Haydn's Symphony No. 88.
There are those who hole! that all 106 Haydn
symphonies sound alike — the Symphony No. 88
proves them wrong. Utilizing every musical de
vice in his repertory and especially emphasizing
counterpoint, he created a masterpiece — one of
the few Haydn symphonies to rank with the late
Mozart symphonies, TheLurgo second movement,
an imaginative set of strophic variations, inspired
Brahms to exclaim. "1 hope my Ninth Symphony
sounds like that!"
De Waart's tempi were faster than most, lending
a sharp and lively spirit to the work. Since the new
director has taken over the podium, the once
anemic and feeble violins have sounded deep and
rich. Hence, this interpretation sounded quite vio
liny, like some of the old Ansermet recordings.
The tight phrasing and crisp sensitive dynamics
were perfect. However, the horns and trumpets.

which Haydn judiciously saves for the powerful
Largo, played with their habitual imprecision.
The last two movements were done in a novel
and quite effective manner: De Waart held the
strings to a piano and emphasized the woodwind
obbligati. Resisting the temptation to barge ag
gressively into the last movement, he brought the
orchestra to a fortissimo only toward the end. It
was perhaps not quite what Haydn would have
wanted (the movement is specifically marked Al
legro con spirito), but it was a pleasant and im
aginative innovation.
Critics have always been lukewarm toward
Rachmaninoff's Piuno Concerto No. 3. Rhythmi
cally and harmonically, it is somewhat monoton
ous; despite pretentions toward a victorious finale,
it is emotionally one-dimensional and also vague
in form and development. Far less original than its
immediate predecessor inC minor, the only unique
aspect is a brilliant waltz-like passage between the
second and third movements.
Despite these drawbacks, which may seem pro
hibitive, it is a noble and rewarding work. The
Romantic themes and lush harmonies, if devoid of
larger significance, still radiate an irresistable
warmth; the meloncholy mood, making full use of
the pensive quality of D minor, is contagious.
Garrick Ohlsson, the young American winner of
the Chopin Competition, stands 6-feet. 4-inches
and is powerfully built. This initially caused some
balance problems but De Waart reacted quickly,
holding the orchestra to a pianissimothroughout.
Slightly defective
1 couldn't help feeling that the piano was
slightly defective for it sounded strangely muted,
without the incisive high notes and the booming
bass of a normal Steinway grand. At times
Ohlsson's chords rocked the piano and barely
achieved a mezzo-forte sound, and qualitatively,
the timbre wasn't sharp enough.
The tempi were quick, downplaying the overly
Romantic mood of the work, but the performance
was still moving. The orchestra played with deli
cacy and accuracy, matching Ohlsson's interpreta
tion.
The audience responded with an enthusiastic
standing ovation, but in an unusual fashion. Virtu
ally no one in the balconies stood until the entire
orchestra floor was on its feet; a final testament to
Ohlsson's (intentionally or unintentionally) sub
dued style.
Next week, the symphony under De Waart will
present an all-Stravinsky program: Symphony in
Three Movements, Violin Concerto in D, Ragtime
for Eleven Instruments, Symphonies of Wind In
struments, and the "Firebird" Suite. Itzhak
Perlman will be the soloist. Saturday's perfor
mance is at the Flint Center.
