# DNA concern 'silly,' says Nobel laureate
## 
### Bill Snyder Stephen Crolius 
I personally think recombinant
DNA interest is the silliest thing which
has happened to the American nation
since I came back from England in
195.1. Nobel laureate James Watson
said in an interview Saturday.
The Harvard biochemistry profes
sor, in residence here for winter quar
ter. said he felt the controversy about
recombinant DNA research has been
"overplayed."
Critics of the research fear these ex
periments may produce new and viru
lent forms of life which, if they escape
from the laboratory, could cause a
widespread epidemic.
Watson, who in collaboration with
Francis Crick elucidated the double
helical structure of DNA in 1953. said
he regards the possibility of creating
dangerous bacteria as a "Rube
Coldberg scheme."
"These viruses exist, the bacteria is
exposed to their DNA and certainly
pick it up sometimes, and if they were
going to have a selective advantage,
they would have done it,"he said.
As an example. Watson cited a re
port in Science which expressed con
cern that a recombination of E. coli
bacteria DNA and a gene segment
which codes for an enzyme which
breaks down cellulose had created an

organism capable of digesting human
feces and causing diarrhea.
Adaptation unlikely
Successful adaptation of this bac
teria in the human gut is unlikely, said
Watson, because diarrhea would only
cause it to run out the intestines. On
the other hand, "you might learn
something about diarrhea" by making
this bacteria, he said.
Referring to the Cambridge, Mass.
city council's regulation of DNA re
combination experiments conducted
at Harvard and the Massachusetts in
stitute of Technology. Watson said, "I
think it would be a fine thing for any
local community to join in any deci
sion where they can have the facts to
think about.
"But in this case there is no way to
say if it's dangerous and therefore it's
like talking about religion No one has
been able to reassure the opponents."
One attempt to reassure the public
actually backfired.
Recommendations drawn up by sci
entists at the 1975 conference at
Asilomar and subsequently incorpo
rated into the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) guidelines issued last
June, only convinced people of the
danger of recombination, according to
Watson.
'Crying wolf
"Asilomar was crying wolf when
they didn't see a wolf," he said. "Since
you didn't see the wolf but you said
that it might be dangerous, you could
never say it didn't exist."
Watson said that the emphasis of the
regulations on the use of weakened E.
coli strains which are unable to live
outside of the laboratory (so-called
biological containment) only frightens
people, when "there is no reason to
think the ordinary one is unsafe."
Physical containment criteria estab
lished by the regulations are so strict
that they seriously limit the study of
human genes, immunology is one field
that might be set back, said Watson,
because you can't study human anti
body chains.
Current research at the Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory, which Watson di
rects, is centered on "the biology or
structure of t he cancer eel 1." according
to Watson.
Cell 'muscles'
"We're very interested in what you
might call the muscles within the cell.
All cells have their own sort of fibers
which pull parts and make cells move.
"We're interested a great deal in cell
motility both in the cell moving from

one place to another and also just in
changing its shape when it gets around
to mitosis (cell division)."
Watson said cancer researcli is being
restricted by the changing concerns of
society.
"One reason society accepts risks in
research." Watson explained, "is be
cause it feels the research might tell us
something about cancer and this is
what society wants to know; there's a
real reason to do it and we'll take the
risk.
"Now what people are saying is that
it doesn't really matter. This is just
pure science and why not wait a few
years â€” why all this hurry just for
someone to get the Nobel prize?"
