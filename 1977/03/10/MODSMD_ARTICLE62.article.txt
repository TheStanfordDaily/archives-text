Burn! (Queimada.'J. Italy. 1968.
Directed by Gillo Pontecorvo.
"Concerning a small Carri
bean island's struggle for
nationhood while being con
tinually brutalized and
exploited by various colonial
powers. Directed by the same
man who made The Battle of Al
giers, Burn! shares the similar
quality of joining the romantic
notion of passion with the intel
lectual forum of idea. With Mar
lon Brando.
The Harder They Come.
Jamaica, 1973.
Directed by Perry Henzell.
The cult classic about a reggae
musician, Jimmy Cliff, who bat
tles against the commercial bos
ses to get his "fair share" and
winds up a hunted outlaw. The
very well-known soundtrack,
consisting of Cliff and other re
ggae masters, guides us through
various levels of Jamaican cul
ture, stopping periodically to
allow us to appreciate a specific
moment or nuance of the aesthe
tic expression.
Hour Of The Wolf. Sweden.
1968.
Directed by Ingmar Bergman
*Often described as
Bergman's "horror film," it
might be more accurately cap
suled as Bergman's nightmare.
Max Von Sydow is a painter
who lives with his wife, Liv
Ullman, on a small island. The
nightmare begins when he is in
vited to visit a castle, also on the
island, and finds himself in a
world of apparitions and super
natural forces.
Idi Amin Dada: Self-Portrait.
1976.

Directed by Barber Schroeder.
*A documentary about the
Ugandan dictator, filmed with
his consent and assistance.
Perhaps he didn't realize that
what he is so proud of in himself
may not be quite so admired by
the rest of the world.
Love & Anarchy. Italy.
The Seduction O* Mimi. Italy.
Directed by L.ina Wertmuller.
Wertmuller's first two wide
spread releases in this country
prove she deserves every bit of
the reputation which she has
garnered in the last few years as
one of the great filmmakers of
the world. Each of these films
concerns a working-class man
who is drawn into political ac
tivity. The Seduction O/Mimi is
a relatively straight-forward and
immensely witty narrative about
the little man and the big bosses,
about subversion and reversion.
Love & Anarchy is more subjec
tive. delving deeply into a
character and the moods of his
experience. The entire film is
presented visually as a sort of
sepia tapestry, capturing what
very few films have ever done,
an actual texture to the picture.
Both films with Ciancarlo Cian
nini and Mariangelo Melato.
Spirit Of The Beehive. Spain.
1973.
Directed by Victor Erica.
A story about two young sis
ters, and how their viewing of
the Frankenstein affects each of
their individual relationships
with the spiritual world. The
impressively photographed film
casts a very dream-like mood,
portraying the experience and
emotion of the two girls living in
their subjective realities. This
film hits the audience on a level
other than strictly an intellectual
one, allowing us to feel the ex
pression more than think about
it.
