# Bakke reaction continues

### Doug Hyde 
More campus reaction to the Bakke
decision appears to be on the way.
The decision has already prompted
a rally and a teach-in here, and a march
on President Richard Lyman's office.
Now, the University may file an
amicus curiae brief with the U.S. Sup
reme Court and United Stanford
Employees (USE) may issue a state
ment on the case.
In November, the U.S. Supreme
Court will hear an appeal of the
California Supreme Court's Bakke rul
ing, where the state court declared un
constitutional a minority admissions
program at IJC-Davis Medical School.
If the U.S. Supreme Court upholds
the ruling, minority admissions prog
rams at many universities and colleges

could be in danger.
"The Bakkecase, if simply sustained
on the same basis that the California
Supreme Court used, will put us all in
deep trouble." Lyman told de
monstrates outside his office last
month.
Both minority and nonminority stu
dents in the United States have or
ganized into defeat Bakke groups.
Here on campus, concerned students
started the "Coalition Against the
Bakke Decision." Members of the coal
ition maintain that, in the past, public
sympathy has influenced the U.S.
Supreme Court.
Coalition members said they hope
that by showing public opposition,
through such activities as rallies and
teach-ins the U.S. Supreme Court will

overturn the California court's deci
sion.
Activities here have produced reac
tions from the administration. Lyman
agreed at a meeting with 10 students
last month, following the rally, that the
University would consider writing an
amicus curiae brief to file with the
Supreme Court.
The brief, if submitted, will try to
convey to the court the possible ad
verse effects on admissions programs
if the court upheld the state Supreme
Court's decision.
USE voted to have one of its commit
tees look into the case and perhaps
present a position.
The eventual impact of these ac
tivities on the U.S. Supreme Court re
mains unclear.
In addition to the Bakke decision, a
proposed change in undergraduate fi
nancial aid here has drawn campus
reaction.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids voted
5-4 last month to approve a recom
mendation to raise self-help require
ments for next year by $200.
Self-help is the amount students
must pay toward their education. It is
distinct from family contributions and
summer earnings.
The final decision on self-help is
now up to Provost William Miller.
The committee's recommendation
followed a rally of about 00 students
opposed to the measure.
At a meeting with four students Fri
day. Miller said the changeappears "to
be a balanced judgment."
Although Miller said long-term ef
fects of the self-help change are still
"speculation," he has tentatively en
dorsed the recommendation.
