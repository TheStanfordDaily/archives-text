DNA recombination is a process
which scientists have been aware of
and have used for most of the past de
cade.
In essence. DNA recombination in
volves exposing bacteria to certain
types of viruses which can insert their
own genetic material into the DNA
chain of the bacteria instead of multi
plying within and subsequently kil
ling the bacterial cells.
The bacteria can then multiply like
normal, uninfected cells. As they do
so, however, copies of the viral DNA
are passed to the next generation.
The process is useful because the
viral genes eventually come out of
dormancy and cause the production of
new viruses which include segments
of the bacterial DNA in addition to the
genetic material of the original virus.
Upon subsequent infection of other
bacteria by these new viruses, the
bacterial DNA segments carried by the
viruses can be introduced into the
DNA of the newlv-infected bacteria.
When the newly infected bacteria
multiply, their offspring are geneti
cally distinct because of the inclusion
of the "recombinant" DNA from the
original bacteria.
This process of removing genes from
one strain of bacteria and inserting it
into another strain is extremely useful
in establishing the location of indi
vidual genes in relation to other genes.
It has opened up a new field of cancer
research of the type being conducted at
the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
