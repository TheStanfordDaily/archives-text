# Solar energy plan favored
## Board OKs record budget 
### Mike Charison 
Operating budget proposals totaling a record $108.7
million and providing for thefirst budget surplus in nine
years were approved this week by the Board of Trustees.
Approval of the 1977-78 budget topped the agenda at
the board's Monday and Tuesday meeting in San Fran
cisco.
The board also approved the bylaws of a cooperative
corporation for solar energy research, the new faculty
consulting policy and a $315,000 expenditure for com
pleting laboratory facilities at the Seelev G. Mudd
Chemistry Building.
It heard a followup report on the parent loan program
and a report on the possible repercussions of the Bakke
case.
The $108.7 million budget total represents about one
third of the University's $355 million consolidated
budget, according to Raymond Bacchetti. vice provost
for budget and planning.
$236,000 surplus
The surplus should total approximately $236,000.
This sum will be transfered to the operating budget re
serve, which has been seriously depleted because of
budget deficits since 1968-69, according to Bacchetti
and Controller Kenneth Creighton.
The board also approved the proposed bylaws tor a
new non-profit corporation which would bring the Uni
versity, California Institute of Technology, the Univer
sity of California and the University of Southern Califor
nia together in a cooperative effort to study solar energy.
The organization, the National Corporation for Solar
Energy, has submitted a proposal for funding from the
Energy Research and Development Administration
(ERDA) to undertake research in solar energy. The prop
osal is competing with similar consortiums from other
states, according to Vice Provost for Research William
Massy.
If the California group is awarded the ERDA contract,
thegroup would control the Solar Energy Research Insti
tute, and would conduct solar energy research there. A
background report submitted to the trustees estimated
the initial budget would be $5-6 million.
The institute is not expected to be located near the
University. The California proposal suggested the Insti
tute be located north of Berkeley in Pinole.
Olticial approval of the University's new faculty con
sulting policy was another board action. According to
Massy, the board approved the same policy which re
ceived the Faculty Senate's support last month.
The policy defines consulting as professional activity
related to a person's field of expertise where a fee is paid
by a third party, said Massy. The definition excludes

publishing, charitable work and "moonlighting," or
work outside a person's field, he said.
Under the policy's provisions, full-time faculty mem
bers are restricted to 13 days of consulting per academic
quarter.
The policy requires faculty members to adhere to the
policy, allows the University to question them on con
sulting activity and requiresthe University to enforce
provisions of the policy, Massy said.
Architect plans have already been drawn for the
$315,000 laboratory completion project. The facilities
are scheduled to be completed by July 1 and put into use
around Aug. 1, the project proposal stated.
The board also heard a series of reports on investments
including a followup report on the recently approved
parent loan program.
The University will spend $1500 to administer
the $1 million program to loan up to $0000 annually to
parents earning $20,000 to $00,000, according to Harry
Turner, associate director of finance.
Surcharge
The University plans to realize an eight percent return
on the loans, said Turner, so it is putting a .75 per cent
surcharge on the loans to help defer costs and build up a
bad-debt reserve.
Actual administration of the program, in dVery detail
except loan approval, is being handled by the Richard
Knight Insurance Agency. Turner said. He said Knight
will charge the University 50 centS) per loan per
month or $6 per year for the agency's services. Turner
estimated that the cost of additional bookkeeping help
here would be about $4 per loan per year, bringing
the total cost per loan to $10 per year.
Turner estimated that loans will be advanced to about
150 parents (10 per cent of next fall's entering class).
Knight is charging 50 cents per loan per month,
Turner said, because Knight will then be allowed to offer
parents insurance on their loans at a cost of 00 cents per
$1000 loaned per month. Turner said this premium rate
is "by no means exorbitant" although it is about 10 per
cent above what could be found if a parent were to shop
around competitively for the insurance.
The board also heard a report on how minority admis
sions to praduate programs here would be affected if the
California Supreme Court decision in Bakke v.the He
gents of the University of California is upheld.
Stanford will file an amicus curiae ("friend of the
court") brief in the case, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public affairs.
The brief "will not urge a conclusion," he said. "It will
simply inform the court about the consequences of its
action on minoritv recruiting."
