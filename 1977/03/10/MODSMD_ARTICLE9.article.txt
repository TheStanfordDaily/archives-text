## Killing it softly 
### 
Dave Runsten

The recent decision to discontinue
the Berlin program next year is so dis
turbing that I felt it necessary to write
my first letter to the Daily.
Berlin will be closed, and not one of
the other campuses, because of its re
cent inception: last to come, first to go.
The high cost of living in Berlin rela
tive to other cities is also cited. One
should note the objectivity of these
comparisons, for after all. who are the
members of the Overseas Studies
Committee to be making subjective
decisions about relative pedagogical
worth?
But my disappointment is not di
rected at Overseas Studies, for it is ap
parent their hands were tied by just
such a subjective decision on the part
of the administration. That is. the fate
of Berlin was already decided when
the provost decreed a 50 per cent cut in
the Overseas Studies budget.
Pay more, get less
Undergraduates should see this de
cision as a real reduction in what Stan
lord otters them for their money. Not
only do they charge higher tuition, but
they give less in return. All depart
ments and programs have been cut. but
who else of significance lost 50 per
cent? Either the administration (and
some faculty) felt Overseas Studies
were actually less worthwhile than
other programs, or they fould it politi
cally simpler to take the money from
powerless undergraduates.
Whatever the case, recent develop
ments here on campus make this deci

sion even more deplorable. Weare cur
rently being deluged with theme
houses: first French, then Italian, now
German. (One hopes that German
Studies joined this movement in de
fense, but after losing Beutelsbach and
Berlin, who can blame them?)
'Little Europe'
In the best American tradition we
gain our Weltanschauung from our
own living room. Instead ot sending
students off to grapple with the tre
mendously enlightening realities ot
another culture, the University deems
it sufficient to build a little Europe in
its own backyard.
Wei I, why not? Didn't they bring t he
Queen Mary to Long Eieach and the
London Bridge to Arizona? Besides,
the weather is really much nicer in
Palo Alto than in Berlin.
Penny pinching
As if all this were not painful
enough, we discover that the Berlin
program would cost the University
about $75,000. Stanford spends many
millions erecting questionable
edifices but cannot find $75,000 to
maintain a program of inestimable
academic value.
They cannot find $75,000 after the
city of Berlin spent $500,000 to reno
vate a villa for Stanford's rent-free use.
The absurdity of it all should be em
barrassing enough to keep us there, but
since the Provost still has not found
Overseas Studies worthy of being
named a "fundraising priority." one
begins to believe the Stanford ad-

ministration attaches little importance
to the University's reputation in
Europe.
To be fair, the Berliners did insist on
a five-year commitment. But a five
year commitment should be just what
a real university, an international uni
versity, would want in a city like Ber
lin. Where is the gratitude for the
good will and good money of the Ber
liners? Instead Stanford strings them
along, then walks out at the critical
moment.
Priorities
The Berlin program began two years
ago with only a handful of students.
There were problems and people
struggled. Now, after a great deal of
such effort and enthusiasm, some 50
students will have the important edu
cational experience of studying in Ber
lin.
This program is a success; no one
denies its worth. Yet Provost William
Miller says. "Funding will have to be
in competition with other new oppor
tunities and other programs," to re
mind us that the interests of under
graduates are still relatively unimpor
tant to Stanford.
At least the Berlin program died a
quick death instead of suffering the
slow strangulation of a Beutelsbach.
Remember them both while traveling
in Germany, for now one could do
much better there than be associated
with Stanford University.

since the Provost still has not found
Overseas Studies worthy of being
named a "fundraising priority." one
begins to believe the Stanford ad-

ministration attaches little importance
to the University's reputation in
Europe.
To be fair, the Berliners did insist on
a five-year commitment. But a five
year commitment should be just what
a real university, an international uni
versity, would want in a city like Ber
lin. Where is the gratitude for the
good will and good money of the Ber
liners? Instead Stanford strings them
along, then walks out at the critical
moment.
Priorities
The Berlin program began two years
ago with only a handful of students.
There were problems and people
struggled. Now, after a great deal of
such effort and enthusiasm, some 50
students will have the important edu
cational experience of studying in Ber
lin.
This program is a success; no one
denies its worth. Yet Provost William
Miller says. "Funding will have to be
in competition with other new oppor
tunities and other programs," to re
mind us that the interests of under
graduates are still relatively unimpor
tant to Stanford.
At least the Berlin program died a
quick death instead of suffering the
slow strangulation of a Beutelsbach.
Remember them both while traveling
in Germany, for now one could do
much better there than be associated
with Stanford University.

The recent decision to discontinue
the Berlin program next year is so dis
turbing that I felt it necessary to write
my first letter to the Daily.
Berlin will be closed, and not one of
the other campuses, because of its re
cent inception: last to come, first to go.
The high cost of living in Berlin rela
tive to other cities is also cited. One
should note the objectivity of these
comparisons, for after all. who are the
members of the Overseas Studies
Committee to be making subjective
decisions about relative pedagogical
worth?
But my disappointment is not di
rected at Overseas Studies, for it is ap
parent their hands were tied by just
such a subjective decision on the part
of the administration. That is. the fate
of Berlin was already decided when
the provost decreed a 50 per cent cut in
the Overseas Studies budget.
Pay more, get less
Undergraduates should see this de
cision as a real reduction in what Stan
lord otters them for their money. Not
only do they charge higher tuition, but
they give less in return. All depart
ments and programs have been cut. but
who else of significance lost 50 per
cent? Either the administration (and
some faculty) felt Overseas Studies
were actually less worthwhile than
other programs, or they fould it politi
cally simpler to take the money from
powerless undergraduates.
Whatever the case, recent develop
ments here on campus make this deci

sion even more deplorable. Weare cur
rently being deluged with theme
houses: first French, then Italian, now
German. (One hopes that German
Studies joined this movement in de
fense, but after losing Beutelsbach and
Berlin, who can blame them?)
'Little Europe'
In the best American tradition we
gain our Weltanschauung from our
own living room. Instead ot sending
students off to grapple with the tre
mendously enlightening realities ot
another culture, the University deems
it sufficient to build a little Europe in
its own backyard.
Wei I, why not? Didn't they bring t he
Queen Mary to Long Eieach and the
London Bridge to Arizona? Besides,
the weather is really much nicer in
Palo Alto than in Berlin.
Penny pinching
As if all this were not painful
enough, we discover that the Berlin
program would cost the University
about $75,000. Stanford spends many
millions erecting questionable
edifices but cannot find $75,000 to
maintain a program of inestimable
academic value.
They cannot find $75,000 after the
city of Berlin spent $500,000 to reno
vate a villa for Stanford's rent-free use.
The absurdity of it all should be em
barrassing enough to keep us there, but
since the Provost still has not found
Overseas Studies worthy of being
named a "fundraising priority." one
begins to believe the Stanford ad-

ministration attaches little importance
to the University's reputation in
