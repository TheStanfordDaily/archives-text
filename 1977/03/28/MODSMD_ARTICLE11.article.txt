# Letter: Manna from Heaven
## 
### 
Manna from Heaven has arrived at
Tresidder in the form of frozen yogurt.
But on paying the ransom fee of 50
cents I found that I also had to render to
Caesar his due in the form of three
cents sales tax. An insignificant levy,
except that on take out ice cream in
various California establishments
there is no sales tax. The Transition
manager assured me that it is hard to
distinguish if in fact the sybarite's de
light will be consumed on or off the
premises. Title 18 of the California
Administrative Code, Article 8, sec
tion 1603, subsections d and e provide
a clue to the applicability of tax on hot
prepared food products (hot bakery
goods and hot beverages sold for a
separate price) and food for consump
tion at facilities provided by the re
tailer. It would appear that coffee, tea,
and "food in boxes, cartons or other
wise in a form for consumption other
than at tables, chairs, or counters, or

from trays, glasses, dishes or other ta
bleware" (read ice cream cone) are not
liable to a tax if taken away from the
premises. My word that this was to be
the case did not seem to sway Caesar's
delegate, but he finally relented. When
asked about the practice of no tax for

the whole Stanford community, he
said he would "look into it." I hope
that his rigorous review will benefit
the consumer crazed by the thought of
the inequity of the yogurt tax.
