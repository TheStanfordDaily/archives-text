Ludlow, VI. (AF) — There will
be a trend towards colder
weather in the United States in
the next two decades, but the
turn of the century will bring a
warming trend, a panel of
weather forecasters said Sunday.
"We can expect a cold phase to
begin by the early 1980s that
should result in some of the col
dest temperatures in this cen
tury," said Harold Bernard, a
meteorologist from Environ
mental Research and Technol
ogy, Inc. in Concord, Mass.
Bernard said his prediction is
based on statistical research of
past years, which indicates that
cool and warm periods run in
20-year cycles.
Researchers, although they
have varying theories as to how
frequently weather patterns re
peat themselves, concur in their
projections for cold years —
especially winters — through
the 19905, said Joseph D'Aleo, a
Lyndon State College meterolog
ical instructor. He organized the
two-day conference of Northeast
forecasters.
"There are a number of cycles
scientists have been studying.
And they all seem to be coincid
ing and agreeing that in the
1980s and 1990s there will be a
return to colder weather," said
D'Aleo. summarizing the pre
dominate view at the meeting.
