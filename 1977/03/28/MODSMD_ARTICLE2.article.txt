Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Canary Is
lands (AP) â€” Two giant jetliners col
lided and burned on a foggy runway
yesterday on this Spanish island and
more than 530 persons were killed in
the worst disaster in aviation history,
the civil guard reported.
A spokesman for the Dutch airline
KLM said all 235 passengers and 14
crew members aboard its Boeing 747
were killed when it collided with a Pan
American Hoeing 747.
Pan American officials in London
said their plane was carrying 380 pas
sengers and IB crewmen. In Los
Angeles, where the Pan American
flight originated, officials said the
plane had 370 passengers.
Airport officials said 105 passengers
and an unknown number of crew
members had survived from the Pan
American plane.
KLM president Sergio Orlandini re
ported the Dutch plane was traveling
at a takeoff speed of about 156 miles
per hour when it collided with the Pan
American craft that also was maneuv
ering for takeoff.
Crossing runway
Pan American officials in New York
said that the Pan American plane was
crossing a runway when the collision
took place and that both planes were in
the process of taking off.
Moth airlines repeatedly revised the
number of people believed aboard the
planes.
Pan American said no casualty lists

would be provided until relatives of
victims had been notified.
The Spanish news agency, Cifra,
said 570 people had been killed and at
least 67 injured, 49 seriously.
Both planes were carrying tourists
on charter trips and both had been di
verted from intended landingsona sis
ter island at Las Palmas because of a
terrorist bomb blast there. Most of the
passengers in the Pan American plane
were Californians.
Orlandini said the KLM plane had
not refueled at Santa Cruz, but the Pan
American plane had taken on a full
load shortly before taking off.
In Algeria, Antonio Cubillo, leader
of a left-wing group seeking indepen
dence for the Canary Islands, said his
organization had planted the Las Pal
mas bomb. In a telephone interview

from Algiers, he said Spanish au
thorities were responsible for the dis
aster here.
Plane 'diverted'
"The Spaniards did not want the
damage seen, so they diverted the air
craft," he said.
Jim Naik of Cupertino, a survivor
from the Pan American craft, said at
Santa Cruz Ceneral Hospital he was
trying to pull his wife from the wrec
kage when the second of two explo
sions took place.
"It was so fast that I was thrown out
of the plane," he said. "And I looked
and the whole plane was on fire."
Naik's wife also was thrown clear
but was under treatment for serious
injuries.
"Words fail you when something
like this happens," said Dutch Premier

Joop den Uyl.
"There are definitely some sur
vivors," a Pan American official in
London reported. "As to how many
there are we don't know yet."
Cifra said the Santa Cruz airport,
Rodeos, was in heavy fog at the time of
the accident and that one of the planes
preparing to department crossed into
the second jet's takeoff path.
Pan American in London said the
crash occurred at 4:40 p.m. (8:40 a.m.
PST).
The worst single airline crash on re
cord was that of a Turkish DC-10 near
Paris in March 1974 in which 346
people perished.
The giant Boeing airliners, in com
mercial service since January 1970,
have been involved in only two previ
ous mishaps involving loss of life.
