10-stringed wonder
Narcisco Yepes, master of the 10-string guitar, will make
his first Stanford appearance Friday night in four years.
Performing on an instrument of his design, Yepes can play
baroque and renaissance lute music without translation.
The program will include selections by Sor and Turina.
