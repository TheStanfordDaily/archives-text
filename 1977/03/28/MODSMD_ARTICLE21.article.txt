## Interview with Stanley Kramer The
						cinema and They' 
### Howard Baldwin 
Stanley Kramer is convinced "They" is out
there. He knows "They" is controlling our lives in
ways even "we" know nothing about. Sometimes
"They" controls our lives beneficially, sometimes
not. Mostly not.
In his recently-released film, The Domino Prin
ciple, "They" is as much a character, though
nameless, faceless and physically absent, as the
actors — Gene Hackman, Candice Bergen, Richard
Widmark and Mickey Rooney — are physically
present. It was the character of "They" that at
tracted Kramer to direct the property as much as
Hackman's role as an imprisoned born loser.
"They" could be the FBI or the CIA or the military
industrial combine or anything you'd care to iden
tify as having excessive power over Americans
today. Take your choice.
Born loser
"These influences and powers," says Kramer,
"which don't always work for the will of the
people, are inherent in The Domino Principle he
cause we took a horn loser and put the heat to
him." Hackman plays a convict released from San
Quentin for the specific duty of being a pawn in an
assasination plot.
The crisis of the film comes when Hackman
throws a monkeywrench into the slick operation
by refusing to accept the assignment, since he
like us — has a choice. "He takes a stand, saving
that he will go this far and no further," explains

Kramer. Its interesting to see whether anybody in
the modern-day world really cares — whether a
system which has grown up on 'nice guys finish
last and 'winning is everything' would he willing
to sacrifice what he sacrifices and believe that he
would."
Better future
I'or all his pessimism, though, Kramer expresses
a hope that the lutiire will he better and that he,
through his films and his efforts, will be a part of
the reconstruction of society's values. "1 think I
live in peculiar times right now, when people are
afraid to believe in almost anything, including
their government. 1 don't even think they believe
in what they've been brought up to believe in —
even the shibboleths or the; basic tenets of their
own religion. They don't trust them somehow.
I tliink 1 d like to be in on the re-establishment
of some of those basic faiths. Not in the religious
sense, but in a moral sense — that integrity does
stand for something. Every film 1 make is involved
•with that, one way or another."
"They" is out there, but Stanley Kramer is too.
And he's prepared to shine his klieg lights on
" 1 hey" to ferret it out into the open where it can be
identified and ultimately subdued.
