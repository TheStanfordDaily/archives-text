In the summer of 1973 the
workers in the Brookside mines,
Harlan county, Kentucky, began
a strike that was to last for 13
months, uncovering not only the
untenably exploitive position of
the power elite (Eastover Min
ing, a subsidary of Duke Power)
but also internal corruption in
the United Mine Workers Union,
at that time controlled by W.A.
"Tony" Boyle.
The events that occurred were

not in themselves as significant
(the history of injustice is in
exhaustable) as the fact that they
were recorded by Barbara Kop
ple, a young filmmaker who
lived with the miners for the two
years of the strike and its after
math. The film is good enough to
deserve the national recogni
tion it is receiving, but even if it
were bad, the effect of an expose
by the media has predictable re
sults: localized corruption is
significantly diminished.
Filmmaking may very well be
the new style of the re
volutionaries.
The basic issues concern the
lifestyle of the miners: they are
subjected to imminent death
from cave-ins or explosions or

gradual deterioration from the
effects of black lung disease. For
this they receive inadequate
monetary compensation, if
monetary compensation is even
meaningful in this context. Cer
tainly their housing is substan
dard — shacks with no hot water
— but, as a union organiser in
the movie points out, the organi
zation is a feudal system and as
such the miners must be tied to
the land. Adequate compensa
tion would jeopardize the sys
tem by offering an avenue of es
cape.
The audience at the premier
showing gave Barbara Kopple a
standing ovation which she
acknowledged not for herself,
but for the miners. Sitting
crosslegged in a wide chair, her
jeans tucked into her boots, a
flower braided into her hair,
holding the microphone reluc
tantly, alive with nervous energy
and high on success, she discus
sed the making of the movie,
which cost about $300,000, and
was financed by various founda
tions, the United Methodist
Church and the United Church
of Christ.
Death threats
Her arrival in Harlan County
with a skeleton camera crew was
inconspicuous ("I could not get
out of the car and say: 'Hi — I'm a
filmmaker from New York!' ")
and throughout the shooting,
her role was underplayed ("We
weren't part of the problem, just
a little group of stinky weirdos.

There was a civil war going on
and they paid little attention to
us. But they did say they'd kill us
if they caught us alone").
The class struggle was en
trenched: high school home
economics classes made gowns
for the Ku Klux Klan. It is not
surprising that attempts were
made to confiscate the film and it
is inevitable that the camera
crew was fired on during the
strike.
The significance of the film lies
in its successful mixing of the
intent of social reform with the
techniques of cinema verite: we
are manipulated intoa particular
philosophical position (sym-

pathy with the miners) by a style
that pretends to be documentary
(real people in live confronta
tions, no scripts, no actors). The
content is authentic, possibly ir
refutable, but the editing slants
the perspective. This is in fact a
feature movie, complete with
flashbacks, subtitles and
background music. It has a dis

tinct message. It is well enough
composed to qualify as enter
tainment, although the ending
with its union dialectics drags
on too long. But still, it looks like
cinema verite, the uncontrolled
natural documentary of things
the way they are. The pieces are
real, but the juxtaposition is
stylized, and it is precisely this
juxtaposition that conveys the
message.
For example, the movie opens
with flashes from lights from the
miners' headlamps. Then we see
the miners themselves, lying on
long rolling conveyer belts
which take them down into the
low rocky mine bed. The

background music is a folk song
which blends perfectly with the
mood of doing the job to be done
despite the conditions. Then the
camera turns to the singer, a man
much older than his voice indi
cated, perhaps because although
his face is ancient, his spirit is
young. We see black and white
footage of life in the mines circa

1911. Mules pull the carts, the
old man describes the boss's in
junction not to let any rocks fall
on the mule. What about me, he
asks, and the boss replies that
you can al ways hire a not her ma n
but you got to buy another mule.
Deviation from cinema verite
is obvious — the music (mostly
songs from Hazel Dickens), the
flashbacks to other documen
taries, and the textual commen
tary are superimposed on the
underlying reality.
There is great economy in the
imagery, which is in all cases
oriented toward experiencing,
rather than analyzing, the situa
tion. The camera angle tilts in
the violence of the strike — we
see the world as sudden, violent
and unpredictable.
The cast, of course, is the
people of Harlan County, the
union organizers and leaders,
and the corporate executives of
Duke Power and its subsidiaries.
The people are filmed with the
utmost sensitivity for their dig
nity and courage despite their
situation. The corporate execu
tives are filmed with equivalent
sensitivity to their mindless
dismissal of the issues ("It is not
true that inhalation of coal dust
necessarily results in any im
pairment of pulmonary func
tions.")
It is an authentic record, but
the juxtaposition of this remark
by an Eastover Mining executive
with scenes from the Black Lung
Clinic in West Virginia consti

tute an editorial message.
The images are prose rather
than poetry: could Fellini's
Homo be considered a documen
tary, it would be poetry. There
are more aspects to a'Fellini
image than a logical analysis
would allow — it is rich beyond
the limits of the structure and
therefore highly, magnificently,
ambiguous. It means everything
rather than something. Prose, on
the other hand, deliberately at
tempts to delineate a set of par
ticular meanings. Ambiguity is
discouraged, and the tone is ex
pansive rather than concen
trated. Could Altman's
Nashville be considered a
documentary, it would be prose,
and Harlan County, U.S.A. is
closer to the tradition of the
prose documentary than it is to
cinema verite. The message is
specific, the images are
economic but not concentrated
and the total flow is the deliber
ate expansion of a philosophic
position.
Barbara Kopple does not con
sider herself an artist: "I'm not
an artist — political activism is
too close to the heart of my life."
Presumably she, and many of the
audience, find the terms artist
and political activist mutually
exclusive. But the insipidness of
unfiltered reality is hard to en
dure, even if easy to believe. So.

workers in the Brookside mines,
Harlan county, Kentucky, began
a strike that was to last for 13
months, uncovering not only the
untenably exploitive position of
the power elite (Eastover Min
ing, a subsidary of Duke Power)
but also internal corruption in
the United Mine Workers Union,
at that time controlled by W.A.
"Tony" Boyle.
The events that occurred were

not in themselves as significant
(the history of injustice is in
exhaustable) as the fact that they
were recorded by Barbara Kop
ple, a young filmmaker who
lived with the miners for the two
years of the strike and its after
math. The film is good enough to
deserve the national recogni
tion it is receiving, but even if it
were bad, the effect of an expose
by the media has predictable re
sults: localized corruption is
significantly diminished.
Filmmaking may very well be
the new style of the re
volutionaries.
The basic issues concern the
lifestyle of the miners: they are
subjected to imminent death
from cave-ins or explosions or

gradual deterioration from the
effects of black lung disease. For
this they receive inadequate
monetary compensation, if
monetary compensation is even
meaningful in this context. Cer
tainly their housing is substan
dard — shacks with no hot water
— but, as a union organiser in
the movie points out, the organi
zation is a feudal system and as
such the miners must be tied to
the land. Adequate compensa
tion would jeopardize the sys
tem by offering an avenue of es
cape.
The audience at the premier
showing gave Barbara Kopple a
standing ovation which she
acknowledged not for herself,
but for the miners. Sitting
crosslegged in a wide chair, her
jeans tucked into her boots, a
flower braided into her hair,
holding the microphone reluc
tantly, alive with nervous energy
and high on success, she discus
sed the making of the movie,
which cost about $300,000, and
was financed by various founda
tions, the United Methodist
Church and the United Church
of Christ.
Death threats
Her arrival in Harlan County
with a skeleton camera crew was
inconspicuous ("I could not get
out of the car and say: 'Hi — I'm a
filmmaker from New York!' ")
and throughout the shooting,
her role was underplayed ("We
weren't part of the problem, just
a little group of stinky weirdos.

There was a civil war going on
and they paid little attention to
us. But they did say they'd kill us
if they caught us alone").
The class struggle was en
trenched: high school home
economics classes made gowns
for the Ku Klux Klan. It is not
surprising that attempts were
made to confiscate the film and it
is inevitable that the camera
crew was fired on during the
strike.
The significance of the film lies
in its successful mixing of the
intent of social reform with the
techniques of cinema verite: we

pathy with the miners) by a style
that pretends to be documentary
(real people in live confronta
tions, no scripts, no actors). The
content is authentic, possibly ir
refutable, but the editing slants
the perspective. This is in fact a
feature movie, complete with
flashbacks, subtitles and
background music. It has a dis

tinct message. It is well enough
composed to qualify as enter
tainment, although the ending
with its union dialectics drags
on too long. But still, it looks like
cinema verite, the uncontrolled
natural documentary of things
the way they are. The pieces are
real, but the juxtaposition is
stylized, and it is precisely this
juxtaposition that conveys the
message.
For example, the movie opens
with flashes from lights from the
miners' headlamps. Then we see
the miners themselves, lying on
long rolling conveyer belts
which take them down into the
low rocky mine bed. The

background music is a folk song
which blends perfectly with the
mood of doing the job to be done
despite the conditions. Then the
camera turns to the singer, a man
much older than his voice indi
cated, perhaps because although
his face is ancient, his spirit is
young. We see black and white
footage of life in the mines circa

1911. Mules pull the carts, the
old man describes the boss's in
junction not to let any rocks fall
on the mule. What about me, he
asks, and the boss replies that
you can al ways hire a not her ma n
but you got to buy another mule.
Deviation from cinema verite
is obvious — the music (mostly
songs from Hazel Dickens), the
flashbacks to other documen
taries, and the textual commen
tary are superimposed on the
underlying reality.
There is great economy in the
imagery, which is in all cases
oriented toward experiencing,
rather than analyzing, the situa
tion. The camera angle tilts in
the violence of the strike — we
see the world as sudden, violent
and unpredictable.
The cast, of course, is the
people of Harlan County, the
union organizers and leaders,
and the corporate executives of
Duke Power and its subsidiaries.
The people are filmed with the
utmost sensitivity for their dig
nity and courage despite their
situation. The corporate execu
tives are filmed with equivalent
sensitivity to their mindless
dismissal of the issues ("It is not
true that inhalation of coal dust
necessarily results in any im
pairment of pulmonary func
tions.")
It is an authentic record, but
the juxtaposition of this remark
by an Eastover Mining executive
with scenes from the Black Lung
Clinic in West Virginia consti

The images are prose rather
than poetry: could Fellini's
Homo be considered a documen
tary, it would be poetry. There
are more aspects to a'Fellini
image than a logical analysis
would allow — it is rich beyond
the limits of the structure and
therefore highly, magnificently,
ambiguous. It means everything
rather than something. Prose, on
the other hand, deliberately at
tempts to delineate a set of par
ticular meanings. Ambiguity is
discouraged, and the tone is ex

content is authentic, possibly ir
refutable, but the editing slants
the perspective. This is in fact a
feature movie, complete with
flashbacks, subtitles and
background music. It has a dis

cinema verite, the uncontrolled
natural documentary of things

real, but the juxtaposition is
stylized, and it is precisely this
juxtaposition that conveys the
message.
For example, the movie opens
with flashes from lights from the
miners' headlamps. Then we see
the miners themselves, lying on
long rolling conveyer belts
which take them down into the
low rocky mine bed. The

background music is a folk song
which blends perfectly with the
mood of doing the job to be done
despite the conditions. Then the
camera turns to the singer, a man
much older than his voice indi
cated, perhaps because although
his face is ancient, his spirit is
young. We see black and white
footage of life in the mines circa

1911. Mules pull the carts, the
old man describes the boss's in
junction not to let any rocks fall
on the mule. What about me, he
asks, and the boss replies that

Deviation from cinema verite
is obvious — the music (mostly
songs from Hazel Dickens), the
flashbacks to other documen

underlying reality.
There is great economy in the
imagery, which is in all cases
oriented toward experiencing,
rather than analyzing, the situa

the violence of the strike — we
see the world as sudden, violent
and unpredictable.
The cast, of course, is the
people of Harlan County, the
union organizers and leaders,
and the corporate executives of
Duke Power and its subsidiaries.
The people are filmed with the
utmost sensitivity for their dig

sensitivity to their mindless
dismissal of the issues ("It is not

from cave-ins or explosions or

gradual deterioration from the
effects of black lung disease. For
this they receive inadequate
monetary compensation, if
monetary compensation is even
meaningful in this context. Cer
tainly their housing is substan
dard — shacks with no hot water
— but, as a union organiser in
the movie points out, the organi
zation is a feudal system and as
such the miners must be tied to
the land. Adequate compensa
tion would jeopardize the sys
tem by offering an avenue of es
cape.
The audience at the premier
showing gave Barbara Kopple a
standing ovation which she
acknowledged not for herself,
but for the miners. Sitting
crosslegged in a wide chair, her
jeans tucked into her boots, a
flower braided into her hair,
holding the microphone reluc
tantly, alive with nervous energy
and high on success, she discus
sed the making of the movie,
which cost about $300,000, and
was financed by various founda
tions, the United Methodist
Church and the United Church
of Christ.
Death threats
Her arrival in Harlan County
with a skeleton camera crew was
inconspicuous ("I could not get
out of the car and say: 'Hi — I'm a
filmmaker from New York!' ")
and throughout the shooting,
her role was underplayed ("We
weren't part of the problem, just
a little group of stinky weirdos.

There was a civil war going on
and they paid little attention to
us. But they did say they'd kill us
if they caught us alone").
The class struggle was en
trenched: high school home
economics classes made gowns
for the Ku Klux Klan. It is not
surprising that attempts were
made to confiscate the film and it
is inevitable that the camera
crew was fired on during the
strike.
The significance of the film lies
in its successful mixing of the
intent of social reform with the
techniques of cinema verite: we
are manipulated intoa particular
philosophical position (sym-

pathy with the miners) by a style
that pretends to be documentary
(real people in live confronta
tions, no scripts, no actors). The
content is authentic, possibly ir
refutable, but the editing slants
the perspective. This is in fact a
feature movie, complete with
flashbacks, subtitles and
background music. It has a dis

tinct message. It is well enough
composed to qualify as enter
tainment, although the ending
with its union dialectics drags
on too long. But still, it looks like
cinema verite, the uncontrolled
natural documentary of things
the way they are. The pieces are
real, but the juxtaposition is
stylized, and it is precisely this
juxtaposition that conveys the
message.
For example, the movie opens
with flashes from lights from the
miners' headlamps. Then we see
the miners themselves, lying on
long rolling conveyer belts
which take them down into the
low rocky mine bed. The

background music is a folk song
which blends perfectly with the
mood of doing the job to be done
despite the conditions. Then the
camera turns to the singer, a man
much older than his voice indi
cated, perhaps because although
his face is ancient, his spirit is
young. We see black and white
footage of life in the mines circa

1911. Mules pull the carts, the
old man describes the boss's in
junction not to let any rocks fall
on the mule. What about me, he
asks, and the boss replies that
you can al ways hire a not her ma n
but you got to buy another mule.
Deviation from cinema verite
is obvious — the music (mostly
songs from Hazel Dickens), the
flashbacks to other documen
taries, and the textual commen
tary are superimposed on the
underlying reality.
There is great economy in the
imagery, which is in all cases
oriented toward experiencing,
rather than analyzing, the situa
tion. The camera angle tilts in
the violence of the strike — we
see the world as sudden, violent
and unpredictable.
The cast, of course, is the
people of Harlan County, the
union organizers and leaders,
and the corporate executives of
Duke Power and its subsidiaries.
The people are filmed with the
utmost sensitivity for their dig
nity and courage despite their
situation. The corporate execu
tives are filmed with equivalent
sensitivity to their mindless
dismissal of the issues ("It is not
true that inhalation of coal dust
necessarily results in any im
pairment of pulmonary func
tions.")
It is an authentic record, but
the juxtaposition of this remark
by an Eastover Mining executive
with scenes from the Black Lung
Clinic in West Virginia consti

tute an editorial message.
The images are prose rather
than poetry: could Fellini's
Homo be considered a documen
tary, it would be poetry. There
are more aspects to a'Fellini
image than a logical analysis
would allow — it is rich beyond
the limits of the structure and
therefore highly, magnificently,
ambiguous. It means everything
rather than something. Prose, on
the other hand, deliberately at
tempts to delineate a set of par
ticular meanings. Ambiguity is
discouraged, and the tone is ex
pansive rather than concen
trated. Could Altman's
Nashville be considered a
documentary, it would be prose,
and Harlan County, U.S.A. is
closer to the tradition of the
prose documentary than it is to
cinema verite. The message is
specific, the images are
economic but not concentrated
and the total flow is the deliber
ate expansion of a philosophic
position.
Barbara Kopple does not con
sider herself an artist: "I'm not
an artist — political activism is
too close to the heart of my life."
Presumably she, and many of the
audience, find the terms artist
and political activist mutually
exclusive. But the insipidness of
unfiltered reality is hard to en
dure, even if easy to believe. So.
to make a documentary that
people will watch, one is forced
to be an artist. It is the coming
style of the revolutionary.
