# Something that's 'nothing'
## 
### Mark Funk 
There is a company here
that hopes nothing will out
sell the Pet Koc:k.
And that is exactly what it
was set up to produce — "The
Original Nothing."
The Nothing Company is
the brainchild of seniors
Marty Lynch and Hob Slobe
and Doug Post, a recent
graduate. (Operating out of a
dorrn room in Stern Hall,
their product is already avail
able in Palo Alto and should
be on sale thoughout the Bay
Area wiihin a month.
To some extent, Nothing
was inspired by the Pet Rock
craze which swept the nation
in 1975. Lynch said that the
major problem facing the
company at the moment was
getting it to buyers at stores
who have seen a myriad of Pet
Rock spin-offs.
"The Pet Rock was cute,"
Lynch said. "But you
couldn't laugh at it."
Galbraith
While the founders of "No
thing" are loath to admit it,
their hopes are rooted in John
Kenneth Galbraith's theory
on induced demand: if a
company can market an item
in an interesting, eye
catching container and then
promotes it properly, chances
are the public will buy -it
whether they need it or not.
Or as Post paraphrased,
"We think that if we can take
Nothing, package it attrac
tively and merchandize it
correctly, we can get people
to pay for it."
Two philosophies
"Since we started selling
Nothing we have found that
buyer (for retail outlets) have

two philosophies," Post ad
ded. "First of all there are the
ones who feel they can't lose
money if they don't spend
any money (for a product like
ours)."
He said this attitude was
prevalent among smaller
businesses.
"But then there are those
who feel — and these are the
people we are looking for —
that you can't make money if
you are not willing to spend
it," Post said.
Nothing is nothing
Nothing is just that. It
comes in a brown, cylindrical
tube ("made of recycled
paper") about eight inches
high. Inside are the "official
instructions."
The instructions give a
short history of the product
("Until as recently as the 19th
Century nothing was man
ufactured in many of the
small cottages of the Euro
pean countryside"). And it
suggests some uses:
—"Nothing makes a perfect
gift. Even while they are re
ceiving the most astonishing
items, people are often heard
to say, 'Nothing could please
me more!' It's true that even
the hardest-to-satisfy person
likes nothing."
—"For snacking, many
doctors recommend that, in
stead of worthless junk food,
people should try eating no
thing between meals."
—"It even has potential as a
miracle drug, for doctors have
often admitted, even in the
most critical cases, that no
thing can save the patient."
Nothing was conceived at
558 Mayfield where Post
lived until the start of this

quarter. He was a Secret Santa
and had exceeded the $:i
spending limit. "1 still hadn't
gotten anything for the per
son 1 drew," he said. "So I got
a box and put a letter in it
which explained why 'no
thing' was better than some
thing,"
The idea stayed on the back
burners for awhile until
Slobe, Lynch, Post and John
Baum, who was an original
partner, got together one
night to discuss "how to
make a million bucks."
"We were going to take out
ads in newspapers saying that
if people would send us one
dollar we would pray for
them," Lynch said. "We were
thinking of calling ourselves
the Jonas Society."
Post noted, however, that
they had no desire to defraud
the elderly, terminally ill and
mentally incompetent who
would ultimately make up
their clientele.
Then he remembered "No
thing."
Finagling
"We expanded the text that
1 wrote when 1 was a Secret
Santa," Post said. "We got a
copyright, consulted the
Legal Aid Society and started
to explore the cost of mate
rials."
After pricing tubes, finding
a suitable printer and engag
ing in some backroom finagl
ing (Baum dropped out as the
other three became more seri
ous about the venture) the No
thing Company emerged.
Although Post said he
could not reveal the start up
costs of the fledgling com
pany, Lynch thought that
$500 would be a ballpark fi

gure.
"Hut our biggest invest
ment has been time, he ad
ded.
Lynch and Slobe passed up
tri|)s to Hawaii ov ei the break
to work on Nothing. They had
to put labels on the first 1000
nothings by hand- And they
are only now beginning to
spread out over 'he Hay Area
taking their product to pros
pective buyers
The market tor novelty
items has soured somewhat
after the phenomenal success
ofPet Rocks. Imitators such as
Breeding Sand. L.A. Smog
and Junk (which is literally a
package of junk) have not
sold nearly as well.
"When we took Nothing to
the Bookstore the buyer there
told us she had purchased
some Bicentennial Air once,"
Lynch said. "She thought she
was going to be stuck with it,
she said, until some woman
from lowa bought, it all."
Nonetheless, Nothing is
now available at the
Bookstore.
Yet there was a period
when it looked like the com
pany would not get off the
ground. Two disc jockeys in
Superior Wise., had come up
with the same idea indepen
dently of Post. They came out
with it in late February, ac
cording to United Press In
ternational.
Similarities between the
California Nothing and its
Wisconsin counterpart are as
tounding. The Wisconsin
product comes in a cylindri
cal tube about the size of a
pop can. And it has a booklet
inside which attempts to de
fine nothing.

Nothing is nothing
Nothing is just that. It
comes in a brown, cylindrical
tube ("made of recycled
paper") about eight inches
high. Inside are the "official

The instructions give a
short history of the product
("Until as recently as the 19th
Century nothing was man
ufactured in many of the
small cottages of the Euro
pean countryside"). And it
suggests some uses:
—"Nothing makes a perfect
gift. Even while they are re
ceiving the most astonishing
items, people are often heard
to say, 'Nothing could please
me more!' It's true that even
the hardest-to-satisfy person
likes nothing."
—"For snacking, many
doctors recommend that, in
stead of worthless junk food,
people should try eating no
thing between meals."
—"It even has potential as a
miracle drug, for doctors have
often admitted, even in the
most critical cases, that no
thing can save the patient."
Nothing was conceived at
558 Mayfield where Post
lived until the start of this

quarter. He was a Secret Santa

spending limit. "1 still hadn't

a box and put a letter in it

The idea stayed on the back
burners for awhile until

Baum, who was an original
partner, got together one
night to discuss "how to
make a million bucks."
"We were going to take out
ads in newspapers saying that
if people would send us one
dollar we would pray for
them," Lynch said. "We were
thinking of calling ourselves
the Jonas Society."
Post noted, however, that
they had no desire to defraud
the elderly, terminally ill and
mentally incompetent who
would ultimately make up
their clientele.
Then he remembered "No

"We expanded the text that

Nothing was conceived at
558 Mayfield where Post
lived until the start of this

quarter. He was a Secret Santa
and had exceeded the $:i
spending limit. "1 still hadn't
gotten anything for the per
son 1 drew," he said. "So I got
a box and put a letter in it
which explained why 'no
thing' was better than some
thing,"
The idea stayed on the back
burners for awhile until
Slobe, Lynch, Post and John
Baum, who was an original
partner, got together one
night to discuss "how to
make a million bucks."
"We were going to take out
ads in newspapers saying that
if people would send us one
dollar we would pray for
them," Lynch said. "We were
thinking of calling ourselves
the Jonas Society."
Post noted, however, that
they had no desire to defraud
the elderly, terminally ill and
mentally incompetent who
would ultimately make up
their clientele.
Then he remembered "No
thing."
Finagling
"We expanded the text that
1 wrote when 1 was a Secret
Santa," Post said. "We got a
copyright, consulted the
Legal Aid Society and started
to explore the cost of mate
rials."
After pricing tubes, finding
a suitable printer and engag
ing in some backroom finagl
ing (Baum dropped out as the
other three became more seri
ous about the venture) the No
thing Company emerged.
Although Post said he
could not reveal the start up
costs of the fledgling com
pany, Lynch thought that
$500 would be a ballpark fi

gure.

tri|)s to Hawaii ov ei the break

told us she had purchased

Lynch said. "She thought she
was going to be stuck with it,
she said, until some woman

Bookstore.

when it looked like the com
pany would not get off the

with the same idea indepen
dently of Post. They came out
with it in late February, ac

The Original Nothing
There is a company here
that hopes nothing will out
sell the Pet Koc:k.
And that is exactly what it
was set up to produce — "The
Original Nothing."
The Nothing Company is
the brainchild of seniors
Marty Lynch and Hob Slobe
and Doug Post, a recent
graduate. (Operating out of a
dorrn room in Stern Hall,
their product is already avail
able in Palo Alto and should
be on sale thoughout the Bay
Area wiihin a month.
To some extent, Nothing
was inspired by the Pet Rock
craze which swept the nation
in 1975. Lynch said that the
major problem facing the
company at the moment was
getting it to buyers at stores
who have seen a myriad of Pet
Rock spin-offs.
"The Pet Rock was cute,"
Lynch said. "But you
couldn't laugh at it."
Galbraith
While the founders of "No
thing" are loath to admit it,
their hopes are rooted in John
Kenneth Galbraith's theory
on induced demand: if a
company can market an item
in an interesting, eye
catching container and then
promotes it properly, chances
are the public will buy -it
whether they need it or not.
Or as Post paraphrased,
"We think that if we can take
Nothing, package it attrac
tively and merchandize it
correctly, we can get people
to pay for it."
Two philosophies
"Since we started selling
Nothing we have found that
buyer (for retail outlets) have

two philosophies," Post ad
ded. "First of all there are the
ones who feel they can't lose
money if they don't spend
any money (for a product like
ours)."
He said this attitude was
prevalent among smaller
businesses.
"But then there are those
who feel — and these are the
people we are looking for —
that you can't make money if
you are not willing to spend
it," Post said.
Nothing is nothing
Nothing is just that. It
comes in a brown, cylindrical
tube ("made of recycled
paper") about eight inches
high. Inside are the "official
instructions."
The instructions give a
short history of the product
("Until as recently as the 19th
Century nothing was man
ufactured in many of the
small cottages of the Euro
pean countryside"). And it
suggests some uses:
—"Nothing makes a perfect
gift. Even while they are re
ceiving the most astonishing
items, people are often heard
to say, 'Nothing could please
me more!' It's true that even
the hardest-to-satisfy person
likes nothing."
