Can a person get locked in
Meyer overnight? Or is it possi
ble to get out through the one
way locked doors?
-j.D.
This brings to mind the es
capades of Dan Andrus, a friend
and a Stanford grad years ago,
who swears he once fell asleep in
the Main Library Stacks and
awoke to find himself in cold
and lonely solitude (give or take
a few rats and some books).
As for UGLY, Librarian
Elizabeth Salzar says that if
someone did get locked in, it's
probably because they wanted it
that way. She says closing time
is announced 15-20 minutes be
fore they lock up, and once again
at five minutes before the hour.
Finally, the portal monitor, the
person who sits at the exit and
sniffs through your backpack,
checks the building out
thoroughly.
At any rate, yes, you can get
out by way of the one-way
locked doors.
I am writing to you because I
hove a problem.
My wife has custody of our 1:1
children. They were awarded to
her when she divorced me for
desertion. My mother has been
confined to a mental institution
for insanity since I was three
years old.
I have two brothers. One at
tends Stanford and the other is
awaiting electrocution for mur
der. My two sisters are both pros
titutes and my father is a dope
pusher.
Recently I met a girl who just
finished serving time for per
forming a sex act with the local

head of the Nazi Party in the
waiting room of the Greyhound
bus station. I love this girl and I
want to marry her.
My problem is this: should I
tell her about my brother who
attends Stanford?
-B.F.
Why not? Stranger things
have been known to happen. . . .
Dear friends and neighbors,
The time has come for me to
leave the world of insects. I will
no longer be answering exotic
and erotic questions. I'm retiring
from my position as the Ann
Landers of the Stanford Daily

crack at your queries.
Send those letters to The Hug,
