## Cards take 7th at NCAA swim; Bruner sets American record 
### Jill Lieber 
Cleveland — Unbelievable.
Just plain unbelievable.
Stanford's swim team put in a
remarkable showing at the
NCAA championships in Cleve
land over the weekend finishing
seventh The meet was topped
off by two-time Olympic champ
ion Mike Bruner setting an
American record for the 200 fly
in Saturday night's finals.
"I am truly amazed with my
time," said Bruner, his head
freshly shaved. Bruner swam a
1:46.20 in the afternoon prelims
to break the last indoor, NCAA
and American imperial record
held by Olympic superstar Mark
Spitz. The previous record was
1:46.89 set in 1972.
And in the finals Brunei
smoked the field by bringing it
home in 1:45.27.
"You can't compare my win
tonight to my win in the 200 fly
in Montreal," he said. "The
Olympics are the Olympics.
Once you get in the pool it's just
a race. The U.S. has the best
competition anywhere.
"I've been working a lot on
turns this year. In my younger
days I'd lose the 200 on my
turn. Tonight I stayed a little bit
behind Billy Forrester and then
came hard out of the turns. That
won it for me."
Painful win
Bruner swam the whole meet
in pain — not pain from exhaus
tion or overexertion. The
sophomore is suffering from
bone chips in his right elbow
and was taking pain killers
throughout the meet to ease the
soreness.
He didn't let the agony go to
his head at any time during the

meet. Bruner put in a fine per
formance Thursday night
swimming io.it hird-place finish
in the 500 free in 4:21.65 — a
drop of four seconds off his pre
vious personal best. Friday he
finished 19th in the 200 free in
1:39.58.
Made a name
Swimming in one of the most
awesome fields in swimming,
senior Dave Fairbank out
touched the world record hol
ders in the 100 free. "Banks"
went up against Indiana's Jim
Montgomery, the gold medalist
in the 100-meter free in
Montreal, and Jonty Skinner of
Alabama, the world record hol
der in the 100-meter free and
dubbed "the world's fastest
swimmer."
In lane six of Saturday's finals,
Fairbank dove into the pool al
most unnoticed. All eyes were
on lanes two, three and four
where the "big names" were
churning away.
USC's Joe Bottom, in lane two,
was a favorite of the audience,
especially after his American re
cord Thursday in the 50 free of
19.70. Montgomery took over
lane three, with Skinner in four.
Who would have thought
Dave Fairbank would hit the
Omega touchplate first in 43.68?
Even Fairbank was stunned.
"I'm considered a drop-dead
sprinter," he said. "After 75
yards everything in me starts to
tighten up. That happened about
three yards off the last wall to
night. I was tired so I kept telling
myself to keep it long."
Unsung hero
The win is no doubt the high
light of Fairbank's 18-year
swimming career and is his only

NCAA title. Since serving as an
alternate on the 1972 Olympic
team, he hasn't received much —
if any — national recognition.
"Everything about my race
was just perfect. I loved being in
lane six. Everyone but me got a
big wave at the 50."
Fairbank had planned on
winning the 50 free at the
NCAAs — the race for which he
is best known — but he ended up
a disappointing fifth in 20.24.
"I was intending on quitting
swimming after the NCAAs," he
said shaking his head. "But after
the 100 win 1 think I'll stick
around for a while."
Happy day
"Banks" also swam the anchor
leg of the 400 free relay in Satur
day's finals. He and teammates
Bruner, Jon Powell and Scott
O'Connor finished sixth in
3:00.16, setting a school record.
"It's been a great day," Powell
said after receiving his NCAA
medal. "One of the best in my
life."
Stu Corliss couldn't agree
more. The junior swam to a
fifth-place finish in the 200
breast with 2:04.39.

"Fairbank warmed up the lane
for me," he said. When asked it
the performance was his lifetime
best, Corliss quickly replied,
"Hell, yes. My previous best was
2:07.8. The team is really jazzed
tonight.
"Our overall attitude has
ebbed and flowed with the per
formances. l.ast year we wen
down flat after t he first swim and
never rallied back. A few people
— freshmen especially — have
been disappointed with their
swims here. They're just getting
oriented."
Cool man
It sure didn't take frosh flier
Bob Hagberg long to cool his
nerves at the NCAAs. He shaved
his head and placed sixth Friday
in the 100 fly with 49.08. In the
afternoon prelims, Hagberg
swam a lifetime best of 48.44
"Shaving my bead was prear
ranged," he said later. "I decided
that iflgot into the finals I'd give
it everything I've got. I hoped to
go faster tonight. But I'm really
very, very happy."
The general concensus with
out a doubt.
