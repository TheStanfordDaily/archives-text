# San Jose nips Cards in 400 relay
## Sprinters renew rivalry at Stanford Invite 
### Bruce Anderson 
It was the featured invitational
events which drew the crowd of
15,000 to Stanford Stadium for
the Stanford Invitational Track
and Field Relays March 19, but
for the second straight year it
was the relays which had Bay
Area track enthusiasts talking as
they left the stadium.
Not that the individual events
were a bust. Three athletes broke
stadium records — Kenya's Mike
Hoit recorded the fastest outdoor
800-meter time in the world this
year with a 1:46.1 clocking,
Duncan Macdonald sailed to an
8:42.6 victory in the two-mile
and San lose State's Greg
Woepse cleared 17:0V4 to be
come the first pole vaulter to top
17 feet in the stadium.
Hut a come-from-behind win
by San Jose State in the 400-
meter relay brought the crowd to
its feet with its loudest response
of the day.
Defending NCAA high hurdle
titlist Dedy Cooper closed a
five-yard gap to overhaul Stan
ford's Alan Sheats and edge the
Card sprinter at the tape. San
Jose was clocked at 39.9, Stan
ford at 40.0, the second fastest
Card 400-meter (440-yard) relay
mark ever.
The renewed rivalry between
sprinters from San Joseand Stan
ford has grown into a fierce mat
ter of pride for the cindermen
from the two South Hay schools.
When the Cardinals upended
the fleet San Jose sprintmen at a
triangular meet in February, the
Spartans circled the Invitational
rematch on their calendars and
set about preparing for the sec
ond confrontation.
"We need something to moti
vate us," Cooper said after the
meet. "We're right across the hill
from each other and each team
uses the rivalry to get fired up.

It's a friendly rivalry."
Cooper, who sat out of the In
vitational hurdle competition to
concentrate on the relays, ap
peared anything but friendly
when he turned to Sheats after
the race with a taunting gesture.
"I was a little irritated by a re
mark that one of their guys made
to our guys about whether or not
we were in shape," Cooper said.
"When I turned around I was just
checking to see if they were in
shape."
Stanford went on to sweep the
half-mile, mile and two-mile re
lays, the half-mile quartet of
Marvin Holmes, James Lofton,
Gordon Banksand Sheats setting
a new Stanford mark of 1:23.7.
"The 880-relav showed we're
tough," Sheats said.
"I was particularly pleased
with our three sprint relays,"
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
said. "Losing to San Jose in the
400-meter relay is no disgrace."
In addition to the victories in
the relays, the Cards posted a
pair of wins in the field events;
freshman Ricky Brown throwing
a lifetime best of 213-1 to cop t he
javelin and Lofton capturing the
long jump with a meet record
leap of 25-1 IVi.
Meet records were broken in
the other two jumping events:
Hayward State's Dave Haber
clearing 7-0 to win the high
jump and San Jose's Ron Livers
leaping 52-OV4 in the triple jump.
Livers won the NCAA triplet
jump crown in 1975.
On the track, the smooth
running Boit easily defeated
former California half-mile
greats James Robinson and Ricky
Brown.
After the meet Boit said his
immediate goal was to regain the
800-meter world record. Boit
will meet the man who broke his
record, Cuba's Alberto Juan

torena, May 14 in the Jamaica In
ternational meet. Juantorena set
the current world record of
1:43.5 on his way to an Olympic
gold m(>da 1 last summer in
Montreal.
In the two-mile, Macdonald
eclipsed third-place finisher
Don kardong's seven-year-old
stadium record. Cal's Brad Duf
fey finished second with a per
sonal best of 8:45.6 to earn
university-division athlete of the
week honors from Northern
California track writers.
The featured shot put compet
ition fizzled when two of the ad
vertised 70-footers, Ron Semkiw
and AI Feuerbach. stayed home.
Stanford's Terry Albritton was
the only one of the 70-foot trio to
show up. And when he did show
up, it was with a still-injured
hamstring heavily taped. Mike
Weeks won the shot with a heave
ol 63-0%, nearly four feet short of
Doug Lane's stadium mark.
