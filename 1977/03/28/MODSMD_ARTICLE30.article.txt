"Judy swam head on intoa girl
at full force in warm-ups the first

the 100 free in 51.00.
Another freshman, Australian
Olympian Judy Hudson, had a
good meet, placing in the 200
fly, 200 breast, 200 and 400 IM.
"Judy swam head on intoa girl
at full force in warm-ups the first
day," Meyer said. "She could
have gone faster but she had a
headache for three days and was
dizzy every time she got out of
the pool after her races. I
wouldn't be surprised if she had
a minor concussion."
Nevertheless, Hudson placed
fourth in both the 200 IM
(2:08.15) and 400 IM (4:28.86),
13th in the 200 fly (2:06.37) and
15th in the 200 breast (2:28.94).

(2:26.77); 10th in the 50 breast
(31.54), and 13th in the 200 IM
(2:11.45).

free (4:55.57) and 1650 free

women's collegiate event and
Harshbarger is at home in the
longer distances.

relay teams which set AIAVV and
pool records. The 400 free relay
team of Lee, Margot Hagstette.
