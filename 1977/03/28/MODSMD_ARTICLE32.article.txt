# Making waves
## NCAA emotions 
### Jill Lieber 
Cleveland â€” There's something about seeing
a grown man cry that hits the heart. It makes you
want to cry right along. As (JSC superstar John
Naber stood on the No. 1 step of the awards
stand Saturday night and was handed his tenth
and final individual NCAA swimming medal,
he fought unsuccessfully to hold hack the emo
tion he was feeling. A giant tear gushed out onto
USC coach Peter Daland as he handed Naber the
award he won for the 200 back. Naber, all
6-foot-5 of him, leaned over and threw his arms
around the man who played a big part in each
and every one of those medals of the past four
years. "The world's best coach," the world's
best swimmer said later.
The end of Naber's collegiate career.
Two weeks shy of his final swim in the AAU
Nationals in Canton, Ohio.
But Naber was not the only one who was
emotional Saturday night.
"1 thought (coach) Jim (Gaughran) was going
to jump out of the stands, run over and kiss
Fairbank after his win in the 100," Stu Corliss
said. "We all jumped a mile high."
And when the Cards' 1 7-year coach awarded
Mike Hruner the first place medal for his win
ning 200 fly, an American record, he beamed
from ear to ear.
Hruner jumped off the stand and the two
walked back to the Stanford team section of the
bleachers hugging each other tightly.
Gaughran was still smiling today. Why, he
must have smiled in his sleep.
Rightfully so. The season has been a big
change in training for him as well as the swim
mers and has caused some letdowns and frust
rations for all concerned.
The Cards had always trained about 7500
yards a day tops prior to 1977 season. But this
year, with the help of '68 Olympic swim star
Debbie Meyer, Stanford jumped to 15.000 yards

a day. (Meyer trained with Sherm Chavoor of
Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento who ad
vocates lots of distance work.)
Some Stanford swimmers couldn't mix
swimming with school work and social life.
Stanford was more to them than swimming.
During the season, some were unsure so
much work would help their NCAA and AIAW
performances. Right before the Pac-H champ
ionships one swimmer said he felt strongly that
it was just too many yards.
And there were times when I'm sure even
Gaughran and Meyer wondered about the yar
dage.
"It's really hard to mix Chem 132 and two-a
day workouts," a swimmer said. "And Jim un
derstood. He said, 'Don't worry about missing
workout. (Jet your school work done and try to
stay in shape.' That's why he is the perfect
coach for Stanford."
That's just one reason. Mentally he prepared
the team. And physically? Well, every swim
mer this season, with the exception of one or
two, turned in his or her lifetime best time. And
for these swimmers that lifetime is a career that
stretched from between 10 and 18 years.
Drops in times of three or four seconds were
not uncommon. And I can't help but wonder
about the future performances of this year's
freshmen. What will three more years of high
powered training produce? Recruiting of top
AAU swimmers will improve also because
many top American teenagers are putting in
15-20,000 yards in the pool everyday and want
to continue such training in college.
"Looking back now, it was all very much
worth it," a swimmer said Saturday night and
fellow teammates standing around him agreed.
"I know it was all those yards we swam that
brought us together as a team. I don't think we
would have been as close any other way."
