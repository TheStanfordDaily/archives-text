# Lambert resigns as water polo coach

### 
Third-year coach Art Lambert
resigned as head water polo
coach Thursday, March 17. He is
a highly acclaimed coach of the
sport — one of the top in the
world.
Lambert, 42, blasted the
American water polo program in
his resignation announcement.
"I've been very dissatisfied
with the national administration
of water polo, both the NCAA
and AAIJ, for some time. After
our 197H team failed to qualify
for the Olympics, I thought
things would change. But it
seems little or nothing is being
accomplished in promoting the

sport nationally. Water polo is a
tremendous sport. It's just a
shame more isn't being done for
it."
Lambert came to Stanford in
1974 and guided the Cards to a
fourth-place NCAA finish last
year and a sixth-place spot in his
first year on the Farm.
This year as the NCAA coach
of the year and mentor of Stan
ford's first NCAA championship
team, Lambert enjoyed a fantas
tic season.
Lambert will remain as head
coach for the men's and wo
men's volleyball teams.
