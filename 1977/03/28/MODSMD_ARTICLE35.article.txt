India's new rulers unite
New Delhi, India — India's new rulers
patched up internal differences yesterday and
agreed to form a cabinet composed of the two
leading parties that ousted Indira (landhi at the
polls.
Jagjivan Ram. 68, head of the H5-million
strong untouchable caste, was named defense
minister in the government of HI-year-old
Prime Minister Morarji Desai.
Ram. one of four holdouts who boycotted
swearing-in ceremonies for the new govern
ment Saturday, said he would join Desai in
working for a "new India." A spokesman for
Desai's Janata Peoples' party, the largest bloc in
the ruling alliance, said the four would be
sworn in today.
Tht? presidential palace had announced Fri
day night that Ram. Desai's chief rival for the
prime ministership, would be a senior minister
in the new government.
Hut Ram and the three other leaders of the
alliance — H.N. Bahuguna, Ceorge Fernandes
and Raj Narain failed to appear at the instal
lation ceremony the following day, threaten
ing a major rift in the new leadership.
A government spokesman said Bahuguna
will become chemicals and fertilizer minister.
Fernandes will serve as communications
minister, and Narain, who defeated Mrs. (lan
dhi in her home constuituency, will be minis
ter for health and family planning.
Speaking to hundreds of followers yesterday
alter a meeting of his Democracy party, Ram
refused to discuss his reasons for the boycott,
calling it a "closed chapter."
Sources said Ram's action apparently stem
med from anger over Desai's being chosen
prime minister without a formal vote of al
liance parliamentarians and at his being
ranked third instead of second in the cabinet
list. The second position went to Interior
Minister (lharan Singh, deputy chairman of the
Janata party.
Ram said his decision to join thegovernment
was influenced by a personal appeal for unity
from Jayaprakash Narayan, the ailing 74-year
old spiritual father of the alliance that defeated
former Prime Minister Gandhi's Congress
party in elections this month.
Conspirators refused refuge
Bangkok, Thailand — Five leaders of an un
successful right-wing coup attempt were re
fused refuge by other Asian nations and will be
tried and possibly executed, the military
backed government said yesterday.
Thai officials said they had unsuccessfully
asked Taiwan and "several" ot her unidentified

Asian nations to grant entry to former Gen.
Chalard Hiranyasiri, his son Maj. Uswin
Hiranyasiri and three other army officers held
as leaders of the Saturday plot.
Defense Minister Sangad Chalawyu said a
joint police and military inquiry would take
place as soon as possible. I le described t he five
as "rebels" who could be sentenced to death,
but he didn't specify what charges they would
face.
Exile has normally been the most severe
penalty meted out in the many coups and coup
attempts since Thailand became a constitu
tional monarchy in 19:12.
The five rebel officers were to have left Thai
land Saturday night for Taipei and the gov
ernment had even announced their departure.
But Taiwan refused them, one Nationalist
Chinese diplomat saying it was unfair for Tha
iland "to throw their hot potatoes to Taiwan."
Prime Minister Tanin kraivixien, leader of
the conservative regime which replaced a
three-year-old civilian government after a
military coup last Oct. 6, said in a nationwide
television address that "the country has re
turned to normal."
One loyalist general and his aide were re
ported killed in the coup attempt, when .'(()()
soldiers moved into Bangkok from the pro
vinces and seized four key government and
military installations.
Thegovernment quickly surrounded what it
called the "misled" troops and won their sur
render without violence. It said the rank-and
file rebels would be dealt with leniently.
Chalard, a former deputy commander of the
army, was among the last to surrender, appa
rently on the understanding he would begiven
refuge in Thailand.
Congress mail costs $60 million
Washington — Congress has billed Ameri
can taxpayers more than $B() million for post
age after a record outpouring of mail during the
1976 election season.
Exceeding Postal Service forecasts, senators
and congressmen showered their constituents
with an unprecedented 401 million pieces of
mail in the year ending last June ;U).
Between then and the Nov. 2 elections they
sent 160 million more pieces of mail, enough to
put two letters in every American household.
This mail, marked "official business," is
mostly mass-mailed newsletters, unscientific
questionnaires, form-letter congratulatory
notes and giveaway items including calendars
and pamphlets on subjects ranging from rais
ing children to raising ducks.
Some of the mail is related directly to the

business of passing lawsor answering requests
for help in dealing with the federal govern
ment.
Congress sends about eight letters tor every
one it receives, and its own mass mailings gen
erate a good deal of what comes in.
"It's political," said one federal employe
who helps handle the mail, and who asked not
to be named. "They do it to get votes.
Members of Congress say their mailings
keep voters informed. .\ h-w admit publicly
there is another factor "When I send out a
newsletter it fulfills m\ duty to tell my con
stituents what I'm doing said Rep. Hill I-ren
zel (R-Minn.). "It also puts my name in their
house and helps me get reelected. 1 don t know
how you can separate the two.'
Rising mail costs are among the expenses
that add up to make this the first billion-dollar
Congress. Congress and its agencies are
budgeted to spend $1,016 billion this year.
In the last 10 years Congress has tripled the
amount of mail it sends, according to Postal
Service figures. With rising postal rates this
pushed total mail costsaip eight-fold in the
same period.
Costs of printing, handling and addressing
outgoing mail add nearly $10 million to the
yearly mail bill.
The Senate runs a large printing shop cost
ing $561,000 a year for salaries. The House
paid $2 million last year to private firms to
print its newsletters.
The Senate paid an estimated $671,000 tor
its computers to address hatches of "Dear Doc
tor." "Dear Veteran," or "Dear Teacher" letters
to members of various interest groups.
Congress has voted to send some mail at
lower rates and to place some new limits on
what can be sent, but it remains to be seen how
effective these changes will be. Congress out
lawed overt political appeals and set up a vol
untary screening procedure for official mail in
1973, but those rules were relatively toothless
and didn't limit volume or cost.
The citizen's group Common Cause is pres
sing a lawsuit seeking a court order banning
mass mailings at public expense, on grounds*
that they are more political than official and
unfair to election challengers.
Vance rebuffs dissidents
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday he turned down a request tor
meetings with Soviet dissidents so he could
devote all his time to nuclear arms control talks
with Kremlin leaders.
Vance arrived in the Soviet capital Saturday

night carrying a proposal for a comprehensive
arms control agreement, under which the Un
ited States and the Soviet Union would make
"deep cuts" in their strategic arsenals.
The secretary told reporters on the eve of
Monday's first round of talks that In; hoped "to
make real progress" toward establishing a
framework for future negotiations on a second
strategic arms limitation treaty.
Other topics expected to be discussed before
Vance's departure Thursday include bilateral
trade, the Middle East and Africa, the secretary
said.
Soviet officials have warned that president
Jimmy Carter's public support of dissidents
might jeopardize chances for a new arms con
trol agreement. Last Monday, Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev said normal development of
U.S.-Soviet relations was "unthinkable" as
long as the United States used the issue of
human rights to "interfere in Soviet internal
affairs."
In a commentary published yesterday, tin;
Communist party newspaper Pravda said
"time is pressing" for improvements in
Soviet-American relations and charged that
"promises made by the Democrats actively to
develop peaceful relations with the U.S.S.R.
have not yet been substantiated by deeds."
On arms control, Vance said real progress
between the United States and the Soviet
Union on limiting the spread of nuclear
weapons can only be achieved through mas
sive cuts in existing force levels. Sources
speculate the Carter administration wants to
reduce each country's strategic arsenal to
about 1800 missiles and bombers.
Death penalty O.K. for rape?
Washington — Allen and Elnita Carver were
seated at the kitchen table of their modest
Waycross, Ca., home when an intruder burst
through the door, menacingly holding a three
foot-long hunk of wood over his head.
Ceorgia authorities want the intruder,
Ehrlich Anthony Coker, to die in the electric
chairfor what happened next on that balmy fall
night in 1974.
Elnita Carver. 16 and the mother of a
3-week-old son, was raped at knifepoint while
her bound husband listened helplessly to her
sobbing and pleading.
Coker had escaped only hours before from
the nearby Ware Correctional Institution
where he was serving a life term for murder,
rape and kidnaping.
It is the case of Ehrlich Anthony Coker that
the Supreme Court has selected to decide
whether death is a just and constitutional

punishment for rape.
The nine men of the nation's highest court
will be considering that question and others
today when they hear four straight hours ol
arguments that could lead to significant
changes in the scope ot capital punishment in
the United States.
The justices also will hear arguments in
cases asking:
—Whether a mandatory death penalty tor
murderers of police officers is constitutionally
valid.
—Can a man who committed a crime
punishable by death under «i state law later
struck down as unconstitutional be con
demned some years later under a new law that
is constitutional?
—How far can prosecutors go in making im
passioned statements to the' jury in trials where
the defendant faces a possible death sentence
Last July 2. the Supreme Court re-introduced
the death penalty to American criminal justice!
when it ruled that states using certain
guidelines could impose capital punishment.
Only two years before, the court had decided
that capital punishment as then doled out by
the states was arbitrary and capricious and
therefore cruel and unusual punishment pro
hibited by the Constitution's Kighth Amend
ment.
During t he next two years, however, 30 state
legislatures drafted new laws they felt could
withstand constitutional scrutiny.
But the Supreme Court upheld the death
penalty for murderers only, explicitly reserv
ing for another day the 1 question of its imposi
tion for other crimes.
The four questions to he considered today
are not the first before the; justices since their
July decision. They surely will not be the last.

Death penalty O.K. for rape?
Washington — Allen and Elnita Carver were
seated at the kitchen table of their modest
Waycross, Ca., home when an intruder burst
through the door, menacingly holding a three
foot-long hunk of wood over his head.
Ceorgia authorities want the intruder,
Ehrlich Anthony Coker, to die in the electric
chairfor what happened next on that balmy fall
night in 1974.
Elnita Carver. 16 and the mother of a
3-week-old son, was raped at knifepoint while
her bound husband listened helplessly to her
sobbing and pleading.
Coker had escaped only hours before from
the nearby Ware Correctional Institution
where he was serving a life term for murder,
rape and kidnaping.
It is the case of Ehrlich Anthony Coker that
the Supreme Court has selected to decide
whether death is a just and constitutional

punishment for rape.
The nine men of the nation's highest court
will be considering that question and others
today when they hear four straight hours ol
arguments that could lead to significant
changes in the scope ot capital punishment in
the United States.
The justices also will hear arguments in
cases asking:
—Whether a mandatory death penalty tor
murderers of police officers is constitutionally
valid.
—Can a man who committed a crime
punishable by death under «i state law later
struck down as unconstitutional be con
demned some years later under a new law that
is constitutional?
—How far can prosecutors go in making im
passioned statements to the' jury in trials where
the defendant faces a possible death sentence
Last July 2. the Supreme Court re-introduced
the death penalty to American criminal justice!
when it ruled that states using certain
guidelines could impose capital punishment.
Only two years before, the court had decided
that capital punishment as then doled out by
the states was arbitrary and capricious and
therefore cruel and unusual punishment pro
hibited by the Constitution's Kighth Amend
ment.
During t he next two years, however, 30 state
legislatures drafted new laws they felt could
withstand constitutional scrutiny.
But the Supreme Court upheld the death
penalty for murderers only, explicitly reserv
ing for another day the 1 question of its imposi
tion for other crimes.
The four questions to he considered today
are not the first before the; justices since their
July decision. They surely will not be the last.

India's new rulers unite
New Delhi, India — India's new rulers
patched up internal differences yesterday and
agreed to form a cabinet composed of the two
leading parties that ousted Indira (landhi at the
polls.
Jagjivan Ram. 68, head of the H5-million
strong untouchable caste, was named defense
minister in the government of HI-year-old
Prime Minister Morarji Desai.
Ram. one of four holdouts who boycotted
swearing-in ceremonies for the new govern
ment Saturday, said he would join Desai in
working for a "new India." A spokesman for
Desai's Janata Peoples' party, the largest bloc in
the ruling alliance, said the four would be
sworn in today.
Tht? presidential palace had announced Fri
day night that Ram. Desai's chief rival for the
prime ministership, would be a senior minister
in the new government.
Hut Ram and the three other leaders of the
alliance — H.N. Bahuguna, Ceorge Fernandes
and Raj Narain failed to appear at the instal
lation ceremony the following day, threaten
ing a major rift in the new leadership.
A government spokesman said Bahuguna
will become chemicals and fertilizer minister.
Fernandes will serve as communications
minister, and Narain, who defeated Mrs. (lan
dhi in her home constuituency, will be minis
ter for health and family planning.
Speaking to hundreds of followers yesterday
alter a meeting of his Democracy party, Ram
refused to discuss his reasons for the boycott,
calling it a "closed chapter."
Sources said Ram's action apparently stem
med from anger over Desai's being chosen
prime minister without a formal vote of al
liance parliamentarians and at his being
ranked third instead of second in the cabinet
list. The second position went to Interior
Minister (lharan Singh, deputy chairman of the
Janata party.
Ram said his decision to join thegovernment
was influenced by a personal appeal for unity
from Jayaprakash Narayan, the ailing 74-year
old spiritual father of the alliance that defeated
former Prime Minister Gandhi's Congress
party in elections this month.
Conspirators refused refuge
Bangkok, Thailand — Five leaders of an un
successful right-wing coup attempt were re
fused refuge by other Asian nations and will be
tried and possibly executed, the military
backed government said yesterday.
Thai officials said they had unsuccessfully
asked Taiwan and "several" ot her unidentified

Asian nations to grant entry to former Gen.
Chalard Hiranyasiri, his son Maj. Uswin
Hiranyasiri and three other army officers held
as leaders of the Saturday plot.
Defense Minister Sangad Chalawyu said a
joint police and military inquiry would take
place as soon as possible. I le described t he five
as "rebels" who could be sentenced to death,
but he didn't specify what charges they would
face.
Exile has normally been the most severe
penalty meted out in the many coups and coup
attempts since Thailand became a constitu
tional monarchy in 19:12.
The five rebel officers were to have left Thai
land Saturday night for Taipei and the gov
ernment had even announced their departure.
But Taiwan refused them, one Nationalist
Chinese diplomat saying it was unfair for Tha
iland "to throw their hot potatoes to Taiwan."
Prime Minister Tanin kraivixien, leader of
the conservative regime which replaced a
three-year-old civilian government after a
military coup last Oct. 6, said in a nationwide
television address that "the country has re
turned to normal."
One loyalist general and his aide were re
ported killed in the coup attempt, when .'(()()
soldiers moved into Bangkok from the pro
vinces and seized four key government and
military installations.
Thegovernment quickly surrounded what it
called the "misled" troops and won their sur
render without violence. It said the rank-and
file rebels would be dealt with leniently.
Chalard, a former deputy commander of the
army, was among the last to surrender, appa
rently on the understanding he would begiven
refuge in Thailand.
Congress mail costs $60 million
Washington — Congress has billed Ameri
can taxpayers more than $B() million for post
age after a record outpouring of mail during the
1976 election season.
Exceeding Postal Service forecasts, senators
and congressmen showered their constituents
with an unprecedented 401 million pieces of
mail in the year ending last June ;U).
Between then and the Nov. 2 elections they
sent 160 million more pieces of mail, enough to
put two letters in every American household.
This mail, marked "official business," is
mostly mass-mailed newsletters, unscientific
questionnaires, form-letter congratulatory
notes and giveaway items including calendars
and pamphlets on subjects ranging from rais
ing children to raising ducks.
Some of the mail is related directly to the

business of passing lawsor answering requests
for help in dealing with the federal govern
ment.
Congress sends about eight letters tor every
one it receives, and its own mass mailings gen
erate a good deal of what comes in.
"It's political," said one federal employe
who helps handle the mail, and who asked not
to be named. "They do it to get votes.
Members of Congress say their mailings
keep voters informed. .\ h-w admit publicly
there is another factor "When I send out a
newsletter it fulfills m\ duty to tell my con
stituents what I'm doing said Rep. Hill I-ren
zel (R-Minn.). "It also puts my name in their
house and helps me get reelected. 1 don t know
how you can separate the two.'
Rising mail costs are among the expenses
that add up to make this the first billion-dollar
Congress. Congress and its agencies are
budgeted to spend $1,016 billion this year.
In the last 10 years Congress has tripled the
amount of mail it sends, according to Postal
Service figures. With rising postal rates this
pushed total mail costsaip eight-fold in the
same period.
Costs of printing, handling and addressing
outgoing mail add nearly $10 million to the
yearly mail bill.
The Senate runs a large printing shop cost
ing $561,000 a year for salaries. The House
paid $2 million last year to private firms to
print its newsletters.
The Senate paid an estimated $671,000 tor
its computers to address hatches of "Dear Doc
tor." "Dear Veteran," or "Dear Teacher" letters
to members of various interest groups.
Congress has voted to send some mail at
lower rates and to place some new limits on
what can be sent, but it remains to be seen how
effective these changes will be. Congress out
lawed overt political appeals and set up a vol
untary screening procedure for official mail in
1973, but those rules were relatively toothless
and didn't limit volume or cost.
The citizen's group Common Cause is pres
sing a lawsuit seeking a court order banning
mass mailings at public expense, on grounds*
that they are more political than official and
unfair to election challengers.
Vance rebuffs dissidents
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday he turned down a request tor
meetings with Soviet dissidents so he could
devote all his time to nuclear arms control talks
with Kremlin leaders.
Vance arrived in the Soviet capital Saturday

night carrying a proposal for a comprehensive
arms control agreement, under which the Un
ited States and the Soviet Union would make
"deep cuts" in their strategic arsenals.
The secretary told reporters on the eve of
Monday's first round of talks that In; hoped "to
make real progress" toward establishing a
framework for future negotiations on a second
strategic arms limitation treaty.
Other topics expected to be discussed before
Vance's departure Thursday include bilateral
trade, the Middle East and Africa, the secretary
said.
Soviet officials have warned that president
Jimmy Carter's public support of dissidents
might jeopardize chances for a new arms con
trol agreement. Last Monday, Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev said normal development of
U.S.-Soviet relations was "unthinkable" as
long as the United States used the issue of
human rights to "interfere in Soviet internal
affairs."
In a commentary published yesterday, tin;
Communist party newspaper Pravda said
"time is pressing" for improvements in
Soviet-American relations and charged that
"promises made by the Democrats actively to
develop peaceful relations with the U.S.S.R.
have not yet been substantiated by deeds."
On arms control, Vance said real progress
between the United States and the Soviet
Union on limiting the spread of nuclear
weapons can only be achieved through mas
sive cuts in existing force levels. Sources
speculate the Carter administration wants to
reduce each country's strategic arsenal to
about 1800 missiles and bombers.

Vance rebuffs dissidents
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday he turned down a request tor
meetings with Soviet dissidents so he could
devote all his time to nuclear arms control talks
with Kremlin leaders.
Vance arrived in the Soviet capital Saturday

night carrying a proposal for a comprehensive
arms control agreement, under which the Un
ited States and the Soviet Union would make
"deep cuts" in their strategic arsenals.
The secretary told reporters on the eve of
Monday's first round of talks that In; hoped "to
make real progress" toward establishing a
framework for future negotiations on a second
strategic arms limitation treaty.
Other topics expected to be discussed before
Vance's departure Thursday include bilateral
trade, the Middle East and Africa, the secretary
said.
Soviet officials have warned that president
Jimmy Carter's public support of dissidents
might jeopardize chances for a new arms con
trol agreement. Last Monday, Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev said normal development of
U.S.-Soviet relations was "unthinkable" as
long as the United States used the issue of
human rights to "interfere in Soviet internal
affairs."
In a commentary published yesterday, tin;
Communist party newspaper Pravda said
"time is pressing" for improvements in
Soviet-American relations and charged that
"promises made by the Democrats actively to
develop peaceful relations with the U.S.S.R.
have not yet been substantiated by deeds."
On arms control, Vance said real progress
between the United States and the Soviet
Union on limiting the spread of nuclear
weapons can only be achieved through mas
sive cuts in existing force levels. Sources
speculate the Carter administration wants to
reduce each country's strategic arsenal to
about 1800 missiles and bombers.
Death penalty O.K. for rape?
Washington — Allen and Elnita Carver were
seated at the kitchen table of their modest
Waycross, Ca., home when an intruder burst
through the door, menacingly holding a three
foot-long hunk of wood over his head.
Ceorgia authorities want the intruder,
Ehrlich Anthony Coker, to die in the electric
chairfor what happened next on that balmy fall
night in 1974.
Elnita Carver. 16 and the mother of a
3-week-old son, was raped at knifepoint while
her bound husband listened helplessly to her
sobbing and pleading.
Coker had escaped only hours before from
the nearby Ware Correctional Institution
where he was serving a life term for murder,
rape and kidnaping.
It is the case of Ehrlich Anthony Coker that
the Supreme Court has selected to decide
whether death is a just and constitutional

punishment for rape.
The nine men of the nation's highest court
will be considering that question and others
today when they hear four straight hours ol
arguments that could lead to significant
changes in the scope ot capital punishment in
the United States.
The justices also will hear arguments in
cases asking:
—Whether a mandatory death penalty tor
murderers of police officers is constitutionally
valid.
—Can a man who committed a crime
punishable by death under «i state law later
struck down as unconstitutional be con
demned some years later under a new law that
is constitutional?
—How far can prosecutors go in making im
passioned statements to the' jury in trials where
the defendant faces a possible death sentence
Last July 2. the Supreme Court re-introduced
the death penalty to American criminal justice!
when it ruled that states using certain
guidelines could impose capital punishment.
Only two years before, the court had decided
that capital punishment as then doled out by
the states was arbitrary and capricious and
therefore cruel and unusual punishment pro
hibited by the Constitution's Kighth Amend
ment.
During t he next two years, however, 30 state
legislatures drafted new laws they felt could
withstand constitutional scrutiny.
But the Supreme Court upheld the death
penalty for murderers only, explicitly reserv
ing for another day the 1 question of its imposi
tion for other crimes.
The four questions to he considered today
are not the first before the; justices since their
July decision. They surely will not be the last.

India's new rulers unite
New Delhi, India — India's new rulers
patched up internal differences yesterday and
agreed to form a cabinet composed of the two
leading parties that ousted Indira (landhi at the
polls.
Jagjivan Ram. 68, head of the H5-million
strong untouchable caste, was named defense
minister in the government of HI-year-old
Prime Minister Morarji Desai.
Ram. one of four holdouts who boycotted
swearing-in ceremonies for the new govern
ment Saturday, said he would join Desai in
working for a "new India." A spokesman for
Desai's Janata Peoples' party, the largest bloc in
the ruling alliance, said the four would be
sworn in today.
Tht? presidential palace had announced Fri
day night that Ram. Desai's chief rival for the
prime ministership, would be a senior minister
in the new government.
Hut Ram and the three other leaders of the
alliance — H.N. Bahuguna, Ceorge Fernandes
and Raj Narain failed to appear at the instal
lation ceremony the following day, threaten
ing a major rift in the new leadership.
A government spokesman said Bahuguna
will become chemicals and fertilizer minister.
Fernandes will serve as communications
minister, and Narain, who defeated Mrs. (lan
dhi in her home constuituency, will be minis
ter for health and family planning.
Speaking to hundreds of followers yesterday
alter a meeting of his Democracy party, Ram
refused to discuss his reasons for the boycott,
calling it a "closed chapter."
Sources said Ram's action apparently stem
med from anger over Desai's being chosen
prime minister without a formal vote of al
liance parliamentarians and at his being
ranked third instead of second in the cabinet
list. The second position went to Interior
Minister (lharan Singh, deputy chairman of the
Janata party.
Ram said his decision to join thegovernment
was influenced by a personal appeal for unity
from Jayaprakash Narayan, the ailing 74-year
old spiritual father of the alliance that defeated
former Prime Minister Gandhi's Congress
party in elections this month.
Conspirators refused refuge
Bangkok, Thailand — Five leaders of an un
successful right-wing coup attempt were re
fused refuge by other Asian nations and will be
tried and possibly executed, the military
backed government said yesterday.
Thai officials said they had unsuccessfully
asked Taiwan and "several" ot her unidentified

Asian nations to grant entry to former Gen.
Chalard Hiranyasiri, his son Maj. Uswin
Hiranyasiri and three other army officers held
as leaders of the Saturday plot.
Defense Minister Sangad Chalawyu said a
joint police and military inquiry would take
place as soon as possible. I le described t he five
as "rebels" who could be sentenced to death,
but he didn't specify what charges they would
face.
Exile has normally been the most severe
penalty meted out in the many coups and coup
attempts since Thailand became a constitu
tional monarchy in 19:12.
The five rebel officers were to have left Thai
land Saturday night for Taipei and the gov
ernment had even announced their departure.
But Taiwan refused them, one Nationalist
Chinese diplomat saying it was unfair for Tha
iland "to throw their hot potatoes to Taiwan."
Prime Minister Tanin kraivixien, leader of
the conservative regime which replaced a
three-year-old civilian government after a
military coup last Oct. 6, said in a nationwide
television address that "the country has re
turned to normal."
One loyalist general and his aide were re
ported killed in the coup attempt, when .'(()()
soldiers moved into Bangkok from the pro
vinces and seized four key government and
military installations.
Thegovernment quickly surrounded what it
called the "misled" troops and won their sur
render without violence. It said the rank-and
file rebels would be dealt with leniently.
Chalard, a former deputy commander of the
army, was among the last to surrender, appa
rently on the understanding he would begiven
refuge in Thailand.
Congress mail costs $60 million
Washington — Congress has billed Ameri
can taxpayers more than $B() million for post
age after a record outpouring of mail during the
1976 election season.
Exceeding Postal Service forecasts, senators
and congressmen showered their constituents
with an unprecedented 401 million pieces of
mail in the year ending last June ;U).
Between then and the Nov. 2 elections they
sent 160 million more pieces of mail, enough to
put two letters in every American household.
This mail, marked "official business," is
mostly mass-mailed newsletters, unscientific
questionnaires, form-letter congratulatory
notes and giveaway items including calendars
and pamphlets on subjects ranging from rais
ing children to raising ducks.
Some of the mail is related directly to the

business of passing lawsor answering requests
for help in dealing with the federal govern
ment.
Congress sends about eight letters tor every
one it receives, and its own mass mailings gen
erate a good deal of what comes in.
"It's political," said one federal employe
who helps handle the mail, and who asked not
to be named. "They do it to get votes.
Members of Congress say their mailings
keep voters informed. .\ h-w admit publicly

Bangkok, Thailand — Five leaders of an un
successful right-wing coup attempt were re
fused refuge by other Asian nations and will be
tried and possibly executed, the military
backed government said yesterday.
Thai officials said they had unsuccessfully
asked Taiwan and "several" ot her unidentified

Asian nations to grant entry to former Gen.
Chalard Hiranyasiri, his son Maj. Uswin
Hiranyasiri and three other army officers held
as leaders of the Saturday plot.
Defense Minister Sangad Chalawyu said a
joint police and military inquiry would take
place as soon as possible. I le described t he five
as "rebels" who could be sentenced to death,
but he didn't specify what charges they would
face.
Exile has normally been the most severe
penalty meted out in the many coups and coup
attempts since Thailand became a constitu
tional monarchy in 19:12.
The five rebel officers were to have left Thai
land Saturday night for Taipei and the gov
ernment had even announced their departure.
But Taiwan refused them, one Nationalist
Chinese diplomat saying it was unfair for Tha
iland "to throw their hot potatoes to Taiwan."
Prime Minister Tanin kraivixien, leader of
the conservative regime which replaced a
three-year-old civilian government after a
military coup last Oct. 6, said in a nationwide
television address that "the country has re
turned to normal."
One loyalist general and his aide were re
ported killed in the coup attempt, when .'(()()
soldiers moved into Bangkok from the pro
vinces and seized four key government and
military installations.
Thegovernment quickly surrounded what it
called the "misled" troops and won their sur
render without violence. It said the rank-and
file rebels would be dealt with leniently.
Chalard, a former deputy commander of the
army, was among the last to surrender, appa
rently on the understanding he would begiven
refuge in Thailand.
Congress mail costs $60 million
Washington — Congress has billed Ameri
can taxpayers more than $B() million for post
age after a record outpouring of mail during the
1976 election season.
Exceeding Postal Service forecasts, senators
and congressmen showered their constituents
with an unprecedented 401 million pieces of
mail in the year ending last June ;U).
Between then and the Nov. 2 elections they
sent 160 million more pieces of mail, enough to
put two letters in every American household.
This mail, marked "official business," is
mostly mass-mailed newsletters, unscientific
questionnaires, form-letter congratulatory
notes and giveaway items including calendars
and pamphlets on subjects ranging from rais
ing children to raising ducks.
Some of the mail is related directly to the

business of passing lawsor answering requests
for help in dealing with the federal govern
ment.
Congress sends about eight letters tor every
one it receives, and its own mass mailings gen
erate a good deal of what comes in.
"It's political," said one federal employe
who helps handle the mail, and who asked not
to be named. "They do it to get votes.
Members of Congress say their mailings
keep voters informed. .\ h-w admit publicly
there is another factor "When I send out a
newsletter it fulfills m\ duty to tell my con
stituents what I'm doing said Rep. Hill I-ren
zel (R-Minn.). "It also puts my name in their
house and helps me get reelected. 1 don t know
how you can separate the two.'
Rising mail costs are among the expenses
that add up to make this the first billion-dollar
Congress. Congress and its agencies are
budgeted to spend $1,016 billion this year.
In the last 10 years Congress has tripled the
amount of mail it sends, according to Postal
Service figures. With rising postal rates this
pushed total mail costsaip eight-fold in the
same period.
Costs of printing, handling and addressing
outgoing mail add nearly $10 million to the
yearly mail bill.
The Senate runs a large printing shop cost
ing $561,000 a year for salaries. The House
paid $2 million last year to private firms to
print its newsletters.
The Senate paid an estimated $671,000 tor
its computers to address hatches of "Dear Doc
tor." "Dear Veteran," or "Dear Teacher" letters
to members of various interest groups.
Congress has voted to send some mail at
lower rates and to place some new limits on
what can be sent, but it remains to be seen how
effective these changes will be. Congress out
lawed overt political appeals and set up a vol
untary screening procedure for official mail in
1973, but those rules were relatively toothless
and didn't limit volume or cost.
The citizen's group Common Cause is pres
sing a lawsuit seeking a court order banning
mass mailings at public expense, on grounds*
that they are more political than official and
unfair to election challengers.
Vance rebuffs dissidents
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday he turned down a request tor
meetings with Soviet dissidents so he could
devote all his time to nuclear arms control talks
with Kremlin leaders.
Vance arrived in the Soviet capital Saturday

night carrying a proposal for a comprehensive
arms control agreement, under which the Un
ited States and the Soviet Union would make
"deep cuts" in their strategic arsenals.
The secretary told reporters on the eve of
Monday's first round of talks that In; hoped "to
make real progress" toward establishing a
framework for future negotiations on a second
strategic arms limitation treaty.
Other topics expected to be discussed before
Vance's departure Thursday include bilateral
trade, the Middle East and Africa, the secretary
said.
Soviet officials have warned that president
Jimmy Carter's public support of dissidents
might jeopardize chances for a new arms con
trol agreement. Last Monday, Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev said normal development of
U.S.-Soviet relations was "unthinkable" as
long as the United States used the issue of
human rights to "interfere in Soviet internal
affairs."
In a commentary published yesterday, tin;
Communist party newspaper Pravda said
"time is pressing" for improvements in
Soviet-American relations and charged that
"promises made by the Democrats actively to
develop peaceful relations with the U.S.S.R.
have not yet been substantiated by deeds."
On arms control, Vance said real progress
between the United States and the Soviet
Union on limiting the spread of nuclear
weapons can only be achieved through mas
sive cuts in existing force levels. Sources
speculate the Carter administration wants to
reduce each country's strategic arsenal to
about 1800 missiles and bombers.
Death penalty O.K. for rape?
Washington — Allen and Elnita Carver were
seated at the kitchen table of their modest
Waycross, Ca., home when an intruder burst
through the door, menacingly holding a three
foot-long hunk of wood over his head.
Ceorgia authorities want the intruder,
Ehrlich Anthony Coker, to die in the electric
chairfor what happened next on that balmy fall
night in 1974.
Elnita Carver. 16 and the mother of a
3-week-old son, was raped at knifepoint while
her bound husband listened helplessly to her
sobbing and pleading.
Coker had escaped only hours before from
the nearby Ware Correctional Institution
where he was serving a life term for murder,
rape and kidnaping.
It is the case of Ehrlich Anthony Coker that
the Supreme Court has selected to decide
whether death is a just and constitutional

punishment for rape.
The nine men of the nation's highest court
will be considering that question and others
today when they hear four straight hours ol
arguments that could lead to significant
changes in the scope ot capital punishment in
the United States.
The justices also will hear arguments in
cases asking:
—Whether a mandatory death penalty tor
murderers of police officers is constitutionally
valid.
—Can a man who committed a crime
punishable by death under «i state law later
struck down as unconstitutional be con
demned some years later under a new law that
is constitutional?
—How far can prosecutors go in making im
passioned statements to the' jury in trials where
the defendant faces a possible death sentence
Last July 2. the Supreme Court re-introduced
the death penalty to American criminal justice!
when it ruled that states using certain
guidelines could impose capital punishment.
Only two years before, the court had decided
that capital punishment as then doled out by
the states was arbitrary and capricious and
therefore cruel and unusual punishment pro
hibited by the Constitution's Kighth Amend
ment.
During t he next two years, however, 30 state
legislatures drafted new laws they felt could
withstand constitutional scrutiny.
But the Supreme Court upheld the death
penalty for murderers only, explicitly reserv
ing for another day the 1 question of its imposi
tion for other crimes.
The four questions to he considered today
are not the first before the; justices since their
July decision. They surely will not be the last.

India's new rulers unite
New Delhi, India — India's new rulers
patched up internal differences yesterday and
agreed to form a cabinet composed of the two
leading parties that ousted Indira (landhi at the
polls.
Jagjivan Ram. 68, head of the H5-million
strong untouchable caste, was named defense
minister in the government of HI-year-old
Prime Minister Morarji Desai.
Ram. one of four holdouts who boycotted
swearing-in ceremonies for the new govern
ment Saturday, said he would join Desai in
working for a "new India." A spokesman for
Desai's Janata Peoples' party, the largest bloc in
the ruling alliance, said the four would be
sworn in today.
Tht? presidential palace had announced Fri
day night that Ram. Desai's chief rival for the
prime ministership, would be a senior minister
in the new government.
Hut Ram and the three other leaders of the
alliance — H.N. Bahuguna, Ceorge Fernandes
and Raj Narain failed to appear at the instal
lation ceremony the following day, threaten
ing a major rift in the new leadership.
A government spokesman said Bahuguna
will become chemicals and fertilizer minister.
Fernandes will serve as communications
minister, and Narain, who defeated Mrs. (lan
dhi in her home constuituency, will be minis
ter for health and family planning.
Speaking to hundreds of followers yesterday
alter a meeting of his Democracy party, Ram
refused to discuss his reasons for the boycott,
calling it a "closed chapter."
Sources said Ram's action apparently stem
med from anger over Desai's being chosen
prime minister without a formal vote of al
liance parliamentarians and at his being
ranked third instead of second in the cabinet
list. The second position went to Interior
Minister (lharan Singh, deputy chairman of the
Janata party.
Ram said his decision to join thegovernment
was influenced by a personal appeal for unity
from Jayaprakash Narayan, the ailing 74-year
old spiritual father of the alliance that defeated
former Prime Minister Gandhi's Congress
party in elections this month.

India's new rulers unite
New Delhi, India — India's new rulers
patched up internal differences yesterday and
agreed to form a cabinet composed of the two
leading parties that ousted Indira (landhi at the
polls.
Jagjivan Ram. 68, head of the H5-million
strong untouchable caste, was named defense
minister in the government of HI-year-old
Prime Minister Morarji Desai.
Ram. one of four holdouts who boycotted
swearing-in ceremonies for the new govern
ment Saturday, said he would join Desai in
working for a "new India." A spokesman for
Desai's Janata Peoples' party, the largest bloc in
the ruling alliance, said the four would be
sworn in today.
Tht? presidential palace had announced Fri
day night that Ram. Desai's chief rival for the
prime ministership, would be a senior minister
in the new government.
Hut Ram and the three other leaders of the
alliance — H.N. Bahuguna, Ceorge Fernandes
and Raj Narain failed to appear at the instal
lation ceremony the following day, threaten
ing a major rift in the new leadership.
A government spokesman said Bahuguna
will become chemicals and fertilizer minister.
Fernandes will serve as communications
minister, and Narain, who defeated Mrs. (lan
dhi in her home constuituency, will be minis
ter for health and family planning.
Speaking to hundreds of followers yesterday
alter a meeting of his Democracy party, Ram
refused to discuss his reasons for the boycott,
calling it a "closed chapter."
Sources said Ram's action apparently stem
med from anger over Desai's being chosen
prime minister without a formal vote of al
liance parliamentarians and at his being
ranked third instead of second in the cabinet
list. The second position went to Interior
Minister (lharan Singh, deputy chairman of the
Janata party.
Ram said his decision to join thegovernment
was influenced by a personal appeal for unity
from Jayaprakash Narayan, the ailing 74-year
old spiritual father of the alliance that defeated
former Prime Minister Gandhi's Congress
party in elections this month.
Conspirators refused refuge
Bangkok, Thailand — Five leaders of an un
successful right-wing coup attempt were re
fused refuge by other Asian nations and will be
tried and possibly executed, the military
backed government said yesterday.
Thai officials said they had unsuccessfully
asked Taiwan and "several" ot her unidentified

Asian nations to grant entry to former Gen.
Chalard Hiranyasiri, his son Maj. Uswin
Hiranyasiri and three other army officers held
as leaders of the Saturday plot.
Defense Minister Sangad Chalawyu said a
joint police and military inquiry would take
place as soon as possible. I le described t he five
as "rebels" who could be sentenced to death,
but he didn't specify what charges they would
face.
Exile has normally been the most severe
penalty meted out in the many coups and coup
attempts since Thailand became a constitu
tional monarchy in 19:12.
The five rebel officers were to have left Thai
land Saturday night for Taipei and the gov
ernment had even announced their departure.
But Taiwan refused them, one Nationalist
Chinese diplomat saying it was unfair for Tha
iland "to throw their hot potatoes to Taiwan."
Prime Minister Tanin kraivixien, leader of
the conservative regime which replaced a
three-year-old civilian government after a
military coup last Oct. 6, said in a nationwide
television address that "the country has re
turned to normal."
One loyalist general and his aide were re
ported killed in the coup attempt, when .'(()()
soldiers moved into Bangkok from the pro
vinces and seized four key government and
military installations.
Thegovernment quickly surrounded what it
called the "misled" troops and won their sur
render without violence. It said the rank-and
file rebels would be dealt with leniently.
Chalard, a former deputy commander of the
army, was among the last to surrender, appa
rently on the understanding he would begiven
refuge in Thailand.
Congress mail costs $60 million
Washington — Congress has billed Ameri
can taxpayers more than $B() million for post
age after a record outpouring of mail during the
1976 election season.
Exceeding Postal Service forecasts, senators
and congressmen showered their constituents
with an unprecedented 401 million pieces of
mail in the year ending last June ;U).
Between then and the Nov. 2 elections they
sent 160 million more pieces of mail, enough to
put two letters in every American household.
This mail, marked "official business," is
mostly mass-mailed newsletters, unscientific
questionnaires, form-letter congratulatory
notes and giveaway items including calendars
and pamphlets on subjects ranging from rais
ing children to raising ducks.
Some of the mail is related directly to the

business of passing lawsor answering requests
for help in dealing with the federal govern
ment.
Congress sends about eight letters tor every
one it receives, and its own mass mailings gen
erate a good deal of what comes in.
"It's political," said one federal employe
who helps handle the mail, and who asked not
to be named. "They do it to get votes.
Members of Congress say their mailings
keep voters informed. .\ h-w admit publicly
there is another factor "When I send out a
newsletter it fulfills m\ duty to tell my con
stituents what I'm doing said Rep. Hill I-ren
zel (R-Minn.). "It also puts my name in their
house and helps me get reelected. 1 don t know
how you can separate the two.'
Rising mail costs are among the expenses
that add up to make this the first billion-dollar
Congress. Congress and its agencies are
budgeted to spend $1,016 billion this year.
In the last 10 years Congress has tripled the
amount of mail it sends, according to Postal
Service figures. With rising postal rates this
pushed total mail costsaip eight-fold in the
same period.
Costs of printing, handling and addressing
outgoing mail add nearly $10 million to the
yearly mail bill.
The Senate runs a large printing shop cost
ing $561,000 a year for salaries. The House
paid $2 million last year to private firms to
print its newsletters.
The Senate paid an estimated $671,000 tor
its computers to address hatches of "Dear Doc
tor." "Dear Veteran," or "Dear Teacher" letters
to members of various interest groups.
Congress has voted to send some mail at
lower rates and to place some new limits on
what can be sent, but it remains to be seen how
effective these changes will be. Congress out
lawed overt political appeals and set up a vol
untary screening procedure for official mail in
1973, but those rules were relatively toothless
and didn't limit volume or cost.
The citizen's group Common Cause is pres
sing a lawsuit seeking a court order banning
mass mailings at public expense, on grounds*
that they are more political than official and
unfair to election challengers.
Vance rebuffs dissidents
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday he turned down a request tor
meetings with Soviet dissidents so he could
devote all his time to nuclear arms control talks
with Kremlin leaders.
Vance arrived in the Soviet capital Saturday

night carrying a proposal for a comprehensive
arms control agreement, under which the Un
ited States and the Soviet Union would make
"deep cuts" in their strategic arsenals.
The secretary told reporters on the eve of
Monday's first round of talks that In; hoped "to
make real progress" toward establishing a
framework for future negotiations on a second
strategic arms limitation treaty.
Other topics expected to be discussed before
Vance's departure Thursday include bilateral
trade, the Middle East and Africa, the secretary
said.
Soviet officials have warned that president
Jimmy Carter's public support of dissidents
might jeopardize chances for a new arms con
trol agreement. Last Monday, Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev said normal development of
U.S.-Soviet relations was "unthinkable" as
long as the United States used the issue of
human rights to "interfere in Soviet internal
affairs."
In a commentary published yesterday, tin;
Communist party newspaper Pravda said
"time is pressing" for improvements in
Soviet-American relations and charged that
"promises made by the Democrats actively to
develop peaceful relations with the U.S.S.R.
have not yet been substantiated by deeds."
On arms control, Vance said real progress
between the United States and the Soviet
Union on limiting the spread of nuclear
weapons can only be achieved through mas
sive cuts in existing force levels. Sources
speculate the Carter administration wants to
reduce each country's strategic arsenal to
about 1800 missiles and bombers.
Death penalty O.K. for rape?
Washington — Allen and Elnita Carver were
seated at the kitchen table of their modest
Waycross, Ca., home when an intruder burst
through the door, menacingly holding a three
foot-long hunk of wood over his head.
Ceorgia authorities want the intruder,
Ehrlich Anthony Coker, to die in the electric
chairfor what happened next on that balmy fall
night in 1974.
Elnita Carver. 16 and the mother of a
3-week-old son, was raped at knifepoint while
her bound husband listened helplessly to her
sobbing and pleading.
Coker had escaped only hours before from
the nearby Ware Correctional Institution
where he was serving a life term for murder,
rape and kidnaping.
It is the case of Ehrlich Anthony Coker that
the Supreme Court has selected to decide
whether death is a just and constitutional

punishment for rape.
The nine men of the nation's highest court
will be considering that question and others
today when they hear four straight hours ol
arguments that could lead to significant
changes in the scope ot capital punishment in
the United States.
The justices also will hear arguments in
cases asking:
—Whether a mandatory death penalty tor
murderers of police officers is constitutionally
valid.
—Can a man who committed a crime
punishable by death under «i state law later
struck down as unconstitutional be con
demned some years later under a new law that
is constitutional?
—How far can prosecutors go in making im
passioned statements to the' jury in trials where
the defendant faces a possible death sentence
Last July 2. the Supreme Court re-introduced
the death penalty to American criminal justice!
when it ruled that states using certain
guidelines could impose capital punishment.
Only two years before, the court had decided
that capital punishment as then doled out by
the states was arbitrary and capricious and
therefore cruel and unusual punishment pro
hibited by the Constitution's Kighth Amend
ment.
During t he next two years, however, 30 state
legislatures drafted new laws they felt could
withstand constitutional scrutiny.
But the Supreme Court upheld the death
penalty for murderers only, explicitly reserv
ing for another day the 1 question of its imposi
tion for other crimes.
The four questions to he considered today
are not the first before the; justices since their
July decision. They surely will not be the last.
