# 'Project Crew' instituted
## Custodial work reorganized 
### Sue Lesjak 
In an effort to improve the efficiency and quality of
custodial services here, the University has created a Pro
ject Crew whose members will fill in for absent employes
and do the more specialized cleaning, according to
Lucille Maravilla, assistant manager of residences,
housekeeping services.
Project Crew members are custodians who were previ
ously assigned to specific dormitories. The creation of
the crew has led to a reduction in the number of custo
dians assigned to Lagunita, Stern and Wilbur. However,
the staff size has not changed, said Maravilla.
"1 just reorganized the work distribution." she said.
"I'm not terminating anyone."
The Project Crew will serve as a pool from which
temporary substitutes for absent employes will betaken,
said Maravilla. Crew members will also do the more
specialized cleaning jobs such as window washing, rug
shampooing, floor stripping, buffing and waxing, she
said.
The decision to reorganize the custodial service was
made after the rising cost of cleaning equipment and
products (the prices of some products rose BO to 70 per
cent during the past year) prompted the administration
to ask for an examination of the custodial service, said
Maravilla.
"When the employes initially learned ot Maravilla's
plans to reorganize, they were worried they'd be given
more work," said Rafael Verbera, the United Stanford
Employees steward representing Florence Moore and
Row House custodians.
Some work more
The reorganization, which went into effect March 14,
did give employes more work in some cases — for exam
ple, an extra floor to do, said Helen Kelly, a Florence
Moore custodian.
However. Maravilla has promised to teach the custo
dians new cleaning techniques so they can do their work
more quickly, Kelly said.
"One day you clean thoroughly and the next day you
spot clean," said Kelly. "The dorms won't be as clean as
before, though. There's just too much to do."
Maravilla said she disagreed with Kelly's assertion
that dorms will be dirtier under the new system. In
addition, increased efficiency should mean less work tor
custodians, said Maravilla.
But the system's efficiency "can't really be judged

until we get the new system," she said.
Before the reorganization, work was unevenly di
vided, she said. "In some areas we were providing per
sonal favors — to faculty associates, for example. There
has never been a written standard. The same job title
could mean something different in each dorm."
She said her goal in reorganizing the system was to
equalize the service for all students.
Reactions
The custodians' reactions to the reorganization range
from positive to negative.
Lagunita custodian Sawae.Jefferson said. "There is
more work to do and it's very hard to get it all done. It's
very tough to scrub and we have to throw away the trash
now too. It was better before when the men threw it
away."
"When we are short of employes," she commented,
"we can't do a very good job." She said she knew others
who were also unhappy.
One advantage of the new system, according to Flor
ence Moore custodian Thora Unruh (Jackie), is that "if
one person is sick we don't have to go over and do their
work. We have the utility crew now."
Unruh also said since Florence Moore got a new
supervisor, Lottie Kirk, "things are better than they've
been in years." (The number of supervisors was reduced
from eight to four about a month ago; Kirk now super
vises Florence Moore in addition to Roble and Lagunita.)
Too soon
The custodians all agreed, however, that it was too
soon to know for sure if the changes will work.
Verbera said he was very disturbed with the way
Maravilla made the changes. According to Verbera, the
custodians were not informed of the management's
plans until just before the changes went into effect. Ver
bera said when he questioned Maravilla over a month
ago, she said there would be no changes.
He said he thought she must have known about the
pending changes but "was trying to avoid the union's
involvement. She tried to deprive employes of the right
to be represented."
After hearing the rumor of the upcoming changes.
Verbera said he made several attempts to arrange a meet
ing between Maravilla and his constituents, but
Maravilla refused.
Maravilla explained she avoided meeting Verbera be
cause she hadn't finalized plans enough to discuss them.

Much of the custodian work now performed by individual residence
cleaning staffs is being transfered to a newly instituted Project Crew.
The Crew, designed to improve housekeeping efficiency, will handle
heavy duty cleaning and serve as a pool from which absent workers
may be replaced.

Much of the custodian work now performed by individual residence
cleaning staffs is being transfered to a newly instituted Project Crew.
The Crew, designed to improve housekeeping efficiency, will handle
heavy duty cleaning and serve as a pool from which absent workers
may be replaced.
In an effort to improve the efficiency and quality of
custodial services here, the University has created a Pro
ject Crew whose members will fill in for absent employes
and do the more specialized cleaning, according to
Lucille Maravilla, assistant manager of residences,
housekeeping services.
Project Crew members are custodians who were previ
ously assigned to specific dormitories. The creation of
the crew has led to a reduction in the number of custo
dians assigned to Lagunita, Stern and Wilbur. However,
the staff size has not changed, said Maravilla.
"1 just reorganized the work distribution." she said.
"I'm not terminating anyone."
The Project Crew will serve as a pool from which
temporary substitutes for absent employes will betaken,
said Maravilla. Crew members will also do the more
specialized cleaning jobs such as window washing, rug
shampooing, floor stripping, buffing and waxing, she
said.
The decision to reorganize the custodial service was
made after the rising cost of cleaning equipment and
products (the prices of some products rose BO to 70 per
cent during the past year) prompted the administration
to ask for an examination of the custodial service, said
Maravilla.
"When the employes initially learned ot Maravilla's
plans to reorganize, they were worried they'd be given
more work," said Rafael Verbera, the United Stanford
Employees steward representing Florence Moore and
Row House custodians.
Some work more
The reorganization, which went into effect March 14,
did give employes more work in some cases — for exam
ple, an extra floor to do, said Helen Kelly, a Florence
Moore custodian.
However. Maravilla has promised to teach the custo
dians new cleaning techniques so they can do their work
more quickly, Kelly said.
"One day you clean thoroughly and the next day you
spot clean," said Kelly. "The dorms won't be as clean as
before, though. There's just too much to do."
Maravilla said she disagreed with Kelly's assertion
that dorms will be dirtier under the new system. In
addition, increased efficiency should mean less work tor
custodians, said Maravilla.
But the system's efficiency "can't really be judged

until we get the new system," she said.
Before the reorganization, work was unevenly di
vided, she said. "In some areas we were providing per
sonal favors — to faculty associates, for example. There
has never been a written standard. The same job title
could mean something different in each dorm."
She said her goal in reorganizing the system was to
equalize the service for all students.
Reactions
The custodians' reactions to the reorganization range
from positive to negative.
Lagunita custodian Sawae.Jefferson said. "There is
more work to do and it's very hard to get it all done. It's
very tough to scrub and we have to throw away the trash
now too. It was better before when the men threw it
away."
"When we are short of employes," she commented,
"we can't do a very good job." She said she knew others
who were also unhappy.
One advantage of the new system, according to Flor
ence Moore custodian Thora Unruh (Jackie), is that "if
one person is sick we don't have to go over and do their
work. We have the utility crew now."
Unruh also said since Florence Moore got a new
supervisor, Lottie Kirk, "things are better than they've
been in years." (The number of supervisors was reduced
from eight to four about a month ago; Kirk now super
vises Florence Moore in addition to Roble and Lagunita.)
Too soon
The custodians all agreed, however, that it was too
soon to know for sure if the changes will work.
Verbera said he was very disturbed with the way
Maravilla made the changes. According to Verbera, the
custodians were not informed of the management's
plans until just before the changes went into effect. Ver
bera said when he questioned Maravilla over a month
ago, she said there would be no changes.
He said he thought she must have known about the
pending changes but "was trying to avoid the union's
involvement. She tried to deprive employes of the right
to be represented."
After hearing the rumor of the upcoming changes.
Verbera said he made several attempts to arrange a meet
ing between Maravilla and his constituents, but
Maravilla refused.
Maravilla explained she avoided meeting Verbera be
cause she hadn't finalized plans enough to discuss them.
