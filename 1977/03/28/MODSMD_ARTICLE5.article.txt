### Randy Keith 
Phillip Petersen, director of the lan
guage laboratory in Meyer Library and
a lecturer in the Spanish and Por
tuguese Department, has been fired
from both jobs following his arrest on
three counts of grand theft
embezzlement involving about
$62,000.
Provost William Miller said Peter
sen was discharged last Monday under
the academic staff discharging proce
dures outlined in the University's
Guide to Administrative Organization
Policies and Procedures. The dis
charge was effective immediately.
When asked to explain how the pro
cedure applied to Petersen's case Mil
ler said "in general we don't comment
on these things because it might pre
judice his case."
I he Guide states that "an employe
shall not be discharged except for just
cause, which may include unsatisfac
tory performance or misconduct or
both."
Marvin Herrington, director of the
Department of Public Safety, said
Petersen allegedly embezzled approx
imately $62,000 by turning in receipts
saying he had purchased items for the
University when he actually hadn't.

The money was paid out of a petty cash
fund that Petersen was authorized to
use.
Herrington said that a routine audit
led to a 2V2-week investigation that
ended with Petersen's arrest Thurs
day, March 17.
Most of the receipts that Petersen al
legedly used were from a camera store
in San Mateo, Herrington said. He said
the camera store threw out old receipts
at the end of a day and that Petersen
allegedly picked them up and turned
them in for reimbursement. Her
rington added that it appeared that no

body working for the store was in
volved.
"A substantial amount of property
bought by the University for Univer
sity purposes" was seized when police
searched Petersen's San Mateo home
following his arrest, according to Uer
rington. He said that information
about the University property had
been turned over to the district attor
ney's office for review.
Petersen was released on his own
recognizance after being booked at the
North County jail following his arrest.
A preliminary hearing has been set for
April 5 in Superior Court in Palo Alto.
