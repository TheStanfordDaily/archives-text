# ASSU pay hinges on fee assessment
## 
### Jill Liscom 
The ASSU Senate has approved a
by-law amendment making salaries of
Council of Presidents (COP) members
and ASSU senate officers contingent
upon a fee assessment to be placed on
the spring ballot.
The resolution was revised, after
being passed by the senate and vetoed
by COP President Vic Petroff, to in
clude the stipulation that "those new
COP members and senate officers who
feel the need for financial aid shall be
entitled to a stipend provided out of
ASSU funds" of up to $750 per quarter.
The amendment was passed by a
vote of 11 to 4 with 2 abstentions at the
senate's March 7 meeting.
According to Sen. Kick Morrow,
who submitted the amendment, the
main purpose of the bill is "to give the
students the chance to decide if they
want to pay their COP." He also em
phasized that "this is one of the most
important things the senate has gone
through this quarter."
'Political issue'
In a memorandum to the senators,
Sen. John Paval recommended abs
taining from voting, claiming the
proposed amendment had become
"more of a political issue than an ad
ministrative reform."
He also wrote, "We cannot submit
the salaries of officials to a vote of the
students, when we ourselves have not
yet decided on the proposed changes
in the functions and responsibilities of
those officials."
Petroff said the COP will "take no
formal action on the amendment. It
seems like this move is one that most of
t lie senate wants to take. A veto would
never stick."
The new proposal is "a much more
workable piece of legislation than be
fore," said Petroff.
Petroff cautioned, however, that
"there is some difference in how the
financial aids office and the senate see
the amendment. The bill is not un
workable, but there may be some prob
lems."
Also at the March 7 meeting, Sen.
Dave Sharp was elected ASSU senate
chairman, replacing former Senate
Chairman Pat Hall who had submitted
his resignation the previous week.
Under the normal succession proce
dure, Deputy Chairman Brad Krevoy
would serve as chairman for the re
mainder of the school vear. However,

the senate voted to suspend the rules
in order to hold an election for a new
chairman.
Sharp said he thinks this quar
ter "the senate is going to deal with a
lot of internal housekeeping resolu
tions" and "is going to take a larger
and larger role in getting student input
into University issues."
Good for senate
Krevoy commented, "I think it's in
the best interests of the senate to have a
senior who had a great deal of time,
experience and leadership to devote
this spring quarter. 1 also think Dave
will be in a better position to deal more
successfully with the antics of Ham
mer & Coffin."
The senate also voted to place re
quests for a $1 fee assessment on the
spring bal lot for the Academic Organi
zation Board, ASSU Legal Counseling
Office, Guest Professorship Board and
ASSU Course Guide, based on recom
mendations from the ASSU Finance
committee.
The Academic Organization Board
is a new group created to coordinate
the activities of academically-oriented
student organizations such as
Stanford-in-Government, the Black
Pre-Law Society and the Biology
Bridge.
Representatives from KZSU also at
tended the meeting to ask that KZSU's
fee assessment request be placed on
the spring ballot. In order to meet the
deadline set for spring ballot fee as
sessments, the senate tentatively ap
proved the request. The decision will
be reviewed at the next senate meeting
after the finance committee has
evaluated KZSU's budget and expen
ditures.
