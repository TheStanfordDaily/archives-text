### 
Police say all leads have been
exhausted and there are no suspects in
this year's first reported campus rape
which occurred in broad daylight dur
ing finals week.
A 26-year-old student said she was
threatened with a knife and raped at
approximately 2:30 p.m. March 18 in a
wooded area between Palm Drive and
the Mausoleum, according to Marvin
Herri ngton, director of the Department
of Public Safety.
Herrington said the woman reported
she was walking along the path bor
dering Palm Drive, between Ar
boretum Road and Campus Drive,
when the rapist, who had been follow
ing her, brandished a knife, forced her
into the bushes and raped her.
Herrington said the case was "frus
trating" because the attack occurred
on a Friday afternoon in a busy section
of campus only a few minutes after
patrol cars had been in the area.
The victim described the rapist as a
white male, about 5-feet, 10-inches in
his mid-20s, with brown frizzy hair, a
pot belly and an unshaven moon-like
face.
The rapist was wearing blue jeans
and a sweat shirt with the words
"Brown University" in blue letters and
the schools emblem printed on it, ac
cording to Detective Sgt. Ray Pantiga
of the Santa Clara Sheriff's Depart
ment.
The victim said the attacker was
wearing "earth shoes," Pantiga said.
Herrington said the victim reported
she had been walking along the bike
path and had stopped at the stoplight
at the intersection of Palm Drive and
Arboretum Road when the rapist first
appeared. After the light changed, the
victim crossed the street and was fol
lowed along the path about 2/3 of the
way towards Campus Drive. At that
point, the rapist forced her off the pat h,
according to Herrington.
According to Pantiga, the victim
said she was warned not to scream and
she complied because "she thought he
would kill her."
The rapist identified himself as
"Rick" and "indicated he lived in the
area and said he was going home to go
to bed (after the attack)," Pantiga said
the victim reported.
Pantiga added, "she thought he was
psychotic" because he seemed intelli
gent at times and "seemed like a nut"
at others.
