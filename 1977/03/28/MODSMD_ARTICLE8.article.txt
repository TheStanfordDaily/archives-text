## Regulation kills competition 
### 
The recent controversy over state
imposed minimum liquor prices illus
trates a darker side of the tree enter
prise system — industries seeking
government regulation. The recently
repealed "Fair Trade" laws (which al
lowed manufacturers to set prices) cost
consumers billions of dollars since
their inception during the 19305. In
1975, the Federal Trade Commission
(PTC) estimated that consumers are
annually losing $150-300 million be
cause of state prohibitions on advertis
ing by pharmacists. Similar laws ban
advertising by other specialties (such
as optometrists), and states promote
monopoly by restricting licensing
(contractors, TV repairmen) and by
granting permits and franchises on a
political basis. Even more outrageous
is state support of private monopoliza
tion by professionals (e.g.. legal and
medical) under the guise of "profes
sional dignity."
However, the more intractable prob
lem lies with the federal government.
Approximately $3 billion is spent each
year to support a federal regulatory
force of 74,000 — much of which is
encouraged by business. For example,
the general counsel of the airlines
lobby (ATA) commented that "on the
whole we're pretty happy wit h the sys
tem." And the Interstate Commerce
Commission, whose creation was sup
ported by the railroads, continues with
the lobbying of the Teamsters Union
and the trucking industry. When the
regulatees support their own regula
tion as being in the "public interest,"
it's time to get worried.
In the words of writer James Nathan
Miller, the "Industry has become the
tail that wags the regulatory dog." The
first problem is that regulators are not
appointed for their vigilance, but for
their knowledge of the industry —
which usually means that they come
from the industry. For example, the
newest ICC' commissioner is a former
chief lawyer for the Washington lobby
of the bus industry. The Chairman of
the FPC is a former power company
lawyer. And the head of the Federal
Maritime Commission is a former
shipping-news reporter.
Even if former industry flunkies are
not nominated, it is rare for anyone
with a pro-consumer record to be con

sidered. A Brookings Institute study
found that "Rarely does the president
appoint, and the Senate confirm, a
commissioner if the regulated indus
try is against him."
And unfortunately, non-industry
flunkies tend to become industry flun
kies through junkets and the like. One
of many instances of this sort occurred
in 1974, when the then Civil Aeronau
tics Hoard (CAB) chairman had an all
expenses paid trip to Bermuda with
numerous airlines presidents. The bill
was picked up by United Aircraft
Corp., which at the time had two cases

pending before the CAB. Reubin
Robertson 111, chief counsel for the Av
iation Consumer Action Project, noted
that "the industry people and the reg
ulators socialize and work together so
closely that eventually they talk the
same, think the same and make the
same decision."
As would be expected, these indus
try-controlled commissions wreak
havoc with the free enterprise system
— the regulated industries have be
come "protectorates, living in a cozy
world of cost plus, safely protected
from the ugly specters of competition,
efficiency and innovation" (Lewis. A.
Engman, Chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission). The Council of
Economic Advisers estimated in 1975
that regulation costs consumers at
least $14 billiona year, in terms of pure
waste, overcharges and inefficiency.
The CAB is one of the worst offen
ders. It "presides over an airline cartel.
The cartel sets fares at excessively high
levels, and then the airlines compete
away the profits by putting too many
empty seats in the air" (Theodore
keeler. Professor of Transportation
Economics, UC-Berkeley). Despite

the demonstrated effectiveness of
competition in intrastate airlines like
Southwest Airlines in Texas (doubled
travel at 25-50 per cent lower rates)
and FSA in California (tripled travel at
lower rates), the CAB continues to
"stamp out every potential competitor
to the airlines that it legally could, as
well as some that it legally couldn't"
(Professor Michael Levine, USC Law
School and Cal Tech, and a former
CAB staff member).
The CAB has failed to approve the
entry of any new trunk lines since its
creation in 1938. Since 1950 it has re
ceived 94 applications from airlines
seeking to compete with other carriers
on long-haul routes — and has rejected
them all. In 1967, World Airways, Inc.,
asked for permission to operate a
California-New York line at a little
over half the approved fare. Despite
requests from several California cities
for an "expeditious hearing," the CAB
did nothing until 1973, when it dis
missed the application as "stale."
And then there is the Interstate
Commerce Commission. Created with
the approval of the railroads, it con
tinues to support the "rip-off" of the
consumer.
The Securities Exchange Commis
sion (SEC) is in reality a stock brokers'
protection act (or as columnist
Nicholas Von Hoffman put it—at best
"a consumer protection agency for
millionaires.").
And, unfortunately, the list goes on.
As Professor Hendrick Houthakke of
Harvard, and former member of the
President's Council of Economic Ad
visers noted: "The list of industries
where the government thwarts the be
neficial action of market forces, actu
ally at the behest of trade organizations
or labor unions, is long indeed and still
growing."
We should do all within our power
to scrap this system for being, as con
sumer advocate Ralph Nader noted,
"subservient" to the industry: "After a
few years of challenging them, you
realize the system is hopelessly rig
ged." Perhaps the greatest threat to the
free enterprise system lies in a busi
ness saying "free enterprise is fine, «o
long as I don't have to compete!"

In the words of writer James Nathan
Miller, the "Industry has become the
tail that wags the regulatory dog." The
first problem is that regulators are not
appointed for their vigilance, but for
their knowledge of the industry —
which usually means that they come
from the industry. For example, the
newest ICC' commissioner is a former
chief lawyer for the Washington lobby
of the bus industry. The Chairman of
the FPC is a former power company
lawyer. And the head of the Federal
Maritime Commission is a former
shipping-news reporter.
Even if former industry flunkies are
not nominated, it is rare for anyone
with a pro-consumer record to be con

sidered. A Brookings Institute study
found that "Rarely does the president
appoint, and the Senate confirm, a
commissioner if the regulated indus
try is against him."
And unfortunately, non-industry
flunkies tend to become industry flun
kies through junkets and the like. One
of many instances of this sort occurred
in 1974, when the then Civil Aeronau
tics Hoard (CAB) chairman had an all
expenses paid trip to Bermuda with
numerous airlines presidents. The bill
was picked up by United Aircraft
Corp., which at the time had two cases

pending before the CAB. Reubin
Robertson 111, chief counsel for the Av
iation Consumer Action Project, noted
that "the industry people and the reg
ulators socialize and work together so
closely that eventually they talk the
same, think the same and make the
same decision."
As would be expected, these indus
try-controlled commissions wreak
havoc with the free enterprise system
— the regulated industries have be
come "protectorates, living in a cozy
world of cost plus, safely protected
from the ugly specters of competition,
efficiency and innovation" (Lewis. A.
Engman, Chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission). The Council of
Economic Advisers estimated in 1975
that regulation costs consumers at
least $14 billiona year, in terms of pure
waste, overcharges and inefficiency.
The CAB is one of the worst offen
ders. It "presides over an airline cartel.
The cartel sets fares at excessively high
levels, and then the airlines compete
away the profits by putting too many
empty seats in the air" (Theodore
keeler. Professor of Transportation
Economics, UC-Berkeley). Despite

the demonstrated effectiveness of
competition in intrastate airlines like
Southwest Airlines in Texas (doubled
travel at 25-50 per cent lower rates)
and FSA in California (tripled travel at
lower rates), the CAB continues to
"stamp out every potential competitor
to the airlines that it legally could, as
well as some that it legally couldn't"
(Professor Michael Levine, USC Law
School and Cal Tech, and a former
CAB staff member).
The CAB has failed to approve the
entry of any new trunk lines since its
creation in 1938. Since 1950 it has re
ceived 94 applications from airlines
seeking to compete with other carriers
on long-haul routes — and has rejected
them all. In 1967, World Airways, Inc.,
asked for permission to operate a
California-New York line at a little
over half the approved fare. Despite
requests from several California cities
for an "expeditious hearing," the CAB
did nothing until 1973, when it dis
missed the application as "stale."
And then there is the Interstate
Commerce Commission. Created with
the approval of the railroads, it con
tinues to support the "rip-off" of the
consumer.
The Securities Exchange Commis
sion (SEC) is in reality a stock brokers'
protection act (or as columnist
Nicholas Von Hoffman put it—at best
"a consumer protection agency for
millionaires.").
And, unfortunately, the list goes on.
As Professor Hendrick Houthakke of
Harvard, and former member of the
President's Council of Economic Ad
visers noted: "The list of industries
where the government thwarts the be
neficial action of market forces, actu
ally at the behest of trade organizations
or labor unions, is long indeed and still
growing."
We should do all within our power
to scrap this system for being, as con

"subservient" to the industry: "After a

The recent controversy over state
imposed minimum liquor prices illus
trates a darker side of the tree enter
prise system — industries seeking
government regulation. The recently
repealed "Fair Trade" laws (which al
lowed manufacturers to set prices) cost
consumers billions of dollars since
their inception during the 19305. In
1975, the Federal Trade Commission
(PTC) estimated that consumers are
annually losing $150-300 million be
cause of state prohibitions on advertis
ing by pharmacists. Similar laws ban
advertising by other specialties (such
as optometrists), and states promote
monopoly by restricting licensing
(contractors, TV repairmen) and by
granting permits and franchises on a
political basis. Even more outrageous
is state support of private monopoliza
tion by professionals (e.g.. legal and
medical) under the guise of "profes
sional dignity."
However, the more intractable prob
lem lies with the federal government.
Approximately $3 billion is spent each
year to support a federal regulatory
force of 74,000 — much of which is
encouraged by business. For example,
the general counsel of the airlines
lobby (ATA) commented that "on the
whole we're pretty happy wit h the sys
tem." And the Interstate Commerce

the lobbying of the Teamsters Union

As would be expected, these indus
try-controlled commissions wreak
havoc with the free enterprise system
— the regulated industries have be
come "protectorates, living in a cozy
world of cost plus, safely protected
from the ugly specters of competition,
efficiency and innovation" (Lewis. A.
Engman, Chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission). The Council of
Economic Advisers estimated in 1975
that regulation costs consumers at
least $14 billiona year, in terms of pure
waste, overcharges and inefficiency.
The CAB is one of the worst offen
ders. It "presides over an airline cartel.
The cartel sets fares at excessively high
levels, and then the airlines compete
away the profits by putting too many
empty seats in the air" (Theodore
keeler. Professor of Transportation
Economics, UC-Berkeley). Despite

the demonstrated effectiveness of
competition in intrastate airlines like
Southwest Airlines in Texas (doubled
travel at 25-50 per cent lower rates)
and FSA in California (tripled travel at
lower rates), the CAB continues to
"stamp out every potential competitor
to the airlines that it legally could, as
well as some that it legally couldn't"
(Professor Michael Levine, USC Law
School and Cal Tech, and a former
CAB staff member).
The CAB has failed to approve the
entry of any new trunk lines since its
creation in 1938. Since 1950 it has re
ceived 94 applications from airlines
seeking to compete with other carriers
on long-haul routes — and has rejected
them all. In 1967, World Airways, Inc.,
asked for permission to operate a
California-New York line at a little
over half the approved fare. Despite
requests from several California cities
for an "expeditious hearing," the CAB
did nothing until 1973, when it dis
missed the application as "stale."
And then there is the Interstate
Commerce Commission. Created with
the approval of the railroads, it con
tinues to support the "rip-off" of the
consumer.
The Securities Exchange Commis
sion (SEC) is in reality a stock brokers'
protection act (or as columnist
Nicholas Von Hoffman put it—at best
"a consumer protection agency for
millionaires.").
And, unfortunately, the list goes on.
As Professor Hendrick Houthakke of
Harvard, and former member of the
President's Council of Economic Ad
visers noted: "The list of industries
where the government thwarts the be
neficial action of market forces, actu
ally at the behest of trade organizations
or labor unions, is long indeed and still
growing."
We should do all within our power
to scrap this system for being, as con
sumer advocate Ralph Nader noted,
"subservient" to the industry: "After a
few years of challenging them, you
realize the system is hopelessly rig
ged." Perhaps the greatest threat to the
free enterprise system lies in a busi
ness saying "free enterprise is fine, «o
long as I don't have to compete!"

The recent controversy over state
imposed minimum liquor prices illus
trates a darker side of the tree enter
prise system — industries seeking
government regulation. The recently
repealed "Fair Trade" laws (which al
lowed manufacturers to set prices) cost
consumers billions of dollars since
their inception during the 19305. In
1975, the Federal Trade Commission
(PTC) estimated that consumers are
annually losing $150-300 million be
cause of state prohibitions on advertis
ing by pharmacists. Similar laws ban
advertising by other specialties (such
as optometrists), and states promote
monopoly by restricting licensing
(contractors, TV repairmen) and by
granting permits and franchises on a
political basis. Even more outrageous
is state support of private monopoliza
tion by professionals (e.g.. legal and
medical) under the guise of "profes
sional dignity."
However, the more intractable prob
lem lies with the federal government.
Approximately $3 billion is spent each
year to support a federal regulatory
force of 74,000 — much of which is
encouraged by business. For example,
the general counsel of the airlines
lobby (ATA) commented that "on the
whole we're pretty happy wit h the sys
tem." And the Interstate Commerce
Commission, whose creation was sup
ported by the railroads, continues with
the lobbying of the Teamsters Union
and the trucking industry. When the
regulatees support their own regula
tion as being in the "public interest,"
it's time to get worried.
In the words of writer James Nathan
Miller, the "Industry has become the
tail that wags the regulatory dog." The
first problem is that regulators are not
appointed for their vigilance, but for
their knowledge of the industry —
which usually means that they come
from the industry. For example, the
newest ICC' commissioner is a former
chief lawyer for the Washington lobby
of the bus industry. The Chairman of
the FPC is a former power company
lawyer. And the head of the Federal
Maritime Commission is a former
shipping-news reporter.
Even if former industry flunkies are
not nominated, it is rare for anyone
with a pro-consumer record to be con

sidered. A Brookings Institute study
found that "Rarely does the president
appoint, and the Senate confirm, a
commissioner if the regulated indus
try is against him."
And unfortunately, non-industry
flunkies tend to become industry flun
kies through junkets and the like. One
of many instances of this sort occurred
in 1974, when the then Civil Aeronau
tics Hoard (CAB) chairman had an all
expenses paid trip to Bermuda with
numerous airlines presidents. The bill
was picked up by United Aircraft
Corp., which at the time had two cases

pending before the CAB. Reubin
Robertson 111, chief counsel for the Av
iation Consumer Action Project, noted
that "the industry people and the reg
ulators socialize and work together so
closely that eventually they talk the
same, think the same and make the
same decision."

try-controlled commissions wreak
