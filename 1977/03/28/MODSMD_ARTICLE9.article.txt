# Join fight against Bakke ruling
## 
### 
Hansch, Moonshine

How can we fight for preservation of
minority admissions when so many
racist policies persist at Stan
ford? The Stanford Coalition Against
the Bakke Decision encourages the
student body to realize that the absur
dity of the California Supreme Court's
decision on the Bakke case is only in
cremental when viewed as only one
instance of the perpetuation and pro
liferation of acts and policies of dis
crimination.
What would be the point of increas
ing minority enrollment, when the
administration may not allow con
tinuation of the Chicano Affairs Of
fice?
How can President Lyman say that
he fears the consequences of the possi
ble upholding of the Bakke decision by
the U.S. Supreme Court on broad
grounds when the admissions office at

Stanford is committed to perpetuating
the elite structure of society and
CIJAFA cannot overcome the subtle
racism of Dean Hargadon?
How can the University be commit
ted to progress, and leading society
when minority admissions will be re
gressed by self-help price increases?
What can third world peoples think
of a campus which includes active
marine recruitment (week after next)
when the marines permit and encour
age ku Klux Klan organizing on bases
such as Camp Pendleton?
Why would minority students de
grade themselves to want to be part of
an institution which owns stock in
corporations such as J.P. Stevens and
others which operate in South Africa
and Chile?
How can this University even pay
lip service to ideals when it pursues

discriminatory labor practices?
Indeed, Stanford University, much
like UC-Davis, cannot even recognize,
admit and deal with its own history of
minority repression.
As evidenced by the administra
tion's handling of the J.P. Stevens
campus struggle, small-scale inde
pendently organized pressure on the
administration will not succeed. Au
gsburger, Miller and Lyman ignored
obvious and massive community sup
port for the second resolution and es
sentially ignored the moral determina
tion demonstrated by participants in
the sit-in.
A broad-based united front, there
fore, is necessary for future actions.
Whereas many independent progres
sive and third world organizations are
presently dedicated to contemporary
issues, it is still crucial that they occa

sionally unite when applying pressure
and gaining mass publicity.
A strong list of independent but sig
nificantly interrelated demands
should be supported and fought for
simultaneously by all these groups.
There is no doubt that recent coop
eration and, especially, communica
tion between third world peoples has
been but a fraction of the potential
which exists to unite and reinstate true
progress toward civil rights and
societal reform as a product of this in
stitution.
This spring will bea new beginning.
Let there be no doubt about it: the re
volution will come.
