Maybe we'll
cure cancer
without your
help,
but don't bet
your life on it.
The way it stands today,
one American out of four
will someday have cancer
That means it will strike
some member in two out
of three American families.
To change those statistics
we have to bring the
promise ol research to
everyday reality And to
expand our detection
program and techniques.
And thai takes money Lots
of money. Money we won't
have —unless you help us
The American Cancer
Society will never give up
the light Maybe we'll
find the answers even
without your help
Hut don't bet your
life on it

Cancer Society 112
