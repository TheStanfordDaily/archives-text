MEMO:
TO YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHERS
SUBJECT:
TURNING YOUR CAMERA INWARD
When we talk of "turning your camera
inward," we do not mean self-portraits. We
want to see publishable photographs that
show (without the need of words) what is
distinctive about your college, your
relationships or any other areas of your life.
What are the pictures of the 1970'5?
We are planning a Special Report of LIFE
describing the way young people live in
the 1970'5.
If you have good photographs taken this
school year or feel you can make a revealing
contribution by May, write as soon as
possible to Radio City Box 624 New York,
N.Y. 10019 and we will send you details.
