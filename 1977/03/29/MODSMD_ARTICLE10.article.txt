# Report 'solid base' for evaluations

Petroff et al.

In our last column we discussed the
need for universal course evaluation,
as prescribed by Recommendation I in
the ASSU Task Force Report on Te
nure and Teaching Quality. We now
focus on the other four recommenda
tions in the task force report.
These five recommendations to
gether would provide a solid base for
the evaluation of teaching at Stanford.
We feel it is in Stanford's interest to
adopt them.
Recommendation II states that "re
trospective surveys conducted among
seniors and recent alumni are needed
to assess the long-term value of
courses and of advising." The task
force realizes that universal course
evaluation is not the only way to con
sider teaching quality, and that other
viable means of evaluation exist.
Recommendation II is intended to
supplement available information on
the teaching quality of a particular
candidate for promotion or salary in
crease. The task force reasons that
seniors and recent alumni are in a
favorable position to thoughtfully
consider the teaching and advising
quality of Stanford faculty.
Given the advantage of having ex
perienced a wide-range of Stanford
professors and courses, the recent
alumni or graduating seniors may well
be able to make valuable comments on
teaching/advising quality that might

go unnoticed in the regular course
evaluation. This recommendation
should also reduce concern among fa
culty that student course evaluations
may reflect the popularity of the
course subject and the showmanship
of the lecturer.
New committee
Recommendation 111 states that "A
new committee of the Academic Se
nate is needed for the comparative as
sessment of teaching in the Schools of
Humanities and Sciences. Earth Sci
ences, and Engineering." This com
mittee would be composed of stu
dents, faculty, and a member of the
Provost's staff (with faculty members
in the majority). Each year, the com
mittee would be responsible for re
viewing both the retrospective student
assessments and past course evalua
tion data, then it would write a confi
dential summary of each candidate for
promotion and tenure. This written
summary would be sent to the candi
date's department so that those re
sponsible for a departmental recom
mendation will have comprehensive
information on the candidate's teach
ing quality.
This system would provide sym
metry between the processes currently
used to evaluate research and teach
ing. As the task force notes, "De
partmental reviewers would be able to
consider outside comparative assess

ments of both teaching and research,
along with their own evaluations of
their colleague's work in both areas,
and the course evaluation data and in
formation already available in the fol
der." Approximately 40 assessments
would have to be undertaken each
academic year.
Teaching awards
Recommendation IV is directly re
lated to the formation of the standing
committee since it suggests that "the
new standing committee on teaching
evaluation select a certain number of
professors each year to receive teach
ing awards." We commend Dean
Royden for his adoption of the teach
ing awards in H&S this year, but agree
with the task force recommendation
that an award system be expanded to
include the three schools with under
graduate instruction. As the task force

notes, the standing committee would
be "particularly well suited to award
these prizes, relying heavily on vari
ous kinds of student evaluations, and
on whatever peer evaluation the de
partments feel would be appropriate
for the committee to consider."
Recommendation V asks that "it be
university policy that every search
committee gather as detailed an ap
praisal as possible of the teaching
quality of the candidates they are con
sidering for a faculty appointment."
This would alleviate concern among
students that appointments are made
without consideration of teaching
quality, and seems in accordance with
appointments policy statements is
sued by the three schools with under
graduates.
