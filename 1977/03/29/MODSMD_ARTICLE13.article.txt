# Marijuana and the coffee, tobacco connection
## 
### Jacueline Thompson 
Picture a young man standing
in the doorway of an apartment.
In his pocket, he carries a small
burlap sack just large enough to
fit in the palm of his hand.
As he is about to ring the bell,
two dark figures appear. One
seizes the burlap bag. It contains
four ounces of a fine blend of
Turkish coffee beans. The other,
producing identification says,
"You're under arrest for posses
sion of a controlled substance."
The scene actually could have
taken place in Rome during the
papacy of Clement VIII at the end
of the sixteenth century. At that
time, coffee was considered "the

drink of the devil." The young
man would have been brought
before a magistrate, probably
sentenced to a long sojourn in a
penal colony on the West Coast
of Africa, and excommunicated
from the Church.
F'ar-fetched as it may seem, the
prohibition against coffee — and
a century later against tobacco —
was enforced more harshly than
the current laws against
marijuana in the United States.
Compared to the Chinese, smok
ers here have it easy. Anyone
who trafficked in tobacco risked
decapitation under decree of
1638. Russian officers were de
ported to Siberia, where the

Czars submitted them to torture
and even death.
There are startling parallels
between the history of coffee and
tobacco and that of marijuana in
this country. Bans on these sub
stances usually came about be
cause large economic interests
pressured authorities to outlaw
products which appeared to
threaten their commercial well
being. In France during the
seventeenth century, for in
stance, wine merchants and
grape growers united in an effort
to limit the importation of coffee,
believing that its wide accep
tance would destroy the wine
business.

Similarly, tobacco interests in
this country lobbied tor the Fed
eral Uniform Narcotics and
Marijuana Tax Act which passed
in 1937 —after nearly 50 years of
perfectly acceptable use. Appa
rently, the delights of cannabis
represented too great a threat to
the established tobacco indus
try.
Criminalization has backfired,
however. Since 1956 when the
most severe federal penalities
were enacted, marijuana usage
has skyrocketed, especially
among young adults. A study
done in the spring of 1976 by the
National Institute on Drug
Abuse reveals that 13 million

Americans or eight per cent of
the total population are current
marijuana smokers. Specifically,
53 per cent of young adults,
18-25 years old, have smoked at
one time, and fully 25 per cent of
this age group are regular users.
Among the teenagers, 12-17,
nearly a quarter, both male and
female, have experimented with
"pot" at one time or another. It's
estimated 48 per cent of today's
college students have ex
perimented with grass, and 24
per cent are current users.
According to a Daily survey
taken in November, approxi
mately 55 per cent of the stu
dents here use marijuana —
seven percent higher than the
national average. Most of those
polled indicated that their usage
had increased since coming to
school (with 27 per cent stating
that their intake had more than
doubled).
Only 10 per cent of those pol
led indicated that their usage
had dropped.
Professor Irving Goffman,
chairman of the Department of
Economics at the University of
Florida, who is considered an
expert in the economics of
marijuana, estimated the total re
tail sales in the country in 1974
at about $3.5 billion. "Five vears
from now, when 1 think it will be
decriminalized everywhere, 1
think it will be $5 billion —
maybe $10 billion if you don't
account for inflation," he said.
Already eight states, begin
ning with Oregon in 1973, have
enacted modified forms of de
criminalization. Alaska has
legalized use by individuals in
their homes. Citing the influence
of enlightened public opinion,
Keith Stroup, the executive di

rector of the National Organiza
tion for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML), is optimistic
about the future of the reform
drive. "After all, for the first time
in our history, we have a presi
dent (Carter) who favors de
criminalization," he said.
Other signs of the changing
times are the creation and
growth of legitimate businesses
which serve the marijuana
smoker. They produce such
paraphernalia as pipes, incense,
hookahs, rolling paper,
machines that roll "joints" and
remove the seeds from the weed,
small spring scales, test kits,
frisk-proof money belts for hid
ing one's "stash," and plastic
storage bags with an appropriate
marijuana leaf design. The
paraphernalia trade has become
big business, currently esti
mated to be worth over $200
million a year in retail trade.
One segment of the economy
which has felt the impact is the
cigarette paper industry. For
years, it had ambled along serving
the needs of the classic Bull
Durham smoker and the occa
sional maverick who liked to roll
his own. Then the discovery of
grass by the 1960s anti-war gen
eration revived the languishing
industry, gave it a rapidly ex
panding market — and unex
pected competition from a new
breed of capitalists who saw the
profit in pot papers.
In 1972, "E-Z Wider" re
volutionzed the staid, old indus
try by inventing a high-quality,
slower-burning paper in a wider

size. It was the first company to
produce rolling paper expressly
for the "new smoker" and in
1976, Americans purchased over
30 million packs of E-Z Wider,
nearly one billion "joints."
With new companies entering
the field all the time, the
paraphernalia business is be
coming more competitive. This
summer, it was rumored that the
giants of the tobacco industry
were shooting for a piece of the
action. Columnist Jack Ander
son reported that corporate rep
resentatives were quietly lobby
ing for the legalization of
marijuana, while, back at com
pany headquarters, executives
were secretly setting aside
"choice Southern land for future
marijuana harvests," registering
trademarks on brand names
"lifted straight from marijuana
street lingo," and "making pro
duction plans " The companies
of course, deny these reports.
But advanced planning and
professional management are
not just the province of these
old-line companies. Advanced
marketing principles, MBA'd
managers, and computerized
systems, are precisely the reason
that the young firms, such as E-Z
Wider, have been able to com
pete against entrenched estab
lished corporations.
The way things are going
don't be surprised if you find
yourself signing up to be inter
viewed by one of these "new
smoker" companies through the
college placement office one day
soon.

maybe $10 billion if you don't
account for inflation," he said.
Already eight states, begin
ning with Oregon in 1973, have
enacted modified forms of de
criminalization. Alaska has
legalized use by individuals in
their homes. Citing the influence
of enlightened public opinion,
Keith Stroup, the executive di

rector of the National Organiza
tion for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML), is optimistic
about the future of the reform
drive. "After all, for the first time
in our history, we have a presi
dent (Carter) who favors de
criminalization," he said.
Other signs of the changing
times are the creation and
growth of legitimate businesses
which serve the marijuana
smoker. They produce such
paraphernalia as pipes, incense,
hookahs, rolling paper,
machines that roll "joints" and
remove the seeds from the weed,
small spring scales, test kits,
frisk-proof money belts for hid
ing one's "stash," and plastic
storage bags with an appropriate
marijuana leaf design. The
paraphernalia trade has become
big business, currently esti
mated to be worth over $200
million a year in retail trade.
One segment of the economy
which has felt the impact is the
cigarette paper industry. For
years, it had ambled along serving
the needs of the classic Bull
Durham smoker and the occa
sional maverick who liked to roll
his own. Then the discovery of
grass by the 1960s anti-war gen
eration revived the languishing
industry, gave it a rapidly ex
panding market — and unex
pected competition from a new
breed of capitalists who saw the
profit in pot papers.
In 1972, "E-Z Wider" re
volutionzed the staid, old indus
try by inventing a high-quality,
slower-burning paper in a wider

size. It was the first company to
produce rolling paper expressly
for the "new smoker" and in
1976, Americans purchased over
30 million packs of E-Z Wider,
nearly one billion "joints."
With new companies entering
the field all the time, the
paraphernalia business is be
coming more competitive. This
summer, it was rumored that the
giants of the tobacco industry
were shooting for a piece of the
action. Columnist Jack Ander
son reported that corporate rep
resentatives were quietly lobby
ing for the legalization of
marijuana, while, back at com
pany headquarters, executives
were secretly setting aside
"choice Southern land for future
marijuana harvests," registering
trademarks on brand names
"lifted straight from marijuana
street lingo," and "making pro
duction plans " The companies
of course, deny these reports.
But advanced planning and
professional management are
not just the province of these
old-line companies. Advanced
marketing principles, MBA'd
managers, and computerized
systems, are precisely the reason
that the young firms, such as E-Z
Wider, have been able to com
pete against entrenched estab
lished corporations.
The way things are going
don't be surprised if you find
yourself signing up to be inter
viewed by one of these "new
smoker" companies through the
college placement office one day
soon.
Picture a young man standing
in the doorway of an apartment.
In his pocket, he carries a small
burlap sack just large enough to
fit in the palm of his hand.
As he is about to ring the bell,
two dark figures appear. One
seizes the burlap bag. It contains
four ounces of a fine blend of
Turkish coffee beans. The other,
producing identification says,
"You're under arrest for posses
sion of a controlled substance."
The scene actually could have
taken place in Rome during the
papacy of Clement VIII at the end
of the sixteenth century. At that
time, coffee was considered "the

drink of the devil." The young
man would have been brought
before a magistrate, probably
sentenced to a long sojourn in a
penal colony on the West Coast
of Africa, and excommunicated
from the Church.
F'ar-fetched as it may seem, the
prohibition against coffee — and
a century later against tobacco —
was enforced more harshly than
the current laws against
marijuana in the United States.
Compared to the Chinese, smok
ers here have it easy. Anyone
who trafficked in tobacco risked
decapitation under decree of
1638. Russian officers were de
ported to Siberia, where the

Czars submitted them to torture
and even death.
There are startling parallels
between the history of coffee and
tobacco and that of marijuana in
this country. Bans on these sub
stances usually came about be
cause large economic interests
pressured authorities to outlaw
products which appeared to
threaten their commercial well
being. In France during the
seventeenth century, for in
stance, wine merchants and
grape growers united in an effort
to limit the importation of coffee,
believing that its wide accep
tance would destroy the wine
business.

Similarly, tobacco interests in
this country lobbied tor the Fed
eral Uniform Narcotics and
Marijuana Tax Act which passed
in 1937 —after nearly 50 years of
perfectly acceptable use. Appa
rently, the delights of cannabis
represented too great a threat to
the established tobacco indus
try.
Criminalization has backfired,
however. Since 1956 when the
most severe federal penalities
were enacted, marijuana usage
has skyrocketed, especially
among young adults. A study
done in the spring of 1976 by the
National Institute on Drug
Abuse reveals that 13 million

Americans or eight per cent of
the total population are current
marijuana smokers. Specifically,
53 per cent of young adults,
18-25 years old, have smoked at
one time, and fully 25 per cent of
this age group are regular users.
Among the teenagers, 12-17,
nearly a quarter, both male and
female, have experimented with
"pot" at one time or another. It's
estimated 48 per cent of today's
college students have ex
perimented with grass, and 24
per cent are current users.
According to a Daily survey
taken in November, approxi
mately 55 per cent of the stu
dents here use marijuana —
seven percent higher than the
national average. Most of those
polled indicated that their usage
had increased since coming to
school (with 27 per cent stating
that their intake had more than
doubled).
Only 10 per cent of those pol
led indicated that their usage
had dropped.
Professor Irving Goffman,
chairman of the Department of
Economics at the University of
Florida, who is considered an
expert in the economics of
marijuana, estimated the total re
tail sales in the country in 1974
at about $3.5 billion. "Five vears
from now, when 1 think it will be
decriminalized everywhere, 1

of the sixteenth century. At that
time, coffee was considered "the

drink of the devil." The young
man would have been brought
before a magistrate, probably
sentenced to a long sojourn in a
penal colony on the West Coast
of Africa, and excommunicated
from the Church.
F'ar-fetched as it may seem, the
prohibition against coffee — and
a century later against tobacco —
was enforced more harshly than
the current laws against
marijuana in the United States.
Compared to the Chinese, smok
ers here have it easy. Anyone
who trafficked in tobacco risked
decapitation under decree of
1638. Russian officers were de
ported to Siberia, where the

Czars submitted them to torture
and even death.
There are startling parallels
between the history of coffee and
tobacco and that of marijuana in
this country. Bans on these sub
stances usually came about be
cause large economic interests
pressured authorities to outlaw
products which appeared to
threaten their commercial well
being. In France during the
seventeenth century, for in
stance, wine merchants and
grape growers united in an effort
to limit the importation of coffee,
believing that its wide accep
tance would destroy the wine
business.

Similarly, tobacco interests in
this country lobbied tor the Fed
eral Uniform Narcotics and
Marijuana Tax Act which passed
in 1937 —after nearly 50 years of
perfectly acceptable use. Appa
rently, the delights of cannabis
represented too great a threat to
the established tobacco indus
try.
Criminalization has backfired,
however. Since 1956 when the
most severe federal penalities
were enacted, marijuana usage
has skyrocketed, especially
among young adults. A study
done in the spring of 1976 by the
National Institute on Drug
Abuse reveals that 13 million

Americans or eight per cent of
the total population are current
marijuana smokers. Specifically,
53 per cent of young adults,
18-25 years old, have smoked at
one time, and fully 25 per cent of
this age group are regular users.
Among the teenagers, 12-17,
nearly a quarter, both male and
female, have experimented with
"pot" at one time or another. It's
estimated 48 per cent of today's
college students have ex
perimented with grass, and 24
per cent are current users.
According to a Daily survey
taken in November, approxi
mately 55 per cent of the stu
dents here use marijuana —
seven percent higher than the
national average. Most of those
polled indicated that their usage
had increased since coming to
school (with 27 per cent stating
that their intake had more than
doubled).
Only 10 per cent of those pol
led indicated that their usage
had dropped.
Professor Irving Goffman,
chairman of the Department of
Economics at the University of
Florida, who is considered an
expert in the economics of
marijuana, estimated the total re
tail sales in the country in 1974
at about $3.5 billion. "Five vears
from now, when 1 think it will be
decriminalized everywhere, 1
think it will be $5 billion —
maybe $10 billion if you don't
account for inflation," he said.
Already eight states, begin
ning with Oregon in 1973, have
enacted modified forms of de
criminalization. Alaska has
legalized use by individuals in
their homes. Citing the influence
of enlightened public opinion,
Keith Stroup, the executive di

rector of the National Organiza
tion for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML), is optimistic
about the future of the reform
drive. "After all, for the first time
in our history, we have a presi
dent (Carter) who favors de
criminalization," he said.
Other signs of the changing
times are the creation and
growth of legitimate businesses
which serve the marijuana
smoker. They produce such
paraphernalia as pipes, incense,
hookahs, rolling paper,
machines that roll "joints" and
remove the seeds from the weed,
small spring scales, test kits,
frisk-proof money belts for hid
ing one's "stash," and plastic
storage bags with an appropriate
marijuana leaf design. The
paraphernalia trade has become
big business, currently esti
mated to be worth over $200
million a year in retail trade.
One segment of the economy
which has felt the impact is the
cigarette paper industry. For
years, it had ambled along serving
the needs of the classic Bull
Durham smoker and the occa
sional maverick who liked to roll
his own. Then the discovery of
grass by the 1960s anti-war gen
eration revived the languishing
industry, gave it a rapidly ex
panding market — and unex
pected competition from a new
breed of capitalists who saw the
profit in pot papers.
In 1972, "E-Z Wider" re
volutionzed the staid, old indus
try by inventing a high-quality,
slower-burning paper in a wider

size. It was the first company to
produce rolling paper expressly
for the "new smoker" and in
1976, Americans purchased over
30 million packs of E-Z Wider,
nearly one billion "joints."
With new companies entering
the field all the time, the
paraphernalia business is be
coming more competitive. This
summer, it was rumored that the
giants of the tobacco industry
were shooting for a piece of the
action. Columnist Jack Ander
son reported that corporate rep
resentatives were quietly lobby
ing for the legalization of
marijuana, while, back at com
pany headquarters, executives
were secretly setting aside
"choice Southern land for future
marijuana harvests," registering
trademarks on brand names
"lifted straight from marijuana
street lingo," and "making pro
duction plans " The companies
of course, deny these reports.
But advanced planning and
professional management are
not just the province of these
old-line companies. Advanced
marketing principles, MBA'd
managers, and computerized
systems, are precisely the reason
that the young firms, such as E-Z
Wider, have been able to com
pete against entrenched estab
lished corporations.
The way things are going
don't be surprised if you find
yourself signing up to be inter
viewed by one of these "new
smoker" companies through the
college placement office one day
soon.
Picture a young man standing
in the doorway of an apartment.
In his pocket, he carries a small
burlap sack just large enough to
fit in the palm of his hand.
As he is about to ring the bell,
two dark figures appear. One
seizes the burlap bag. It contains
four ounces of a fine blend of
Turkish coffee beans. The other,
producing identification says,
"You're under arrest for posses
sion of a controlled substance."
The scene actually could have
taken place in Rome during the
papacy of Clement VIII at the end
