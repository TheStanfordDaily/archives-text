# Organizers for movie festival find surprises in hooker trends

San Francisco (AP) â€” Even
organizers of the International
Hookers Film Festival were sur
prised at the number of movies
they discovered featuring the
world's oldest profession.
They found films from Hol
lywood, France, Italy, Japan and
Germany. They found at least
one silent movie and one film
that had to be smuggled out of
Hitler's Germany in fragments.
But they didn't find many
films that they felt presented an
honest and sympathetic portrait
of "working girls."
"There are probably 1,000
films that portray prostitutes as
central characters," said Lottie
Da, a member of Goyote (Call Off
Your Old Tired Ethies), which
advocates decriminalization of
prostitution.
"We wanted to be able to pre
sent some kind of range of how
prostitutes are portrayed in dif
ferent countries and at different
times," she added. "We Wanted
to show that the prostitute is not
any one stereotype."
The festival opened Monday
with a selection of Japanese and
Italian films, including Lina
Wertmuller's Love and Anarchy.

Other films among the 20
feature-length offerings are from
Germany and France, with Hol
lywood represented by movies
such as Irma Li Douce, Walk on
the Wild Side and Sweet Charity.
The final evening includes 16
short documentaries on prostitu
tion and feminist topics. All
films will be introduced by
Margo St. James, a former prosti
tute and founder of Coyote.
"We want people to under
stand the source of their at
titudes about prostitution," said
Da. "We go to movies when
we're young and we don't realize
what formula we're being fed.
"Sexually motivated women
were usually shown as French or
German. That was Hollywood's
way of dealing with it. It was
hard to show the all-American
girl coming across."
One of the featured films is a
seldom-shown Bette Davis-
Humphrey Bogard classic,
Marked Woman. Da praised the
film for showing women in a
courageous role, but said that it
minces by using the term
"nightclub hostess" instead of
prostitute.

Klondike Annie and Susan
Lenox: Her Fall and flise, two
other selections, present strong
women characters, Da said, but
they hedge on sexual realism.
She said Mae West at the end of
Klondike Annie is forced to say
she's sorry for her life of sin and
Miss Garbo at the end of Susan
Lenox begs Clark Gable for for
giveness.
"It's all by implication. They
never say prostitute. You have to
add up the clues," said Priscilla
Alexander, a festival planner.
Alexander and Da attributed
some of the problems with film
portrayal of prostitution in the
1930s andl94os to strict industry
prohibition about sex in movies.
They praised more recent
films like Klute and Sweet Char
ity for their treatments of pros
titution, but said even these
movies still showed stereotypes
of "hookers with a heart of gold"
or prostitution as a mental dis
ease.
Only two of the festival films
are by women directors,
Wertmuller's Love and Anarchy
and Nelly Kaplan's A Very Curi
ous Girl.
