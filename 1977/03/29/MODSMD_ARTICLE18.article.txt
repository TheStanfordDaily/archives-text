"Some like Octave very much
and some hate him."
Daniel Goldenberg, french
film director, is talking about a
character in his latest film, Le
Portrait de Marianne, to be
shown this Thursday as part of
the French film series. Golden
berg and his wife, a film editor,
will be present at the showing
and at a reception following, to
talk with students and answer
questions.
Le Portrait de Marianne, says
Goldenberg, is a light comedy
about a young man, Octave, who
"wakes up one morning finding
strong clues suggesting his wife
has left him." After reviewing
his alternative courses of action
— jumping out the window is
impossible because he's on the
first floor — his father isn't
around and his mother isn't in
terested in his love problems —
he finally goes to his best friend,
Alfredo, for consolation.
The film takes place during
one day i n Paris. The friends, try
ing to find out why Marianne left
Octave, reconstruct a picture of
her. Slowly, however, they
forget about Marianne and talk
about themselves. Their day
then becomes, instead of a tragic
one of loss, simply a normal day
with each other in Paris.
"The film tries to recreate a
certain atmosphere found in
classic plays," explains Golden
berg. "It is an atmosphere that
makes you dream. The external
behavior of the characters can
make you dream about what's
inside. I only show what's appa
rent about the characters, not
their internal emotions — that's
the guess."
Goldenberg's film is without
plot, he explains, because he
"doesn't like beginning, middle

and ends." Le Portrait asks more
of viewers, Goldenberg says, be
cause "they have to make their
own film" and aren't spoon-fed
everything by the director.
Goldenberg describes his
characters as "childish and sen
timental. It's a very rare race dis
appearing that talks about love
and happiness," he says. "No
one makes films about sentimen
tality much any more."
An unconventional technique
of Goldenberg's is his heavy use
of words and dialogue rather
than images. "The film is pur
posely done like a long conver
sation between Alfredo and Oc
tave," says Goldenberg. He
chooses to use a lot of dialogue to
achieve greater realism.
"In real life people talk, it's
only in film they don't talk."

"Making a film is nothing
more than being a voyeur,"
comments Goldenberg. He com
pares a director to someone sit
ting at a cafe watching people
pass by. The difference is the di
rector can transform his charac
ters into whatever he wants.
According to Goldenberg, film
audiences arealso voyeurs.They
sit uninvited in a darkroom with
three walls and watch characters
moving on a screen before them.
Goldenberg, who has also di
rected a serial, for French televi
sion, L'ane Culotte, says he pref
ers film. "Television is such an
instrument of stupidity," he
says. On American television for
instance, "how can you believe
Napoleon is in love with some
beautiful woman between
toothpaste and car commercials?

Goldenberg, who started his
career as an actor, has also as
sisted several film directors,
made some other short films of
his own and currently works for
radio.
Le Portrait de Marianne was
first shown in 1971 at the Inter
national Festival of focarno. It
has been received well, says
Goldenberg, although some cri
tics "were against it because it
moved them out of their habits.
Not really a plot-film, it seems to
go in many directions," he exp
lains.
This film, all shot on location
in Paris over a period of six
weeks, was made on a very small
budget. Goldenberg is currently
writing a sequel film script to Le
Portrait which he hopes to shoot
next year.

"Some like Octave very much
and some hate him."
Daniel Goldenberg, french
film director, is talking about a
character in his latest film, Le
Portrait de Marianne, to be
shown this Thursday as part of
the French film series. Golden
berg and his wife, a film editor,
will be present at the showing
and at a reception following, to
talk with students and answer
questions.
Le Portrait de Marianne, says
Goldenberg, is a light comedy
about a young man, Octave, who
"wakes up one morning finding
strong clues suggesting his wife
has left him." After reviewing
his alternative courses of action
— jumping out the window is
impossible because he's on the
first floor — his father isn't
around and his mother isn't in
terested in his love problems —
he finally goes to his best friend,
Alfredo, for consolation.
The film takes place during
one day i n Paris. The friends, try
ing to find out why Marianne left
Octave, reconstruct a picture of
her. Slowly, however, they
forget about Marianne and talk
about themselves. Their day
then becomes, instead of a tragic
one of loss, simply a normal day
with each other in Paris.
"The film tries to recreate a
certain atmosphere found in
classic plays," explains Golden
berg. "It is an atmosphere that
makes you dream. The external
behavior of the characters can
make you dream about what's
inside. I only show what's appa
rent about the characters, not
their internal emotions — that's
the guess."
Goldenberg's film is without
plot, he explains, because he
"doesn't like beginning, middle

and ends." Le Portrait asks more
of viewers, Goldenberg says, be
cause "they have to make their
own film" and aren't spoon-fed
everything by the director.
Goldenberg describes his
characters as "childish and sen
timental. It's a very rare race dis
appearing that talks about love
and happiness," he says. "No
one makes films about sentimen
tality much any more."
An unconventional technique
of Goldenberg's is his heavy use
of words and dialogue rather
than images. "The film is pur
posely done like a long conver
sation between Alfredo and Oc
tave," says Goldenberg. He
chooses to use a lot of dialogue to
achieve greater realism.
"In real life people talk, it's
only in film they don't talk."

"Making a film is nothing
more than being a voyeur,"
comments Goldenberg. He com
pares a director to someone sit
ting at a cafe watching people
pass by. The difference is the di
rector can transform his charac
ters into whatever he wants.
According to Goldenberg, film
audiences arealso voyeurs.They
sit uninvited in a darkroom with
three walls and watch characters
moving on a screen before them.
Goldenberg, who has also di
rected a serial, for French televi
sion, L'ane Culotte, says he pref
ers film. "Television is such an
instrument of stupidity," he
says. On American television for
instance, "how can you believe
Napoleon is in love with some
beautiful woman between
toothpaste and car commercials?

Goldenberg, who started his
career as an actor, has also as
sisted several film directors,
made some other short films of
his own and currently works for
radio.
Le Portrait de Marianne was
first shown in 1971 at the Inter
national Festival of focarno. It
has been received well, says
Goldenberg, although some cri
tics "were against it because it
moved them out of their habits.
Not really a plot-film, it seems to
go in many directions," he exp
lains.
This film, all shot on location
in Paris over a period of six
weeks, was made on a very small
budget. Goldenberg is currently
writing a sequel film script to Le
Portrait which he hopes to shoot
next year.
