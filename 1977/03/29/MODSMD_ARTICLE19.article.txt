## Benson in S.F.: magic 
### 
Things have not yet evolved to
such a state that the worlds of
jazz and classical music often in
tersect. But when they do, there
is likely to be a special feeling in
the air.
Such an intersection took
place a week ago when "short
hair" jazz guitarist George Ben
son met the California Youth
Symphony (Aaron Sten, conduc
tor) at the War Memorial Opera
House in San P'rancisco. The re
sult is jazz history.
And it is not surprising that it
was Benson making jazz history;
he has been doing more than that
lately.
His 1976 long-playing release
"Breezin' " has sold two million
copies (and counting) to become
the most popular jazz album of
all time. Furthermore, his latest
release, "In Flight" has already
passed the gold mark (half a
million).
At the outset of the concert the
different worlds of jazz and clas
sical music seemed a bit uneasy
with each other. The audience's
self-consciously worn dresses
and suits were clearly a conces
sion to the Opera House ushers'
tuxedos. And the unorthodox
applause between the
movements of the symphony's
opening selection, Mozart's
"Serenade for Strings," was a
betrayal of naive yet complete
acceptance of the symphony and
its music.
But when Benson started to
play, with the symphony behind
him, there could be no doubt that
the atmosphere lightened up;
jazz was in control and the bur
den of measuring up would rest
on the symphony. Two ques
tions would decide the issue:
Could the symphony keep up?
Would the string arrangements
bleach Benson out to high
quality muzak?
From the beginning, it was
obvious that a 50-member string
symphony is an unwieldy
aggregate, especially in com
parison to a "loose" five-man
combo. Taking his cues from
pianist Jorge Dal to and keyboar
dist Ronnie Foster, conductor
Sten worked very hard at keep
ing pace with the jazzmen.
Most of the time he was suc
cessful and only occasionally
did Benson, Foster and Dalto
"cook on out" in front of the

driving rhythm of drummer
Dennis Davis and bassist Stanley
Banks, leaving Sten forlornly
marking time, a hair behind the
beat.
Claus Ogerman's string ar
rangements were handled with
similar success: for the most part
the symphony stayed discretely
in the background, coming to the
forefront mostly at the start and
sometimes at the finish of a
piece.
So well did things go that, by
intermission, everyone includ
ing even the ushers, was relaxed
and happy â€” a fact which is at
tested by the warm reception Bill
Graham received when, prior to
the start of the second half, he
presented Benson with a certifi
cate of welcome from the mayor
himself.

The first half had consisted of
some more and less well-known
Benson standards ("Affirma
tion," "The Wind and I," "Ev
erything Must Change," "Lady,"
"Elmar" and "Gonna Love You
More") while the first part of
second half had the jazzmen
playing a rousing set, unas
sisted, starting with "Take
Five." In a final collaboration on
"Nature Boy," "So this love"
and "Masquerade," with
"Breezin* " as an encore, the
musicians could not help but
please.
Tallying up the score for the
evening, the musicians are to be
praised and congratulated. Bill
Graham is to be thanked, and the
audience is to be envied. The
concert was a thoroughgoing
success.
