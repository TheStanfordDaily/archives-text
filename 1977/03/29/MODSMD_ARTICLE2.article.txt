# Stevens head calls campus 'uninformed'
## 
### Martin Kernberg 
Students and administrators here
faded to come to an "informed judg
ment" about the labor conflict at the
J.P. Stevens Company, charged James
Finley, chairman of the board of Ste
vens, in a letter to Robert Augsburger,
vice president forbusinessand finance
here.
Finley's letter, dated March 1. is a
response to a Feb. 24 communication
from Augsburger which noted that
1 800 students, 70 faculty members and
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility had urged the University

to vote its 3000 shares of J.P. Stevens
stock in favor of two proxy resolutions
on labor policy.
The resolutions called for the dis
closure of affirmative action and equal
opportunity figures (Proposal 5) and
detailed labor policy and practices in
formation.
Finley charged in the letter that the
1600 Stanford students who signed the
petition critical of Stevens labor
policies "did not take the time or make
the effort to come to an informed
judgment concerning the campaign
which the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) is
waging against Stevens."
Finley also wrote, "it is my belief
that there exists on any campus a
group willing to espouse virtually any
'cause' that is presented to them, and
that such a group rarely represents the
mainstream thinking of the student
body as a whole."
The letter has not been publicly re
leased by the University, but the Daily
obtained a copy. In it, Finley claims
that Augsburger was uninformed on
Stevens' policies and practices con
cerning safety, health, the right to
work, collective bargaining and Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
litigation.
Finley wrote that "to my knowledge,
you have talked to no one in my Com
pany or asked for any information on
these matters ... I do not believe that it
was possible for you to make an objec
tive judgment on Proposal 5."
Moreover, Finley wrote that "a uni
versity should teach by example, and
one of the first things that should be
taught is to hear all sides of an issue."
With the letter, two documents, also
unreleased bv the University, were in

eluded for Augsburger and the Com
mission on Investment Responsibility
which detail Stevens' labor practices.
Augsburger said yesterday release of
the letter would raise its contents "into
the political realm" and "stand in the
way of accomplishing anything."
Augsburger stressed that the peti
tion circulated by the Committee for
Justice at J.F\ Stevens had not influ
enced his final decision on the proxy
vote. "We don't work that way," he
said, disagreeing with an allegation of
Finley's. He said "stockholder in
terest" was carefully evaluated and
used as the primary criterion for the
University's votes.
However, Augsburger said until
Feb. 18, 10 days before the stockhol
ders' vote in New York, "1 wasn't
aware we owned any J.P. Stevens stock
or that there was any controversy at the
company."
Augsburger explained why the Uni
versity abstained on the second stoc
kholders' resolution, saying, "We are
not prepared to ask a company to do
things we are not prepared to do ourse
lves." Revealing basic data on wage
rates for the different employe groups
at the University, "would be mislead
ing and would get people upset," said
Augsburger.
Since March 1, Stevens has sent ad
ditional information to Augsburger on
the firm's operations and labor rela
tions. A brochure entitled "Straighten
ing Things Out," describes, according
to Finley, "contributions to the com
munity, education, environmental
protection and energy conservation"
made by the company and gives Ste
vens' positions on the ACTWU, labor
law. employe relations, wages, be
nefits, minorities, occupational health

and occupational safety.
The brochure, published by Stevens
on Feb. 15 states that
—union membership is declining at
the company,
—the union has been found guilty of
unfair labor practices more often than
the firm,
—the union has been rejected by
employes in 11 of 12 elections,

—wages have increased an average
of seven per cent per year in the last 10
yea rs,
—23 per cent of Stevens' work force
are comprised of minorities,
—the textile industry along with
Stevens is one of the safest places to
work in all industry,
—Stevens' contributions to educa
tion (as a per cent of pretax income) are
triple the national corporate average.
