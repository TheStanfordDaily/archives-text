## 'The Late Show' 
### 
Wam*r Bros, rataaaa, produced by Robert
Attman. Written and dractad by Robert Ban
ton. Stars Lly Tort*) and Art Camay.
The Late Show is a variation
on the traditional detective thril
ler and alternates between being
a very clever parody of the genre
and merely a poor imitation of it.
The story goes as follows:
Harry (Howard Duff), a private
detective, is hired by Margo to
find her cat. Maxgo came to Los
Angeles to be an actress, but she
makes her living on the fringes,
designing clothes, dealing a lit
tle grass, and transporting stolen
goods.
Margo is played by Lily Tom
lin, for whom the part is restrict
ing; but Tomlin manages to
make Margo somewhat more
than the fruity bohemian, which
seems to be the way Benton saw
the part. 1 n one of her shady bus
iness deals she keeps $500
which does not belong to her,
and the hoods for whom she is
working take her cat, threaten
ing to strangle it unless she pays
up.
In trying to find the cat, Harry
gets shot and turns up at Ira
Wells' rooming house with a
bullet hole in his stomach. Ira
Wells, played by Art Carney, is
an over-the-hill private detec

tive, the exact opposite of a de
xterous, fast-talking Bogart.
Confusion
We go through the story at
Ira's pace, never getting any
hints before he does, and we are
often in a state of confusion as to
what is actually taking place.
Ira's attempt to revenge Harry's
death involves scenes of in
explicable shootings and meet
ings with opportunists and
gangsters.
Eugene Roche plays Ron
Birdwell, whose serious physi
cal and verbal threats to Ira are
interspersed with a comic,
salesmanlike patter. David Con
sidine plays Birdwell's body
guard, a thug who, when forced
at gunpoint by Ira to jump into a
pool, becomes nearly hysterical
at the thought of ruining his
cashmere jacket.
The confusion in the plot is
important in subverting the
common formula of the detec
tive thriller. Any logic in the
story is irrelevant.
The real basis of The Late
Show are the characters of Margo
and Ira. And yet there is a dis
turbing disparity between the
way Benton wrote the script and
the way he directed the film.

The script gives Margo no
more than a modicum of intelli
gence. The comments she makes
in any given situation were
perhaps written as comedy, but
they come off as annoying and
inappropriate for the scenes. Yet
Tomlin manages to overcome
this handicap and makes her
Margo more appealing than the
words that come out of her
mouth or the things she does
would allow.
Dignity
The same holds true for the
character of Ira Wells. Carney de
livers a very powerful perfor
mance in this role. Given the
script, it would be dangerously
easy to laugh him off as a floun
dering fool — but Carney brings
to the part a dignity and pathos
which make you take Ira quite
seriously.
The editing style is reminis
cent of the detective thriller
genre, but it is always kept in
check by the comic touches in
plot and detail. You're in a state
of suspense, but always on the
verge of laughter.
The Late Show never lives up
to the expectations that it raises.
It doesn't have the courage to
thoroughly parody the genre,
nor does it allow the actors to
fully develop their characters. It
leaves you with the feeling that
the laughs have been cheap.

easy to laugh him off as a floun
dering fool — but Carney brings
to the part a dignity and pathos
which make you take Ira quite
seriously.
The editing style is reminis
cent of the detective thriller
genre, but it is always kept in
check by the comic touches in
plot and detail. You're in a state
of suspense, but always on the
verge of laughter.
The Late Show never lives up
to the expectations that it raises.
It doesn't have the courage to
thoroughly parody the genre,
nor does it allow the actors to
fully develop their characters. It
leaves you with the feeling that
the laughs have been cheap.
Wam*r Bros, rataaaa, produced by Robert
Attman. Written and dractad by Robert Ban
ton. Stars Lly Tort*) and Art Camay.
The Late Show is a variation
on the traditional detective thril
ler and alternates between being
a very clever parody of the genre
and merely a poor imitation of it.
The story goes as follows:
Harry (Howard Duff), a private
detective, is hired by Margo to
find her cat. Maxgo came to Los
Angeles to be an actress, but she
makes her living on the fringes,
designing clothes, dealing a lit
tle grass, and transporting stolen
goods.
Margo is played by Lily Tom
lin, for whom the part is restrict
ing; but Tomlin manages to
make Margo somewhat more
than the fruity bohemian, which
seems to be the way Benton saw
the part. 1 n one of her shady bus
iness deals she keeps $500
which does not belong to her,
and the hoods for whom she is
working take her cat, threaten
ing to strangle it unless she pays
up.
In trying to find the cat, Harry
gets shot and turns up at Ira
Wells' rooming house with a
bullet hole in his stomach. Ira
Wells, played by Art Carney, is
an over-the-hill private detec

tive, the exact opposite of a de
xterous, fast-talking Bogart.
Confusion
We go through the story at
Ira's pace, never getting any
hints before he does, and we are
often in a state of confusion as to
what is actually taking place.
Ira's attempt to revenge Harry's
death involves scenes of in
explicable shootings and meet
ings with opportunists and
gangsters.
Eugene Roche plays Ron
Birdwell, whose serious physi
cal and verbal threats to Ira are
interspersed with a comic,
salesmanlike patter. David Con
sidine plays Birdwell's body
guard, a thug who, when forced
at gunpoint by Ira to jump into a
pool, becomes nearly hysterical
at the thought of ruining his
cashmere jacket.
The confusion in the plot is
important in subverting the
common formula of the detec
tive thriller. Any logic in the
story is irrelevant.
The real basis of The Late
Show are the characters of Margo
and Ira. And yet there is a dis
turbing disparity between the
way Benton wrote the script and
the way he directed the film.

The script gives Margo no
more than a modicum of intelli
gence. The comments she makes
in any given situation were
perhaps written as comedy, but
they come off as annoying and
inappropriate for the scenes. Yet
Tomlin manages to overcome
this handicap and makes her
Margo more appealing than the
words that come out of her
mouth or the things she does
would allow.
Dignity
The same holds true for the
character of Ira Wells. Carney de
livers a very powerful perfor
mance in this role. Given the
script, it would be dangerously
easy to laugh him off as a floun
dering fool — but Carney brings
to the part a dignity and pathos
which make you take Ira quite
seriously.
