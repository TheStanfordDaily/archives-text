For an intimate farewell din
ner for a close friend of mine
who had graduated winter quar
ter, I decided on St. Michael's
because of the warm and cozy
atmosphere created by the
50-odd warm bodies firmly but
comfortably nestled within the
wood-paneled walls. The
warmth inside contrasted with
the cool winter air outside,
where my companion and I sat
talking while we waited about
10 minutes for our table.
Once inside, the stained-glass
windows and imported chan
dalier's yellowish glow helped
provide a sense of privacy for us
among the chatter of contented
diners.
Selecting our dinner necessi
tated peeking around the wine
bar to check out the menu, writ
ten on a chalkboard. According
to co-owner Roger Jones, the
menu is on the chalkboard be
cause except for several regular
dishes, such as Greek Chicken
and Veal Scallopini, the items on
the menu change from day to
day. After discussing the merits
of some of the special dinners,
including seafood specialties,
lamb steak and fillet of sole with

the waitress, I settled on the
fresh, broiled trout and my com
panion selected the Greek Chic
ken, coated with a special greek
wine sauce. For the wine, the
waitress described the varied
wine list as we flipped through
it. We decided on a moderately
priced ($5.50/ bottle) California
White, which the waitress told
us would be dry. The wine
turned out to be dry with a fruity
aftertaste, however. The wine
went well with both main
courses, which were preceded
by appetizers, soup and salad
which vary daily. We did not,
however, receive any bread.
My companion was delighted
with the chicken dish, particul
ary the unique flavor added by
the Greek wine sauce. I, how
ever, found the fresh trout to be
nothing extraordinary. We both
were extremely satisfied with
the broccoli with cheese sauce
which accompanied both din
ners. Our only complaint was
that there was not enough of it.
The dinner also included a
choice of french fries or brown
rice.
Although the meal appeared
small, we found that the help
ings were filling and there was
enough to keep us busy as we
leisurely chatted for nearly two
hours.

ary the unique flavor added by
the Greek wine sauce. I, how
ever, found the fresh trout to be
nothing extraordinary. We both
were extremely satisfied with
the broccoli with cheese sauce
which accompanied both din
ners. Our only complaint was
that there was not enough of it.
The dinner also included a
choice of french fries or brown
rice.
Although the meal appeared
small, we found that the help
ings were filling and there was
enough to keep us busy as we
leisurely chatted for nearly two
hours.

For an intimate farewell din
ner for a close friend of mine
who had graduated winter quar
ter, I decided on St. Michael's
because of the warm and cozy
atmosphere created by the
50-odd warm bodies firmly but
comfortably nestled within the
wood-paneled walls. The
warmth inside contrasted with
the cool winter air outside,
where my companion and I sat
talking while we waited about
10 minutes for our table.
Once inside, the stained-glass
windows and imported chan
dalier's yellowish glow helped
provide a sense of privacy for us
among the chatter of contented
diners.
Selecting our dinner necessi
tated peeking around the wine
bar to check out the menu, writ
ten on a chalkboard. According
to co-owner Roger Jones, the
menu is on the chalkboard be
cause except for several regular
dishes, such as Greek Chicken
and Veal Scallopini, the items on
the menu change from day to
day. After discussing the merits
of some of the special dinners,
including seafood specialties,
lamb steak and fillet of sole with

the waitress, I settled on the
fresh, broiled trout and my com
panion selected the Greek Chic
ken, coated with a special greek
wine sauce. For the wine, the
waitress described the varied
wine list as we flipped through
it. We decided on a moderately
priced ($5.50/ bottle) California
White, which the waitress told
us would be dry. The wine
turned out to be dry with a fruity
aftertaste, however. The wine
went well with both main
courses, which were preceded
by appetizers, soup and salad
which vary daily. We did not,
however, receive any bread.
My companion was delighted
with the chicken dish, particul
ary the unique flavor added by
the Greek wine sauce. I, how
ever, found the fresh trout to be
nothing extraordinary. We both
were extremely satisfied with
the broccoli with cheese sauce
which accompanied both din
ners. Our only complaint was
that there was not enough of it.
