To break the finals week ten
sion, a friend and I took an even
ing out from our gruelling
studies to enjoy a relaxed dinner
i in the formal, but cozy dining
room at the Tokaj Restaurant.
We selected a traditional Hun
garian dish called the Wooden
j Flatter, because it is served on a
wooden platter, also known as
! Fantaneros, a specialty for
i which the restaurant is known.
The dish consisted of a base
| made up of pickled vegetables,
' red cabbage and saurkraut top-
I ped by a layer of fried potatoes
; and rice. On top of this are tender
pork and veal cutlets and lamb
1 and beef steaks.
The hostess was courteous
and knowledgeable about the
dishes and her recommenda
| tions for a wine to compliment
the meal were very good.
The owners, Bela and Inga
Kardos, are from Germany, and
have been operating Tokaj for 14
years.
The Tokaj offers a selection of
German, Austrian and Hunga
rian dishes which include a soup
or salad appetizer and dessert.
With a fine wine, a filling and
flavorful meal can be had for $16
to $25.
