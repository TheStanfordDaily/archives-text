The Tymes (RCA)
The Tymes, best known for
their single, "You Little
Trustmaker," is a Philadelphia
based group from the 50s. They
occupy a niche in rock music
trivia history, for their first re
lease, "So Much In Love," was
the first to replace the Beatles at
the number one position on the
English charts. Other Top Ten

hits include "Wonderful, won
derful," "Somewhere,"
"People," and "Ms. Grace."
The group consists of three
members of the original quartet,
plus two female artists appear
ing for the first time on this al
bum. Turning Point displays
variety and talent, allowing the
group to remain contemporary.
The overall sound has a fresh
quality similar to that of the Fifth
Dimension, best exemplified by
"Traces of You." However, their
easy listening arrangement is
hampered by repetitious,
cliched lyrics on several cuts.
While more lyrical originality is
needed, Turning Point is a good
example of the increasingly
popular "Philadelphia Sound."
