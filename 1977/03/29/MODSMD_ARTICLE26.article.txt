When George Benson, one of
the top contemporary jazz musi
cians, recommends a guitarist to
Capitol Records, you can be sure
that he has talent. Such is the
case with Bill Nelson, lead guitar
for Be Bop Deluxe, one of Eng
land's most promising new rock
groups.
Their musical style rivals the
most sequined, tight-clothed
bands around, yet on stage they
look more like the Everly
Brothers than Elton John.
Double-breasted suits are
often their concert attire. This
ironic twist has earned them a
reputation within the recording
industry for individuality.
The best example of this group
on Modern Music comes on side
two, which opens with a simu
lated flip through radio chan
nels, a reprise arrange of six
songs reminiscent of, but not as
masterful as the Beatles (i.e.
their "Abbey Road" album).
Ironically, Modern Music was
recorded at EMl's Abbey Road
studio.
Bill Nelson's explicit lyric im
agery and guitar skill stand out,
but his dominance over the rest
of the group stifles the collective
creativity hinted at in Modern
Music. Their sense of rhythmic
and instrumental arrangements,
along with their versatility of
musical styles promise a bright
future for Be Bop Deluxe.
