Investigators probe airline crash
Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Canary Islands
Spanish authorities yesterday ruled out sabotage or
control tower error in the collision of American and
Dutch jumbo jets that killed 575 persons in the
greatest tragedy of aviation history.
There were conflicting reports on how the Boeing
747s of Pan American World Airways and the Dutch
KLM airline collided on the runway of this Spanish
island Sunday afternoon. American, Spanish and
Dutch investigators were probing the blackened
ruins of the jetliners.
Both planes were diverted to the Santa Cruz air
port because of a terrorist bomb explosion earlier at
the air terminal at Las Palmas, on a neighboring
island that had been their original destination.
KLM officials reported all 248 passengers and
crew members on its jet perished in the flames and
explosions.
A Pan American spokesman said there were 70
survivors, including the pilot, from its plane but 326
were killed — 3 17 passengers and nine crew mem
bers.

U.S. compiles record trade deficit
Washington — The imported oil that fired the
nation's furnaces this winter helped push the U.S.
trade balance into a record deficit for the third time
in four months, the government said today.
An administration economist said the severe de
ficits of recent months are expected to improve along
with the weather. But in just two months the nation
has run up a deficit more than half the size of the
$5.87 billion deficit for all of last year.
Imports exceeded exports by $1.866 billion in Feb
ruary, the Commerce Department said, surpassing
January's record $1.67 billion difference. January, in
turn, had surpassed November's $1.03 billion de
ficit, which also had set a record.
Scope of death penalty reviewed
Washington — The Supreme Court listened to
four hours of arguments yesterday on the future of
four condemned criminals and the scope of capital
punishment in the United States.
The court, electing to hear arguments in four sepa
rate death penalty cases, will weigh those arguments
in deciding:
—Whether the death penalty is a valid punish
ment for rape.
—Whether a state can automatically sentence to
death the murderer of a police officer.
—Whether a person who commits a crime punish
able by death under a state law later struck down as
unconstitutional can be condemned someyears later
under a new, constitutional state law.
—How far a prosecutor may go in making impas
sioned arguments to a jury in a trial that could end in
a death sentence for the defendant.
The Supreme Court last July 2 upheld death pen
alty laws in Ceorgia, Florida and Texas but ruled
only on how those laws are imposed for murderers.
The court did not decide whether the death penalty
is valid for other crimes.
High court to decide on tapes
Washington — Former President Richard Nixon's
attorneys won another day in court when the Sup
reme Court agreed yesterday to decide whether the
30 White House tapes played in the Watergate trial of
Nixon's top advisers should be released to the pub
lic.
The high court agreed to review a ruling by the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington that the
tapes are no longer confidential.
Pentagon to upgrade discharges
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold Brown
yesterday authorized the armed services to upgrade
more than 432,000 undesirable and general dis
charges given for Vietnam War desertion, drug abuse

and other causes.
Each case will be considered on its own merits,
unlike President Jimmy Carter's blanket pardon of
thousands of draft evaders.
Each eligible person will have to apply for a
change.
Carter has approved the Pentagon's plans which
would mark the second stage of his effort to heal the
divisiveness growing out of the Vietnam War.
The Pentagon's program will cover 173,006 men
who received undesirable discharges, including
69,170 deserters who failed to take part in President
Cerald Ford's clemency program. These deserters
were given undesirable discharges in place of a pos
sible courts martial.
In addition, the Pentagon plan authorizes the
armed services to upgrade 259,524 general dis
charges.
Unlike undesirable discharges, general discharges
are considered as being under honorable conditions.
There is no loss of veterans' or other benefits.

747s of Pan American World Airways and the Dutch
KLM airline collided on the runway of this Spanish
island Sunday afternoon. American, Spanish and
Dutch investigators were probing the blackened
ruins of the jetliners.
Both planes were diverted to the Santa Cruz air
port because of a terrorist bomb explosion earlier at
the air terminal at Las Palmas, on a neighboring
island that had been their original destination.
KLM officials reported all 248 passengers and
crew members on its jet perished in the flames and
explosions.
A Pan American spokesman said there were 70
survivors, including the pilot, from its plane but 326
were killed — 3 17 passengers and nine crew mem

U.S. compiles record trade deficit
Washington — The imported oil that fired the
nation's furnaces this winter helped push the U.S.
trade balance into a record deficit for the third time
in four months, the government said today.
An administration economist said the severe de
ficits of recent months are expected to improve along
with the weather. But in just two months the nation
has run up a deficit more than half the size of the
$5.87 billion deficit for all of last year.
Imports exceeded exports by $1.866 billion in Feb
ruary, the Commerce Department said, surpassing
January's record $1.67 billion difference. January, in
turn, had surpassed November's $1.03 billion de
ficit, which also had set a record.
Scope of death penalty reviewed
Washington — The Supreme Court listened to
four hours of arguments yesterday on the future of
four condemned criminals and the scope of capital
punishment in the United States.
The court, electing to hear arguments in four sepa
rate death penalty cases, will weigh those arguments
in deciding:
—Whether the death penalty is a valid punish
ment for rape.
—Whether a state can automatically sentence to
death the murderer of a police officer.
—Whether a person who commits a crime punish
able by death under a state law later struck down as
unconstitutional can be condemned someyears later
under a new, constitutional state law.
—How far a prosecutor may go in making impas
sioned arguments to a jury in a trial that could end in
a death sentence for the defendant.
The Supreme Court last July 2 upheld death pen
alty laws in Ceorgia, Florida and Texas but ruled
only on how those laws are imposed for murderers.
The court did not decide whether the death penalty
is valid for other crimes.
High court to decide on tapes
Washington — Former President Richard Nixon's
attorneys won another day in court when the Sup

The high court agreed to review a ruling by the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington that the
tapes are no longer confidential.
Pentagon to upgrade discharges
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold Brown
yesterday authorized the armed services to upgrade
more than 432,000 undesirable and general dis
charges given for Vietnam War desertion, drug abuse

and other causes.
Each case will be considered on its own merits,
unlike President Jimmy Carter's blanket pardon of
thousands of draft evaders.
Each eligible person will have to apply for a
change.
Carter has approved the Pentagon's plans which
would mark the second stage of his effort to heal the
divisiveness growing out of the Vietnam War.
The Pentagon's program will cover 173,006 men
who received undesirable discharges, including
69,170 deserters who failed to take part in President
Cerald Ford's clemency program. These deserters
were given undesirable discharges in place of a pos
sible courts martial.
In addition, the Pentagon plan authorizes the
armed services to upgrade 259,524 general dis
charges.
Unlike undesirable discharges, general discharges
are considered as being under honorable conditions.
There is no loss of veterans' or other benefits.

and other causes.

change.

would mark the second stage of his effort to heal the
divisiveness growing out of the Vietnam War.

Investigators probe airline crash
Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Canary Islands
Spanish authorities yesterday ruled out sabotage or
control tower error in the collision of American and
Dutch jumbo jets that killed 575 persons in the
greatest tragedy of aviation history.
There were conflicting reports on how the Boeing
747s of Pan American World Airways and the Dutch
KLM airline collided on the runway of this Spanish
island Sunday afternoon. American, Spanish and
Dutch investigators were probing the blackened
ruins of the jetliners.
Both planes were diverted to the Santa Cruz air
port because of a terrorist bomb explosion earlier at
the air terminal at Las Palmas, on a neighboring
island that had been their original destination.
KLM officials reported all 248 passengers and
crew members on its jet perished in the flames and
explosions.
A Pan American spokesman said there were 70
survivors, including the pilot, from its plane but 326
were killed — 3 17 passengers and nine crew mem

U.S. compiles record trade deficit
Washington — The imported oil that fired the
nation's furnaces this winter helped push the U.S.
trade balance into a record deficit for the third time
in four months, the government said today.
An administration economist said the severe de
ficits of recent months are expected to improve along
with the weather. But in just two months the nation
has run up a deficit more than half the size of the
$5.87 billion deficit for all of last year.
Imports exceeded exports by $1.866 billion in Feb

January's record $1.67 billion difference. January, in
turn, had surpassed November's $1.03 billion de
ficit, which also had set a record.
