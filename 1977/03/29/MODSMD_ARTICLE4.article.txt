# Rodin sculptures, the Golden Spike and more await visitors to the Stanford Museum
## 
### Caitlin Hurt 
You have a hole in your day, that
hour between classes that's too short
for heavy-duty studying and 100 long
for staring into space. That's the time
for a short amble down past the chem
building on Lomita Drive and a new
discovery: the Museum of Art.
An Egyptian mummy, Little I.e
land's velocipede and silver spoons
made by Paul Revere are only a few of
the diverse attractions.
The general exhibits include native
American and early Californian art.
Stanford family memorabilia, ancient
and primitive art. a jade collection,
2()th century art and the Rodin collec
tion.
Liz Shivell, a museum guard, said
"If students come to the museum it's
usually to write a paper. They sort of
wander in and ask, 'Is this the
museum?' "
Seminars
Some professors do hold their semi
nars at the museum and encourage
using the museum as a research tool,
but for the most part, "the vast majority

of students have no idea we're here."
"Not everybody is going to like ev
erything," says curator Betsy
Fryberger, "but there should be some
thing for everyone."
Originally conceived by Jane Stan
ford as a place to house Little Leland's
assemblage of objects and articles, the
museum was long her special project
and supported by her personal in
come.
The building itself is a copy of a
museum in Athens for which Little Le
land had a particular fondness.
The same time
Built at the same time as the Inner
Quad in 1891, the museum is architec
turally distinguished by being the first
major structure west of the Missis
sippi.
A few years later, annexes of ordi
nary concrete were added, forming a
complete quadrangle.
These were destroyed by the 1906
earthquake leaving only the original
wing intact at the intersection of
Lomita Drive and Museum Way.
Headless and armless is "The Walk

ing Man" by Rodin which greets you
in the main lobhy. Take this in stride,
and move to the left of the main entr
ance to find the famous Golden Spike.
Engraved on all sides with names
and dates, this is one of four
precious-metal spikes used in the
ceremonial linking of the Central
Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific
Railroad at Promontory, Utah.
Following the ceremony, the preci
ous spikes were replaced with mun
dane ones, and in 1892 the Golden
Spike was passed to the Stanford
Museum.
Beyond the spike is a selection of
handspun. woven wool blankets, pot
tery. and woven baskets representing
works of the Pueblo. Navajo, Apache
and the lesser known California tribes.
Sharing the same room is the early
Californian collection. Displays of
Colonial silver are featured here, from
teaspoons to tankards, some among
them made by Paul Revere.
Memorabilia
The Stanford collection is an amaz
ing assortment of memorabilia of an

amazing family. Look for a large oil
painting carefully portraying Mrs.
Stanford's jewels before she sold them
in London for the benefit of the Uni
versity.
You can't fit a quarter overseas in
your schedule? Don't be disappointed.
Eleven-year-old Leland filled his poc
kets with pieces of Europe on a trip
there with his parents.
Not to be missed are tiles from a
mosaic in Pompeii, lava from Ves
uvius, and yes, a mummified alligator.
Little Iceland's velocipede is dis
played without explanation in the
middle of the room but it's hard to
miss. A picture postcard of it, available
at the desk, will prove to doubting
friends that you really saw it.
Well supplemented
The Rodin sculptures are especially
well supplemented by photographs,
descriptions and Rodin's own
thoughts about his life, his training
and his works.

works; it is something to experience
and absorb first hand.
Crossing back through the lobby
with a friendly nod to "The Walking

the main entrance.
The European collection is a small
hut complete selection of woodcuts,
sketches and oils. Look for Fuseli's
"Adam and Eve" among the familiar
array of portraits, landscapes and Holy
Trinities.
True bliss
Buddhas from Thailand and China
abound in the Oriental rooms. Find the
"Reclining Buddha in the Attitude of
Nirvana" for a glimpse of true bliss, in
case you've forgotten what it's like.
Especially soothing for minds worn
and weary from too much studying are
the Oriental silk hanging scrolls, de
signed and painted to invite you into
the misty, lyrical landscapes.
The miniature carvings and
sculptures in the Frank E. Buck room
of jade defy all conceptions of mass
and matter.

The circular room of ancient art con
tains the mummy, a woman from 525
B.C. and Grecian urns, among other
relics. A room upstairs contains tin;
collections ot primitive art from
around the world.
Restless European artists of the early
2()th century discovered with joy the
simple strength of this art and used it
to give birth to a new artistic move
ment, Expressionism.
Spot Archer's target
Sadly, the room of 20th century art
lacks a good example of this cross
cultural influence, hut look lor Roy
Lichtenstein's "Bull" and its
metamorphosis into a geometrical de
sign.
Also, find Paul Manship's "Archer"
and sight along its arrow to what an
apparently accidental arrangement
provided as a target.
A mummy? That's something to
write home about. There's more to
Stanford than White Plaza and the
Sunday Flicks.

Changing Face in the Mirror of Art.
You have a hole in your day, that
hour between classes that's too short
for heavy-duty studying and 100 long
for staring into space. That's the time
for a short amble down past the chem
building on Lomita Drive and a new
discovery: the Museum of Art.
An Egyptian mummy, Little I.e
land's velocipede and silver spoons
made by Paul Revere are only a few of
the diverse attractions.
The general exhibits include native
American and early Californian art.
Stanford family memorabilia, ancient
and primitive art. a jade collection,
2()th century art and the Rodin collec
tion.
Liz Shivell, a museum guard, said
"If students come to the museum it's
usually to write a paper. They sort of
wander in and ask, 'Is this the
museum?' "
Seminars
Some professors do hold their semi
nars at the museum and encourage
using the museum as a research tool,
but for the most part, "the vast majority

of students have no idea we're here."
"Not everybody is going to like ev
erything," says curator Betsy
Fryberger, "but there should be some
thing for everyone."
Originally conceived by Jane Stan
ford as a place to house Little Leland's
assemblage of objects and articles, the
museum was long her special project
and supported by her personal in
come.
The building itself is a copy of a
museum in Athens for which Little Le
land had a particular fondness.
The same time
Built at the same time as the Inner
Quad in 1891, the museum is architec
turally distinguished by being the first
major structure west of the Missis
sippi.
A few years later, annexes of ordi
nary concrete were added, forming a
complete quadrangle.
These were destroyed by the 1906
earthquake leaving only the original
wing intact at the intersection of
Lomita Drive and Museum Way.
Headless and armless is "The Walk

ing Man" by Rodin which greets you
in the main lobhy. Take this in stride,
and move to the left of the main entr
ance to find the famous Golden Spike.
Engraved on all sides with names
and dates, this is one of four
precious-metal spikes used in the
ceremonial linking of the Central
Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific
Railroad at Promontory, Utah.
Following the ceremony, the preci
ous spikes were replaced with mun
dane ones, and in 1892 the Golden
Spike was passed to the Stanford
Museum.
Beyond the spike is a selection of
handspun. woven wool blankets, pot
tery. and woven baskets representing
works of the Pueblo. Navajo, Apache
and the lesser known California tribes.
Sharing the same room is the early
Californian collection. Displays of
Colonial silver are featured here, from
teaspoons to tankards, some among
them made by Paul Revere.
Memorabilia
The Stanford collection is an amaz
ing assortment of memorabilia of an

amazing family. Look for a large oil
painting carefully portraying Mrs.
Stanford's jewels before she sold them
in London for the benefit of the Uni
versity.
You can't fit a quarter overseas in
your schedule? Don't be disappointed.
Eleven-year-old Leland filled his poc
kets with pieces of Europe on a trip
there with his parents.
Not to be missed are tiles from a
mosaic in Pompeii, lava from Ves
uvius, and yes, a mummified alligator.
Little Iceland's velocipede is dis
played without explanation in the
middle of the room but it's hard to
miss. A picture postcard of it, available
at the desk, will prove to doubting
friends that you really saw it.
Well supplemented
The Rodin sculptures are especially
well supplemented by photographs,
descriptions and Rodin's own
thoughts about his life, his training
and his works.

5 to June 19 — Portraits: Mankind's
Changing Face in the Mirror of Art.
You have a hole in your day, that
hour between classes that's too short
for heavy-duty studying and 100 long
for staring into space. That's the time
for a short amble down past the chem
building on Lomita Drive and a new
discovery: the Museum of Art.
An Egyptian mummy, Little I.e
land's velocipede and silver spoons
made by Paul Revere are only a few of
the diverse attractions.
The general exhibits include native
American and early Californian art.
Stanford family memorabilia, ancient
and primitive art. a jade collection,
2()th century art and the Rodin collec
tion.
Liz Shivell, a museum guard, said
"If students come to the museum it's
usually to write a paper. They sort of
wander in and ask, 'Is this the
museum?' "
Seminars
Some professors do hold their semi
nars at the museum and encourage
using the museum as a research tool,
but for the most part, "the vast majority

of students have no idea we're here."
"Not everybody is going to like ev
erything," says curator Betsy
Fryberger, "but there should be some
thing for everyone."
Originally conceived by Jane Stan
ford as a place to house Little Leland's
assemblage of objects and articles, the
museum was long her special project
and supported by her personal in
come.
The building itself is a copy of a
museum in Athens for which Little Le
land had a particular fondness.
The same time
Built at the same time as the Inner
Quad in 1891, the museum is architec
turally distinguished by being the first
major structure west of the Missis
sippi.
A few years later, annexes of ordi
nary concrete were added, forming a
complete quadrangle.
These were destroyed by the 1906
earthquake leaving only the original
wing intact at the intersection of
Lomita Drive and Museum Way.
Headless and armless is "The Walk

ing Man" by Rodin which greets you
in the main lobhy. Take this in stride,
and move to the left of the main entr
ance to find the famous Golden Spike.
Engraved on all sides with names
and dates, this is one of four
precious-metal spikes used in the
ceremonial linking of the Central
Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific
Railroad at Promontory, Utah.
Following the ceremony, the preci
ous spikes were replaced with mun
dane ones, and in 1892 the Golden
Spike was passed to the Stanford
Museum.
Beyond the spike is a selection of
handspun. woven wool blankets, pot
tery. and woven baskets representing
works of the Pueblo. Navajo, Apache
and the lesser known California tribes.
Sharing the same room is the early
Californian collection. Displays of
Colonial silver are featured here, from
teaspoons to tankards, some among
them made by Paul Revere.
Memorabilia
The Stanford collection is an amaz
ing assortment of memorabilia of an

amazing family. Look for a large oil
painting carefully portraying Mrs.
Stanford's jewels before she sold them
in London for the benefit of the Uni
versity.
You can't fit a quarter overseas in
your schedule? Don't be disappointed.
Eleven-year-old Leland filled his poc
kets with pieces of Europe on a trip
there with his parents.
Not to be missed are tiles from a
mosaic in Pompeii, lava from Ves
uvius, and yes, a mummified alligator.
Little Iceland's velocipede is dis
played without explanation in the
middle of the room but it's hard to
miss. A picture postcard of it, available
at the desk, will prove to doubting
friends that you really saw it.
Well supplemented
The Rodin sculptures are especially
well supplemented by photographs,
descriptions and Rodin's own
thoughts about his life, his training
and his works.
A few minutes or hours spent with
Rodin's sculptures is time spent with

Museum musings

memorabilia, sculpture and jade collections, and ancient and primitive art
exhibits.
overwhelmingly sensitive and pas
sionate expressions of humanity.
Needless to say, words are not built
for re-capturing the spirit of these
works; it is something to experience
and absorb first hand.
Crossing back through the lobby
with a friendly nod to "The Walking
Man," enter the rooms to the right of
the main entrance.
The European collection is a small
hut complete selection of woodcuts,
sketches and oils. Look for Fuseli's
"Adam and Eve" among the familiar
array of portraits, landscapes and Holy
Trinities.
True bliss
Buddhas from Thailand and China
abound in the Oriental rooms. Find the
"Reclining Buddha in the Attitude of
Nirvana" for a glimpse of true bliss, in
case you've forgotten what it's like.
Especially soothing for minds worn
and weary from too much studying are
the Oriental silk hanging scrolls, de
signed and painted to invite you into
the misty, lyrical landscapes.
The miniature carvings and
sculptures in the Frank E. Buck room
of jade defy all conceptions of mass
and matter.

The circular room of ancient art con
tains the mummy, a woman from 525
B.C. and Grecian urns, among other
relics. A room upstairs contains tin;
collections ot primitive art from
around the world.
Restless European artists of the early
2()th century discovered with joy the
simple strength of this art and used it
to give birth to a new artistic move
ment, Expressionism.
Spot Archer's target
Sadly, the room of 20th century art
lacks a good example of this cross
cultural influence, hut look lor Roy
Lichtenstein's "Bull" and its
metamorphosis into a geometrical de
sign.
Also, find Paul Manship's "Archer"
and sight along its arrow to what an
apparently accidental arrangement
provided as a target.
A mummy? That's something to
write home about. There's more to
Stanford than White Plaza and the
Sunday Flicks.
