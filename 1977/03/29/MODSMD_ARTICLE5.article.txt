# Carter stands anger Soviets

### 
Moscow (AP) — Soviet leaders
warned Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
on the first day of their nuclear arms
talks yesterday that continued U.S.
support for Russian dissidents could
jeopardize U.S.-Soviet relations.
Both Soviet party chief Leonid
Brezhnev and Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko declared that the United
States must adhere to the "principles
of noninterference in the internal af
fairs" of the Soviet Union.
If U.S. policy doesn't square with
these principles, Brezhnev told Vance
at their first meeting, "constructive
development of relations between the
two countries is impossible."
Brezhnev's comments at the
closed-door meeting and Gromyko's
toast at a subsequent lunch for Vance
were carried by the Tass news agency
and confirmed by U.S. officials.
Public attacks
The Soviet warnings were clearly
aimed at President Jimmy Carter's
public attacks on human rights viola
tions in the Soviet Union and
elsewhere. Carter's remarks have
drawn irate reactions from the Soviet
press.
At a news conference after a second
session of talks in the afternoon — this
time only with Gromyko — Vance in
dicated he had foreseen the attacks on
U.S. human rights policies and they
did not surprise him.
At first he tried to avoid saying how
he responded. Pressed by reporters, he
finally said he bad "made reference to
the fact that our human relations posi

tion springs out of fundamental values
which we hold."
Vance made it clear he now wants to
set the human rights issue aside and
concentrate on arms talks. "1 think the
air is clear" of the subject, he said.
Stressed anew
In his statements to the Soviets,
Vance stressed anew that his major
task here is to conclude a second ag
reement on strategic arms limitation
talks (SALT-2).
SALT-1, the first five-year agree
ment limiting the two superpowers'
nuclear arsenals, expires in October
and Vance is here to negotiate a new
pact.
At the afternoon session, Vance put
forward his proposals for a com
prehensive package of deep reduc
tions in each nation's nuclear force.
If this was unacceptable, Vance told
the Russians, he was prepared to agree
formally on the levels proposed at the
1974 Vladivostok summit by Brezhnev
and then-President Gerald Ford.
Vance added he would then continue
talks on a comprehensive pact.
Vance said Gromyko raised objec
tions to the comprehensive approach
as fundamentally modifying years of
past negotiations.
A preview
The foreign minister had given the
American party a preview of these ob
jections in a toast delivered earlier at
lunch for Vance.
There, Gromyko said "it is required
. . . not to reject what we managed to
achieve in this matter at the cost of
great efforts, but to lean on the founda
tions already laid. We mean the well
known Vladivostok accords achieved
by our two states at the highest level."
Before going behind closed doors,
both leaders posed for photographs
and exchanged pleasantries. Brezhnev
congratulated Vance on his 60th
birthday Sunday, and Vance offered
"warmest regards" from Carter.
According to Tass, Brezhnev
opened the talks with an "appropriate
appraisal" of U.S. foreign policy with
special stress on "those moments in
the U.S. policy which do not square
with the principles of equality, nonin
terference in the internal affairs of each
other."
Formal paper
A spokesman for Vance said the sec
retary read a formal paper reviewing
bilateral and international relations
and calling for a full range of discus
sion during the next three days of
talks.
At Gromyko's lunch, the Soviet
foreign minister said Brezhnev and
former President Richard Nixon had
agreed not to interfere in each other's
internal affairs and the United States
acceded to this principle when it
signed the Helsinki agreement in
1975.
He said the Soviet Union and its al
lies "attach tremendous importance"
to these principles and Soviet-
American relations can only develop
in accordance with them.
"It would be a serious mistake to
think and act differently," he said.
In reply, Vance expressed gratitude
for his reception and spoke of the need

to continue "the quest of reducing the
threat of war and curbing the arms
race."
Officials not sure
U.S. officials said 'hey were not sure
whether in his stress on Vladivostok,
Gromyko indicated the Soviets would
reject the U.S. proposals for a com
prehensive treaty. They pointed out
that Gromyko has also said he was
prepared to listen to any approach
made by the United States.
Informed sources believe the Garter
administration wants to limit each
country to about 1800 strategic: mis
siles and bombers, or 600 less than the
Vladivostok ceiling. The United States
is estimated to have about Z'.VZO such
missiles and bombers and the Soviet
Union about 2660.
Since Vladivostok, efforts to reach a
SAI.T-2 agreement have bogged down
because the two sides could not agree
on whether to classify the new Ameri
can cruise missile system and the
Soviet Backfire bomber as long-range
strategic weapons.

these principles, Brezhnev told Vance
at their first meeting, "constructive
development of relations between the
two countries is impossible."
Brezhnev's comments at the
closed-door meeting and Gromyko's
toast at a subsequent lunch for Vance
were carried by the Tass news agency
and confirmed by U.S. officials.
Public attacks
The Soviet warnings were clearly
aimed at President Jimmy Carter's
public attacks on human rights viola
tions in the Soviet Union and
elsewhere. Carter's remarks have
drawn irate reactions from the Soviet
press.
At a news conference after a second
session of talks in the afternoon — this
time only with Gromyko — Vance in
dicated he had foreseen the attacks on
U.S. human rights policies and they
did not surprise him.
At first he tried to avoid saying how
he responded. Pressed by reporters, he
finally said he bad "made reference to
the fact that our human relations posi

tion springs out of fundamental values
which we hold."
Vance made it clear he now wants to
set the human rights issue aside and
concentrate on arms talks. "1 think the
air is clear" of the subject, he said.
Stressed anew
In his statements to the Soviets,
Vance stressed anew that his major
task here is to conclude a second ag
reement on strategic arms limitation
talks (SALT-2).
SALT-1, the first five-year agree
ment limiting the two superpowers'
nuclear arsenals, expires in October
and Vance is here to negotiate a new
pact.
At the afternoon session, Vance put
forward his proposals for a com
prehensive package of deep reduc
tions in each nation's nuclear force.
If this was unacceptable, Vance told
the Russians, he was prepared to agree
formally on the levels proposed at the
1974 Vladivostok summit by Brezhnev
and then-President Gerald Ford.
Vance added he would then continue
talks on a comprehensive pact.
Vance said Gromyko raised objec
tions to the comprehensive approach
as fundamentally modifying years of
past negotiations.
A preview
The foreign minister had given the
American party a preview of these ob
jections in a toast delivered earlier at
lunch for Vance.
There, Gromyko said "it is required
. . . not to reject what we managed to
achieve in this matter at the cost of
great efforts, but to lean on the founda
tions already laid. We mean the well
known Vladivostok accords achieved
by our two states at the highest level."
Before going behind closed doors,
both leaders posed for photographs
and exchanged pleasantries. Brezhnev
congratulated Vance on his 60th
birthday Sunday, and Vance offered
"warmest regards" from Carter.
According to Tass, Brezhnev
opened the talks with an "appropriate
appraisal" of U.S. foreign policy with
special stress on "those moments in
the U.S. policy which do not square
with the principles of equality, nonin
terference in the internal affairs of each
other."
Formal paper
A spokesman for Vance said the sec
retary read a formal paper reviewing
bilateral and international relations
and calling for a full range of discus
sion during the next three days of
talks.
At Gromyko's lunch, the Soviet
foreign minister said Brezhnev and
former President Richard Nixon had
agreed not to interfere in each other's
internal affairs and the United States
acceded to this principle when it
signed the Helsinki agreement in
1975.
He said the Soviet Union and its al
lies "attach tremendous importance"
to these principles and Soviet-
American relations can only develop
in accordance with them.
"It would be a serious mistake to
think and act differently," he said.
In reply, Vance expressed gratitude
for his reception and spoke of the need

to continue "the quest of reducing the
threat of war and curbing the arms
race."
Officials not sure
U.S. officials said 'hey were not sure
whether in his stress on Vladivostok,
Gromyko indicated the Soviets would
reject the U.S. proposals for a com
prehensive treaty. They pointed out
that Gromyko has also said he was
prepared to listen to any approach
made by the United States.
Informed sources believe the Garter
administration wants to limit each
country to about 1800 strategic: mis
siles and bombers, or 600 less than the
Vladivostok ceiling. The United States
is estimated to have about Z'.VZO such
missiles and bombers and the Soviet
Union about 2660.
Since Vladivostok, efforts to reach a
SAI.T-2 agreement have bogged down
because the two sides could not agree
on whether to classify the new Ameri
can cruise missile system and the
Soviet Backfire bomber as long-range
strategic weapons.
Moscow (AP) — Soviet leaders
warned Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
on the first day of their nuclear arms
talks yesterday that continued U.S.
support for Russian dissidents could
jeopardize U.S.-Soviet relations.
Both Soviet party chief Leonid
Brezhnev and Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko declared that the United
States must adhere to the "principles

fairs" of the Soviet Union.

elsewhere. Carter's remarks have
drawn irate reactions from the Soviet
press.
At a news conference after a second
session of talks in the afternoon — this
time only with Gromyko — Vance in
dicated he had foreseen the attacks on
U.S. human rights policies and they
did not surprise him.
At first he tried to avoid saying how
he responded. Pressed by reporters, he
finally said he bad "made reference to
the fact that our human relations posi

tion springs out of fundamental values
which we hold."
Vance made it clear he now wants to
set the human rights issue aside and
concentrate on arms talks. "1 think the
air is clear" of the subject, he said.
Stressed anew
In his statements to the Soviets,
Vance stressed anew that his major
task here is to conclude a second ag
reement on strategic arms limitation
talks (SALT-2).
SALT-1, the first five-year agree
ment limiting the two superpowers'
nuclear arsenals, expires in October
and Vance is here to negotiate a new
pact.
At the afternoon session, Vance put
forward his proposals for a com
prehensive package of deep reduc
tions in each nation's nuclear force.
If this was unacceptable, Vance told
the Russians, he was prepared to agree
formally on the levels proposed at the
1974 Vladivostok summit by Brezhnev
and then-President Gerald Ford.
Vance added he would then continue
talks on a comprehensive pact.
Vance said Gromyko raised objec
tions to the comprehensive approach
as fundamentally modifying years of
past negotiations.
A preview
The foreign minister had given the
American party a preview of these ob
jections in a toast delivered earlier at
lunch for Vance.
There, Gromyko said "it is required
. . . not to reject what we managed to
achieve in this matter at the cost of
great efforts, but to lean on the founda
tions already laid. We mean the well
known Vladivostok accords achieved
by our two states at the highest level."
Before going behind closed doors,
both leaders posed for photographs
and exchanged pleasantries. Brezhnev
congratulated Vance on his 60th
birthday Sunday, and Vance offered
"warmest regards" from Carter.
According to Tass, Brezhnev
opened the talks with an "appropriate
appraisal" of U.S. foreign policy with
special stress on "those moments in
the U.S. policy which do not square
with the principles of equality, nonin
terference in the internal affairs of each
other."
Formal paper
A spokesman for Vance said the sec
retary read a formal paper reviewing
bilateral and international relations
and calling for a full range of discus
sion during the next three days of
talks.
At Gromyko's lunch, the Soviet
foreign minister said Brezhnev and
former President Richard Nixon had
agreed not to interfere in each other's
internal affairs and the United States
acceded to this principle when it
signed the Helsinki agreement in
1975.
He said the Soviet Union and its al
lies "attach tremendous importance"
to these principles and Soviet-
American relations can only develop
in accordance with them.
"It would be a serious mistake to
think and act differently," he said.
In reply, Vance expressed gratitude
for his reception and spoke of the need

to continue "the quest of reducing the
threat of war and curbing the arms
race."
Officials not sure
U.S. officials said 'hey were not sure
whether in his stress on Vladivostok,
Gromyko indicated the Soviets would
reject the U.S. proposals for a com
prehensive treaty. They pointed out
that Gromyko has also said he was
prepared to listen to any approach
made by the United States.
Informed sources believe the Garter
administration wants to limit each
country to about 1800 strategic: mis
siles and bombers, or 600 less than the
Vladivostok ceiling. The United States
is estimated to have about Z'.VZO such
missiles and bombers and the Soviet
Union about 2660.
Since Vladivostok, efforts to reach a
SAI.T-2 agreement have bogged down
because the two sides could not agree
on whether to classify the new Ameri
can cruise missile system and the
Soviet Backfire bomber as long-range
strategic weapons.
