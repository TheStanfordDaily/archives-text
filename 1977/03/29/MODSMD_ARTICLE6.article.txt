# Gov't., people donate $450,000
## Austrians fund professorship

A recent Austrian gift of $450,000 will be used to establish
a visiting professorship here in Austrian studies, with the
program hopefully to begin in the 1977-78 school year,
according to Ronald Herring, associate director of the Center
for Research in International Studies.
The start-up date depends on how quickly earnings ac
crue from the endowment, Herring said.
Funds for the professorship were raised through sub
scriptions which were bought by Austrians then matched
by the Austrian government.
"The Austrian people want to express their appreciation
to the U.S." for economic help under the Marshall Plan and
other postwar recovery efforts, said Manfred Mautner-
Markhof, head of the delegation which presented the
money to President Richard Lyman on March 18.
"The timing is a bit off, and I don't understand why, but
still â€” a nice gesture." said Robert Ward, director of the
center when asked later about Mautner-Markhof's state
ment.
Ward is setting up a committee to host the visiting profes
sor and coordinate the program.
"We don't expect immediate action now," Herring said.
"As soon as the funds accumulate, we will begin the screen
ing."
Herring said the endowment will yield about $25,000

annually, since part of the earnings will be reinvested to
"guarantee against the ravages of inflation."
That yield will be used to pay for plane fare and salary for
the professor, Herring explained. The yield will probably be
only enough to have the professor stay for half of each year,
he added.
The professor will be selected from a suggested pool of
names provided by the Austrians, according to Herring.
"The Austrians have access to information on scholars
that we may lack here. We may also contact various depart
ments here to decide on applicants that could provide
strong input in the program," Herring said.
Following the gathering of names, the committee, made
of German and Austrian specialists, will review the candi
dates and extend an invitation to someone to serve as the
visiting professor.
Because the position is a rotating one, the professor will
generally stay for only one term, quarter, or year. In unusual
circumstances, the professor may stay on for additional
service, according to Herring.
Language, literature, political science, history and Aust
rian sociology are the most likely areas in which the
specialist would teach. But the professor could be an expert
in the areas of physics, math, computer science or engineer
ing, according to Herring.
