## Sensationalism sells

"You furnish the pictures and I'll fur
nish the war."
—William Randolph Hearst, 1898
Read all about it — "U.S. at War with
Spain."
William Randolph Hearst's exploita
tion of the power of the press and his
ability to use yellow journalism to
push the United States into war seem
like ancient history. Yet the abuse of
the press still exists today and yellow
journalism is alive and well.
I came to this conclusion the other
day while trying to think of a way to
create higher interest among Daily
readers. The answer to my dilemma
glared at me from the front page of the
San Francisco Chronicle — "Behind
the Curtains of Broadway" (a story on
the not so legitimate "houses" in San
Francisco).
Yellow journalism, that's what
people want to read. A "successful"
columnist writes about the sensa
tional, the absurd, the extraordinary.
Give the people what they want to
hear. That sells papers.
I quickly awoke from this state of
absurd euphoria with a pang of con
science and I only then began to realize
the significance of my problem. A
journalist constantly makes ethical
judgments on how to present his mate
rial. Does he tell the facts and opinions
as they are, in direct journalistic prose,
or does he "beef it up" with elements
of surprise, sensationalistic headlines,
outrageous hyperboles, "hooks" and
in a phrase — yellow journalism?
Hearst's empire
A little more than a century after
Thomas Jefferson proclaimed the in
herent value of a free and enlightened
press, William Randolph Hearst added a
frightening new dimension to jour
nalism. Beginning with his control of
the San Francisco Examiner in 1887,
Hearst emphasized sensational, out
landish stories with glaring headlines
and illustrations for topics ranging
from violent crime and foreign affairs
to pseudo-scientific discoveries.
Examiner sales rose rapidly and
Hearst became a newspaper giant with
power and influence over other papers
as well as over public policy. Hearst's
main competitor, Joseph Pulitzer, also
resorted to this yellow journalism.
The major difference between the
two was that Pulitzer used his papers
to fight corruption in government and
to protect the poor against economic
exploitation. Hearst used his papers
for power.
The result of the Hearst/Pulitzer cir

culation wars of the 1890s was a new
breed of journalist who printed what
the public wanted to read, regardless
of its legitimacy or news value.
Fifty years went by with ups and
downs in journalistic integrity. Re
ports and papers shifted their emph
ases from honest to distorted news
items and back again. Individuals
were often victims of invasions of pri
vacy and exaggerated stories which
left them with black marks on their
characters. The public suffered but the
press survived.
McCarthy's red scare
The 1950s brought the culmination
of the conflict between writer integrity
and writer popularity. Joseph McCar
thy, Wisconsin's junior senator,
launched an all out attack against
communism and subversives.
Instead of attacking McCarthy's as
saults on human liberties, the press not
only condoned McCarthy's actions but
also helped promote his cause by giv
ing him the national coverage and at
tention he desired.
Today, Australian newspaper en
trepreneur Keith Rupert Murdoch has
shown the potential for "success" that
still lies behind sensationalism. With
an emphasis on exaggerating the truth
and exploiting the facts Murdoch has
been able to add to the sales growth
and publication monopoly that
Hearst enjoyed. Last month, Murdoch
gained control of The New York Post
and New York magazine. Again, front
cover absurdities and half truths were
the keys to success with the unfortu
nate victim being the misinformed
public.
'Woodstein' revives muckracking
The press coverage of Watergate in
the past four years has shown some
rays of hope for journalism. The
Woodward and Bernstein detective
like uncovering of White House scan
dals brought a refound glamour to
journalism and expanded a new field,
investigative reporting. There is,
however, a need for caution that goes
along with this newspaper success
story — not to fall into the trap of
exploiting the news. For over a year,
the covers of almost every magazine
and newspaper carried a headline arti
cle on Watergate until the public be
came immune to these reports and
couldn't tell a real new breakthrough
from an exaggerated one.
A free society does not yield power
to the reporters and columnists but
rather to the facts and the truth.
Woodward and Bernstein cannot be

credited with the demise of Richard
Nixon; their reporting as an instru
ment of the truth made the danger of
Watergate apparent, and the facts
forced Nixon to resign.
Reporter's duty defined
Herein lies the answer to the ques
tion — what role the press? A jour
nalist must merely report the news
clearly and logically as it is, and let the
facts bear their own testimony and
gather their own appeal.
Ironically, the role of the press was
perhaps best presented by the movie's
legendary journalism king, Charles
Foster Kane:
"I will providethepeopleofthiscity
with a daily paper that will tell all the
news honestly. I will also provide
them with a fighting and tireless
champion of their rights as citizens
and as human beings."
Kane's newspaper could not live up
to this ideal goal. Can we?
