## Beutelsbach 
### 
I wish to take this opportunity to
inform interested persons that one of
the first copies of Beutelsbach: A
Community History arrived at Stan
ford recently. What is notable about
this is that Beutelsbach was the seat of
Stanford in Germany until its extinc
tion by administrative decision as a
belt-tightening measure for the Over
seas Studies Program, and the fact that
in it are two chapters by Stanford stu
dents on folk medicine in Beutelsbach
and cultural change in the vicinity of
the town. This is probably the first
time that a local European history of
this kind has contained contributions

from American students.
It is heartwarming that while in
many parts of the world the natives are
rejecting anthropological interpreta
tions of their own communities, in this
case the natives were so enthusiastic
about it, they made it a part of their
permanent written history.
The publication of these materials in
this context is also a tribute to the ex
cellent work that Stanford students
can do.
