From April 1 through June 14, you can fly roundtrip from
New York to Luxembourg for only $410.
That's $89 less than the youth fare you'd pay on any
other scheduled airline. (From Chicago you pay $458 and
save $103.) All you have to do is be under the age of 24.
There are no booking restrictions. And no skimping on
meals or service. Because we give you the same service
you'd get from other airlines, without the same high costs.
So, if you're not flying Icelandic to Europe, you're
spending more than you have to.
We'll give you the best deal.
Save $ 89 on jet fares
to Europe and book
anytime you want.
