# ASSU cooperation needed
## 
### 
O tempore, O mores. The ASSU has
done it again. The latest conflict bet
ween the ASSU Senate and the Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) has com
pounded the confusion over who is
running the show. This time the issue
is the salaries of the four-person COP.
At the last senate meeting, a by-law
was passed which puts the salaries of
ASSU officers to a fee assessment to
be voted on each year.
The by-law is unconstitutional, for
two reasons. First, it contradicts the
ordinary procedure for initiating fee
assessments as outlined in the con
stitution. (A three-fifths majority of the
senate or a petition process is re
quired.) Second, the by-laws commit
tee which reported the bill to the se
nate did not have its necessary
quorum. Instead, Acting Senate
Chairman Brad Krevoy appointed
three "temporary" committee persons
to the by-laws committee.
The very idea of "temporary" com
mittee members, appointed by a tem
porary senate chairman, is extraordi
nary. Any pretense of objectivity was
cast aside when one of the "tempor
ary" committee persons became the
sponsor of the proposed by-law. With
no explanation of this unconstitu
tional procedure, Krevoy resigned the
chairmanship and the bill was passed.
In other words, this by-law (the
"Morrow Amendment") was rammed
through the Senate while its irregular
aspects were covered up. Neither the
senate nor the students were to learn
how cluttered the sandbox of campus
politics has become.
Restricted freedom
This year a series of legislative acts,
passed in piecemeal fashion, have re
stricted the freedom of the COP and
student organizations. The senate has
attempted to create a sense of financial
responsibility and open accounting
procedures â€” and rightly so. Too of
ten, though, the background to this at
tempt has included confusion, severe
in-fighting, and resentment.
Three competing factions in the se
nate (the conservatives, liberals,
Hammer and Coffin) find themselves

involved in more intrigue than anyone
cares to admit.
The COP reacts to this situation with
a kind of "benign neglect", or some
times with a kind of attention which
the senate considers patronizing.
At any rate, now the conflicts have
led to a by-law which threatens the
COP salaries, called the "Morrow
Amendment." If it stands, none of the
COP candidates this spring will be
able to know if they will be paid for
their services next year.*
This discourages minority students,
low/moderate income students, and
graduate students from running for of
fice. In addition, subjecting the COP
salaries to a vote suggests that the
Council of Presidents does not objec
tively deserve to be paid for its ef
forts. Yet they work at least as hard as

numerous housing associates, staff
workers, and work-study students
who are assured of financial rewards.
Finally, the by-law which subjects
the COP salaries to a vote is uncon
stitutional.
I hope these comments clarify the
murky situation. How can
anyone rely on a beleaguered COP and
a senate divided by factions? The
ASSU (recently valued at approxi
mately $1,600,000) has so much poten
tial for real action on behalf of the stu
dents, if we can restore co-operation
between the COP, the senate, and stu
dent organizations. The first step to
ward restoring cooperation is to turn
aside the unconstitutional by-law
which threatens the executive officers.
