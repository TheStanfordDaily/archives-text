The Stanford Griffins?
Amidst the continuing Cardinal-Robber
Baron-Thunderchicken-Tree-Indian debate
which has left Stanford without an officially
recognized athletic mascot or symbol, support
quietly grows for Stanford to adopt the half
lion, half-eagle creature of mythology, the grif
fin, as its mascot.
Advocates claim that the griffin represents
dignity, power and grace. Griffins are pur
ported to have been moral, intelligent creatures
that were fierce and awesome fighters, attack
ing from air and land. (Football foes take note.)
Griffin supporters have popped up around
campus wearing Griffin T-shirts purchased
through the ASSU T-Shirt Service. (Former
Stanford wrestler Chris Horpel designed the
Griffin on the shirt.)
Some alumni have taken up support of the
Griffin movement, also. Graduated track stand
outs Duncan Macdonald, American 5000-meter
record holder, and Don Kardong, an Olympic
marathoner, donned Griffin T-shirts to warmup
in before the recent Stanford Invitational Re
lays.
Other alum groups reportedly still want the
Indian returned as the Stanford mascot and fear
that support for the Griffin movement will hurt
or eliminate any possibility of the Indian being
reinstated.
Some coaches reportedly feel that the school
makes itself vulnerable to ridicule by flaunting
a lot of mascots and do not support the Griffin
movement either.
In the wake that followed President Richard
Lyman's 1972 decision to discontinue use of the
Indian as a team mascot, the Athletic Depart
ment adopted the Cardinals as a team
nickname.
The Cardinal predated the Indian as a Stan
ford monicker and represents cardinal red, the
school color.

Many Stanford athletic followers have been
dissatisfied with Cardinals saying that while a
color can he used as a nickname, it is not really a
mascot or symbol. Griffin advocates charge that
athletic supporters have a hard time rallying
around a color.
Griffin supporters argue that in addition to
the valorous symbolic qualities of their mythi
cal creature, the griffin has historical signifi
cance which makes it an appropriate mascot.
In Montalvo's Las Sergas de Esplunilian grif
fins are depicted as the secret weapons of
Califia, the mythical warrior queen of Califor
nia.
One Griffin advocate uncovered an etymol
ogy for the surname Griffin which says that the
name comes from the Roman name Hu/us,
which means red. So in a somewhat circular
way, Griffin also portrays the Stanford red.
The Griffin currently serves as the school
mascot at Canisius College, Grossmont Junior
College and several American high schools.
The idea to use this creature of fantasy came
from Stanford trainer Dave Blanchard. After
getting positive feedback from many students
and staff members, Blanchard approached the
Athletic Department administration about the
possibility of adopting the Griffin. The idea re
portedly received a cool reception.
Nonetheless, popular support for the idea
continues to grow as students and Stanford af
filiates see Griffin T-shirts around campus and
become aware of the pertinent background in
formation Griffin advocates have uncovered.
Several members of the men's swim team
took the Griffin crusade with them to the NCAA
finals in Cleveland last week, sporting the red
and white Griffin T-shirt at poolside.
The idea is catching on.
As one Griffin advocate summed up the situa
tion: "There's no way a Bear could ever beat a
Griffin."
No way.

The idea to use this creature of fantasy came
from Stanford trainer Dave Blanchard. After
getting positive feedback from many students
and staff members, Blanchard approached the
Athletic Department administration about the
possibility of adopting the Griffin. The idea re
portedly received a cool reception.
Nonetheless, popular support for the idea
continues to grow as students and Stanford af
filiates see Griffin T-shirts around campus and
become aware of the pertinent background in
formation Griffin advocates have uncovered.
Several members of the men's swim team
took the Griffin crusade with them to the NCAA
finals in Cleveland last week, sporting the red
and white Griffin T-shirt at poolside.
The idea is catching on.
As one Griffin advocate summed up the situa
tion: "There's no way a Bear could ever beat a
Griffin."
No way.

The Stanford Griffins?
Amidst the continuing Cardinal-Robber
Baron-Thunderchicken-Tree-Indian debate
which has left Stanford without an officially
recognized athletic mascot or symbol, support
quietly grows for Stanford to adopt the half
lion, half-eagle creature of mythology, the grif
fin, as its mascot.
Advocates claim that the griffin represents
dignity, power and grace. Griffins are pur
ported to have been moral, intelligent creatures
that were fierce and awesome fighters, attack
ing from air and land. (Football foes take note.)
Griffin supporters have popped up around
campus wearing Griffin T-shirts purchased
through the ASSU T-Shirt Service. (Former
Stanford wrestler Chris Horpel designed the
Griffin on the shirt.)
Some alumni have taken up support of the
Griffin movement, also. Graduated track stand
outs Duncan Macdonald, American 5000-meter
record holder, and Don Kardong, an Olympic
marathoner, donned Griffin T-shirts to warmup
in before the recent Stanford Invitational Re
lays.
Other alum groups reportedly still want the
Indian returned as the Stanford mascot and fear
that support for the Griffin movement will hurt
or eliminate any possibility of the Indian being
reinstated.
Some coaches reportedly feel that the school
makes itself vulnerable to ridicule by flaunting
a lot of mascots and do not support the Griffin
movement either.
In the wake that followed President Richard
Lyman's 1972 decision to discontinue use of the
Indian as a team mascot, the Athletic Depart
ment adopted the Cardinals as a team
nickname.
The Cardinal predated the Indian as a Stan
ford monicker and represents cardinal red, the
school color.

Many Stanford athletic followers have been
dissatisfied with Cardinals saying that while a
color can he used as a nickname, it is not really a
mascot or symbol. Griffin advocates charge that
athletic supporters have a hard time rallying
around a color.
Griffin supporters argue that in addition to
the valorous symbolic qualities of their mythi
cal creature, the griffin has historical signifi
cance which makes it an appropriate mascot.
In Montalvo's Las Sergas de Esplunilian grif
fins are depicted as the secret weapons of
Califia, the mythical warrior queen of Califor
nia.
One Griffin advocate uncovered an etymol
ogy for the surname Griffin which says that the
name comes from the Roman name Hu/us,
which means red. So in a somewhat circular
way, Griffin also portrays the Stanford red.
The Griffin currently serves as the school
mascot at Canisius College, Grossmont Junior
College and several American high schools.
