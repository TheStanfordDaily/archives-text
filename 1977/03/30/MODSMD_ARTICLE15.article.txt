# Card cindermen excel in Mexico
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
It was a successful reunion
this weekend for Payton Jordan
when he returned to the Olym
pic track facility in Mexico City
where nine years ago the Cardi
nal track mentor guided the U.S.
men's track and field delegation
to more gold medals and world
records than any group before or
since.
And although there was no
Olympic clamor nor world re
cord for Stanford's cindermen
as they competed in the Univer
sity of Mexico National Invita
tional, Card athletes capitalized
on the rarified atmosphere and
the lower gravity to record a
number of personal bests.
Junior long jumper James Lof
ton, jumping in the same pit
where Bob Beamon set his
phenomenal world record of
29-2V2, leaped 26-9 to break the
school record of 26-2V2 he estab
lished earlier in the season.
Frosh star
In the 100-meter dash
freshman Gordon Banks and
senior Marvin Holmes clocked
lifetime bests of 10.4 and 10.48
respectively. Banks' time con
verts to a 9.5 100-yard dash and
breaks the Stanford frosh mark of
9.7 which Banks had shared
with Larry Questad and Roger
Cox. The freshman from Los
Angeles also owns the frosh
220-yard record of 21.1.
Other personal bests were re
corded by high jumper John
Littleboy, 6-9; jumper Clay
Bullwinkel, 48-2V2 in the triple
jump and 23-1 in the long jump;
weight man Doug Greenwood,
53-IV2 in the shot put and

152-9V2 in the discus, and
hurdlers Tom Shellworth, 14.4
in the highs, and Mike Mon
mouth, 14.9 in the highs.
Fast foursomes
The Cardinal trackmen also
had great success in th^.relays,
running to victory in every race
entered.
Holmes, Lofton, Banks and
Sheats clocked a 39.8 in the
400-meter relay, becoming only
the second Stanford foursome to
ever eclipse 40 seconds in the
one-lap relay.
The meet featured an assort
ment of odd distance relays and
the Card cindermen proved
themselves adept at these too
winning 2400-meter relay (200-
400-800-1000), an 800-meter
relay (100-100-200-400) and a
1600-relay (200-200-400-800).
Good legs
Outstanding relay legs in
cluded a 20.9 200 split by
Holmes, a 45.9 400 by Sheats, a
1:51.9 800 by Mark Hadley and a
1000-meter leg by Steve Crowley
which Jordan termed "abso
lutely super."
The mountain air at 7300 feet
above sea level bothered the
Card distance runners although
Jeff Parietti still managed a
fourth-place finish in the
1500-meter run.
In addition to providing the
team with international experi
ence, the meet allowed Jordan to
"relive a few memories." But
more importantly, Jordan said,
the meet "will be positive in
preparing for UCLA." The
Bruins host the Cards Saturday
in Los Angeles.
