Wrestling
Junior Gary Lynn competed in
the NCAA wrestling Champion
ships at the University of Ok
lahoma over spring break losing
in the first round. Lynn was
beaten by the University of
Arizona's Steve Cooney, the
second-place finisher in the
Western Athletic Conference.
"It was enjoyable being
there," Lynn said. "I saw a lot of
good wrestling."
Since wrestling is being drop
ped next year as an intercol
legiate sport, Lynn had planned
to attend UCLA during winter
quarter for his final two seasons
of eligibility. But now that
wrestling season is over, Lynn
has decided to remain on the
Farm and says he will be content
with playing football.
"I really never had any goals
as far as national competition,"
said Lynn, who finished in the
season with a 20-6 record. "I just
wanted to win the Pac-Bs. And
this year I took second, so I'm
happy. It was fun to get to the
NCAAs."
Volleyball
Stanford's volleyball team re
turns to action after a 20-day
layoff playing three consecutive
home games this weekend.
Coach Art Lambert's Cards, 5-3
on the season, meet Chico State
Thursday, Santa Clara Friday
and Loyola of Los Angeles
Saturday. All matches begin at
7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Lambert's team is shooting for
a berth in the NCAA District-8
Regionals.
"We have an excellent oppor
tunity to participate in the reg
ionals, providing we don't lose
any more games," said Lambert.

The Cards are presently riding
on a four-game winning streak.
"In the past," he said, "the
four teams that have made the
playoffs have been Southern
California, but I think if we beat
all the teams up here, we'll show
we deserve to participate in
post-season play."
Wins over any of the Southern
California schools would en
hance Stanford's chance of land
ing a berth in the regionals. The
two remaining games with
southern schools on the Card
schedule are Loyola and Cal Poly
(April 7).
Junior Wendell Birkhofer will
be back in the Stanford lineup
this weekend, after missing ac
tion since February with a back
injury. Other starters listed by
Lambert will be seniors Tom
Duralde, Andy Fishburn and
Rich Rand, and freshmen Rod
Fletcher and Kim Lum.

Gymnastics
Sophomore Chris Takimoto
will represent Stanford in the
NCAA gymnastics champion
ships Thursday through Satur
day at Arizona State University
in Tempe.
A pommel horse specialist,
Takimoto earned a berth in the
NCAA meet by placing third in
the Pacific-8 championships.

"If Chris hits his best, he could
place in the top six," said coach
Sadao Hamada. "In the Pac-8
meet he did well in the option
als."
Hamada said Takimoto will
need good compulsaries.
"I do feel Chris is capable of
scoring a 9.6. He needs more
consistency and confidence,"
Hamada said.

Wrestling
Junior Gary Lynn competed in
the NCAA wrestling Champion
ships at the University of Ok
lahoma over spring break losing
in the first round. Lynn was
beaten by the University of
Arizona's Steve Cooney, the
second-place finisher in the
Western Athletic Conference.
"It was enjoyable being
there," Lynn said. "I saw a lot of
good wrestling."
Since wrestling is being drop
ped next year as an intercol
legiate sport, Lynn had planned
to attend UCLA during winter
quarter for his final two seasons
of eligibility. But now that
wrestling season is over, Lynn
has decided to remain on the
Farm and says he will be content
with playing football.
"I really never had any goals
as far as national competition,"
said Lynn, who finished in the
season with a 20-6 record. "I just
wanted to win the Pac-Bs. And
this year I took second, so I'm
happy. It was fun to get to the
NCAAs."
Volleyball
Stanford's volleyball team re
turns to action after a 20-day
layoff playing three consecutive
home games this weekend.
Coach Art Lambert's Cards, 5-3
on the season, meet Chico State
Thursday, Santa Clara Friday
and Loyola of Los Angeles
Saturday. All matches begin at
7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Lambert's team is shooting for
a berth in the NCAA District-8
Regionals.
"We have an excellent oppor
tunity to participate in the reg
ionals, providing we don't lose
any more games," said Lambert.

The Cards are presently riding
on a four-game winning streak.
"In the past," he said, "the
four teams that have made the
playoffs have been Southern
California, but I think if we beat
all the teams up here, we'll show
we deserve to participate in
post-season play."
Wins over any of the Southern
California schools would en
hance Stanford's chance of land
ing a berth in the regionals. The
two remaining games with
southern schools on the Card
schedule are Loyola and Cal Poly
(April 7).
Junior Wendell Birkhofer will
be back in the Stanford lineup
