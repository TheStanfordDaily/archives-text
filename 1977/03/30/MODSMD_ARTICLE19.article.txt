Vance says Soviets interested
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday that the lack of a Russian re
sponse to American proposals for a com
prehensive nuclear arms treaty might mean the
Soviets are seriously interested.
Vance told reporters at the end of his second
day of meetings in Moscow that the treaty
proposals he made Monday had not come up
once in five hours of talks with Foreign Minis
ter Gromyko.
"Indeed, I'm glad it didn't come up today,"
Vance said, "because it indicates to me that
serious consideration is being given to the
question of SALT and the proposals which
have been tabled."
More negotiations were scheduled for today,
and Vance said it was possible he might extend
his stay.
Vance said there was no "allusion to human
rights" in yesterday's talks. Soviet officials
have warned that American criticism of Soviet
handling of dissident citizens was unaccepta
ble meddling in internal affairs and could hurt
relations between the two countries.
Carter approves military aid
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has
approved more than $2 billion worth of milit
ary support contracts and NATO arms sales,
his spokesman said yesterday.
Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
picked the sales from a list of $5 billion worth
of proposals, said White House Deputy Press
Secretary Rex Granum. He said Carter, who
was critical of his predecessors for making this
country the world's number one arms mer
chant, will wait to formulate an overall arms
sales policy before deciding on the rest of the
list.
Granum said Carter still has $1.6 billion
worth of Vance-approved military sales under
consideration, and that Vance still has another
$1.4 billion in sales under review.
"Decisions . . . will be made when our policy
review is completed next month," the deputy

press secretary said.
"We are sending this $2 billion up now be
cause it is an enormous program and the Con
gress needs to get started," Granum said.
Reports differ on jet crash causes
Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Canary Islands — A
KLM jumbo jet was not cleared for takeoff
when it sped down the runway and slammed
into a Pan American jetliner in aviation's worst
disaster, Dutch and Spanish investigators said
yesterday. The crash took 575 lives.
But a Dutch investigator also claimed the
Pan American plane went beyond the point at
which it was told to pull off the main runway
and was in the wrong place when it was ram
med by the KLM jet Sunday. A Pan American
spokesman denied the claim, saying, "We
were operating with the correct procedure."
The reports relating to the collision of the
two Boeing 747s in a thick ground fog were
made as 53 of the 71 survivors flew back to the
United States aboard a U.S. Air Force plane.
Franz van Rejsen, head of the investigating
team from the Dutch Civil Aviation Authority,
said taped conversations between the control
tower and the two planes showed the KLM
pilot had been given preliminary clearance but
not final takeoff clearance.
Moonies seek contempt charges
San Francisco — Attorneys for five Moonies
asked the state Court of Appeal yesterday to
cite their parents with contempt for allegedly
disobeying an order to keep deprogrammers
away from them.
They also asked that the court's order issued
Monday be modified to suspend the temporary
conservatorships granted to the parents and to
prevent 14 deprogrammers from contacting or
communicating in any manner with the five
young followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
Pending its determination in the case, the
appellate court issued a stay of a March 24 San
Francisco Superior Court order which allowed
the parents to proceed with deprogramming of

the Moonies, whose ages range from 21 to 25.
The stay enjoined using persons or organiza
tions in an attempt to alter the religious beliefs
of the petitioners and removing them from the
court's jurisdiction.
New study downplays Pill risks
New York — Women over 40 who use birth
control pills run a much lower risk of death
from heart attacks than recent reports had
suggested — as long as they don't smoke.
But pill users in their 40s who smoke more
than 15 cigarettes a day die of heart attacks or
blood clots nearly 12 times more frequently
than those who don't smoke at all.
These were the major findings of a new study
of mortality risk and oral contraception that
was reported yesterday by research analyst
Andrudh Jain of The Population Council.
The new data analysis follows recent studies
in Great Britain and the United States that in
dicated pill users in general, and especially
those over 40, faced a much higher risk of death
and both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks than
others.
The new study, however, is not the final
word on the subject. Jain said the mortality
estimates may change as more information is
gathered, but he emphasized that future re
search should assess pill use for both smokers
and nonsmokers.
Petitions favor death penalty
Sacramento — Death penalty supporters rol
led out cans full of petitions yesterday as a sign
that the California public backs their drive to
resume use of the gas chamber.
Two days before the first legislative floor
vote on a bill to restore the death penalty, the
message was clear: opponents would be flying
in the face of public opinion.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. has promised to veto
any death penalty bill that reaches his desk.
Sen. George Deukmejian (R-Long Beach), said
the veto would "thwart the will of the people."
The bill would impose the death penalty for

treason and 15 categories of murder, including
murder of a police officer, murder during a
rape or robbery, and murder for hire.
To satisfy state and U.S. Supreme Court
guidelines, the bill would allow a jury to re
duce a sentence to life in prison because of the
circumstances of the case or a defendant's
character.
Safety caps save children
Washington — Those safety caps on aspirin
bottles may be aggravating to adults but they're
saving children's lives, according to the Con
sumer Product Safety Commission.
In 1972 there were 46 children in the United
States who died from aspirin poisoning, com

mission officials said. But three years later that
figure had dropped to 17.
Beginning in 1973, federal law required as
pirin to be packaged so that the contents were
not readily accessible to small children. Since
then other potentially harmful products have
been included in the packaging law, and offi
cials said over-all poisonings of children by
such substances have declined 47 per cent.
Today's weather
Mostly fair and continued cool today and
tomorrow. Lows tonight in the upper 30s and
40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the upper
50s and 60s.

murder of a police officer, murder during a
rape or robbery, and murder for hire.
To satisfy state and U.S. Supreme Court

circumstances of the case or a defendant's

Safety caps save children
Washington — Those safety caps on aspirin
bottles may be aggravating to adults but they're
saving children's lives, according to the Con
sumer Product Safety Commission.
In 1972 there were 46 children in the United
States who died from aspirin poisoning, com

mission officials said. But three years later that
figure had dropped to 17.
Beginning in 1973, federal law required as
pirin to be packaged so that the contents were
not readily accessible to small children. Since
then other potentially harmful products have
been included in the packaging law, and offi
cials said over-all poisonings of children by
such substances have declined 47 per cent.
Today's weather
Mostly fair and continued cool today and
tomorrow. Lows tonight in the upper 30s and
40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the upper
50s and 60s.
Vance says Soviets interested
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday that the lack of a Russian re
sponse to American proposals for a com
prehensive nuclear arms treaty might mean the
Soviets are seriously interested.
Vance told reporters at the end of his second
day of meetings in Moscow that the treaty
proposals he made Monday had not come up
once in five hours of talks with Foreign Minis
ter Gromyko.
"Indeed, I'm glad it didn't come up today,"
Vance said, "because it indicates to me that
serious consideration is being given to the
question of SALT and the proposals which
have been tabled."
More negotiations were scheduled for today,
and Vance said it was possible he might extend
his stay.
Vance said there was no "allusion to human
rights" in yesterday's talks. Soviet officials
have warned that American criticism of Soviet
handling of dissident citizens was unaccepta
ble meddling in internal affairs and could hurt
relations between the two countries.
Carter approves military aid
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has
approved more than $2 billion worth of milit
ary support contracts and NATO arms sales,
his spokesman said yesterday.
Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
picked the sales from a list of $5 billion worth
of proposals, said White House Deputy Press
Secretary Rex Granum. He said Carter, who
was critical of his predecessors for making this
country the world's number one arms mer
chant, will wait to formulate an overall arms
sales policy before deciding on the rest of the
list.
Granum said Carter still has $1.6 billion
worth of Vance-approved military sales under
consideration, and that Vance still has another
$1.4 billion in sales under review.
"Decisions . . . will be made when our policy
review is completed next month," the deputy

press secretary said.
"We are sending this $2 billion up now be
cause it is an enormous program and the Con
gress needs to get started," Granum said.
Reports differ on jet crash causes
Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Canary Islands — A
KLM jumbo jet was not cleared for takeoff
when it sped down the runway and slammed
into a Pan American jetliner in aviation's worst
disaster, Dutch and Spanish investigators said
yesterday. The crash took 575 lives.
But a Dutch investigator also claimed the
Pan American plane went beyond the point at
which it was told to pull off the main runway
and was in the wrong place when it was ram
med by the KLM jet Sunday. A Pan American
spokesman denied the claim, saying, "We
were operating with the correct procedure."
The reports relating to the collision of the
two Boeing 747s in a thick ground fog were
made as 53 of the 71 survivors flew back to the
United States aboard a U.S. Air Force plane.
Franz van Rejsen, head of the investigating
team from the Dutch Civil Aviation Authority,
said taped conversations between the control
tower and the two planes showed the KLM
pilot had been given preliminary clearance but
not final takeoff clearance.
Moonies seek contempt charges
San Francisco — Attorneys for five Moonies
asked the state Court of Appeal yesterday to
cite their parents with contempt for allegedly
disobeying an order to keep deprogrammers
away from them.
They also asked that the court's order issued
Monday be modified to suspend the temporary
conservatorships granted to the parents and to
prevent 14 deprogrammers from contacting or
communicating in any manner with the five
young followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
Pending its determination in the case, the
appellate court issued a stay of a March 24 San
Francisco Superior Court order which allowed
the parents to proceed with deprogramming of

the Moonies, whose ages range from 21 to 25.
The stay enjoined using persons or organiza
tions in an attempt to alter the religious beliefs
of the petitioners and removing them from the
court's jurisdiction.
New study downplays Pill risks
New York — Women over 40 who use birth
control pills run a much lower risk of death
from heart attacks than recent reports had
suggested — as long as they don't smoke.
But pill users in their 40s who smoke more
than 15 cigarettes a day die of heart attacks or
blood clots nearly 12 times more frequently
than those who don't smoke at all.
These were the major findings of a new study
of mortality risk and oral contraception that
was reported yesterday by research analyst
Andrudh Jain of The Population Council.
The new data analysis follows recent studies
in Great Britain and the United States that in
dicated pill users in general, and especially
those over 40, faced a much higher risk of death
and both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks than
others.
The new study, however, is not the final
word on the subject. Jain said the mortality
estimates may change as more information is
gathered, but he emphasized that future re
search should assess pill use for both smokers
and nonsmokers.
Petitions favor death penalty
Sacramento — Death penalty supporters rol
led out cans full of petitions yesterday as a sign
that the California public backs their drive to
resume use of the gas chamber.
Two days before the first legislative floor
vote on a bill to restore the death penalty, the
message was clear: opponents would be flying
in the face of public opinion.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. has promised to veto
any death penalty bill that reaches his desk.
Sen. George Deukmejian (R-Long Beach), said
the veto would "thwart the will of the people."
The bill would impose the death penalty for

treason and 15 categories of murder, including
murder of a police officer, murder during a
rape or robbery, and murder for hire.
To satisfy state and U.S. Supreme Court

These were the major findings of a new study
of mortality risk and oral contraception that
was reported yesterday by research analyst
Andrudh Jain of The Population Council.
The new data analysis follows recent studies
in Great Britain and the United States that in
dicated pill users in general, and especially
those over 40, faced a much higher risk of death
and both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks than
others.
The new study, however, is not the final
word on the subject. Jain said the mortality
estimates may change as more information is
gathered, but he emphasized that future re
search should assess pill use for both smokers
and nonsmokers.
Petitions favor death penalty
Sacramento — Death penalty supporters rol
led out cans full of petitions yesterday as a sign
that the California public backs their drive to
resume use of the gas chamber.
Two days before the first legislative floor
vote on a bill to restore the death penalty, the
message was clear: opponents would be flying
in the face of public opinion.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. has promised to veto
any death penalty bill that reaches his desk.
Sen. George Deukmejian (R-Long Beach), said
the veto would "thwart the will of the people."
The bill would impose the death penalty for

treason and 15 categories of murder, including
murder of a police officer, murder during a
rape or robbery, and murder for hire.
To satisfy state and U.S. Supreme Court
guidelines, the bill would allow a jury to re
duce a sentence to life in prison because of the
circumstances of the case or a defendant's
character.
Safety caps save children
Washington — Those safety caps on aspirin
bottles may be aggravating to adults but they're
saving children's lives, according to the Con
sumer Product Safety Commission.
In 1972 there were 46 children in the United
States who died from aspirin poisoning, com

mission officials said. But three years later that
figure had dropped to 17.
Beginning in 1973, federal law required as
pirin to be packaged so that the contents were
not readily accessible to small children. Since
then other potentially harmful products have
been included in the packaging law, and offi
cials said over-all poisonings of children by
such substances have declined 47 per cent.
Today's weather
Mostly fair and continued cool today and
tomorrow. Lows tonight in the upper 30s and
40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the upper
50s and 60s.
Vance says Soviets interested
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday that the lack of a Russian re
sponse to American proposals for a com
prehensive nuclear arms treaty might mean the
Soviets are seriously interested.
Vance told reporters at the end of his second
day of meetings in Moscow that the treaty
proposals he made Monday had not come up
once in five hours of talks with Foreign Minis
ter Gromyko.
"Indeed, I'm glad it didn't come up today,"
Vance said, "because it indicates to me that
serious consideration is being given to the
question of SALT and the proposals which
have been tabled."
More negotiations were scheduled for today,
and Vance said it was possible he might extend
his stay.
Vance said there was no "allusion to human
rights" in yesterday's talks. Soviet officials
have warned that American criticism of Soviet
handling of dissident citizens was unaccepta
ble meddling in internal affairs and could hurt
relations between the two countries.
Carter approves military aid
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has
approved more than $2 billion worth of milit
ary support contracts and NATO arms sales,
his spokesman said yesterday.
Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
picked the sales from a list of $5 billion worth
of proposals, said White House Deputy Press
Secretary Rex Granum. He said Carter, who
was critical of his predecessors for making this
country the world's number one arms mer
chant, will wait to formulate an overall arms
sales policy before deciding on the rest of the
list.
Granum said Carter still has $1.6 billion
worth of Vance-approved military sales under
consideration, and that Vance still has another
$1.4 billion in sales under review.
"Decisions . . . will be made when our policy
review is completed next month," the deputy

press secretary said.
"We are sending this $2 billion up now be
cause it is an enormous program and the Con
gress needs to get started," Granum said.
Reports differ on jet crash causes
Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Canary Islands — A
KLM jumbo jet was not cleared for takeoff
when it sped down the runway and slammed
into a Pan American jetliner in aviation's worst
disaster, Dutch and Spanish investigators said
yesterday. The crash took 575 lives.
But a Dutch investigator also claimed the
Pan American plane went beyond the point at
which it was told to pull off the main runway
and was in the wrong place when it was ram
med by the KLM jet Sunday. A Pan American
spokesman denied the claim, saying, "We
were operating with the correct procedure."
The reports relating to the collision of the
two Boeing 747s in a thick ground fog were
made as 53 of the 71 survivors flew back to the
United States aboard a U.S. Air Force plane.
Franz van Rejsen, head of the investigating
team from the Dutch Civil Aviation Authority,
said taped conversations between the control
tower and the two planes showed the KLM
pilot had been given preliminary clearance but
not final takeoff clearance.
Moonies seek contempt charges
San Francisco — Attorneys for five Moonies
asked the state Court of Appeal yesterday to
cite their parents with contempt for allegedly
disobeying an order to keep deprogrammers
away from them.
They also asked that the court's order issued
Monday be modified to suspend the temporary
conservatorships granted to the parents and to
prevent 14 deprogrammers from contacting or
communicating in any manner with the five
young followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
Pending its determination in the case, the
appellate court issued a stay of a March 24 San
Francisco Superior Court order which allowed
the parents to proceed with deprogramming of

the Moonies, whose ages range from 21 to 25.
The stay enjoined using persons or organiza
tions in an attempt to alter the religious beliefs
of the petitioners and removing them from the
court's jurisdiction.
New study downplays Pill risks
New York — Women over 40 who use birth
control pills run a much lower risk of death
from heart attacks than recent reports had
suggested — as long as they don't smoke.
But pill users in their 40s who smoke more
than 15 cigarettes a day die of heart attacks or
blood clots nearly 12 times more frequently
than those who don't smoke at all.
