## New air fares won't hurt charters 
### Sara Lessley 
Recently slashed airline prices re
sulting in "super saver fares" to New
York apparently will not seriously af
fect the ASSU Travel Service student
flights to New York, Chicago, Boston
and Washington.
"There is no evidence that the new
fares will compete in our market," said
ASSU Travel Service Manager Joe
Hess. "While some students will miss
finals in order to go home early and be
eligible for the new fares, these will be
minimal."
Hess said the time period and re
strictions on the super saver fares
would prevent students from using the
fares for summer or Christmas flights.
"Super saver fares are not only filed
from April 1 through Nov. 1 so that
they would be unavailable at Christ
mas under the present plan," said
Hess.
However, spokesmen for United
Airlines and TWA said their super
saver fares would be in effect for at
least a year, starting April 24.
Reduced prices
The new super saver fares are re
duced price round-trip flights to New
York. The idea was proposed by
American Airlines, United and TWA.
According to a TWA spokesman,
super saver fares would be "low-cost
flights" to New York only, priced dif
ferently according to the days of the
week. Prices would range from $227-
$268.
There are several restrictions when
flying on a super saver fare, the

spokesman added. A passenger has a
minimum stay of seven days and a
maximum stay of 45 days. Tickets
must be booked and paid for 30 days
prior to departure.
Super saver fares would offer
another option to students flying to
New York during Christmas, but prob
ably would not be used during the
summer because of the 45-day time re
strictions.
The ASSU would not lower prices in
any event.
"We cannot lower prices without
pricing our flights below our costs,"
said Hess. "This doesn't make sense
since it would be equivalent to paying
students a subsidy to travel on our
planes.
"Since we (ASSU) don't try to make
profits and have lower overhead, our
prices almost always come out $10-20
lower (than regular charters)."
ASSU flies cheaper
ASSU prices are presently lower
than commercial and charter flights.
The ASSU "freshman special" flight
last September flew one way from New
York to San Francisco for $106. Last
June two charters left San Francisco for
Chicago ($79) and to New York ($96),
according to Marti McCulloch, assis
tant manager of the ASSU Charter Ser
vice.
The travel service also offers char
ters at reduced rates to Hawaii in the
spring and to Boston and Washington,
D.C. at Christmas. Last Christmas, a
round trip to Boston cost $215 and a
round trip to Washington, D.C. cost

$197, McCulloch added.
Comparable prices for this year on
excursion flights offered by commer
cial airlines are $322-$344 for round
trips to Boston and $294-$314 for
round trips to Washington, D.C. On
both of these flights there is a
minimum stay of seven days and a
maximum stay of 30 days, said a
spokesman for United Airlines.
Regular excursion and coach fares
round trip to New York range from
$309-$412, according to a TWA
spokesman.
Charter flights to New York range
from $179-$ l 99, with the higher prices
going into effect during the summer,
said Denise Sanguinetti, a spokesman
for the Roos Atkins World Travel
Bureau. Charters must be booked and
paid for 30 days in advance and round
trips are available only for stays of 11,
18 or 25 days.
