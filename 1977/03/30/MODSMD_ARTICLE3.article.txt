Business is picking up for the library
bus service between the University
and UC-Berkeley, according to Ann
Seeley, coordinator of the UCB-
Stanford Research Library Cooperative
Program.
The service, which began March 1,
drew a low turnout during the spring
break, said Seeley, but the buses are
now carrying as many as 25 or 30 per
sons per trip.
Any member of the Stanford com
munity may ride the bus on a first
come, first-served basis after present
ing a university identification card,
said Seeley.
However, only faculty and academic
staff members or doctoral candidates
are allowed to obtain a UC-Berkeley
library card or use the library exchange
services, she said.
If the bus service proves to be popu
lar, said Seeley, library privileges may
be extended to all graduate students.
However, she said, the extension
would not be made before winter quar
ter.
She pointed out that all students are
eligible for temporary library cards,
which allow the use of materials on an

in-house basis.
Funded by the Mellon and Sloan
foundation, the bus service is
scheduled to continue for three years,
according to Seeley. Tht service is
often used by students going to Ber
keley for the weekend, she said. Using
the bus for a non-library visit is fine,
she said, as long as there is room on the
bus.
According to a library spokesman,
two buses make the IV2-hour inter
campus trip four times daily. The
buses leave from the side of the Main
Library (between the library and the art
building) at 8:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 1
p.m. and 3:15 p.m.
Persons with library privileges may
make reservations for seats on the fl:30
and 3:15 buses.
Stanford persons interested in ob
taining a Berkeley library card should
complete a registration form available
at the service desk in the Cecil H.
Green Library (formerly known as the
Main Library). The card can be ob
tained through the service desk staff
here or by taking the validated form to
the main service desk at Berkeley.
Berkeley program card holders are
eligible for many of the Berkeley lib
rary and reference services.
