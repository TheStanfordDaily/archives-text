# Branner cook fired
## USE decries dismissal 
### Bill Burger 
A petition to "protect the job" of
fired Branner Hall cook Lindsey
Taylor was circulated Monday at
Maples Pavilion by students.
I he petition, originating with Un
ited Stanford Employees (USE), Local
680, Service Employees International
Union, also intends to "expose Janice
Marks (Branner Food Service man
ager) as an inexperienced supervisor"
and to show her "inability" to relate
wel 1 to workers in the Branner kitchen,
according to Jim Berk, former USE
president.
Taylor was fired on March 10 while
a plainclothes Stanford policeman
waited in an unmarked police car out
side Branner Hall, according to Berk.
Edward Scoles, director of Univer
sity housing, who was involved in the
decision to have a policeman on the
scene, called the action a "precautio
nary measure." He added that he had
nothing else to say.
Taylor has no record of violence, ac
cording to USE president Anne
Schlagenhaft.
Dismissal letter
Berk said the letter of dismissal
given to Taylor cited eight separate
"incidents of willful disobedience"
and a "refusal to follow directions" as
the reasons for his firing. The letter
was signed by Marks, he added.
Berk said that the allegations are
solely Marks' and he called the situa
tion "outrageous." He and USE charge
Marks with "insensitivity to workers,
especially black and brown ones."
Marks refused to comment on the
firing, saying that the situation was
one strictly "between the management
and Lindsey."
Maxine Anderson, manager of the
University food service, said the case
was one that "should not be gone
into," and said she had no comment
for reporters.
Minor disputes between Taylor and
Marks began in November and con
tinued until the firing in March.
Taylor, 34 and a Stanford employe
for seven years, said Marks has "been
on my case from the start."
He said she is an "incompetent"
supervisor, and knows nothing of the
needs of the cook and kitchen staff.
Suspended
Taylor was suspended without pay
on Dec. 8 and told by Marks to return
on the 13. This was a total of 2 x /i days of
suspension. The reason given by
Marks for the suspension was that
Taylor was 15 minutes late for work
one day, said Berk. Taylor said he and
his wife had car trouble that day and
were unable to get him to work on
time.
After the suspension, Berk or

ganized a meeting of students, union
officials and Taylor. The main purpose
of the meeting, according to Berk, was
to give the students a means of voicing
their complaints concerning Branner
food, which had been declining in
quality, according to many Branner re
sidents. The meeting was also de
signed to help generate support for
Taylor, said Berk.
According to Berk, this was the first
time USE had ever tried to involve stu
dents in union matters.
Students organized a group shortly
after the meeting with Berk and dis
cussed the Taylor case with Anderson,
Marks and Taylor himself, according

to Branner resident Jim Isaacs.
Marks, hired in September, has no
experience as a professional cook and
came to Stanford after working as a
social worker, said Berk.
According to Schlagenhaft, Marks
"is disliked by most workers and
hashers in Branner."
Schlagenhaft said several hashers
have quit or decided not to return to
work at Branner because of the situa
tion there. Finlay Waugh, one of two
hashers who quit on the day Taylor
was fired, agreed. Waugh, a sopho
more, described Marks' handling of
the kitchen as "strict" and as having
"no sense behind it."
