# U.S., Cuba parleyed before Angola crisis
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Until Cuba
moved troops into Angola, the United
States and Castro government rep
resentatives met for about a year in sec
ret on establishing normal relations.
At the high-level meetings, at air
ports and in a New York hotel, "we
catalogued the range of issues out
standing between the United States
and Cuba," said William Rogers, a
principal American participant.
Except for one brief session, the talks
ended with Cuba's military interven
tion in September 1975, in the Ango
lan Civil War.
However, knowledgeable sources
here said Cuba's support for a Marxist
faction was only one of several possi
ble reasons for the dialogue coming to
an end.
Others, the sources said, included
apparent differences within the gov
ernment in Havana on how far to go
toward resuming relations with
Washington. Also, there was the grow
ing prospect that a Democratic ad
ministration would come to power
here and be more favorably disposed
toward a renewal of ties.
'Explaining*
Rogers, then assistant secretary of
state for Latin American affairs, said in
an interview that "what we were doing
was explaining, as Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger had said publicly,
that hostility was not a permanent part
of our policy."
The talks, described by Rogers as
"exploratory," were treated as confi
dential. They became known publicly
after the Carter administration au
thorized the current round now under
way in New York on fishing rights and
maritime boundaries. Those talks were

announced last week by the State De
partment.
Sources said that as a result of the
meetings and other contacts by a hand
ful of U.S. senators, some dozens
Americans held in Cuba on drug
related charges were released and the
United States moved to support lifting
of economic and diplomatic sanctions
by the Organization of American
States against Cuba.
Expanded travel
The talks also covered expanded
travel for Cuban diplomats in the Un
ited States and the eventual removal of
barriers to trade by foreign-based sub
sidiaries of American business firms.
When the current fishing talks were
announced by the State Department
last Friday, they were generally be
lieved to be the first known meetings
between the two nations since the Un
ited States suspended relations in
January 1961.
The earlier round was begun in
November 1974 with a telephone call
by Lawrence Eagleburger, a close aide
to Kissinger, to the Cuban mission at
the United Nations explaining the
Ford administration's interest in meet
ing with Cuban diplomats.
The two countries have imposed
200-mile fishing zones causing an
overlap of 200,000 square miles that
must be resolved. Besides fishing
rights, U.S. and Cuban representatives
are expected to discuss at an early date
extension of an anti-hijacking agree
ment that has dissuaded terrorists
from diverting planes to Cuba.

and Cuba," said William Rogers, a
principal American participant.
Except for one brief session, the talks
ended with Cuba's military interven
tion in September 1975, in the Ango
lan Civil War.
However, knowledgeable sources
here said Cuba's support for a Marxist
faction was only one of several possi
ble reasons for the dialogue coming to
an end.
Others, the sources said, included
apparent differences within the gov
ernment in Havana on how far to go
toward resuming relations with
Washington. Also, there was the grow
ing prospect that a Democratic ad
ministration would come to power
here and be more favorably disposed
toward a renewal of ties.
'Explaining*
Rogers, then assistant secretary of
state for Latin American affairs, said in
an interview that "what we were doing
was explaining, as Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger had said publicly,
that hostility was not a permanent part
of our policy."
The talks, described by Rogers as
"exploratory," were treated as confi
dential. They became known publicly
after the Carter administration au
thorized the current round now under
way in New York on fishing rights and
maritime boundaries. Those talks were

announced last week by the State De
partment.
Sources said that as a result of the
meetings and other contacts by a hand
ful of U.S. senators, some dozens
Americans held in Cuba on drug
related charges were released and the
United States moved to support lifting
of economic and diplomatic sanctions
by the Organization of American
States against Cuba.
Expanded travel
The talks also covered expanded
travel for Cuban diplomats in the Un
ited States and the eventual removal of
barriers to trade by foreign-based sub
sidiaries of American business firms.
When the current fishing talks were
announced by the State Department
last Friday, they were generally be
lieved to be the first known meetings
between the two nations since the Un
ited States suspended relations in
January 1961.
The earlier round was begun in
November 1974 with a telephone call
by Lawrence Eagleburger, a close aide
to Kissinger, to the Cuban mission at
the United Nations explaining the
Ford administration's interest in meet
ing with Cuban diplomats.
The two countries have imposed
200-mile fishing zones causing an
overlap of 200,000 square miles that
must be resolved. Besides fishing
rights, U.S. and Cuban representatives
are expected to discuss at an early date
extension of an anti-hijacking agree
ment that has dissuaded terrorists
from diverting planes to Cuba.
Washington (AP) — Until Cuba
moved troops into Angola, the United
States and Castro government rep
resentatives met for about a year in sec
ret on establishing normal relations.
At the high-level meetings, at air
ports and in a New York hotel, "we
catalogued the range of issues out
standing between the United States
and Cuba," said William Rogers, a
principal American participant.
