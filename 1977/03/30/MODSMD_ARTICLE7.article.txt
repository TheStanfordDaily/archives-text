# Filing error delays beer license OK
## 
### Mark Schleiss 
State approval of a license to sell
beer at Encina Commons has been de
layed because of a mistake in the origi
nal application, according to Bob
Caselli, director of TDS food services.
Caselli said the license would have
been granted by now if the application
had not listed Palo Alto as the location
of Encina Commons instead of Stan
ford.
"We should have had the license in
our hands by now," Caselli said, "but
detection of this error means a delay of
30 days while a corrective application
is submitted."
TDS originally applied for the
license and posted notice of its intent
on Feb. 1. Because the error was spot
ted in the middle of March, said
Caselli, the earliest date the license can
now be approved is April 19.
'Red tape'
Caselli said the additional applica
tion was only a technicality of
"bureaucratic red tape" and approval
of the license would not pose a prob
lem.
"We did not receive any protests in
the 30-day posting period, and from
what the (state alcoholic beverage con
trol) commission tells me, it's just a
matter of course until we get the
license."
TDS is applying for an on-sale
license, which means that any beer
sold would have to be drunk on the
premises. The license would not re
strict minors from using the Com
mons.
"All students under age 21 would
continue to use Encina Commons,"
Caselli said. "The only restriction of an
on-sale license would be the condition
that no beer could be taken out of the
facility."
Caselli said there was no way of
knowing how long it would take the
State Commission to process the
supplementary correction application
after the one-month waiting period.
