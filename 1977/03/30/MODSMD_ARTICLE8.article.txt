## Opinions Energy policy threatening 
### 
Within three weeks, the Carter ad
ministration will launch the nation
toward its most direful rendevous with
regulation. It will propose an energy
use policy promising a drastic impact
on the lifestyle of virtually every
American.
Reports from the office of energy
"czar" James Schlesinger presage an
attempt by the lords of Washington to
use a very real energy dilemma as an
excuse for enacting more stringent
legislation of the type which caused
much of the problem in the first place.
This round of controls will be even
more pernicious, however. Instead of
affecting the nation's consumers indi
rectly through manipulation of pro
ducers, as past federal forays into
energy have done, the Carter controls
will attack consumption directly.
Thus, we are faced with the pros
pect, in a figurative if not literal sense,
of energy brown-shirts invading every
home and place of business in
America, demanding conformity to
the fuel-use dictates of an all-knowing
political bureaucracy.
Many appear ready to accept such an
infringement upon their liberties.
With the help of the media, whose bent
for regulation derives from their
simplistic acceptance of the govern
ment as a problem-solver rather than a
problem-causer, and several large
energy firms, which perpetually use
government as a means for stifling
competitors and subsidizing their own
ventures, Washington has made the
case for a "national energy policy"
seem compelling in many minds.
Masochistic mentality
The masochistic mentality on which
controllers depend, the common
suffering ideal that is represented cur
rently in the perverse appeals for a re
turn to the "good* old World War II
spirit of sacrifice," must be recognized
if one is to explain why the regulating
bureaucracy, already knee deep in the
Big Muddy, pushes us onward. The
government is unable to create wealth,
but is most able to dish out misery.
The greatest tragedy of any decline
in our standard of living we face in this
generation is not that it may occur, but
that it is so unnecessary. Unnecessary,
that is, if we would return to a free

market in energy, instead of relying for
"solutions" on the same people who
caused the problem in the first place.
Is this an era of natural shortages, as
the regulators tell us? No, says the Na
tional Commission on Supplies and

Shortages, created in 1974: "The
geologic, economic and demographic
evidence indicates no physical lack of
resources will seriously strain our
economic growth for the next quarter
century and probably for generations
thereafter."
No, says University of Texas Prof.
John McKetta, an energy specialist:
"The tragedy of our problem is that the
crisis is developing even though ex
pert scientific studies indicate there
are sufficient domestic resources of
crude oil and natural gas to last for the
foreseeable future ..."
Price controls
As the natural gas shortage this
winter demonstrated so strikingly, the
best way to keep those supplies from
being realized is price control, which
also impedes voluntary conservation.
An MIT study shows that Americans
pay 36 per cent less than the true mar
ket price for energy, causing demand
to be eight per cent higher than it
naturally would, and supply six per
cent lower.
Horror stories about price increases
which would follow decontrol are
exaggerated, however. Two separate
studies show that lifting the wellhead
ceiling on natural gas prices would in
crease consumer prices for that fuel
some six per cent a year; it would also
limit the need for expensive substi
tutes such as synthetic and liquified
natural gas. Indeed, a Federal Energy
Administration (FEA) study shows

home fuel bills actually would be less
under decontrol than under current
and proposed control plans.
Further, a Rand Corporation study
notes that decontrol of gasoline pump
prices would have a negligible effect
on consumers, but would reshuffle $6
billion within the petroleum industry,
rewarding efficient producers.
Total price decontrol is not the only
step needed to bring energy to the na
tion. We must free producers from the
contradictory and short-sighted edicts
of states which restrict off-shore dril
ling, of judges who stop power plants
in mid-construction because of threats
to obscure species of fish, and of reg
ulators who inhibit coal production at
the same time they demand more of it.
Abolish FEA
We should abolish the FEA, which
since its creation five years ago (as the
Federal Energy Office) has caused
gluts and shortages of different fuels in
different areas, and has rewarded inef
ficient producers through various
"share the resource" programs. It now
employs 112 people in its press office
and spends $3.5 million to publish
coloring-book propaganda claiming
that the agency is the best thing since
Santa Claus.
Such buffoonery would be laugha
ble, were these officials not empo
wered to throttle the energy lifeline of
the nation. But they and others are so
able, and energy users throughout
America soon will be asked to pay for
these "experts' " mistakes.
There is nothing mystical about the
energy industry. It responds to the
same market forces as does every other
type of business (and so does the OPEC
cartel that exists within it). And like
any other industry, it can be destroyed
by a baffling and changing set of regu
lations and a lack of reward to produc
ers.
That is exactly what has happened.
Yet the political mentality is for more
controls, not fewer. An incredible re
mark by Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd, endorsing Carter's forced
conservation ideas, sums up the at
titude. Said Byrd, "We can't depend
on voluntarism anymore."
