# Letter: Admissions policies
## 
### 
The letter submitted by Steven
Hansch and Don Moonshine on behalf
of the Stanford Coalition Against the
Bakke Decision, and published Daily,
Mar. 28 includes two statements
bearing directly on the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aids, (CUAFA) and on the Of
fice of Admissions. As chairman of
that committee, I believe myself ob
liged to respond to the errors involved
in each.
The first: "... CUAFA cannot over
come the subtle racism of Dean Harga
don ..." 1 read this to mean that the
committee has attempted to overcome
the racism of the Dean, and that racism
is an acknowledged fact. Wrong on
both counts. Never has the charge of
racism, nor the word, been introduced
to committee discussions in the two
years of my association with the com
mittee. 1 do not believe the Dean a ra
cist, nor to my knowledge does any
other member of the committee.
Wisely enough, CUAFA has not at

tempted to overcome anything it has
not, as a matter of record, believed to
exist.
The second: "... minority admis
sions will be regressed by self
help price increases . . . "This year the
committee did in fact vote to increase
the amount of self-help for each stu
dent receiving financial aid at the Uni
versity, whether that student was a
member of an ethnic minority or not. It
did so the year before. No evidence
exists to show that last year's increase
had any negative impact on the
number of minority applicants to Stan
ford, nor on the number admitted, nor
on the number of those choosing to
come to the University this year. Nor
was the increase at Stanford out of
proportion to increases at other private
universities in this country. Moreover,
the amount of self-help being asked of
students here continues to compare
quite favorably with that asked at those
other universities. By its vote, the

committee has expressed the same
understanding about the increase for
1977-78.
The letter from the Coalition also
says that "... the admissions office at
Stanford is committed to perpetuating
the elite structure of society ..." This
is an old and corrupt argument. That
office actually has very little purchase
on the structure of society. Indeed, it is
limited to a very small zone of Ameri
can life. His commitment is to admit
some 1500 students to a university
which is, in turn, committed to intel
lectual excellence. Hence it admits
those students it judges are best pre
pared, and most likely to benefit from,
the courses offered. The students turn
out to be wealthy and poor, and of
many different ethnic backgrounds.
The office considers them all to be
"advantaged" in the most serious edu
cational sense of that term.
