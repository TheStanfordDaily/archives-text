# Student codirector positions open for SCIRE, SWOPSI programs
## 
### Sara Lessley 
When SCIRE and SWOPSI added
student codirectors last year, "it was
an extremely positive change" for the
programs, according to SCIRE profes
sional codirector Maria Chacon.
Today at noon in the SWOPSI and
SCIRE office, all undergraduates and
coterminal students interested in
being student codirector of either
SWOPSI or SCIRE next year will meet
with this year's student codirectors.
Adding student codirectors has
"provided an effective and valuable
way for SCIRE and SWOPSI to main
tain contact with student needs and
interests," said Chacon.
This year's SCIRE codirector, Janet
Shaver, said, "by being a student my
self. I am in closer contact with stu
dents and can get them in contact with
the program."
Most important part
Getting information and ideas from
students and to students, has probably
been the most important part of my
work, Shaver added.
She said she has planned much of
the publicity for SCIRE, including out
reaches to dorms to tell students about
designing a major or getting credit for
an individual project.
As student codirectors, both Shaver
and Tom Graham (SWOPSI) work with
the part time professional codirectors,
Chacon and Alice Supton (SWOPSI).
This makes a "nice balance," Shaver
said. A student codirector is more
aware of student interests while a pro
fessional codirector tends to have
more experience in higher education
and administration, Shaver said. The
student codirector works closely with
the professional codirector, however,
and many of their duties overlap.
Shares duties
The SWOPSI student codirector
shares duties with the professional
codirector including organizing and
coordinating public events such as the
McCloskey/Harris debates last fall. The
codirector also works with the
SWOPSI Policy Board, students, the

University and community.
This year, Graham helped SWOPSI
organize workshops on topics such as
recycling, energy conservation and
DNA research.
The SCIRE student codirector will
administer the program with the pro
fessional codirector.
The student codirector's duties in
clude organizing task forces to inves
tigate problems of undergraduate edu
cation, helping students design pro
jects for credit, coordinating projects
for improving the life of under
graduates here and arranging for off
campus learning experiences, such as
SCIRE's internship program.
Interviewed
Candidates will be interviewed
early spring quarter by students and
faculty members of the SCIRE and
SWOPSI Policy Board and representa
tives from the Office of Undergraduate
Studies.
The final selection will be made by
midquarter so new directors will have
a chance to be "acclimated to the of
fice," Shaver said.
The only formal prerequisite is that
prospective codirectors be under
graduates next year, Shave, said. De
sirable qualities include a knowledge
of Stanford, an interest in organiza

tion, leadership, alternative education
and — for the SWOPSI codirector —
some awareness of local political and
social issues.
Codirectors devote 20 hours a week
to their job, arranged around their
class schedules. The salary is about $4
an hour, Shaver said.
'Not a breeze'
"It's not a breeze," Shaver added,
"it's a large commitment of time and
energy."
She said she and Graham recom
mend prospective codirectors try to
carry only about 12 units.
Shaver said she has gained a lot of
experience in her position as SCIRE

codirector.
"You get to work with really moti
vated people, with their ideas . . . and
there is real satisfaction in helping
people do what they want to do.
"The job is very open, requiring you
to be creative and flexible," Sbaver
added.
"I've become convinced that social
and political change is alive at Stan
ford," Graham said. "I've been able to
get projects going and thereby help di
rect the emphasis of that change.
"The potential for organizing work
shops and public events that can ac
complish concrete objectives is unli
mited."

more experience in higher education
and administration, Shaver said. The
student codirector works closely with
the professional codirector, however,
and many of their duties overlap.
Shares duties
The SWOPSI student codirector
shares duties with the professional
codirector including organizing and
coordinating public events such as the
McCloskey/Harris debates last fall. The
codirector also works with the
SWOPSI Policy Board, students, the

University and community.
This year, Graham helped SWOPSI
organize workshops on topics such as
recycling, energy conservation and
DNA research.
The SCIRE student codirector will
administer the program with the pro
fessional codirector.
The student codirector's duties in
clude organizing task forces to inves
tigate problems of undergraduate edu
cation, helping students design pro
jects for credit, coordinating projects
for improving the life of under
graduates here and arranging for off
campus learning experiences, such as
SCIRE's internship program.
Interviewed
Candidates will be interviewed
early spring quarter by students and
faculty members of the SCIRE and
SWOPSI Policy Board and representa
tives from the Office of Undergraduate
Studies.
The final selection will be made by
midquarter so new directors will have
a chance to be "acclimated to the of
fice," Shaver said.
The only formal prerequisite is that
prospective codirectors be under
graduates next year, Shave, said. De
sirable qualities include a knowledge
of Stanford, an interest in organiza

tion, leadership, alternative education
and — for the SWOPSI codirector —
some awareness of local political and
social issues.
Codirectors devote 20 hours a week
to their job, arranged around their
class schedules. The salary is about $4
an hour, Shaver said.
'Not a breeze'
"It's not a breeze," Shaver added,
"it's a large commitment of time and
energy."
She said she and Graham recom
mend prospective codirectors try to
carry only about 12 units.
Shaver said she has gained a lot of
experience in her position as SCIRE

codirector.
"You get to work with really moti
vated people, with their ideas . . . and
there is real satisfaction in helping
people do what they want to do.
"The job is very open, requiring you
to be creative and flexible," Sbaver
added.
"I've become convinced that social
and political change is alive at Stan
ford," Graham said. "I've been able to
get projects going and thereby help di
rect the emphasis of that change.
"The potential for organizing work
shops and public events that can ac
complish concrete objectives is unli
mited."

When SCIRE and SWOPSI added
student codirectors last year, "it was
an extremely positive change" for the
programs, according to SCIRE profes
sional codirector Maria Chacon.
Today at noon in the SWOPSI and
SCIRE office, all undergraduates and
coterminal students interested in
being student codirector of either
SWOPSI or SCIRE next year will meet
with this year's student codirectors.
Adding student codirectors has
"provided an effective and valuable
way for SCIRE and SWOPSI to main
tain contact with student needs and
interests," said Chacon.
This year's SCIRE codirector, Janet
Shaver, said, "by being a student my
self. I am in closer contact with stu
dents and can get them in contact with
the program."
Most important part
Getting information and ideas from
students and to students, has probably
been the most important part of my
work, Shaver added.
She said she has planned much of
the publicity for SCIRE, including out
reaches to dorms to tell students about
designing a major or getting credit for
an individual project.
As student codirectors, both Shaver
and Tom Graham (SWOPSI) work with
the part time professional codirectors,
Chacon and Alice Supton (SWOPSI).
This makes a "nice balance," Shaver
said. A student codirector is more
aware of student interests while a pro
fessional codirector tends to have
more experience in higher education
and administration, Shaver said. The
student codirector works closely with
the professional codirector, however,
and many of their duties overlap.
