# City balks on drug services
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The Palo Alto City Council has
passed a resolution saying the
city should "play no role in drug
abuse services at this time." The
measure was adopted alter the
Policy and Procedures Commit
tee recommended such action to
the council.
The second section of the
measure accused the county of a
lack of coordination among drug
abuse agencies and encouraged
them to review the matter.
Councilmember John Berwald
said he did not think the prog
ram was poorly organized but
only that there had been impro
per allocation of funds to each
area of the county. He amended
the motion to indicate this.
Councilmember Scott Carey
concurred with Berwald saying,
"I'm tired of sending one dollar
down to the county and getting
six cents back."
Another section of the mea
sure, encouraged council rep
resentatives to discuss the coun
cil's concern about proposed

cutbacks in the school district's
drug counseling program.
Councilmember kirke Comstock
questioned whether this was ap
propriate considering the city's
"zero commitment" to such
programs. Byron Slier, another
councilmember said some per
sons from the school district had
expressed concern when the city
discontinued its drug program.
The section, however, remained
intact.
In a related matter, the Policy
and Procedures Committee
chose to make no recommenda
tion concerning the contract
with Narconon, an agency con
tracted by the city to set up and
run a drug treatment program.
Their contract was terminated
on Jan. 5 of this year after the city
decided the program had been
ineffective. Councilman Scott
Carey said since the committee
did not make any recommenda
tion the council could "take it as
a negative referal." The council
took no action to reinstate the
program.
