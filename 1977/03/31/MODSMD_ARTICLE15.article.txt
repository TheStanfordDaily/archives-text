# Getting straight in San Mateo County
## 
### Malinda Elliott 
Outside the spacious dining room where a gioup ol
prisoners were meeting, January sunlight hrig itened
the lush lawn and reflected off a row of trim, newly
painted, grey barracks. A cool breeze blew the forest
smell of pine through the camp.
The setting looked more like a boy scout retreat than
a San Mateo County correction facility. At the Sheriff s
Honor Camp in the redwood-studded hills above I'os
cadero, the inmates were holding their weekly rriclay
afternoon meeting.
About 85 people were there — 75 of them inmates.
Most of the prisoners were young — under JO and
the majority were between 19 and 23. They were not a
particularly unusual looking bunch. fliere were
whites, blacks, chicanos; many wore mustaches or
beards. Everyone wore sturdy denim suits, with jackets
lined with synthetic fur, stamped "HC l' or Honor
Camp) on the back.
No bars
The Honor Camp is a minimum security facility. No
bars, no fences. At group meetings, probation officers,
rehabilitation officers, camp staff and official visitors
mix with inmates, sitting wherever they like-
That day, in the back row, a tall, dark-haired man
wearing jeans and an embroidered shirt lounged com
fortably with the inmates. Toward the end of the meet
ing, he was introduced by the presiding deputy as Dan
Veenstra, a representative from the Service League of
San Mateo County.
Veenstra explained briefly that any inmate who
wanted to talk to him could meet with hini that after
noon, and then settled back in his chair to watch the
rest of the proceedings.
During his visit that day, several inmates did talk to
Veenstra. So did Mike McQueen, a probation officer,
and Frank Gordon, the new lieutenant in charge of
Honor Camp.
Rubbing elbows with convicts, and with their keep
ers, is part of Veenstra's job. For the past year, he has
headed the correctional services department of the
Service League, a low-profile agency that helps in

mates in San Mateo County jails.
Communicating comes easy to Veenstra, whose pro
fession used to be sales. As he sees it, his job is to tell
prisoners what his organization can do for them, and
make it sound interesting to inmates who most likely
have become so imbued with negativity that positive
interaction with any person or institution may seem
next to impossible.
But Veenstra's talent for sales would be lost if he did
not have a product worth something to inmates —
which he does.
According to the Service League's Executive Direc
tor, Bill Flegge, the agency's goal is to offer inmates
help on two levels; if they don't need aid on one, they
probably do on the other.
First, the league wants to provide services that give
inmates emotional support, the kind of support it takes
for a human being to make a major change against
staggering obstacles. Second, the agency offers practi
cal services to make the daily hassle of being incarcer
ated simpler to deal with.
Five years ago, the Service League of San Mateo
County was following the footsteps of its parent or
ganization, Service League of Northern California; it
was offering one kind of assistance — counseling — to
inmates. The league had a two-person staff then.
Range of programs
Shortly after Flegge came on board he began to build
up the range of programs. To reach more prisoners, the
league needed manpower, and so it recruited a staff of
volunteers — several hundred of them — from the
community.
Programs were expanded to include everything from
emergency services — such as delivering a bag of
groceries to an inmate's family if the welfare check did
not arrive —to completely new services, such as send
ing a volunteer to collect prisoners' scribbled messages
from the main jail each day and having volunteers
phone them to the family, friends, or business that
prisoners needed to reach.
The league now employes 12 salaried staff members.
But the backbone of the agency is the more than 300

volunteers from the community. They provide trans
portation for inmates' families, visit spouses, work in a
"pals" program with the children of inmates, visit in
mates in jail, tutor prisoners working for high school
diplomas and teach women inmates sewing and crafts.
Elizabeth Gheleta, who heads the agency's volunteer
program, says that she views one of the league's main
funcitons as "knowing where to turn" when an inmate
needs help, so that even when the league cannot meet
his needs, it finds someone who can.
Not everyone at Service League has a success story to
tell. Recidivism rates remain high. Many times volun
teers know that prisoners because of their "loser" men
tality are doing nothing to help themselves. Some pris
oners, being expert con artists, try to take anyone offer
ing a helping hand for a ride.
Still, at a meeting where he was explaining the basics
of how to establish a personal relationship with an
inmate to three new volunteers, Veenstra was en
thusiastic about the results that psychological support
sometimes brings. "Our reward is that every once in a
while we get someone who does amazing things— just
because we give him support."
Veenstra says he believes that much of the good the
league does may be the result of the raised awareness of
the criminal justice system gained by volunteers.
"When you get to know some of these people," lit! tells
volunteers, "you'll shake your head and say: 'Oh, Char
lie, did you really do that?' You'll see that in many
ways they are just average people. You II understand
the criminal justice system better, and you just might
find that you read the newspaper very differently after
you've had this One-to-One experience."
The attitude at the League's small, Victorian office
building on Middlefield Road in Redwood City — right
across the street from the stark, modern structure of the
main jail — remains consistently positive and deter
mined. "Maybe people like doing this kind of work
because it's a challenge," said Veenstra. "And maybe
some day someone will come up with a better way to
handle tbe problems in criminal corrections because of
some of the experiences they've had here."
