# Reporters unearth evidence in Arizona scandal
## 
### 
(AP) — Published accounts of
a series by a team of investigative
reporters say that Lake Havasu
City, Ariz., is becoming an "out
post for organized crime fi
gures," many of whom moved
west from Rochester, N.Y.
The stories said that Lake
Havasu City, a 14-year-old unin
corporated community, also is
"a safe haven for thugs and
thieves."
It has no police force and the
published accounts quoted in
vestigator Joe Chapin of the
sheriff's office as saying: "We
don't have the manpower and
the equipment to know what
these people are really up to. But
we know they are here. Some
times it seems like most of the
Rochester chapter of the Mafia
lives along the river."
The stories appeared in the
Wednesday editions of the In
dianapolis Star and the Al
buquerque Journal and some
other papers, available Tuesday
night. They were based on the
lHth installment of a 23-part
copyright series by Investigative
Reporters and Editors, Inc.,
which sponsored a team probe of
organized crime in Arizona.
Accounts of what was pre
sented as a sidebar to the main
installment said. "An IRE inves
tigation . . . shows that the city
. . . resulted from a massive land
grab that will earn McCulloch
Corp., the developer more than
$30 million" since 1963.
Rick Stephens, president of
Chamber of Commerce Lake
Havasu City, issued a statement
today criticizing the stories.
"The team of investigative re
porters and editors now have at
tempted to smear the good repu
tation of Lake Havasu City by
implying it is a crime ridden
communitv bossed by Mafia vet

erans," he said.
"The team has used the
technique of innuendo, hinting
guilt by association and the big
smear. We resent this and other
attacks by hit and run outsiders.
"At the same time it seems to
further prove our point that Lake
Havasu City is an outstanding
success. Critics would not give it
this much attention if it were a
failure."
Robert McCulloch Jr., presi
dent of McCulloch Properties,
said today that the stories of how
the company acquired the prop
erty for Lake Havasu City were
"a rehash of often told tales with
no resemblance to fact."
The main IRE in print report
said that Edward Eugene Fre
derico Jr., head of Lake Havasu's
Italian-American Anti-
Defamation League, "denies that
the influx of Rochester Italians
has any relationship to the
Mafia." According to the stories
in print, Frederico controls the
area's only asphalt and concrete
plants, "which have million
dollar subcontracts with the
Lake Havasu Irrigation and
Drainage District to build city
streets."
The stories said Lake Havasu
City also "apparently has hidden
the wide-ranging activities of
the 'Smokey' MetcaJf gang for
the past several years." Accord
ing to the published accounts,
the gang led by Walter Metcalf,
Walter Leßoy O'Leary and
Suzanne Marguerite Eads "al
legedly pulls holdups and
burglaries in California,
Arizona, Washington, New
Mexico, Oregon and Canada,
then returns to its 'safe house' in
Lake Havasu where the bandits
turn into model citizens."
The stories in print said that
other "Eastern transplants to

Lake Havasu City" include Wil
liam Hamill, former Rochester
deputy police commissioner.
Hamill, who retired from the
Rochester force several years
ago, was suspended from office
for 15 days in 1971 and lost $850
in pay at the recommendation of
a grand jury which investigated
a series of raids on bookie joints.
According to testimony before
the grand jury, Hamill allegedly
gave copies of betting slips to a

convicted gambler.
Published accounts of the
sidebar focused on the develop
ment of Lake Havasu City. The
stories said that in 1961 and
1962, Obed Lassen, then the
state land commissioner; former
Gov. Paul Fannin, the late
Democratic State Sen. Harold
Ciss and former Asst. Atty. Gen.
Charles Royall "all acting at
McCulloch's specific request,
sought and accomplished the

transfer of 13,000 acres of land
on the shores of Lake Havasu
from federal ownership to state
ownership."
The published accounts said
that the transfer was ac
complished under legislation
providing that revenues from the
sale of such land go into a trust
fund for the state's schools. "In
this case," the stories said, "the
state sold the 13,000 acres in one
chunk to McCulloch ... for less

than $1 million, even though
experts insisted at the time that
the state could have realized
about $6.5 million if the land
had been sold in small parcels."
The printed accounts said that
"to accomplish this coup,"
McCulloch hired Giss as a con
sultant to help overcome opposi
tion; rewarded Royall for legal
opinions favoring the project by
naming him manager of the new
city's governing board in 1964;

and persuaded "Lassen and
Fannin into believing that the
land was needed tor a tax
producing industrial plant
rather than lor a much more pro
fitable new-city development."
According to the stories,
McCulloch officials told the IRE
there had been no "hanky
panky" in the deal and said, "We
paid more for that land than
anyone else would have or could
have at the time."

ago, was suspended from office
for 15 days in 1971 and lost $850
in pay at the recommendation of
a grand jury which investigated
a series of raids on bookie joints.
According to testimony before
the grand jury, Hamill allegedly
gave copies of betting slips to a

convicted gambler.
Published accounts of the
sidebar focused on the develop
ment of Lake Havasu City. The
stories said that in 1961 and
1962, Obed Lassen, then the
state land commissioner; former
Gov. Paul Fannin, the late
Democratic State Sen. Harold
Ciss and former Asst. Atty. Gen.
Charles Royall "all acting at
McCulloch's specific request,
sought and accomplished the

transfer of 13,000 acres of land
on the shores of Lake Havasu
from federal ownership to state
ownership."
The published accounts said
that the transfer was ac
complished under legislation
providing that revenues from the
sale of such land go into a trust
fund for the state's schools. "In
this case," the stories said, "the
state sold the 13,000 acres in one
chunk to McCulloch ... for less

than $1 million, even though
experts insisted at the time that
the state could have realized
about $6.5 million if the land
had been sold in small parcels."
The printed accounts said that
"to accomplish this coup,"
McCulloch hired Giss as a con
sultant to help overcome opposi
tion; rewarded Royall for legal
opinions favoring the project by
naming him manager of the new
city's governing board in 1964;

and persuaded "Lassen and
Fannin into believing that the
land was needed tor a tax
producing industrial plant
rather than lor a much more pro
fitable new-city development."
According to the stories,
McCulloch officials told the IRE
there had been no "hanky
panky" in the deal and said, "We
paid more for that land than
anyone else would have or could
have at the time."
(AP) — Published accounts of
a series by a team of investigative
reporters say that Lake Havasu
City, Ariz., is becoming an "out
post for organized crime fi
gures," many of whom moved
west from Rochester, N.Y.
The stories said that Lake
Havasu City, a 14-year-old unin
corporated community, also is
"a safe haven for thugs and
thieves."
It has no police force and the
published accounts quoted in
vestigator Joe Chapin of the
sheriff's office as saying: "We
don't have the manpower and
the equipment to know what
these people are really up to. But
we know they are here. Some
times it seems like most of the
Rochester chapter of the Mafia
lives along the river."
The stories appeared in the
Wednesday editions of the In
dianapolis Star and the Al
buquerque Journal and some
other papers, available Tuesday
night. They were based on the
lHth installment of a 23-part
copyright series by Investigative
Reporters and Editors, Inc.,
which sponsored a team probe of
organized crime in Arizona.
Accounts of what was pre
sented as a sidebar to the main
installment said. "An IRE inves
tigation . . . shows that the city
. . . resulted from a massive land
grab that will earn McCulloch
Corp., the developer more than
$30 million" since 1963.
Rick Stephens, president of
Chamber of Commerce Lake
Havasu City, issued a statement
today criticizing the stories.
"The team of investigative re
porters and editors now have at
tempted to smear the good repu
tation of Lake Havasu City by
implying it is a crime ridden
communitv bossed by Mafia vet

erans," he said.
"The team has used the
technique of innuendo, hinting
guilt by association and the big
smear. We resent this and other
attacks by hit and run outsiders.
"At the same time it seems to
further prove our point that Lake
Havasu City is an outstanding
success. Critics would not give it
this much attention if it were a
failure."
Robert McCulloch Jr., presi
dent of McCulloch Properties,
said today that the stories of how
the company acquired the prop
erty for Lake Havasu City were
"a rehash of often told tales with
no resemblance to fact."
The main IRE in print report
said that Edward Eugene Fre
derico Jr., head of Lake Havasu's
Italian-American Anti-
Defamation League, "denies that
the influx of Rochester Italians
has any relationship to the
Mafia." According to the stories
in print, Frederico controls the
area's only asphalt and concrete
plants, "which have million
dollar subcontracts with the
Lake Havasu Irrigation and
Drainage District to build city
streets."
The stories said Lake Havasu
City also "apparently has hidden
the wide-ranging activities of
the 'Smokey' MetcaJf gang for
the past several years." Accord
ing to the published accounts,
the gang led by Walter Metcalf,
Walter Leßoy O'Leary and
Suzanne Marguerite Eads "al
legedly pulls holdups and
burglaries in California,
Arizona, Washington, New
Mexico, Oregon and Canada,
then returns to its 'safe house' in
Lake Havasu where the bandits
turn into model citizens."
The stories in print said that
other "Eastern transplants to

Lake Havasu City" include Wil
liam Hamill, former Rochester
deputy police commissioner.

"The team of investigative re
porters and editors now have at
tempted to smear the good repu
tation of Lake Havasu City by
implying it is a crime ridden
communitv bossed by Mafia vet

erans," he said.
"The team has used the
technique of innuendo, hinting
guilt by association and the big
smear. We resent this and other
attacks by hit and run outsiders.
"At the same time it seems to
further prove our point that Lake
Havasu City is an outstanding
success. Critics would not give it
this much attention if it were a
failure."
Robert McCulloch Jr., presi
dent of McCulloch Properties,
said today that the stories of how
the company acquired the prop
erty for Lake Havasu City were
"a rehash of often told tales with
no resemblance to fact."
The main IRE in print report
said that Edward Eugene Fre
derico Jr., head of Lake Havasu's
Italian-American Anti-
Defamation League, "denies that
the influx of Rochester Italians
has any relationship to the
Mafia." According to the stories
in print, Frederico controls the
area's only asphalt and concrete
plants, "which have million
dollar subcontracts with the
Lake Havasu Irrigation and
Drainage District to build city
streets."
The stories said Lake Havasu
City also "apparently has hidden
the wide-ranging activities of
the 'Smokey' MetcaJf gang for
the past several years." Accord
ing to the published accounts,
the gang led by Walter Metcalf,
Walter Leßoy O'Leary and
Suzanne Marguerite Eads "al
legedly pulls holdups and
burglaries in California,
Arizona, Washington, New
Mexico, Oregon and Canada,
then returns to its 'safe house' in
Lake Havasu where the bandits
turn into model citizens."
The stories in print said that
other "Eastern transplants to

Lake Havasu City" include Wil
liam Hamill, former Rochester
deputy police commissioner.
Hamill, who retired from the
Rochester force several years
ago, was suspended from office
for 15 days in 1971 and lost $850
in pay at the recommendation of
a grand jury which investigated
a series of raids on bookie joints.
According to testimony before
the grand jury, Hamill allegedly
gave copies of betting slips to a

convicted gambler.
Published accounts of the
sidebar focused on the develop
ment of Lake Havasu City. The
stories said that in 1961 and
1962, Obed Lassen, then the
state land commissioner; former
Gov. Paul Fannin, the late
Democratic State Sen. Harold
Ciss and former Asst. Atty. Gen.
Charles Royall "all acting at
McCulloch's specific request,
sought and accomplished the

transfer of 13,000 acres of land
on the shores of Lake Havasu
from federal ownership to state
ownership."
The published accounts said
that the transfer was ac
complished under legislation
providing that revenues from the
sale of such land go into a trust
fund for the state's schools. "In
this case," the stories said, "the
state sold the 13,000 acres in one
chunk to McCulloch ... for less

than $1 million, even though
experts insisted at the time that
the state could have realized
about $6.5 million if the land
had been sold in small parcels."
The printed accounts said that
"to accomplish this coup,"
McCulloch hired Giss as a con
sultant to help overcome opposi
tion; rewarded Royall for legal
opinions favoring the project by
naming him manager of the new
city's governing board in 1964;

and persuaded "Lassen and
Fannin into believing that the
land was needed tor a tax
producing industrial plant
rather than lor a much more pro
fitable new-city development."
According to the stories,
McCulloch officials told the IRE
there had been no "hanky
panky" in the deal and said, "We
paid more for that land than
anyone else would have or could
have at the time."
(AP) — Published accounts of
a series by a team of investigative
reporters say that Lake Havasu
City, Ariz., is becoming an "out
post for organized crime fi
gures," many of whom moved
west from Rochester, N.Y.
The stories said that Lake
Havasu City, a 14-year-old unin
corporated community, also is
"a safe haven for thugs and
thieves."
It has no police force and the
published accounts quoted in
vestigator Joe Chapin of the
sheriff's office as saying: "We
don't have the manpower and
the equipment to know what
these people are really up to. But
we know they are here. Some
times it seems like most of the
Rochester chapter of the Mafia
lives along the river."
The stories appeared in the
Wednesday editions of the In
dianapolis Star and the Al
buquerque Journal and some
other papers, available Tuesday
night. They were based on the
lHth installment of a 23-part
copyright series by Investigative
Reporters and Editors, Inc.,
which sponsored a team probe of
organized crime in Arizona.
Accounts of what was pre
sented as a sidebar to the main
installment said. "An IRE inves
tigation . . . shows that the city
. . . resulted from a massive land
grab that will earn McCulloch
Corp., the developer more than
$30 million" since 1963.
Rick Stephens, president of
Chamber of Commerce Lake
Havasu City, issued a statement
today criticizing the stories.
