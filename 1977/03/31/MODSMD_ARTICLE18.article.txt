R. Strauss Le Bourgeois Gen
til lio/n me
Schubert Symphony No. 7 "The
great C major"
Orchestras hate conductors —
or so popular opinion runs. A
conductor constantly battles his
orchestra in an atmosphere of
mutual antagonism and in these
days of fat union contracts and
symphonic strikes, the orches
tras are winning.
Klaus Tennstedt is a marvel
ous exception. Not only do or
chestras respond well to his ba
ton, but they seem to love him.
The Toronto Symphony recently
gave him an ovation as he
walked into rehearsal and last
week, the San Francisco Sym
phony heartily applauded his
performance (as did the audi
ence).
Since 1971, when Tennstedt
sneaked out of East Germany on
a forged passport, he has built a
tremendous reputation in the
West as a sensitive and popular
conductor. 1 have heard him sev
eral times—most recently last
week with the symphony—and 1
strongly endorse him.
Tennstedt will turn his unor
thodox conducting style (he
crouches on the podium as if he
will suddenly spring out into the
orchestra) to a Viennese prog
ram. The Strauss tone-poem Le
BourgeouisGentilhomme, based
on the Moliere play of the same
name, catches Strauss in a witty
and parodistic mood. After this
orchestral suite was written,
Strauss expanded the theme in
his opera Ariadne auf Naxos,
scheduled next year by the San
Francisco Opera.
Next to the "Unfinished Sym
phony," the "Great C Major" is
Schubert's most famous essay in
the form. Unfortunately,
Schubert was a poet, not an ar
chitect, and the Beethovenesque
proportions of this work occa
sionally get away from him,
leading to meandering repeti
tion. Only a conductor of great
sensitivity and expertise can il
luminate the masterful side of
this work. Tennstedt's attempt is
not to be missed — if he suc
ceeds, it could be a truly great
experience.
Saturday night's performance
is at the Flint Center, Cupertino.

Verdi Requiem
Verdi's operas are the staple of
major opera houses, San Fran
cisco is devoting one-fifth of
next season to his works and few
companies fail to pay their an
nual tribute to his genius. But
even without his operas, one
work would still earn him a spot
as one of the greatest composers
of all time: the Requiem Muss.
Written in memory of Ales
sandro Manzoni, the Italian au
thor whose epochal novel
triggered the Risorgimento, the
Requiem is a work of great force
— terrifyingly supernal and yet
tenderly human. This Mass for
four soloists, chorus and or
chestra is such a lyric and
dramatic presentation of the text
that it has been referred to as
"Verdi's opera in religious ves
tments." But the Requiem is no
joke, for it is a frightening testa
ment to Verdi's belief in omnipo
tent fate,
Katia Ricciarelli, Gwendolyn
Killebrew, Seth McCoy and Paul
Plishka will join Edo de Waart
with the symphony and chorus
in this monumental work. The
exposed brass parts and most
importantly, the profound
spiritiual insight needed to di
rect this piece will be an acid test
for the symphony and its new
conductor.
A must for the serious music

lover.

Tschaikowsky Piano Concerto
No. 1
Shostakovich Symphony No. 10
"Russia" and "youth" are the
key words to this set of concerts
as the 33-year old French pianist
Jean-Bernard Pommier and the
young Polish conductor
Kazimierz kord join the sym
phony in the music of
Tschaikowsky and Shos
takovich. While Kord is Poland's
best known conductor, Pommier
is well known in the USSR. His
friendship with Emil Gilels has
resulted in annual tours of the
Soviet Union for the past decade,
making him an interesting
choice to play Tschaikowsky.
Those who disparage music
without a message often point an
accusing finger at the
Tschaikowsky B Minor Piano
Concerto. To these critics, it
epitomizes popular but point
less music. Conversely, many
consider it an exciting and
beautiful concerto requiring
challenging virtuosity and filled
with a warm spirit. Both sides
point to its enormous popularity
(there are more recordings of
this than any other concerto) and
the "household" familiarity ot
the opening bars. Everyone must
make their own decision and a
live performance provides the

best oppnrtuntiy. i
Next to 'he Fifth, Shos
takovich's Tenth Symphony is
his most popular. The comple- i
tion of this rich and expansive
symphony i" 195:i marked the
end of an eight year pause, par
tially induced by rigid censor
ship, in which Shostakovich
wrote almost nothing. The dif
ficult woodwind parts will chal
lenge the Symphony's strongest
section.
Saturday night's performance
is at the Flint Center, Cupertino.

Bach Suite No. 2 for Flute and
Orchestra
Beethoven Symphony No. 8
Honegger Symphony No. 3
"Liturgique"
Kazimierz Kord returns to

conduct a concert featuring the
first flutist of the symphony.
Haul Renzi, who has been superb
all year, will be highlighted as a
soloist in the ever-popular Bach
Second Orchestral Suite.
Beethoven's Eighth Sym
phony is often seen as a lowly
and insignificant valley between
the monumental Seventh and
the Ninth. But, we must not
sneer at the Eighth, for it is a ma
ture and inventive work. While
continuing in the joyous spirit of
the Seventh and upholding the
tradition of the late Mozart sym
phonies, Beethoven has
fashioned a semi-precious clas
sical gem — unassuming, yet
powerful.
Artur Honnegger, the Swiss-
French composer who died in
1955, is remembered primarily

for a cantata, Joan of Arc at the
Stake, and Pacific 231 —a realis
tic portrait in sound of a steam
locomotive. This latter work,
which distresses senior citizens
and evokes critical disgust, has
obscured Honegger's worth
while contributions, such as this
Symphony No. 3.
Honegger blends the influ
ence of the French impre
ssionists with the German late
romanticism of Wagner and Max
Reger, His harmonies are tame
by 20th century standards and
although his music is often au
stere and cold, it occasionally
erupts into driving rhythms,
creating a Prokofiev-like effect.
The Symphony No. 3 is based on
several sections from the Latin
liturgy and exhibits Honegger at
his best. Do not miss a chance to

see this rarely performed work.

Rameau Overture to "Zuis"
Schonberg Verkiarte Nacht
Brahms Symphony No. 1
1 know nothing of how the
symphony management
chooses its soloists, but it is
quite clear that Christoph Hs
chenbach is a favorite. The
young German pianist played
the Beethoven Concerto No. 1
this year and has graced the ros
ter for years. This program will
give the audience an opportun
ity to hear him in his lesser
known role of conductor, facing
two of the most difficult works in
the standard repertoire.
Verkiarte Nacht (Transfigured
Night) was one of Arnold
Schonberg's first works, written
in 1899, long before he v.rote the
"twelve-tone" compositions
with which his name is as
sociated. Written in the style of
Richard Strauss, Verkiarte
Nacht is a tone-poem about a
couple meeting on a moonlit
night. Earlier this year, it was
seen in San Francisco as a ballet
entitled Pillar of Fire. Despite its
traditional harmonies, the Vie
nna premiere was greeted by
hisses, boos and fistfights in the
aisles, but it has become a favo
rite of audiences everywhere.
The product of 20 years labor,
Brahms's Symphony No. 1 is the
most impressive "first" sym
phony in music history. It is
powerful and heroic in the man
ner of Beethoven while its clas
sic form contains a seething
mass of lush harmonies, warm
orchestration and lovely
melodies. Its white hot C minor
intensity has made it one of the
most popular symphonies in the
repertoire.

Dusty Chaps
A cowboy band that mixes country western and jazz? Yep, but you'll have to go all the way to
Tucson, Arizona to hear them play. The Chaps have just released their second album, Honky Tonk
Music, on Capitol Records.
