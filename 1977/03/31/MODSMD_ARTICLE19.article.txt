## A
						Tucson band 
### 
For three years my friends in
Tucson have been telling me
about the Dusty Chaps, a local
band which seems to be enjoying
the rising popularity of country
rock music. The band's claim to
fame so far is a tour with the New
Riders of the Purple Sage and a
song called "Honky Tonk
Music" which was recorded by
Commander Cody.
The Chaps combine country
western, rock and jazz in a tight
mix of fiddle, guitar, pedal steel,
keyboards and saxophone. Their
style is somewhere between
Merle Haggard twang, '50s big
band and modern jazz.
Bassist George Hawke, who
has written over one hundred
songs for the band, and lead
singer Peter Gierlach founded
the Chaps eight years ago,
are the only remaining original
members.
The Chaps tour occasionally
and will be in Los Angeles later
this month. They have just re

leased a second album, Honky
Tonk Music, on Capitol Records.
But mostly the Chaps cater to
local fans who have followed
their Tucson odyssey from
PocoLoco's to P.J.'s, Rusty's, Ray
and Red's, theSilverbell Saloon,
the Alamo, the Stumble Inn, and
now, the Embers. The fans tend
to resist change, especially the
trend from country to jazz, and
they keep requesting old favo
rites like "Domino Joe" and
"Too Many Pretty Women to
Love Just One."
Yet, the middle-class
cowboy-hippy crowds who have
loyally pursued the Chaps from
year to year may learn to love the
new style. Country western and
jazz are a peculiar but workable
combination.
"A lot don't like to see us
change," says one member of the
Chaps. "I understand it. But the
loyal fans accept the change as it
comes."
