# Ames scientists discover five symmetrical rings around Uranus could be ice
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
Five thin rings have been discovered around
the planet Uranus, a research team from Ames
Research Center in Mountain View announced
yesterday. The scientists said it is the first major
discovery of a structure in the solar system since
the sighting of Pluto in 1930.
Previously, the only planet known to have rings
was Saturn. In an Associated Press (AP) inter
view, James Elliot, who made important observa
tions for Ames, said scientists are thus especially
interested in making comparisons between the
rings of Uranus and Saturn.
Saturn's rings are thousands of kilometers
wide, while those of Uranus range from six to 100
kilometers in width.
"We can't really tell" what Uranus' rings are
made of, Elliot also told AP "One good guess
would be some type of ice."
Complete surprise
The March 10 discovery came as a complete
surprise to the scientists working aboard an air
borne observatory over the Indian Ocean.
Elliot was attempting to obtain more precise
measurements of the diameter of Uranus and to
learn something about its atmospheric con
stituents, according to Robert (.ameron, chief of
the Airborne Science Office at Ames.
In the course of his observations, Elliot detected
five occultations (an object passing between the

observer and a star in the background), before the
planet itself occludes the observed stars .
He then witnessed the identical phenomenon
as the stars reappeared on the other side, suggest
ing the existence of five symmetrical rings.
Perth, Aastralia
When Elliot returned to Perth, Australia, where
the research team was based, he compared his
observations with those of Robert Millis of Lowell
Observatory in Arizona who had simultaneously
observed the planet from an observatory near
Perth.
Millis' observations and others made at New
Delhi, India, and Capetown, South Africa, con
firmed Elliot's discovery.
Elliot told AP the rings had not been discovered
before because light reflected from the planet
usually is so bright it obscures the lesser reflec
tions from the rings.
But on March 10, the planet's position on the
nightside of Earth provided the right light condi
tions for detecting the rings.
Elliot added it would probably be several years
before careful study of the rings will be possible at
which time they will be in a more favorable con
figuration for observation.
Not visual
Elliot's observations were not visual, but in
stead done with the help of a photometer which
gauges the intensity of light in a particular region.

Since the equipment Elliot used was already
up to measure the diameter of the planet, it was a
simple task to obtain the widths of the rings.
The time of occultation coupled with know
ledge of the relative speeds of Earth and Uranus
yield very accurate measurements of the diameter
of distant objects.
Stan Miller, public affairs officer at Ames, said
it is a big mystery how the rings got there, but
comparisons between Saturn's and Uranus' rings
may yield some clues. He also said the rings are
unusual because they are perpendicular to the
ecliptic.
That is, with respect to Earth, they appear to
wrap around the north and south poles of the
planet. Uranus, however, is "tilted" so that its
poles are where the equator is in relation to the
Earth. Thus, the rings actually wrap around the
planet's own equator.
Uranus is believed to be four times larger than
the Earth. It is the seventh planet from the sun and
has a surface temperature of 300 degrees below
zero, Fahrenheit.
Discovered it) 1781 by William Herschel, the
planet has a slight greenish appearance to obser
vers and completes one revolution around the sun
every 84 years.
Uranus has five satellites which have been
eliminated as possibilities for causing the occul
tations, according to Miller. j

it is a big mystery how the rings got there, but
comparisons between Saturn's and Uranus' rings
may yield some clues. He also said the rings are
unusual because they are perpendicular to the
ecliptic.
That is, with respect to Earth, they appear to
wrap around the north and south poles of the
planet. Uranus, however, is "tilted" so that its
poles are where the equator is in relation to the
Earth. Thus, the rings actually wrap around the
planet's own equator.
Uranus is believed to be four times larger than
the Earth. It is the seventh planet from the sun and
has a surface temperature of 300 degrees below
zero, Fahrenheit.
Discovered it) 1781 by William Herschel, the
planet has a slight greenish appearance to obser
vers and completes one revolution around the sun
every 84 years.
Uranus has five satellites which have been
eliminated as possibilities for causing the occul
tations, according to Miller. j
Five thin rings have been discovered around
the planet Uranus, a research team from Ames
Research Center in Mountain View announced
yesterday. The scientists said it is the first major
discovery of a structure in the solar system since
the sighting of Pluto in 1930.
Previously, the only planet known to have rings
was Saturn. In an Associated Press (AP) inter
view, James Elliot, who made important observa
tions for Ames, said scientists are thus especially
interested in making comparisons between the
rings of Uranus and Saturn.
Saturn's rings are thousands of kilometers
wide, while those of Uranus range from six to 100
kilometers in width.
"We can't really tell" what Uranus' rings are
made of, Elliot also told AP "One good guess
would be some type of ice."
Complete surprise
The March 10 discovery came as a complete
surprise to the scientists working aboard an air
borne observatory over the Indian Ocean.
Elliot was attempting to obtain more precise
measurements of the diameter of Uranus and to
learn something about its atmospheric con
stituents, according to Robert (.ameron, chief of
the Airborne Science Office at Ames.
In the course of his observations, Elliot detected
five occultations (an object passing between the

observer and a star in the background), before the
planet itself occludes the observed stars .
He then witnessed the identical phenomenon
as the stars reappeared on the other side, suggest
ing the existence of five symmetrical rings.
Perth, Aastralia
When Elliot returned to Perth, Australia, where
the research team was based, he compared his
observations with those of Robert Millis of Lowell
Observatory in Arizona who had simultaneously
observed the planet from an observatory near
Perth.
Millis' observations and others made at New
Delhi, India, and Capetown, South Africa, con
firmed Elliot's discovery.
Elliot told AP the rings had not been discovered
before because light reflected from the planet
usually is so bright it obscures the lesser reflec
tions from the rings.
But on March 10, the planet's position on the
nightside of Earth provided the right light condi
tions for detecting the rings.
Elliot added it would probably be several years
before careful study of the rings will be possible at
which time they will be in a more favorable con
figuration for observation.
Not visual
Elliot's observations were not visual, but in
stead done with the help of a photometer which
gauges the intensity of light in a particular region.

Since the equipment Elliot used was already
up to measure the diameter of the planet, it was a
simple task to obtain the widths of the rings.
The time of occultation coupled with know
ledge of the relative speeds of Earth and Uranus
yield very accurate measurements of the diameter
of distant objects.
Stan Miller, public affairs officer at Ames, said
it is a big mystery how the rings got there, but
comparisons between Saturn's and Uranus' rings
may yield some clues. He also said the rings are
unusual because they are perpendicular to the
ecliptic.
