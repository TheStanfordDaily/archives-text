Black Sunday
Paramount rslease, produced by Robert
Evans, execut've producer Robert Rown Di
rected by John Frankeohetmer Written by
Kenneth Roaa, Ivan Moffatt and Ernest
Lehman. Photographed by John AJonso. Star
ring Robert Shaw, Bruce Demand Marthe Kel
ler. MPAA rating: R.
Michael Lander, one of the
three main characters in John
Frankenheimer's film Black
Sunday, is a very determined
man. His imprisonment in a
North Vietnam prison camp for
seven years and subsequent
court-martial have left him with
only one ambition. Revenge.
Lander does not think
small. His ambition is as big as
the Goodyear blimp he pilots for
CBS sports events. Wanting to
leave the United States —his
tormentor — something to re
member him by, he approaches
the Arab extremist group Black
September with a plan to deto
nate a bomb capable of massacr
ing every single occupant of the
Super Bowl stadium on New
Years Day, including the presi
dent of the United States.
An Israeli agent, Kabokov
(Robert Shaw), stumbles upon
the plan during a commando
raid, and the race is on to see if he
can abort the plan of Lander and
his Black September cohort,
Dahlia (Marthe Keller).
Roller coaster of terror
Black Sunday is as ruthless as
its characters. It stops at nothing,
knows no bounds, in dragging
its audience on a roller coaster of
terror. Its characters use
blackmail, murder, kidnapping
and explosives on their oppo
nents. The movie employs a har
rowing series of chases,
climaxes, and ironies to grip the
audience. It's so absorbing that

you could be dying of starvation
and it would never occur to you
that there was a candy counter
50 feet behi nd you. It's so terrify
ing that you start looking at
people on the street, wondering
which side they're on.
Never mind that fear of indis
criminate death is a component
of disaster movies — Black Sun
day has infinitely more depth
and intelligence than any disas
ter movie, not to mention most
thrillers.
Ground kitty
Screenwriters Ernest Lehman,
Kenneth Ross, and Ivan Moffat
condensed Thomas Harris'
novel of the same name admira
bly, mercifully excising the
scene where Lander drops his
wife's kitten down the garbage
disposal. Nevertheless, the
film's violence is far from
sanitized. The weaponry of
choice is a toss-up between
machine guns and plastic explo
sives disguised in Virgin Mary
statuettes.
Shaw has never been
better. Rarely portraying the
hero, Shaw makes Kabokov a
sensitive man facing enemies
and a world suffused with a
madness he understands too
well. Bruce Dern returns to his
days as a psychotic staple of the
movies, since Lander has long
since gone off the deep end as a
result of his confinement. And
Marthe Keller (Dustin Hoffman's
nemesis in Marathon Man) once
again plays the cunning, enig
matic villainess. Hopefully her
next film, Bobby Deerfield, will
break her American film mold
with something a little more
normal than the angry-bitch-of
all-trades.

Airport 77
Untversd reJesas. produced by Wllam Frye,
executive producer Jennings Lang. Directed
by Jerry Jameson Written by Mtctisel Scheft

The trick to enjoying movies
lies in gauging your mood and
finding the film that will best
match your mood. This can be
difficult. Sometimes the particu
lar movie you desire is not play
ing. Sometimes, if you're really
ina mental asteroid belt, ithasn't
been made yet.
If you are in a pensive mood,
that is the time to see Nicholas
and Alexandra or The Man Who
Fell To Earth. If you are feeling
hyperactive, that is the time to
see The Towering Inferno. It is
not the time to see Barry Lyndon.
Airport '77 is the film to see
during post-finals withdrawal
(oh oh, too late), whenyourbrain
is on hold. You don't have to
think, establish motivation for
the action, or even pay attention
— without missing a thing,
But — one must credit the plot
with a little imagination.
Whenever the topic of new dis
aster movies comes up, one al
ways imagines a combination of
errant planes and burning build
ings. But who would have
thought of errant planes and
sinking ships. Tell me — did
having a hijacked, privately
owned Boeing 747 collide with
an oil derrick in the Bermuda
Triangle and sink in 300 feet of
water ever occur to you? Be hon
est now.
Of course, this allowed
screenwriters Michael Scheff

and David Spector and director
Jerry Jameson to incorporate
every phobia known to man.
Where else were claustrophobia,
fear of flying, and fear of drown
ing ever combined so smoothly?
Not only does it have all the
stock fears, but it also has all the
stock situations. The daughter
and grandson of the owner are
on the plane. The captain (Jack
Lemmon) and the stewardess
(Brenda Vaccaro) have been liv
ing together and are considering
marriage. One of the passengers
is in love with the pianist on
board. Two elderly people
(Joseph Cotton and Olivia de-
Havilland) meet after a 40-year
hiatus and rekindle their love for
one another.
One of the saving graces of
Airport '77 is that few of its par
ticipants take ihe script seri
ously. Lee Grant, playing the al
coholic wife of Christopher I.ee,
turns in a funnier performance
than she did in Shampoo.
Meanwhile, Darren McGavin
plays his part as an engineer
with enough savoir faire to look
like he's enjoying himself, rather
than suffering through the
proceedings. Only George Ken
nedy and Jimmy Stewart play
the game straight and come off
looking as if they stepped into
the wrong studio.
The film, unlike its predeces
sor, Airport 1975, isn't totally
worthless. Besides giving critics
the opportunity to write hilari
ous reviews, it has also advanced
film technology.
(Airport '77 is currently playing
at the Old Mill Six in Palo Alto.)

Going down
Robert Shaw lowers himself from a helicopter onto the Goodyear blimp to prevent a spectacular
holocaust in John Frankenheimer's film Black Sunday. Shaw's nemeses in the thriller are Bruce
Dern and Martha Keller.
