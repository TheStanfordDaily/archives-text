## Going to the City 
### 
"It's a place where everyone
comes to get wild and have a
good time!" It's hard to believe
that this is the description of a
place that began as a Wells Fargo
bank records depository. Yet,
sure enough, these words refer to
The City, San Francisco's largest
entertainment complex, located
at 936 Montgomery Street.
Converted from a bank records
depository to a pool hall, to an
exclusively male cabaret, and,
finally, to a supperclub/
discotheque. The City's physical
layout is impressive. Its
downstairs showroom features
sitdown entertainment, along
with mixed drinks and a choice
of a few entrees.
1 Ipstairs, The City's most out
standing feature is its thirteen
foot-high jukebox, which in
cludes selector buttons, two
turntables, and one of the disco's
five speakers.
Equally extraordinary is the
computerized, multi-colored
lighting system, able to project a
variety of patterns, words, mo
tions, and intensities to corres
pond to the beat of the music.
These two innovations, in addi
tion to four rotating mirror balls,
60 dicrolitic colored spotlights,
mirror paneling, black lights,
and strobe lights make the up
stairs discotheque a technical

gem.
With this astounding audio
visual splendour, and with the
quality of its entertainers. The
City consistently attracts a large,
diversified crowd. Its clientele,
originally predominantly gay, is
now approximately half
heterosexual. This gradual in
flux of straights is causing quite
a controversy among the pat
rons.
Gay customers seem to be
especially perturbed. One ob
served that, "On the weekends,
its HO per cent heterosexual. It's
just like any other bar now."
Of those questioned, women
seem to be the least concerned
about the increasing number of
straights. One woman, enjoying
an evening with her girlfrield,
claimed that, "This is the only
place to go in San Francisco
where you can dance and not get
hassled."
Another, non-gay, client gave
this appraisal of the situation:
"Gay bars start out with a high
energy level. The problem is
that, once people catch on that a
place is good for dancing and
such, the straights come and
deaden it out, and the gays leave.
This place is definitely the best
place to go to have fun. All the
other discos are just too straight
and too sex-oriented."
