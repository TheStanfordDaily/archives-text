## 'Beauty' lacked stagecraft 
### 
The last and greatest of the
court ballets, The Sleeping
Beauty premiered in 1890 in the
Maryinsky Theater of St.
Petersburg. The original settings
were intended to contrast with
the high baroque of Louis
XlV(the princess having slept for
one hundred years), purposely
implying comparison of the
Romanov Court to the Sun-
King's court.
Beauty reflected the taste of a
complacent aristocracy for ex
travagance but Marius Petipa's
choreography and Tchaikows
ky's music transcend its estab
lished limitations to create a
great work of art. It is considered
the test of classical training for
any company; one looks for
corps uniformity as well as the
technical and artistic merit of the
many divertissements.
American Ballet Theater
Company roused The Sleeping
Beauty last year and ended its
two-week Bay Area season with
three performances of Beauty on
March 12th and 13th.
Court protocol
The ABT production came off
very well, but the American
trained dancers, though techni
cally strong, lacked the type of
stage presence required by the
ballet. Basic court protocol, such
as not turning one's back to the
king and queen, is not taught to
our dancers. There was an ill
at-ease, definitely non-noble,
feeling among the corps when
they weren't actually dancing.
The only dancer who walked re
gally and musically in the pro
logue is Kristine Elliott. If the
problem was a lack of identifica
tion then it's because The Sleep
ing Beauty is meant to be per
formed by dancers who have
been trained in the same school
with pampered dignity in their
vocation. ABT's dancers come
from many schools of thought
regarding the teaching of ballet;
it's easy to tell the classicists
apart from the neo-classicists.
Martine Van Hamel, Natalia
Makarova, and Cynthia Gregory
each divined a different person

ality in Princess Aurora. Van
Hamel was a lovely, unspoiled
child; her direct audience con
tact and wholesome amplitude
of movement are especially ap
pealing in the Rose Adagio on
theday ofhissixteenthbirthday.
Makarova, more than any
other dancer, shows us how
good ballet feels: her sensuous,
liquid neck and shoulders and
her silky rubato phrasing com
pel us to believe that she really is
only a vision in act 2, the
dream sequence. And in that act,
her introspective portrayal made
me weep.
Sensitivity and freshness
But Cynthia Gregory synth
esized both sensitivity and
freshness and did not over
power. Even during the techni
cally difficult Rose Adagio,
when she balanced with her leg
in second position as she rolled
down through her foot, she was
proud of herself as a young
woman and not as a ballerina.
Subsidiary soloists are as often
identified with and areas impor
tant to Beauty as the ballerinas.
Though he had injured his back,
Ivan Nagy impressed me with
his princely gallantry even when
he did nothing more than stand
still. Charles Ward has a com
mand that makes Clark Tippet
fade; but, also, Tippet's soggy
half-toe position does not give
him enough of an illusion of con
trol.
During the prologue, seven
fairies (six plus the Lilac), each
present their gifts to the new
born princess. lolinda Menen
dez' distant, foreign regality em
bodied the forces of good which
the lilac fairy represents. Re
becca Wright, the fairy of the
songbirds, shimmered ecstati
cally and kristine Elliott and
karena Brock danced with unaf
fected brio.
Fairy tale characters
Characters from Perrault's
fairy tales come along to the
wedding feast in the last act. En
rico Cecchetti, the great teacher,
originally danced the blue bird
variation. George de la Pena

spoiled his bluebird solo with
poor carriage of his upper body.
Terry Orr's Florestan was weak,
but if he hadn't looked so
apologetic the audience
wouldn't have ca r ed. Marianna
Tcherkassky and kristine Elliott
danced the Enchanted Princess
variation; they varied in temper
ament but excelled in scintillat
ing beat technique.
Despite this Sleeping Beauty's
inevitable handicaps — lack of
uniform training, insubstantial
coaching in stagecraft, and com
parative technical weaknesses
among the males, the dancers
gave a performance intimate in
effect within a spacious frame.
Any criticism of their perfor
mance is really one of America's
ability and willingness to
thoroughly train its classical
dancers.
