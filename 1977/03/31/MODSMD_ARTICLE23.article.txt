# Film on S. Africa

### 
Last Grave at Dimbaza, a de
vastating indictment of apar
theid, was made illegally in
South Africa and smuggled out
of the country. It was shot by
whites in the cities and by blacks
in the bantustans, the reserves
where blacks are forced to live.
African women are shown
nuturing and caring for white
children while they must send
their own babies to live or starve
in the bantustans. Black men
who work all day for a pittance
are segregated at night in squalid
barracks apart from their
families whom they may visit
once a year. Every black must
carry an internal pass manufac
tured with the help of Polaroid
and IBM. Six million have been

jailed for not producing these
passes on demand. There is one
doctor for every 600 whites but
only one for each 60,000 blacks.
The movie graphically por
trays the racism and exploitation
which support a standard of liv
ing for the white minority that is
the highest in the world. The
conclusion that not only the: fas
cist nationalist regime but also
the 300 American corporations
with operations in South Africa
have a stake in apartheid,
emerges clearly from the film.
The film will be shown in
Cubberley Auditorium on
Thursday, March 31, at 7:3(J p.m.
as part of the Pendleton 14 De
fense Committee forum on ra
cism.
