# $750 awaits student winner
## Alumni to fund service project 
### Sue Lesjak 
Do you have a terrific project waiting for a sponsor? If so,
the Alumni Association has something for you â€” the Pierce
Memorial Award. The association will award $750 to help
fund a student-originated, student service program.
"If you'd like to start a women's rugby team or a student
run summer job program, or install solar heating panels in
your dorm, maybe this is for you," said Irma Nogales, head
of the association's student services.
The award is in honor of former association director
Robert Pierce.
The association attaches no restrictions on the type of
project eligible for funding, "as long as it benefits the Stan
ford community," said Nogales.
Last year was the first time the award was offered. The
recipient, chosen from nineapplicants, was Dave Brown, an
applied earth sciences graduate student who set up the
Student Consumer Service Center here.
His center, on the second floor of the Old Firehouse, is
available to all students here.
He said his service handles landlord-tenant relations,
defective merchandise, and warranty problems, automobile
sales and service practices, credit problems and unfair bus
iness practices in general.
Brown said he is quite pleased with the Student Con
sumer Service Center. "We have had a lot of consumer
complaints," he reported, but added that not as many stu

dents use the service as he would like.
The service is currently investigating a student com
plaint against the Transition, charging the restaurant with
reducing the size of its pizzas without either informing
customers or changing the size of pizza plates on display.
John Martin, head of the Transition, said he has not been
contacted about the complaint. He also said he thinks the
charge is "unwarranted."
Brown said there were about five regular volunteers
working for the consumer service last quarter and there will
be more this quarter, allowing the center to expand its
activities.
Recipients of the Pierce Award must make two reports to
an Alumni Board of Executives. Brown said the board has
not restricted his activities at all. "I've been pretty free," he
commented.
Brown reported he still has about half of the Pierce
Memorial award money left over, and said he hopes to
continue his service center next year and indefinitely if
student interest persists. He said he uses the money for
supplies and phone costs.
This year's proposals for the Pierce Memorial Award
don't need to be anything like Brown's service, however,
Nogales stressed. The student program needn't even be an
on-going service but can be a one-day affair like a drama
production or a concert benefiting a large number of stu
dents, she said.
