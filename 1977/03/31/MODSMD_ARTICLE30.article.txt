Assassination probe to continue
Washington — A divided House voted yes
terday to give its beleaguered assassinations
committee two more years to probe the mur
ders of President John Kennedy and civil rights
leader Dr. Martin Luther King.
The final vote on continuing the existence of
the committee was 230 to 181. The body has
sparked controversy since the first day of the
current legislative session. Without the ap
proval, the committee would have died at
midnight today.
Committee chairman Louis Stokes (D-Ohio),
said after the vote he believed the approval
came only because the committee's controver
sial chief counsel, Richard Sprague, resigned
earlier in the day in an effort to save the inves
tigation.
The vote to extend the committee's life came
after a sharp debate in which opponents
claimed the committee had nothing but hear
say evidence. Supporters of the panel argued
that terminating the committee at this point
would convince the American public that a
cover-up was going on.
"It would be a tragedy if this committee were
not reconstituted because the American people
would not be able to have these questions
about the assassinations answered," said
Stokes during the debate.
Meanwhile in Palm Springs, Fla., authorities
ruled that George de Mohrenschildt, a former
friend of Lee Harvey Oswald, apparently killed
himself within hours after an investigator for
the House Committee attempted to interview
him.
The Palm Beach County medical examiner
said an autopsy of the 65-year-old
Mohrenschildt showed the fatal wound was
"conducive to that of a self-inflicted gunshot,"
sheriff's Lt. Richard Sheets said.
Stokes later told reporters that
Mohrenschildt "was one of the crucial witnes
ses." He declined to elaborate.
The committee was established late last
year and has been embroiled in controversy
from the first day this Congress opened in

January.
Jumbo jet crash tapes released
Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Canary Islands —
Spanish officials agreed yesterday to release
tapes of the last exchanges among two Boeing
747 pilots and the airport tower here, giving
investigators a record of events leading up to
aviation's worst disaster.
Authorities said the tapes would be flown to
Washington at the request of Dutch and
American officials for an analysis in the pre
sence of KLM and Pan American crew mem
bers who could identify the voices.
Investigators said the last nine minutes ot
conversation recorded in the cockpits ot the
Pan Am and KLM Royal Dutch A irways Boeing
747s held the key to why the Dutch pilot began
his fatal take off run directly into the American
jet. Investigators said the KLM jet had not been
given clearance to take off.
Both flight recorders were recovered and
impounded by the Spanish, who are in charge
of the investigation.
American and Dutch investigators inter
viewed two Spanish air controllers on duty in
the tower when the collision occurred Sunday.
One investigator said afterward that tower
personnel followed proper procedure and their
instructions were in correct English.
The death toll in the crash rose to 577 as two
of the 71 persons who survived the crash and
fire Sunday died overnight. All 71 escaped
from the Pan Am jet, and the dead included 323
Americans.
Some of the least seriously injured survivors
of the jumbo jet collision off West Africa ar
rived in Southern California yesterday and
were taken home or to hospitals near their
homes.
Bill for legal Laetrile clears hurdle
Sacramento — A measure legalizing the use
of Laetrile for cancer in California was ap
proved by a Senate committee yesterday, de
spite a claim it would be "licensed voodoo."
The 7-0 vote of the Senate Health and Wei

fare Committee sent the bill by Sen. William
Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), to the Senate
floor.
The measure would a!low use of Laetrile —
now available in Mexico and other regions —
only by prescription and under direction of a
licensed physician.
"We don't want indiscriminate use of this
substance by anyone," Campbell said.
Foes argued strenuously that use of Laetrile,
a substance produced from apricot pits, raises
false hopes among cancer victims and diverts
patients from proven forms of treatment.
Higher prices key to energy plan
Washington — The Carter administration is
considering regulations and taxes to drive up
the prices of oil and natural gas and drive down
their use, a government source said yesterday.
Rough calculations based on proposals
under consideration indicate they might add
another six cents per gallon to the cost of
gasoline and other petroleum fuels, and
another $16 per year to the average household
gas bill.
Electricity rates might also be increased, de
pending on the cost and popularity of switch
ing powerplants from gas or oil to coal as their
primary fuel, and on the tendency of coal
prices to increase along with the other fuels.
An administration source said yesterday that
the president's energy policy team was work
ing on a number of ideas "in the embryonic
stage," which have not yet been submitted to
Carter himself. These include:
—Continuing federal regulation of the price
of natural gas sold by producers to interstate
pipelines, instead of removing it as has been
widely proposed. The regulated price ceiling
would be raised.
—Raising natural gas and oil prices, through
a federal tax excise on gas sold to electric
power plants or other industries using the
scarce fuel to heat boilers. This is designed to
make them shift to coal.
These proposals marked a new alternative to
the much-debated options of ending oil and

gas price controls or imposing mandatory re
strictions on fuel use by consumers.
T he source said the new ideas still need con
siderable refinement by Carter's energy team
before a decision can be made whether to
propose them to the president for his April 20
energy message to Congress.
Andrus wants redwood cut halted
Sacramento — The Carter administration
reacted angrily yesterday to timber companies'
refusal to impose a moratorium on logging
near Redwood National Park, the Sacramento
Bee reported.
The White House promised to "expedite"
work on proposed legislation to expand the
park in the Redwood Creek Basin in Humboldt
County, the newspaper said. Several con
gressmen, meanwhile, suggested imposing a
logging moratorium.
Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus, who had re
quested the 180-day moratorium, indicated he
was considering filing suit.
"We are looking into all possible actions
with regard to the firms' response, including
the possibility of legal action," Andrus said in
a statement.
The presidents of Areata National Corp.,
Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Simpson Timber
Co. wrote a joint letter to President Jimmy Car
ter Tuesday calling the moratorium request
"an unreasonable and unjustifiable action"
rooted in "the ignorance of the federal gov
ernment."
They said logging near the park did not
damage or endanger the towering redwoods in
the park.
NBA referees threaten strike
Philadelphia — National Basketball Associ
ation (NBA) referees will strike the playoff
games starting next month if the league refuses
to bargain in good faith for a new contract, a
lawyer for the referees said last night.
Richie Phillips, attorney for the 24-member
National Association of Basketball Referees
(NABR), told a news conference that the NABR

already had filed unfair labor practices against
the NBA with the National Labor Relations
Board.
He said the referees' association had told the
board that the NBA has refused to bargain and
has withdrawn recognition of the association
as collective bargaining agent for the referees.
The referees' contract expires April 10, the
last day of the NBA regular season.
In addition to increased pay for both the reg
ular season and playoff games, the referees are
seeking severance pay, increased insurance, an
arbitration clause on dismissals and a cost-of
living clause, Phillips said.
Today's weather
Fair and continued cool this afternoon
through tomorrow. Lows tonight mid 30s to
mid 40s. Highs mid 50s to mid 60s.
