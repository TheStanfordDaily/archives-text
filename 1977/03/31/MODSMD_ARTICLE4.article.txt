# Arms control proposal rejected by Brezhnev

Moscow (AP) — Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev rejected American
nuclear arms control proposals yester
day, shattering the latest effort to sign a
new strategic arms limitation treaty.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who
iiad waited three days for a response to
his proposals at the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT), said both a
comprehensive and a more limited
approach had been offered but the
Soviets "did not find either one ac
ceptable."
In Washington, President Jimmy
Carter said he will be forced to con
sider a speedup of U.S. weapons de
velopment if the Soviet Union does not
negotiate "in good faith" at another
round of arms talks in May.
Following the breakdown of negoti
ations in Moscow, the president said
he intended "to remain very strong" in
seeking a comprehensive agreement
that makes substantial cuts in the two
superpowers' arsenals.
"I'm not in any hurry," Carter said in
response to a question. "It's important
enough to proceed methodically."
New session
However, the president said in re
ference to a newly scheduled bargain

ing session in May between Vance and
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko:
"If we feel at the conclusion of next
month's discussions that the Soviets
are not acting in good faith with us,
and that an agreement is unlikely, then
1 would be forced to consider a much
more deep commitment to the de
velopment and deployment of addi
tional weapons.
"But 1 would like to forego that deci
sion until I am convinced the Soviets
are not acting in good faith. I hope they
will." he said.
Carter said he has not yet heard from
Vance "the specific reasons" for the
Soviet rejection of American propos
als.
'Radical departure'
However, he said, his guess was that
the U.S. proposal for a comprehensive
pact was "such a radical departure"
from past negotiations that the Soviets
simply need"more time to consider it.
Vance denied the proposals had
been turned down because of Soviet
unhappiness over American human
rights criticism. He said the Russians
rejected both proposals because "they
did not coincide with what they con
sider to be an equitable deal."
The Carter administration has stres
sed its commitment to human rights
around the world, and Brezhnev has
warned publicly that U.S. criticism of
internal Soviet affairs could interfere
with arms talks and other efforts to im
prove relations between the two coun
tries.
Vance said he had been unable to
reach even his minimum goal of set
ting up a format for continuing SALT
talks.
Only Brezhnev
He said he would bring the arms
control matter up again in May at a
meeting with Gromyko, probably in
Western Europe.
But Brezhnev is the only single
leader who would normally be able to
accept American SALT proposals and
Vance noted the Middle East "and
other items" would also be on the May
agenda.
He told reporters he had met with
Brezhnev for one hour, with the Soviet
leader "doing all the talking" and
proposing "nothing new on their

side."
Vance had said he would stay in
Moscow longer if progress on the tre
aty proposals warranted it, but plan
ned after the Brezhnev meeting to
leave for Western Europe this morn
ing, on schedule.
Relations impossible
Brezhnev told Vance in a Monday
meeting that American criticism of
Soviet handling of human rights mat
ters made good relations impossible
between the Soviet Union and the Un
ited States.
Vance said the human rights issue
had "not come up" yesterday and the
SALT proposals "stood on their own
feet."
Other American officials, however,
speculated that the SALT rejection
was related to the earlier warning.
An interim nuclear arms control ac
cord expires Oct. 3, but Vance said "it
is still possible" to reach a SALT ag
reement before then.

However, the president said in re
ference to a newly scheduled bargain

ing session in May between Vance and
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko:
"If we feel at the conclusion of next
month's discussions that the Soviets
are not acting in good faith with us,
and that an agreement is unlikely, then
1 would be forced to consider a much
more deep commitment to the de
velopment and deployment of addi
tional weapons.
"But 1 would like to forego that deci
sion until I am convinced the Soviets
are not acting in good faith. I hope they
will." he said.
Carter said he has not yet heard from
Vance "the specific reasons" for the
Soviet rejection of American propos
als.
'Radical departure'
However, he said, his guess was that
the U.S. proposal for a comprehensive
pact was "such a radical departure"
from past negotiations that the Soviets
simply need"more time to consider it.
Vance denied the proposals had
been turned down because of Soviet
unhappiness over American human
rights criticism. He said the Russians
rejected both proposals because "they
did not coincide with what they con
sider to be an equitable deal."
The Carter administration has stres
sed its commitment to human rights
around the world, and Brezhnev has
warned publicly that U.S. criticism of
internal Soviet affairs could interfere
with arms talks and other efforts to im
prove relations between the two coun
tries.
Vance said he had been unable to
reach even his minimum goal of set
ting up a format for continuing SALT
talks.
Only Brezhnev
He said he would bring the arms
control matter up again in May at a
meeting with Gromyko, probably in
Western Europe.
But Brezhnev is the only single
leader who would normally be able to
accept American SALT proposals and
Vance noted the Middle East "and
other items" would also be on the May
agenda.
He told reporters he had met with
Brezhnev for one hour, with the Soviet
leader "doing all the talking" and
proposing "nothing new on their

side."
Vance had said he would stay in
Moscow longer if progress on the tre
aty proposals warranted it, but plan
ned after the Brezhnev meeting to
leave for Western Europe this morn
ing, on schedule.
Relations impossible
Brezhnev told Vance in a Monday
meeting that American criticism of
Soviet handling of human rights mat
ters made good relations impossible
between the Soviet Union and the Un
ited States.
Vance said the human rights issue
had "not come up" yesterday and the
SALT proposals "stood on their own
feet."
Other American officials, however,
speculated that the SALT rejection
was related to the earlier warning.
An interim nuclear arms control ac
cord expires Oct. 3, but Vance said "it
is still possible" to reach a SALT ag
reement before then.
Moscow (AP) — Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev rejected American
nuclear arms control proposals yester
day, shattering the latest effort to sign a
new strategic arms limitation treaty.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who
iiad waited three days for a response to
his proposals at the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT), said both a
comprehensive and a more limited
approach had been offered but the
Soviets "did not find either one ac
ceptable."
In Washington, President Jimmy
Carter said he will be forced to con
sider a speedup of U.S. weapons de
velopment if the Soviet Union does not
negotiate "in good faith" at another
round of arms talks in May.
Following the breakdown of negoti
ations in Moscow, the president said
he intended "to remain very strong" in
seeking a comprehensive agreement
that makes substantial cuts in the two
superpowers' arsenals.
"I'm not in any hurry," Carter said in
response to a question. "It's important
enough to proceed methodically."
