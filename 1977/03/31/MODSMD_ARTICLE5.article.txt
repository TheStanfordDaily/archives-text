# Contract violated, says USE

### Bill Burger 
The transfer of Shirley Bawcum. a
United Stanford Employees (USE)
member, from the Branner Hall
kitchen to Wilbur Hall violates parts of
the 1976 agreement between USE and
the University, according to a USE
charge scheduled to be issued today.
Edward Scoles, director of Univer
sity housing, said however, that the
charge "shows how little the union
knows about their own contract."
USE's charge states Bawcum was
"forcibly transferred from Branner to
Wilbur with no notice, no steward,
changing her days and hours and job
for no reason at 10:13 a.m. Wednes
day."
This action resulted from Bawcum's
support of fired Branner cook Lindsey
Taylor, and was thus disciplinary,
former USE President Jim Berk main
tained.
Scoles said Bawcum was transferred
because there was a temporary vac
ancy at Wilbur and the move might not
be permanent. He added he thought
the switch was in Bawcum's "best in
terests," considering the cir
cumstances of the case.
Maxine Anderson, manager of the
University food service, said the move
would "be good" for Bawcum. Ander
son said the transfer was not a discip
linary one as USE charged.
The USE charge asks personnel to
"restore her (Bawcum's) job, days and
hours, and apologize to her for this
treatment." It further states that
Scoles, Anderson and Branner food
service manager Janice Marks should
be reprimanded.
Marks said she felt the decision to
transfer Bawcum was "advantageous
to both the food service and to Shir
ley." Marks contended the action
taken was in no way punitive.
In response to the USE charge,
Marks said management "is aware of
the contract and tries to live within the
agreement." Bawcum "would not
have been transferred," said Marks,
"if it was in violation of the contract."
Marks said management can transfer
workers if the need arises as she said it
did in Bawcum's case.
Bawcum could not be reached for
comment.
