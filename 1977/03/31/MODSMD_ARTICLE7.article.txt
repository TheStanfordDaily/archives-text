## Opinions Pendleton racism exists here 
### 
Drew Wechsler

On Nov. 13, 1976, 14 black Marines
gained entrance to what they took to be
a meeting of the Ku Klux klan in the
barracks of Camp Pendleton, Califor
nia. A 20-second fight resulted in in
juries. Charges including conspiracy
to commit murder have been placed
against the 14, and if convicted, they
may spend a good part of their lives in
the brig.
The Marine Corps first denied the
existence of the KKK on the base and
portrayed the 14 as having randomly
attacked whites. But an originally
suppressed Naval Investigative Ser
vice report reveals that directly after
the fight, a group of admitted KKKers
in the adjoining room emerged into the
hallway armed with knives and clubs.
All the barracks doors on that floor
were covered with Klan "White Man
— Wake Up" stickers. The KKK mem
bers had been active at Pendleton for
over a year prior to the incident, and
their organizing had become bolder as

their numbers grew, without any hin
drance from the Marines.
Klan's influence
The Marine Corps is known for its
tight control of very detail of its mem
bers' lives. Why was the Klan toler
ated? The base commandant said, "If
this group exists, it has done nothing
to injure the interests of the military.
So we have taken no action."
But KKK Marines have openly
sported the Klan uniform of cowboy
boots and hat with KKK card attached
while on duty. Just prior to Nov. 13, a
black returning to base was jumped by
a gang of whites; a Klanner dropped
his knife in the mess hall and was
loudly told to pick up his "nigger
sticker." Just after the incident, a black
was found handcuffed to the shower
with a plastic bag over his head and
razor and knife slashes over his body.
The corps called this, "attempted
suicide." No charges have ever been
filed against any whites.
The only action has been to add to
the Klan's racist terror by prosecuting
14 brave black Marines who finally
had enough and decided to fight the
Klan.
The corps has stacked the deck
against them: military defense lawyers
who were six months out of training,
an experienced prosecution, separate
trials, and solitary confinement (ended
by an appeal of defense committee
lawyer David Weitzman). But the de
fendants are continuing the struggle
by conducting a political defense, put
ting the Marines' racism on trial in
stead.
Long list of crimes
The phenomenon is not isolated.
Klan incidents have been reported
from all the armed services. The KKK
has a sordid history intimately con
nected to the lynchings of 4700 blacks,
"nigger-lovers," labor organizers and
communists since 1880. At every stage
it has received support from the milit
ary, police and civilian authorities.
We should make no mistake about it.
The Klan is not "just" a problem for
blacks who bear the direct brunt of its

terror. Historically over a quarter of its
victims have been whites.
At Stanford we see many manifesta
tions of racism. The University, be
cause it is not forced to do otherwise,
continues its investments in many of
the 350 U.S. firms supplying capital to
South Africa to keep the apartheid
economy growing. It is, after all, good
business when the Big Three can get
away with paying biack auto workers
56 cents per hour or when workers at
Goodyear and General Tire earn only
$23 per week.
Polaroid provides photos for the
notorious pass system while IBM
supplies the police with the computer
system necessary to make it work. The
latest wave of rebellion shows that
blacks (and their few white suppor
ters) will eventually put an end to this
system. If we wish to support people
working under virtual slave labor, if
we want to avoid being forced to serve
in a war to preserve this sytem, we
have to build a movement to halt in
vestment in South Africa.
It is impossible to discuss racism in
the military and in the University's in
vestment policy and yet ignore the
general attack underway against
minorities on this campus, llakke
came to Stanford before the Supreme
Court, as affirmative action in both
admissions and hiring has effectively
vanished. Stanford now threatens to
eliminate theChicano Affairs Office, a
small concession in making this uni
versity a more comfortable place for
Chicano students.
For those of us who do not profit
from racism, who do not want to fight
in another racist, imperialist war, who
do not want to attend a lily-white uni
versity, for those of us who want to live
in a non-racist society, a multi-racial
movement to fight and defeat racism is
the only answer. Tonight's movie, "The
Last Grave at Dimbaza," and meeting on
racism and Stanford will start in that di
rection.

filed against any whites.
The only action has been to add to
the Klan's racist terror by prosecuting
14 brave black Marines who finally
had enough and decided to fight the
Klan.
The corps has stacked the deck
against them: military defense lawyers
who were six months out of training,
an experienced prosecution, separate
trials, and solitary confinement (ended
by an appeal of defense committee

Long list of crimes
The phenomenon is not isolated.
Klan incidents have been reported
from all the armed services. The KKK
has a sordid history intimately con
nected to the lynchings of 4700 blacks,
"nigger-lovers," labor organizers and
communists since 1880. At every stage
it has received support from the milit
ary, police and civilian authorities.
We should make no mistake about it.
The Klan is not "just" a problem for

At Stanford we see many manifesta
tions of racism. The University, be

continues its investments in many of
the 350 U.S. firms supplying capital to
South Africa to keep the apartheid
economy growing. It is, after all, good
business when the Big Three can get
away with paying biack auto workers
56 cents per hour or when workers at
Goodyear and General Tire earn only
$23 per week.
Polaroid provides photos for the
notorious pass system while IBM
supplies the police with the computer
system necessary to make it work. The
latest wave of rebellion shows that
blacks (and their few white suppor
ters) will eventually put an end to this
system. If we wish to support people
working under virtual slave labor, if
we want to avoid being forced to serve
in a war to preserve this sytem, we
have to build a movement to halt in
vestment in South Africa.
It is impossible to discuss racism in
the military and in the University's in
vestment policy and yet ignore the
general attack underway against
minorities on this campus, llakke
came to Stanford before the Supreme
Court, as affirmative action in both
admissions and hiring has effectively
vanished. Stanford now threatens to
eliminate theChicano Affairs Office, a
small concession in making this uni
versity a more comfortable place for
Chicano students.
For those of us who do not profit
from racism, who do not want to fight
in another racist, imperialist war, who
do not want to attend a lily-white uni
versity, for those of us who want to live
in a non-racist society, a multi-racial
movement to fight and defeat racism is
the only answer. Tonight's movie, "The
Last Grave at Dimbaza," and meeting on
racism and Stanford will start in that di
rection.

On Nov. 13, 1976, 14 black Marines
gained entrance to what they took to be
a meeting of the Ku Klux klan in the
barracks of Camp Pendleton, Califor
nia. A 20-second fight resulted in in
juries. Charges including conspiracy
to commit murder have been placed
against the 14, and if convicted, they
may spend a good part of their lives in
the brig.
The Marine Corps first denied the
existence of the KKK on the base and
portrayed the 14 as having randomly
attacked whites. But an originally
suppressed Naval Investigative Ser
vice report reveals that directly after
the fight, a group of admitted KKKers
in the adjoining room emerged into the
hallway armed with knives and clubs.
All the barracks doors on that floor
were covered with Klan "White Man
— Wake Up" stickers. The KKK mem
bers had been active at Pendleton for
over a year prior to the incident, and
their organizing had become bolder as

their numbers grew, without any hin
drance from the Marines.
Klan's influence
The Marine Corps is known for its
tight control of very detail of its mem
bers' lives. Why was the Klan toler
ated? The base commandant said, "If
this group exists, it has done nothing
to injure the interests of the military.
So we have taken no action."
But KKK Marines have openly
sported the Klan uniform of cowboy
boots and hat with KKK card attached
while on duty. Just prior to Nov. 13, a
black returning to base was jumped by
a gang of whites; a Klanner dropped
his knife in the mess hall and was
loudly told to pick up his "nigger
sticker." Just after the incident, a black
was found handcuffed to the shower
with a plastic bag over his head and
razor and knife slashes over his body.
The corps called this, "attempted
suicide." No charges have ever been
filed against any whites.

we want to avoid being forced to serve
in a war to preserve this sytem, we
have to build a movement to halt in
vestment in South Africa.
It is impossible to discuss racism in
the military and in the University's in
vestment policy and yet ignore the
general attack underway against
minorities on this campus, llakke
came to Stanford before the Supreme
Court, as affirmative action in both
admissions and hiring has effectively
vanished. Stanford now threatens to
eliminate theChicano Affairs Office, a
small concession in making this uni
versity a more comfortable place for
Chicano students.
For those of us who do not profit
from racism, who do not want to fight
in another racist, imperialist war, who
do not want to attend a lily-white uni
versity, for those of us who want to live
in a non-racist society, a multi-racial
movement to fight and defeat racism is
the only answer. Tonight's movie, "The
Last Grave at Dimbaza," and meeting on
racism and Stanford will start in that di
rection.
