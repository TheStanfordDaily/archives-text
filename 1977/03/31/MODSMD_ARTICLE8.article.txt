## Stevens boycott a play for power 
### 
First came a press conference at the
Manhattan Church of the Nazarene
(former Lambs Club) on West 44th
Street. One of the speakers was Paul
O'Dwyer, President of the New York
City Council, who feared for the future
of civil ization if J.P. Stevens remains at
large. "How can we tell our children to
respect law and order," he asked re
porters, "if the very leaders of industry
don't do it?" Addie Jackson, a
handsome woman in wool cap and
khaki jacket who said she had worked
in the Stevens plant in Statesboro, Ga.,
described the horrors of such
employment. Warming to her theme,
her voice rising into the microphone,
she declared: "Believe it or not, it's
worse than slavery to work for a com
pany like J.P. Stevens." Applause
erupted.
Outside a crowd, estimated by
police at HOO. was milling around,
waiting for the march on Stevens To
wer. It was a threadbare spectacle,
union officials and press filing out of
the defunct Lambs Club while the
rank-and-file formed ranks in front of
the shuttered Hudson Theater. But
placards there were in abundance.
Annual meeting
Thereupon, according to an on-the
spot dispatch from our intrepid cor
respondent, James Grant, the action
shifted to embattled corporate head
quarters at Stevens Tower, where
management, against heavy odds, was
seeking to hold the annual meeting.
Quite a session it was, too, with stoc
kholders, concerned and otherwise,
overflowing the premises. And the
not-so-loyal opposition was out in
force: the Amalgamated Clothing &
Textile Workers Union, AFL-CIO,
which for more than a decade has vai
nly sought to unionize the company's
40,000 work force; a contingent from
Princeton University; the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility.
Outside marched a chanting picket
line.
With enemies like that, who needs
friends? Yet according to the AC7TWU,
the boycott of J.P. Stevens has evoked

favorable comment in dozens of news
papers and magazines. In an effort to
redress the balance, we are moved to
take up the cudgels for the company.
Which is not to say that it need, or
should, be defended across-the-board.
George Meany has called J.P. Stevens
the "number one violator of the na
tion's labor laws"; with all due respect
to the head of the AFL-CIO for his un
yielding stand on Solzhenitsyn and
wage-price controls, that's
bargaining-table balderdash. Yet Ste
vens repeatedly has transgressed the
rules and regulations of the National
Labor Relations Board (about which
more below). Some of its employes
have been guilty of an illegal excess of
zeal. Management, in turn, has shown
an unfortunate tendency to blame its
recurrent economic woes on foreign
competition, and persistently to press
for quotas or other curbs on imports.
'Not perfect'
"We do not claim" so the chairman
of the board told last week's annual
meeting, "to be perfect." That's a point
which neither friend nor foe would
dispute. Yet the same is true of the
opposition: despite the cloak of sanc
tity in which it has been wrapped, the
union comes before the bar of public
opinion with far from clean hands. On
the issue of violations of labor law, for
example, the twin predecessors of the
recently merged ACTWU have a re
cord which, notably regarding the
grave nature of the proven offenses,
including assault on property and per
sons, makes Stevens' look like a bunch
of parking tickets.
By the same token, in one NLRB
election after another, the company's
workers in plant after plant have voted
to reject the union, a firm position
which the boycott, by nakedly
threatening their livelihoods (as well
as those of other innocent parties),
will doubtless do little or nothing to
soften. As knowledgeable observers
agree, the campaign to force Stevens
to its knees is merely the opening gun
in labor's aggressive new drive to or
ganize the South. Behind the cry for

social justice, whatever that may
mean, lurks the ceaseless union quest
for power.
Ceaseless and virulent. The ACTWU
— or, more precisely, its original com
ponents, the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers Union and the Textile Work
ers Union — vainly has been trying to
organize J.P. Stevens, a leading South
ern textile manufacturer, for well over
a decade. Since the two joined forces
in mid-1976, and especially since a
candidate beholden to Big Labor
moved into the White House, the drive
has picked up speed. Backed by the
AFL-CIO, and with a war chest put at
millions, the ACTWU has opened
headquarters in 28 cities throughout
the country, with a staff of 40, and
launched a nationwide boycott of Ste
vens' products.
Law-breaker
On the latter score, let's look harder
at the company's record as notorious
labor law-breaker. Most of its il
legalities involve the National Labor
Relations Board (generally upheld by
the courts), an agency the impartiality
and expertise of which are not beyond
cavil. Ten years ago, the "American
Craftsmen," official publication of the
International Society of Skilled
Trades, called it, among other more
pungent names, "that infamous tri
bunal" which seeks to make skilled
workers "slaves of the industrial un
ions." Bethatas it may, timeand again
the board has ruled against Stevens,
thereby effectively fraying its corpo
rate image, on grounds that strike a
layman as contrived and specious.
One employe who failed to appear
on his own behalf, and another who
admitted to hitting a supervisor, were
both ordered reinstated with back pay.
According to the board, a weaver who
spoiled four times as much work as her
159 counterparts combined was fired
for being pro-union. The agency made
a similar finding in the ironic case of a
pro-union hosiery quality checker;
based on uncontroverted evidence, the
latter threatened subordinates who
didn't share her views, and, in a trans

parent effort to carry out her threats,
falsified a quality control inspection
report.
Unfair practices
Contrast such "illegalities" with the
union record. In 1974, according to a
fact-finding pamphlet which Stevens
has just issued, the union was judged
to have committed an unfair labor
practice by refusing to meet with the
bargaining agent for its own employes.
In other cases, it has punished dissi
dents within its ranks by fines and
compulsory discharge. Employes who
have fallen out of favor with union
leaders "have been threatened with
personal injury, damage to their prop
erty . . . loss of their right to fair rep
resentation by the union during a grie
vance procedure and loss of their
iobs."
Dixie slump
Small wonder that over the years,
organized labor has enjoyed scant suc
cor in the South. After 40 campaigns
and 15 requests for secret-ballot elec
tions (three subsequently withdrawn),
the union has triumphed only once,
extending its sway over a group of
plants at Roanoke Rapids, N.C., which
employs perhaps seven per cent of
Stevens' total work force. Its victory
was narrow and even today by no
means uncontested: a group known as
the Employes Educational Committee
is vigorously seeking decertification.
As to the boycott, labor has used this
blunt instrument with some success
against both Farah Manufacturing and
Gallo Wine; whether it will succeed
against a broadly diversified enter
prise which sells much of its output
unbranded remains to be seen. In any
case, by jeopardizing the jobs of those
whom it allegedly is trying to help,
and intruding upon third party rights,
the boycott strikes us as a curious way
either to show compassion or achieve
"social justice."

First came a press conference at the
Manhattan Church of the Nazarene
(former Lambs Club) on West 44th
Street. One of the speakers was Paul
O'Dwyer, President of the New York
City Council, who feared for the future
of civil ization if J.P. Stevens remains at
large. "How can we tell our children to
respect law and order," he asked re
porters, "if the very leaders of industry
don't do it?" Addie Jackson, a
handsome woman in wool cap and
khaki jacket who said she had worked
in the Stevens plant in Statesboro, Ga.,
described the horrors of such
employment. Warming to her theme,
her voice rising into the microphone,
she declared: "Believe it or not, it's
worse than slavery to work for a com
pany like J.P. Stevens." Applause
erupted.
Outside a crowd, estimated by
police at HOO. was milling around,
waiting for the march on Stevens To
wer. It was a threadbare spectacle,
union officials and press filing out of
the defunct Lambs Club while the
rank-and-file formed ranks in front of
the shuttered Hudson Theater. But
placards there were in abundance.
Annual meeting
Thereupon, according to an on-the
spot dispatch from our intrepid cor
respondent, James Grant, the action
shifted to embattled corporate head
quarters at Stevens Tower, where
management, against heavy odds, was
seeking to hold the annual meeting.
Quite a session it was, too, with stoc
kholders, concerned and otherwise,
overflowing the premises. And the
not-so-loyal opposition was out in
force: the Amalgamated Clothing &
Textile Workers Union, AFL-CIO,
which for more than a decade has vai
nly sought to unionize the company's
40,000 work force; a contingent from
Princeton University; the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility.
Outside marched a chanting picket
line.
With enemies like that, who needs
friends? Yet according to the AC7TWU,
the boycott of J.P. Stevens has evoked

favorable comment in dozens of news
papers and magazines. In an effort to
redress the balance, we are moved to
take up the cudgels for the company.
Which is not to say that it need, or
should, be defended across-the-board.
George Meany has called J.P. Stevens
the "number one violator of the na
tion's labor laws"; with all due respect
to the head of the AFL-CIO for his un
yielding stand on Solzhenitsyn and
wage-price controls, that's
bargaining-table balderdash. Yet Ste
vens repeatedly has transgressed the
rules and regulations of the National
Labor Relations Board (about which
more below). Some of its employes
have been guilty of an illegal excess of
zeal. Management, in turn, has shown
an unfortunate tendency to blame its
recurrent economic woes on foreign
competition, and persistently to press
for quotas or other curbs on imports.
'Not perfect'
"We do not claim" so the chairman
of the board told last week's annual
meeting, "to be perfect." That's a point
which neither friend nor foe would
dispute. Yet the same is true of the
opposition: despite the cloak of sanc
tity in which it has been wrapped, the
union comes before the bar of public
opinion with far from clean hands. On
the issue of violations of labor law, for
example, the twin predecessors of the
recently merged ACTWU have a re
cord which, notably regarding the
grave nature of the proven offenses,
including assault on property and per
sons, makes Stevens' look like a bunch
of parking tickets.
By the same token, in one NLRB
election after another, the company's
workers in plant after plant have voted
to reject the union, a firm position
which the boycott, by nakedly
threatening their livelihoods (as well
as those of other innocent parties),
will doubtless do little or nothing to
soften. As knowledgeable observers
agree, the campaign to force Stevens
to its knees is merely the opening gun
in labor's aggressive new drive to or
ganize the South. Behind the cry for

social justice, whatever that may
mean, lurks the ceaseless union quest
for power.
Ceaseless and virulent. The ACTWU
— or, more precisely, its original com
ponents, the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers Union and the Textile Work
ers Union — vainly has been trying to
organize J.P. Stevens, a leading South
ern textile manufacturer, for well over
a decade. Since the two joined forces
in mid-1976, and especially since a
candidate beholden to Big Labor
moved into the White House, the drive
has picked up speed. Backed by the
AFL-CIO, and with a war chest put at
millions, the ACTWU has opened
headquarters in 28 cities throughout
the country, with a staff of 40, and
launched a nationwide boycott of Ste
vens' products.
Law-breaker
On the latter score, let's look harder
at the company's record as notorious
labor law-breaker. Most of its il
legalities involve the National Labor
Relations Board (generally upheld by
the courts), an agency the impartiality
and expertise of which are not beyond
cavil. Ten years ago, the "American
Craftsmen," official publication of the
International Society of Skilled
Trades, called it, among other more
pungent names, "that infamous tri
bunal" which seeks to make skilled
workers "slaves of the industrial un
ions." Bethatas it may, timeand again
the board has ruled against Stevens,
thereby effectively fraying its corpo
rate image, on grounds that strike a
layman as contrived and specious.
One employe who failed to appear
on his own behalf, and another who
admitted to hitting a supervisor, were
both ordered reinstated with back pay.
According to the board, a weaver who
spoiled four times as much work as her
159 counterparts combined was fired
for being pro-union. The agency made
a similar finding in the ironic case of a
pro-union hosiery quality checker;
based on uncontroverted evidence, the
latter threatened subordinates who
didn't share her views, and, in a trans

parent effort to carry out her threats,
falsified a quality control inspection
report.
Unfair practices
Contrast such "illegalities" with the
union record. In 1974, according to a
fact-finding pamphlet which Stevens
has just issued, the union was judged
to have committed an unfair labor
practice by refusing to meet with the
bargaining agent for its own employes.
In other cases, it has punished dissi
dents within its ranks by fines and
compulsory discharge. Employes who
have fallen out of favor with union
leaders "have been threatened with
personal injury, damage to their prop
erty . . . loss of their right to fair rep
resentation by the union during a grie
vance procedure and loss of their
iobs."
Dixie slump
Small wonder that over the years,
organized labor has enjoyed scant suc
cor in the South. After 40 campaigns
and 15 requests for secret-ballot elec
tions (three subsequently withdrawn),
the union has triumphed only once,
extending its sway over a group of
plants at Roanoke Rapids, N.C., which
employs perhaps seven per cent of
Stevens' total work force. Its victory
was narrow and even today by no
means uncontested: a group known as
the Employes Educational Committee
is vigorously seeking decertification.
As to the boycott, labor has used this
blunt instrument with some success
against both Farah Manufacturing and
Gallo Wine; whether it will succeed
against a broadly diversified enter
prise which sells much of its output
unbranded remains to be seen. In any
case, by jeopardizing the jobs of those
whom it allegedly is trying to help,
and intruding upon third party rights,
the boycott strikes us as a curious way
either to show compassion or achieve
"social justice."

First came a press conference at the
Manhattan Church of the Nazarene
(former Lambs Club) on West 44th
Street. One of the speakers was Paul
O'Dwyer, President of the New York
City Council, who feared for the future
of civil ization if J.P. Stevens remains at
large. "How can we tell our children to
respect law and order," he asked re
porters, "if the very leaders of industry
don't do it?" Addie Jackson, a
handsome woman in wool cap and
khaki jacket who said she had worked
in the Stevens plant in Statesboro, Ga.,
described the horrors of such
employment. Warming to her theme,
her voice rising into the microphone,
she declared: "Believe it or not, it's
worse than slavery to work for a com
pany like J.P. Stevens." Applause
erupted.
Outside a crowd, estimated by
police at HOO. was milling around,
waiting for the march on Stevens To
wer. It was a threadbare spectacle,
union officials and press filing out of
the defunct Lambs Club while the
rank-and-file formed ranks in front of
the shuttered Hudson Theater. But
placards there were in abundance.
Annual meeting
Thereupon, according to an on-the
spot dispatch from our intrepid cor
respondent, James Grant, the action
shifted to embattled corporate head
quarters at Stevens Tower, where
management, against heavy odds, was
seeking to hold the annual meeting.
Quite a session it was, too, with stoc
kholders, concerned and otherwise,
overflowing the premises. And the
not-so-loyal opposition was out in
force: the Amalgamated Clothing &
Textile Workers Union, AFL-CIO,
which for more than a decade has vai
nly sought to unionize the company's
40,000 work force; a contingent from
Princeton University; the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility.
Outside marched a chanting picket
line.
With enemies like that, who needs
friends? Yet according to the AC7TWU,
the boycott of J.P. Stevens has evoked

favorable comment in dozens of news
papers and magazines. In an effort to
redress the balance, we are moved to
take up the cudgels for the company.
Which is not to say that it need, or
should, be defended across-the-board.
George Meany has called J.P. Stevens
the "number one violator of the na
tion's labor laws"; with all due respect
to the head of the AFL-CIO for his un
yielding stand on Solzhenitsyn and
wage-price controls, that's
bargaining-table balderdash. Yet Ste
vens repeatedly has transgressed the
rules and regulations of the National
Labor Relations Board (about which
more below). Some of its employes
have been guilty of an illegal excess of
zeal. Management, in turn, has shown
an unfortunate tendency to blame its
recurrent economic woes on foreign
competition, and persistently to press
for quotas or other curbs on imports.
'Not perfect'
"We do not claim" so the chairman
of the board told last week's annual
meeting, "to be perfect." That's a point
which neither friend nor foe would
dispute. Yet the same is true of the
opposition: despite the cloak of sanc
tity in which it has been wrapped, the
union comes before the bar of public
opinion with far from clean hands. On
the issue of violations of labor law, for
example, the twin predecessors of the
recently merged ACTWU have a re
cord which, notably regarding the
grave nature of the proven offenses,
including assault on property and per
sons, makes Stevens' look like a bunch
of parking tickets.
By the same token, in one NLRB
election after another, the company's
workers in plant after plant have voted
to reject the union, a firm position
which the boycott, by nakedly
threatening their livelihoods (as well
as those of other innocent parties),
will doubtless do little or nothing to
soften. As knowledgeable observers
agree, the campaign to force Stevens
to its knees is merely the opening gun
in labor's aggressive new drive to or
ganize the South. Behind the cry for

social justice, whatever that may
mean, lurks the ceaseless union quest
for power.
Ceaseless and virulent. The ACTWU
— or, more precisely, its original com
ponents, the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers Union and the Textile Work
ers Union — vainly has been trying to
organize J.P. Stevens, a leading South
ern textile manufacturer, for well over
a decade. Since the two joined forces
in mid-1976, and especially since a
candidate beholden to Big Labor
moved into the White House, the drive
has picked up speed. Backed by the
AFL-CIO, and with a war chest put at
millions, the ACTWU has opened
headquarters in 28 cities throughout
the country, with a staff of 40, and
launched a nationwide boycott of Ste
vens' products.
Law-breaker
On the latter score, let's look harder
at the company's record as notorious
labor law-breaker. Most of its il
legalities involve the National Labor
Relations Board (generally upheld by
the courts), an agency the impartiality
and expertise of which are not beyond
cavil. Ten years ago, the "American
Craftsmen," official publication of the
International Society of Skilled
Trades, called it, among other more
pungent names, "that infamous tri
bunal" which seeks to make skilled
workers "slaves of the industrial un
ions." Bethatas it may, timeand again
the board has ruled against Stevens,
thereby effectively fraying its corpo
rate image, on grounds that strike a
layman as contrived and specious.
One employe who failed to appear
on his own behalf, and another who
admitted to hitting a supervisor, were
both ordered reinstated with back pay.
According to the board, a weaver who
spoiled four times as much work as her
159 counterparts combined was fired
for being pro-union. The agency made
a similar finding in the ironic case of a
pro-union hosiery quality checker;
based on uncontroverted evidence, the
latter threatened subordinates who
didn't share her views, and, in a trans

parent effort to carry out her threats,
falsified a quality control inspection
report.
Unfair practices
Contrast such "illegalities" with the
union record. In 1974, according to a
fact-finding pamphlet which Stevens
has just issued, the union was judged
to have committed an unfair labor
practice by refusing to meet with the
bargaining agent for its own employes.
In other cases, it has punished dissi
dents within its ranks by fines and
compulsory discharge. Employes who
have fallen out of favor with union
leaders "have been threatened with
personal injury, damage to their prop
erty . . . loss of their right to fair rep
resentation by the union during a grie
vance procedure and loss of their
iobs."
Dixie slump
Small wonder that over the years,
organized labor has enjoyed scant suc
cor in the South. After 40 campaigns
and 15 requests for secret-ballot elec
tions (three subsequently withdrawn),
the union has triumphed only once,
extending its sway over a group of
plants at Roanoke Rapids, N.C., which
employs perhaps seven per cent of
Stevens' total work force. Its victory
was narrow and even today by no
means uncontested: a group known as
the Employes Educational Committee
is vigorously seeking decertification.
As to the boycott, labor has used this
blunt instrument with some success
against both Farah Manufacturing and
Gallo Wine; whether it will succeed
against a broadly diversified enter
prise which sells much of its output
unbranded remains to be seen. In any
case, by jeopardizing the jobs of those
whom it allegedly is trying to help,
and intruding upon third party rights,
the boycott strikes us as a curious way
either to show compassion or achieve
"social justice."

First came a press conference at the
Manhattan Church of the Nazarene
(former Lambs Club) on West 44th
Street. One of the speakers was Paul
O'Dwyer, President of the New York
City Council, who feared for the future
of civil ization if J.P. Stevens remains at
large. "How can we tell our children to
respect law and order," he asked re
porters, "if the very leaders of industry
don't do it?" Addie Jackson, a
handsome woman in wool cap and
khaki jacket who said she had worked
in the Stevens plant in Statesboro, Ga.,
described the horrors of such
employment. Warming to her theme,
her voice rising into the microphone,
she declared: "Believe it or not, it's
worse than slavery to work for a com
pany like J.P. Stevens." Applause
erupted.
Outside a crowd, estimated by
police at HOO. was milling around,
waiting for the march on Stevens To
wer. It was a threadbare spectacle,
union officials and press filing out of
the defunct Lambs Club while the
rank-and-file formed ranks in front of
the shuttered Hudson Theater. But
placards there were in abundance.
Annual meeting
Thereupon, according to an on-the
spot dispatch from our intrepid cor
respondent, James Grant, the action
shifted to embattled corporate head
quarters at Stevens Tower, where
management, against heavy odds, was
seeking to hold the annual meeting.
Quite a session it was, too, with stoc
kholders, concerned and otherwise,
overflowing the premises. And the
not-so-loyal opposition was out in
force: the Amalgamated Clothing &
Textile Workers Union, AFL-CIO,
which for more than a decade has vai
nly sought to unionize the company's
40,000 work force; a contingent from
Princeton University; the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility.
Outside marched a chanting picket
line.
With enemies like that, who needs
friends? Yet according to the AC7TWU,
the boycott of J.P. Stevens has evoked

favorable comment in dozens of news
papers and magazines. In an effort to
redress the balance, we are moved to
take up the cudgels for the company.
Which is not to say that it need, or
should, be defended across-the-board.
George Meany has called J.P. Stevens
the "number one violator of the na
tion's labor laws"; with all due respect
to the head of the AFL-CIO for his un
yielding stand on Solzhenitsyn and
wage-price controls, that's
bargaining-table balderdash. Yet Ste
vens repeatedly has transgressed the
rules and regulations of the National
Labor Relations Board (about which
more below). Some of its employes
have been guilty of an illegal excess of
zeal. Management, in turn, has shown
an unfortunate tendency to blame its
recurrent economic woes on foreign
competition, and persistently to press
for quotas or other curbs on imports.
'Not perfect'
"We do not claim" so the chairman
of the board told last week's annual
meeting, "to be perfect." That's a point
which neither friend nor foe would
dispute. Yet the same is true of the
opposition: despite the cloak of sanc
tity in which it has been wrapped, the
union comes before the bar of public
opinion with far from clean hands. On
the issue of violations of labor law, for
example, the twin predecessors of the
recently merged ACTWU have a re
cord which, notably regarding the
grave nature of the proven offenses,
including assault on property and per
sons, makes Stevens' look like a bunch
of parking tickets.
By the same token, in one NLRB
election after another, the company's
workers in plant after plant have voted
to reject the union, a firm position
which the boycott, by nakedly
threatening their livelihoods (as well
as those of other innocent parties),
will doubtless do little or nothing to
soften. As knowledgeable observers
agree, the campaign to force Stevens
to its knees is merely the opening gun
in labor's aggressive new drive to or
ganize the South. Behind the cry for

social justice, whatever that may
mean, lurks the ceaseless union quest
for power.
Ceaseless and virulent. The ACTWU
— or, more precisely, its original com
ponents, the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers Union and the Textile Work
ers Union — vainly has been trying to
organize J.P. Stevens, a leading South
ern textile manufacturer, for well over
a decade. Since the two joined forces
in mid-1976, and especially since a
candidate beholden to Big Labor
moved into the White House, the drive
has picked up speed. Backed by the
AFL-CIO, and with a war chest put at
millions, the ACTWU has opened
headquarters in 28 cities throughout
the country, with a staff of 40, and
launched a nationwide boycott of Ste
vens' products.
Law-breaker
On the latter score, let's look harder
at the company's record as notorious
labor law-breaker. Most of its il
legalities involve the National Labor
Relations Board (generally upheld by
the courts), an agency the impartiality
and expertise of which are not beyond
cavil. Ten years ago, the "American
Craftsmen," official publication of the
International Society of Skilled
Trades, called it, among other more
pungent names, "that infamous tri
bunal" which seeks to make skilled
workers "slaves of the industrial un
ions." Bethatas it may, timeand again
the board has ruled against Stevens,
thereby effectively fraying its corpo
rate image, on grounds that strike a
layman as contrived and specious.
One employe who failed to appear
on his own behalf, and another who
admitted to hitting a supervisor, were
both ordered reinstated with back pay.
According to the board, a weaver who
spoiled four times as much work as her
159 counterparts combined was fired
for being pro-union. The agency made
a similar finding in the ironic case of a
pro-union hosiery quality checker;
based on uncontroverted evidence, the
latter threatened subordinates who
didn't share her views, and, in a trans

parent effort to carry out her threats,
falsified a quality control inspection
report.
Unfair practices
Contrast such "illegalities" with the
union record. In 1974, according to a
fact-finding pamphlet which Stevens
has just issued, the union was judged
to have committed an unfair labor
practice by refusing to meet with the
bargaining agent for its own employes.
In other cases, it has punished dissi
dents within its ranks by fines and
compulsory discharge. Employes who
have fallen out of favor with union
leaders "have been threatened with
personal injury, damage to their prop
erty . . . loss of their right to fair rep
resentation by the union during a grie
vance procedure and loss of their
iobs."
Dixie slump
Small wonder that over the years,
organized labor has enjoyed scant suc
cor in the South. After 40 campaigns
and 15 requests for secret-ballot elec
tions (three subsequently withdrawn),
the union has triumphed only once,
extending its sway over a group of
plants at Roanoke Rapids, N.C., which
employs perhaps seven per cent of
Stevens' total work force. Its victory
was narrow and even today by no
means uncontested: a group known as
the Employes Educational Committee
is vigorously seeking decertification.
As to the boycott, labor has used this
blunt instrument with some success
against both Farah Manufacturing and
Gallo Wine; whether it will succeed
against a broadly diversified enter
prise which sells much of its output
unbranded remains to be seen. In any
case, by jeopardizing the jobs of those
whom it allegedly is trying to help,
and intruding upon third party rights,
the boycott strikes us as a curious way
either to show compassion or achieve
"social justice."
