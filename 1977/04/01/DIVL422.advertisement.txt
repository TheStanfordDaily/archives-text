THE DEAN OF BEER'S QUICKIE QUIZ.
Q: A mini-brewery is:
a) Hidden in a basement somewhere in Greektown.
b) The result of trying to make Broken Toe. Idaho,
the beer capital of the world.
c) The right way to pretest beer ingredients.
d) Both (a) and (c).
A: (c) If you answered this question (a),
you obviously know something I don't.
And you are in a lot of trouble.
Now. as for the correct answer.
Yes, Schlitz actually does have a mini-brewery
where they test-brew the ingredients that go into
Schlitz. And if they're not right, they never go
into Schlitz.
Which is something to remember the next time
you're going into your favorite place for a beer.
You know which one. there's just one word
FOR BEER.
- AND YOU KNOW IT.
