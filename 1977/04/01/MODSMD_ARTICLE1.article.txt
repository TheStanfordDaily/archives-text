# Kennedy rescinds saccharine decision
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
In his first official act as commis
sioner of the Food and Drug Administ
ration (FDA), Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy yesterday reversed last
month's FDA ruling banning the sale
of saccharine.
"The Canadian study just wasn't
conclusive enough to warrant removal
of saccharine as a dietary device,"
Kennedy said, referring to experi
ments in which rats fed huge doses of
the artificial sweetener showed higher
than normal bladder cancer rates.
The ban would have gone into effect
in July.
Kennedy's predecessor, former Act
ing Commissioner Sherwin Gardner,
called the reversal "inexcusable."
"The Delaney clause (a 1958 addi
tion to the Food and Drug Act) clearly
prohibits the sale of food additives
found carcinogenic in animals. That
was the case here."
Hard proof
But Kennedy said the clause as
sumes hard proof has been found of the
additive's harmful effects. "When 10
or 15 studies have shown no appreci
able cancer increases, you can't simply
take the one study that does show
harm and call that definitive," he said.
Kennedy's decision was praised by
Medical School Assoc. Prof. Orland
Soave, director of laboratory animal
medicine. "Different types of laborat
ory animals react in diverse ways to

the same substance. A single set of re
sults can't be counted on in a matter of
this much importance."
Soave also questioned the wisdom
of the Delaney clause, saying findings
about rats cannot be transferred au
tomatically to humans and that foods
should not be banned on the basis of
animal experiments alone.
Prior to Kennedy's action, several
congressmen, led by Rep. Barbara
Mikulski (D-Md.), proposed amending
the clause to permit the FDA to weigh
the carcinogenic effects of food addi
tives against other factors, such as the
use of saccharine to fight obesity, in
deciding whether to remove them.
Temporary half
Now, according to a spokesman in
Mikulski's Capitol Hill office, the
drive for amendment has halted tem
porarily. "It appears the FDA has some
sensible people in charge now," the
spokesman said. "This will give us
time to re-examine the problem before
proposing any changes in the law."
Kennedy cautioned the reversal was
not a clean bil 1 of health for saccharine.
"We will continue to commission
studies on the harmful effects of all
suspect additives, as well as encourage
the development and marketing of safe
substitutes."
He predicted, however, that "for the
time being, saccharine will probably
remain as the dominant artificial
sweetener on the market."
Health, Education and Welfare Sec
retary Joseph Califano, who earlier
criticized the FDA's ruling but said it
was up to the agency, an HEW branch,
to interpret the law for itself, sup
ported Kennedy.
"It is clear that the law has gone too
far when, in attempting to save a few
people from uncertain harm, it con
demns a greater number to more cer
tain peril," Califano said.
The White House, which has been
deluged by letters from saccharine
users critical of the original FDA deci
sion, had no comment on the reversal.
New sweeteners
The search for new sweeteneing
agents, which picked up speed after
the announced ban, will continue un
abated, according to Economics Prof.
Walter Falcon, director of the Food Re

search Institute.
"Aspartame, Neo-DHC and xylitol
are just three of the compounds that
are getting more attention right now,"
Falcon said. "I can easily see one of
those hitting the market in the next
couple of years as a replacement for
saccharine."
John Williams, public relations of
ficer for the Canteen Corporation,
which owns campus vending
machines, said Kennedy's action will
save the company — and students —
money.
"The cost of converting all our
machine to serving only sugar
sweetened drinks, coupled with the
increased demand for sugar which
would eventually have hit us in higher
prices, would have meant at least a five
cent price increase for the machines."

of the Delaney clause, saying findings
about rats cannot be transferred au
tomatically to humans and that foods
should not be banned on the basis of
animal experiments alone.
Prior to Kennedy's action, several
congressmen, led by Rep. Barbara
Mikulski (D-Md.), proposed amending
the clause to permit the FDA to weigh
the carcinogenic effects of food addi
tives against other factors, such as the
use of saccharine to fight obesity, in
deciding whether to remove them.
Temporary half
Now, according to a spokesman in
Mikulski's Capitol Hill office, the
drive for amendment has halted tem
porarily. "It appears the FDA has some
sensible people in charge now," the
spokesman said. "This will give us
time to re-examine the problem before
proposing any changes in the law."
Kennedy cautioned the reversal was
not a clean bil 1 of health for saccharine.
"We will continue to commission
studies on the harmful effects of all
suspect additives, as well as encourage
the development and marketing of safe
substitutes."
He predicted, however, that "for the
time being, saccharine will probably
remain as the dominant artificial
sweetener on the market."
Health, Education and Welfare Sec
retary Joseph Califano, who earlier
criticized the FDA's ruling but said it
was up to the agency, an HEW branch,
to interpret the law for itself, sup
ported Kennedy.
"It is clear that the law has gone too
far when, in attempting to save a few
people from uncertain harm, it con
demns a greater number to more cer
tain peril," Califano said.
The White House, which has been
deluged by letters from saccharine
users critical of the original FDA deci
sion, had no comment on the reversal.
New sweeteners
The search for new sweeteneing
agents, which picked up speed after
the announced ban, will continue un
abated, according to Economics Prof.
Walter Falcon, director of the Food Re

search Institute.
"Aspartame, Neo-DHC and xylitol
are just three of the compounds that
are getting more attention right now,"
Falcon said. "I can easily see one of
those hitting the market in the next
couple of years as a replacement for
saccharine."
John Williams, public relations of
ficer for the Canteen Corporation,
which owns campus vending
machines, said Kennedy's action will
save the company — and students —
money.
"The cost of converting all our
machine to serving only sugar
sweetened drinks, coupled with the
increased demand for sugar which
would eventually have hit us in higher
prices, would have meant at least a five
cent price increase for the machines."

In his first official act as commis
sioner of the Food and Drug Administ
ration (FDA), Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy yesterday reversed last
month's FDA ruling banning the sale
of saccharine.
"The Canadian study just wasn't
conclusive enough to warrant removal
of saccharine as a dietary device,"
Kennedy said, referring to experi
ments in which rats fed huge doses of
the artificial sweetener showed higher
than normal bladder cancer rates.
The ban would have gone into effect
in July.
Kennedy's predecessor, former Act
ing Commissioner Sherwin Gardner,
called the reversal "inexcusable."
"The Delaney clause (a 1958 addi
tion to the Food and Drug Act) clearly
prohibits the sale of food additives
found carcinogenic in animals. That
was the case here."
Hard proof
But Kennedy said the clause as
sumes hard proof has been found of the
additive's harmful effects. "When 10
or 15 studies have shown no appreci
able cancer increases, you can't simply
take the one study that does show
harm and call that definitive," he said.
Kennedy's decision was praised by
Medical School Assoc. Prof. Orland
Soave, director of laboratory animal
medicine. "Different types of laborat
ory animals react in diverse ways to

the same substance. A single set of re
sults can't be counted on in a matter of
this much importance."
Soave also questioned the wisdom
of the Delaney clause, saying findings
about rats cannot be transferred au
tomatically to humans and that foods
should not be banned on the basis of
animal experiments alone.
