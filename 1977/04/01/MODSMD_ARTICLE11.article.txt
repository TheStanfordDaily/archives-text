# Defense budget needs revaluation
## 
### 
I voted for Jimmy Carter largely on
the strength of his promise to cut de
fense spending by $5 to $7 billion. I am
therefore perplexed by the president's
apparent reluctance to follow through
on this commitment, despite Defense
Secretary Harold Brown's indication
that he will attempt to trim that
amount from the defense budget he
prepares for fiscal 1978. Furthermore,
the new administration is redefining
what is meant by a $5 to $7 billion
reduction, defining it as savings in ef
ficiency and not as an overall cut.
This ambiguous stance reflects the
current debate inside the Pentagon on
whether to escalate the arms race to
match the recent Soviet build-up or to
settle for the stable but perhaps tenu
ous essential equivalence we share
with our nemesis at this juncture.
In the belief that our national de
fense depends more on controlling
military escalation than on expansion,
and that we can do so without di
minishing our defense posture, I offer

the following suggestions to those
who are concerned with the question
of how to cut the defense budget.
Scrap B-l bomber
1) Scrap the B-l bomber. The cost of
developing and producing the prop-

osed 244 aircraft will be overwhelm
ing. While the B-l represents a fine
technical accomplishment, it should
not be produced, not because it isn't
cost efficient (it isn't), but because it is
unnecessary.
The Pentagon contends that the B-l

is essential to our defense, because the
current B-52 bomber force is aging.
This argument may be simply a
symptom of Chicken Little Syndrome.
"Our deterrence is falling down!" — as
dissent in defense circles now indi
cates. Many military experts hold that
the B-52 fleet can sarve well into the
1990'5.
But do we need a bomber fleet at all?
Pentagon reasoning on this question
runs along the lines of "conducting a
balanced nuclear war" — another of
those Strangelovian phrases — and
their scenario runs something like
this: it would take a Soviet interconti
nental ballistic missile (ICBM) about
30 minutes to reach the United States,
whereas the shorter-range submarine
launched ballistic missile (SI-BM)
would take only seven to 15 minutes.
If the U.S.S.R. launches its ICBMs
first, the American bombers will have
sufficient warning to get airborne, and
if it launches its SLBMs first, the Un
ited States will have adequate time to
launch its ICBMs. Thus, the argument
concludes, the United States could re
taliate against a Soviet first strike from
either land or sea.
Yet even in its own logic, the reason
ing is inconsistent, for the United
States could launch its ICBMs if the
Russians attacked either by land or sea.
The only thing gained by getting our
bombers airborne is an opportunity to
recall them, hence the "balanced nu
clear war." But we could gain similar
stability in refraining from launching
our own SLBMs in the six hours it
takes the B-l to reach Soviet airspace,
awaiting answer — I suppose — to an
ultimatum we would have transmitted
in that interval.
To assert that the B-l is the only al
ternative to launching our ICBMs is to
ignore the capability of our competent
SLBM force.
Compromise
In the spirit of compromise, for those
who maintain that America needs
bombers, granting that the B-52 can't
last forever, I still believe that there is a
satisfactory alternative to the B-l.
Were we to equip a fleet of modified
747s with cruise missiles the United
States would save two-thirds the cost
of the B-l on each plane, with the ad
vantage of greater penetrability of
Soviet airspace. Scrap the Trident
submarine. The Trident's attraction
stems from the fact that its missiles
have longer ranges than those the cur
rent Poseidon fleet is equipped with
and that it is a quieter vessel.
In response to the latter assertion, I

suggest that quietness is not necessar
ily an important factor in submarine
detection in a nuclear war.
Andtothefirst:theTrident 1 missile
was designed with the option of re
trofitting it into the existing 31
Poseidon submarines in mind.
Weapons systems like the Trident
submarine and the B-l bomber come
into being when there is inadequate
competition in the early stages of their
development and when vested in
terests — contractors and constituen
cies — gain control over their destiny.
Curb forces
3.) Reduce troop commitments out
side NATO. The United States stations
66,000 troops in South Korea. Consid
ering the inhumanity of the Park re
gime and the fact that South Korea has
the world's fifth largest army, the need
for American servicemen there is
dubious at best.
In addition to curbing our forces in
Thailand and the Philipines, the Un
ited States should also reevaluate its
presence in Japan. Given the recent de
tente with the Chinese, the 52,000 men
stationed there seem to serve in a
Teddy-bear capacity at best, especially
when one takes into account that Ja
pan's defense depends primarily on
the American nuclear deterrent.
Trim costs
4.) Trim pensions and manpower
costs. This is where the big saving in
the defense budget has to come. Over
half of the defense tax dollar goes into
this area and Rep. Les Aspin predicts
that pensions alone will syphon $34
billion off the budget by the end of this
century.
Carter has a real opportunity to slash
a few billion dollars in manpower
costs, provided he gets tough with
government unions and the Defense
Department.
We can no longer sacrifice social
programs to unnecessary defense ex
penditures. National security depends
equally upon political, social and
economic stability as it does on mili
tary posture.
The United States will achieve rela
tive safety in the next decade only if it
can determine with the Soviet Union
which weapons constitute deterrents
and which constitute threats.
An old axiom used to hold that in an
arms race, a nation had to spend in
order to keep from falling behind. In a
world that depends upon arms control,
I would alter that statement to read:
this nation must curb its spending or
lose its peace.

amount from the defense budget he
prepares for fiscal 1978. Furthermore,
the new administration is redefining
what is meant by a $5 to $7 billion
reduction, defining it as savings in ef
ficiency and not as an overall cut.
This ambiguous stance reflects the
current debate inside the Pentagon on
whether to escalate the arms race to
match the recent Soviet build-up or to
settle for the stable but perhaps tenu
ous essential equivalence we share
with our nemesis at this juncture.
In the belief that our national de
fense depends more on controlling
military escalation than on expansion,
and that we can do so without di
minishing our defense posture, I offer

the following suggestions to those
who are concerned with the question
of how to cut the defense budget.
Scrap B-l bomber
1) Scrap the B-l bomber. The cost of
developing and producing the prop-

osed 244 aircraft will be overwhelm
ing. While the B-l represents a fine
technical accomplishment, it should
not be produced, not because it isn't
cost efficient (it isn't), but because it is
unnecessary.
The Pentagon contends that the B-l

is essential to our defense, because the
current B-52 bomber force is aging.
This argument may be simply a
symptom of Chicken Little Syndrome.
"Our deterrence is falling down!" — as
dissent in defense circles now indi
cates. Many military experts hold that
the B-52 fleet can sarve well into the
1990'5.
But do we need a bomber fleet at all?
Pentagon reasoning on this question
runs along the lines of "conducting a
balanced nuclear war" — another of
those Strangelovian phrases — and
their scenario runs something like
this: it would take a Soviet interconti
nental ballistic missile (ICBM) about
30 minutes to reach the United States,
whereas the shorter-range submarine
launched ballistic missile (SI-BM)
would take only seven to 15 minutes.
If the U.S.S.R. launches its ICBMs
first, the American bombers will have
sufficient warning to get airborne, and
if it launches its SLBMs first, the Un
ited States will have adequate time to
launch its ICBMs. Thus, the argument
concludes, the United States could re
taliate against a Soviet first strike from
either land or sea.
Yet even in its own logic, the reason
ing is inconsistent, for the United
States could launch its ICBMs if the
Russians attacked either by land or sea.
The only thing gained by getting our
bombers airborne is an opportunity to
recall them, hence the "balanced nu
clear war." But we could gain similar
stability in refraining from launching
our own SLBMs in the six hours it
takes the B-l to reach Soviet airspace,
awaiting answer — I suppose — to an
ultimatum we would have transmitted
in that interval.
To assert that the B-l is the only al
ternative to launching our ICBMs is to
ignore the capability of our competent
SLBM force.
Compromise
In the spirit of compromise, for those
who maintain that America needs
bombers, granting that the B-52 can't
last forever, I still believe that there is a
satisfactory alternative to the B-l.
Were we to equip a fleet of modified
747s with cruise missiles the United
States would save two-thirds the cost
of the B-l on each plane, with the ad
vantage of greater penetrability of
Soviet airspace. Scrap the Trident
submarine. The Trident's attraction
stems from the fact that its missiles
have longer ranges than those the cur
rent Poseidon fleet is equipped with
and that it is a quieter vessel.
In response to the latter assertion, I

suggest that quietness is not necessar
ily an important factor in submarine
detection in a nuclear war.
Andtothefirst:theTrident 1 missile
was designed with the option of re
trofitting it into the existing 31
Poseidon submarines in mind.
Weapons systems like the Trident
submarine and the B-l bomber come
into being when there is inadequate
competition in the early stages of their
development and when vested in
terests — contractors and constituen
cies — gain control over their destiny.
Curb forces
3.) Reduce troop commitments out
side NATO. The United States stations
66,000 troops in South Korea. Consid
ering the inhumanity of the Park re
gime and the fact that South Korea has
the world's fifth largest army, the need
for American servicemen there is
dubious at best.
In addition to curbing our forces in
Thailand and the Philipines, the Un
ited States should also reevaluate its
presence in Japan. Given the recent de
tente with the Chinese, the 52,000 men
stationed there seem to serve in a
Teddy-bear capacity at best, especially
when one takes into account that Ja
pan's defense depends primarily on
the American nuclear deterrent.
Trim costs
4.) Trim pensions and manpower
costs. This is where the big saving in
the defense budget has to come. Over
half of the defense tax dollar goes into
this area and Rep. Les Aspin predicts
that pensions alone will syphon $34
billion off the budget by the end of this
century.
Carter has a real opportunity to slash
a few billion dollars in manpower
costs, provided he gets tough with
government unions and the Defense
Department.
We can no longer sacrifice social
programs to unnecessary defense ex
penditures. National security depends
equally upon political, social and
economic stability as it does on mili
tary posture.
The United States will achieve rela
tive safety in the next decade only if it
can determine with the Soviet Union
which weapons constitute deterrents
and which constitute threats.
An old axiom used to hold that in an
arms race, a nation had to spend in
order to keep from falling behind. In a
world that depends upon arms control,
I would alter that statement to read:
this nation must curb its spending or
lose its peace.

whether to escalate the arms race to
match the recent Soviet build-up or to
settle for the stable but perhaps tenu
ous essential equivalence we share
with our nemesis at this juncture.
In the belief that our national de
fense depends more on controlling
military escalation than on expansion,
and that we can do so without di
minishing our defense posture, I offer

the following suggestions to those
who are concerned with the question
of how to cut the defense budget.
Scrap B-l bomber
1) Scrap the B-l bomber. The cost of
developing and producing the prop-

osed 244 aircraft will be overwhelm
ing. While the B-l represents a fine
technical accomplishment, it should
not be produced, not because it isn't
cost efficient (it isn't), but because it is
unnecessary.
The Pentagon contends that the B-l

is essential to our defense, because the
current B-52 bomber force is aging.
This argument may be simply a
symptom of Chicken Little Syndrome.
"Our deterrence is falling down!" — as
dissent in defense circles now indi
cates. Many military experts hold that
the B-52 fleet can sarve well into the
1990'5.
But do we need a bomber fleet at all?
Pentagon reasoning on this question
runs along the lines of "conducting a
balanced nuclear war" — another of
those Strangelovian phrases — and
their scenario runs something like
this: it would take a Soviet interconti
nental ballistic missile (ICBM) about
30 minutes to reach the United States,
whereas the shorter-range submarine
launched ballistic missile (SI-BM)
would take only seven to 15 minutes.
If the U.S.S.R. launches its ICBMs
first, the American bombers will have
sufficient warning to get airborne, and
if it launches its SLBMs first, the Un
ited States will have adequate time to
launch its ICBMs. Thus, the argument
concludes, the United States could re
taliate against a Soviet first strike from
either land or sea.
Yet even in its own logic, the reason
ing is inconsistent, for the United
States could launch its ICBMs if the
Russians attacked either by land or sea.
The only thing gained by getting our
bombers airborne is an opportunity to
recall them, hence the "balanced nu
clear war." But we could gain similar
stability in refraining from launching
our own SLBMs in the six hours it
takes the B-l to reach Soviet airspace,
awaiting answer — I suppose — to an
ultimatum we would have transmitted
in that interval.
To assert that the B-l is the only al
ternative to launching our ICBMs is to
ignore the capability of our competent
SLBM force.
Compromise
In the spirit of compromise, for those
who maintain that America needs
bombers, granting that the B-52 can't
last forever, I still believe that there is a
satisfactory alternative to the B-l.
Were we to equip a fleet of modified
747s with cruise missiles the United
States would save two-thirds the cost
of the B-l on each plane, with the ad
vantage of greater penetrability of
Soviet airspace. Scrap the Trident
submarine. The Trident's attraction
stems from the fact that its missiles
have longer ranges than those the cur
rent Poseidon fleet is equipped with
and that it is a quieter vessel.
In response to the latter assertion, I

suggest that quietness is not necessar
ily an important factor in submarine
detection in a nuclear war.
Andtothefirst:theTrident 1 missile
was designed with the option of re
trofitting it into the existing 31
Poseidon submarines in mind.
Weapons systems like the Trident
submarine and the B-l bomber come
into being when there is inadequate
competition in the early stages of their
development and when vested in
terests — contractors and constituen
cies — gain control over their destiny.
Curb forces
3.) Reduce troop commitments out
side NATO. The United States stations
66,000 troops in South Korea. Consid
ering the inhumanity of the Park re
gime and the fact that South Korea has
the world's fifth largest army, the need
for American servicemen there is
dubious at best.
In addition to curbing our forces in
Thailand and the Philipines, the Un
ited States should also reevaluate its
presence in Japan. Given the recent de
tente with the Chinese, the 52,000 men
stationed there seem to serve in a
Teddy-bear capacity at best, especially
when one takes into account that Ja
pan's defense depends primarily on
the American nuclear deterrent.
Trim costs
4.) Trim pensions and manpower
costs. This is where the big saving in
the defense budget has to come. Over
half of the defense tax dollar goes into
this area and Rep. Les Aspin predicts
that pensions alone will syphon $34
billion off the budget by the end of this
century.
Carter has a real opportunity to slash
a few billion dollars in manpower
costs, provided he gets tough with
government unions and the Defense
Department.
We can no longer sacrifice social
programs to unnecessary defense ex
penditures. National security depends
equally upon political, social and
economic stability as it does on mili
tary posture.
The United States will achieve rela
tive safety in the next decade only if it
can determine with the Soviet Union
which weapons constitute deterrents
and which constitute threats.
An old axiom used to hold that in an
arms race, a nation had to spend in
order to keep from falling behind. In a
world that depends upon arms control,
I would alter that statement to read:
this nation must curb its spending or
lose its peace.

I voted for Jimmy Carter largely on
the strength of his promise to cut de
fense spending by $5 to $7 billion. I am
therefore perplexed by the president's
apparent reluctance to follow through
on this commitment, despite Defense
Secretary Harold Brown's indication
that he will attempt to trim that
amount from the defense budget he
prepares for fiscal 1978. Furthermore,
the new administration is redefining
what is meant by a $5 to $7 billion
reduction, defining it as savings in ef
ficiency and not as an overall cut.
This ambiguous stance reflects the
current debate inside the Pentagon on
whether to escalate the arms race to
match the recent Soviet build-up or to
