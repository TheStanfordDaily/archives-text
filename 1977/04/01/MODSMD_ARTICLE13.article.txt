# In California Senate
## Death measure gets okay 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — A bill restoring California's death
penalty won state Senate approval with ease yesterday after
a long and emotional debate.
The 29-10 vote — two more than the two-thirds majority
needed — sent the measure to the Assembly, where its
author agreed it faced tougher going.
"I think it will be more difficult," Sen. George Deukme
jian (R-Long Beach), said after the Senate vote.
1 he bill was introduced after the state Supreme Court
ruled last December that California's three-year-old death
penalty law did not meet U.S. Supreme Court guidelines.
Proposals of new law
I he proposed new law would allow capital punishment
tor 16 crimes, including treason, murder for hire, multiple
murder, torture murder, killing a police officer and murder
committed during several other crimes.
But unlike the old law, a jury could sentence a defendant
to life in prison without possibility of parole instead of
death if it decided that mitigating circumstances, such as a
defendant's age, warranted it.
The bill needed a two-thirds vote because backers in
serted a clause to impose it immediately upon enactment
instead of Jan. 2.
A two-thirds majority will also be needed in both houses
to override Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s promised veto.
But Deukmejian said that the 29-10 vote was noassurance

that the Senate would override Brown, who says he opposes
capital punishment as a "matter of conscience."
Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, said Tuesday that the
Democratic governor would lobby against an override, but
he added that most legislators probably had made up their
minds on the issue.
In the nearly two hour debate, bill supporters contended
that capital punishment would deter potential murderers,
while critics said there were studies that showed it did not
affect murder rates.
Sacks of pro petitions
At one point, Sen. H.L. Richardson (R-Arcadia), piled
three sacks full of petitions from death penalty supporters
on top of his desk and quoted a biblical passage calling fora
death penalty for murder.
Sen. John Briggs (R-Fullerton), said he was thinking of
voting against an override to encourage the possibility that
a death penalty initiative would be on the ballot in 1978,
when Brown comes up for re-election.
"1 think we ought to send him out naked in November
without death penalty and let the people throw him out,"
said Briggs, who said there was "an army of murderers
advancing on society."
Bill critics said it could result in innocent persons being
executed and encourage more violence. They said it would
be better to enact a life without parole measure.

while critics said there were studies that showed it did not
affect murder rates.
Sacks of pro petitions
At one point, Sen. H.L. Richardson (R-Arcadia), piled
three sacks full of petitions from death penalty supporters
on top of his desk and quoted a biblical passage calling fora
death penalty for murder.
Sen. John Briggs (R-Fullerton), said he was thinking of
voting against an override to encourage the possibility that
a death penalty initiative would be on the ballot in 1978,
when Brown comes up for re-election.
"1 think we ought to send him out naked in November
without death penalty and let the people throw him out,"
said Briggs, who said there was "an army of murderers
advancing on society."
Bill critics said it could result in innocent persons being
executed and encourage more violence. They said it would
be better to enact a life without parole measure.

Sacramento (AP) — A bill restoring California's death
penalty won state Senate approval with ease yesterday after
a long and emotional debate.
The 29-10 vote — two more than the two-thirds majority
needed — sent the measure to the Assembly, where its
author agreed it faced tougher going.
"I think it will be more difficult," Sen. George Deukme
jian (R-Long Beach), said after the Senate vote.
1 he bill was introduced after the state Supreme Court
ruled last December that California's three-year-old death
penalty law did not meet U.S. Supreme Court guidelines.
Proposals of new law
I he proposed new law would allow capital punishment
tor 16 crimes, including treason, murder for hire, multiple
murder, torture murder, killing a police officer and murder
committed during several other crimes.
But unlike the old law, a jury could sentence a defendant
to life in prison without possibility of parole instead of
death if it decided that mitigating circumstances, such as a
defendant's age, warranted it.
The bill needed a two-thirds vote because backers in
serted a clause to impose it immediately upon enactment
instead of Jan. 2.
A two-thirds majority will also be needed in both houses
to override Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s promised veto.
But Deukmejian said that the 29-10 vote was noassurance

that the Senate would override Brown, who says he opposes
capital punishment as a "matter of conscience."
Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, said Tuesday that the
Democratic governor would lobby against an override, but
he added that most legislators probably had made up their
minds on the issue.
In the nearly two hour debate, bill supporters contended
that capital punishment would deter potential murderers,
while critics said there were studies that showed it did not
affect murder rates.
