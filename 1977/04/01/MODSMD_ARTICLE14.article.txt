### Bonny Rodden Kurt Cobb 
alo Alto city attorney said she
Pans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to
aeurie the constitutionality of a 1971
• st ■<"( nof the Daily offices by four Palo
Alto policemen.
, ' ',' e searc h was ruled in violation of
( irst and Fourth Amendments by
the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appe
a s last month. On Monday, that court
voted not to rehear the case.
U e do plan to petition for certiorari
to the U.S. Supreme Court," said Mari
lyn laketa, assistant Palo Alto city at
torney.
frankly I don't think the court will
take the case, said Jermone Falk Jr.,
who argued the Daily's case before the
appeals court.
l alk noted that the federal district
court had also ruled the search uncon
stitutional, and said if the Supreme
Court does hear the case, it will not be
until October.
'Least drastic'
I he 1972 district court decision by
Judge Robert Peckham said police
should employ the "least drastic
means' available when seeking evi
dence from nonsuspects.
I he police obtained a search war
rant which gave the Daily no advance
warning, rather than a subpoena — a
less drastic option which the Daily
could have attempted to quash.
T he case, Stanford Daily v. Zurcher,
results from a raid of the Daily offices
by Palo Alto Police on April 12, 1971.
Equipped with a search warrant,
police ransacked files, desks and was
tebaskets looking for photographic
evidence to use against participants in
an April 9,1971 riot at Stanford hospi
tal.
I wenty-three persons were arrested
and at least 37 persons were injured
when police ended a sit-in at the hos
pital. The sit-in was in protest of the
firing of a hospital worker.
First known time
It was the first known time in U.S.
history police used a warrant to search
a news organization for evidence, ac
cording to Falk.
Since the Daily raid, Berkeley radio
station KPFA-FM, Los Angeles station
K.PFK-FM and San Francisco station
KPOO have experienced similar raids.
A search also occurred at the Los
Angeles Star and at least two search
warrants have been issued against the
Berkeley Barb.

Daily attorneys have been working
without pay for most of the six year
litigation. Peckham awarded $47,500
for attorneys fees but a 1974 Supreme
Court decision invalidated the award.
Subsequent to the Supreme Court's
decision Congress passed a law allow
ing attorney's fees to be awarded in
civil rights cases. The appeals court
then reinstated Peckham's award.
The judge
Peckham's opinion, adopted in its
entirety by the Circuit Court, the judge
said the search violated Fourth
Amendment protection against "un
reasonable searches and seizures." He
warned law enforcement agencies to
be especially careful when First
Amendment interests are involved.

In such cases, he said, "the sub
poena should always be preferred to a
search warrant.
A search warrant should be permit
ted only in the rare circumstances
where there is a clear showing that 1)
important materials will be destroyed
or removed from the jurisdiction; and
2) a restraining order would be futile.
To stop short of this standard would be
to sneer at all the First Amendment has
come to represent in our society."
Attorney Taketa said yesterday she
had yet to petition the Supreme Court
to hear the case. Defendants can file
with the court until 90 days alter the
appeals court's decision not to rehear
and the Daily can file in opposition up
to 30 days after defendants file, accord
ing to Falk.
