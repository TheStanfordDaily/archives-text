# Room, board rate to increase 7 per cent
## 
### Thatcher Freund 
Room and board rates will increase
approximately seven per cent next
year according to Edward Scoles, di
rector of University housing and food
services.
The "total increase," said Scoles,
will reflect an increase of "about eight
per cent in housing and six per cent in
board." Room and board fees totaled
$1841 this year and will be $1970 for
academic year 1977-78.
Most seriously affected by the in
creases wi 11 be the co-op houses. Room
fees for the co-ops will be increased
"more than 10 per cent," said Scoles. A
publication fully explaining the in
creases will be published soon, Scoles
said.
Norm Robinson, acting associate
dean of student affairs, said he didn't
think the increase would affect the va
cancy rate of on-campus student hous
ing, including the co-ops.
According to Scoles, the "overall
vacancy factor," or rough estimation of
vacancies in Stanford housing, usually
runs about two per cent. Fall and
winter quarters normally have vac
ancy factors of zero to one per cent
with spring quarter running higher at
around five per cent.
Manzanita Park, the perennial
leader of the vacancy "pack," accounts

for a large percentage of the total vac
ancies. According to Philip Curry,
management analyst for student af
fairs, Manzanita showed a vacancy
rate of 12.4 per cent as of yesterday.
Curry emphasized that the number
of vacancies in Manzanita (57 out of
460 spaces) is "still fluctuating." Still,
Curry said his office could see no
"clear cut, noticeable, or important
change" from the vacancy number last
year.
The room rents at Manzanita were
cut five per cent from last year "to be
exactly the same as the dorm" rates,
Scoles said.
The Office of Residential Education
"hasn't really done any analysis" on
the effects of the guaranteed housing
system or the rate drop at Manzanita,
said Curry.
"We're not all that confident that
lowering (Manzanita rates further)
would fill the trailers," said Scoles,
adding that "merchandising is only
going to work so far."
Scoles said he thinks the relatively
new guaranteed housing system "has
caused a few vacancies." He said
"people tend to make permanent plans
around their non-guaranteed year.
They're not coming on (campus) any
more as vacancies open."
