# By student defender
## SJC reforms advocated 
### Mike Charlson 
Defendants before the Stanford Jud
icial Council (SJC) "have been screwed
to the wall" in the past, according to
Robin Hamill, student defender coor
dinator for the SJC.
Things are better this year, she said,
but further changes are needed to
make the system fairer.
Her ideas will include pay for de
fense "lawyers," year-long appoint
ment of defenders and appointment of
a person to advise the defense counsel
when she submits recommendations
for change to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons "within the next few
weeks."
The SJC hears many cases involving
alleged violations of the Honor Code,
Fundamental Standard or the Univer
sity Policy on Campus Disruption. The
counsel makes recommendations for
punishments to President Richard
Lyman, according to James Siena,
legal adviser to the president.
Better treatment
This year a student charged with a
violation involving an SJC hearing can
expect better treatment than in the
past, Hamill said.
Previously, there was no coordina
tion of activities'in a student's defense.
This is in sharp contrast to highly or
ganized prosecutions put together by
Siena and student assistants he has
chosen.
Both prosecution and defense
lawyers are students in the law school.
The prosecutors are paid $5 per hour
and are appointed for one year while
defenders were appointed to hear only
one case each year without pay. This
year, defenders are better equipped
because Hamill acts as a coordinator of
all defense lawyers so they can be
briefed on SJC procedures. She advises
on every case.
Still unpaid
Yet the defenders are still unpaid
and still only work on one case. And
experience is a big edge, Hamill said.
"Having a couple of cases under
your belt gives you the edge you
need," Hamill said. After working on
nine different cases, she said she is
more confident and more capable of
formulating a defense strategy.
In addition, she said she is more ef
fective because of the relationship she
has built with persons at the Univer
sity involved in the judicial process.
"This year (the defense lawyers)
made up in time what they lacked in
experience," Hamill said.

She pointed to the relatively light
sentence of a work fine imposed on
three first-time violators of the Honor
Code last quarter. One-quarter suspen
sion is the usual first time offense sen
tence in honor code cases, but the de
fense successfully argued the cir
cumstances behind the case to get the
lighter penalty.
In the past, because of inadequate
defense, "the students would have
been suspended," Hamill said.
Several cases
Assoc. Political Science Prof, and
SJC Chairman Jonathan Casper agreed
saying, "We've had several cases this
year, and the defense attorneys have
been terrific."
Hamill stressed that she felt the jud
icial system was an excellent one over
all. "But improvements can always be
made."
Lyons, when he asked Hamill to
coordinate defense activities last fall,
also asked her to draft some recom
mendations for positive changes. "Ro
bin's ideas will be considered very
seriously," Lyons said.
Hamill said she will also recom
mend that the University appoint a
counterpart to Siena for the defense.
Under the present system, Siena is the
person with whom a complaint about a
student is filed. Depending on the evi
dence, he decides whether to file
charges, and he then directs the stu
dent prosecutors.
Says nothing
Siena says nothing during the pro
ceedings, Hamill noted, but he does
write advisory messages to the pro
secutors, she said.
"There is also a question of author
ity," she added. "When I'm sitting at
one end of a table with a student de
fender and Jim Siena, the legal advisor
to the president of the University, is
sitting at the other end of the table,
who has the authority?"
But Casper said the defense can
utilize Law Schocl Dean of Admis
sions William Keogh as an advisor.
Hamill confirmed tJiis, but said he is
such a busy man fh&. defense feels "re
ally bad" about bothering him. She
advocated a person with law experi
ence who, as part of his normal job
duties, advises the defense in SJC hear
ings.
Saying shefelt people involved with
administration of justice are "super
and full of integrity," Hamill also
suggested some changes be made so
student justice will "depend on the

mechanisms of the system instead of
the individuals."
"What happens if Jim Lyons is run
over by a truck tomorrow? How will
the next case go?" she asked calling
Lyons a "very fair and good person."
Last quarter, a case involving two
counts of Honor Code violation and
two counts of Fundamental Standard
violations resulted in expulsion for a
student, according to transcripts of SJC
preceedings prepared by Westerlind.
Names of all involved in the case were
removed from the transcript to insure
confidentiality.
Students with a violation have
another option beside the SJC, if they
are willing to plead guilty. A request
may be filed with Lyons asking him to
hear the case, a popular alternative,
Lyons said.
"Students generally want the dean
to hear the case because they don't
want other people to know," Lyons
said. He added that though SJC mem
bers are bound by the same rules of
confidentiality, the fact that only one
person will hear the case instead of six
puts a student more at ease.
Personal treatment
He added that students often feel
they will get more personal treatment
from him.
Lyons said his caseload has dropped
recently for two reasons. He said some
concern was expressed by the SJC that
the primary system of justice (the SJC)
was becoming the alternative while
the alternative was becoming the main
system.
Moreover, Lyons said he will not
rule on a case where no punishment
precedent has been set. The cases he
has refused to hear recently, he said,
fell into this category.
Lyons said after a student has been
punished, the entire affair is com
pletely confidential.
'Corrigibility'
"Thereis a fundamental principle of
corrigibility here," he said.
Siena said he was thinking about a
change in the disparity of compensa
tion between defense and prosecution
attorneys but was unavailable to com
ment on Hamill's other recommenda
tions.
Both Lyons and Casper said they
would have to see the actual recom
mendations before they could com
ment on them.
All, however, emphasized that they
were anxious to hear Hamill's sugges
tions.
