# After expansion
## Bookstore: 'one of the best' 
### Wil Nixon 
When construction of the Stanford Bookstore addition
is completed next February, the bookstore will become
"one of the finest college bookstores in the country,"
said bookstore manager Eldon Speed.
The addition "couldn't come any later than its com
ing," added Speed. He compared the present bookstore
to a family living in an apartment who really needed to
move into a house.
When completed, the addition will house textbooks
and stationary supplies, and provide warehouse space in
an 18-foot-high basement. The bookkeeper's and man
ager's office will both be in the addition as well.
The new warehouse space and bookkeeper's office
will save the bookstore $30,000 a year now paid to rent
storage and office space in Palo Alto, according to Speed.
The Howard J. White firm in Palo Alto began building
the addition March 19 and is scheduled to finish by
February 12 next year according to Carroll Rankin,
senior planner at the planning office.
Under a separate contract, White excavated the area
behind the bookstore and underpinned the columns
supporting the rear wall of the present bookstore. The
firm won the new contract with a low bid of $1,766,960
— almost $170,000 below the ceiling approved for build
ing by the University Board of Trustees.
The bookstore will also install double the present
number of cash registers, Speed said, to ease the book
buying rush at the beginning of each quarter.
This year the bookstore speeded up lines by placing
adding machines in front of the cash registers to tabulate
a customer's book prices before the customer reached the
register.

The new cash registers will be placed wheiie the ad
ding machines have been so two customers from each
line can pay at once. These new registers will not be
permanent, but will be brought out during rush periods,
said Speed.
"The bulk of the new area will be an expansion of what
we already have," said Speed. The first floor of the pre
sent bookstore will be devoted entirely to general books
including paperbacks. Speed said the first floor will then
compare to a good bookstore in Palo Alto.
Other items now sold on the first floor such as statio
nary, records and T-shirts and shorts will move to the
first floor of the addition.
Speed said the bookstore hoped to expand its selection
in areas such as photography and records. He said he
wanted this section of the new store to become a "total
stationer."
The mezzanine will also hold general books for brows
ing, and chairs will be added at the post office side of the
mezzanine to make browsing more enjoyable than in the
present crowded bookstore, according to Speed.
All text books will be displayed in the second floor of
the addition. The back wall of the present bookstore has
already been taken down and temporarily replaced with
plywood, according to Senior Planner Rankin. She said
the plywood will later be removed so the addition will
connect with the present bookstore.
Theaddition will be paid for entirely by the bookstore,
a nonprofit organization. The University has loaned $2
million to the bookstore, said Speed, to be paid back over
a 30 year period. The remaining costs of almost $1 mill
ion have already been met by the bookstore.
