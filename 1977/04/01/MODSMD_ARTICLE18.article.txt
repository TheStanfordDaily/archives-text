# College Title IX action skimpy
## 
### 
(CHS) â€” Less than half of the school districts and
colleges which are obliged to meet requirements
preventing sex discrimination under Title IX of the
1972 Education Amendments have submitted the
necessary assurance statements, says the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Welfare's Office of
Civil Rights (OCR). There are 20.31H institutions
that must file compliance forms and by March 17
only 6742 had submitted acceptable statements.
Joseph Califano, HEW secretary, has instituted a
"get tough" policy which will give the school sys
tems and colleges that did not file assurance forms
or filed unacceptable reports 60 days to assure the
government they are complying with the regula
tion or face possible withdrawal of federal funds.
An OCR spokesman said, however, that it takes
about nine months to process a cutoff ol funds from
the federal government, so it is not likely that any
denial of money would take effect during the cur
rent school year.
Higher Education Daily, an independent news
service for higher education administrators, re
ported that a total of 3222 school districts and
colleges sent in unacceptable statements while
10,354 failed to submit any statements at all.
All schools receiving federal aid are required to
enter compliance forms to 11EW and were notified

in July 1976 that the forms were to have been
submitted originally by next Sept. 30. Since
Califano's "get tough" announcement in l'ebruary,
the agency has been receiving about six forms a
day.
the 3222 unacceptable forms submitted failed
to establish grievance procedures, appoint an
equal opportunity officer or conduct a self
evaluation of programs and policies that might
violate the legal requirements of Title IX.
In a further attempt to deal with the high level of
poor or nonexistent response to the Title IX regula
tions, the CXIR has revised the Title IX compliance
form which will be mailed to schools and colleges
next month.
The new form resembles the former compliance
sheet in every way except for the elimination of a
section that required recipients of federal aid to get
written assurances of compliance with Title IX
from subgrantees, contractors or subcontractors.
Instead, says HEW, the federal aid recipients can
check up those employes on their own.
Title IX provides that "no person shall, on the
basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimi
nation under any education program or activity
receiving Federal financial assistance."
