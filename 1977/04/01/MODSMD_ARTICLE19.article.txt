Laguna Hills (AP) — At least
100 persons failed to escape
death in the world's worst air
disaster because they sat im
mobilized by fear after two
jumbo jets collided in the Canary
Islands, a survivor said yester
day.
Floy Heck, 70, said she too had
been frozen in terror but sur
vived because her husband,
Paul, made her get out through
an emergency exit and jump 20
feet off the wing of a Pan Ameri
can World Airways 747 mo
ments before it exploded in
flames.
As they climbed out, she said,
she saw about 100 other passen
gers still in their seats, appa
rently immobilized by fear or
shock.
"They just didn't move. On
their side of the plane, the whole
wall was blown away," she said
in an interview. "1 believe at
least another 100 could have
been saved but they were sitting
there just transfixed."
"It was like the Hindenburg
blowing up," said Heck of the
Leisure World retirement com
munity here. "It was a terrible
sight. I said, 'Jesus, help me, help
me!' and he did."

More than 570 persons died in
the collision of the Pan Am and
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
jumbo jets at Tenerife Airport.
The May 1937 crash of the
German zeppelin Hindenburg
killed 36 persons, several of
them leaping from the blimp's
gondola to the landing pad at
Lakehurst, N.J.
Heck said she injured her
ankle in the leap from the 747
wing and had to crawl to safety
Sunday.
Released Wednesday night
from University of California, Ir
vine, Medical Center, Heck said
she and her husband, who re
mains hospitalized with burns,
had waited four hours at
Tenerife before their plane was
allowed to move on the runway.
"The plane was making a turn
in that terrible fog. Suddenly
there was the most horrendous
noise and terrific crash," she
said. "Someone yelled out that
we had been bombed. There
were splinters of wood, metal
and debris and also fire. The ceil
ing was falling down on us. I
thought for certain that this was
the end."
Another survivor, John
Combs, 64, of Hawaii, said: "I

felt like a wienie being basted
with a piece of bacon in an oven.
I thought it was all over. The cap
tains were yelling at us to get
away. The plane was going to go
but I couldn't leave my baby of
39 years, really. I simply had to
go back and find her."
A farmer helped him find his
wife, Louise, 59, and pull her out
of the wreckage, he said. Combs,
staying at Newport Beach, was
released from UC-Irvine Medical
Center on Wednesday but his
wife remained hospitalized with
a broken back and burns on her
hands and knees.
Also among those admitted at
the medical center were Stephen
and Ruth Culbertson of Green
Valley, Ariz.
Culbertson was in fair condi
tion with third-degree burns on
his abdomen, arms, hands and
face, while his wife was in good
condition with second-degree
burns on her face, abdomen,
arms, right thigh and lacerations
on her forehead, hospital
spokesmen said yesterday.
They were among two dozen
of the survivors who arrived at El
Toro Marine Base on Wednesday
and were transferred to various
hospitals or sent home.
