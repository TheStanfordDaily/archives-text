# USE found investing in J.P. Stevens
## 
### Jacob Young 
Nearly 30 per cent of the $2 million
United Stanford Employees union
(USE) pension fund is invested in
stock from the J.P. Stevens Company, a
former USE official confirmed yester
day.
J.P. Stevens, a textile manufacturing
company centered in Roanoke Rapids,
Va., has been subject to substantial na
tional criticism lately because of al
leged violations of National Labor Re
lations Board (NLRB) regulations. Ste
vens has also been charged with
obstructing the efforts of the Amalga
mated Clothing and Textile Workers
Union (ACTUW) to organize Stevens
employes.
Protest arose in the University
community because Stanford holds
some 3000 shares of Stevens stock.
That protest culminated in a sit-in last
month in which some 50 community
members occupied Encina Hall urging
the University to "act in a moral way"
when casting votes on two controver
sial stockholders proposals.
Those proposals, if approved, would
force the company to divulge labor
practices.
When questioned about the union
holdings in Stevens stock, USE
spokesperson Jim Berk said he had no
comment and "this is entirely an in
ternal union affair and does not con
cern the student body or the Daily."
The Daily learned about the union
holdings through a letter from the Ste
vens company passed to a reporter by a
member of the University administra
tion
When contacted about the disclo
sure, Stanford Committee for Justice at
J.P. Stevens organizer Peter Necar
sulmer said he was "truly shocked. I
can't imagine why a union would so
flagrantly violate the sanctity of the
tradition of national union solidarity.
The union here really has no choice
but to divest itself of the Stevens stock.
It's a travesty."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said this disclosure
will "substantially weaken the posi
tion in which the union will find itself
next time contracts are to be
negotiated."
USE refused throughout the week to
comment officially on the holdings,
echoing Berk's earlier statements.
However, the Daily sent several report
ers to the Plant Services headquarters
on Pampas Lane to talk with union
members.
One worker, a former union official,
who wished to remain anonymous,
said he will attempt to set up a study
group of workers to bring this matter
into "the public view, where the voic
es of the workers can be heard.
Contacted at the Virginia plant, a
spokesman for Stevens said, "It is im
portant that the community be in
formed about the holdings. We don't
feel that we should be subject to flack
from Stanford when your own union
apparently supports us."
The union has been buying the stock
for about three years. When the Daily
checked public records of USE in
vestments, it appears that USE has
purchased nearly $50,000 of the Ste
vens stock in the past month, appar
ently after attention was drawn to the
company's alleged violations.
Company officials said that "it looks
like they (USE) must have a good fi
nancial manager. Our stock has been
doing quite well recently."
USE refused to reveal the name of its
financial manager.

company centered in Roanoke Rapids,
Va., has been subject to substantial na
tional criticism lately because of al
leged violations of National Labor Re
lations Board (NLRB) regulations. Ste
vens has also been charged with
obstructing the efforts of the Amalga
mated Clothing and Textile Workers
Union (ACTUW) to organize Stevens
employes.
Protest arose in the University
community because Stanford holds
some 3000 shares of Stevens stock.
That protest culminated in a sit-in last
month in which some 50 community
members occupied Encina Hall urging
the University to "act in a moral way"
when casting votes on two controver
sial stockholders proposals.
Those proposals, if approved, would
force the company to divulge labor
practices.
When questioned about the union
holdings in Stevens stock, USE
spokesperson Jim Berk said he had no
comment and "this is entirely an in
ternal union affair and does not con
cern the student body or the Daily."
The Daily learned about the union
holdings through a letter from the Ste
vens company passed to a reporter by a
member of the University administra
tion
When contacted about the disclo
sure, Stanford Committee for Justice at
J.P. Stevens organizer Peter Necar
sulmer said he was "truly shocked. I
can't imagine why a union would so
flagrantly violate the sanctity of the
tradition of national union solidarity.
The union here really has no choice
but to divest itself of the Stevens stock.
It's a travesty."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said this disclosure
will "substantially weaken the posi
tion in which the union will find itself
next time contracts are to be
negotiated."
USE refused throughout the week to
comment officially on the holdings,
echoing Berk's earlier statements.
However, the Daily sent several report
ers to the Plant Services headquarters
on Pampas Lane to talk with union
members.
One worker, a former union official,
who wished to remain anonymous,
said he will attempt to set up a study
group of workers to bring this matter
into "the public view, where the voic
es of the workers can be heard.
Contacted at the Virginia plant, a
spokesman for Stevens said, "It is im
portant that the community be in
formed about the holdings. We don't
feel that we should be subject to flack
from Stanford when your own union
apparently supports us."
The union has been buying the stock
for about three years. When the Daily
checked public records of USE in
vestments, it appears that USE has
purchased nearly $50,000 of the Ste
vens stock in the past month, appar
ently after attention was drawn to the
company's alleged violations.
Company officials said that "it looks
like they (USE) must have a good fi
nancial manager. Our stock has been
doing quite well recently."
USE refused to reveal the name of its
financial manager.
Nearly 30 per cent of the $2 million
United Stanford Employees union
(USE) pension fund is invested in
stock from the J.P. Stevens Company, a
former USE official confirmed yester
day.
