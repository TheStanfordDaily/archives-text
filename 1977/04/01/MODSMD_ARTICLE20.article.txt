(CPS) "It's been common
knowledge that you could pay to
get into medical school for years.
There have been payoffs to all
types of professional schools;
medical, veterinary, dental, law.
It's nationwide," says FBI agent
Jim Perry.
Common knowledge and
common ripoff but the deals are
made with anyone but the com
mon person. Many students who
have the way to graduate school
bought and paid for come from
families where fathers are politi
cians, businessmen or wealthy
doctors in the community. And
Perry is working on one case in
Philadelphia where daddy hap
pened to know a State Represen
tative.
Herbert Fineman, Democratic
Speaker of the Pennsylvania
House of Representatives, was
indicted last month on charges
of blackmail, bribery, obstruc
tion of justice, mail fraud and
conspiracy in connection with

alleged payoffs by three parents
who sought admission for their
children to the University of
Pennsylvania School of Veteri
nary Medicine, Thomas Jeffer
son University and the Philadel
phia School of Osteopathic
Medicine.
Fineman, 56, allegedly ex
torted $41,000 from 1968 to 1976
from the parents. Named as co
conspirator was Martin Abrams
who reportedly collected the
payoffs but was not indicted.
Fineman's identity was never
revealed to the parents.
Fineman is the fourth
Philadelphian politician to be
indicted for soliciting bribes to
influence professional school
admission. David W. Marston,
U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia,
said the indictments resulted
from a "monster investigation
over six months long." The FBI
entered the Fineman case on a
lead from a confidential FBI
source, according to Perry.

Based on the indictment,
Fineman took $15,000 through
Abrams from Oscar Braunstein,
one of the parents, in 1972. On
April 5, 1973, Fineman sent an
undisclosed letter to Mark Al
lam, who was then dean of the
Veterinary School. He soon re
ceived the payoff money from
Abrams a month later and
Braunstein's son, Michael, was
admitted to the school.
Later, on August 31, 1976,
the indictment charges
that Fineman met with Senior
Vice-President for one of the
University's programs E. Craig
Sweeten and ordered him to de
stroy all correspondence relat
ing to Braunstein's admission
located in the student's files. As
yet, no school administrators in
volved or parents have been in
dicted.
