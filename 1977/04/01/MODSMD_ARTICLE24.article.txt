# Prose less political but advice on rise
## 
### Sue Lesjak Mike Charison 
In the mood for a debate about
gay rights?
How about a quick bit of
philosophical repartee?
A basic anatomy lesson
perhaps?
Advice on your love life?
Or maybe just some nice, dirty
ivords!
This and much, much more
can be found amid the works of
graffitists who scratch their wis
dom in the stalls of bathrooms
around campus.
Of course, it depends on
which sex you are as to the type
of graffiti you are likely to run
into. While women on campus
are now specializing in advice
on love life and lesbian discus
sions,the intellectual quality of
graffiti in their bathrooms is
generally higher than that found
in the men's stalls.
Gone are the days when bath
rooms were besmattered with
political and philosophical tid
bits such as "God is dead —
Nietsche, Nietsche is dead —
God." "Nixon's father should
have withdrawn 65 years ago."
or "When the last American
leaves Vietnam, please turn out
the light at the end of the tun
nel."
Deep thoughts
Oh, yes, occasionally there are
still deep thoughts like, "Reality
is just a crutch for people who

can't handle drugs," but by and
large the quality is down.
While Nixon and Watergate
dominated political etchings of
years past, the best politics today
seems to be the on-going debate
concerning whether homosexu
als should be given equal rights

GRzff.tf

or should be castrated

Writing about lesbianism runs
rampant in the women's
facilities, especially in Meyer
Library. "Being a lesbian is the
most beautiful, fulfilling, sup
portive, positive, wonderful part
of my life," writes one woman.
"Sisters, when will you tap into
the joys and splendors of loving
your own and others' woman
selves?" To this, one "sister" re
torted, "So make a movie about
it, why don't you?"
Homosexuality in the male
bathrooms, while equally preva
lent, takes on quite a different
form. Words, often etched into
toilet paper dispensers involve
offers of sexual favors and the
leaving of telephone numbers.

According to Psychiatry Pro
fessor Donald Lunde, this is not
entirely surprising since bath
rooms are a common meeting
place for what he termed "prom
iscuous homosexuals." "My
guess is that some of the offers

are probably someone's joke, but
some may be real."
Serious debates
At times, the homosexual
proclamations turn into serious
debates as conflicting view
points are espoused. While a
few, as mentioned earlier, advo
cate the castration of all gays,
other writings plead for equality
and compassion.
But debate on the question is
not restricted to the men's room.
In response to one lesbian com
ment, "Adam was just a rough
draft," a person, signing as "a
Christian," wrote, "Well ladies,
I've had enough of this lesbian
trash.
"God made man for woman
and woman for man. Lesbianism
is perverted. You need God's

help to drive those devilish
ideas out ot your heads."
Graffiti in the male facilities is
generally baser than that in the
females', the Daily
survey re
vealed. Walls itre often deco
rated with crude art" depicting
sexual themes. And drawings
are often accompanies by artistic

opinions. One critic in a wo
man's stall wrote, "This is a
crude drawing. Can't you do
any better?" only to have the ar
tist reply, "No, if you ain't never
seen a real one.
Campus commentaries are not
unheard of either. For example,
on one wall was an organic
chemistry quiz showing a chem
ical structure. Students were
asked to guess which of seven
illicit substances the structure
represented.
Men also write complaints
about female students. One stu
dent wrote, "A Stanford woman
is just a guy who studied his
balls off in high school."
But the subjects of graffiti
need not be farcical, sexual or

funny. Some of the inscriptions,
especially in the women's bat
hrooms, are serious. Advice is
often solicited and given.
One girl wrote, "I have an ob
session with eating. 1 constantly
go on binges. Anybody else

overcome this problem?" A
helpful psychoanalyst replied,
"I believe you're not satisfying
yourself in other aspects of your
life, such as sex."
At times, the walls become
another Barlett's with quotes
from great minds and writers of
history.
Advice on women's love lives
is also widespread.
Sexual mores are analyzed as
well. One woman asking "What
do you think about being en
gaged to one man, but in the
meantime casually sleeping
around?" found two responses.
"Stop worrying. He's probably

sleeping with other women,"
said one amatuer Dear Abby
while the Ann Landers of the
lavatories offered, "I think
you're tragically male
identified; women should put
their energy into loving wo
men."

True confessions
And then there are the true
confessions. One upset coed
wrote, "I've never said the word
'penis' aloud. What's wrong
with me?"
Ironically, though, it is the
men's room which is generally
more liberally doused with graf
fiti. Lunde said there are many
theories as to why. Robert Ardry,
in his book Territorial Impera
tive, mentions the need for males
to "identify themselves territo
rially," according to Lunde.
He also said graffiti seems to
have roots in antiquity, with ar
chaeologists finding evidence of
Latin and Egyptian equivalents
of "Joe is an asshole" from an
cient times. He said sex and per
sonal insults were most often

subject matter then as now.
Graffiti is a constant problem
for the custodial crews on cam
pus, but Bruce Wiggins, opera
tions manager at plant services,
said cleaning graffiti in rest
rooms is not part of the custo
dian's standard duties. While
lavatories are cleaned daily, he
said, removal of graffiti is done
only when his office receives a
request or a complaint.
When this happens a specific
work order is issued, and custo
dians attempt to clean the walls.
He said the tile walls and
enameled metal dividers bet
ween stalls in the newer build
ings makes this task easier.
Nonetheless, graffitists often
etch their words into the walls
with sharp objects. When too
much of this sort of graffiti
builds up, Wiggins said, a crew
is sent out to repaint the facility.
This is also the procedure in
older buildings which have plas
ter walls.
Despite the intellectual de
cline in graffiti in general, how
ever, Stanford graffiti, like the
University itself, is rated above
par, signed "A IJSC coed."
She wrote, "I've never read
such commentaries before on a
public bathroom wall. Such a
social consciousness while re
lieving your bladder! It does im
press me. Perhaps I should trans
fer here so as to be able to get
more insight into the matter."

Graffiti in the male facilities is
generally baser than that in the
females', the Daily
survey re
vealed. Walls itre often deco
rated with crude art" depicting
sexual themes. And drawings
are often accompanies by artistic

opinions. One critic in a wo
man's stall wrote, "This is a
crude drawing. Can't you do
any better?" only to have the ar
tist reply, "No, if you ain't never
seen a real one.
Campus commentaries are not
unheard of either. For example,
on one wall was an organic
chemistry quiz showing a chem
ical structure. Students were
asked to guess which of seven
illicit substances the structure
represented.
Men also write complaints
about female students. One stu
dent wrote, "A Stanford woman
is just a guy who studied his
balls off in high school."
But the subjects of graffiti
need not be farcical, sexual or

funny. Some of the inscriptions,
especially in the women's bat
hrooms, are serious. Advice is
often solicited and given.
One girl wrote, "I have an ob
session with eating. 1 constantly
go on binges. Anybody else

overcome this problem?" A
helpful psychoanalyst replied,
"I believe you're not satisfying
yourself in other aspects of your
life, such as sex."
At times, the walls become
another Barlett's with quotes
from great minds and writers of
history.
Advice on women's love lives
is also widespread.
Sexual mores are analyzed as
well. One woman asking "What
do you think about being en

meantime casually sleeping
around?" found two responses.
"Stop worrying. He's probably

sleeping with other women,"
said one amatuer Dear Abby
while the Ann Landers of the
lavatories offered, "I think
you're tragically male
identified; women should put
their energy into loving wo
men."

True confessions
And then there are the true
confessions. One upset coed
wrote, "I've never said the word
'penis' aloud. What's wrong
with me?"
Ironically, though, it is the
men's room which is generally
more liberally doused with graf
fiti. Lunde said there are many
theories as to why. Robert Ardry,
in his book Territorial Impera
tive, mentions the need for males
to "identify themselves territo
rially," according to Lunde.
He also said graffiti seems to
have roots in antiquity, with ar
chaeologists finding evidence of
Latin and Egyptian equivalents
of "Joe is an asshole" from an
cient times. He said sex and per
sonal insults were most often

subject matter then as now.
Graffiti is a constant problem
for the custodial crews on cam
pus, but Bruce Wiggins, opera
tions manager at plant services,
said cleaning graffiti in rest
rooms is not part of the custo
dian's standard duties. While
lavatories are cleaned daily, he
said, removal of graffiti is done
only when his office receives a
request or a complaint.
When this happens a specific
work order is issued, and custo
dians attempt to clean the walls.
He said the tile walls and
enameled metal dividers bet
ween stalls in the newer build
ings makes this task easier.
Nonetheless, graffitists often
etch their words into the walls
with sharp objects. When too
much of this sort of graffiti
builds up, Wiggins said, a crew
is sent out to repaint the facility.
This is also the procedure in
older buildings which have plas
ter walls.

Advice on your love life?

This and much, much more
can be found amid the works of
graffitists who scratch their wis
dom in the stalls of bathrooms
around campus.
Of course, it depends on
which sex you are as to the type
of graffiti you are likely to run
into. While women on campus
are now specializing in advice
on love life and lesbian discus
sions,the intellectual quality of
graffiti in their bathrooms is
generally higher than that found
in the men's stalls.
Gone are the days when bath
rooms were besmattered with
political and philosophical tid
bits such as "God is dead —
Nietsche, Nietsche is dead —
God." "Nixon's father should
have withdrawn 65 years ago."
or "When the last American
leaves Vietnam, please turn out
the light at the end of the tun
nel."
Deep thoughts
Oh, yes, occasionally there are
still deep thoughts like, "Reality
is just a crutch for people who

can't handle drugs," but by and
large the quality is down.
While Nixon and Watergate
dominated political etchings of
years past, the best politics today
seems to be the on-going debate
concerning whether homosexu
als should be given equal rights

GRzff.tf

or should be castrated

Writing about lesbianism runs
rampant in the women's
facilities, especially in Meyer
Library. "Being a lesbian is the
most beautiful, fulfilling, sup
portive, positive, wonderful part
of my life," writes one woman.
"Sisters, when will you tap into
the joys and splendors of loving
your own and others' woman
selves?" To this, one "sister" re
torted, "So make a movie about
it, why don't you?"
Homosexuality in the male
bathrooms, while equally preva
lent, takes on quite a different
form. Words, often etched into
toilet paper dispensers involve
offers of sexual favors and the
leaving of telephone numbers.

According to Psychiatry Pro
fessor Donald Lunde, this is not
entirely surprising since bath
rooms are a common meeting
place for what he termed "prom
iscuous homosexuals." "My
guess is that some of the offers

are probably someone's joke, but
some may be real."
Serious debates
At times, the homosexual
proclamations turn into serious
debates as conflicting view
points are espoused. While a
few, as mentioned earlier, advo
cate the castration of all gays,
other writings plead for equality
and compassion.
But debate on the question is
not restricted to the men's room.
In response to one lesbian com
ment, "Adam was just a rough
draft," a person, signing as "a
Christian," wrote, "Well ladies,
I've had enough of this lesbian
trash.
"God made man for woman
and woman for man. Lesbianism

Advice on your love life?
Or maybe just some nice, dirty

This and much, much more
can be found amid the works of
graffitists who scratch their wis
dom in the stalls of bathrooms
around campus.
Of course, it depends on
which sex you are as to the type
of graffiti you are likely to run
into. While women on campus
are now specializing in advice
on love life and lesbian discus
sions,the intellectual quality of
graffiti in their bathrooms is
generally higher than that found
in the men's stalls.
Gone are the days when bath
rooms were besmattered with
political and philosophical tid
bits such as "God is dead —
Nietsche, Nietsche is dead —
God." "Nixon's father should
have withdrawn 65 years ago."
or "When the last American
leaves Vietnam, please turn out
the light at the end of the tun
nel."
Deep thoughts
Oh, yes, occasionally there are
still deep thoughts like, "Reality
is just a crutch for people who

can't handle drugs," but by and
large the quality is down.
While Nixon and Watergate
dominated political etchings of
years past, the best politics today
seems to be the on-going debate
concerning whether homosexu
als should be given equal rights

GRzff.tf

or should be castrated

Writing about lesbianism runs
rampant in the women's
facilities, especially in Meyer
Library. "Being a lesbian is the
most beautiful, fulfilling, sup
portive, positive, wonderful part
of my life," writes one woman.
"Sisters, when will you tap into
the joys and splendors of loving
your own and others' woman
selves?" To this, one "sister" re
torted, "So make a movie about
it, why don't you?"
Homosexuality in the male
bathrooms, while equally preva
lent, takes on quite a different
form. Words, often etched into
toilet paper dispensers involve
offers of sexual favors and the
leaving of telephone numbers.

According to Psychiatry Pro
fessor Donald Lunde, this is not
entirely surprising since bath
rooms are a common meeting
place for what he termed "prom
iscuous homosexuals." "My
guess is that some of the offers

are probably someone's joke, but
some may be real."
Serious debates
At times, the homosexual
proclamations turn into serious
debates as conflicting view
points are espoused. While a
few, as mentioned earlier, advo
cate the castration of all gays,
other writings plead for equality
and compassion.
But debate on the question is
not restricted to the men's room.
In response to one lesbian com
ment, "Adam was just a rough
draft," a person, signing as "a
Christian," wrote, "Well ladies,
I've had enough of this lesbian
trash.
"God made man for woman
and woman for man. Lesbianism
is perverted. You need God's

help to drive those devilish
ideas out ot your heads."
Graffiti in the male facilities is
generally baser than that in the
females', the Daily
survey re
vealed. Walls itre often deco
rated with crude art" depicting
sexual themes. And drawings
are often accompanies by artistic

opinions. One critic in a wo
man's stall wrote, "This is a
crude drawing. Can't you do
any better?" only to have the ar
tist reply, "No, if you ain't never
seen a real one.
Campus commentaries are not
unheard of either. For example,
on one wall was an organic
chemistry quiz showing a chem
ical structure. Students were
asked to guess which of seven
illicit substances the structure
represented.
Men also write complaints
about female students. One stu
dent wrote, "A Stanford woman
is just a guy who studied his
balls off in high school."
But the subjects of graffiti
need not be farcical, sexual or

funny. Some of the inscriptions,
especially in the women's bat
hrooms, are serious. Advice is
often solicited and given.
One girl wrote, "I have an ob
session with eating. 1 constantly
go on binges. Anybody else

overcome this problem?" A
helpful psychoanalyst replied,
"I believe you're not satisfying
yourself in other aspects of your
life, such as sex."
At times, the walls become
another Barlett's with quotes
from great minds and writers of
history.
Advice on women's love lives
is also widespread.
Sexual mores are analyzed as
well. One woman asking "What
do you think about being en
gaged to one man, but in the
meantime casually sleeping
around?" found two responses.
"Stop worrying. He's probably

sleeping with other women,"
said one amatuer Dear Abby
while the Ann Landers of the
lavatories offered, "I think
you're tragically male
identified; women should put
their energy into loving wo
men."

True confessions
And then there are the true
confessions. One upset coed
wrote, "I've never said the word
'penis' aloud. What's wrong
with me?"
Ironically, though, it is the
men's room which is generally
more liberally doused with graf
fiti. Lunde said there are many
theories as to why. Robert Ardry,
in his book Territorial Impera
tive, mentions the need for males
to "identify themselves territo
rially," according to Lunde.
He also said graffiti seems to
have roots in antiquity, with ar
chaeologists finding evidence of
Latin and Egyptian equivalents
of "Joe is an asshole" from an
cient times. He said sex and per
sonal insults were most often

subject matter then as now.
Graffiti is a constant problem
for the custodial crews on cam
pus, but Bruce Wiggins, opera
