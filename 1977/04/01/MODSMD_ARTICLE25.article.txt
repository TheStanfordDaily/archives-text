# Self-defense symposium to be held tomorrow
## 
### 
"Human Behavior in Self-
Defense," a symposium featur
ing presentations from legal,
medical and psychological pro
fessionals plus a martial arts
demonstration, will be held to
morrow morning from 10-12 in
Kresge Auditorium, according
to Shannon Phelps, instructor
and originator of the program.
There will be no charge.
The symposium is an intro
duction to a weekly workshop
offered this spring and summer
entitled "The Stanford Work
shop on Human Behavior in
Self-Defense." The workshop,
says Phelps, will explore in con
siderable depth the areas co
vered in the symposium presen
tations, as well as offer instruc
tion in those functional
techniques which have proven
valuable in physical confronta
tions.
Speakers at the symposium

will include a representative
from Police Services who will
speak on some of the legal fac
tors involved, including defini
tions of "assaulf'and "rape." He
will also discuss law enforce
ment's roleand its practical limi
tations in assessing a crime and
acting against it, says Phelps.
Another topic of discussion
will be the physiological dimen
sion, which Phelps described as
"probably the most often over
looked area" of self-defense.
Emergency procedures for the
treatment of assault (particularly
rape) will also be discussed.
While recognizing that rape is
not the only type of assault to be
dealt with, Phelps hopes that
one of the local and anti-rape or
ganizations will participate in
the symposium in order to
explore that particular type of
assault in some depth.
The morning will conclude

with a martial arts demonstra
tion by Grand Master Mark Saito
of the Saito Academy in Moun
tain View. Saito, from Hon
olulu Hawaii, has taught his art
in California for the last 10years.
The weekly self-defense
workshop will meet Monday
and Wednesday from 4-6 p.m.
in Roble Gym, beginning
Monday, April 11. Dress for the
workshop will be comfortable
clothes, no shoes. It is recom
mended that everyone bring a
notebook. There are no physical
prerequisites.
While there is no charge for
the symposium, there will be a
$15 club fee for the workshop.
