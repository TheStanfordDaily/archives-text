# Bug Me

### Doug Yoshida 
According to the 1976-77 Stanford Stu
dent Directory, 179, i.e., 1.5 per cent of the
11,915 students listed, give their home ad
dress as being within one of the five
boroughs of New York City. The listing"New
York City" refers to the post office classifica
tion "Manhattan Island" only. 1 worked in a
New York Post Office for a year.
-L.G.
Well, in the pursuit of truth, 1 called Vilia
Kakis, the former Bug. She informed me that
the question refered only to New York City,
so this listing alone was the one used at the
Registrar's Office. I guess it's up to "volcano
lover" to decide exactly which information
to use in order to settle the Hawaii wager.
I have just been wandering around in the
new Seeley Mtldd Chemistry Building and
the new Fairchild Medical School building,
both built at the same time across the street
from each other. Could you tell me what Mr.

Mudd and Mr. Fairchild got for their money,
such as: per cent of usable space, cost per
square foot of space, cost per seat and
number of seats in the Braun and Fairchild
auditoriums, etc? Thanks.

Ed Leys, planner for the Fairchild Build
ing, and Rodger Buckhout, planner for the
Seeley Mudd Building, both of the Facilities
Planning Office, gave the same answers to
these questions: there is no answer yet.
Both buildings have yet to be completed.
The top floor of the Fairchild Building re
mains unfinished, and the third floor of the
Seeley Mudd Building has not yet been con
tracted. Thus, any figures for usable space
or cost per square foot would be either unav
ailable or meaningless.
As for the auditoriums, any value attached
to them would be basically arbitrary, be
cause one price was quoted for each of the

buildings. The auditoriums were not paid
for separately.
So, if you are still interested, call Facilities
Planning, but â€” wait a few years.
Yes dear readers, a new Hug has taken
over the Daily's most popular column. After
a string of five female Bugs (including such
famous names as Patty Pels and current
Daily editor Bonny Hodden), The Bug is once
again a male. Bug Me was originated by H.
Bruce "Jitterbug" Litterman way back in
September 1972, and until now, he was the
only male ever to do Bug Me.
Bug Me will appear every Wednesday and
Friday, and the new Bug is ready and wuit
ing to field your inquiries and pet peeves. So,
if something is "bugging you," send a letter
to: Bug Me, c/o the Stanford Daily, Storke
publications Building, Stanford, CA, 943U5.
Or just bring them by the Daily office. Only
initials will be used.
