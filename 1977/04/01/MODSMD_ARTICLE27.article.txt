## Requiem for revolutions 
### 
A Book of Common Prayer
Reviewed by Steven E.
Olson
There is an incredible
photograph of Joan Didion on
the back cover of her new
novel, A Book of Common
Prayer. This thin woman is
modern America's articu
lately alarmed Mona Lisa of
print.
For Didion's heroines seem
to exist as tragically
amplified portraits of her own
fragility and tension. Char
lotte Douglas, the key figure
in A Book of Common Prayer,
is a dysfunctional female who
has reached middle-age and
is losing her family and her
sanity. Maturity has brought
no mellow fruitfulness, but
simply more acute night
mares. I.ike Maria Wyeth of
Play It As It Lays, Charlotte is
continually haunted by "sex
ual surrender and infant
death, commonplaces of the
female obsessional life." Did
ion's private conception of
what constitutes "the female
obsessional life" is the ax she
incisively grinds as a
novelist.

Didion is clearly at her best
when writing about women
on the brink. Grace
Strasser-Mendana, the coolly
rational narrator of her third
novel, strikes one as little
more than mandatory artifice,
a method by which to reas
sembly the fragments of Char
lotte's shattered existence.
Feverish strength
Didion's peculiar genius
seriously limits her range as a
novelist, as her imagination
tends to work like a gravita
tional force, constantly
threatening implosion as it
draws the phenomenological
world into itself with feverish
strength.
A Hook of Common Prayer
is about Charlotte Douglas's
pilgrimage to the small Cent
ral American country of Boca
Grande. As Grace Strasser-
Mendana, the 60 year-old an
thropologist and self-titled
"student of delusion" begins
to tell us about Charlotte, one
quickly senses that he is lis
tening to a strange litany:
"Here is what happened:
she left one man, she left a

second man, she traveled
again with the first; she let
him die alone. She lost one
child to 'history' and
another to 'complications'
. . . she imagined herself
capable of shedding that bag
gage and came to Boca
Grande, a tourist. Una turista.
So she said. In fact she came
here less a tourist than a
sojourner but she did not
make that distinction.
Atomization
More symbolic than real,
Boca Grande represents the
irreversible "atomization" ot
society that Didion described
10 years ago in her clair
voyant essay on the hippies,
"Slouching Towards
Bethlehem." Boca Grande
may also symbolize the rot
ting of the individual mind in
our television society: "There
was once a nine-hole golf
course, but the greens first
went spongy and then re
verted to swamp." Boca
Grande is also hysterically
funny, a Bananas republic
where revolutions occur with
mundane persistency, alter

ing nothing Until Charlotte
shows up.
Didion confirms the
strange fact that it is often the
writer ostensibly least con
cerned with external reality
who manages to convey a
sense of social truth. A Book
of Common Prayer captures
the mood of the seventies as
accurately as Nathanael
West's novels did that of the
thirties. Comedy merges im
perceptibly into hysteria as
bumbling FBI agents pursue
misguided terrorists bloated
with their own rhetoric.
Radical chic
In her own inscrutably
idiosyncratic way, Charlotte
Douglas, married the second
time around to a radical chic
S.F. lawyer, attempts to es
cape both history and respon
sibility. Her daughter, Marin,
has gone underground after
bombing the lobby of the
Transamerica building and
hijacking a jet to Utah. Char
lotte's imaginary closeness to
her daughter is shattered by
this unloreseen act of crazi
ness. Coping had never been
easy for Charlotte, but now, as
the television newspeople
and the FBI suddenly provide
public access to her private
bewilderment, she can with

draw only in blind flight.
Falling in with her out
rageously cynical and dissol
ute first husband (and the
father of Marin), Warren
Bogart, Charlotte begins a
mad journey of mot el
hopping and nonstop insults
that eventually takes her to
the Mountain Brook Country
Club in Birmingham,
Alabama. There, she sum
mons enough Didionesque
courage from "some deep
vacuum of nervous exhaus
tion" to ditch Warren once
and for all. Determined never
to run again, Charlotte sur
faces in Boca Crande, where,
as Grace speculates, she "be
lieved that she had located
herself at the very cervix of
the world, the place through
which a child lost to history
must eventually pass."
Bad brat
Marin, the bad revolutio
nary brat whose actions insti
gate her mother's pilgrimage,
exists in the novel mainly as
an implied presence. She is a
silly fool who throws her life
away and hastens Charlotte's
fragmentation. A terrorist
hippie unable to think, Marin
is a child who opts for bombs
rather than flowers in her ef

fort to change a society she
can't even comprehend. She
lacks the equipment of com
prehension: a grasp of lan
guage.
In A Book of Common
Prayer Didion reaffirms her
belief that language can be a
means of salvation. It is this
conviction, of course, which
lies at the heart of her social
essays in Slouching Towards
Bethlehem. Marin is one of
the "pathetically unequipped
children" who Didion ob
served in the Haight of the
sixties: unequipped to sur
vive "because they do not be
lieve in words . . . their only
proficient vocabulary is in the
society's platitudes." Marin
is described as "a daughter
who never had much use for
words but had finally learned
to string them together so that
they sounded almost like sen
tences."
Misunderstood rhetoric
Marin is the martyr of a
misunderstood rhetoric. The
tape she releases to the public
describes the political
philosophy she and her com
rades are prepared to die for:
"The fact that our organiza
tion is revolutionary in
character is due above all to
the fact that all our activity is

defined as revolutionary."
Marin needs more Freshman
English and less guns. Right
on.
Didion's concern with lan
guage and words conveys a
valiant faith that one must
continue to believe in lan
guage as a moral force. If one
is only careful enough — only
crazy enough to insist, in the
face of modern media
induced madness, that there
is a right word, that not just
any word will do — then one
can at least avoid the abyss,
can, at any rate, continue to
pace the edge with frightened
dignity.
A Book of Common Prayer
presents a wrenchingly
comic and bleak vision of our
culture, brilliantly written by
a woman whose femaleness
haunts her like a failed
suicide's glimpse of God. Di
dion survives her heroines
because she is an artist who
continues to believe that find
ing the right words can make
life, if not less mysteriously
cruel, at least personally chal
lenging. Pericles found his
Marina, but Didion's Char
lotte, herself lost, must lose
her Marin. Both Charlotte and
Marin lacked the words Did
ion doesn't.
