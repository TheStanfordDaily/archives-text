# Patty Hearst to enroll at Stanford
## 
### Jordan Lorence 
Patty Hearst will enroll here next fall
as an undergraduate in psychology,
the Daily has learned.
Joan Schroeder, a 1973 Stanford Law
School graduate who works for
Hearst's defense lawyer, F. Lee Bailey,
said the University agreed last week to
admit Hearst in the fall.
"Patty received a call from the Ad
missions Office last week confirming
her acceptance. I think she's very ex
cited to attend Stanford," Schroeder
said.
The Admissions Office would
neither confirm nor deny the story but
said "an announcement on the subject
would be forthcoming very soon."
A source close to Randolph Hearst,
Patty Hearst's father, said Mr. Hearst
had originally wanted Patty to apply to
Stanford and not to Berkeley. "He was
very disturbed when she went to Cal,"
the source said. Hearst was kidnapped
by the SLA while attending Berkeley
in 1974.
Psychological tests
The source added Patty decided to
apply to Stanford when she was
brought here for psychological tests in
the fall of 1975.
"Patty was very impressed with the
psychologists at Stanford. She told her
father that if she didn't go to jail, she
wanted to attend Stanford and study
psychology."
Hearst applied here when an aide to
Gov. Jerry Brown secretly promised
last spring to pardon her "as soon as
things cooled down a bit," according
to Schroeder. A spokesman for Brown
said the governor was unavailable for
comment.
Schroeder said negotiations began
last spring with Stanford.

"Mr. Bailey sent some men down to
talk with the admissions people," said
Schroeder. "They said that the school
might be able to work things out, but
that there would be many problems,
especially with housing security. Mr.
Bailey came down last year to Stan
ford, ostensibly to give a speech at the
Law School, but really to check out the
campus."
Lee Erickson, former associate dean
of student affairs, said Jordan House is
being cleared out to house Hearst next
fall.
"We decided that she would need
her own place to live. It would be too
dangerous to let her live in one of the
dorms," said Erickson.
"We made a deal with Hearst. If he
would pay for the security and upkeep
of Jordan House, we would work up
some ruse to move all the present resi
dents out of Jordan and cover up the
renovation work.
Androgyny a joke
"We needed a good story to justify
our actions. One of the secretaries
suggested that we say we needed Jor
dan for an Androgyny theme house. At
first we all laughed, but then thought
that it might be a good idea and de
cided to go ahead with it.
"I still can't believe how gullible the
campus was, swallowing such a
ridiculous story. Who would ever
think that we would approve an An
drogyny House and reject a German
Studies House?"
Erickson was fired in January after
he protested the giving of an entire
Row House to Hearst while there is a
housing shortage at Stanford.
'Literal fortress'
A source in the Department of Public
Safety, who refused to be identified,

said Jordan House will be a "literal
fortress" by the time Hearst moves in.
"Over the summer, they are going to
put bulletproof glass in all the win
dows and put a sentry tower in the
roof. All the doors will be replaced
with reinforced steel and the place will
be loaded with alarms. I think she'll
have about 15 security guards staying
with her. The higher-ups at Stanford
don't want some kooky terrorist group
coming in and blowing the campus to
smithereens. They demanded that the
place be made that safe," the source
said.

The Daily was able to question
Hearst by smuggling notes to her
through one of her friends.
Hearst said that she was "looking
forward to coming to Stanford," but
feared she might be lonely because of
the extensive security. She said friends
will be able to visit only after they have
passed a security clearance. Her
guards will want every visitor to pass
through metal detectors before each
visit, similar to the anti-hijacking de
vices used at airports, she said.
Security agents will accompany
Hearst around campus.
"I might even have to wear a dis
guise somedays," she said.
Hearst also said that she would like
to write for the Daily. Her grandfather
was the famous publishing tycoon,
William Randolph Hearst.
Hearst will attend Stanford for two
years. At present, she has no plans for
graduate work.

said "an announcement on the subject
would be forthcoming very soon."
A source close to Randolph Hearst,
Patty Hearst's father, said Mr. Hearst
had originally wanted Patty to apply to
Stanford and not to Berkeley. "He was
very disturbed when she went to Cal,"
the source said. Hearst was kidnapped
by the SLA while attending Berkeley
in 1974.
Psychological tests
The source added Patty decided to
apply to Stanford when she was
brought here for psychological tests in
the fall of 1975.
"Patty was very impressed with the
psychologists at Stanford. She told her
father that if she didn't go to jail, she
wanted to attend Stanford and study
psychology."
Hearst applied here when an aide to
Gov. Jerry Brown secretly promised
last spring to pardon her "as soon as
things cooled down a bit," according
to Schroeder. A spokesman for Brown
said the governor was unavailable for
comment.
Schroeder said negotiations began
last spring with Stanford.

"Mr. Bailey sent some men down to
talk with the admissions people," said
Schroeder. "They said that the school
might be able to work things out, but
that there would be many problems,
especially with housing security. Mr.
Bailey came down last year to Stan
ford, ostensibly to give a speech at the
Law School, but really to check out the
campus."
Lee Erickson, former associate dean
of student affairs, said Jordan House is
being cleared out to house Hearst next
fall.
"We decided that she would need
her own place to live. It would be too
dangerous to let her live in one of the
dorms," said Erickson.
"We made a deal with Hearst. If he
would pay for the security and upkeep
of Jordan House, we would work up
some ruse to move all the present resi
dents out of Jordan and cover up the
renovation work.
Androgyny a joke
"We needed a good story to justify
our actions. One of the secretaries
suggested that we say we needed Jor
dan for an Androgyny theme house. At
first we all laughed, but then thought
that it might be a good idea and de
cided to go ahead with it.
"I still can't believe how gullible the
campus was, swallowing such a
ridiculous story. Who would ever
think that we would approve an An
drogyny House and reject a German
Studies House?"
Erickson was fired in January after
he protested the giving of an entire
Row House to Hearst while there is a
housing shortage at Stanford.
'Literal fortress'
A source in the Department of Public
Safety, who refused to be identified,

said Jordan House will be a "literal
fortress" by the time Hearst moves in.
"Over the summer, they are going to
put bulletproof glass in all the win
dows and put a sentry tower in the
roof. All the doors will be replaced
with reinforced steel and the place will
be loaded with alarms. I think she'll
have about 15 security guards staying
with her. The higher-ups at Stanford
don't want some kooky terrorist group
coming in and blowing the campus to
smithereens. They demanded that the
place be made that safe," the source
said.

The Daily was able to question
Hearst by smuggling notes to her
through one of her friends.
Hearst said that she was "looking
forward to coming to Stanford," but
feared she might be lonely because of
the extensive security. She said friends
will be able to visit only after they have
passed a security clearance. Her
guards will want every visitor to pass
through metal detectors before each
visit, similar to the anti-hijacking de
vices used at airports, she said.
Security agents will accompany
Hearst around campus.
"I might even have to wear a dis
guise somedays," she said.
Hearst also said that she would like
to write for the Daily. Her grandfather
was the famous publishing tycoon,
William Randolph Hearst.
Hearst will attend Stanford for two
years. At present, she has no plans for
graduate work.
Patty Hearst will enroll here next fall
as an undergraduate in psychology,
the Daily has learned.
Joan Schroeder, a 1973 Stanford Law
School graduate who works for
Hearst's defense lawyer, F. Lee Bailey,
said the University agreed last week to
admit Hearst in the fall.
"Patty received a call from the Ad
missions Office last week confirming
her acceptance. I think she's very ex
cited to attend Stanford," Schroeder
said.
The Admissions Office would
neither confirm nor deny the story but
said "an announcement on the subject
