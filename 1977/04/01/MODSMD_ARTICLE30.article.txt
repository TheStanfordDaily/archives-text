# Shuffling the Cards
## 'Deadline USA' 
### Chris Baker 
After writing more stories than I care to think
about, missing more sleep than I can remember
and traveling more than 20,000 miles, I finally
decided to put away my typewriter, notebook
and tape recorder and retire as Daily sports
editor.
Hell, I've been sports editor for the last two
years and during that time 1 had a chance to live
out all of my fantasies.
And in spite of the fact that the job outlook for
journalists is about as promising as the prospect
of going swimming in Lake Lagunita, I've al
ready landed a sports writing job on the
Pasadena Star-News.
So why the hell should I continue writing
sports on the Farm?
I was told that I would enjoy retirement. "You
can play tennis, go to parties and take in some
Giant or Warrior games," said one friend.
This week, my first away from this lovely
construction site, I tried to play tennis and dis
covered that the sign-up lists for courts are
about as long as the waiting list for Cliveden.
Another friend suggested that I take in some
more parties, but I find these events about as
exciting as last season's home football games.
Pro sporting events? I've somehow managed
to attend all the contests that I've really wanted
to see.
Although I've heard all the publicity about
Stanford students being diverse (and even writ
ten some of it myself), I must admit that sports

by Chris Baker

writing is a large part of my life.
As Humphrey Bogart tells an aspiring repor
ter in "Deadline USA," â€” "It may not be the
oldest profession, but it's the best."
While I don't have printer's ink in my veins,
I'm in love with this business. For two years I've
had the best job on the Farm.
I've covered three Rose Bowls, a World
Series, the Crosby and even Stanford football
and basketball.
But it's also one of the hardest jobs. You get to
see the sun rise as you finish a page.
Some of the finest people you'd ever want to
meet work here. And some you wouldn't want
to meet anywhere also stop by this place.
I couldn't imagine sitting down and trying to
talk to Bo Schembechler, Woody Hayes, Jerry
Tarkanian or the athletes at other schools
everyday.
If I'd gone to USC or Michigan I would have
been able to cover some top-ranked teams, but I
never would have met some of the brightest and
best athletes in the nation.
When I travel to other schools I'm always
amazed at the poor quality of the sports sections
in their campus papers. Whether or not you
realize it, every Monday, Wednesday and Fri
day, you're reading the best damn sports sec
tion in the nation.
We aren't about to quit producing this kind of
product. And I'm not about to give up sports
writing.
