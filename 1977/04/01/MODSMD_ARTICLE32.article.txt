# Christiansen signs with KC Chiefs
## 
### Chris Baker 
Former Stanford football
coach Jack Christiansen, fired on
the eve of the Cardinals' 22-20
Big Game victory over Califor
nia, is back in the game.
Kansas City Chiefs head coach
Paul Wiggin, a former Stanford
Ail-American, has added Christ
iansen to his coaching staff.
Christiansen, head coach of the
San Francisco 49ers from 1963
until he was fired in 1967, will
coach the running backs and
work with the quarterbacks.
"I'm excited about the oppor
tunity," said Christiansen. "It
will be great working for Paul."
Christiansen will be studying
the Chiefs' playbook until he re
ports to Kansas City April 11.
"All of the coaches will be out
on scouting assignments until
then," said Christiansen. "In the
meantime, I'll be learning the
Chiefs' terminology.
"Basically,football isthesame
everywhere. It doesn't change
that much. But each club has its
own special language."
Wiggin also announced that
Chet Franklin, a former Stanford
assistant, will move from offen
sive coordinator to linebacker
coach.
"Paul is doing away with the
coordinators' system," said
Christiansen. "Everyone on the
staff will have an equal respon
sibility."
Christiansen will replace
Vince Costello, the defensive
coordinator, who resigned two
weeks ago. "I saw an item about
Costello quitting in Kansas City.
I was interested in the job so I

called Jim Shofner, who is a very
good friend of Wiggin," Christ
iansen said.
"I wanted them to know I was
interested in the job," Christian
sen said.
Wiggin invited Christiansen

back to Kansas City and the
former Stanford mentor was im
pressed with the Chief's Ar
rowhead Stadium. "They
wanted me to come back and
look them over. A very impor
tant thing about assembling a
coaching staff is getting people
you can work with."
Christiansen will have a one
year contract and he will be mak
ing a little more than he made as

head coach here. Stanford must
also pay off the remaining two
years of Christiansen's five-year
contract, reportedly $27,500 per
year.
"That's all assistants ever
get," he said. "You usually stay

as long as the head coach who
hires you. Unless there are prob
lems."
Christiansen, who has been
away from pro football since
1967, says the pro game isn't re
ally different from lryears ago.
"They use computers more in
evaluating film. Now you have
to figure out offensive and de
fensive tendencies by putting

them in the computer."
Many Stanford football critics
said Christiansen would rather
play a round of golf than recruit,
but Christiansen says he'll miss
the task.
"People got the idea that 1
didn't like to recruit and that
isn't true. I enjoyed the role the
head coach had in recruiting. 1
was the one who went to the
homes of the recruits and kind of
sealed the deal. I'm sure thereare
a lot of players at Stanford right
now because of me."
Christiansen doesn't plan to
sell his heme in Palo Alto. He
has four daughters who are still
in college.
Christiansen never had a los
ing season in five years as Stan
ford's head football coach, com
piling a record of 30-22-3. His
best season was 1973 when the
Cards were 7-4.
He was an all-pro defensive
back with the Detroit Lions and
is a member of the Pro Football
Hall of Fame. Christiansen
joined the San Francisco 49ers in
1959 as an assistant and was ele
vated to the top job midway
through the 1963 season. After
being fired in 1967, he accepted
an assistant coaching position
under John Ralston here.
As an assistant on the Farm, he
coached 1970 Heisman Trophy
winner Jim Plunkett and All-
America linebacker Don Parish.
He also served as defensive
back-field coach and his defen
ders limited opponents to less
than a 40 per cent completion
ratio and just four touchdowns
in the air.

joined the San Francisco 49ers in
1959 as an assistant and was ele

through the 1963 season. After
being fired in 1967, he accepted
an assistant coaching position
under John Ralston here.
As an assistant on the Farm, he
coached 1970 Heisman Trophy
winner Jim Plunkett and All-
America linebacker Don Parish.
He also served as defensive
back-field coach and his defen

than a 40 per cent completion
ratio and just four touchdowns

Jack Christiansen
Former Stanford football
coach Jack Christiansen, fired on
the eve of the Cardinals' 22-20
Big Game victory over Califor
nia, is back in the game.
Kansas City Chiefs head coach
Paul Wiggin, a former Stanford
Ail-American, has added Christ
iansen to his coaching staff.
Christiansen, head coach of the
San Francisco 49ers from 1963
until he was fired in 1967, will
coach the running backs and
work with the quarterbacks.
"I'm excited about the oppor
tunity," said Christiansen. "It
will be great working for Paul."
Christiansen will be studying
the Chiefs' playbook until he re
ports to Kansas City April 11.
"All of the coaches will be out
on scouting assignments until
then," said Christiansen. "In the
meantime, I'll be learning the
Chiefs' terminology.
"Basically,football isthesame
everywhere. It doesn't change
that much. But each club has its
own special language."
Wiggin also announced that
Chet Franklin, a former Stanford
assistant, will move from offen
sive coordinator to linebacker
coach.
"Paul is doing away with the
coordinators' system," said
Christiansen. "Everyone on the
staff will have an equal respon
sibility."
Christiansen will replace
Vince Costello, the defensive
coordinator, who resigned two
weeks ago. "I saw an item about
Costello quitting in Kansas City.
I was interested in the job so I

called Jim Shofner, who is a very
good friend of Wiggin," Christ
iansen said.
"I wanted them to know I was
interested in the job," Christian
sen said.
Wiggin invited Christiansen

back to Kansas City and the
former Stanford mentor was im
pressed with the Chief's Ar
rowhead Stadium. "They
wanted me to come back and
look them over. A very impor
tant thing about assembling a
coaching staff is getting people
you can work with."
Christiansen will have a one
year contract and he will be mak
ing a little more than he made as

head coach here. Stanford must
also pay off the remaining two
years of Christiansen's five-year
contract, reportedly $27,500 per
year.
"That's all assistants ever
get," he said. "You usually stay

as long as the head coach who
hires you. Unless there are prob
lems."
Christiansen, who has been
away from pro football since
1967, says the pro game isn't re
ally different from lryears ago.
"They use computers more in
evaluating film. Now you have
to figure out offensive and de
fensive tendencies by putting

them in the computer."
Many Stanford football critics
said Christiansen would rather
play a round of golf than recruit,
but Christiansen says he'll miss
the task.
"People got the idea that 1
didn't like to recruit and that
isn't true. I enjoyed the role the
head coach had in recruiting. 1
was the one who went to the
homes of the recruits and kind of
sealed the deal. I'm sure thereare
a lot of players at Stanford right
now because of me."
Christiansen doesn't plan to
sell his heme in Palo Alto. He
has four daughters who are still
in college.
Christiansen never had a los
ing season in five years as Stan
ford's head football coach, com
piling a record of 30-22-3. His
best season was 1973 when the
Cards were 7-4.
He was an all-pro defensive
back with the Detroit Lions and
is a member of the Pro Football
Hall of Fame. Christiansen
