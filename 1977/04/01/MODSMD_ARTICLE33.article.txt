# Bruins boast two Olympians
## Card spikers meet powerhouse UCLA 
### Bruce Anderson 
Stanford's cindermen open the Pacific-8
season tomorrow against perennial track
powerhouse UCLA in Los Angeles.
The host Bruins annually field one of the
top collegiate dual meet teams in the nation.
From 1970 to 1976 UCLA won 62 of 64 dual
meets, including a string of 42 straight vic
tories.
Olympians Millard Hampton and James
Owens head Bruin coach Jim Bush's track
and field contingent this season. Hampton
captured a silver medal in the 200-meter
dash and won a gold for his leg on the United
States' victorious 400-meter relay team last
summer. Owens finished sixth in the high
hurdles in Montreal.
Other Bruin standouts include pole vaul
ter Mike Tully, triple jumper Willie Banks,
quarter-miler Bennie Myles and half-miler
Conrad Suhr.

Vaulter Tully cleared 18-2V2 two weeks
ago against Tennessee, the second best vault
ever by a collegian. Banks, with a personal
best of 55-1, finished fourth in last June's
U.S. Olympic Trials, missing a trip to
Montreal by less than six inches. Senior
Myles has a lifetime best of 45.8 for 400-
meters while sophomore Suhr set a UCLA
800-meter mark of 1:47.8 as a freshman.
Yet despite these great individual talents,
the Bruins are not fielding one of their
stronger teams this year. The Bruins have
already been knocked over by Arizona State
in a dual meet early in March.
"In many respects, UCLA is like us this
year," Stanford mentor Payton Jordan said
earlier this week. "They have a number of
outstanding people, but they also have some
weaknesses.
"They don't have their usual strength in
the weight events," Jordan said. "And

they're not particularly strong in the dis
tance events."
Stanford sends javelin throwers Ricky
Brown and Tom Ellis, shot putters Terry Al
britton and Doug Greenwood and discus
throwers Rick Buss, Albritton and Green
wood to play Paris to UCLA's Achilles to
morrow.
In order to stay close to UCLA Stanford
also needs good performances from its dis
tance runners. The Cards enter Jeff Parietti,
Jerry Emory and Roy Kissin in the 5000-
meter run and Bill Haldemanand Bill Gail in
the 3000-meter steeplechase.
One of the better matchups of the after
noon comes when Alan Sheats and James
Lofton meet Myles in the 400-meter dash.
Sheats ran a 45.9 relay leg last weekend in
Mexico City while Lofton has twice ran an
open 46.6 this year.

Jerry Emory and Roy Kissin in the 5000-
meter run and Bill Haldemanand Bill Gail in
the 3000-meter steeplechase.
One of the better matchups of the after
noon comes when Alan Sheats and James
Lofton meet Myles in the 400-meter dash.
Sheats ran a 45.9 relay leg last weekend in
Mexico City while Lofton has twice ran an
open 46.6 this year.

meet in Mexico City. The Cards compete against UCLA this
weekend in Los Angeles.

Marching along
A contingent of six Stanford athletes, representing the Cardinal
track squad, march by the Olympic rings during the opening
Stanford's cindermen open the Pacific-8
season tomorrow against perennial track
powerhouse UCLA in Los Angeles.
The host Bruins annually field one of the
top collegiate dual meet teams in the nation.
From 1970 to 1976 UCLA won 62 of 64 dual
meets, including a string of 42 straight vic
tories.
Olympians Millard Hampton and James
Owens head Bruin coach Jim Bush's track
and field contingent this season. Hampton
captured a silver medal in the 200-meter
dash and won a gold for his leg on the United
States' victorious 400-meter relay team last
summer. Owens finished sixth in the high
hurdles in Montreal.
Other Bruin standouts include pole vaul
ter Mike Tully, triple jumper Willie Banks,
quarter-miler Bennie Myles and half-miler
Conrad Suhr.

Vaulter Tully cleared 18-2V2 two weeks
ago against Tennessee, the second best vault
ever by a collegian. Banks, with a personal
best of 55-1, finished fourth in last June's
U.S. Olympic Trials, missing a trip to
Montreal by less than six inches. Senior
Myles has a lifetime best of 45.8 for 400-
meters while sophomore Suhr set a UCLA
800-meter mark of 1:47.8 as a freshman.
Yet despite these great individual talents,
the Bruins are not fielding one of their
stronger teams this year. The Bruins have
already been knocked over by Arizona State
in a dual meet early in March.
"In many respects, UCLA is like us this
year," Stanford mentor Payton Jordan said
earlier this week. "They have a number of
outstanding people, but they also have some
weaknesses.
"They don't have their usual strength in
the weight events," Jordan said. "And

they're not particularly strong in the dis
tance events."
Stanford sends javelin throwers Ricky
Brown and Tom Ellis, shot putters Terry Al
britton and Doug Greenwood and discus
throwers Rick Buss, Albritton and Green
wood to play Paris to UCLA's Achilles to
morrow.
In order to stay close to UCLA Stanford
also needs good performances from its dis
tance runners. The Cards enter Jeff Parietti,
Jerry Emory and Roy Kissin in the 5000-
meter run and Bill Haldemanand Bill Gail in
the 3000-meter steeplechase.
One of the better matchups of the after
