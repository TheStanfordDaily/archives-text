# Cards travel south
## Netters look to upset UCLA, USC 
### Jill Lieber 
The Stanford tennis team has
an upset on its mind.
This weekend the Cards travel
south to take on I CLA, the na
tion's No. 1 team Friday and No.
4 ranked USC Saturday. And ac
cording to coach Dick Gould, the
squad has its work cut out for it.
"We've never swept both
matches in Los Angeles," Gould
said. "UCLAhasalwaysgivenus
trouble. On paper they look like
a tough team, but they've got a
lot of young kids, just like we do.
"We haven't lost to USC in the
last four years. I hat's nine
straight times we've beaten
them. But their whole team is
back and they are strong in dual
meet competition."
UCLA, 9-0 on the season, has
been hurt by graduation and de
fection to the pros, just like the
Cards. But both teams remain
powers.
Senior captain Ferdi Taygan
leads this year's team. A three
year All-American, Taygan is
the nation's top-ranking colle
gian and is No. 41 in the national
singles rankings. Last year he
teamed with Peter Fleming to
win the NCAA doubles title,
overwhelming USC's Bruce
Manson and Chris Lewis, 6-0,
6-2, 6-4, in the finals.
Although coming off toe
surgery, Taygan still is the man
to beat for the Cards' No. 1 man,
Matt Mitchell.
But the sophomore All-
American can do it. **Well, he'll
have to if the Cards want to beat

the tough Bruins.
"We've got to win all our sing
les matches," Gould said. "If we
beat Taygan it will definitely be
an upset. But Matt has improved
rapidly since last season—every
part of his game is better. And
his mental attitude has changed
too.
"Matt compares to Sandy
Mayer when he was a sophomore.
He's as good or better than Sandy
was at that point in his develop
ment. Their serve and the way
they hit the ball are much the
same."
At the No. 2 spot for the Cards
is junior Bill Maze. UCLA no
longer has tough Brian Teacher
at this spot due to graduation,
but they've got the top freshman
player in the country, Van
Winitsky. Winitsky came to
UCLA this fall from Florida as
the fourth-ranked National
Junior player and with another
year remaining in the 18-and
under division. He and Taygan
compliment each other well as
the No. 1 doubles team.
Rounding out the rest of the
ladder are juniors Tony Graham
and Bruce Nichols, freshmen
John Payley and sophomore
John Austin. Doubles pairings
are Graham-Nichols and
Austin-Payley.
Even though the Bruins are at
the top at this point in the sea
son, virtually everyone "in the
know"says USC is the team to
beat. The Trojans tied for the
NCAA title last year with UCLA
and their top five players return.
Bruce Manson, Chris Lewis,
Mike Newberry, Andy Lucchesi
and Charles Strode try to do it
again this year — only better. For
balance and reliability experts
say it's a formidable line-up.
"Yes," said USC coach George
Toley, "we came along very
strongly in the latter part of last
year and with a year of addi
tional experience, we're going to
be stronger still."
Trinity's Bob McKinley said,
"Sure, USC is the team to beat
but they don't have the type of
player — they don't have a Billy
Martin — who will dominate,
who will win a match every time
he walks out on the court. Any

thing they get, they'll have to
fight for."
"I'd really love to beat 'SC,"
Gould said. "USC has a real edge
in doubles. Matt and Perry lost
badly against Manson and Lewis
earlier this season."
However, Gould said, the Card
duo is capable of winning the
NCAA doubles title, especially
with the way Wright has been
playing. He could already walk
off with this year's most im
proved player award and the
season has only just begun. He
qualified for La Costa with a big
win over Mike Cahill, who is

best known as the doubles part
ner of former Stanford star,
NCAA singles champ John Whit
linger.
Maze and John Kast and Jim
Hodges and Lloyd Bourne round
out the doubles line-up for Stan
ford. At the No. 3-6 spots in sing
les are Wright, Kast, Hodges and
Bourne.
"Our next nine matches are
against the teams ranked in the
top 17 in the country," Gould
said. "1 hope our guys do as well
in their matches as they have
shown they are capable of."
