# IM roundup
## Spring IMs set 
### 
JRA and Les Vaches have
taken commanding leads in de
fense of their intramural team ti
tles and most signup sheets
come down today as IM competi
tion enters spring quarter.
The Junipero Ringers' Associ
ation (JRA), last year's IM kings,
appear to be headed for a new IM
total points record. Its 505 point
total gives it an almost insur
mountable lead over its closest
pursuers, Biz II and the Theta
Delts. All three lead their respec
tive divisions, while Soto is the
No. 1 dorm again and El Toro the
top-rated eating club.
Les Vaches, which won the
first women's title last season,
added the 'A' league basketball
crown to their football and ten
nis championships to lead this
year's race with 203 points. Soto
remains the top dorm, with a
slim four-point lead over Faisan.
Spring quarter is traditionally
the most active period for in
tramurals, and this year will be
no exception as participants
choose from 12 different sports,
including league activities
softball, six-man volleyball and
water polo.
Each softball team is required
to supply one umpire, who must
attend an instruction clinic
either today or Monday at 4 p.m.
in the IM office. Anyone in
terested may become an umpire,

with pay set at $2.50 per game.
Besides the league sports
listed above, single elimination
tournaments in tennis singles,
badminton and horseshoes will
be offered. Bowling will take the
format of two-man scratch
teams; signups will be posted at
Tresidder lanes instead of En
cina Gym.
Three meet sports will be held,
with track and field holding its
preliminaries on May 14 and fi
nals on May 21. The bike race
will once again be held at the
SI.AC course and is scheduled
for May 8. The swimming and
diving competition will be held
on May 18 beginning at 2 p.m.
Two innovative sports will be
offered for the second year. Both
innertube water polo and ulti
mate frisbee received sufficient
participation last spring to retain
them on a trial basis on the 1M
program.
