Gromyko calls nuclear limits unfair
Moscow — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko said yesterday that the Kremlin had
turned down American nuclear weapons limits
because they were unfair and inconsistent.
Gromyko, in a televised news conference
watched by millions of Soviets, said Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance's contention that the Russians
had rejected a broad arms control proposal was
"basically false" and he mentioned numbers and
details which Vance had not publicly discussed.
Carter administration criticism of human
rights issues in the Soviet Union had no direct
effect on the rejection of the proposals made by
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in Moscow this
week, Gromyko said.
But rising to his feet for emphasis, the veteran
Soviet minister said "the fact is that everything
said about rights by theUnited States . . .worsens
the atmosphere, hurts the political atmosphere
for discussion of other issues including arms
limitation."
Vance left Moscow yesterday morning after
announcing the Soviet Union had rejected both a
limited American proposal and a "comprehen
sive" plan for deep cuts in both countries' nuc
lear arsenals.
Vance's limited proposal was essentially a call
to ratify a 1974 Vladivostok pact which called for
both sides to keep to 2400 nuclear land-based
missiles, strategic bombers and missiles on sub
marines. But it left out the potent new American
cruise missile, which was developed after Vla
divostok, and the new Soviet Backfire bomber.
Gromyko insisted that the cruise missile be
counted as a strategic weapon while the Backfire
be considered "not strategic."
Carter's rebate plan lacks support
Washington — Sen. Russell Long, who will
lead the floor fight for Senate passage of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's tax rebate plan, said yester
day that the rebate will be defeated unless Carter
drums up additional support for it.
"If the vote were taken today, the rebate would
lose," Long, a Louisiana Democrat, said in an
interview.

In addition, Long predicted that Carter would
veto any economic stimulus bill that substituted
a permanent tax cut for the $50 rebate he prop
osed as a means of giving a quick boost to the
economy. Carter's proposals already call for a tax
cut in addition to the rebate.
The 38 Republicans in the Senate are united in
opposition to the rebate and there is little en
thusiasm among the Democratic majority for the
plan. Long and other senators have said they
think Carter also hurt his cause by initiating a
review of federally funded water projects, a move
that drew angry protests from many members of
Congress.
Khaalis jailed for making threats
Washington — Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, free
since his Hanafi Moslem band held 134 hostages,
was jailed yesterday after a judge was told a
police wiretap recorded Khaalis making
"blood-curdling threats."
Within hours after Khaalis was taken to jail, his
son-in-law was arrested on a federal weapons
charge and Treasury agents armed with warrants
searched two houses in suburban Maryland.
"We found guns at both premises," said War
ren McConnell a spokesman for Treasury's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "We
understand members of the Hanafis live there."
The arrests and raids followed a policeman's
testimony at a hearing for Khaalis that since 1973
the Hanafis have bought 40 or 50 guns.
At the hearing, the judge was told of the threats
overheard on a court-ordered wiretap.
Chief Judge Harold Greene of the District of
Columbia Superior Court said he did not regard
the threats "as idle words" and agreed with pro
secutors that Khaalis posed a danger to the com
munity.
Khaalis had been out on personal recognizance
and it was that no-money bond that was revoked
on grounds he had violated conditions of his
release.
Guard halts armed Moscone visitor
San Francisco — A security guard subdued a
man who came to Mayor George Moscone's office

with a loaded pistol, authorities reported yester
day.
Walter Jones, 32, was booked into jail for inves
tigation of carrying a loaded firearm in public,
and later for destroying jail property after jailors
said he broke a commode in a fit of anger.
Security officer Gary Wommack said Jones
seemed agitated when he came into the mayor's
outer office Wednesday.
He approached Jones, asking if he could help,
then Jones pulled an automatic pistol from under
his jacket. Wommack immediately lunged for
him, finally subduing him.
Police Chief Charles Gain ordered an investiga
tion into how Jones got through the City Hall
security precautions instituted in February after
a series of bombings, attempted bombings and
threats against city officials by the underground
New World Liberation Front.
Ruling ups nuclear mishap liability
Washington — A federal district judge de
clared unconstitutional yesterday the law that
limits the financial liability of power companies
for nuclear accidents.
If allowed to stand, the ruling would leave
nuclear-power companies open to unlimited lia
bility claims and raise major doubts about the
future of atomic energy in the United States.
Judge James McMillan of the Western District
of North Carolina struck down the Price-
Anderson Act as an unconstitutional deprivation
of property without due process of law.
The law limits liability in a single nuclear mis
hap to $560 million, and was challenged in a suit
brought by the Carolina Environmental Study
Group, against the U.S. Atomic Energy Commis
sion, now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
and Duke Power Co., which is building two
atomic plants near Charlotte, N.C.
The suit argued that a serious accident at a
nuclear-power plant could cause the public to
suffer billions of dollars of damages which the
law would arbitrarily prevent them from ever
recovering.
Canary crash prompts $2 billion suit
San Francisco — A class action damage suit

totaling almost $2 billion was filed yesterday in
behalf of 306 Californians killed or injured in the
disastrous collision of two jumbo jets in the Ca
nary Islands.
The suit seeks $6.5 million damages for each of
the Californians involved, for a total of
$1,989,000,000.
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for
Harold McClintock of Placerville, whose mother
Myrtle McClintock died in the crash, and David
Nelson Roman of Sunnyvale, whose mother,
Ruth Roman, also died in aviation's worst disas
ter.
Defendants are Fan American World Airways,
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the Boeing Corp.,
which built the two 747 jetliners which collided.
The suit said both airlines owed their passen
gers "a duty to use the highest degree of care in
the operation, management and maintenance of
their airplanes."
Nevertheless, it alleges the defendants "were
guilty of willful and wanton misconduct and
acted with a conscious indifference and with re
ckless disregard for the safety of their passengers
and others and with the full knowledge that those
passengers and others would be placed in a posi
tion of extreme peril."
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday with patchy morning
fog. Slightly warmer days. Lows tonight in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in
the upper 50s and 60s. Northwest winds 10 to 20
mph afternoons and evenings.

with a loaded pistol, authorities reported yester
day.
Walter Jones, 32, was booked into jail for inves
tigation of carrying a loaded firearm in public,
and later for destroying jail property after jailors
said he broke a commode in a fit of anger.
Security officer Gary Wommack said Jones
seemed agitated when he came into the mayor's
outer office Wednesday.
He approached Jones, asking if he could help,
then Jones pulled an automatic pistol from under
his jacket. Wommack immediately lunged for
him, finally subduing him.
Police Chief Charles Gain ordered an investiga
tion into how Jones got through the City Hall
security precautions instituted in February after
a series of bombings, attempted bombings and
threats against city officials by the underground
New World Liberation Front.
Ruling ups nuclear mishap liability
Washington — A federal district judge de
clared unconstitutional yesterday the law that
limits the financial liability of power companies
for nuclear accidents.
If allowed to stand, the ruling would leave
nuclear-power companies open to unlimited lia
bility claims and raise major doubts about the
future of atomic energy in the United States.
Judge James McMillan of the Western District
of North Carolina struck down the Price-
Anderson Act as an unconstitutional deprivation
of property without due process of law.
The law limits liability in a single nuclear mis
hap to $560 million, and was challenged in a suit
brought by the Carolina Environmental Study
Group, against the U.S. Atomic Energy Commis
sion, now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
and Duke Power Co., which is building two
atomic plants near Charlotte, N.C.
The suit argued that a serious accident at a
nuclear-power plant could cause the public to
suffer billions of dollars of damages which the
law would arbitrarily prevent them from ever
recovering.
Canary crash prompts $2 billion suit
San Francisco — A class action damage suit

totaling almost $2 billion was filed yesterday in
behalf of 306 Californians killed or injured in the
disastrous collision of two jumbo jets in the Ca
nary Islands.
The suit seeks $6.5 million damages for each of
the Californians involved, for a total of
$1,989,000,000.
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for
Harold McClintock of Placerville, whose mother
Myrtle McClintock died in the crash, and David
Nelson Roman of Sunnyvale, whose mother,
Ruth Roman, also died in aviation's worst disas
ter.
Defendants are Fan American World Airways,
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the Boeing Corp.,
which built the two 747 jetliners which collided.
The suit said both airlines owed their passen
gers "a duty to use the highest degree of care in
the operation, management and maintenance of
their airplanes."
Nevertheless, it alleges the defendants "were
guilty of willful and wanton misconduct and
acted with a conscious indifference and with re
ckless disregard for the safety of their passengers
and others and with the full knowledge that those
passengers and others would be placed in a posi
tion of extreme peril."
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday with patchy morning
fog. Slightly warmer days. Lows tonight in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in
the upper 50s and 60s. Northwest winds 10 to 20
mph afternoons and evenings.
Gromyko calls nuclear limits unfair
Moscow — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko said yesterday that the Kremlin had
turned down American nuclear weapons limits
because they were unfair and inconsistent.
Gromyko, in a televised news conference
watched by millions of Soviets, said Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance's contention that the Russians
had rejected a broad arms control proposal was
"basically false" and he mentioned numbers and
details which Vance had not publicly discussed.
Carter administration criticism of human
rights issues in the Soviet Union had no direct
effect on the rejection of the proposals made by
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in Moscow this
week, Gromyko said.
But rising to his feet for emphasis, the veteran
Soviet minister said "the fact is that everything
said about rights by theUnited States . . .worsens
the atmosphere, hurts the political atmosphere
for discussion of other issues including arms
limitation."
Vance left Moscow yesterday morning after
announcing the Soviet Union had rejected both a
limited American proposal and a "comprehen
sive" plan for deep cuts in both countries' nuc
lear arsenals.
Vance's limited proposal was essentially a call
to ratify a 1974 Vladivostok pact which called for
both sides to keep to 2400 nuclear land-based
missiles, strategic bombers and missiles on sub
marines. But it left out the potent new American
cruise missile, which was developed after Vla
divostok, and the new Soviet Backfire bomber.
Gromyko insisted that the cruise missile be
counted as a strategic weapon while the Backfire
be considered "not strategic."
Carter's rebate plan lacks support
Washington — Sen. Russell Long, who will
lead the floor fight for Senate passage of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's tax rebate plan, said yester
day that the rebate will be defeated unless Carter
drums up additional support for it.
"If the vote were taken today, the rebate would
lose," Long, a Louisiana Democrat, said in an
interview.

In addition, Long predicted that Carter would
veto any economic stimulus bill that substituted
a permanent tax cut for the $50 rebate he prop
osed as a means of giving a quick boost to the
economy. Carter's proposals already call for a tax
cut in addition to the rebate.
The 38 Republicans in the Senate are united in
opposition to the rebate and there is little en
thusiasm among the Democratic majority for the
plan. Long and other senators have said they
think Carter also hurt his cause by initiating a
review of federally funded water projects, a move
that drew angry protests from many members of
Congress.
Khaalis jailed for making threats
Washington — Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, free
since his Hanafi Moslem band held 134 hostages,
was jailed yesterday after a judge was told a
police wiretap recorded Khaalis making
"blood-curdling threats."
Within hours after Khaalis was taken to jail, his
son-in-law was arrested on a federal weapons
charge and Treasury agents armed with warrants
searched two houses in suburban Maryland.
"We found guns at both premises," said War
ren McConnell a spokesman for Treasury's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "We
understand members of the Hanafis live there."
The arrests and raids followed a policeman's
testimony at a hearing for Khaalis that since 1973
the Hanafis have bought 40 or 50 guns.
At the hearing, the judge was told of the threats
overheard on a court-ordered wiretap.
Chief Judge Harold Greene of the District of
Columbia Superior Court said he did not regard
the threats "as idle words" and agreed with pro
secutors that Khaalis posed a danger to the com
munity.
Khaalis had been out on personal recognizance
and it was that no-money bond that was revoked
on grounds he had violated conditions of his
release.

effect on the rejection of the proposals made by
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in Moscow this
week, Gromyko said.
But rising to his feet for emphasis, the veteran
Soviet minister said "the fact is that everything
said about rights by theUnited States . . .worsens
the atmosphere, hurts the political atmosphere
for discussion of other issues including arms
limitation."
Vance left Moscow yesterday morning after
announcing the Soviet Union had rejected both a
limited American proposal and a "comprehen
sive" plan for deep cuts in both countries' nuc
lear arsenals.
Vance's limited proposal was essentially a call
to ratify a 1974 Vladivostok pact which called for
both sides to keep to 2400 nuclear land-based
missiles, strategic bombers and missiles on sub
marines. But it left out the potent new American
cruise missile, which was developed after Vla
divostok, and the new Soviet Backfire bomber.
Gromyko insisted that the cruise missile be
counted as a strategic weapon while the Backfire
be considered "not strategic."
Carter's rebate plan lacks support
Washington — Sen. Russell Long, who will
lead the floor fight for Senate passage of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's tax rebate plan, said yester
day that the rebate will be defeated unless Carter
drums up additional support for it.
"If the vote were taken today, the rebate would
lose," Long, a Louisiana Democrat, said in an
interview.

In addition, Long predicted that Carter would
veto any economic stimulus bill that substituted
a permanent tax cut for the $50 rebate he prop
osed as a means of giving a quick boost to the
economy. Carter's proposals already call for a tax
cut in addition to the rebate.
The 38 Republicans in the Senate are united in
opposition to the rebate and there is little en
thusiasm among the Democratic majority for the
plan. Long and other senators have said they
think Carter also hurt his cause by initiating a
review of federally funded water projects, a move
that drew angry protests from many members of
Congress.
Khaalis jailed for making threats
Washington — Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, free
since his Hanafi Moslem band held 134 hostages,
was jailed yesterday after a judge was told a
police wiretap recorded Khaalis making
"blood-curdling threats."
Within hours after Khaalis was taken to jail, his
son-in-law was arrested on a federal weapons
charge and Treasury agents armed with warrants
searched two houses in suburban Maryland.
"We found guns at both premises," said War
ren McConnell a spokesman for Treasury's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "We
understand members of the Hanafis live there."
The arrests and raids followed a policeman's
testimony at a hearing for Khaalis that since 1973
the Hanafis have bought 40 or 50 guns.
At the hearing, the judge was told of the threats
overheard on a court-ordered wiretap.
Chief Judge Harold Greene of the District of
Columbia Superior Court said he did not regard
the threats "as idle words" and agreed with pro
secutors that Khaalis posed a danger to the com
munity.
Khaalis had been out on personal recognizance
and it was that no-money bond that was revoked
on grounds he had violated conditions of his
release.
Guard halts armed Moscone visitor
San Francisco — A security guard subdued a
man who came to Mayor George Moscone's office

with a loaded pistol, authorities reported yester
day.
Walter Jones, 32, was booked into jail for inves
tigation of carrying a loaded firearm in public,
and later for destroying jail property after jailors
said he broke a commode in a fit of anger.
Security officer Gary Wommack said Jones
seemed agitated when he came into the mayor's
outer office Wednesday.
He approached Jones, asking if he could help,
then Jones pulled an automatic pistol from under
his jacket. Wommack immediately lunged for
him, finally subduing him.
Police Chief Charles Gain ordered an investiga
tion into how Jones got through the City Hall
security precautions instituted in February after
a series of bombings, attempted bombings and
threats against city officials by the underground
New World Liberation Front.
Ruling ups nuclear mishap liability
Washington — A federal district judge de
clared unconstitutional yesterday the law that
limits the financial liability of power companies
for nuclear accidents.
If allowed to stand, the ruling would leave
nuclear-power companies open to unlimited lia
bility claims and raise major doubts about the
future of atomic energy in the United States.
Judge James McMillan of the Western District
of North Carolina struck down the Price-
Anderson Act as an unconstitutional deprivation
of property without due process of law.
The law limits liability in a single nuclear mis
hap to $560 million, and was challenged in a suit
brought by the Carolina Environmental Study
Group, against the U.S. Atomic Energy Commis
sion, now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
and Duke Power Co., which is building two
atomic plants near Charlotte, N.C.
The suit argued that a serious accident at a
nuclear-power plant could cause the public to
suffer billions of dollars of damages which the
law would arbitrarily prevent them from ever
recovering.
Canary crash prompts $2 billion suit
San Francisco — A class action damage suit

totaling almost $2 billion was filed yesterday in
behalf of 306 Californians killed or injured in the
disastrous collision of two jumbo jets in the Ca
nary Islands.
The suit seeks $6.5 million damages for each of
the Californians involved, for a total of
$1,989,000,000.
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for
Harold McClintock of Placerville, whose mother
Myrtle McClintock died in the crash, and David
Nelson Roman of Sunnyvale, whose mother,
Ruth Roman, also died in aviation's worst disas
ter.
Defendants are Fan American World Airways,
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the Boeing Corp.,
which built the two 747 jetliners which collided.
The suit said both airlines owed their passen
gers "a duty to use the highest degree of care in
the operation, management and maintenance of
their airplanes."
Nevertheless, it alleges the defendants "were
guilty of willful and wanton misconduct and
acted with a conscious indifference and with re
ckless disregard for the safety of their passengers
and others and with the full knowledge that those
passengers and others would be placed in a posi
tion of extreme peril."
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday with patchy morning
fog. Slightly warmer days. Lows tonight in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in
the upper 50s and 60s. Northwest winds 10 to 20
mph afternoons and evenings.
Gromyko calls nuclear limits unfair
Moscow — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko said yesterday that the Kremlin had
turned down American nuclear weapons limits
because they were unfair and inconsistent.
Gromyko, in a televised news conference
watched by millions of Soviets, said Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance's contention that the Russians
had rejected a broad arms control proposal was
"basically false" and he mentioned numbers and
details which Vance had not publicly discussed.
