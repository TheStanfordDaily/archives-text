# Trustees ban 'Chappie' issue
## 
### Randy Keith 
The reg-pack issue of the Chaparral
humor magazine which usually comes
out on registration day was banned
this quarter by the Board of Trustees,
according to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs.
The trustees voted at their meeting
in early March to ban the magazine
"because of its gross violations of
human decency," Rosenzweig said.
Jon Barth, editor of the magazine,
said "We like to write about sex and
violence and stuff like that because we
don't get any of it ourselves. I think
that we appeal to all the other nerds
around here."
The Daily has obtained a copy of the
magazine which has as its theme "The
truth behind the Board of Trustee
meetings."
The magazine is highlighted by —
—A five page pictorial section
which shows members of the board

engaged in various aspects of sexual
activity.
— A full page comic strip that de
grades several religious groups to
which board members belong.
— An interview with one of the
board members in which the member
attacks University financial aid to
minority students and advocates the
return of the Indian as the school mas-
Cot
Jeff Stoler, a member of the Chapar
ral staff, said they had tried to sell the
banned copies from their office but on
Tuesday the University ordered a high
chain link fence be erected around the
Storke Student Publications Building
(in which the Chaparral has offices)
cutting down access to the building.
Stoler said on Wednesday electri
cians installed a television camera in
what used to be a floodlight fixture.
"When I asked them what they were
doing, they told me they were just re
placing the light," he said.

Rosenzweig admitted a closed cir
cuit TV camera had been installed, but
said "it was put there for security
reasons. We want to make sure the area
is well-lit for students' protection."
Rosenzweig also confirmed that the
chain link fence was moved but he said
that is was merely "coincidental."
"The construction company had to
move the fence so that they could start
landscaping for the Terman Build
ing."
When told the fence had been
moved a second time on Wednesday
cutting down access even more, he
said "We had them move it just a bit
closer, we want to discourage students
from approaching the building."
Stoler said that theChaparral would
start selling issues in the dining halls
tonight. "They can try to arrest us if
they want," he said. "They'll never
catch us all."
