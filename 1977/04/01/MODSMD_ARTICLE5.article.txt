# ASSU Senate votes to call off COP, assessment election
## 
### Bonny Rodden 
In a meeting that lasted until early this morning, the
ASSU Senate voted 11-3 to call off the spring election
scheduled to be held April 13 and 14.
Students would have voted on candidates for the Council
of Presidents (COP), and senior class presidents along with
numerous fee assessments and resolutions had the election
been held.
Senators argued that calling off the election would pre
vent a new COP from coming into power once the current
council's term expires in April.
"The executive branch has too much power over the
senate and the students. We've got to stop them (presidents)
before they can begin," Sen. Tim Ferguson said.
Ferguson, a noted libertarian, added that abolishing the
council would be "the first step to the best government —
no government."
Refusal to comment
Asked in an interview after the meeting why he had run
for the senate if he believed in anarchy and if he intended on
abolishing the senate as well as the COP, Ferguson refused
to comment.
Sen. Brad Krevoy, who was running for president on the
Rodney Johnson slate, argued the senate did not have the
authority to call off the election.
Sen. Jeff Stoler, the senate's expert on fine points of the
ASSU Constitution and By-laws, protested Krevoy's objec
tion.
Reading a copy of the constitution Stoler told the Senate,
"Article two, section six specifically states that the senate

has the power to interpret the constitution and the by-laws
any way it sees fit."
Postponing election
Stoler continued, "A few weeks ago I tried to postpone
the election to straighten out some ambiguities in the con
stitution. But (ASSU President Vic) Petroff told me I
couldn't change the election dates so easily because they
were stated in the constitution."
He called Petroff "a conniving autocrat" for vetoing past
legislation and for intervening on the election date issue.
He said, "I can play games with the constitution too. You
say we've tried to circumvent the constitution by passing
amendments to the by-laws instead of to the constitution.
Well, section six clearly shows we can do anything we want
with the constitution."
Singing resolution
Stoler and two other Hammer & Coffin senators intro
duced the resolution which amends the by-laws by stand
ing before the senate and singing a song.
The last verse of the song attacked Krevoy:
"Too bad, Krevoy. you really want the top,
You were climbing higher year after year.
but it's us (sic) who made you stop."
The final vote was taken at 1:30 a.m. Senators J.J. Chao
and John Paval sided against the resolution with Krevoy.
Interviewed after the meeting, Petroff said he was "em
barrassed by the senate's action" and "disgusted" that they
were not serving the students.
"They don't care about the students. They're on a power
trip. Stoler's just mad because he never became president,
Petroff said.

In a meeting that lasted until early this morning, the
ASSU Senate voted 11-3 to call off the spring election
scheduled to be held April 13 and 14.
Students would have voted on candidates for the Council
of Presidents (COP), and senior class presidents along with
numerous fee assessments and resolutions had the election
been held.
Senators argued that calling off the election would pre
vent a new COP from coming into power once the current
council's term expires in April.
"The executive branch has too much power over the
senate and the students. We've got to stop them (presidents)
before they can begin," Sen. Tim Ferguson said.
Ferguson, a noted libertarian, added that abolishing the
council would be "the first step to the best government —
no government."
Refusal to comment
Asked in an interview after the meeting why he had run
for the senate if he believed in anarchy and if he intended on
abolishing the senate as well as the COP, Ferguson refused
to comment.
Sen. Brad Krevoy, who was running for president on the
Rodney Johnson slate, argued the senate did not have the
authority to call off the election.
Sen. Jeff Stoler, the senate's expert on fine points of the
ASSU Constitution and By-laws, protested Krevoy's objec
tion.
Reading a copy of the constitution Stoler told the Senate,
"Article two, section six specifically states that the senate

has the power to interpret the constitution and the by-laws
any way it sees fit."
Postponing election
Stoler continued, "A few weeks ago I tried to postpone
the election to straighten out some ambiguities in the con
stitution. But (ASSU President Vic) Petroff told me I
couldn't change the election dates so easily because they
were stated in the constitution."
He called Petroff "a conniving autocrat" for vetoing past
legislation and for intervening on the election date issue.
He said, "I can play games with the constitution too. You
say we've tried to circumvent the constitution by passing
amendments to the by-laws instead of to the constitution.
Well, section six clearly shows we can do anything we want
with the constitution."
Singing resolution
Stoler and two other Hammer & Coffin senators intro
duced the resolution which amends the by-laws by stand
ing before the senate and singing a song.
The last verse of the song attacked Krevoy:
"Too bad, Krevoy. you really want the top,
You were climbing higher year after year.
but it's us (sic) who made you stop."
The final vote was taken at 1:30 a.m. Senators J.J. Chao
and John Paval sided against the resolution with Krevoy.
Interviewed after the meeting, Petroff said he was "em
barrassed by the senate's action" and "disgusted" that they
were not serving the students.
"They don't care about the students. They're on a power
trip. Stoler's just mad because he never became president,
Petroff said.
