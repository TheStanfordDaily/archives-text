## NIH guidelines inadequate 
### 
From the content of Allan Chen's
reply (Daily, Mar. 4) to Steve Hansch's
column on recombinant DNA re
search, one wonders if Chen has some
thing to gain personally from this re
search or if he merely enjoys making
public statements which show his own
ignorance and shortsightedness.
Most of Chen's "vocal minority" are
not acting out of "irrational fear and
ignorance," but are people who have
taken the time to research the issue, to
meet with others who are equally con
cerned, and to publicize what they feel
to be some of the most potentially
harmful scientific experiments being
conducted today.
The question being asked is whether

or not decisions concerning public
health risks from publicly funded re
search (and from private research —
the dangers are just as great) should be
left entirely up to the scientific com
munity.
Is science existing in a vacuum or
does it exist to serve the people? If the
latter is true, which I suspect most
funding requests seek to show, then
the public should have a larger role in
deciding what is to be studied and in
what manner.
Chen seems to be unaware of the his
tory behind the formulation of the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH)
guidelines. In the 19605, scientists
working with simian virus 40, (SV4O),
e tumor virus which causes human
cells in vitro to act cancerous, thought
it to be incapable of causing human
disease. The virus was an unrecog
nized contaminant of polio vaccines
and some cold shots before 1962.
Since Nixon's "war" on cancer
however, a good deal of the funding for
cancer research has gone to support
the study of these viruses. No one
knows what the consequences of
widespread inoculation with SV4O
will be — it may lake decades to de
termine. This example is parallel to
what is going on now with recombin
ant DNA research and in effect, led to
the current controversy.
A recent article in the Atlantic
Monthly recounts how concern over
Paul Berg's intentions to put SV4O in
E. coli, a common human intestinal
bacterium, led to Berg's initial call for
a moratorium on this sort of research,
and later to the Asilomar conference
where various restrictions on research
were advocated.
The NIH guidelines with which all
federally funded researchers must
comply are a more recent develop
ment. Those wary of recombinant re
search feel these guidelines are not
sufficient in a number of ways: they do
not regulate private industry, they re
quire no effective monitoring for the
spread of disease and they do not take
the occurences of earthquakes into ac
count when regulating the construc
tion of lab facilities.
The citizens of Cambridge, Mass.
concerned about similar things called
for a moratorium on recombinant re
search at MIT and Harvard while they

Susan Green

studied the issue and drew up tougher
regulations to protect the health of
Cambridge citizens.
In California, there is currently a bill
before the state legislature which
would provide stricter regulation than
theNIH guidelines. Community action
is still vital in order to make people
realize that they can exercise respon
sible control over scientific research
conducted in their own area.
The individuals and groups at Stan
ford calling for a moratorium on re
combinant research are not acting irra
tionally or in ignorance, but on the
basis of others' experience and out of
concern for their community.
The Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) is following the footsteps of
others like the Cambridge citizens.
What Hansch and others call for is
exactly that "cooperative spirit of the
705." As with many issues in the past,
public sentiment has not met with
much cooperation when it challenges
existing authority on the grounds of
moral responsibility.

the occurences of earthquakes into ac

From the content of Allan Chen's
reply (Daily, Mar. 4) to Steve Hansch's
column on recombinant DNA re
search, one wonders if Chen has some
thing to gain personally from this re
search or if he merely enjoys making
public statements which show his own
ignorance and shortsightedness.
Most of Chen's "vocal minority" are
not acting out of "irrational fear and
ignorance," but are people who have
taken the time to research the issue, to
meet with others who are equally con
cerned, and to publicize what they feel
to be some of the most potentially
harmful scientific experiments being
conducted today.
The question being asked is whether

or not decisions concerning public
health risks from publicly funded re
search (and from private research —
the dangers are just as great) should be
left entirely up to the scientific com
munity.
Is science existing in a vacuum or
does it exist to serve the people? If the
latter is true, which I suspect most
funding requests seek to show, then
the public should have a larger role in
deciding what is to be studied and in
what manner.
Chen seems to be unaware of the his
tory behind the formulation of the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH)
guidelines. In the 19605, scientists
working with simian virus 40, (SV4O),
e tumor virus which causes human
cells in vitro to act cancerous, thought
it to be incapable of causing human
disease. The virus was an unrecog
nized contaminant of polio vaccines
and some cold shots before 1962.
Since Nixon's "war" on cancer
however, a good deal of the funding for
cancer research has gone to support
the study of these viruses. No one
knows what the consequences of
widespread inoculation with SV4O
will be — it may lake decades to de
termine. This example is parallel to
what is going on now with recombin
ant DNA research and in effect, led to
the current controversy.
