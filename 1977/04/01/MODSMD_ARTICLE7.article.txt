In the absence of a convenient issue
like Vietnam, one doubts that the cur
rent brouhaha about renewed campus
violence will come to anything
noteworthy. But just in case, the
mutinous youth should not delude
themselves about morality being all on
their side, even if they are fairly
numerous. In the real world, they will
eventually discover, there are often
conflicting moral viewpoints.
For example, in the Soviet Union
there is the gang morality of the party
faithful who are sure they are socially
right as they smash in the faces of dis
sidents and artists who have a differ
ing, more individualistic moral view
point.
Edgar Poe spoke of "proximate mor
ality" referring to the ordinary "mass"
sort as opposed to his own creative
kind of long-range morality. Thus a
Cezanne, who seemed hopeless in
terms of usual human relations — he
couldn't bear anyone near him —
eventually relates beautifully to al
most everyone, even in the Soviet Un
ion.
It takes a special kind of moral fiber,
a strong faith, to keep a person going in
the face of crowd hostility. Cezannes
or Poes, for the most part, we in the
University are not and, indeed, it has
been often noted, much of the flaccidi
ty of the faculties when confronted
with the last wave of student violence
can be ascribed to the fact that many
professors were overly profes
sionalized, feathering their own
specialized nests instead of attending
to the general humane education of
their students or to their own disin
terested scholarly creativity.
But Stanford, for all of its glaring
shortcomings, didn't get where it is
without a stout contingent of
generous-souled idealists. Especially
no one should misjudge the will to do
the right thing by this valuable place
on the part of President Richard Ly
man. Anyone who has known him per
sonally or dealt with him at close range
can vouch for his spiritual toughness
in the clutches.

While the Rugby Club appreciates
positive publicity concerning our ef
forts at the Monterey National Tour
nament, we do not appreciate those
efforts tainted by false reports of why
we lost our final game on Sunday.
After playing four hard games on
Saturday, the team enjoyed a dinner
party given by a Stanford alumnus in
Carmel. The team did not party "hard"
as was reported in the Daily. Indeed,
most players retired by 11 p.m., to rest
from an intense day of rugby and to be
ready to play on Sunday.
Three team members traveled back
to Palo Alto in order to fulfill overseas
commitments the next day. Excluding
them, we were ready to play, contrary
to the statement that "few members
showed up for the final game." We lost
the match simply because our oppo
nents, having five years more experi
ence per player, were better than us on
that day.
The writers of this and earlier arti
cles are obviously not informed or mis
interpret information about the Stan
ford program and what it promotes.
Rugby here encourages comraderie
among team members, game participa
tion by at least 50 students on three
teams and a chance to compete
athletically for our school.
Preparation and training for this
year's national tournament was re
warded by Stanford's best finish there
in six years. The enjoyment and satis
faction of this accomplishment felt by
our team has been diminished by an
inaccurate portrayal of our activities at
the tournament.
Rugby players here take the sport
seriously. Continuous efforts by Daily
writers to cast us into a stereotype are
detrimental to both the players and the
game itself.

Carmel. The team did not party "hard"
as was reported in the Daily. Indeed,
most players retired by 11 p.m., to rest
from an intense day of rugby and to be
ready to play on Sunday.
Three team members traveled back
to Palo Alto in order to fulfill overseas
commitments the next day. Excluding
them, we were ready to play, contrary
to the statement that "few members
showed up for the final game." We lost
the match simply because our oppo
nents, having five years more experi
ence per player, were better than us on
that day.
The writers of this and earlier arti
cles are obviously not informed or mis
interpret information about the Stan
ford program and what it promotes.
Rugby here encourages comraderie
among team members, game participa
tion by at least 50 students on three
teams and a chance to compete
athletically for our school.
Preparation and training for this
year's national tournament was re
warded by Stanford's best finish there
in six years. The enjoyment and satis
faction of this accomplishment felt by
our team has been diminished by an
inaccurate portrayal of our activities at
the tournament.
Rugby players here take the sport
seriously. Continuous efforts by Daily
writers to cast us into a stereotype are
detrimental to both the players and the
game itself.

In the absence of a convenient issue
like Vietnam, one doubts that the cur
rent brouhaha about renewed campus
violence will come to anything
noteworthy. But just in case, the
mutinous youth should not delude
themselves about morality being all on
their side, even if they are fairly
numerous. In the real world, they will
eventually discover, there are often
conflicting moral viewpoints.
For example, in the Soviet Union
there is the gang morality of the party
faithful who are sure they are socially
right as they smash in the faces of dis
sidents and artists who have a differ
ing, more individualistic moral view
point.
Edgar Poe spoke of "proximate mor
ality" referring to the ordinary "mass"
sort as opposed to his own creative
kind of long-range morality. Thus a
Cezanne, who seemed hopeless in
terms of usual human relations — he
couldn't bear anyone near him —
eventually relates beautifully to al
most everyone, even in the Soviet Un
ion.
It takes a special kind of moral fiber,
a strong faith, to keep a person going in
the face of crowd hostility. Cezannes
or Poes, for the most part, we in the
University are not and, indeed, it has
been often noted, much of the flaccidi
ty of the faculties when confronted
with the last wave of student violence
can be ascribed to the fact that many
professors were overly profes
sionalized, feathering their own
specialized nests instead of attending
to the general humane education of
their students or to their own disin
terested scholarly creativity.
But Stanford, for all of its glaring
shortcomings, didn't get where it is
without a stout contingent of
generous-souled idealists. Especially
no one should misjudge the will to do
the right thing by this valuable place
on the part of President Richard Ly
man. Anyone who has known him per
sonally or dealt with him at close range
can vouch for his spiritual toughness
in the clutches.
