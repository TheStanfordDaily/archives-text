# A 						revolutionary primer

Robert Rosenzweig

I was really relieved to learn from
the column by Hansch and Moonshine
(Daily, Mar. 28) that the revolution
will come to Stanford. My friends and I
have been very worried that the re
volution was going to pass us by. It's
like those new movies that play for
months in San Francisco before they
arrive on the Peninsula. It had begun to
seem likely that the best we could look
forward to was a second-run revolu
tion.
Indeed, I was at a dinner party re
cently where the main topic of conver
sation was whether Stanford is not
worthy of a revolution or is too worthy
to need one. And which explanation is
the more flattering.
Well, all that is behind us now, and
we can look forward to the coming of
the revolution. But it occurs to me that
most of the people now at Stanford,
and virtually all of the students, mis
sed the last revolution and have only
book-learning to guide their expecta
tions and their behavior. Books are
good for some things, maybe, but
when it comes to revolution, there is

nothing like the voice of experience.
As a service to the community, and in
an entirely non-partisan spirit, I wish
to offer a few of the things I learned
from the last revolution.
1) Revolutions almost always start in
the spring. It is a serious error to do
otherwise. It is obvious in retrospect
that it was a major strategic blunder to
have announced the start of the
American Revolution in July. The hot
summer weather in the East saps
people's revolutionary zeal and makes
it very hard to attract crowds to plan
ned spontaneous events. And only a
real hard-head like Lenin would have
started the Russian Revolution at the
height of the football season. If
Kerensky hadn't panicked and can
celed the Leningrad schedule, the Bol
sheviks could have been in serious
trouble.
2) Revolutionaries must learn by
heart the battle cry of 20th century re
volutions: You can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs (sometimes
pronounced "heads"). The motto is

equally true for souffles, but it is al
ways omelets that revolutionaries are
making. I guess they don't like souf
fles.
3) Revolutions must always be made
against the nearest available oppres
sor. Parents are especially good, but if
they are not available, then schools
will do almost as well. In the case of
the latter an especially effective tactic
is to close down the classes for which
one's parents — either in taxes or tui
tion — are paying a great deal of
money. Talk about making omelets!
4) Revolutions are not funny. On the
contrary, they are grim, solemn,
pompous, self-righteous, humorless
affairs. To the true revolutionary, that
is not a problem because those qual
ities come naturally. For those who are
just learning revolution, however,
they require practice and discipline.
So, lay on, you revolutionaries, and
damned be him that first cracks a
smile.
