# ASSU salary debate

As the sponsor of the ASSU con
stitutional amendment which puts the
salaries of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents (COP) and senate officials to a fee
assessment vote each year, I have the
indignant responsibility of clearing up
the "murky" situation created in John
Paval's opinions column (Daily,
March 30). I will attempt to be sparing
in my comments.
Paval states that "the by-law is un
constitutional for two reasons": the
vote in the senate and the method by
which it got to the senate. False. The
constitution states that a three-fifths
majority of the senate is required to
pass a bylaw. The chairman of the se
nate ruled (and was upheld in his deci
sion by the senate) that this meant
three-fifths of all those present and
voting, an abstention not counting as a
cast vote.
The bylaw passed 11-4, winning
73.3 per cent of the vote. This vote was
clearly more than the 60 per cent re
quired.

Second, the Bylaws Committee
which reviewed the bylaw has nothing
to do with the constitutionality of its
subsequent passage. (I am also hon
ored to know that my mere presence at
a committee meeting shatters any
"pretense of objectivity.")
Paval concludes then, that "this
bylaw (the "Morrow Amendment")
was rammed through the senate." The
so-called "Morrow Amendment" was
the result of more senate discussion
and non-senate consultation than any
other piece of legislation this year.
Paval states that the "Morrow
Amendment" ".. . discourages minor
ity students, low/moderate income
students, and graduate students from
running for office." This is unfounded.
However, to counter any possible "de
terrent effect" a provision is included
in the bylaw which provides that if the
fee assessment fails . . those new
COP members who feel the need for
financial aid shall be entitled to a
stipend provided out of the ASSU

funds. The amount shall be less than or
equal to $750 a quarter. The senate
shall act on the recommendation of the
financial aids office in granting such a
stipend."
This provision should eliminate the
fear among COP contenders that they
will not be able to stomach the job fi
nancially if the fee assessment fails.
Finally, Paval states that "subjecting
the COP salaries to a vote suggests that
the COP does not objectively deserve
to be paid for its efforts." On the con
trary, the bill makes no such value
judgment.
This bylaw continues the attempt of
several fellow senators and myself to
"create a sense of financial responsi
bility" to students. This bylaw gives
the student the right to determine, for
himself, if the COP objectively de
serves to be paid with his money for its
efforts.
