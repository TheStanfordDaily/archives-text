# ASSU Senate to consider internal reforms
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
The ASSU Senate will vote tonight
on whether to adopt reforms called for
by a SWOPSI class last quarter.
The proposed reforms would:
— make the Council of Presidents
(COP) four copresidents rather than a
president and three vice presidents;
— delegate a member of the COP to
chair the senate;
— reorganize the existing senate
committees; and
— place non-elected students on se
nate committees.
The reforms have been proposed by
class members of "The Role of Stu
dents in University Covernance" led
by Carole Houck, ASSU vice presi
dent.
Houck's class recommended the
COP should be changed from a council
consisting of copresidents because it
felt this would ensure "all four COP
members were equally interested and
involved," said Houck.
Sen. Doug Bandow said his only ob
jection to this reform is that "it's gen
erally nice to have someone in charge.
I'm not heavily against the proposed
change," he said, but it did bother him
that no one person could "take the
flack or be held accountable."
Sen. Brad krevoy, on the other hand,
said the proposed change is "great.
The responsibilities of the COP are so

vast," he explained, "that by dividing
the duties among four copresidents,
the duties would be more adequately
covered.
"I believe so strongly in a copresi
dent COP," he added, "that the COP
slate I'm running on is set up as a
council of copresidents."
Under the current system, a COP
slate may be composed of one person
who is really interested and three
others he got to run with him,
explained Houck.
According to Houck, her class re
commended a member of the COP be
chairperson of the senate because it
felt "a definite need to make a more
formal tie between the two bodies.
Right now the COP can basically do
what they want; when the senate runs
into problems the COP can just let
them handle it themselves."
Houck said she didn't like the cur
rent possibility of the two bodies work
ing against each other.
The class also recommended the se
nate establish four standing commit
tees: an Academic Affairs Committee,
a Committee on Committees, a Finance
Committee (FC), and a Rules Commit
tee (RC) with specific duties outlined
for each.
Although an FC and RC presently
exist, said Houck, their jobs are nebul
ously described and none (with the ex

ception of the FC) accomplish very
much. According to Houck, assigning
committees specific duties would up
grade the quality of performance.
The reforms also seek non-elected
student committee members. By open
ing t he committees to students at large,
said Houck, the government would
become less elitist and would provide
a wider base of student input.
While Krevoy approved of this re
form. saying non-elected members

would provide "a fresh perspective,"
Bandow said he was "very much
against it."
Bandow said while the electoral
process was not perfect, it was "more
responsive to student concerns than
students themselves." Non-elected
committee members will just "put
another layer" between the students
and government, he claimed. "There's
the danger that you'd have a lot less
accountability."

The reforms have been proposed by
class members of "The Role of Stu
dents in University Covernance" led
by Carole Houck, ASSU vice presi
dent.
Houck's class recommended the
COP should be changed from a council
consisting of copresidents because it
felt this would ensure "all four COP
members were equally interested and
involved," said Houck.
Sen. Doug Bandow said his only ob
jection to this reform is that "it's gen
erally nice to have someone in charge.
I'm not heavily against the proposed
change," he said, but it did bother him
that no one person could "take the
flack or be held accountable."
Sen. Brad krevoy, on the other hand,
said the proposed change is "great.
The responsibilities of the COP are so

vast," he explained, "that by dividing
the duties among four copresidents,
the duties would be more adequately
covered.
"I believe so strongly in a copresi
dent COP," he added, "that the COP
slate I'm running on is set up as a
council of copresidents."
Under the current system, a COP
slate may be composed of one person
who is really interested and three
others he got to run with him,
explained Houck.
According to Houck, her class re
commended a member of the COP be
chairperson of the senate because it
felt "a definite need to make a more
formal tie between the two bodies.
Right now the COP can basically do
what they want; when the senate runs
into problems the COP can just let
them handle it themselves."
Houck said she didn't like the cur
rent possibility of the two bodies work
ing against each other.
The class also recommended the se
nate establish four standing commit
tees: an Academic Affairs Committee,
a Committee on Committees, a Finance
Committee (FC), and a Rules Commit
tee (RC) with specific duties outlined
for each.
Although an FC and RC presently
exist, said Houck, their jobs are nebul
ously described and none (with the ex

ception of the FC) accomplish very
much. According to Houck, assigning
committees specific duties would up
grade the quality of performance.
The reforms also seek non-elected
student committee members. By open
ing t he committees to students at large,
said Houck, the government would
become less elitist and would provide
a wider base of student input.
While Krevoy approved of this re
form. saying non-elected members

would provide "a fresh perspective,"
Bandow said he was "very much
against it."
Bandow said while the electoral
process was not perfect, it was "more
responsive to student concerns than
students themselves." Non-elected
committee members will just "put
another layer" between the students
and government, he claimed. "There's
the danger that you'd have a lot less
accountability."

The ASSU Senate will vote tonight
on whether to adopt reforms called for
by a SWOPSI class last quarter.
The proposed reforms would:
— make the Council of Presidents
(COP) four copresidents rather than a
president and three vice presidents;
— delegate a member of the COP to
chair the senate;
— reorganize the existing senate
committees; and
— place non-elected students on se
