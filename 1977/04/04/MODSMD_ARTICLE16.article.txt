# Hotels, restaurants cut back to handle drought
##

San Francisco (AP) — They don't
give you water anymore when you sit
down for a meal at the Shamrock
Chh.ese Restaurant.
Charlie Kwong, proprietor of the res
taurant, said that no water is served
unless a customer specifically requests
it. He gave the drought as the reason.
In fact, the city — with half its nor
mal rainfall this season — would be
grateful if tourists, while leaving their
hearts here, could drop off a glass or
two of water before going home.
In case it has escaped notice, we're
in the parched grip of a two-year
drought, and operation strangle is
under way for every sink spigot, toilet
tank, shower head and bathtub in San
Francisco.
Impelled hy one of the worst water
shortages in history, every water user
in the city — which means everybody
— has been ordered to cut consump
tion by 25 per cent of the same period
last year.
The rationing order ignited feverish
water-saving activity in the city's 2026
bars, more than 2600 restaurants and
126 tourist motels and hotels which
host 2.2 million visitors a year.
At the Hyatt Regency, signs for the
bathroom are in preparation which
will inform guests they can save 26

gallons by taking "wetdown" show
ers; that it is possible to take a bath in
two inches of water; that 9V 2 gallons
may be saved by using a glass of water
to brush teeth; that five to seven gal
lons goes down the tubes with every
flush.
Plastic bottles have been installed in
all toilet tanks, along with water re
striction gadgets in shower heads and
water-cutting faucets in the bars.
At the TraveLodge on motel row,
proprietor Ron Fahlgren beamed at a
damming device installed in a toilet
tank.
"It saves 50 per cent," he said, not
ing also that new shower head restric
tors mean a good water saving as well.
At the St. Francis Hotel lobby, Dave
Bellman of Bloomfield, N.J., was tell
ing friends about his trouble getting a
glass of water, of all things. Said he:
"I was at this banquet here, see and
the strangest thing happened to ine. I
kept ordering a glass of water, see. and
I had all this trouble getting it. Finally,
I had to request the glass of water for
cibly from the waiter. Only then did I
get the damned thing."
Clift Hotel chief engineer Martin
Wadawitz noted that the time of a
toilet flush in 400 bathrooms has been
cut from eight seconds to five, for a

savings of up to two gallons a flush.
But Wadowitz is worried, along
with other large hotels, about how
much water-saving cooperation they
can expect from high-paying guests.
"If the guest wants to fill the
bathtub, he fills it up, whereas you or 1
could get along on half a tub," he said.
No less concerned is Robert Sulli
van, director of the San Francisco Vis
itors and Convention Bureau.
"We're all trying to educate the con
vention delegates in advance to go
easy on the water when they get here,
while at the same time telling them the
water shortage won't prevent them
from having a good holiday," he said.
At the St. Francis, tourist Gail Ro
senthal of Philadelphia thought "it's
awfully green around here for a
drought, isn't it?" She's not con
vinced.
But Millie Facciolo of Pittsburgh,
Pa., at the Hilton, said she recognized
the problem.
"Don't worry," she said, "folks like
me will be willing to go along with
water conservation measures. It's
worth it to be here."
One business without worries about
the drought is the Red Desert shop,
which sells cactus plants that need
watering once a month.
