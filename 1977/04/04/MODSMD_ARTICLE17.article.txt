Los Angeles (AP) — President
Carter's silence on "waffling" by
the Secretary of Heath, Educa
tion and Welfare on minority
hiring casts doubt on Carter's
commitment to civil rights, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson said Sunday.
Jackson claimed that HEW
Secretary Joseph Califano was
backing down on minority hir
ing quotas and on admission of
blacks and women into univer
sities.
In an interview two weeks ago,
Califano advocated quotas as an
effective means of reversing dis
crimination. But Thursday the
New York Times quoted
Califano as saying he'd made a
mistake in endorsing quotas.
"Mr. Califano's waffling on
this issue reflects mismanage
ment, adds to the confusion and
indicates uncertain leadership,"
Jackson said in an interview.
The secretary changed his
stance after 44 educators from
leading universities sent a letter

calling on Carter to repudiate
Califano's support of quotas.
"He's trying to please too
many people," said Jackson, ad
ding that he wants Califano to
"reaffirm his original commit
ment to affirmative action."
"By his own words he
(Califano), said the only way af
firmative action works is to set
numerical goals," Jackson said.
Jackson of Chicago, who is
chairman of Operation PUSH
(People United To Save Human
ity), said Carter's silence on the
issue indicates acquiescence.
