## Symphony/andrew m. moravcsik Schubert, Strauss at Symphony 
### 
Guest conductor Klaus
Tennstedt led the San Francisco
Symphony in a concert of Vien
nese music last week, featuring
the works of Strauss and
Schubert. This all-orchestral
performance presented two dis
parate and paradoxical pieces —
a heroic symphony by a gentle
lyricist and a modest little suite
of incidental music by an expan
sive Nietzschean.
Franz Schubert is the poet of
composers; his transparently
beautiful melodies and unas
suming yet inspired lyricism are
unmatched in the world of
music. However, unlike his con
temporary, Beethoven (who de
lighted in monumental struc
tures), he is not an architect.
With Schubert, the smaller the
form, the greater his talent. His
songs for voice and piano are un
surpassed; his chamber music
ranks with that of Mozart and
Beethoven; and his early
chamber symphonies (as well as
the Unfinished) are subtle yet
simple.
A few years before his tragi
cally early death at 31, Schubert
decided to translate his admira
tion for Beethoven into a "grand
symphony" — and so the great C
Major was born. Unfortunately,
Schubert had not experienced
Beethoven's prodigious organic
development (both musically
and spiritually) from the First to
the Ninth symphonies, and at
tempted to write a Beethovenes
que work based on his wholly
discrepant background. It was a
noble effort, but the result was
mediocre at best.
The symphony as a bridge
Schubert never realized that a
great symphony is like a bridge.
Although the detail of a bridge is
important, its unique function is
to transport people from one
place to another. Other musical
forms can describe moods and
draw pictures; only a symphony
can instruct as well as inform —
and therein lies its great power.
The symphonic ideal is a
polished arch, rising up from its
opening and communicating
gr/eat emotion — completely
self-contained and yet able to
move the audience. Such a struc
ture cannot be created by inspi
ration alone; unlike simpler
works, it must be constructed,
piece by piece.
Thus, though Schubert's C
Major Symphony is rich in de
tail, it almost collapses under its
own weight. Admittedly, certain
facets are brilliant: the in

strumentation is bold, not until
Bruckner would such a powerful
rustic scherzo be penned, and
the symphony abounds in clever
detail, such as the scarcely hid
den quotation from BeethoVen's
Ninth in the last movement.
Despite all this, it is hollow,
repetitive and pretentious. Most
importantly, the structure is
grotesquely proportioned,
enormous yet weak and affected
— a maimed giant. With any
thing but the most inspired ren
dering, this great work can drag
its length upon the ground —
boring both audience and musi
cians.
Happily, Tennstedt did almost
everything possible to infuse life
into the work. His tempi were
lively, while he made up for the
lost Schubertian lyricism in his
phrasing. Drawing a clean bright
sound out of the orchestra, he
accentuated the dynamics to the
edge of overemphasis, using
crescendos to span weak sec
tions.
Sonorous trombones
The orchestra rose to the occa
sion. The trombones were
sonorous, the strings were crisp,
and the horns limited their cus
tomary incompetence to minor
intonation problems. The coda

to the first movement was grip
ping and powerful, while
Tennstedt resisting the tempta
tion to exaggerate the scherzo, as
many conductors do.
However, the second move
ment struck Tennstedt in his
Achilles heel. This yearning an
dante, probably the best move
ment in the symphony (and cer
tainly the most "Schubertian"),
features continuous woodwind
solos. Tennstedt's earlier educa
tion as a concert violinist was
evident as he lavished attention
on relatively insignificant string
accompaniment while crucial
woodwind solos were languish
ing — lost, weak and completely
without musical feeling.
One final note: Schubert wrote
a unique decrescendo on the last
chord (instead of the expected
booming cadence as in Beeth
oven). I see it as a final assertion
of individuality in an unindi
vidualistic piece. Most conduc
tors ignore this idiosyncracy but
Tennstedt interpreted it per
fectly.
In contrast to the Schubert
symphony, Richard Strauss'
Bourgeois Gentilhomme Suite is
an unassuming little chamber
work. Unlike his heroic tone
pooms, it is light, merry and

gently parodistic. Every detail of
the scenes are included, right
down to the birds on the dinner
table.
No baton
Tennstedt did not use a baton
in conducting the modest or
chestra (18 strings and a smatter
ing of winds and precussion), a
practice he normally reserves for
concerti. A quiet and exquisitely
balanced baroque style resulted.
The pianissimos were the fi nest I
have heard from the Symphony
this year, especially in the vio
lins.
However, I did miss the re
cklessness of the previous
week's I'rokofiev. The refined
performance, although beauti
ful, tended to blunt the parody,
especially in the fast move
ments. Moliere's fencing master
was not as brash as one would
like and the minuet certainly
was not playful, as Strauss him
self directs.
The correct spirit was cap
tured by Stuart Canin, the con
certmaster. The inner move
ments of the suite form a mini
concerto for violin, which Canin
interpreted tastefully but with a
silly energy — just like Moliere's
bourgeois trying to be a gentle
man.
