# 'Black Sunday' director talks about new film
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
The film director has little
patience with the trivial ques
tions the journalists offer
him. His voice rises in vol
ume and intensity when he
pounces upon a subject or a
point he wishes to em
phasize. More often, though,
his words are quiet in tone.
The man is John Fran
kenheimer, who directed
Seven Days In May and The
Munchurinn Candidate. The
film under discussion is
Ulack Sunday, the story of a
planned Black September at
tack upon the Super Bowl
from the Goodyear blimp.
The trivialities include how
Michael Lander (Bruce Dem)
was able to plant bombs and
avoid security precautions as
easily as he did.
Frankenheimer responded
to the question of incon
gruities with a director's ap
lomb. "The way I feel about it
is—why didn't they call the
Coast Guard in Jaws? Drop a
bloody depth charge on the
shark, and the movie would
be over! Explain to me how
Robert Donat got out of the
police station in The Thirty-
Nine Steps."
Asked how and where cer
tain sequences were filmed,
he answered quickly, "I don't

think it's anybody's business
where things were done or
how things were done. I see
myself as a combination
story-teller and magician. I
pull rabbits out of the hat."
Frankenheimer's
background in live television
helped considerably in the
execution of the climactic
scenes filmed at the Super
Howl. He said the key to suc
cess was preparation — how
to function under pressure,
how to improvise when
something goes awry, and
making sure everyone knows
what they're doing before
they do it.
The crew shot scenes
quickly and efficiently, ac
cording to previous direc
tions.
Since crowds tended to
gather near a camera, Fran
kenheimer remarked, scenes
were shot quickly.
The director joked, "If I'd
had Robert Redford in there, I
would have had a problem."
One person accidentally
drove into camera range, so
the company had to rent his
car for four days of matching
scenes, during which he was
chauffeured to work in a
company limousine. He was a
cook at McDonald's.
