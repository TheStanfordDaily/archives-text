# Campus issues prompt SWOPSI courses

Tenure. Western Civ requirement
reinstated. Stanford abstains vote on
second J.P. Stevens Stockholders'
proposal. Berlin campus dropped.
Androgyny theme house approved.
You probably recognize these as to
pics of much debate, a White Plaza
rally, a sit-in and a Council of Presi
dents (COP) task force report.
Now they are also provi di ng t he sub
ject material for four SWOPSI courses
offered this quarter: "Strategies for
Change at Stanford," "Student Influ
ence and Education," "The University
as Institutional Investor" and "An
drogyny House." And English class
"Why Do You Think That Way?" is
also being promoted by SWOPSI.
Why do you think that way?
Eight graduate students, dissatisfied
with the "fragmented view of the
world" which they feel education here
fosters, have responded with a course
entitled "Why Do You Think That
Way? Work, Sex, Change."
Asking a barrage of bold questions

ranging from "Why do you think Stan
ford's so expensive" to "Why do you
think Nixon made Watergate," this
course will explore topics such as
sexism, capitalism, racism, ecology
and the politics of medicine.
"Education at Stanford is
specialized and often narrow . . . we
are learning not to ask questions about
what we are learning," the eight
course leaders state in the course syl
labus. Enrolling nearly 100 students,
leader Carol Sternhell said she feels
the large turnout shows that many un
dergraduates share the instructors
feel ins.
This course, the eight wrote, will be
one where "we learn re-vision, learn to
see what we've previously thought of
as 'natural' or invisible."
Corporate responsibility
The J.P. Stevens issue provoked
much student concern over the moral
dimension of the University's ties with
the corporate world.
"The University as an Institutional
Investor: Ethics and Profits," is "more

than just a course fashioned after the
interests of its instructors," explained
Larry Litvak, one of its three leaders.
"It is a response to this student con
cern brought out by the J.P. Stevens
issue," he said.
Also led by senior Peter Necar
sulmer and alumnus Steve Vettel, the
course will study the issues of social
responsibility in investment
decision-making, and the relationship
between shareholders and the student
community.
It will also examine and critique the
University's investments in South Af
rica and Chile. At the end of the quar
ter, the students' research will be pub
lished in a booklet.
The class will also issue position
papers on upcoming proxy issues fac
ing the University this spring.
Strategies for Change at Stanford
"Strategies for Change at Stanford"
seeks to institute change more im
mediately and effectively, and to in
volve more students in student gov
ernment, stated co-leader Steve

Buckley, a junior.
"In the past," Buckley said, "the re
search and groundwork have been
done, but changes haven't been im
plemented." To alleviate this chronic
problem, student teams will research
policy areas of their choice, such as
housing, overseas studies, parking and
funding of student services.
Buckely and Brad Krevoy, the other
instructor, intend to supplement this
Stanford-oriented coursework with
historical perspectives of American
student movements.
Student influence
Another course, "Student Influence
and Education: Western Civ and Te
nure," also responds to the problem of
limited student participation in
decision-making processes, according
to instructors Greg Larson and Steven
Westley. Somewhat narrower than
"Strategies for Change," it will explore
tenure decisions and mandatory
course requirements in depth.
Coursework involves studying
power structure and documents such
as the COP Tenure and Teaching Qual
ity Task Force report. Students then
will develop, implement and pub
licize a proposal for successful student
involvement in University decision
making.
Larson said "If a White Plaza rally
and sit-in was the most effective way to
get the administration's approval on a
student-supported issue, then that is
what we'd support.
"But for educational issues, such as
tenure and Western Civ, I believe there
are more effective ways for students to
influence the quality of their educa
tion," he said.
Androgyny House
The "Androgyny House" class, de
signed to establish the framework for
the theme house, will attempt to define
residential education, according to
one of its leaders, junior Carla Lupi.
"This University has no definition of
residential education." Lupi said.
Specifically, this course led by Lupi.
Karen Cohn and Jim Lutz will focus on
issues of the feminist/humanist ideol
ogy, analyze the logistics of "making
the house work," and examine An
drogyny's role as a "social catalyst"
here.
