## Netters lose to UCLA, USC 
### Jill Lieber 
"We got crunched on,"
sophomore John Rast, No. 4 on
the Cards' tennis ladder, said.
"I don't know what the heck
went wrong," said Matt Mitch
ell, then man in the top spot on
the team.
"We all were trying to figure it
out. We just couldn't put our
finger on it," Rast said. "I have
never seen so many guys on our
team do so poorly. 1 don't think
our team can play that poorly
again."
It was just one disappointment
after another all weekend. The
Cards lost their opening confer
ence matches against UCLA and
USC by identical scores of 6-3.
The players' performances "flip
flopped" between singles and

doubles and between teams. It
was up and down for everyone.
And it was frustrating.
Matt Mitchell lost his first col
legiate match of the season to 'SC
star Bruce Manson, 6-2, 6-0. Bill
Maze was beaten by UCLA
freshman Van Winitsky. 6-3,6-4.
Perry Wright came down with a
sudden case of stomach flu and
couldn't team up with partner
Mitchell in the No. 1 doubles
spot.
But the team concedes it only
takes the will to win. And they
were lacking in that department.
"Player for player we were bet
ter than UCLA and USC," said
freshman Lloyd Bourne, who got
his first taste of tennis Pac-8 style
thi f s weekend. "Our will to win
has to be more intense. We were

short on motivation and inspira
tion."
Against UCLA, the nation's
top team, the Cards won two of
six singles matches and against
USC they won only one. The
doubles teams won three of the
six total matches played this
weekend.
Mitchell put away UCLA's
Tony Graham, 6-2, 6-4. The
Bruins' No. 1 man, senior cap
tain Ferdi Taygan, was recover
ing from a toe operation and did
not play.
Mitchell-Bourne teamed up
for the first time this season to
beat the Bruins' Jon Paley and
Graham at the No. 1 spot, 6-2,
6-4. Paley and Graham are usu
ally the second doubles pair on
the team.

Mitchell-Bourne beat Manson
and Chris Lewis in Saturday's
dual matches against USC, 5-7,
6-2, 6-2.
"We were forced into playing
together when Perry got sick,"
Mitchell said. "Lloyd is a big,
powerful hitter and I'm quick so
we did well together. Lloyd
played extremely well. I was
very impressed."
"The win was pretty unex
pected," Bourne said with a
chuckle. "It was a good win."
Bourne won his singles match
Friday against UCLA's Alan
Winkler, 6-4, 7-6.
"UCLA didn't look unbeata
ble, but they did look tougher
than USC," Bourne said. "Even
without Ferdi Taygan they beat
us. They are very strong."
Mitchell is still stumped about
his loss to Manson.
"I was composed and relaxed
and confident Friday against
Graham — unlike my match
with Manson," he said. "1 just
couldn't get the feel. I needed to
watch the ball a little closer."
Mitchell thinks he can beat the
Trojan star who is ranked No. 38
in the nation in men's singles.
"We've played each other
three times and he's won two out
of three," he said. "But they have
all been close.
"I thought back to last year
when the team went down south
for these matches. I didn't know
what to expect and had a lot of
pressure built up in my mind.
But this year I felt more secure. I
don't know what happened."
"UCLA has a better team than
USC," Rast said. "But we know
after seeing the teams this
weekend that no team will
dominate college tennis this
year. The top four teams are so
close — UCLA, USC, Trinity and
Stanford.
"In a way I think it was good
we lost both matches, not for our
record, but because it embarras
sed the guys on the team. It upset
us a lot. It will make the matches
up here really different. We will
really want to win."
"We're hungry now," Bourne
said.
