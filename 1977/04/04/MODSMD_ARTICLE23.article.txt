# Volleyball team sweeps three to close in on regional berth
## 
### Stacy Geiken 
Stanford's strengthened its
chances of receiving a berth in
the NCAA regionals as the Car
dinals won their sixth match in a
row by defeating Loyola in
Maples Pavilion Saturday night.
Excellent sets by Andy
Fishburn and devastating spikes

by Wendell Birkhofer helped the
Cards to take the first two games,
15-5 and 15-9.
Stanford's three-game shutout
appeared in jeopardy when the
Cards fell behind in the third
game. But a few words from Card
coach Art Lambert and some
on-court pep talks from
Fishburn rallied the Cards to a
15-10 win.
Frustrated by the strong block
ing of Rod Fletcher and Tom
Grimes, Loyola coach Fete Field
made frequent substitutions
throughout the three-game rout.
Rough match
The Cards started their long
weekend with a win over Chico
State Thursday night at Maples.
Chico was the toughest match
of the week, having beaten the
Cards earlier this season.
Despite team captain Tom
Duralde's overpowering spike
mid-game, when the Cards were
down 5-9, Stanford lost the first
game 12-15.
Card hitter Rich Rand had
trouble getting his spikes over
the net as Chico compiled a 4-11
lead in the second game.
Revived team spirit showed in
the face of setter Fishburn as the
Cards came from behind to win
again, 18-16.
The highlight of the third
game was at 10-7, when Rand
made a great dig and Birkhofer
made a powerful spike to end the
longest volley of the match.
Chico regained the ball but
could only score two more
points as the Cards won, 15-7.
Stanford won the fourth game
15-10.
"We played better and we
were able to concentrate more,"
Lambert said, when comparing
the Cards' win Thursday night to
their loss to Chico earlier in the
season.
Steady men
Lambert cited Fishburn and
Grimes as Card standouts. Lam-

Bert also praised Duralde as "al
ways steady" in play throughout
the game.
"He's our big man," Lambert
said.
Serving aces became com
monplace last Friday night as
the Cards destroyed Santa Clara
15-5, 15-7 and 15-3.
One of the line judges sum
med up the easy Card victory
when he said, "Tel 1 me when it's
close."
Lambert was optimistic about
the Cards' chances for regional
selection after their three-game
shutout Saturday night.
Regionals closer
"Our chances are certainly
enhanced," Lambert said.
Southern schools have usually
dominated the regional selec
tion roster. Lambert said he feels
that if Stanford is selected they
can play competently with the
best of them.
"I won't guarantee we'll win,
but we'll play well," Lambert
said.
Grimes, who substituted for
the injured (sprained ankle)
Rand, played well according to
Lambert.
Team effort
Grimes was happy for the
team's win and "kinda pleased"
with his performance against
Loyola.
Grimes was quick to compli
ment the rest of the team: "Nor
mally we are up and down, but
tonight we had steady, consis
tent play all the way through,"
Grimes said.
Grimes was also optimistic
about the Cards' ability to play
the top teams.
"If we played UCLA (national
champions last year) right now
we'd give them a much better
game (than their 15-12, 15-10,
15-9 loss to UCLA earlier this
season). We're playing more as a
team now. Then we were play
ing as good individuals, but not
as a team."

on-court pep talks from
Fishburn rallied the Cards to a
15-10 win.
Frustrated by the strong block
ing of Rod Fletcher and Tom
Grimes, Loyola coach Fete Field
made frequent substitutions
throughout the three-game rout.
Rough match
The Cards started their long
weekend with a win over Chico
State Thursday night at Maples.
Chico was the toughest match
of the week, having beaten the
Cards earlier this season.
Despite team captain Tom
Duralde's overpowering spike
mid-game, when the Cards were
down 5-9, Stanford lost the first
game 12-15.
Card hitter Rich Rand had
trouble getting his spikes over
the net as Chico compiled a 4-11
lead in the second game.
Revived team spirit showed in
the face of setter Fishburn as the
Cards came from behind to win
again, 18-16.
The highlight of the third
game was at 10-7, when Rand
made a great dig and Birkhofer
made a powerful spike to end the
longest volley of the match.
Chico regained the ball but
could only score two more
points as the Cards won, 15-7.
Stanford won the fourth game
15-10.
"We played better and we
were able to concentrate more,"
Lambert said, when comparing
the Cards' win Thursday night to
their loss to Chico earlier in the
season.
Steady men
Lambert cited Fishburn and
Grimes as Card standouts. Lam-

Bert also praised Duralde as "al
ways steady" in play throughout
the game.
"He's our big man," Lambert
said.
Serving aces became com
monplace last Friday night as
the Cards destroyed Santa Clara
15-5, 15-7 and 15-3.
One of the line judges sum
med up the easy Card victory
when he said, "Tel 1 me when it's
close."
Lambert was optimistic about
the Cards' chances for regional
selection after their three-game
shutout Saturday night.
Regionals closer
"Our chances are certainly
enhanced," Lambert said.
Southern schools have usually
dominated the regional selec
tion roster. Lambert said he feels
that if Stanford is selected they
can play competently with the
best of them.
"I won't guarantee we'll win,
but we'll play well," Lambert
said.
Grimes, who substituted for
the injured (sprained ankle)
Rand, played well according to
Lambert.
Team effort
Grimes was happy for the
team's win and "kinda pleased"
with his performance against
Loyola.
Grimes was quick to compli
ment the rest of the team: "Nor
mally we are up and down, but
tonight we had steady, consis
tent play all the way through,"
Grimes said.
Grimes was also optimistic
about the Cards' ability to play
the top teams.
"If we played UCLA (national
champions last year) right now
we'd give them a much better
game (than their 15-12, 15-10,
15-9 loss to UCLA earlier this
season). We're playing more as a
team now. Then we were play
ing as good individuals, but not
as a team."
