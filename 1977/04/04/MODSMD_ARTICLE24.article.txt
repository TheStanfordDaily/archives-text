# Cardinals down UOP for Spartan baseball title
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Led by the outstanding hitting of Pepe Hinojosa
and Gary Pitchford, the Stanford Cardinals beat the
University of Pacific, 15-6, in the championship
game of the San Jose State Spartan Basebal 1 Classic
in San Jose Saturday night.
After losing a disappointing 8-6 contest to de
fending NCAA champion Arizona Friday night,
senior left-hander John Yandle paced the Cards to
their 35th victory of the season (against nine los
ses), lasting the full nine innings against UOP,
giving up 13 hits and striking out 11 batters.
Stanford totaled 22 of the 35 hits in the 3V2-hour
slugfest, a tournament record, with Pitchford
going five-for-five with one RBI and Hinojosa
going four-for-five with three RBIs.
The title game got off to a fast start with Stanford
scoring three runs in the top half of the first inning
and UOP replying with two in the bottom half. But
the game slowed considerably in the following
innings, broken only by pitching changes and a
controversial call.
In the third inning Pitchford doubled down the
third base line bringing Mike Codiroli home from
second base. UOP appealed at third, claiming
Codiroli failed to touch the base on his way to the
plate.
The homeplate umpire ruled Codiroli out at
third, discounting the run and bringing Stanford
coach Mark Marquess out of the dugout to question

the umpire's jurisdiction to make the call at third.
After a lengthy and heated debate in which Mar
quess called for the third base umpire to make the
ruling, the umpire stood firm and disallowed
Codiroli's run.
In the fifth inning the Cards opened up for seven
runs on five hits to put the game out of reach. Four
walks, a single by Codiroli and RBI singles by
Pitchford, Dave Perez, Gary Scott, Hinojosa and
Kevin Triggs accounted for the inning's scoring.
Yandle, Pitchford and Hinojosa were all named
to the All-Tournament team in the ceremony fol
lowing the championship game and Hinojosa
made a clean sweep of the other tournament
awards. The junior outfielder earned the Top Bat
ter, "Charlie Hustle" and Most Valuable Player
awards for his excellent play.
