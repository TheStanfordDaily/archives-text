# UCLA 98, Stanford 55
## Bruins run down Card cindermen 
### Bruce Anderson 
The UCLA track team swept
four individual events and both
relays on its way to a 98-55 drub
bing of Stanford Saturday at
Drake Stadium in Los Angeles.
The Bruins shut the Cardinals
out in the 400-meter dash, the
800-meter run, the 110-meter
high hurdles and the pole vault
(Stanford has no vaulters) to
shatter any illusions the Cards
had of upsetting UCLA and end
ing the Bruins' 12-year string of
dual meet wins in the
Stanford-UCLA series.
Equally devastating to Card
hopes of upending the Bruins
was the loss of both relays, par
ticularly the 400-meter relay
early in the meet when the Cards
had a small lead coming into the
last leg only to botch the baton
exchange.
Marvin Holmes, James Lofton
and Gordon Banks blazed
through the first three legs and
as Banks came out of the turn
and onto the home straight, the
Cards had a slight edge.
Coaching error
But the exchange between
Banks and anchorman Alan
Sheats never transpired when
Sheats turned his head to look
back at Banks just before the
handoff.
"You can't look around on an
exchange," Stanford coach
Payton Jordan said after the
meet. "You've got to look
straight ahead once you come
out of your start and begin run
ning.
"Looking around changes the
position of your hand and puts it
out of position to receive the ba
ton. The bad pass was lack of
emphasis from the coach; it was
a coaching mistake."
Long jumper Lofton, who had
not taken any jumps prior to the
relay, returned to the jumping
area winded and under the pres
sure of the relay loss.
The 6-foot-3 junior leaped
25-OVi, but trailed Uclan Willie
Banks' 25-4. Lofton fouled on
three straight jumps and had to
skip the 400-meter dash when he
didn't have a chance to warm up
for it.
Lofton beaten
Finally, on his last jump Lof
ton leaped 25-8 to take the lead.
Banks bounded down the run
way and jumped 25-9V2 to the
raucous approval of the home
crowd. For Lofton, it was the first
dual-meet loss in two seasons.
Lofton came back to win the
200-meters in 21.0. Teammate
Banks finished second in 21.2.
Earlier in the meet Banks won
the 100-meters in 10.63 by
sprinting past a field which in
cluded Olympic hurdler James
Owens.
Top frosh sprinter
"I felt like I couldn't be
beaten," Banks said. "As I stood
in the blocks 1 realized I was
going to cross the tape first."
Banks holds the Stanford frosh
marks for the 100- and 200-
meters and indicated Saturday
there's one more frosh mark he'd
like to get.
"1 may ask coach Jordan if I
can run a 400 next week to go
after Jim Ward's record (for
440-yards) of 47.5," Banks said.
Although he hasn't run an open
400 this year, the Los Angeles

freshman recorded a 47.4 split in
a mile relay at the Stanford Invi
tational.
While Banks contemplated
the sole frosh sprint record he
has yet to acquire, a pair of
freshmen steeplechasers shat
tered the Stanford frosh steeple
mark.
Bill Haldeman and Bill Gail,
neither of whom had ever run
the steeplechase before this sea
son, came from behind with
strong finishes to place one-two
in 9:06.7 and 9:09.4, respec
tively. Both eclipsed Stacy
Geiken's two— year— old
freshman standard of 9:11.4.
Javelin thrower Ricky Brown,
also a freshman, won his event
by tossing the eight-foot spear
202-2
And while strong perfor

mances by Stanford freshmen
portend a bright future for Card
cindermen, seniors Terry Albrit
ton, Steve Crowley and Jeff
Parietti demonstrated that vete
rans still make up the backbone
of the team.
Albritton put the shot 64-0 to
set a meet and Stanford outdoor
record.
Crowley, still fighting linger
ing effects of Montezuma's Re
venge after the team trip to
Mexico City, won the 15-meters
in 3:52.5.
Parietti won the 5000-meters
in 14:36.9, while Stanford
sophomore Roy Kissin finished
second.

Winning pace
Senior Steve Crowley crosses the finish line victorious in a meet
against Hayward State earlier in the season. Crowley was up to
his winning ways again Saturday, taking first in the 1500-meter
run in Stanford's 98-55 loss to UCLA. His 3:52.5 clocking against
the Bruins tied the meet record set by teammate Jeff Parietti last
season.
