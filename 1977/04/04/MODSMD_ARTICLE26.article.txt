weekend's win was the most in
spiring of all.
"1 guess we are now the best
team in the West," said at
tackman Greg Hoberg. The tour
ney bbasted teams from
Washington, Oregon, Arizona,
Los Angeles and the Bay Area.
"We broke San Francisco's 39

game winning streak," he said.
"Everyone played his best
game."
Pre-tourney game favorite San
Francisco sported players who
averaged 27 years of age. All
played powerful East Coast lac
rosse and a few were Ail-

San Francisco broke into an
early lead and the score
seesawed throughout the game.
Then the Cards poured it on

thanks to fine goal keeping of
Bing Gordon who had several
key saves.
Another key player in the win
was Joe Stratton who had three
goals. Larry Wexler also played a
fine, aggressive game.
"There were no really big
stars," Hoberg said. "We all did
well. It was a real team effort."
Stanford's next game is Satur
day against San Francisco Lac
rosse Club in San Francisco.
