Report predicts Soviet superiority
Washington — A committee led by former
officials in Democratic and Republican ad
ministrations said yesterday that "if trends
continue, the U.S.S.R. will within several years
achieve strategic superiority over the United
States."
A statement by the Committee on the Present
Danger warned that superiority in both
strategic nuclear and conventional weapons
"could enable the Soviet Union to apply deci
sive pressure on the United States" in crisis
situations.
"Soviet pressure, when supported by
strategic and conventional military superior
ity, would be aimed at forcing our general
withdrawal from a leading role in world af
fairs," the committee said.
The committee paper confined itself to dis
cussing "what the Soviet Union is up to" with
out proposing specific U.S. responses.
However, it challenged critics of large-scale
defense spending who argue it makes no sense
to pile up ever more powerful nuclear weapons
because, these critics contend, both superpow
ers already have enough to destroy each other
many times over.
"To ignore declared Soviet intentions and
demonstrated Soviet capabilities in an errone
ous conviction that we have 'enough' to defend
ourselves and that there is always 'time' to
strengthen ourselves could prove to be fatal
shortsightedness," the statement said.
"In the nuclear age 'enough' may not be
enough, and 'time' may run out unless our
efforts keep pace," it added.
Sadat to meet with Carter
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat arrived yesterday for his first meeting
with President Jimmy Carter, where he is ex
pected to set forth Arab conditions for peace in

the Middle East.
Sadat told an airport news conference before
his departure that he wanted Carter "to be ac
quainted with the nature of the problem we are
facing from our point of view because we have
a right to put our point of view before Mr.
Carter as the Israelis have. . .
Sadat's visit is the first to Washington by an
Arab leader since Carter took office last January
and is one of a series of talks aimed at reviving
the 1973 Geneva peace talks. Carter also plans
meetings in the next few weeks with King Hus
sein of Jordan, Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and President Hafez Assad of Syria.
Sadat said he found several encouraging
signs in Carter's public statements, including
his decision not to send concussion bombs to
Israel and his support of a Palestinian home
land.
During the news conference, Sadat said the
Palestinian problem remained the key to an
overall Mideast settlement. He accused the Is
raelis of trying to cloud the issue of Palestinian
representation at Geneva but said the Palesti
nians would show "very great flexibility" in
negotiations.
Uganda accident called staged
London — Three witnesses — a doctor, a
nurse and a soldier — say Anglican Ar
chbishop Janani Luwum of Uganda was shot to
death, notkilledinanautomobileaccident, the
Sunday Telegraph quoted a refugee Ugandan
bishop as saying.
The newspaper said the Right Rev. Festo
Kivengere, a black Anglican bishop, told it that
Luwum was shot dead and then run over by a
car in a staged "accident."
Luwum and two Ugandan cabinet ministers
who died with him Feb. 16 had been arrested
for allegedly plotting against Ugandan Presi
dent Idi Amin. Amin said they were killed

when the car in which they were being taken to
an interrogation session overturned when they
tried to overpower their driver.
"One of our bishops spoke to a nurse who
said she had seen the archbishop's body with
two bullet holes in his chest and blood in his
mouth," Kivengere was quoted as saying.
Bishop Kivengere, 57, of the southern Ugan
dan diocese of Kigezi, fled into neighboring
Rwanda with his wife soon after the deaths of
Luwum, Interior Minister Charles Oboth-
Ofumbi and Lands Minister Erinayo Oryema.
Atlanta mayor fires strickers
Atlanta — Mayor Maynard Jackson said yes
terday he agrees that striking city workers need
a pay raise, but he is sticking by his decision to
fire them and the city will go ahead with plans
to hire replacements beginning today.
The mayor fired more than 1000 blue collar
workers Friday after they declined to stop a
walkout which began last Monday.
The strike primarily has affected residential
garbage collection. City officials have an
nounced a plan for emergency garbage collec
tion which calls for residents to haul their own
trash to designated neighborhood sites.
Members of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employes
(AFSCME) union met Saturday and voted to
continue the strike.
They said they would try to discourage At
lanta residents from cooperating with the city's
garbage collection plan. Other workers' groups
vowed to picket city employment offices in an
effort to discourage applicants from filling the
jobs of the strikers.
Riots erupt outside Irish prison
Portlaoise, Ireland — Hundreds of Irish Re
publican Army (IRA) sympathizers fought
pitched battles with riot police outside the

Irish Republic's maximum security prison here
yesterday during a rally in support of 20 IRA
inmates staging a hunger strike.
Police said at least 60 persons, including 10
officers, were injured in the clashes, the most
violent eruption of support for the outlawed
IRA's militant "Provisional" wing in more
than a year. A spokesman said at least a dozen
rioters were arrested.
More than 1000 IRA supporters, many of
them from Northern Ireland, massed outside
the prison's main gate in this little town 45
miles west of Dublin.
The almost exclusively Roman Gatholic IRA
is fighting in Northern Ireland to end British
rule and Protestant domination of that pro
vince. They seek to unite it with the Republic.
The rally was organized by Sinn Fein, the
IRA's legal political front, in support ofthelßA
inmates in the prison who have been on hunger
strike demanding better conditions for 27 days.
Ten of the hunger strikers have been hos
pitalized in poor condition.
Police said the fighting began when 200
riot-helmeted policemen blocked the IRA sup
porters' way to the prison gates. Rioters hurled
bottles and stones and tried to force their way
through with a tractor and trailer.
Carter gets 'Pravda' blast
Moscow — The Communist newspaper
Pravda blasted the Carter administration's
arms control package yesterday, while a Hun
garian newspaper said the U.S. attitude in last
week's talks raised "a question mark with re
gard to the future of detente."
Writing in the Communist party newspaper
Pravda, Soviet commentator Mai
Podklyuchnikov said the proposals offered by
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance during his visit
to Moscow last week "did not contain any seri
ous, constructive proposals."

Pravda repeated the charge that Vance tried
to cancel the arms limitation proposals
reached three years ago at Vladivostok, and
that his proposals would have given the United
States an unfair strategic advantage.
