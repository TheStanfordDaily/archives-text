Quelimane, Mozambique (AP) — Leaders of five black
African states around Rhodesia gathered yesterday to dis
cuss military aid offered by the presidents of the Soviet
Union and Cuba for the guerrilla war against the white
regime in Rhodesia.
The aid was offered by Nikolai Podgorny of the Soviet
Union and Fidel Castro of Cuba during their recently con
cluded tours of southern Africa.
No announcement was expected yesterday from the
meeting, chaired by Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.
But observers said the talks were sure to include ways of
escalating the four-year struggle being waged in Rhodesia.
Also attending the meeting were black Rhodesian
nationalist leaders Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe,
whose Popular Front claims control over most of the guer
rillas reportedly operating in Rhodesia from bases in
neighboring Mozambique, Botswana and Zambia.
Coastal town
Nkomo and Mugabe flew to this coastal town from Lusaka
with Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda. Delegations
from Angola and Botswana were also represented at the
meeting.
Podgorny, who returned to the Soviet Union yesterday
after an 11-day tour, promised to ship military supplies to
Mozambique for use by the Mozambican army and the
Rhodesian guerrillas.
Diplomatic sources also said Mozambican troops were
being sent to the Soviet Union for training in sophisticated

weaponry.
During his visit Friday to Mozambique, Podgorny in
itialed a 20-year treaty of "friendship and cooperation"
promising to coordinate military operations in the event of
an attack on the former Portuguese colony by Rhodesia.
Final liquidation
The Soviets promised to "continue the consistent strug
gle against the forces of imperialism and for final liquida
tion of colonialism, neocolonialism, racism and apartheid"
in Southern Africa.
Podgorny also met with Kaunda and Nyerere during his
tour, while Castro met with Nyerere, President Samora
Machel of Mozambique and President Agostinho Neto of
Angola.
Castro, whose troops were instrumental in the victory of
the Soviet-supported faction in the Angolan civil war, left
Africa Saturday for a visit to East Berlin.
East German leader Eric Honecker said Castro's trip was
of "exceptional importance for the struggle in the African
region," according to the East German news agency.
Met with Nkomo
While in Zambia, Podgorny met with Nkomo, Sam
Nujoma of the South-West People's Organization (SWAPO)
and Oliver Tambo of the outlawed African National Council
(ANC) of South Africa.
SWAPO is fighting to end South African rule in Namibia,
a former German colony, and the ANC is seeking to oust the
white minority regime in South Africa.

region," according to the East German news agency.
Met with Nkomo
While in Zambia, Podgorny met with Nkomo, Sam
Nujoma of the South-West People's Organization (SWAPO)
and Oliver Tambo of the outlawed African National Council
(ANC) of South Africa.
SWAPO is fighting to end South African rule in Namibia,
a former German colony, and the ANC is seeking to oust the
white minority regime in South Africa.
