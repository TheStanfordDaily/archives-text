# Vance raises possibility of SALT 'miscalculation'
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance has declined to rule
out U.S. miscalculations as a reason for
the Soviet rejection of American
strategic arms limitation proposals.
"No one can say that one never
makes any miscalculations," Vance
told reporters yesterday after giving
President Jimmy Carter his first for
mal, face-to-face assessment of the
arms negotiations in Moscow.
Carter said the United States re
mains determined "to succeed if it's
humanly possible to have permanent
friendship with the Soviet Union and
to have drastic reductions in depen
dence on atomic weapons."
Carter and Vance met with the repor
ters in the White House rose garden
after Vance briefed the president and
his top national security advisers on
the Kremlin's rejection of two Carter
administration proposals. They were:

—To ratify the Vladivostok agree
ment between the two countries limit
ing nuclear arsenals without deciding
whether to include the American
cruise missile or the Soviet backfire
bomber under the pact.
—To cut the number of each coun
try's ballistic missiles and strategic
bombers from 2400 to between 1800
and 2000, and to reduce missiles with
multiple warheads from 1320 to bet
ween 1100 and 1200.
The 2400 and 1320 levels were ag
reed upon in negotiations at Vladivos
tok in 1974.
Carter has expressed the belief that
the United States will reach a strategic
arms limitation treaty with Moscow.
"1 believe the Soviets will ultimately
agree with us that it is to the advantage
of the American people and Soviet
people and the rest of the world to re
duce our dependence" upon nuclear
weapons. Carter said on Vance's return
to the United States Saturday night.
Carter said yesterday he will pursue
such a reduction "without cessation
and with a great deal of determination
and, I believe, also with success."
Assessing reasons for Soviet rejec
tion, Vance said Soviet Leader Leonid
Brezhnev told him the U.S. proposal
for cutbacks was "one-sided and un
fair."
The secretary said the talks were
"businesslike and frank" and added:
"I hope that when they have a chance
to reflect more on the details . . . that

they will come up and raise any ques
tions they may have."
He said the Soviets "indicated very
strongly they wish to keep the talks
going" at Geneva in mid-May.
"I would hope th <t after they have
reflected on it further they will see that
it (the American proposal) is not unfair
. . . and that it takes into account not
only the concerns and problems on
both sides but that it really provides a
stability in the strategic arms area."
Carter said the American proposal
could not have been "a shock to Soviet
leaders" because Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin "was fairly well
conversant with the principles of both
proposals . . . before he went back to
the Soviet Union before the talks be
gan."
Nonetheless, Carter said they were
proposals that "obviously require a
great deal of careful and long-term
negotiation" and added:
"Apparently the Soviets were not
ready to address the second proposal
because it is so substantive and such a
radical change from the past when
strict limits were never proposed."
The president also defended his ad
vance public notice at a news confer
ence about the negotiating agenda,
denying that it hampered the talks.
He also said there was no indication
his crusade for Soviet dissidents'
human rights played a part in the
Soviet rejection.

Washington (AP) — Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance has declined to rule
out U.S. miscalculations as a reason for
the Soviet rejection of American
strategic arms limitation proposals.
"No one can say that one never
makes any miscalculations," Vance
told reporters yesterday after giving
President Jimmy Carter his first for
mal, face-to-face assessment of the
arms negotiations in Moscow.
Carter said the United States re
mains determined "to succeed if it's
humanly possible to have permanent
friendship with the Soviet Union and
to have drastic reductions in depen
dence on atomic weapons."
Carter and Vance met with the repor
ters in the White House rose garden
after Vance briefed the president and
his top national security advisers on
the Kremlin's rejection of two Carter
administration proposals. They were:

—To ratify the Vladivostok agree
ment between the two countries limit
ing nuclear arsenals without deciding
whether to include the American
cruise missile or the Soviet backfire
bomber under the pact.
—To cut the number of each coun
try's ballistic missiles and strategic
bombers from 2400 to between 1800
and 2000, and to reduce missiles with
multiple warheads from 1320 to bet
ween 1100 and 1200.
The 2400 and 1320 levels were ag
reed upon in negotiations at Vladivos
tok in 1974.
Carter has expressed the belief that
the United States will reach a strategic
arms limitation treaty with Moscow.
"1 believe the Soviets will ultimately
agree with us that it is to the advantage
of the American people and Soviet
people and the rest of the world to re
duce our dependence" upon nuclear
weapons. Carter said on Vance's return
to the United States Saturday night.
Carter said yesterday he will pursue
such a reduction "without cessation
and with a great deal of determination
and, I believe, also with success."
Assessing reasons for Soviet rejec
tion, Vance said Soviet Leader Leonid
Brezhnev told him the U.S. proposal
for cutbacks was "one-sided and un
fair."
The secretary said the talks were
"businesslike and frank" and added:
"I hope that when they have a chance
to reflect more on the details . . . that

they will come up and raise any ques
tions they may have."
He said the Soviets "indicated very
strongly they wish to keep the talks
going" at Geneva in mid-May.
"I would hope th <t after they have
reflected on it further they will see that
it (the American proposal) is not unfair
. . . and that it takes into account not
only the concerns and problems on
both sides but that it really provides a
stability in the strategic arms area."
Carter said the American proposal
could not have been "a shock to Soviet
leaders" because Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin "was fairly well
conversant with the principles of both
proposals . . . before he went back to
the Soviet Union before the talks be
gan."
Nonetheless, Carter said they were
proposals that "obviously require a
great deal of careful and long-term
negotiation" and added:
"Apparently the Soviets were not
ready to address the second proposal
because it is so substantive and such a
radical change from the past when
strict limits were never proposed."
The president also defended his ad
vance public notice at a news confer
ence about the negotiating agenda,
denying that it hampered the talks.
He also said there was no indication
his crusade for Soviet dissidents'
human rights played a part in the
