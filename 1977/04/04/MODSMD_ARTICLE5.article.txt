# ERA teeters on the brink of ratification
## 
### Jordan Lorence News analysis 
The Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) has faltered badly in recent
months, raising questions whether it
will ever become part of the Constitu
tion.
The proposed amendment has been
approved by 35 of the 38 states needed
for ratification.
So far this year, eight states have re
fused to approve the ERA, one state
(Indiana) has approved it and another
has rescinded its ratification. Only one
more state, Florida, is expected to act
on the amendment this year.
Three states, Idaho, Nebraska and
Tennessee, have rescinded their ratifi

cations, a move thought invalid by
many constitutional scholars, includ
ing Attorney General Griffin Bell.
These three states will probably be
counted as approving the amendment.
Recisions ignored
In the past. Congress has ignored
state recisions. The Supreme Court
might rule on the legality of recision,
but it has refused to do so in the past.
The 15 states that have not approved
the ERA are Alabama, Arizona, Arkan
sas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.
The Equal Rights Amendment
reads: "Equality of rights under the

law shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any state on the
account of sex."
Congress placed a seven year dead
line for ratification, which expires on
March 22, 1979. This gives the ERA
slightly less than (wo years to be ap
proved.
Passage blocked
ERA supporters say conservative
political organizations and church
groups have blocked passage of the
ERA in the South. Southern states have
traditionally been reluctant to approve
proposed constitutional amendments.
Supporters also say that the Mormon
Church has helped block the amend
ment in Arizona, Nevada and Utah,
states with large Mormon populations.
Another reason for recent defeats is
the changing perceptions of the
amendment's effects. Legislators who
once viewed the ERA as a much
needed reform now view it as a threat
to many areas of American life.
When the ERA was passed by Con
gress in 1972, states clamored to ap
prove it. Hawaii approved the ERA 30
minutes after Congress had. By the end
of 1974, 31 states had ratified the
amendment and final approval
seemed imminent.
Unisex toilets
But then, opponents of the ERA be
came organized. They have success
fully convinced many legislators that

the ERA will result in the drafting of
women, unisex toilets and the legali
zation of homosexual marriages,
among other things.
Opponents say the ERA will not give
women any rights that they don't al
ready have under state and federal
laws. Opponents also state that if the
ERA is passed, theSu preme Court wil 1
make laws in areas traditionally left to
Congress and the state legislatures.
Supporters of the ERA attack these
statements as untrue and unfounded,
meant only to frighten people un
necessarily and to prevent passage of a
much-needed constitutional amend
ment.
Robert Horn, political science pro
fessor here, said the ERA is "put in
such broad language, that what it will
mean will depend on what the Sup
reme Court will interpret it to mean."
Strategy
Strategy for ERA supporters in
cludes campaigning for pro-ERA legis
lators in the 1978 elections and then
pushing for approval by three more
states just before the March 1979 dead
line.
President Jimmy Carter and his wife
Rosalynn have called legislators in
voting states and asked them to vote
for the ERA. In January, Rosalynn Car
ter convinced a wavering Indiana state
senator to vote for the amendment,
where it passed by one vote.

Congress placed a seven year dead
line for ratification, which expires on
March 22, 1979. This gives the ERA
slightly less than (wo years to be ap
proved.
Passage blocked
ERA supporters say conservative
political organizations and church
groups have blocked passage of the
ERA in the South. Southern states have
traditionally been reluctant to approve
proposed constitutional amendments.
Supporters also say that the Mormon
Church has helped block the amend
ment in Arizona, Nevada and Utah,
states with large Mormon populations.
Another reason for recent defeats is
the changing perceptions of the
amendment's effects. Legislators who
once viewed the ERA as a much
needed reform now view it as a threat
to many areas of American life.
When the ERA was passed by Con
gress in 1972, states clamored to ap
prove it. Hawaii approved the ERA 30
minutes after Congress had. By the end
of 1974, 31 states had ratified the
amendment and final approval
seemed imminent.
Unisex toilets
But then, opponents of the ERA be
came organized. They have success
fully convinced many legislators that

the ERA will result in the drafting of
women, unisex toilets and the legali
zation of homosexual marriages,
among other things.
Opponents say the ERA will not give
women any rights that they don't al
ready have under state and federal
laws. Opponents also state that if the
ERA is passed, theSu preme Court wil 1
make laws in areas traditionally left to
Congress and the state legislatures.
Supporters of the ERA attack these
statements as untrue and unfounded,
meant only to frighten people un
necessarily and to prevent passage of a
much-needed constitutional amend
ment.
Robert Horn, political science pro
fessor here, said the ERA is "put in
such broad language, that what it will
mean will depend on what the Sup
reme Court will interpret it to mean."

The Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) has faltered badly in recent
months, raising questions whether it
will ever become part of the Constitu
tion.
The proposed amendment has been
approved by 35 of the 38 states needed
for ratification.
So far this year, eight states have re
fused to approve the ERA, one state
(Indiana) has approved it and another
has rescinded its ratification. Only one
more state, Florida, is expected to act
on the amendment this year.
Three states, Idaho, Nebraska and
Tennessee, have rescinded their ratifi

cations, a move thought invalid by
many constitutional scholars, includ
ing Attorney General Griffin Bell.
These three states will probably be
counted as approving the amendment.
Recisions ignored
In the past. Congress has ignored
state recisions. The Supreme Court
might rule on the legality of recision,
but it has refused to do so in the past.
The 15 states that have not approved
the ERA are Alabama, Arizona, Arkan
sas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.
