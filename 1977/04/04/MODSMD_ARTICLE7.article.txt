# Albers' Wall as artwork, eyesore and heartbreaker
## 
### 
The Wall of artist Josef Albers once
again threatens to divide Stanford in
more ways than one. Art professor Al
bert Elsen has received permission to
place the nine foot high, 54 foot long
white brick wall on the grassy mall in
front of the Physics Tank. (No one
wanted to look at all of those physics
majors anyway.)
The University has been wallowing
in controversy about the Wall for over
a year. Last winter, the Committee on
Land and Building Development re
jected the law school's Canfield Court
as the site for the Wall amid vehement
opposition by many law students.
Site-selection for the Wall has not been
a simple matter. Like the Wall itself,
the controversy has two sides.
No museum
The law students vowed that the
new law school would not become an
art museum where one might inci
dently study torts and Perry Mason.
They might have been mollified if the
artwork in question was the Mona Lisa
or Michelangelo's David. But it was
only a plain, ordinary white brick wall.
No doubt many of you have seen
similar walls supporting roofs or
separating rooms. Proponents of the
Wall found such philistine opinions
vulgar and "something that a law stu
dent would say." Clearly, in the eyes of
the Wall supporters, this is "art." In
deed, an artist built it.
Others railed against the Wall be
cause they felt it would turn the cam
pus into another Berlin. Obviously, if
this happened, the Wilbur-Stern side
of Stanford would be lovingly referred

to as the democratic, fun-loving, prog
ressive, "West Stanford." The Flo
Mo-Frat side of campus would be
sadly referred to as the oppressive,
dreary, stagnant, "East Stanford."

Heartbreak
The maudlin tale of the divided
Stanford would furnish ample fare for
dimestore love thrillers. Picture this:
Toyon woman falls in love with Roble
man, but never shall they entwine in
passionate embrace because of the
cold, obstinate Wall. They exchange
glimpses over the Wall, wave weakly,
throw kisses and pray, "someday,
someday."
President Jimmy Carter might even
come here to give a moving speech to
cheering thousands, proclaiming, "Ich
bin ein Stanfurder." And if the campus
were ever cut off from the outside
world, the ASSU Travel Service could
arrange a charter airlift.
Yale's Wall
The opponents also point out that
Yale, where the late Albers taught, had
a similar Wall. It was the constant
target of vandalism and abuse. Once,
some students erected a poster of a

Jewish Moby Dick on the sculpture
and christened it,"The Whaling
Wall." What will happen, the oppo
nents sneer, if the Wall comes west?
Proponents of the Wall (called
"Walnuts") condemn such arguments
as ridiculous and say they show a lack
of artistic taste and sophistication. Al
bers was not some two-bit playdo re
ject or even a slick, unemployed
bricklayer looking for a quick buck. He
was a famous artist. Therefore, the
proponents say, Stanford should be
honored and "welcome the Wall."
But now the Wall is going up. How
will the teeming masses at Stanford
react to it? Will they say, "Away, ye
devils, and take thine accursed bul
wark with thee," or will they say, "O
Josef Albers, how great thou art!"

art museum where one might inci
dently study torts and Perry Mason.
They might have been mollified if the
artwork in question was the Mona Lisa
or Michelangelo's David. But it was
only a plain, ordinary white brick wall.
No doubt many of you have seen
similar walls supporting roofs or
separating rooms. Proponents of the
Wall found such philistine opinions
vulgar and "something that a law stu
dent would say." Clearly, in the eyes of
the Wall supporters, this is "art." In
deed, an artist built it.
Others railed against the Wall be
cause they felt it would turn the cam
pus into another Berlin. Obviously, if
this happened, the Wilbur-Stern side
of Stanford would be lovingly referred

to as the democratic, fun-loving, prog
ressive, "West Stanford." The Flo
Mo-Frat side of campus would be
sadly referred to as the oppressive,
dreary, stagnant, "East Stanford."

Heartbreak
The maudlin tale of the divided
Stanford would furnish ample fare for
dimestore love thrillers. Picture this:
Toyon woman falls in love with Roble
man, but never shall they entwine in
passionate embrace because of the
cold, obstinate Wall. They exchange
glimpses over the Wall, wave weakly,
throw kisses and pray, "someday,
someday."
President Jimmy Carter might even
come here to give a moving speech to
cheering thousands, proclaiming, "Ich
bin ein Stanfurder." And if the campus
were ever cut off from the outside
world, the ASSU Travel Service could
arrange a charter airlift.
Yale's Wall
The opponents also point out that
Yale, where the late Albers taught, had
a similar Wall. It was the constant
target of vandalism and abuse. Once,
some students erected a poster of a

Jewish Moby Dick on the sculpture
and christened it,"The Whaling
Wall." What will happen, the oppo
nents sneer, if the Wall comes west?
Proponents of the Wall (called
"Walnuts") condemn such arguments
as ridiculous and say they show a lack
of artistic taste and sophistication. Al
bers was not some two-bit playdo re
ject or even a slick, unemployed
bricklayer looking for a quick buck. He
was a famous artist. Therefore, the
proponents say, Stanford should be
honored and "welcome the Wall."
But now the Wall is going up. How
will the teeming masses at Stanford
react to it? Will they say, "Away, ye
devils, and take thine accursed bul
wark with thee," or will they say, "O
Josef Albers, how great thou art!"

The Wall of artist Josef Albers once
again threatens to divide Stanford in
more ways than one. Art professor Al
bert Elsen has received permission to
place the nine foot high, 54 foot long
white brick wall on the grassy mall in
front of the Physics Tank. (No one
wanted to look at all of those physics
majors anyway.)
The University has been wallowing
in controversy about the Wall for over
a year. Last winter, the Committee on
Land and Building Development re
jected the law school's Canfield Court
as the site for the Wall amid vehement
opposition by many law students.
Site-selection for the Wall has not been
a simple matter. Like the Wall itself,
the controversy has two sides.
No museum
The law students vowed that the
new law school would not become an
art museum where one might inci
dently study torts and Perry Mason.
