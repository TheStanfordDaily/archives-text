# Minority admission
## 
### 
Unlike Roots, where the black
American's progress toward equality
was slowly made, progress for
minorities in medical education is
being eroded with an ever increasing
velocity.
On Feb. 22 the United States Sup
reme Court accepted tor consideration
the Bakke case which, if decided for
the plaintiff, would have the effect of
reversing recent gains by cutting off
the supply of black and other minority
physicians.
The Supreme Court's verdict will
gain immediate attention and perhaps
action by the admissions committees
and legal counsels for American
schools of medicine, law and other
graduate and professional programs.
In 1967, the year before the assassi
nation of Martin Luther King Jr.,
virtually all the black students enrol
led in medical schools in the United
States were at Howard University in
Washington, D.C. and Meharry Medi
cal College in Nashville, Tennessee.
With King's assassination came a
change in the exclusionary policies
that in effect maintained a "quota" on
the number of minorities admitted to
medical school.
Requirements expand
Admissions criteria were broadened
to include factors that indicated a de
sire to deliver medical services to
people who lacked access to physi
cians, factors that would indicate a
student's capacity for compassion, and
his or her ability to effectively interact
with patients of all races and
nationalities. These factors were
added to, not exchanged for high
levels of achievement on standardized
tests and grades in pre-medical
academic courses. The fact is that
many white students that would not
have been admitted under rigid,
strictly numerical academic criteria
were now gaining admission to medi
cal school to study the science and to
learn the art of medicine.
Many schools such as Stanford and
Harvard, after much prodding, took an
active interest in the recruitment and
retention of minority medical stu
dents. Both of these institutions now
have a minimum goal of parity bet
ween the percentage of minority med
ical students and the percentage of
minority people in the population.
Minority admissions
One of the mechanisms used to try to
reach this goal has been the minority
admissions subcommittee to medical
school admissions committees. On
this committee sit faculty members
and medical students who are both
cognizant of and sensitive to the dif
ferences that exist between races and
economic classes. This subcommittee
evaluates the application of minority
students according to the one set of
criteria used foradmissionand in light
of the differences that exist between
minority and majority students.
Similar approaches to admission
have been used across the country, re
sulting in an increase in the number of

minority medical students in the Un
ited States to 4324 in 1974 and 1723 in
1970, fully 10 per cent of the total
number of medical students.
Recruitment up
The federal government's Office of
Economic Opportunity (disbanded by
Nixon during his first term) estab
lished Project 75, a program whose
goal was to assist in the recruitment
and retention of minority students into
American medical schools. The target
goal for minority medical students was
12 per cent of the nation's medical stu
dents by 1975. This percentage was
never met, but the numbers did in
crease. It was no coincidence to the
concerned observer that when Project
75 was dismantled in 1975, the
number of minority medical students
immediately began to drop.
In 1975, for the first time since
King's assassination, the number of
first year minority group students fell
to 1391 (9.1 per cent). In the 1976
academic year it remained approxi
mately the same. This decrease coin
cided with the Marco Defunis case, the
first nationally publicized "reverse
discrimination" suit brought against a
university.
Bakke predecessor
In this suit a white law student sued
the University of Washington for ad
mission to law school on grounds
similar to those in the present case be
fore the Supreme Court. The Supreme
Court declared the Defunis case moot,
because he had already been admitted,
thus no court action was necessary.
This has, in effect, delayed the deci
sion to be made to the present case.
To me it seems odd that after the
urban riots and assassinations of the
late '60s, when doors to professional
education at predominantly white
universities began to crack open, that
the same argument used to open them
is now being actively used to close
them. Article XIV, Section I of theCon
stitution of the United States, states
that no state shall "deny to any person
within its jurisdiction equal protection
of the laws."
Amendment misused
Intended to bring black slaves into
the mainstream of society when it was
ratified in 1868, the Fourteenth
Amendment is now being misused as
justification for retrenchment of the
programs long fought for in Congress,
in the courts, in the back of buses and
in Alabama church basements.
The false argument of "reverse dis
crimination" is now the tactic of

choice in dismembering educational
altirmative action. The essence of this
argument is that affirmative action
programs which seek to recruit and
admit minority students are "unfair"
in that they exclude white students.
Their claim is that this is the same
method that was formerly used to
exclude minorities.
When predominantly white schools
began to admit minority students, they
did not do so by taking away admis
sions opportunities from white stu
dents, they did so by increasing the
class size. The absolute number of
white students attending medical
school has increased every year since
the affirmative action push began.
Charge unfounded
How can "reverse discrimination"
exist when he who is claiming to be
adversely affected by the process is
gaining entrance into medical school
in an ever increasing absolute number
and percentage?
It has not been nor will it ever be
unusual for a school to set goals for the
class of students it admits. Schools
such as Loma Linda attract and admit
many students of one particular relig
ion. The University of Illinois has re
cently experimented with giving pre
ference in admissions to medical
school to students from rural
backgrounds who have demonstrated
an interest in going back to rural areas
to practice medicine.
State quotas
Several state legislatures have man
dated that their state schools of
medicine restrict admissions to a great
extent to residents of that state in
hopes of maximizing the number of
future practitioners within that state.
The federal government has even
gone into the business of specifying
what students medical schools must
accept. Public Law 94-484 (Health Pro
fessionals p]ducational Assistance Act
of 1976), signed into law on Oct. 12,
1976, states that in order to qualify for
capitation grants, schools must accept
an "equitable percentage" of Ameri
can students studying in foreign med
ical schools who pass Part I of the Na
tional Medical Board's examination.
Although many schools are resisting
this "intrusion" on the admissions
process, others plan to comply.
