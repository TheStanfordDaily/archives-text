# Frats plan to pledge about 233

With fraternity rush starting last
night, Inter-Fraternity Council Rush
Chairman Dave Dick predicted that
frats will have little trouble meeting
their quota of new members.
The University will ask fraternities
to pledge "right around 233
sophomore-equivalents," according to
Tom Hornbeak, assistant row office di
rector.
A sophomore-equivalent is a person
with two guaranteed years of on
campus housing left. A person with
one year of guaranteed housing counts
as half a sophomore-equivalent.
"1 don't see any reason why frater
nities shouldn't meet the quota," Dick
said. "There's a lot of freshman in
terest."
"There's a resurgence of fraternities
at other schools, too," Hornbeak said.
Delta Tau Delta â€¢
Delta Tau Delta received permission
from current residents of 650 San Juan
to hold three open houses at that
house, Hornbeak said. The Delts lived
at 650 San Juan last year, and will re
turn next year, but were denied group
living privileges last year, following
vandalism by members last spring.
In addition to open houses, frater
nity rush functions will include beach
trips, casino parties and a "plethora of
barbeques," Dick said.
House rush budgets range from "a
few hundred to one to two thousand
dollars," he added.
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
will try to leave as much of rush as
possible to individual houses, Dick
said. However, he also said the IFC
will convene two meetings of rush
chairmen so houses can find out what
rushees might be bid elsewhere.
"We hope to keep houses from mak
ing as many overlapping bids" as pre
viously, he explained.
None 'on notice'
No fraternities are "on notice" from
last year, Hornbeak said. To be "on
notice," a house must either miss its
quota in a year the fraternity system
misses its total quota, or a house must
miss its quota by more than 10 per cent
in a year the fraternity system meets its
quota.
If a fraternity is "on notice" for three
of tour years, Horbeak said, the frater
nity house might be placed in the draw
the next year.
bast year, the fraternity system faced
a quota of 217 sophomore-equivalents,
and exceeded the quota by 19.5. This
year's quota is higher, Hornbeak said,
because the Delts were not included in
last year's figures.
