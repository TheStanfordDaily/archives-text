According to Jam6s Fin ley, chair
man of the board of the J.P. Stevens
company, the 1 800 students who
signed a petition asking the University
to vote in favor of two proxy resolu
tions which asked for disclosure of the
company's affirmative action figures
and labor practices, "did not take the
time or make the effort to come to an
informed judgment concerning the
campaign which the Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union is
waging against Stevens."
Finlev should know that the reason
wtiv 1600 Stanford students. 70 fa
culty. and the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (C-IR) all urged
the University to vote in favor of the
two resolutions is because Stevens is
the number one labor law violator in
the country.
NLRA violations
Since 1965 the National Labor Rela
tions Hoard (NLRB) has found Stevens
guilty of violating the National Labor
Relations Act (NI.RA). the basic law
which protects the rights of unions
and prevents unfair labor practice, 15
times. Eight of the convictions were
upheld by federal appeals courts and
three by llie U.S. Supreme Court.
Among other things. Stevens has
consistently fired workers for their
union activities only to lose in court
battles and be forced to reinstate the
workers with backpay but long after
the union has lost the election due to
Stevens' illegal firings.
The Union has lost 11 of 12 elections
because of Stevens' ability to
capitalize on legal loopholes such as
this, not because workers didn't want a
union.
It is also no surprise that union
membership is declining at Stevens
because the company has threatened
union sympathizers with reprisals, re
fused to hire workers sympathetic to

the union, refused to hire workers
whose relatives were union members,
arbitrarily reduced the wages of work
ers who voted for a union and
threatened to shut down plants if
workers voted to join the union.
Stonewalled
Even after workers successfully
voted to join the union, Stevens' blat
ant and illegal anti-union practices
continued; recently, the NLRB took
Stevens to court for failure to bargain
in good faith at the Roanoke Rapids,
N.C. plant.
During two fruitless years of com
pulsory arbitration the company
stonewalled at the bargaining table,
not even willing to allow a dues chec
koff or arbitration of greivance.
At the Statesboro, Ga., plant Stevens
was found guilty of five counts ofbad
faith bargaining. Stevens' response
was to shut down the plant.
Stevens has also been found guilty
of racial discriminatory employment
practices. Stevens' claim of a 23 per
cent minority work force hides the
truth that the company consistently
reserves the lowest paying jobs for
minorities. Only seven per cent of the
skilled craft jobs are held by minorities
although they occupy 38 per cent of
the unskilled jobs. Only three per cent
of white-collar jobs are held by
minorities. In December 1975, U.S.
District Judge F.T. Dupree Jr. found
Stevens guilty of eight charges includ
ing hiring on the basis of race, reserv
ing clerical jobs for white employees
only, discrimination in job assign
ments, discrimination in the assign
ment of newly hired blacks to the
lower-paying jobs and paying black
workers nearly $670 less per year than
white workers even though this could
not be explained by education or
length ot employment differences.
Although Stevens claims its wages

have risen an average of seven per cent
per year for the last 10 years, the com
pany still pays more than 30 per cent
less than companies paid elsewhere in
the nation.
Stevens claims that the union has
been found guilty of unfair labor prac
tices more often than the company. But
what Stevens fails to mention is that all
of Stevens' violations have been since
1965 — only 12 years ago — whereas
the union has accumulated various
violations since 1935 — over 40 years
ago — beginning in a period when
labor strife was more violent and
fierce.
The NLRB regional director said in
July, 1976: "Since on or about June
1963, and at all times thereafter, J.P.
Stevens has engaged in a massive,
multi-state campaign to deny its
employees their own choosing . . . has
committed unfair labor practices of
unprecedented flagrancy and mag
nitude. . ."
Not uninformed
Why did 1600 "uninformed" Stan
ford students sign the petition? Be
cause they knew that J.P. Stevens has
had the worst record of breaking the
law of any U.S. corporation in history.
Stevens has broken the law because
it has been more profitable to do soand
pay fines rather than sign a fair and just
union agreement, and Stevens will
continue to do so unless it gets the
message that people won't buy from a
firm which disregards the basic rights
of workers.
Stanford can help the union fight
injustice at J.P. Stevens by boycotting
all Stevens products and by carrying
the message to other people in the
community.
