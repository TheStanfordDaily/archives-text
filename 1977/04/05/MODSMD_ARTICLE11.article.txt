# Ungeneration too self-serving

Since the youth of the 1920s are
known as the kairos "lost generation,"
and that of the 1950s as the "silent
generation," I'm wondering how the
youth of my time will be described a
few years from now. Will we be known
to history as the "self-serving seven
ties?" As the "anaesthetized genera
tion?"! suppose calling this era the
"second silent generation" wouldn't
be too far off t he mark, since we have in
a sense returned to the '50s- Like the
youth of that time, mv contempoi dries
champion no social orpo!i ,: cal causes.
This generation is marked by a
thorough indifference to everything
that does not relate to our immediate
selves and futures. Having turned from
the subjectivity and romantic excess of
the '60s. we've entered a materialistic,
unsentimental age.
The spirit of the '70s manifests itself
in nearly every aspect of student life.
Each incoming class, for instance,
dresses more conservatively. Adidas
and cutoffs have given way to less
scruffy attire; women are wearing
more makeup. The pages of the Daily
are spotted with articles discussing the
return of Stanford sororities; that sup
posed family of dissidents, the Al
liance for Radical Change, is a de
crepit! remnant of its former self.
The jargon of this age also betrays
our sluggish spirit. our retreat from ac

tivisni. The word "mellow," one of the
catchwords of this decade, is now used
in a complementary sense, as a sort of
be-all-and-end-all of personality traits.
Hut "mellow" really means laying
back, laying low, acceptance. It means
not being outraged.
All of which makes me kind of un
easy. particularly since we've got so
many things to be outraged about. It's
just that in this complacency of ours,
in our drugged acquiescence, we've
stopped asking questions about the
university's civic responsibility (or ir
responsibility), its duty to students
and society at large.
We've stopped asking questions
about the significance of our own fu
ture roles within a local or national
community, Caught in a system that
rides roughshod over all people, par
ticularly women and minorities, we
nonetheless ignore the real nightmare
of the "American dream."
I'd like to think that the failure of the
New Left in the 1960s is partially re
sponsible for these prevailing at
titudes. I'd like to think that because of
that failure individuals have turned
from movements to a more personal
style of radicalism, to making small
revolutions from within.
Although that may be true some
where. the state of student politics in
dicates that this is not the same

among undergraduates.
The Daily has already printed a
number of editorials related to the
Stanford political sandbox, and I'm
not about to add to that din. It should
be noted though that the election and
re-election of that ilk to the student
political bodies reflects the rampant
apoliticaJism among students. Votes
go to candidates with the most market
able personalities — those who shook
the most hands, flash the most smiles,
and charm the greatest number of
freshmen. The platform doesn't enter
the picture.
It would be comforting to believe
that behind all this grade-grubbing
there's a bit of utopianism, a bit of a
vision that students' future power will
be used for progressive purposes. But I
haven't gotten the idea that this is a
popular sentiment. It seems like stu
dents are flocking to biz school and
law school because its become the
thing to do. We all work to show our
"concern for the future' and our "good
sense" — all of which means that we're
only looking out for ourselves.
Even for all of our apparent direc
tion, even for our societal niches, the
youth of my time is bound by no ties.
Believing in nothing, standing for no
thing, this isn't a "generation" at all.
It's an "un-generation."
