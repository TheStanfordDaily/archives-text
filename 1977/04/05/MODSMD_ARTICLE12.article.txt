(Second of two parts.)
It has long been a prerogative of pro
fessional schools to admit applicants
who happen to be the offspring of
alumni or faculty members. It has not
been necessary to advertise this area of
admission, in that those who need to
know already do.
This practice is extremely long
standing. Even the Hippocratic Oath
which physicians have taken for cen
turies says that, "1 will impart a know
ledge of the Art to my own sons and to
those of my teachers, and to disciples
bound by a stipulation and oath ac
cording to the law of medicine, but to
none others."
For the few of us who have gained
access to medical education it has
meant the difference between ascend
ing to the fullest potential of our ta
lents and having that potential wasted
in positions far beneath the capacity of
our present and future contributions.
For me, the most important aspect of
medical school has been learning to

accept the unwritten responsibility of
success within the black community.
Not only must 1 seek the excellence
in the practice of medicine, I must also
prop open the closing door to others
who wish to seek that same excellence.
While this same concern is felt by in
dividuals within the majority, it is not
perceived as a responsibility.
For me, it has been the driving force
that has allowed me to remain rational,
compassionate and altruistic in an ir
rational. egotistical and often malevo
lent system. I have accepted this re
sponsibility and I am continually
laboring to fulfill it. I have no dreams
of rapid accomplishment. A rational
person realizes that the battlefront is
no longer in the Congress and in the
state legislatures, it is in that section of
the mind that defines and effects mor
ality. The Civil Rights Act has been
passed and we have been told that "A
mind is a terrible thing to waste." Is it
not absurd that this country imports 20
per cent of its physician population
from foreign countries to care for these

wasting minds?
One of Jimmy Carter's campaign
statements alter the snafu he created
when he defended the purity of Polish
neighborhoods was "There is too
much ethnic purity in medicine." He
made the statement before several
thousand minority medical students at
the National Conference of the Student
National Medical Association. He has
yet to make one move to correct the
problem that was then so advantage
ous to enunciate.
So this fall, the Supreme Court will
decide whether the University of
California at Davis violated the Con
stitution of the United States by
facilitating the admission of well qual
ified minority students into medical
school. Even if our left foot is cut off in
addition to the right, this struggle will
continue. It must.

(Second of two parts.)
It has long been a prerogative of pro
fessional schools to admit applicants
who happen to be the offspring of
alumni or faculty members. It has not
been necessary to advertise this area of
admission, in that those who need to
know already do.
This practice is extremely long
standing. Even the Hippocratic Oath
which physicians have taken for cen
turies says that, "1 will impart a know
ledge of the Art to my own sons and to
those of my teachers, and to disciples
bound by a stipulation and oath ac
cording to the law of medicine, but to
none others."
