Narconon contract
Kurt Cobb's article, "City Balks on
Drug Services," (Daily, March 31),
contains a major error of fact.
Cobb writes that Narconon's con
tract with Palo Alto was terminated,
"after the city decided the program
had been ineffective."
Actually the contract was officially
terminated because Narconon al
legedly did not comply with a city
council directive to expand the board
of directors to facilitate wider com
munity involvement in the program.
Narconon's effectiveness was not an
issue, and indeed several city council
members praised the programs' per
formance as they cancelled its con
tract.
A city evaluation of Narconon was
not published nor seen by the city
council until several weeks after the
cancellation.
Finally, there is considerable evi
dence that the city council's decision
was based on neither their reason or
Cobb's reason, but rather on political
expediency.
Peter Drusts. president of the na
tional Narconon office, claims that he
visited Mayor Stanley Norton in Nor
ton's office, and that in the course of
their discussion Norton had stated
"That the subject of the Narconon Palo
Alto contract has become an "election
issue and that the executive director of
Narconon, Nate Jessup, was "politi
cally naive." Jessup had been told to
"keep his skirts clean."
Drusts stated Norton stressed the
fact that Narconon had become an
election issue "by pointing out of his
window at a building and saying that
he had voted against that also, because
the taxpayers were "not likely to
forget." Norton denies going this far in
his remarks, but acknowledges the
drug program has "been political from
the start."

ASSU concerts
My hat's off to former ASSU special
events director Randy Phillips. Not
only was he able to book the top qual
ity groups he did while here at Stan
ford. but upon his leaving to promote
the concerts at University of Santa
Clara, he seems to have taken all of the
top talent with him, leaving Stanford
with a bunch of second raters.
Not to knock Emmylou Harris, Her
bie Hancock, et al, but they're not

exactly the likes of Stephen Stills, Neil
Young, Earth, Wind and Fire, or the
Band, that we've seen before at previ
ous concerts here at Stanford.
It is frankly beyond my comprehen
sion as to why there is <;nmp mystical
attraction to Mr. Phillips and the Uni
versity of Santa Clara as opposed to
Stanford that leads all the attractions
to appear at the former rather than the
latter.
It does seem a bit strange that at re
cent Stanford concerts, Phillips seems
to have been the one running the
whole show. I can see only one legiti
mate reason for this myself; ASSU spe
cial events director knowles doesn't
know how to run his own concerts and
at the same time Mr. Phillips is willing
to donate his time to an alma mater
which enabled him to take in over
$20,000 last summer alone. 1 can only
guess at any other reasons for such an
arrangement.

Law admissions
1 am writing in response to tin; letter
(Daily. Mar. 24) from the Chicano law
students at Stanford to the law school

alumni regarding the precipitous drop
in minority students admitted to the
law school. Clearly there is some effort
to decrease the number of minority
students. How can it be remedied?
The chicano law students suggest
that alumni and others can help press
for more admissions. Hut they miss the
most important point: minority admis
sions will only be preserved if minor
ity faculty are hired.
Certain minorities which are well
represented on the faculty are also well
represented in the student body.
Of course, the common refrain of fa
culty is that they "can't find" qualified
minority faculty and students. In fair
ness they ought to be invited to publi
cally prove their theory by providing
the credentials of all faculty applicants
(with names blacked out) to the trus
tees, the legislature, the department of
Health Education and Welfare (HEW)
and to the public.
It is only through the establishment
of a monitoring system to publically
determine how many applicants there
are and what their credentials are that
we will know the full story.

Peter Drusts. president of the na

visited Mayor Stanley Norton in Nor

their discussion Norton had stated
"That the subject of the Narconon Palo
Alto contract has become an "election
issue and that the executive director of
Narconon, Nate Jessup, was "politi
cally naive." Jessup had been told to
"keep his skirts clean."
Drusts stated Norton stressed the
fact that Narconon had become an
election issue "by pointing out of his
window at a building and saying that
he had voted against that also, because
the taxpayers were "not likely to

ASSU concerts
My hat's off to former ASSU special
events director Randy Phillips. Not
only was he able to book the top qual
ity groups he did while here at Stan
ford. but upon his leaving to promote
the concerts at University of Santa
Clara, he seems to have taken all of the
top talent with him, leaving Stanford
with a bunch of second raters.
Not to knock Emmylou Harris, Her
bie Hancock, et al, but they're not

exactly the likes of Stephen Stills, Neil
Young, Earth, Wind and Fire, or the
Band, that we've seen before at previ
ous concerts here at Stanford.
It is frankly beyond my comprehen
sion as to why there is <;nmp mystical
attraction to Mr. Phillips and the Uni
versity of Santa Clara as opposed to
Stanford that leads all the attractions
to appear at the former rather than the
latter.
It does seem a bit strange that at re
cent Stanford concerts, Phillips seems
to have been the one running the
whole show. I can see only one legiti
mate reason for this myself; ASSU spe
cial events director knowles doesn't
know how to run his own concerts and
at the same time Mr. Phillips is willing
to donate his time to an alma mater
which enabled him to take in over
$20,000 last summer alone. 1 can only
guess at any other reasons for such an
arrangement.

Law admissions
1 am writing in response to tin; letter
(Daily. Mar. 24) from the Chicano law
students at Stanford to the law school

alumni regarding the precipitous drop
in minority students admitted to the
law school. Clearly there is some effort
to decrease the number of minority
students. How can it be remedied?
The chicano law students suggest
that alumni and others can help press
for more admissions. Hut they miss the
most important point: minority admis
sions will only be preserved if minor
ity faculty are hired.
Certain minorities which are well
represented on the faculty are also well
represented in the student body.
Of course, the common refrain of fa
culty is that they "can't find" qualified
minority faculty and students. In fair
ness they ought to be invited to publi
cally prove their theory by providing
the credentials of all faculty applicants
(with names blacked out) to the trus
tees, the legislature, the department of
Health Education and Welfare (HEW)
and to the public.
It is only through the establishment
of a monitoring system to publically
determine how many applicants there
are and what their credentials are that
we will know the full story.

Narconon contract
Kurt Cobb's article, "City Balks on
Drug Services," (Daily, March 31),
contains a major error of fact.
Cobb writes that Narconon's con
tract with Palo Alto was terminated,
"after the city decided the program
had been ineffective."
Actually the contract was officially
terminated because Narconon al
legedly did not comply with a city
council directive to expand the board
of directors to facilitate wider com
munity involvement in the program.
Narconon's effectiveness was not an
issue, and indeed several city council
members praised the programs' per
formance as they cancelled its con
tract.
A city evaluation of Narconon was
not published nor seen by the city
council until several weeks after the
cancellation.
Finally, there is considerable evi
dence that the city council's decision
was based on neither their reason or
Cobb's reason, but rather on political
expediency.
