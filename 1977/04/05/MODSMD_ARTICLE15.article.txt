# Former Yale student spent $13,000 to falsify application

(CPS) â€” Two ex-students have
proved true that age-old reassur
ance offered by admissions of
ficers that grades and test scores
are not the only credentials that
count in gaining admission to
college. You can also cheat your
way in, as flustered admissions
personnel at Yale and West Vir
ginia University have learned.
Yale faculty and adminis
trators shivered with expectant
delight as Patrick Michael
McDermit, alias Andrea Alrea,
entered the Ivy League school's
freshman class last September.
After all, his high school grades
were excellent, his recommen
dations gushed endless ap
proval, his command of several
foreign languages encompassed
Portuguese and a dialect of a
long-extinct tongue in India, and
in the three vears since he had

finished school, he had garnered
a $30 million nest egg through
successful business deals and
investments.
So his application said. Not
until Dec. 1, when he withdrew
from school, did Yale officials
learn that McDermit had doc
tored his transcripts and in effect
take on a second identity.
"I just got tired of playing the
game," McDermit explained.
Formerly a construction
worker in Los Angeles, the self
proclaimed genius estimated he
spent $13,000 on his game. Costs
included in the bill were dummy
telephone extensions, a post of
fice box, rental of a hotel suite,
fine clothes and travel ex
penses.
"Admissions is trying to
tighten checking, but we don't
run a police service," noted a

university spokesman. "The
only way we could have stopped
him would have been by using
the school s alumni committee
in Los Angeles. We could have
told one of our alumni who is a
banker in Beverly Hills, 'hey,
this guy looks too good,' and he
could have interviewed him."
Yale students, continued the
spokesman, are disheartened
that McDermit left because they
think he was bright enough to
stay. However, the university
administration takes a dim view
of McDermit's hoax, he added.
Meanwhile, the ex-Eli has de
parted for Paris to write a book.
"Something like this hap
pened at the Harvard Business
School, too," the Yale spokes
man recollected.
