# All's quiet on Berkeley front
## Passions cool in election 
### 
Berkeley (AP) —The city that
was the caldron of political pro
test in the 1960s is quiet in 1977
as a coalition advocating social
change makes its fourth try to
take over city government.
Candidate forums draw few
voters. Political posters and leaf
lets are scarce.
It's an odd atmosphere for the
town that saw the birth of the
Free Speech Movement,
People's Park riots and countless
antiwar demonstrations in the
1960s and early 19705.
Today's University of Califor
nia freshmen were four or five
years old when the Free Speech
Movement demonstrations
started, and nineto 10 at thetime
of People's Park, when police
helicopters circled the campus
and tear gas fumes drifted down
Telegraph Avenue.
Even the Vietnam War is only
history to some of the campus
population. Earlier this year
year, a CIA recruiter on the UC
campus attracted only a handful
of demonstrators.
Times have changed
Berkeley's utility polls — trad
itionally the city's busiest politi
cal bulletin boards — are co
vered with notices about such
things as psychic readings,

meditation groups, rock and
classical concerts, nude rap ses
sions and car pools.
Tom Hayden, the former
Chicago Seven defendant and
defeated candidate for U.S. Se
nate, who is backing the Ber
keley Citizens Action slate, said
of the race:
"There's some apathy toward
the election. The quality of Ber
keley that's unique is that they
excel and the community gets
turned on when they are doing
something that's ground
breaking.
"But there's a loss of steam
when they're doing something
that's been done before. It
doesn't mean the vote will
necessarily be bad. It just means
the amount of energy of
the volunteers is not all that
high."
Little attention
Both established and
"counter-culture" newspapers
in the area have devoted rela
tively little attention to the race.
At stake in the April 19 munic
ipal election is control of a
$SU-million city budget.
A coalition variously de
scribed as "progressive" or "rad
ical" has held three of the nine
city council seats for the past six
years. The coalition — Berkeley
Citizens Action, or BCA — is try
ing again for a council majority
this year.
Members of the council major
ity describe themselves as liberal
Democrats. They are supported
by conservatives and
businessmen. Republicans, with
only 13 per cent registration,
quit fielding their own candi
dates four years ago and now
back the Democrat slate.
BCA leaders say there won't be
any dramatic change if they gain
control, and their language is re
strained — not radical.
Rent control
But the BCA platform contains
proposals such as rent control
and formation of tenant unions,

imposition of a city income tax
and designation of child care as
"a right" of all city residents.
"If you're looking for dramatic
differences if we had a majority, 1
don't think you'd find them un
less you lived here," said Ying
Lee kelley. a BCA candidate
running for a second four-year
term.
"Community participation is
very, very much a part of our
platform. We're not talking
about substantive changes in the
process. We're talking about
providing better government by
involving the people, and that
may not be dramatic," added
kelley. a 44-year-old native of
Shanghai who came to Califor
nia in 1945.
Vice Mayor Sue Hone, who is
seeking re-election with backing
of the Berkeley Democratic Club
coalition, has a different view.
Wealth redistribution
"They are committed to redis
tributing the wealth of Ber
keley," the 38-year-old Hone
said of Kelley and the BCA slate.
"They would achieve their
goals by a highly progressive in
come tax on local residents, a
rent control ordinance designed
to reduce the value of rental
property. Then it could be
purchased at very low cost by the
city and become a community
resource.
"They are still committed to
the acquisition of the Pacific Cas
& Klectric distribution system,
the telephone company, the
cable television system — not
because it would be an economi
cally good move for the tax
payers, but because it would be
community control of economic
assets. These are things 1 oppose.
These are things they support,"
she said.
Kelley agrees that items cited
by Hone are part of the BCA plat
form. But she says the emphasis
is wrong, that community par
ticipation is the important issue
separating them.
