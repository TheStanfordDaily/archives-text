## Rock/jim tranquada 'We make people's ears bleed' 
### Jim Tranquada 
"Punk rock" is a label like any
other: a nebulous generalization
that is frequently applied be
cause of ignorance or conveni
ence. The term punk rock usu
ally conjures up a picture of
faded levis, leather jackets and
loud three-chord incompetence.
But bands like the Ramones,
the Dictators, the Talking Heads
and Television, however they
are categorized, are now flaunt
ing new recording contracts and
a growing national following.
From their beginnings in Man
hattan clubs like CBGB and
Max's Kansas City, these New
York bands have formed the nuc
leus of the so-called "punkrock"
music phenomenon that has in
spired imitators all over the
country.
The Dictators, whose new al
bum, Manifest Destiny on
Asylum, is due sometime in

May, made their first West Coast
appearance on Thursday at
Mabuhay Gardens, the center of
the fledgling but flourishing San
Francisco punk scene.
Two years ago, a friend of
mine won the Dictators' first al
bum, The Dictators Go Girl
Crazy, by correctly identifying a
song on KZSU. After playing the
first side, he left it out in the sun
to warp.
Everyone, including the band,
assured me before the concert
that they can actually play now.
The Dictators claim that their
first album, featuring admittedly
minimal instrumental talent and
songs like "Master Race Rock,"
was misunderstood. "Everyone
either took us too seriously or
took the whole thing as a joke,"
lamented rhythm guitarist Top
Ten.
The album, which sold all of
7000 copies, got no airplay and

no promotion. Epic dropped the
act because the Dictators fired
their drummer the day before the
album was released and couldn't
tour as a result.
But the Dictators still assert
that humor and a general lack of
pretentiousness set them apart
from the other New York bands.
They respect the Ramones and
like their music, but recognize it
as limited and only acknow
ledge the possibility of real suc
cess for themselves.
The band's sense of irony is
tempered by a hard realism,
however. "People don't want
their rock 'n roll funny," ob
served Andy Shernoff,
keyboards player and songwri
ter. "Our humor is getting more
and more subtle until it's gonna
be noticeable to about 15 per
cent of the audience."
This "subtlety of humor" re
flects the band's increased seri

ousness about their music. The
band has acquired a new rhythm
section, Mark Mendoza on bass
and Rich Teter on drums, and
has honed the act through exten
sive touring in the last year, most
recently opening eight dates for
Kiss. "The band's a lot better
now —we can play, said Dick
Manotoba, lead vocalist and
self-proclaimed handsomest
man in rock n roll We make
people's ears bleed.
The contrast between the Dic
tators and the opening act, the
Nuns, provided a striking exam
ple of the distance that separates
the Dictators from their contem
poraries. The Nuns, a local punk
rock band, play loud, angry
music. They are scornfully
awareoftheir musical ineptness,
are proud of it.and flaunt it.
They are, however, merely a pale
imitation of the better-known
New York bands; their anger is
forced, not genuine, and their
decadent stance self-indulgent
and self-conscious.
When the Dictators finally
came on, the Gardens sprang to
life. You could feel the electric
ity in the air as it charged
through the cigarette smoke and
people leapt to their feet. The de
tached air with which the audi
ence had responded to the Nuns
disappeared.
And it turned out that all those
people were right, after all. The
Dictators have learned how to
play —and what they play is
loud, high-energy, straight
forward rock 'n roll, structured
around power chords; sustained
by two rhythm guitars and ac
centuated Peter Townsend —like
gymnastics. It is a far cry from
the chunkachunka primitivism
of the Nuns; the Dictators play
heavy metal without the bom
bast.
The Dictators were a tight
band, and despite the nature of
the music, there were few exces
ses or indulgences by lead
guitarist Ross Funichello to mar
the music or the pacing of the
show. If the amplification hadn't
been such that the vocals were
unintelligible and the drum
ming muffled, the well-satisfied
crowd would ha'Ve had nothing
to complain about except the ex
cessive crowding that left many
people standing.

imitation of the better-known
New York bands; their anger is
forced, not genuine, and their
decadent stance self-indulgent
and self-conscious.
When the Dictators finally
came on, the Gardens sprang to
life. You could feel the electric
ity in the air as it charged
through the cigarette smoke and
people leapt to their feet. The de
tached air with which the audi
ence had responded to the Nuns
disappeared.
And it turned out that all those
people were right, after all. The
Dictators have learned how to
play —and what they play is
loud, high-energy, straight
forward rock 'n roll, structured
around power chords; sustained
by two rhythm guitars and ac
centuated Peter Townsend —like
gymnastics. It is a far cry from
the chunkachunka primitivism
of the Nuns; the Dictators play
heavy metal without the bom
bast.
The Dictators were a tight
band, and despite the nature of
the music, there were few exces
ses or indulgences by lead
guitarist Ross Funichello to mar
the music or the pacing of the
show. If the amplification hadn't
been such that the vocals were
unintelligible and the drum
ming muffled, the well-satisfied
crowd would ha'Ve had nothing
to complain about except the ex
cessive crowding that left many
people standing.
"Punk rock" is a label like any
other: a nebulous generalization
that is frequently applied be
cause of ignorance or conveni
ence. The term punk rock usu
ally conjures up a picture of
faded levis, leather jackets and
loud three-chord incompetence.
But bands like the Ramones,
the Dictators, the Talking Heads
and Television, however they
are categorized, are now flaunt
ing new recording contracts and
a growing national following.
From their beginnings in Man
hattan clubs like CBGB and
Max's Kansas City, these New
York bands have formed the nuc
leus of the so-called "punkrock"
music phenomenon that has in
spired imitators all over the
country.
The Dictators, whose new al
bum, Manifest Destiny on
Asylum, is due sometime in

May, made their first West Coast
appearance on Thursday at
Mabuhay Gardens, the center of
the fledgling but flourishing San
Francisco punk scene.
Two years ago, a friend of
mine won the Dictators' first al
bum, The Dictators Go Girl
Crazy, by correctly identifying a
song on KZSU. After playing the
first side, he left it out in the sun
to warp.
Everyone, including the band,
assured me before the concert
that they can actually play now.
The Dictators claim that their
first album, featuring admittedly
minimal instrumental talent and
songs like "Master Race Rock,"
was misunderstood. "Everyone
either took us too seriously or
took the whole thing as a joke,"
lamented rhythm guitarist Top
Ten.
The album, which sold all of
7000 copies, got no airplay and

no promotion. Epic dropped the
act because the Dictators fired
their drummer the day before the
album was released and couldn't
tour as a result.
But the Dictators still assert
that humor and a general lack of
pretentiousness set them apart
from the other New York bands.
They respect the Ramones and
like their music, but recognize it
as limited and only acknow
ledge the possibility of real suc
cess for themselves.
The band's sense of irony is
tempered by a hard realism,
however. "People don't want
their rock 'n roll funny," ob
served Andy Shernoff,
keyboards player and songwri
ter. "Our humor is getting more
and more subtle until it's gonna
be noticeable to about 15 per
cent of the audience."
This "subtlety of humor" re
flects the band's increased seri

ousness about their music. The
band has acquired a new rhythm
section, Mark Mendoza on bass
and Rich Teter on drums, and
has honed the act through exten
sive touring in the last year, most
recently opening eight dates for
Kiss. "The band's a lot better
now —we can play, said Dick
Manotoba, lead vocalist and
self-proclaimed handsomest
man in rock n roll We make
people's ears bleed.
The contrast between the Dic
tators and the opening act, the
Nuns, provided a striking exam
ple of the distance that separates
the Dictators from their contem
poraries. The Nuns, a local punk
rock band, play loud, angry
music. They are scornfully
awareoftheir musical ineptness,
are proud of it.and flaunt it.
They are, however, merely a pale
imitation of the better-known
