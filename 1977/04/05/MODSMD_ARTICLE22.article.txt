Mr Billion
A 20th Century-fox release. Executive Producer GabrM Katzka, pro
duced by Steven Bach and Ken Friedman. Directed by Jonathan Kapim
Written by Kaplan and Friedman. Starring Terence HB, Valerie Perrine,
JacMe Qieaaon. Reviewed at the Old Mil Si* March 27, 1977. MPAA
rating — PG.
There are few things more irritating than lazy
directorsand screenwriters. Holding Mr. Billion in
evidence, director Jonathan Kaplan comes off as
the most blatantly careless creator of any movie
since The Cassandra Crossing.
Mr. Billion is the story of a Steve McQueen
inspired garage mechanic (Terence Hill) who in
herits a fortune, but must travel from Italy to San
Francisco by a specific date to collect it. A terrific
opportunity for the Around the World In Eighty
Days race against time, right? That's what Kaplan
thought, but he wasn't satisfied with that. Just for
fun, he threw in a greedy executive bent on procur
ing the corporation for himself (Jackie Gleason)
and a sultry opportunist (Valerie Perrine) with
loyalties more pliable than Play-Doh.®
Plasticized excitement
Nothing that happens in Mr. Billion (also called
Windfall and Scramble at various times during its
production) happens out of a logical progression
of events. On the contrary, all that happens is con
trived out of necessity for the chase, for the man
ufactured, plasticized excitement of the moment.
Kaplan treats his audience as if they were blind
dolts, gullible enough to accept the most far
fetched idiocies as charming coincidences. The
script that Kaplan and Ken Friedman shoveled
together has as much wit and imagination as un

seasoned pot roast.
The ultimately depressing thing about Mr. Bill
ion, though, is that it was obviously made by men
who love movies, men who have been brought up
on Saturday afternoon matinees, because the in
fluence of and tributes to many directors are visi
ble. Guido, the mechanic, intermittently acts out
John Wayne shoot-outs to the music of a nearby
jukebox; his favorite pastime is watching old John
Ford movies (a clip from My Darling Clementine is
thrown in).
Hitchcock
Parts of the film resemble Alfred Hitchcock's
machinations, such as the scene on the train when
Gu ido encounters Rose for the first time, not unlike
the way Gary Grant met Eva Marie Saint in North
By Northwest. Also represented are Hitchcock's
penchant for details, and his use of national
monuments combined with a fear of falling (this
time in the Grand Canyon, rather than Mt.
Rushmore).
I am reminded of the words of a disgruntled
viewer upon seeing the edited Midnight Coivboy
on television — "It was like sitting down to a steak
dinner and being served hamburger." Mr. Billion
is the same way. However well-intentioned the
film, the action by Hill, Perrine, Gleason, William
Redfield, Slim Pickens and Chill Wills is un
iformly embarrassing and the final result is a
clumsy, unbelievable, strangely unattractive bowl
of unpalatable oatmeal.

fetched idiocies as charming coincidences. The
script that Kaplan and Ken Friedman shoveled
together has as much wit and imagination as un

seasoned pot roast.
The ultimately depressing thing about Mr. Bill
ion, though, is that it was obviously made by men
who love movies, men who have been brought up
on Saturday afternoon matinees, because the in
fluence of and tributes to many directors are visi
ble. Guido, the mechanic, intermittently acts out
John Wayne shoot-outs to the music of a nearby
jukebox; his favorite pastime is watching old John
Ford movies (a clip from My Darling Clementine is
thrown in).
Hitchcock
Parts of the film resemble Alfred Hitchcock's
machinations, such as the scene on the train when
Gu ido encounters Rose for the first time, not unlike
the way Gary Grant met Eva Marie Saint in North
By Northwest. Also represented are Hitchcock's
penchant for details, and his use of national
monuments combined with a fear of falling (this
time in the Grand Canyon, rather than Mt.
Rushmore).
I am reminded of the words of a disgruntled
viewer upon seeing the edited Midnight Coivboy
on television — "It was like sitting down to a steak
dinner and being served hamburger." Mr. Billion
is the same way. However well-intentioned the
film, the action by Hill, Perrine, Gleason, William
Redfield, Slim Pickens and Chill Wills is un
iformly embarrassing and the final result is a
clumsy, unbelievable, strangely unattractive bowl
of unpalatable oatmeal.

Mr Billion
A 20th Century-fox release. Executive Producer GabrM Katzka, pro
duced by Steven Bach and Ken Friedman. Directed by Jonathan Kapim
Written by Kaplan and Friedman. Starring Terence HB, Valerie Perrine,
JacMe Qieaaon. Reviewed at the Old Mil Si* March 27, 1977. MPAA
rating — PG.
There are few things more irritating than lazy
directorsand screenwriters. Holding Mr. Billion in
evidence, director Jonathan Kaplan comes off as
the most blatantly careless creator of any movie
since The Cassandra Crossing.
Mr. Billion is the story of a Steve McQueen
inspired garage mechanic (Terence Hill) who in
herits a fortune, but must travel from Italy to San
Francisco by a specific date to collect it. A terrific
opportunity for the Around the World In Eighty
Days race against time, right? That's what Kaplan
thought, but he wasn't satisfied with that. Just for
fun, he threw in a greedy executive bent on procur
ing the corporation for himself (Jackie Gleason)
and a sultry opportunist (Valerie Perrine) with
loyalties more pliable than Play-Doh.®
Plasticized excitement
Nothing that happens in Mr. Billion (also called
Windfall and Scramble at various times during its
production) happens out of a logical progression
of events. On the contrary, all that happens is con
trived out of necessity for the chase, for the man
ufactured, plasticized excitement of the moment.
Kaplan treats his audience as if they were blind
dolts, gullible enough to accept the most far
fetched idiocies as charming coincidences. The
script that Kaplan and Ken Friedman shoveled
together has as much wit and imagination as un

seasoned pot roast.
