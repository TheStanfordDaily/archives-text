## Feiffer cartoons come alive 
### 
Q. Mr. Feiffer, where do you get ideas for your
political and psychological cartoons?
A. I sometimes overhear something in o conversa
tion; or, when I'm half asleep in the morning, I
jot down an idea; or, conversations with friends
produce an idea.
(J. How do your friends respond to being used in
your cartoons?
A. I have no friends.
The friends of Jules Feiffer (those that are left),
the Bay Area theater critics, the promoters of Feif
fer's new play, the play's performers, and the
playwright himself met for brunch at the Little Fox
Theater in San Francisco to discuss Hold me! and
with no holds barred, to exchange views on Ni
xon's forthcoming resurrection, The Unexpur
gated Memoirs of Bernard Mergendeiler, the con
sumption of feces, Harry Reems of Deep Throat,
Larry Flynt of Hustler magazine, and, inadver
tently, the honored guest's literary origins, pre
sent directions and future plans.
Hold me!, opening on April 6 at the Little Fox,
differs in two fundamental ways from Feiffer's
previous plays: first, Feiffer told us, the conceptual
basis for the play was not his idea and, second, the
work is drawn explicitly from the most outstand
ing, humorous, satirical and moving cartoons that
he has published over the last 21 years, from his
earliest days at the Village Voice.
Feiffer, fielding questions for more than an hour
before he joined us for champagne, orange juice
and French pastries, remarked that his current East
Coast hit began with a suggestion that Bernard
Mergendeiler (Feiffer's alter ego), a neurotic
middle-aged dancer,and the other denizens of his
gently insane cartoon world would provide an ex
cellent source for an assemblage of interlinked
sketches and a superb challenge for a gifted group
of actors .
Q. Nixon has been a source of endless inspiration
lor your poljtical cartoons that appear in syn
dication. What are you going to do to replace
him or resurrect him?
A. Richard Nixon is gone. (Sigh.Jl think he's com
ing back! He's been with me my entire waking
life. Thank God. He's coming back, even if I
have to do it.
Q. What do you see in Nixon's future?
A. He'll be a guest at the Carter White House before
the end of his second term. We haven't seen the
last of Nixon.
Q. Do you see any parallels between Richard
Nixon and Jimmy Carter?
A. No. But there are some parallels between Carter
and Donald Duck, and definitely between Car
ter and Alfred E. Newman.
Wearing sneakers, faded jeans, a khaki jacket,

and an open-collared shirt revealing a brown T
shirt, Feiffer looked like a harassed, middle-aged
deli owner in New York's Lower East Side, weary,
but far from exhausted, of battling the inanities of
modern society with a scathing sense of humor
and a more quietly concealed sense of the tragic.
After a very brief discussion of the current state
of theater ("1 haven't seen anything in months") to
the present state of theater of the absurd (politics,
in other words), Feiffer launched into a series of
observations about the contemporary political and
social scene, from a distinctively provincial New
York perspective.
As an introduction, Feiffer listed the sources of
news and commentary that he employs in observ
ing, criticizing and parodying American politics
and pundits: The New York Times (of course),
New York Review of Books, National Public Radio
(specifically, All Things Considered), WBAI-
Pacifica Radio (a left-wing station in New York),
and a quintet of competing political cartoonists
(Conrad, Zep in the Boston Globe, Oliphant, Peters
in Dayton, Marlett in Charlotte).
Feiffer scored the United States and the Soviet
Union, "the allegedly responsible countries," for
the nuclear threat that they posed which over
shadowed, if not eclipsed, the most extreme ac
tions of lesser states. "In the Cuban Missile Crisis, I
know I didn't trust Kennedy's finger on the button.
Did you?" heasked us. "Public and private murder
have become part of our lives. The upcoming nuc
lear war will only be the culmination of that pro
cess."
Q. How did you feel about the finding in the South
that your film, Carnal Knowledge, was
obscene?
A. Carnal Knowledge was deemed obscene in Al
bany, Georgia, by a local court. It would have
gone to the Supreme Court before being over
turned, but with movie industry backing and
two million dollars spent on it, it got First
Amendment treatment at the appeals level. . . .
Q. What are your impressions about the level of
violence on film and television?
A. The public thrives on violence, and the ante is
continually raised. In part, the demand for vio
lence is a product of what people are being led
and part society. You can't feed people shit for
many years, and be surprised when they like it.
Lighting a Canary Island cigar (Especiales 2000),
Feiffer mentioned some ongoing and future pro
jects: a detective novel (Roger Ackroyd), anima
tion and directing plays. A discretely inebriated
reporter asked, as the guests dispersed, "What do
you see as the role of critics?" Feiffer looked up
and informed us, "Critics sell tickets."
