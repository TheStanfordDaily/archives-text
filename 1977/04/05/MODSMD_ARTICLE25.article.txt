# 'Travesties' provokes and amuses
## 
### 
Oscar Wilde is arisen, but as
Tom Stoppard, author of Travesties,
which opened last week at the American
Conservatory Theatre's Geary Theater.
The ACT production scintillated, pro
voked and, above all, amused the audi
ence with a parody of art and politics of
the World War 1 era.
The play is based on historical charac
ters, revolving around the highly suspect
reminiscences of an obscure British con
sular official, named Henry Carr, who
worked in Zurich during the First World
War, Carr has encounters with James
Joyce, Lenin and Tristan Tzara, a Dadaist
artist, all of whom were supposedly liv
ing in Zurich at the time of Carr's tenure
there.
Joyce (Sydney Walker) approaches Carr
(Raye Birk) to ask his assistance in pro
ducing Oscar Wilde's The Importance of
Being Earnest. Joyce offers Carr the lead
ing role of Algernon, which Carr accepts.
Carr frequently slips into the character of
Algernon while recounting the events of
the time; thus Travesties reveals the
reason for its title, it being a rather frac
tured version of Wilde's play. Tristan
Tzara (James Winker) becomes romanti
cally involved with Carr's sister Gwendo
len (Deborah May), a librarian at the
Zurich Public Library. She is abhorred by
the anti-art of Tzara, who writes his

poems by cutting words from a book or
magazine, dropping them in a hat and
then drawing them out one at a time. So
how is it that these two become involved?
He tells her that he is Tristan's older
brother Jack. Sound familiar?
Slow start
The play got off to a slow start. Henry
Carr's long speech seemed almost too
much to handle for Birk. Later, however,
things reached a frenzied pace; especially
in the case of Winker, in what appeared to
be a case of first-night jitters. The actors
tended to rush through Stoppard's bril
liant dialogues on art and politics, which
required a little more interpretation and a
little less speed. Their timing was slightly
off as a result, but they still produced
many laughs.
The jewel of the evening was Sydney
Walker's portrayal of Joyce. He plays
Joyce as a supercilious man with a
brogue, from whom proceeds a constant
barrage of limericks. In the lively-paced
action, Walker controlled his own energy
level perfectly in every scene. His master
ful delivery and concentration highligh
ted a night of otherwise shakey acting.
Joseph Bird, as Carr's deadpan manser
vant, Bennett, must also be commended
for his performance. Bird exhibited ex
ceptional control of his body and voice.
This juxtaposed with his occasional ver

bal outbursts, added to the humor.
It is difficult to talk about characteriza
tion in the play, for all the acting takes
place inside the mind of Henry Carr. He is
the only real character; all the other actors
become caricatures who represent oppos
ing elements in his mind. Thus Carr is the
only one who can truly be evaluated for
his characterization.
Birk does an excellent job of capturing
the confusion and bewilderment of an old
and senile Carr remembering the vitality
of his younger days and trying to find a
place for himself, a common man, in his
tory.
Stoppard's play does not rest with its
plot. The plot is just a framework upon
which he has built a series of witty repar
tees about art and politics, in which Carr
represents traditional values and Tzara,
Joyce, and Lenin, new and revolutionary
ones.
The causes of the First World War seem
to have eluded even the people involved.
It was to many a meaningless conflict.
That is why it produced such people as
Joyce and Tzara who saw the world mov
ing into an age without meaning or
reason.
Overall, Travesties comes off as mental
exercise as well as entertainment. As
such, it is well worth seeing.
