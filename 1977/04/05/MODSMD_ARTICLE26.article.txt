## What does the play 'Marat/Sade' have to say to Stanford? A 						conversation with Robert Egan, director of 'Marat/Sade' 
### 
This interview with Robert Egan was conducted on Feb
ruary 26th, transcribed from tape, and revised by the par
ticipants.
Peter Weiss' 1964 play, Marat/Sade, is actually a play
within a play. The interior play, supposedly written by the
Marquis De Sade, uses as its foundation an historic event
from the French Revolution: the evening of July 13, 1793,
when the Girondist sympathizer, Charlotte Corday, mur
dered one of the Jacobin leaders, Jean Paul Marat. But,
Sade's play (really Weiss' play],is not restricted to historic
replication, for Sade has added himself to the drama, play
ing himself, to periodically interrupt the action and debate
the philosophical issues raised by Marat.
The exterior play is a drama concerning the production
of Sade's play, as performed by the inmates of the asylum of
Charenton for an audience of Parisian dignitaries on the
evening of July 13, 1808, the fifteenth anniversary of
Marat's assasination. What emerges is a very vivid por
trayal of cruel, violent and inhuman oppression by one
class over another. The whole play, therefore can be looked
upon as an allegory of class struggle in, not only the society
of 1808, but also in our own society.
Question: Unlike other interpretations of the Peter Weiss
play Marat/Sade, most notably in Peter Brook's film where
cruelty was the central focus, you have chosen to emphasize
the political and economic questions raised in the text.
Egan: 1 wouldn't say "emphasize," but more, balance those
political and economic questions in the environment of
cruelty and insanity.
Question: Marat/Sade offers the audience two alternative
perspectives on viewing man and his society, those of
Jean-Paul Marat and the Marquis De Sade. What do you feel
that each of these two main characters are saying about the
personal and societal condition of humankind, ultimately,
what does the combination of their ideas and the produc
tion as a whole offer to the audience?
Egan: Sade argues for a sort of anarchy in one's own life, an
outbreak of expression. In a basically indifferent world, he
believes that what man has to do is try to find experiences,
momentary glances of freedom which give him contact
with the vital forces within himself.
That's what Sade provides for the inmates during his
production (the play within the play). He's given them a
free moment in their horrible, indifferent worlds. He's
given them something and it's the only thing he thinks can
be given.

The agony at the end of the play is that
the inmates' only moment of freedom
has been suppressed, and those
people are beaten back down into the
pit from which they came.

What Marat offers is certainly more akin to my way of
thinking. He argues that the world is not, should not and
does not have to remain cruel, selfish and exploitative. I
think that's proved at the end of this production with the
inmates' outbreak.
What has happened is that the inmates of the asylum are
in a far worse position than when they began. They've
totally destroyed their own environment, and the guards
and nuns are certainly not going to be any easier on tfyem
after Sade's play.
Marat's words keep ringing after the play's over. "There's
got to be something more, there has to be another way." And
what he's talked about is having a focus to the revolution.
The agony at the end of the play is that the inmates' only
moment of freedom has been suppressed, and those people
are beaten back down into the pit from which they came.
The feeling 1 would have coming away from this play is
wishing someone had organized them effectively, with the
right amount of consciousness, with a focus. Confronted
with the subjugation and oppression that erupts so power
fully at the end of the production, my reaction is to say that
this must not and can not go on. In the words of Jaques
Roux, "we must take sides." I guess ultimately mine is with
Marat.
If we look at the world inside the mental institution as a
metaphor of the whole world, the inmates could have fo
cused their outbreak directly at the guards and the audi
ence, and at least begun the shock waves of a focused and
effective revolutionary threat — certainly something more
effective than the anarchy that breaks out at the end.
But Sade has structured his play in such a way that Marat
is killed and the focus is gone. So, at the end of the play,
there's energy there, there's ability, there's potential for
revolution; thfc only thing they lack is focus. In a sense, Sade
has truly reflected the history of revolutions in theWest. But
the inmate playing Marat keeps up the fight for a focused
revolution.
Question: Do you see this as a parallel of what happened in
this country during the late sixties?
Egan: I thought the 60s were a very fluctuating time, a very
chaotic time in this country, in which a lot of people were
joining a supposed revolutionary movement. But as a
movement, it lacked ideology, it lacked direction. There
was a topic, a problem, which was the Vietnam war, and
everybody attacked that particular problem. Once the war
was over, that was it.
The problem seemed to me to be much more fundamental
than just one war. The question everybody asked during the
60s was, "what is wrong with this war?" And the answer
came, "it's immoral, we're killing people in Vietnam." The
question was valid and the answers were valid.

The question everybody asked during
the '60s was "What is wrong with this
war?" The question which never
seemed to be asked in a focused way
was Why is there a Vietnam war?" and
"Why is the United States involved in
Vietnam?"

The students confronted the issue. In a very worthwhile
cause, they went about and tried to bring attention to the
war and the problems of the war. Hut the question which
never seemed to be asked in a focused way, was "why is
there a Vietnam war?"
The real question was more than just the Vietnam war. It
was why is the United States involved in Vietnam. Our
involvement was more than just a military operation; it
seemed to be more of an ideological-economic question.
We vveie there for many reasons. One of the most funda
mental reasons was the way this country is run, a capitalis
tic system trying to expand and protect its markets, and one
of its big markets, Southeast Asia, was threatened. People
don't seem to realize that Vietnam is a very important
economic area for us, in a large sense because it helps
sustain Japan, and Japan is the biggest buffer between us
and China and the whole "communist threat" of Asia.
So once the war was over, that was it. And what did we
get out of the war? Ultimately? We got a generation of
young people who could wear their hair long, wear jeans to
class — a generation radical in style but questionable in
content.

There didn't seem to be any real, focused, basic change in
people's ideological attitudes towards this country, and the
way of life in this country. The revolution didn't exist at that
level — the so-called revolution of the 60s was issue
oriented, and the issue was the Vietnam war.
Question: You say there was a lot of energy, but not really a
focus or direction. What do you think became of that prog
ressive spirit of the 60s? Has it evaporated completely, or
just gone underground?
Egan: I lived through that experience of the 60s, having
come from Boston, one of the two-big so-called revolutio
nary centers along with Berkeley. But practically all my
friends who were associated with that revolutionary
movement are now out of it. In those days, one thing very
few people saw was the strong material inducements of the
capitalistic system in this country.
Once the Vietnam war was over, once that issue was
resolved, everybody sort of forgot about their revolutionary
consciousness. That generation passed through the war, out
of the university, and then saw that they had to think about
new things: jobs, money, supporting families. All that re
volutionary fervor subsided.
Question: So, do you feel that the revolutionary spirit has
not just gone underground, but that the leaders in the 60s
have effectively soldout?
Egan: "Soldout" might be a little too harsh. Again, the
inducements of capitalism are so heavy that people didn't
really sell out, but rather, eased into the accepted way of
life. Had they stayed with some sort of revolutionary men
tality, they would have found themselves very much alone,
beating their heads against very thick brick walls.
So, 1 think what we find now is a lot of those re
volutionaries, or so-called revolutionaries, have filtered
into areas of American culture where they now work on,
again, issue-oriented causes. I feel that we must ask and 1
confront the more fundamental, ideological questions un
derlying the issues. Unless this sort of analysis and ideolog
ical questioning is undertaken we will be forever trying to
clean up certain manifestations of a sickness rather than
curing the disease.
Question: Even though Vietnam has passed, you feel the
sickness is still with us today?

Marat doesn't talk about people who
have been beaten down and directly
told to think this or that He talks about
an indirect institutional repression. The
same thing goes on in America.

Egan: Definitely. In fact, the contradictions in the world are
much more apparent now, than in the 60s. And. 1 also feel
that awareness of our and other ideologies is beginning to
seep in now. America seems to be an island all alone. But,
whether or not we're aware of it, we do have an ideology,
and it's an ingrained, hard-core capitalistic ideology.
The episode in Marat/Sade entitled "Marat's Liturgy"
shows Marat talking about a kind of people much like
Americans are today. In that passage, Marat doesn't talk
about people who have been beaten down and directly told
to think this or that. He talks about an indirect institutional
repression. The same thing on here in America.
We live in a system where institutions don't tell us
explicitly what to think nor exactly how to act, but it's still
ingrained into all of us, through our education system, our
job markets, etc. We are slowly indoctrinated into believing
in and accepting the capitalistic way of life, and viable
alternatives are effectively suppressed.
Question: How do you see an alternative? Perhaps estab
lishing an alternative consciousness at a more fundamental
level?
Egan: The underlying base of world activity is economic.
What ultimately determines the way we live, the way we
relate socially, is economic. Springing out of that base is a
super-structure which comprises the mental attitudes and
institutions of society.
So the only way to fundamentally :hange that social
structure is to change this base. Now you either go back and
change that base directly, or you try toch; nge it through the
super-structure.
I see art as one element of the super-structure. Hopefully
through my art I can reflect the contradictions that exist
between areas of that super-structure, or between the
super-structure and the base; and hopefully bring about a
new consciousness or make some little dent iomeplace, so
people will say "yes, there are contradictions — fundamen
tal wrongs existing in our society."
Hopefully, one can ultimately swing people back the way
— the only way — we can really change our society, our
system, and that is to change our base.
Question: Do you think your production of Mcirat/Sade pre
sented some of those alternatives?
Egan: Yes, definitely. What I hope the play did is raise
questions, and say "there are other ways to look at the
world." I think if anything, Marat/Sade does that. It jolts us
out of our complacency.
The play presents two strong alternatives to complacency
in the world, Sadeand Marat, both of whom are very jolting.
Both of them are craving in their desire for an alternative,
and for real contact between human beings.
They differ from each other in how they believe that that
contact, that new awareness, that new communication is
going to come about. Sade believes it must initially coin' 1
from an internal self-exploration, and Marat, from an exter
nal social revolution. But, neither man adheres to nor es
pouses a capitalistic ideology.
Question: To present what might be Sade's argument: do
you think these ills of society are as simple as politics, can
the source of the problem be reduced to merely the

capitalistic structure? Or is it something more fundamental
about mankind, the whole rational structure of our civiliza
tion, as opposed to simply the economic structure of our
society?
Egan: Well, for me politics is economics. But one must take
a basic view of the world that really does integrate subjec
tive, personal problems with the objective, rational, social
world. All of those problems spring ultimately from one
base, which is an economic base. And this is not a simple
answer, but one that is dialectic and very complicated.
Marxism, for instance, is a science tbat views human
relations, and sees that the most basic problem all men face
is how they're going to make a living. That is the economic
base; we all grow up out of that. All of our involvement, our
progress, our lack of progress, all evolves from how men are
going to make their living, and how that economic structure
effects social relations.
Marxism springs from that. It sees economics as the base,
or catalyst, to the movement of mankind. Not the only base,
but certainly and ultimately the most important dialectical
determinant. So, we must begin to understand and analyze
the economic movement, the history of economics, the his
tory of how mankind has progressed, and finally, why he
has progressed.
Again we can point to the 60s. There didn't seem to be the
necessary developed ideological sophistication (for what
ever reason I don't know) to ask the question "why the
Vietnam war?" or even begin to analyze that question
through a coherent movement.
No, I don't agree with Sade. He seemed to have, in this
particular play, a very partial view of mankind. It's too easy
to say that man is basically selfish, animalistic, ruled by his
vital passions and forces.
Sade says that's just the way it is. And no matter what we
do history will always move in these vicious cycles, no
matter what society we have, no matter what social struc
ture we have. He believes man will never have a social
structure which enables him to, not only get in touch with
his inner self, but also to make that inner self protective,
communal and in contact with other people.
Sade believes progress can only occur by man alone in
self-exploration. If I agreed with Sade and felt like that
about mankind, then 1 wouldn't be committed to drama.
Question: Do you now not consider yourself a part of the
capitalistic system?
Egan: I'm certainly a part of the capitalistic system. I've
come out of it. I see myself as someone who lives in the West
and is a member of the West. Just as Weiss, who also lives in
the West.
He's a German who lives in Sweden. He left Germany
during theSecond World War.But Weiss said ' (me time he
doesn't want to live in the East, because he doesn't feel they
come any closer to this Marxist idea we'n diking about
than the West does. Also, he has a commitnn it to the West,
this being the culture and civilization that lie's from.
If I'm going to get the education that's going to put me in a
position where I can be involved with theatre and do some
thing worthwhile, such as direct plays like Marat/Sade,
then I've got to develop a strategy where I can grow, in terms
of education, read what I want, and still make a living. But
also, hone my own ideology while learning as much as I
can.
Then, ultimately, I would hope to get in the position
where I can become a small force in my own way, where I
can begin to bring about changes in consciousness, im
provement in the society in which we live.
Question: If your goals are essentially to communicate to
people about these ideas, then why are you in theatre? At
least in this day and age, theatre is probably more of an
upper-class art, and certainly less far-reaching on a mass
level than other arts, such as film or music.
Egan: Well, that's a problem. Each individual has his own
subjective talents and abilities. Mine happen to be in
theatre. I feel good doing theatre. I think it's inmyblood, it's
what I do better than anything else. I could do other things,
but I think media in this country — television, film, even
theatre — pfobably has the greatest impact upon con
sciousness. Art forms always have, among people of all
social classes.

As an artist, I think there has to be
someone who communicates to the
middle and upper-middle classes of
our social fabric, trying to develop a
new consciousness there also.

And I think theatre is the most immediate of all art forms,
even more than film. Someone came to me after they'd seen
the show and told me that they thought the human suffering
and oppression inMarat/Sode were more real than any they
had ever seen on film. When I asked why, they said because
there were real people right in front of them, right there,
experiencing that violence and cruelty, and it made it much
more real. That's why I love theatre; it's real people right in
front of you experiencing.
As far as elitism goes, I would hope that theatre in this
country would change. We're working against a tradition
where theatre has never really been an integral part of the
culture.
People like Peter Weiss or left-wing university profes
sors, for instance, who teach or write books, would also be
considered elitist because they relate to an elitist, educated
audience. But. each man has to do not only what he does
best, but also work in the area that he feels he can function
most effectively.
Hopefully, someday in this country, with people working
in that intellectual realm teaching and communicating to

the youth that will ultimately run this country, the merging
of the classes of society will take place. There must he
people working in factories, theatres, universities — all
areas of the super-structure — in order to truly and com
prehensively bring about needed change for a better society
for all.
Question: So you consider it your function to work within
the middle and upper-middle classes of this country?
Egan: No, not exclusively by any means. But 1 think there
has to be someone who communicates to that part of our
social fabric, trying to develop a new consciousness there,
working to raise new questions and begin to analyze this
world in a new way. If that doesn't happen, then the possi
bility of any real change coming will be delayed and frag
mented.
Art points out contradictions that already exist in the
society, it doesn't create the contradictions 1 feel as an
artist, my main responsibility is to reflect the world as it is
today. You can't reflect a world that doesn't exist here. The
artist hopes that by pointing out the contradictions, point
ing out the determinants that affect our lives, then you can
make people aware of the actual, real situation in which
they are presently living.

What I feel too often happens at Stan
ford with the sort of art that is presented
here, theatre included, is that people
shy away from the real determinants
that shape our society.

What I feel toobften happens at Stanford with the sort of
art that is presented here, theatre included, is that people
shy away from the reality, people shy away from the con
tradictions, people shy away from the real determinants.
People don't want to face them so they offer what 1 con
sider self-indulgent or escapist forms of art.
What we need are committed artists that want to go back
and reflect the world as it is. You hope somehow if you
show those contradictions, they will become bigger and
bigger, and ultimately the contradictions will become so
apparent and so great that there's nothing people can do but
face them and do something about them.
Question: Marat presents an alternative, a system which
follows similar lines as Marxism, calling for fundamental
changes at the base of society. . . .
Egan: Essentially what Marat is saying is that "1 don't want
any part of that inequ itable, capitalistic pie you have to offer
me; 1 want a new pie brought out. It may not be as big, but
it's going to be more humanly and equally divided." Weiss
was honest, he reflected reality the way it is: we've never
really seen a new pie brought out, here in the West, and we
don't see it in the play either.
Question: The play is, on one level, a comment on cruelt\J
and violent oppression. Yet, Marat calls for violence as i*
necessary component of revolution. Are you aligned withj!
Marat's ideology to the extent that he refers to when h(J
advocates that "we can't begin to build until we've burnt
the old building down?"
Egan: It's a question of how you burn them down.
Question: How do you think they should be burned down?
In the end, how large a role will violence play in the inevit
able revolution in this country? a
Egan: It's a difficult question because we've never reached .»
point in any sort of socialist revolutionary development in
this country where any of us have been forced to choose
where we stand when it comes down to extended violence.'
It's like what the character Jacques Roux says at the end of
the play, "when will you learn to take sides?" Some people
have taken sides but the socio-economic situation is no|
critical enough at this moment for battle lines to be drawn.'
But, when it comes right down to it, when it comes to a
class of people realizing "we don't have anything — w<|
want what you have — we want that wealth spread out.'.'
and those other people having to give up their material
power that they've had for generations, then it's going to
come down to violence. I can't see it happening peacefully!
There's going to be some violence involved, as there was in
France in 1789, in China in the 20th century, and just
recently in Chile.
Question: How close at hand is that new age. perhaps even
the next revolution? Is that spirit which revealed itself in
the 60s going to rise again in the 80s, perhaps the 90s, as <j
more progressive and focused, more ideological move*
ment?
Egan: That's obviously impossible to answer.
Question: I know, that's why I asked you.
Egan: You talk to people involved in various left-wing
groups around this country and they'll tell you it's right
around the corner, next week. The capitalistic structures of
Vietnam and Cambodia fell, but I can't see that happening
in this country. The system is operating too effectively and
efficiently right now.
Until the capitalistic system cannot provide the goods
anymore that it has up until this point, until a significant
number of people are out of jobs, until they don't have that
money, until we begin to see a real breakdown in this
system, any revolution is doomed to failure, because they're
always going to be getting what they want, which is basic
economic satisfaction.
But I think we're seeing it break down now around the
world — now, in the 70s, in the whole global structure.
That's one reason why Morcit/Sude was so appeal ing to me;
because it's such a global play. It's about the world, and
more particularly, it's about the West.
What the audience probably feels at the end of this play,
hopefully, is that there is real power existing in the West, all
around us, and someday it may erupt. I think ultimately
what the play says is that someday people are going tq
have to take sides.
MuratlSude reflects the reality of the world today, where
there is oppression, and it shows us that there are two
alternatives that are true today. There's a Marquis De Sade
alternative, and there's a Jean-Paul Marat alternative. Those!
are the big alternatives we face today. People have to bo
aware of those alternatives and do something about them.,
