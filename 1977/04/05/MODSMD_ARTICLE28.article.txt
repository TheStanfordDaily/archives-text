State can't restrict water flow
San Francisco — California may not restrict
t he flow of river water to federal dam and water
projects, a federal appeals court ruled yester
day.
Dealing environmentalists another blow in
the protracted battle over the New Melones
□am, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a 1975 decision by District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride of Sacramento.
Macßride ruled the U.S. Bureau ot Reclama
tion could take water from the Stanislaus River
for filling the reservoir behind the dam,
scheduled for completion next year.
The state had argued that Congress meant for
federal agencies to follow state laws in build
ing federal dams.
Environmentalists claimed the wildwater
rapids on the Stanislaus would be tamed if the
federal government is allowed to fill the reser
voir.
John Bryson, Cov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s ap
pointee as chairman of the state Water Re
sources Control Board, said it was "very
likely" the state will appeal the ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
Congress sent President Jimmy Carter a bill
yesterday authorizing $100 million for
drought assistance in the West and upper
Midwest.
Under the measure, farmers in certain irriga
tion districts could sell their surplus water toa
"water bank" where other farmers, who need it
more, could purchase it. The government
would subsidize the payments.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), the Senate
sponsor, urged colleagues to support the
House version, contending it was favored by
the Carter administration and it was
emergency legislation.
Jet crashes, explodes, kills 72
New Hope, Ga. — A DC-9 jet, battered by

lightning and hail, crashed and exploded into
flames yesterday, killing at least 72 persons as
the pilot tried to make an emergency landing
on a country road.
The plane carried 81 passengers and a crew
of four.
Moments before the crash, the pilot reported
that his windshield was cracked and that both
engines were out, according to the Federal Av
iation Administration (FAA).
He was trying to get to Dobbins Air Force
Base at Marietta to make an emergency landing
but didn't make it, the FAA said.
"It was an apparently severe thunderstorm,
the turbulence was pretty bad," said Don Fos
ter, a licensed pilot and passenger aboard the
Southern Airways jet, bound from Muscle
Shoals and Huntsville, Ala., to Atlanta.
"When the hail was at its worst, lightning
struck the left wing tip and 1 guess apparently
that knocked the power out. It knocked some
thing out," said Foster.
Floods, tornadoes hit deep South
Atlanta, Ga. — With little warning, heavy
spring rains triggered massive flooding in
three states yesterday and high winds or tor
nados hit three others, leaving at least 21 per
sons dead and thousands homeless.
Long-time residents said flooding in parts of
Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia was the
worst they could remember.
In southeastern Kentucky, with six inches of
rain recorded and more expected, the Cumber
land River was rising two feet an hour and was
expected to smash records and crest 12 to 16
feet over flood stage.
When the Tug Fork River and numerous
streams in southern West Virginia went over
their banks, they washed several houses and
mobile homes away. And in Virginia, hun
dreds of families were evacuated from flooded
homes in the state's mountainous southwest
sector.

High winds and tornados struck sections of
Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia, killing over
20 people and causing moderate to heavy
property damage.
In all three states, unitsoftheNational Guard
were called out for evacuation and rescue duty.
Nantucket threatens secession
Nantucket. Mass. — Islanders angered by
mainland control of their political well-being
voted yesterday in a non-binding referendum
on whether to secede from the state ot Mas
sachusetts.
The threat of secession is a reaction to the
Massachusetts legislature's proposal to redis
trict itself so that the island and neighboring
Martha's Vineyard would lose their own rep
resentative for the first time since 1696.
Under reapportionment, scheduled for de
bate soon, the islands would be merged with
Cape Cod in a district of 300,000 persons and
one representative. The two islands have only
13,000 permanent residents, and islanders fi
gure only Cape Cod candidates could ever be
elected.
"Taxation without representation," cried
one of the earliest voters, Paul Morris, a New
York advertising man turned marine historian.
Morris is typical of the numerous city folk who
have retired permanently amid this island's
6000 year-round inhabitants.
Islanders say the isolation of Nantucket and
Martha's Vineyard requires special representa
tion.
Bumper stickers blossomed yesterday on is
land automobiles: "In our need, we must sea
cede."
Nazis quiet during Passover
San Francisco — Across the street from the
boarded-up Nazi bookstore that spawned a

weekend of neighborhood violence, about 100
Jews celebrated Passover yesterday in a
synagogue founded by survivors of German
concentration camps.
The handful of Nazis, who stirred up emo
tions when the store opened last week by
marching in the streets wearing brown un
iforms with swastika arm bands, were nowhere
in sight.
"They've crawled back into the gutter from
which they came," said Rabbi Theodore Ale
xander of the Temple B'nai Emu nab, across the
street.
Alexander said he tried to stop a mob of 100
people who stormed the bookstore Friday
night, breaking down the door, and throwing
anti-Semitic literature into the streets.
None of the 800 Jews in his congregation
took part in the violence, Alexander said. "We
were caught in the cross-fire."
Alexander also termed the Nazi party "a
lunatic fringe with not more than 20 members
in San Francisco."
Clean air guards to be reviewed
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide how far the government
can go to make sure the nation's cleanest air
gets no dirtier.
The justices voted to hear an appeal by many
industries that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appe
als in Washington, D.C., made a mistake when
it ruled that the Environmental Protection
Agency has broad authority in guarding clean
air.
The industry representatives claim that the
strict clean-air regulations will prohibit man
ufacturing growth by limiting the number of
new plants that can be constructed.
The regulations, if allowed to stand, could
cause the nation to lose "its struggle to obtain
energy self-sufficiency," the industry rep
resentatives said.

Under the 1970 Clean Air Act. some air pol
lution is allowed.
Amendments to the act, however, were used
by the EPA to order states to protect t hose areas
with better air quality than allowed under the
act. Those areas should not be subjected to
"significant deterioration," the EPA has or
dered.
Most of the clean-air areas are located in
rural states or in states historically free of
heavy manufacturing.
When the federal agency issued its stan
dards, it included only pollution from sulfur
dioxide and particulate matter, pollutants
most often associated with coal-burning power
plants. Industry representatives sued to strike
down the standards for the two pollutants.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with fog or low
clouds along the coast extending inland nights
and mornings. Cooler. Lows tonight in the mid
40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the upper
50s along the coast and in the 60s to low 70s
inland. Variable winds to 15 mph.

"It was an apparently severe thunderstorm,

Southern Airways jet, bound from Muscle
Shoals and Huntsville, Ala., to Atlanta.
"When the hail was at its worst, lightning

Floods, tornadoes hit deep South
Atlanta, Ga. — With little warning, heavy
spring rains triggered massive flooding in
three states yesterday and high winds or tor
nados hit three others, leaving at least 21 per
sons dead and thousands homeless.
Long-time residents said flooding in parts of
Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia was the
worst they could remember.
In southeastern Kentucky, with six inches of
rain recorded and more expected, the Cumber
land River was rising two feet an hour and was
expected to smash records and crest 12 to 16
feet over flood stage.
When the Tug Fork River and numerous
streams in southern West Virginia went over
their banks, they washed several houses and
mobile homes away. And in Virginia, hun
dreds of families were evacuated from flooded
homes in the state's mountainous southwest
sector.

High winds and tornados struck sections of
Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia, killing over
20 people and causing moderate to heavy
property damage.
In all three states, unitsoftheNational Guard
were called out for evacuation and rescue duty.
Nantucket threatens secession
Nantucket. Mass. — Islanders angered by
mainland control of their political well-being
voted yesterday in a non-binding referendum
on whether to secede from the state ot Mas
sachusetts.
The threat of secession is a reaction to the
Massachusetts legislature's proposal to redis
trict itself so that the island and neighboring
Martha's Vineyard would lose their own rep
resentative for the first time since 1696.
Under reapportionment, scheduled for de
bate soon, the islands would be merged with
Cape Cod in a district of 300,000 persons and
one representative. The two islands have only
13,000 permanent residents, and islanders fi
gure only Cape Cod candidates could ever be
elected.
"Taxation without representation," cried
one of the earliest voters, Paul Morris, a New
York advertising man turned marine historian.
Morris is typical of the numerous city folk who
have retired permanently amid this island's
6000 year-round inhabitants.
Islanders say the isolation of Nantucket and
Martha's Vineyard requires special representa
tion.
Bumper stickers blossomed yesterday on is
land automobiles: "In our need, we must sea

Nazis quiet during Passover
San Francisco — Across the street from the
boarded-up Nazi bookstore that spawned a

weekend of neighborhood violence, about 100
Jews celebrated Passover yesterday in a
synagogue founded by survivors of German
concentration camps.
The handful of Nazis, who stirred up emo
tions when the store opened last week by
marching in the streets wearing brown un
iforms with swastika arm bands, were nowhere
in sight.
"They've crawled back into the gutter from
which they came," said Rabbi Theodore Ale
xander of the Temple B'nai Emu nab, across the
street.
Alexander said he tried to stop a mob of 100
people who stormed the bookstore Friday
night, breaking down the door, and throwing
anti-Semitic literature into the streets.
None of the 800 Jews in his congregation
took part in the violence, Alexander said. "We
were caught in the cross-fire."
Alexander also termed the Nazi party "a
lunatic fringe with not more than 20 members
in San Francisco."
Clean air guards to be reviewed
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide how far the government
can go to make sure the nation's cleanest air
gets no dirtier.
The justices voted to hear an appeal by many
industries that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appe
als in Washington, D.C., made a mistake when
it ruled that the Environmental Protection
Agency has broad authority in guarding clean
air.
The industry representatives claim that the
strict clean-air regulations will prohibit man
ufacturing growth by limiting the number of
new plants that can be constructed.
The regulations, if allowed to stand, could
cause the nation to lose "its struggle to obtain
energy self-sufficiency," the industry rep
resentatives said.

Under the 1970 Clean Air Act. some air pol
lution is allowed.
Amendments to the act, however, were used
by the EPA to order states to protect t hose areas
with better air quality than allowed under the
act. Those areas should not be subjected to
"significant deterioration," the EPA has or
dered.
Most of the clean-air areas are located in
rural states or in states historically free of
heavy manufacturing.
When the federal agency issued its stan
dards, it included only pollution from sulfur
dioxide and particulate matter, pollutants
most often associated with coal-burning power
plants. Industry representatives sued to strike
down the standards for the two pollutants.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with fog or low
clouds along the coast extending inland nights
and mornings. Cooler. Lows tonight in the mid
40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the upper
50s along the coast and in the 60s to low 70s
inland. Variable winds to 15 mph.
State can't restrict water flow
San Francisco — California may not restrict
t he flow of river water to federal dam and water
projects, a federal appeals court ruled yester
day.
Dealing environmentalists another blow in
the protracted battle over the New Melones
□am, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a 1975 decision by District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride of Sacramento.
Macßride ruled the U.S. Bureau ot Reclama
tion could take water from the Stanislaus River
for filling the reservoir behind the dam,
scheduled for completion next year.
The state had argued that Congress meant for
federal agencies to follow state laws in build
ing federal dams.
Environmentalists claimed the wildwater
rapids on the Stanislaus would be tamed if the
federal government is allowed to fill the reser
voir.
John Bryson, Cov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s ap
pointee as chairman of the state Water Re
sources Control Board, said it was "very
likely" the state will appeal the ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
Congress sent President Jimmy Carter a bill
yesterday authorizing $100 million for
drought assistance in the West and upper
Midwest.
Under the measure, farmers in certain irriga
tion districts could sell their surplus water toa
"water bank" where other farmers, who need it
more, could purchase it. The government
would subsidize the payments.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), the Senate
sponsor, urged colleagues to support the
House version, contending it was favored by
the Carter administration and it was
emergency legislation.

Nazis quiet during Passover
San Francisco — Across the street from the
boarded-up Nazi bookstore that spawned a

weekend of neighborhood violence, about 100
Jews celebrated Passover yesterday in a
synagogue founded by survivors of German
concentration camps.
The handful of Nazis, who stirred up emo
tions when the store opened last week by
marching in the streets wearing brown un
iforms with swastika arm bands, were nowhere
in sight.
"They've crawled back into the gutter from
which they came," said Rabbi Theodore Ale
xander of the Temple B'nai Emu nab, across the
street.
Alexander said he tried to stop a mob of 100
people who stormed the bookstore Friday
night, breaking down the door, and throwing
anti-Semitic literature into the streets.
None of the 800 Jews in his congregation
took part in the violence, Alexander said. "We
were caught in the cross-fire."
Alexander also termed the Nazi party "a
lunatic fringe with not more than 20 members
in San Francisco."
Clean air guards to be reviewed
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide how far the government
can go to make sure the nation's cleanest air
gets no dirtier.
The justices voted to hear an appeal by many
industries that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appe
als in Washington, D.C., made a mistake when
it ruled that the Environmental Protection
Agency has broad authority in guarding clean
air.
The industry representatives claim that the
strict clean-air regulations will prohibit man
ufacturing growth by limiting the number of
new plants that can be constructed.
The regulations, if allowed to stand, could
cause the nation to lose "its struggle to obtain
energy self-sufficiency," the industry rep
resentatives said.

Under the 1970 Clean Air Act. some air pol
lution is allowed.
Amendments to the act, however, were used
by the EPA to order states to protect t hose areas
with better air quality than allowed under the
act. Those areas should not be subjected to
"significant deterioration," the EPA has or
dered.
Most of the clean-air areas are located in
rural states or in states historically free of
heavy manufacturing.
When the federal agency issued its stan
dards, it included only pollution from sulfur
dioxide and particulate matter, pollutants
most often associated with coal-burning power
plants. Industry representatives sued to strike
down the standards for the two pollutants.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with fog or low
clouds along the coast extending inland nights
and mornings. Cooler. Lows tonight in the mid
40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the upper
50s along the coast and in the 60s to low 70s
inland. Variable winds to 15 mph.
State can't restrict water flow
San Francisco — California may not restrict
t he flow of river water to federal dam and water
projects, a federal appeals court ruled yester
day.
Dealing environmentalists another blow in
the protracted battle over the New Melones
□am, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a 1975 decision by District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride of Sacramento.
Macßride ruled the U.S. Bureau ot Reclama
tion could take water from the Stanislaus River
for filling the reservoir behind the dam,
scheduled for completion next year.
The state had argued that Congress meant for
federal agencies to follow state laws in build
ing federal dams.
Environmentalists claimed the wildwater
rapids on the Stanislaus would be tamed if the
federal government is allowed to fill the reser
voir.
John Bryson, Cov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s ap
pointee as chairman of the state Water Re
sources Control Board, said it was "very
likely" the state will appeal the ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
Congress sent President Jimmy Carter a bill
yesterday authorizing $100 million for
drought assistance in the West and upper
Midwest.
Under the measure, farmers in certain irriga
tion districts could sell their surplus water toa
"water bank" where other farmers, who need it
more, could purchase it. The government
would subsidize the payments.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), the Senate
sponsor, urged colleagues to support the
House version, contending it was favored by
the Carter administration and it was
emergency legislation.
Jet crashes, explodes, kills 72
New Hope, Ga. — A DC-9 jet, battered by

lightning and hail, crashed and exploded into
flames yesterday, killing at least 72 persons as
the pilot tried to make an emergency landing
on a country road.
The plane carried 81 passengers and a crew
of four.
Moments before the crash, the pilot reported
that his windshield was cracked and that both
engines were out, according to the Federal Av
iation Administration (FAA).
He was trying to get to Dobbins Air Force
Base at Marietta to make an emergency landing
but didn't make it, the FAA said.
"It was an apparently severe thunderstorm,
the turbulence was pretty bad," said Don Fos
ter, a licensed pilot and passenger aboard the
Southern Airways jet, bound from Muscle
Shoals and Huntsville, Ala., to Atlanta.
"When the hail was at its worst, lightning
struck the left wing tip and 1 guess apparently
that knocked the power out. It knocked some
thing out," said Foster.
Floods, tornadoes hit deep South
Atlanta, Ga. — With little warning, heavy
spring rains triggered massive flooding in
three states yesterday and high winds or tor
nados hit three others, leaving at least 21 per
sons dead and thousands homeless.
Long-time residents said flooding in parts of
Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia was the
worst they could remember.
In southeastern Kentucky, with six inches of
rain recorded and more expected, the Cumber
land River was rising two feet an hour and was
expected to smash records and crest 12 to 16
feet over flood stage.
When the Tug Fork River and numerous
streams in southern West Virginia went over
their banks, they washed several houses and
mobile homes away. And in Virginia, hun
dreds of families were evacuated from flooded
homes in the state's mountainous southwest
sector.

High winds and tornados struck sections of
Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia, killing over
20 people and causing moderate to heavy
property damage.
In all three states, unitsoftheNational Guard
were called out for evacuation and rescue duty.
Nantucket threatens secession
Nantucket. Mass. — Islanders angered by
mainland control of their political well-being
voted yesterday in a non-binding referendum
on whether to secede from the state ot Mas
sachusetts.
The threat of secession is a reaction to the
Massachusetts legislature's proposal to redis
trict itself so that the island and neighboring
Martha's Vineyard would lose their own rep
resentative for the first time since 1696.
Under reapportionment, scheduled for de
bate soon, the islands would be merged with
Cape Cod in a district of 300,000 persons and
one representative. The two islands have only

strict clean-air regulations will prohibit man
ufacturing growth by limiting the number of
new plants that can be constructed.
The regulations, if allowed to stand, could
cause the nation to lose "its struggle to obtain
energy self-sufficiency," the industry rep
resentatives said.

Under the 1970 Clean Air Act. some air pol
lution is allowed.
Amendments to the act, however, were used
by the EPA to order states to protect t hose areas
with better air quality than allowed under the
act. Those areas should not be subjected to
"significant deterioration," the EPA has or
dered.
Most of the clean-air areas are located in
rural states or in states historically free of
heavy manufacturing.
When the federal agency issued its stan
dards, it included only pollution from sulfur
dioxide and particulate matter, pollutants
most often associated with coal-burning power
plants. Industry representatives sued to strike
down the standards for the two pollutants.
