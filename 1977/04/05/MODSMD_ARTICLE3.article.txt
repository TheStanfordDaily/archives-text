Fee assessments for Council of Pres
idents (COP) salaries and the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band will not be on the spring ballot as
a result of ASSU Senate action last
night.
The Band failed to submit financial
statements required by the By-Laws
before the senate may decide whether
to place a fee assessment on the bal lot.
Sen. John Barth requested the rules be
suspended to allow a vote on the
Band's request but he failed to get the
approval of the senate.
The Band may now go before the
Senate Finance Committee and re
quest funds or go before the full senate
asking the senate to approve a special
election for a Band fee assessment.
The COP salary resolution failed be
cause it did not have the required two
thirds vote needed to place it on the
ballot.
The Senate had voted on March 7 to
place both the COP and guest profes
sorship board fee assessments on the
ballot but both were reconsidered last
night due to ambiguities in the senate
procedure.
Sharp overruled
Senate Chairman Dave Sharp ini
tially ruled the measures should be al

lowed on the ballot as they had been
originally voted. The senate, however,
voted to overrule his decision and to
reconsider the matter.
The resolutions were reintroduced
and the senate supported the COP sal
ary measure, 9-8. The measure was de
feated because the vote was less than
the required two-thirds majority. The
fee assessment for the guest professor
ship board passed 5-3.
The senate also acted on several
proposals stemming from a SWOPSI
class designed to stimulate recom
mendations for ASSU Senate reform.
COP Vice president Carole Houck
introduced seven constitutional
amendments, six of which will appear
on the spring ballot for a student vote.
Restructuring constitution
Five of the proposals would restruc
ture the current COP from a body hav
ing a president and three vice presi
dents to a body having four co
presidents. Under the proposed
amendments, it would take three of the
co-presidents to veto a measure passed
by the senate. All of the proposals pas
sed by substantial margins.
Another proposal would eliminate
the current ASSU Nominations Com
mittee contingent upon the senate's
passage of a by-laws change which

would establish a Committee on
Committees. The proposal passed
unanimously.
The last proposal by Houck called
for a constitutional amendment to de
signate a member of the COP as
senate chairman.
The controversial proposal failed by
a vote of 7-6 — again, less than the two
thirds majority needed.
Wasting a member
Sen. Dan Livingston opposed the
measure saying that "tying down one

of the COP members to the senate is a
waste of a COP member." Sen. Doug
Bandow said he felt the COP member
and the senate "might not get along."
He added the proposal was ambiguous
because it did not specifically outline
the selection process for choosing
which COP member would serve as
chairman.
Houck said she hoped the senate
would "trust the judgment of the
class" after they had spent "consider
able" time "weighing the pros and

cons."
In other business,
—Rainer Newberry, Bob Gregory
and Meriel Hurtle were elected to fill
three positions that had been open on
the nominations committee.
—The senate alloted $200 plus the
portion of the senate's discretionary
fund left over at the end of the school
year, to the Committee on Childcare to
be used to finance a child care facility
in Escondido Village.
