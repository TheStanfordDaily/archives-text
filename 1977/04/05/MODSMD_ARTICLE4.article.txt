# Health codes delay student pizzeria
## Italian House plans postponed until fall 
### Frances Draper 
The University has approved a stu
dent group's plan for an Italian piz
zeria in the Italian Studies House, but
the pizzeria may not open before next
fall because of unforeseen problems
with county health and safety codes,
according to junior Matt Cobb, head of
the group.
The kitchen floor must be tested for
stress, certain safety features must be
met and the oven must be inspected
after installation, Cobb reported.
"We had hoped to get the pizzeria
started this quarter," he said, "but we
have had to put it off to the beginning
of next fall quarter."
Cobb, an Italian House resident, first
conceived of the idea for a pizzeria at
the end of fall quarter.
Creperie
The pizzeria will operate along the
lines of the French Studies House's
creperie, Cobb said. While the Alpha
Delts' pizza operation is profit
oriented, he said, the Italian House
pizzeria will try to make persons here
aware of t he programs the house offers.
While Cobb was studying at
Stanford-in-Florence last year, he vis
ited many pizzerias and talked to the
chefs.
"We are going to try to make the
pizzeria here similar to Da I'as
qualino's in Naples," Cobb said. "The
pizzas will be plate-size servings with
thin crust, Italian-style toppings and.
best of all," he added, "they'll be
cheap."
The main problem for the Italian
House is that the kitchen oven cannot
go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which
is not hot enough to make good pizza,
according to Cobb. So with the help of
three other Italian House residents,
Hall Kent, Mark Nassutti and Joe Wu,
Cobb formed a group to attack the
problem.
Project approved
The house residents approved the
project as a good means of making
house goals known on campus. Asst.
Row Office Director Tom Hornbeak

also gave his approval to the project.
According to Cobb, the next step
was to approach University Food Ser
vice Manager Maxine Anderson. Not
only does the Food Service have ulti
mate control over the kitchen in the
Italian House, but Anderson also per
sonally designed that particular
kitchen.
At first she was quite concerned
about the effects of the project on the
kitchen, Cobb said, but "ultimately she
offered to help us acquire an oven."
Thebiggest obstacle, however, was a
University energy moratorium on new
energy-consuming devices on cam

pus, Cobb said.
"We had to convince the University
Housing Office that the oven wouldn't
use that much energy and that we
could compensate for the energy used
by putting butterfly valves on the nor
mal gas oven to cut down on the gas
used."
Director of University Housing Fd
ward Scoles said, "When I first heard
the idea I was concerned about what
seemed to be a new energy-user, but as
I understand it, it would mean a net
gain because the pizza oven would re
quire less energy than the normal
oven."

Scoles said he would not have ap
proved the project if it had needed
University funding. Cobb said the
group is trying to raise enough money
from students in the house and com
munity supporters of the house. They
are also applying for the Pierce Memo
rial Award which annually gives $750
to a student project which will benefit
the community.
"They're doing a very good job of
investigating all angles of this pro
ject," said Scoles.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Norman Robinson has also given
his approval to the project.

the pizzeria may not open before next
fall because of unforeseen problems
with county health and safety codes,
according to junior Matt Cobb, head of
the group.
The kitchen floor must be tested for
stress, certain safety features must be
met and the oven must be inspected
after installation, Cobb reported.
"We had hoped to get the pizzeria
started this quarter," he said, "but we
have had to put it off to the beginning
of next fall quarter."
Cobb, an Italian House resident, first
conceived of the idea for a pizzeria at
the end of fall quarter.
Creperie
The pizzeria will operate along the
lines of the French Studies House's
creperie, Cobb said. While the Alpha
Delts' pizza operation is profit
oriented, he said, the Italian House
pizzeria will try to make persons here
aware of t he programs the house offers.
While Cobb was studying at
Stanford-in-Florence last year, he vis
ited many pizzerias and talked to the
chefs.
"We are going to try to make the
pizzeria here similar to Da I'as
qualino's in Naples," Cobb said. "The
pizzas will be plate-size servings with
thin crust, Italian-style toppings and.
best of all," he added, "they'll be
cheap."
The main problem for the Italian
House is that the kitchen oven cannot
go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which
is not hot enough to make good pizza,
according to Cobb. So with the help of
three other Italian House residents,
Hall Kent, Mark Nassutti and Joe Wu,
Cobb formed a group to attack the
problem.
Project approved
The house residents approved the
project as a good means of making
house goals known on campus. Asst.
Row Office Director Tom Hornbeak

also gave his approval to the project.
According to Cobb, the next step
was to approach University Food Ser
vice Manager Maxine Anderson. Not
only does the Food Service have ulti
mate control over the kitchen in the
Italian House, but Anderson also per
sonally designed that particular
kitchen.
At first she was quite concerned
about the effects of the project on the
kitchen, Cobb said, but "ultimately she
offered to help us acquire an oven."
Thebiggest obstacle, however, was a
University energy moratorium on new
energy-consuming devices on cam

pus, Cobb said.
"We had to convince the University
Housing Office that the oven wouldn't
use that much energy and that we
could compensate for the energy used
by putting butterfly valves on the nor
mal gas oven to cut down on the gas
used."
Director of University Housing Fd
ward Scoles said, "When I first heard
the idea I was concerned about what
seemed to be a new energy-user, but as
I understand it, it would mean a net
gain because the pizza oven would re
quire less energy than the normal
oven."

Scoles said he would not have ap
proved the project if it had needed
University funding. Cobb said the
group is trying to raise enough money
from students in the house and com
munity supporters of the house. They
are also applying for the Pierce Memo
rial Award which annually gives $750
to a student project which will benefit
the community.
"They're doing a very good job of
investigating all angles of this pro
ject," said Scoles.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Norman Robinson has also given
his approval to the project.
