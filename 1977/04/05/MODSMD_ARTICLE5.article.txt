# Zaire alleges invasion, breaks Cuban relations

Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) — The Zaire government broke relations with Cuba
yesterday, alleging it had uncovered evidence that Cuba was involved in the
invasion of copper-rich Shaba Province by Angola-based rebels.
The government radio announced the break and claimed that documents
proving Cuban involvement were found on an unidentified Cuban diplomat.
The radio gave no details of the document.
The broadcast said all Cuban diplomats were ordered to leave the country "in
accordance with international usage." There was no indication how many
Cuban diplomats are in /aire.
President Mobutu Sese Seko's government has repeatedly claimed that Cuba,
as well as the Soviet Union and Angola, are backing the invaders in Shaba with
military advisers, troops, arms and equipment.
The Cubans, Russians and Angolans have denied any role in the invasion.
Cuban President Fidel Castro told a press conference inTanzania last month that
Mobutu's accusations were an "excuse for getting more military aid from the
Yankee imperialists and European neocolonialists."
Last week Zaire army commanders told newsmen their troops have found
Russians, Cubans and Portuguese among dead enemy soldiers. But they offered
no evidence to back the claim. The Portuguese are former colonial rulers of
Angola.
As many as 15,000 Soviet-backed Cuban troops fought in the Angolan civil
war to help the Marxist-oriented Popular Movement beat out two pro-Western
nationalist factions, and thousands of Cuban troops are reported still in Angola.
In other developments:
—Diplomatic sources said Mobutu has replaced the popular army chief of
staff, Cen. Bumba Moasso, with 31-year-old Cen. Babia Zingbi Malobia, a
Belgian-trained officer and director-general of Zaire's Defense Ministry for the
past year.
