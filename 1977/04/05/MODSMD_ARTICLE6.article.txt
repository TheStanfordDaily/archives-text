### Debbie Gong-Guy

Five slates were originally filed, but
the Craig Kensek slate withdrew from
the race last night at 9:20 p.m.
Kensek explained that one of the
members withdrew for personal
reasons and because the members of
the slate felt that it would be too dif

Danner, "year as yet undetermined,
major in Zulu cooking, has some pre

perience."

member of the Chaparral, is leading a
slate composed of junior Leslie Brettell,

working for a master's in industrial
engineering.
