# Lyman supports tenure report
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman said last
night that he plans to publicly support
the ASSU Task Force Report on Te
nure and Teaching Ouality when it
comes before the Faculty Senate this
quarter.
Speaking at a forum on tenure spon
sored by Students Interested in Te
nure, Lyman said he supports the task
force report, but not without reserva
tion.
Lyman said he thought the task force
was "shrewd in insisting on effective
student evaluations" to gain student

input into tenure decisions. He added
that students on promotion commit
tees suffer from lack of experience and
are constantly trying to "catch up."
They often resort to co-option — "me
tooing" — or confrontation that leads
to much "sound and fury," he said.
William Kays, dean of the School of
Engineering, and Harry Harding, as
sistant professor of political science,
also spoke at the forum.
Boycott
The way students can influence the
quality of their education is to
"boycott bad teaching and overwhelm
good teaching," said Kays.
"You waste your time trying to di
rectly influence tenure decisions. The
role of students is that of informed and
discriminating consumers. Students
do know good teaching when they see
it,"he said.
Harding said that in order to im
prove undergraduate education, the
faculty will be asked to devote more
time to preparation of classes. He
suggested that the extra time should
come from providing more leaves of
absence, expecting less research or re
ducing the course loads of professors.
Promotions
Lyman said that he thought teaching
should not be overly weighted in the
promotions process. "C.ood teaching
alone is not a sufficient basis for prom
otion," he said. "Many provocative
young teachers become the dead

wood, the exploded volcanoes of later
years."
Lyman also said that "research is a
more solid basis for promotion than
student popularity, and is not as dif
ficult to evaluate as teaching quality."
Harding discussed three myths
about the relationship between tenure
and teaching quality that he said he
thinks only confuse the issue.
The first myth is that a university
need not really be concerned with
good teaching and that students at a
university should seek learning and
should not be spoon-fed. Harding said
this myth should be replaced with the
notion that students should be encour
aged to learn and should be taught
both at colleges as well as universities.
The second myth implies that what
appears to be good teaching is actually
bad teaching. The rationale would be
that no one who can be a good teacher
can be keeping up in the field. Harding
disagreed, saying that a performer who
is not up-to-date is a bad teacher.
The third myth is that what appears
to be bad teaching is good teaching.
This is an unconvincing rationale for
mediocrity, according to Harding. The
theory is that learning can best take
place through student discussion
monitored by an unprepared profes
sor. Instead, said Harding, a professor
who is a brilliant researcher but lacks
pedagogic skills or is not prepared is a
bad teacher.

about the relationship between tenure
and teaching quality that he said he
thinks only confuse the issue.
The first myth is that a university
need not really be concerned with
good teaching and that students at a
university should seek learning and
should not be spoon-fed. Harding said
this myth should be replaced with the
notion that students should be encour
aged to learn and should be taught
both at colleges as well as universities.
The second myth implies that what
appears to be good teaching is actually
bad teaching. The rationale would be
that no one who can be a good teacher
can be keeping up in the field. Harding
disagreed, saying that a performer who
is not up-to-date is a bad teacher.
The third myth is that what appears
to be bad teaching is good teaching.
This is an unconvincing rationale for
mediocrity, according to Harding. The
theory is that learning can best take
place through student discussion
monitored by an unprepared profes
sor. Instead, said Harding, a professor
who is a brilliant researcher but lacks
pedagogic skills or is not prepared is a
bad teacher.
President Richard Lyman said last
night that he plans to publicly support
the ASSU Task Force Report on Te
nure and Teaching Ouality when it
comes before the Faculty Senate this
quarter.
Speaking at a forum on tenure spon
sored by Students Interested in Te
nure, Lyman said he supports the task
force report, but not without reserva
tion.
Lyman said he thought the task force
was "shrewd in insisting on effective
student evaluations" to gain student

input into tenure decisions. He added
that students on promotion commit
tees suffer from lack of experience and
are constantly trying to "catch up."
They often resort to co-option — "me
tooing" — or confrontation that leads
to much "sound and fury," he said.
William Kays, dean of the School of
Engineering, and Harry Harding, as
sistant professor of political science,
also spoke at the forum.
Boycott
The way students can influence the
quality of their education is to
"boycott bad teaching and overwhelm
good teaching," said Kays.
"You waste your time trying to di
rectly influence tenure decisions. The
role of students is that of informed and
discriminating consumers. Students
do know good teaching when they see
it,"he said.
Harding said that in order to im
prove undergraduate education, the
faculty will be asked to devote more
time to preparation of classes. He
suggested that the extra time should
come from providing more leaves of
absence, expecting less research or re
ducing the course loads of professors.
Promotions
Lyman said that he thought teaching
should not be overly weighted in the
promotions process. "C.ood teaching
alone is not a sufficient basis for prom
otion," he said. "Many provocative
young teachers become the dead

wood, the exploded volcanoes of later
years."
Lyman also said that "research is a
more solid basis for promotion than
student popularity, and is not as dif
ficult to evaluate as teaching quality."
Harding discussed three myths
about the relationship between tenure
and teaching quality that he said he
