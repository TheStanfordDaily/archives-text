## Energy selflessness needed 
### 
David Sartoris

The California water shortage and
the nationwide energy crisis are hut
two of the numerous indicators that
our era of selfishness with nature is
nearing its end. Although it has long
been recognized that the supply of
natural resources is not unlimited,
government control of wasteful
exploitation on.the part of individuals
and industry is characteristically in
adequate.
Laws regulating industry are often
slow in passage and lacking in en
forcement, while individual restraint
typically operates via economic incen
tives which fail to solve the problem.
President Carter's recently proposed
bill concerning new car sales is clearly
no exception. Its provisions include a
tax on the purchase of low-mileage,
gas-eating automobiles, as well as re
bates to sensible consumers buying
more economical, high-mileage cars.
While certainly a positive step to
ward more prudent use of remaining
resources, the [dan suffers in that it
fails to affect those most guilty of
wastefulness. This inadequacy is
characteristic of nearly all money
based incentives for conservation, and
demonstrates the need for more deci
sive governmental action in environ

mental affairs.
Upon careful s( rutiny, it becomes
clear that President Carter's proposal
does little that the large fuel price in
creases of the early 1970s failed to do.
The well-off individuals in this coun
try who can presently afford to operate
large, low-mileage automobiles are
hardly likely to flinch over a tax which
might just as easily have been an in
crease in the manufacturer's selling
price.
In contrast, those who might re
spond favorably to the plan are proba
bly already driving the kinds of cars
which should have been introduced 20
years ago.
The Carter plan is also deficient in
that it fails to influence current owners
of existing wasteful automobiles, deal
ing exclusively with our new car sales.
As a result, even if effective in
eliminating the purchase of low
mileage vehicles, its major impact
would come slowly over the course of
years.
Unfortunately, as we are grimly
coming to realize. Mother Nature is not
willing to wait for man's dawdling
with regard to resource conservation.
It is thus imperative that the new
administration, as well as American

government in general, take a more
decisive stand in the crucial area ot
environmental preservation. An im
mediate ban on the manufacture of
low-mileage automobiles, rather than
the current proposal, is more like the
kind of legislation which is presently
essential.
While likely to be unpopular with
those immunized to the problem by
wealth, continuing absence of power
ful regulation will soon find us all on
bicycles.
It is invaluable to consider the situa
tion our country might currently find
itself in had such an attitude been
adopted years ago. Lower fuel prices,
decreased dependence on foreign
sources of energy, and perhaps more
effective mass transportation would
have resulted from better foresight and
planning for the future.
Instead, we find ourselves expend
ing more energy to get more energy,
through such environmentally
destructive endeavors as strip mining
and the Alaska pipeline. Let us learn
from our numerous mistakes of the
past and salvage what remains in a
more intelligent and decisive manner.

the nationwide energy crisis are hut
two of the numerous indicators that
our era of selfishness with nature is
nearing its end. Although it has long
been recognized that the supply of
natural resources is not unlimited,
government control of wasteful
exploitation on.the part of individuals
and industry is characteristically in
adequate.
Laws regulating industry are often
slow in passage and lacking in en
forcement, while individual restraint
typically operates via economic incen
tives which fail to solve the problem.
President Carter's recently proposed
bill concerning new car sales is clearly
no exception. Its provisions include a
tax on the purchase of low-mileage,
gas-eating automobiles, as well as re
bates to sensible consumers buying
more economical, high-mileage cars.
While certainly a positive step to
ward more prudent use of remaining
resources, the [dan suffers in that it
fails to affect those most guilty of
wastefulness. This inadequacy is
characteristic of nearly all money
based incentives for conservation, and
demonstrates the need for more deci
sive governmental action in environ

mental affairs.
Upon careful s( rutiny, it becomes
clear that President Carter's proposal
does little that the large fuel price in
creases of the early 1970s failed to do.
The well-off individuals in this coun
try who can presently afford to operate
large, low-mileage automobiles are
hardly likely to flinch over a tax which
might just as easily have been an in
crease in the manufacturer's selling
price.
In contrast, those who might re
spond favorably to the plan are proba
bly already driving the kinds of cars
which should have been introduced 20
years ago.
The Carter plan is also deficient in
that it fails to influence current owners
of existing wasteful automobiles, deal
ing exclusively with our new car sales.
As a result, even if effective in
eliminating the purchase of low
mileage vehicles, its major impact
would come slowly over the course of
years.
Unfortunately, as we are grimly
coming to realize. Mother Nature is not
willing to wait for man's dawdling
with regard to resource conservation.
It is thus imperative that the new
administration, as well as American

government in general, take a more
decisive stand in the crucial area ot
environmental preservation. An im
mediate ban on the manufacture of
low-mileage automobiles, rather than
the current proposal, is more like the
kind of legislation which is presently
essential.
While likely to be unpopular with
those immunized to the problem by
wealth, continuing absence of power
ful regulation will soon find us all on
bicycles.
It is invaluable to consider the situa
tion our country might currently find
itself in had such an attitude been
adopted years ago. Lower fuel prices,
decreased dependence on foreign
sources of energy, and perhaps more
effective mass transportation would
have resulted from better foresight and
planning for the future.
Instead, we find ourselves expend
ing more energy to get more energy,
through such environmentally
destructive endeavors as strip mining
and the Alaska pipeline. Let us learn
from our numerous mistakes of the
past and salvage what remains in a
more intelligent and decisive manner.
