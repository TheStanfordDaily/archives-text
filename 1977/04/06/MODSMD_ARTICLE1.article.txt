# Grad job prospects brighten
## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
Job-harried 1977 graduates may be
happy to learn that prospects for
employment after graduation should
be better than ever.
The best prediction for this year's
prospective job market can be gleaned
from what happened last year, accord
ing to Ralph Keller, director of the
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC).
Last year, the employment rate for
Stanford graduates increased by 11.3
per cent over the previous year, ac
cording to theCPPC's annual report for
1975-76.
The report also indicated that stu
dents generally had little difficulty in
finding employment, although some
did not find jobs immediately after
graduation.
Although employment rates among
Stanford graduates have continued to
increase over the last 10 years, Keller
warned that the employment rate
"cannot continue to improve, since
that's statistically impossible. The
percentages will eventually plateau."
Problem
The ever-present problem, said Kel
ler, is the great increase in the number
of graduates seeking employment rela
tive to the number of jobs available.
The number of graduates nowadays
is five times that of 1940, Keller said,
but the number of jobs suitable for stu
dents with B.A. degrees has increased
only 13 per cent.
According to Keller, a similar trend
holds true for students receiving
graduate degrees. In 1962, approxi
mately 11,000 students received a
Ph.D. degree. Over 35,000 students re
ceived Ph.D.s in 1975.
Although there are more jobs availa
ble todav than ever before, said Keller,

there are also significantly more
people in the labor force than at any
other time in the nation's history.
"Unemployment is not a problem of
economic conditions as government
officials tend to think," said Keller.
"It's a problem related to our present
labor force."
Any problem Stanford graduates
will face in the job market cannot be
attributed to the students themselves,
said Keller.
Labor conditions
"Any lack of success in the job mar
ket for Stanford grads is not related to
their ability to successfully perform —
it is related only to the conditions of
the labor force," added Keller.
Because approximately 80 per cent
of jobs open are in the general area of
business and industry, students con
centrated in these fields will of course
probably find work more easily.
Although job placement statistics
for Stanford liberal arts graduates im
proved by about one per cent in 1975-
76 over the previous year, conditions
in the job market have been and will be
toughest for the liberal arts graduate,
according to Keller.
Difficulties facing liberal arts and
humanities majors might be seen as
pointing to a need for greater speciali
zation than a broad liberal education
affords.
However, Keller said the problem
"is that students' educational prog
rams are possibly not diversified
enough."
Diversity
Keller said the CPPC advises stu
dents "that the best education is gen
eral and diversified. In addition to a
liberal arts program, economics, math
and other practicum courses should be
included by necessity."

According to the CPPC annual re
port 1975-76, college degree holders at
all levels must be prepared to adjust to
work situations foreign to the
specialized area of their preparation.
The evidence thus far seems to indi
cate that the University should be
moving in the direction of more di
verse and generalized undergraduate
programs at a time when it appears to
be moving in the opposite direction,
toward increasing degrees of educa
tional specialization, the CPPC report
stated.
"Relative to prospects for students
out of other universities," said Keller,
"job prospects for Stanford grads has
been, is, and will be good, given some
diversity in their programs."

be moving in the opposite direction,
toward increasing degrees of educa
tional specialization, the CPPC report
stated.
"Relative to prospects for students
out of other universities," said Keller,
"job prospects for Stanford grads has
been, is, and will be good, given some
diversity in their programs."

Job-harried 1977 graduates may be
happy to learn that prospects for
employment after graduation should
be better than ever.
The best prediction for this year's
prospective job market can be gleaned
from what happened last year, accord
ing to Ralph Keller, director of the
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC).
Last year, the employment rate for
Stanford graduates increased by 11.3
per cent over the previous year, ac
cording to theCPPC's annual report for
1975-76.
The report also indicated that stu
dents generally had little difficulty in
finding employment, although some
did not find jobs immediately after
graduation.
Although employment rates among
Stanford graduates have continued to
increase over the last 10 years, Keller
warned that the employment rate
"cannot continue to improve, since
that's statistically impossible. The
percentages will eventually plateau."
Problem
The ever-present problem, said Kel
ler, is the great increase in the number
of graduates seeking employment rela
tive to the number of jobs available.
The number of graduates nowadays
is five times that of 1940, Keller said,
but the number of jobs suitable for stu
dents with B.A. degrees has increased
only 13 per cent.
According to Keller, a similar trend
holds true for students receiving
graduate degrees. In 1962, approxi
mately 11,000 students received a
Ph.D. degree. Over 35,000 students re
ceived Ph.D.s in 1975.
Although there are more jobs availa
ble todav than ever before, said Keller,

there are also significantly more
people in the labor force than at any
other time in the nation's history.
"Unemployment is not a problem of
economic conditions as government
officials tend to think," said Keller.
"It's a problem related to our present
labor force."
Any problem Stanford graduates
will face in the job market cannot be
attributed to the students themselves,
said Keller.
Labor conditions
"Any lack of success in the job mar
ket for Stanford grads is not related to
their ability to successfully perform —
it is related only to the conditions of
the labor force," added Keller.
Because approximately 80 per cent
of jobs open are in the general area of
business and industry, students con
centrated in these fields will of course
probably find work more easily.
Although job placement statistics
for Stanford liberal arts graduates im
proved by about one per cent in 1975-
76 over the previous year, conditions
in the job market have been and will be
toughest for the liberal arts graduate,
according to Keller.
Difficulties facing liberal arts and
humanities majors might be seen as
pointing to a need for greater speciali
zation than a broad liberal education
affords.
However, Keller said the problem
"is that students' educational prog
rams are possibly not diversified
enough."
Diversity
Keller said the CPPC advises stu
dents "that the best education is gen
eral and diversified. In addition to a
liberal arts program, economics, math
and other practicum courses should be
included by necessity."

According to the CPPC annual re
port 1975-76, college degree holders at
all levels must be prepared to adjust to
work situations foreign to the
specialized area of their preparation.
The evidence thus far seems to indi
cate that the University should be
moving in the direction of more di
verse and generalized undergraduate
programs at a time when it appears to
be moving in the opposite direction,
toward increasing degrees of educa
tional specialization, the CPPC report
stated.
"Relative to prospects for students
out of other universities," said Keller,
"job prospects for Stanford grads has
