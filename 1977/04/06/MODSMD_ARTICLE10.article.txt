If the ASSLJ is a joke, it's an awfully
expensive one — over $2 million pas
ses through our student government
each year. The ASSLJ is also responsi
ble for appointing those students who
represent your interests on committees
of the Board of Trustees and the faculty
senate.
Furthermore, ASSLJ projects like the
Sunday Flicks, lecture notes and spe
cial events provide many services to
students. Another project, the ASSU
Course Guide, has frequently been cal
led upon to provide evaluative infor
mation for tenure decisions. The
ASSU is not a joke — we urge you to
vo'e.
Uecent COP elections have been
characterized by slates representing
either "activist" or "service" con
cerns. We see no need to be bound by
this restricting tradition. Because of
our diverse background, we can most
capably represent all student con
cerns. We are not the radical slate, and
we are not the moderate or conserva
tive slate — such labels are meaning
less at this level of politics. We will be
advocates and activists for student
concerns, yet still be able to provide
students the services they desire. By
being a council of co-presidents, the
Jordan-1. arson-Henkels-Westly slate
can best represent all students.
There are three reasons why the Jor

dan slate stands out in this COP elec
tion. First, we can bring a genuine
commitment to the issues. Only a
graduate student, for example, can
deal with the problems that graduate
students face. Yet we are the only slate
which has a graduate student on it.
Similarly, the Jordan slate will better
represent minorities, women, and spe
cial interests such as fraternities and
club sports.
Second, we anticipate being effec
tive as COP because of our experience.
We bring with us a body of knowledge
derived from past involvement, as well
as experience with a variety of
technique for influencing decisions in
the University — ranging from service
on a University committee to organiz
ing a White Plaza rally and march.
Finally and most importantly, we
will be successful as COP because we
are goal-oriented. We are not in
terested in being the COP. but in serv
ing as the COP.
Our goals as COP are spelled out
quite specifically in our platform
which we urge all of you to read. In
deed, it is absurd to attempt any all
encompassing statement concerning
our stands on the issues in this brief
space. But we do hope the following
list of "promises" will serve as an in
dication of what we will do for you
upon election.

1. We will keep the COP office open
40 hours a week, insuring all students
an opportunity to reach us;
2. We will sponsor a campus-wide
event, most likely a White Plaza dance,
by the end of spring quarter;
3. We will lobby for special interests
such as club sports, women and
minorities, as well as fraternities.
4. We will prepare and publish re
ports on the following: students' needs
and wants concerning advising. Uni
versity budget priorities as they affect
the Overseas Studies Program, the role
of women at Stanford, undergraduate
minority admissions, and the estab
lishment of a Teaching Resource
Center.
5. We will estatyish departmental
associations where they don't pre
sently exist;
6. We will establish student intern
ships with University administrators;
7. We will not neglect issues con
cerning graduate students. To forget
the needs of 45 per cent of the student
body would be the worst form of mis
representation.

graduate student, for example, can
deal with the problems that graduate
students face. Yet we are the only slate
which has a graduate student on it.
Similarly, the Jordan slate will better
represent minorities, women, and spe
cial interests such as fraternities and
club sports.
Second, we anticipate being effec
tive as COP because of our experience.
We bring with us a body of knowledge
derived from past involvement, as well
as experience with a variety of
technique for influencing decisions in
the University — ranging from service
on a University committee to organiz
ing a White Plaza rally and march.
Finally and most importantly, we
will be successful as COP because we
are goal-oriented. We are not in
terested in being the COP. but in serv
ing as the COP.
Our goals as COP are spelled out
quite specifically in our platform
which we urge all of you to read. In
deed, it is absurd to attempt any all
encompassing statement concerning
our stands on the issues in this brief
space. But we do hope the following
list of "promises" will serve as an in
dication of what we will do for you
upon election.

1. We will keep the COP office open
40 hours a week, insuring all students
an opportunity to reach us;
2. We will sponsor a campus-wide
event, most likely a White Plaza dance,
by the end of spring quarter;
3. We will lobby for special interests
such as club sports, women and
minorities, as well as fraternities.
4. We will prepare and publish re
ports on the following: students' needs
and wants concerning advising. Uni
versity budget priorities as they affect
the Overseas Studies Program, the role
of women at Stanford, undergraduate
minority admissions, and the estab
lishment of a Teaching Resource
Center.
5. We will estatyish departmental
associations where they don't pre
sently exist;
6. We will establish student intern
ships with University administrators;
7. We will not neglect issues con
cerning graduate students. To forget
the needs of 45 per cent of the student
body would be the worst form of mis
representation.

If the ASSLJ is a joke, it's an awfully
expensive one — over $2 million pas
ses through our student government
each year. The ASSLJ is also responsi
ble for appointing those students who
represent your interests on committees
of the Board of Trustees and the faculty
senate.
Furthermore, ASSLJ projects like the
Sunday Flicks, lecture notes and spe
cial events provide many services to
students. Another project, the ASSU
Course Guide, has frequently been cal
led upon to provide evaluative infor
mation for tenure decisions. The
ASSU is not a joke — we urge you to
vo'e.
Uecent COP elections have been
characterized by slates representing
either "activist" or "service" con
cerns. We see no need to be bound by
this restricting tradition. Because of
our diverse background, we can most
capably represent all student con
cerns. We are not the radical slate, and
we are not the moderate or conserva
tive slate — such labels are meaning
less at this level of politics. We will be
advocates and activists for student
concerns, yet still be able to provide
students the services they desire. By
being a council of co-presidents, the
Jordan-1. arson-Henkels-Westly slate
can best represent all students.
There are three reasons why the Jor

dan slate stands out in this COP elec
tion. First, we can bring a genuine
commitment to the issues. Only a
graduate student, for example, can
deal with the problems that graduate
students face. Yet we are the only slate
which has a graduate student on it.
