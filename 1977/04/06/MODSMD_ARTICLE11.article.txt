# Answering destiny

Alben et al

The Heffalump and Woozle slate is
running for a purpose — Flipper. But
seriously, friends, we can offer you no
thing but blood, toil, tears and sweat.
Time is of the essence, the hour is upon
us, our destiny calls; in short, the shit
has hit the fan!
We'd like to take this opportunity to
dispel a few of the vicious rumors,
slanderous lies, libelous invectives
and dirty fibs, which our mindless ri
vals, our clone-brained opposition,
our lobotomized combatants, in sum,
the ninnies who feebly seek to prevent
our imminent election, have perpet
rated.
To prove this, let facts be submitted
to a candid world:
1. We do not advocate forced steril i

zation of people from Idaho. The slate
has debated this burning issue over the
last few weeks and by majority vote
arrived at this visionary policy, revers
ing our previous decision.
2. We do not favor the adoption of
the fetal pig as the Stanford mascot-.
3. We do not support annexation of
the Sudetenland. We've been deadset
against it from the start.
4. We simply cannot uphold the in
stitution of capital punishment for
honor code violations. Tar and feath
ers will suffice as a deterrent.
Now let's look at the record. Take
our opponents — please. As for ourse
lves, we of the Heffalump and Woozle
slate stand for the national anthem.
However, what of the pressing con
troversies not addressed by our oppos

ition? Well, what of them? Heffalump
and Woozle is not afraid to put its
views on the line:
Detente — takfe it with a grain of
SALT.
Incest — it's all relative.
Abortion — out with it.
The Middle East — why certainly.
Integration — we're indifferential
on this one.
In conclusion, should such factors
as leadership, previous' experience,
administrative ability, and dedication
enter into your decision on April 13
and 14? We think not. Borrow your
roommate's I.D. and vote twice for Hef
falump and Wozzle. You'll be sorry
you did.
