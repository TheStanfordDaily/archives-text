Docters et al

Speaking for Peter Hausknecht, Les
lie Brettel 1, Larry Berz and myself
(Robert Docters) I would like to com
municate two points central to this
slate's campaign, and make an obser
vation.
My observation is essentially this.
Every year, including this one, a
number of COP slates present them
selves as dynamic, fresh, and about to
boldly sweep away the evils of the past
COP. No council that I am aware of has
when elected brought about the prom
ised enlightenment. 1 suspect this is
for two reasons.
The first is that no matter how broad
the candidate's experience in the se
nate, there is a new perspective once in
office. 1 suggest that a new perspective
is understandable and realistic.
The second reason for a post
election change in attitude is that on
closer inspection it frequently seems
that the past COP actually did a better
job than many people had imagined.
Specifically the present COP of Petroff
et al., while roundly criticized, has
nonetheless accomplished some very
positive things which we intend to
carry further. •
For example over last summer and
spring they formed the ASSU tenure
and teaching task force whose propos
als will shortly be voted on by the Fa
culty Senate.
This is not to say that we have no
criticisms of the past COP, quite the
contrary, we think that Petroff's man
ner of vetoing the proposal to make
COP salaries subject to fee assessment
was genuinely arrogant. There are ar
guments in favor of that decision, but
the execution of the veto certainly did
not raise the level of cooperation bet
ween the COP and senate. I argue that
it is essential to have an internally
cooperative ASSU if it is to deal effec
tively with the administration and Fa
culty Senate.
The two centerpieces of this slate's
campaign are as follows: money and
effective cooperation.
Candidates have chosen University
and ASSU finances as an issue innum
erable times before. Some actually
made constructive changes in this
area, others did not. We will fight to.
Money does not seem to be a major
issue of the '77 COP race. However, it
is the most central subject to anyone

who pays tuition or the hidden ASSU
fees at this university. Put briefly, this
slate will focus on two points in Uni
versity finances.
• 1. During our tenure in office we
would resume the pressure on the ad
ministration to run a more stream
lined, cost-effective operation. This
pressure has been relaxed while it is
clearly needed. We are the most suita
ble slate to make the correct proposals
to slow costs immediately.
2. The internal workings of the
ASSU need overhaul. Although the
fees you pay for running the ASSU are
somewhat hidden (e.g. the fee the
ASSU takes out of dorm bills) you pay
them nonetheless. We are the only
slate which will energetically work to
save you money in this regard.
The second central problem we will
pursue is the internal cooperation of
the ASSU. Without reciting cliches
about houses divided, the fact remains
that the students were deprived of an
effective voice by the destructive
intra-organizational squabbles of this

year. We promise you the time, flexi
bility, and above all diplomacy to pre
vent a repetition of the worst debacles.
Peter Hausknecht is a coterminal
student seeking his master's in indust
rial engineering. He is currently pres
ident of ATO House, active in the
Sierra Club, and a manic philatelist.
Leslie Brettell is a junior majoring in
human biology. She does research in
cell mobility over in the Medical
Center, and lives in Roble.
Larry Berz is a junior majoring in
history. He is a trendy radical who,
when asked, described himself as . .
a free spirit. Turned off by conven
tional student politics, I seek to alter
student consciousness to higher
goals. . He then smiled broadly.
I (Robert Docters) am a philosophy
major, and a libertarian (which is less
central than it might be, as the ASSU is
a corporation, rather than a govern
ment). All whimsy aside, I ask your
vote both for what we might do for you,
and as an endorsement for some of the
things we have said.

effective cooperation.
Candidates have chosen University
and ASSU finances as an issue innum
erable times before. Some actually
made constructive changes in this
area, others did not. We will fight to.
Money does not seem to be a major
issue of the '77 COP race. However, it
is the most central subject to anyone

who pays tuition or the hidden ASSU
fees at this university. Put briefly, this
slate will focus on two points in Uni
versity finances.
• 1. During our tenure in office we
would resume the pressure on the ad
ministration to run a more stream
lined, cost-effective operation. This
pressure has been relaxed while it is
clearly needed. We are the most suita
ble slate to make the correct proposals
to slow costs immediately.
2. The internal workings of the
ASSU need overhaul. Although the
fees you pay for running the ASSU are
somewhat hidden (e.g. the fee the
ASSU takes out of dorm bills) you pay
them nonetheless. We are the only
slate which will energetically work to
save you money in this regard.
The second central problem we will
pursue is the internal cooperation of
the ASSU. Without reciting cliches
about houses divided, the fact remains
that the students were deprived of an
effective voice by the destructive
intra-organizational squabbles of this

year. We promise you the time, flexi
bility, and above all diplomacy to pre
vent a repetition of the worst debacles.
Peter Hausknecht is a coterminal
student seeking his master's in indust
rial engineering. He is currently pres
ident of ATO House, active in the
Sierra Club, and a manic philatelist.
Leslie Brettell is a junior majoring in
human biology. She does research in
cell mobility over in the Medical
Center, and lives in Roble.
Larry Berz is a junior majoring in
history. He is a trendy radical who,
when asked, described himself as . .
a free spirit. Turned off by conven
tional student politics, I seek to alter
student consciousness to higher
goals. . He then smiled broadly.
I (Robert Docters) am a philosophy
major, and a libertarian (which is less
central than it might be, as the ASSU is
a corporation, rather than a govern
ment). All whimsy aside, I ask your
vote both for what we might do for you,
and as an endorsement for some of the
things we have said.
Docters et al

Speaking for Peter Hausknecht, Les
lie Brettel 1, Larry Berz and myself
(Robert Docters) I would like to com
municate two points central to this
slate's campaign, and make an obser
vation.
My observation is essentially this.
Every year, including this one, a
number of COP slates present them
selves as dynamic, fresh, and about to
boldly sweep away the evils of the past
COP. No council that I am aware of has
when elected brought about the prom
ised enlightenment. 1 suspect this is
for two reasons.
The first is that no matter how broad
the candidate's experience in the se
nate, there is a new perspective once in
office. 1 suggest that a new perspective
is understandable and realistic.
The second reason for a post
election change in attitude is that on
closer inspection it frequently seems
that the past COP actually did a better
job than many people had imagined.
Specifically the present COP of Petroff
et al., while roundly criticized, has
nonetheless accomplished some very
positive things which we intend to
carry further. •
For example over last summer and
spring they formed the ASSU tenure
and teaching task force whose propos
als will shortly be voted on by the Fa
culty Senate.
This is not to say that we have no
criticisms of the past COP, quite the
contrary, we think that Petroff's man
ner of vetoing the proposal to make
COP salaries subject to fee assessment
was genuinely arrogant. There are ar
guments in favor of that decision, but
the execution of the veto certainly did
not raise the level of cooperation bet
ween the COP and senate. I argue that
it is essential to have an internally
cooperative ASSU if it is to deal effec
tively with the administration and Fa
culty Senate.
The two centerpieces of this slate's
campaign are as follows: money and
effective cooperation.
