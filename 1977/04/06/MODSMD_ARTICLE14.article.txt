## Opinions Chace's letter 'elitist' 
### 
Don Moonshine

Assoc. English Prof. William Chace's
letter (Daily, March 30) in response to
our article (Daily, March 28) exhibits
exactly the kind of uncritical (and con
sequently elitist) consciousness which
we were attacking in the first place.
Chace responds to our "old and cor
rupt" argument that " . .the admis
sions office at Stanford is committed to
perpetuating the elite structure of soc
iety. . .' " with an answer that is
perhaps older and certainly more cor
rupt: that Stanford is a university
committed to intellectual excellence
and its admissions policy and practice
is directed towards that commitment
without regard to race, creed, color.
A critical look at this argument,
which in its abstract form looks per
fectly acceptable to everyone, reveals
the subtle elitism on which it is built.
Cultural screen
The criteria of this "intellectual ex
cellence" to which Stanford is com

mitted acts as a cultural screen to in
sure a disproportionately large percen
tage of white middle class students.
The heavy reliance on verbal ability
and standardized test scores as criteria
for admissions is necessary to provide
the highly educated work force de
manded by a technologically sophisti
cated capitalist economy, and guaran
tees the perpetuation of the ethnic and
class composition of the ruling class
since white middle class people by
and large are the only people capable
of fulfilling the criteria of "intellectual
excellence" as that phrase is under
stood at this institution.
Stanford is committed to "intellec
tual excellence," but intellectual ex
cellence is a concept that cannot be
defined apart from Stanford's role as a
leading institution in capitalist soci
ety; i.e., Stanford exists to provide the
necessary intellectual manpower for
the perpetuation of oppressive institu
tions.
Ivory tower
Any attempts to refute this by asser
tions of Stanford's ivory tower inde
pendence from economic society must
be made in the face of Stanford's role in
the development of the political
economy of the Santa Clara Valley
(especially the electronics industry,
heavily dependent on defense con
tracts and resulting in huge profits for
owners and economic oppression for
workers, mostly Third World and
female workers); SRl's role in main
taining and extending U.S. im
perialism (until SRI was forced out of
the University by student agitation);
the Hoover Institute's role in support
ing anti-communist goverment activ
ity; and a host of other activities which

reveal Stanford's intimate connections
with the prevailing capitalist elites.
In concrete form, what Chace's at
titude comes down to is that (al
legedly) non-discriminatory tests are
applied by (allegedly) non
discriminatory means so that when a
discriminatory result occurs the Uni
versity can hold out its clean hands
and say, "See, it's not my fault."
Equally applied
The admissions criteria are applied
equally to everyone no matter what
their ethnic or economic background.
That this results in a deficiency of
minority and poor people is sad, but of
no ethnical consequence because the
process was "fair."
The self-help requirement exists for
all students and, by definition, all poor
students are on financial aid, these
students are forced to take time off
from their studies to support them
selves in a manner that wealthy (and
mostly white) students are not, thus
further handicapping these students
in achieving the goal of "intellectual
excellence" from which she or he
probably started out at a disadvantage.
Again, since the self-help requirement
is applied non-discriminatorily, Stan
ford feels it has fulfilled its duties to
society.
Whatever may be the good inten
tions of Chace or the admis
sions office, an uncritical acceptance
of Stanford's current role in society
and the concrete manifestations of that
role, including its commitment to "in
tellectual excellence," necessarily re
sults in a racist, sexist, and elitist con
sciousness.
