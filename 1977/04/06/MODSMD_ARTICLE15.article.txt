'-tent developments in the Bakke
case have lead us to state our opinion.
j e ee ' '' la t its confirmation poses a
great threat to affirmative action prog
rams, which are a medium to correct
cuirent social injustices. We disagree
v \itn those who believe that without
t iem minority recruitment would
have occurred or will continue. In fact,
the drop in minority graduate enroll
ment in the past two years, across the
country and here points otherwise.
On Tuesday, Feb. 22, the U.S.
Supreme Court decided to accept the
case and according to james Bell, Head
Hastings Black Law Students As
sociation, it will take around five
months for the court to reach a deci
sion.
Across the state and across the coun
try major opposition to the ruling of
so-called reverse racism and support
fur minority recruitment programs is
growing. The National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) and the Mexican-American
Legal Defense Fund (MALDF) expres
sed their opposition immediately after
the California Supreme Court ruling
and asked the UC Regents not to ap
peal to the U.S. Supreme Court, fearing
the demise of affirmative action prog
rams and criticizing the initial weak
defense presented by the UC lawyers.
Nevertheless, it was appealed. Since
then, national civil rights and labor
groups asked the U.S. Supreme Court
not to hear the case. David Saxon, pres
ident of the UC system, has criticized
the decision and restated his support
for minority recruitment programs. So
has Harvard's Derek Bok.
And recently, President Richard
Lyman disclosed Stanford's possible
filing of an amicus brief. We want to
add our name to the growing list.
Our concern lies in our basic belief
in social justice and the effect affir
mative action programs have had on
our Spanish Department, like those ac
ross the state and the nation. Chicanos,
a designated minority, have readily
used our language and literature
courses to rebuild their Spanish and
enrich their culture. (Indirectly, this
phenomenon has benefited English

speakers in learning Spanish.)
For the first time in this country's
history, the language needs of our sec
ond major language are being met, at
least marginally. The impact has been
felt across the board.
Logically, we know that this would
not hdve occurred without affirmative
action programs. Their possible de
mise threatens this development and a
repression of a minority's educational
and cultural rights.
In publishing our opinion, we wish
to dismiss the false notion that
minorities have made it. On such false
notion is based "reverse racism." In
terms of chicanos, they constitute IB
per cent of California's population,
yet, according to 1973 UC figures, they

are only six per cent of the UC system
student body.
While the nation's unemployment
rate is around seven per cent, in
the chicano communities it is over 15
per cent. And let us not forget that dur
ing the Vietnam War Spanish
speaking constituted 20.4 per cent of
the front line casualties, while they are
only five per cent of the U.S. popula
tion â€” 16 million.
Only when minorities have propor
tional representation in all sectors of
society can we begin to talk, about "re
verse racism."
