# J.P. Stevens

David Miller

The Daily deserves credit for en
couraging, through its republication of
the Barron's editorial, some sense of
balance on the J.P. Stevens issue. It is
indeed curious that our self
proclaimed radicals are so eager to
blindly proclaim the judgment of fed
eral appartchiks (the NLRB) as infalli
ble truth.
How is it that yesterday's apostles of
civil disobedience have become to
day's defenders of law and scourges of
"corporate outlawry?"
To put the matter bluntly, even if it is
proven that J.P. Stevens is in violation
of the law, it does not follow without
argument that they are wrong. Law
and morality are not equivalent: laws
are often wrong.
There was a time when laboring
people were denied by the power of
the law the fundamental right of vol
untary organization and association.
Now, however, the power of gov
ernment is used to restrain the freedom
of speech of persons in management
positions and to abridge the worker's
right to choose to not join a collective
bargaining association.

Is it not possible that these policies
are equally wrong?
I do not wish to suggest that either
J.P. Stevens in particular or corporate
America in general is without failing.
Certainly, business often seeks (with
the connivance of organized labor and
the support — or at least acquiescence
— of both liberals and conservatives)
such rip-offs as protective tariffs, fed
eral loans and subsidies, and
"cooperative" regulatory agencies.
However, J.P. Stevens, or any other
person or organization, deserves to be
judged on the basis of clear evidence
and reasoned argument — rather than
blind propaganda and blanket con
demnations.
In the late 19605, the radicals
brought down a president and ulti
mately ended the war in Southeast
Asia. That today's "rads" have chosen
to uncritically ally themselves with
the racist AFL-CIO and its hawkish,
reactionary leader George Meany is
truly a symbol of the decay of the radi
cal movement.
