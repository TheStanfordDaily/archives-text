# Carter asks for changes in food stamp program
## 
### 
Wa.shington(AP)— President Jimmy
barter asked Congress yesterday to
stop charging food stamp recipients
for the stamps.
Hut about $450 million in food
stamp aid to families with incomes
above the poverty lines would be taken
away under Carter's proposal.
1 he president promised to veto any
congressional changes in his proposal
that would increase by more than $100
million a year the program's current
projected budget of about $5.5 billion
annually.
I he authorizing legislation for the
program, which now helps about 5.44
million families buy groceries each
month, expires Sept. 30. Two congres
sional committees have until May 15
to decide what kind of new program to
approve.
Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland
told the House Agriculture Committee
that Carter's two-year proposal is fis
cally responsible, would benefit the
truly needy, help reduce fraud and
curtail paperwork for recipients and
local welfare offices.
After two years, he said, reform of all
federal welfare programs would be
on its way "and that will be the end of
the food stamp program as we now
know it."
On the average, an eligible family
now has to pay about 44 cents for every
$1 in food stamps. Those with incomes
below $30 a month already get the aid
free.
For example, a three-person family
now has an allotment of $130 a month
in stamps but must pay $57 a month for
them. Under the Carter plan, it would
simply get about $73 in stamps. It
wouldn't pay anything.
Coming up with the necessary cash
is the major barrier for the 50 per cent
of eligible families that don't now par
ticipate in the food stamp program,
bergland said. About 10 per cent of the
eligible families would participate if
the cash requirement were dropped,
he predicted.
Senate Agriculture Committee

Chairman Herman Talmadge (D-Ca.),
is strongly opposed to dropping the
cash requirement.
Bergland said the Carter plan would:
—Bring into the program about
880,000 households that don't have
the cash now to obtain the coupons.
They would come from the ranks of the
elderly, the disabled, rural residents in
the South and those on welfare in
states with low assistance levels.
—Reduce the rolls by about 600,000
families, all of them among the 13 per
cent of recipients with gross incomes
above the official poverty lines. Some
would be ineligible, others would quit

because of sharply reduced benefits at
that level.
—Reduce benefits to about 1.58
million families by more than $5 a
month. The average household now
gets about $72 a month in benefits.
—Maintain or slightly increase be
nefits for the remaining 3.26 million
families among the present recipients.
—Use the $450 million taken from
those who leave to pay for those at
tracted by the dropping of the
purchase-price barrier.
In the end, he said, only 5 per cent of
the caseload would have gross in
comes above the poverty lines.

projected budget of about $5.5 billion
annually.
I he authorizing legislation for the
program, which now helps about 5.44
million families buy groceries each
month, expires Sept. 30. Two congres
sional committees have until May 15
to decide what kind of new program to
approve.
Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland
told the House Agriculture Committee
that Carter's two-year proposal is fis
cally responsible, would benefit the
truly needy, help reduce fraud and
curtail paperwork for recipients and
local welfare offices.
After two years, he said, reform of all
federal welfare programs would be
on its way "and that will be the end of
the food stamp program as we now
know it."
On the average, an eligible family
now has to pay about 44 cents for every
$1 in food stamps. Those with incomes
below $30 a month already get the aid
free.
For example, a three-person family
now has an allotment of $130 a month
in stamps but must pay $57 a month for
them. Under the Carter plan, it would
simply get about $73 in stamps. It
wouldn't pay anything.
Coming up with the necessary cash
is the major barrier for the 50 per cent
of eligible families that don't now par
ticipate in the food stamp program,
bergland said. About 10 per cent of the
eligible families would participate if
the cash requirement were dropped,
he predicted.
Senate Agriculture Committee

Chairman Herman Talmadge (D-Ca.),
is strongly opposed to dropping the
cash requirement.
Bergland said the Carter plan would:
—Bring into the program about
880,000 households that don't have
the cash now to obtain the coupons.
They would come from the ranks of the
elderly, the disabled, rural residents in
the South and those on welfare in
states with low assistance levels.
—Reduce the rolls by about 600,000
families, all of them among the 13 per
cent of recipients with gross incomes
above the official poverty lines. Some
would be ineligible, others would quit

because of sharply reduced benefits at
that level.
—Reduce benefits to about 1.58
million families by more than $5 a
month. The average household now
gets about $72 a month in benefits.
—Maintain or slightly increase be
nefits for the remaining 3.26 million
families among the present recipients.
—Use the $450 million taken from
those who leave to pay for those at
tracted by the dropping of the
purchase-price barrier.
In the end, he said, only 5 per cent of
the caseload would have gross in
comes above the poverty lines.
