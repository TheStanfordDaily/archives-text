## Wine tasting on campus 
### Harry Killas 
With this beautiful weather, there are few ways
to spend afternoons more pleasurably than by re
laxing in the hills with friends, a loaf of French
bread, cheese and a bottle ot wine.
Good quality Rieslings from the Rheingau in
Germany seem like harbingers of spring. This
white wine's fine aromatic characteristics range
from apples to peaches, and have a tantalizing
balance of lusciousness and acid bite. The 1975
Rheingau kabinets was just one of many popular
wine tasting sessions held on campus last quarter.
Forty people rated eight disguised German reisl
ings and ranked the Rudeshimer Berg Rottland
(shipped by Staats, $4.60 a bottle) first; second was
the Steinberger (Staats, $4.30); and in third place,
the fohannisberger Klaus (von Hessen, $4.40).
Another interesting tasting session exposed 70
tasters to the new release Cabernet Sauvignons
from small, "boutique" wineries. These small,
hard-to-find wineries are usually more interesting
to visit because they do not have the herd-like
tours of the huge operations.
Often one can arrange for personal tours at the
small wineries with the winemaker himself by
phoning ahead. Their winers exhibit a more dis
tinctive style than those of the large wineries
which are produced for a nationwide palate.
At the Cabernet tasting, the second bottling of
the 1973 Mt. Eden Vineyards ($l4 a bottle) was
rated first. Tied for second were the 1974 Stag's
Leap ($8.50) and the 1974 Caymus ($7.50). These
wines will age for many years in the bottle, and
although expensive, are considered an excellent
investment.

The success of last quarter's tastings have
prompted the Enology Club to hold eight such
events throughout spring quarter. Blind tastings
will take place every Tuesday until May 24 .it 7:30
at various locations on campus. At Lagunitii :>ip
ing Hall 16 California jug wines will be rated (Ap
ril 12, $2 per person); Zinfandel wines (April 26;
$3 per person); 1975 Moselle Spatlesen (May 31,
$4 per person); and not to be missed is the afforda
ble and available California Cabernet Sauvignons
tastings (May 24; $5 per person). On April 19 four
different years oftwoofthe finest French Chateaux
will be compared; and on May 10, four top Califor
nia Pinct Noirs will be compared with four French
burgundies ($7 per person). For reservations or
more information call 365-1414.
Tastings are excellent opportunities to learn the
characteristics of varieties of wines by noting their
common features and range of differences. It is also
fun to compare opinions to those of the group, to
meet interesting people with common interests
and to enjoy a unique social event.
The Enology Club will again present three sepa
rate lecture series on wine this quarter. The Basic
Tasting (Monday, 7:30) is probably the best series
for beginners. "Perspectives on California Wine"
(Tuesdays at 7:30, $45) each week explores a dif
ferent facet of California wines, such as age, reg
ionality and winemakers' personality.
The European wine class (Wednesdays, $50)
contains essential knowledge for people planning
a trip to Europe. It emphasizes classic wine types,
famous vineyards, soil characteristics, climate,
labelling laws and unique wine history. Call 365-
1414 to register.

famous vineyards, soil characteristics, climate,
labelling laws and unique wine history. Call 365-

With this beautiful weather, there are few ways
to spend afternoons more pleasurably than by re
laxing in the hills with friends, a loaf of French
bread, cheese and a bottle ot wine.
Good quality Rieslings from the Rheingau in
Germany seem like harbingers of spring. This
white wine's fine aromatic characteristics range
from apples to peaches, and have a tantalizing
balance of lusciousness and acid bite. The 1975
Rheingau kabinets was just one of many popular
wine tasting sessions held on campus last quarter.
Forty people rated eight disguised German reisl
ings and ranked the Rudeshimer Berg Rottland
(shipped by Staats, $4.60 a bottle) first; second was
the Steinberger (Staats, $4.30); and in third place,
the fohannisberger Klaus (von Hessen, $4.40).
Another interesting tasting session exposed 70
tasters to the new release Cabernet Sauvignons
from small, "boutique" wineries. These small,
hard-to-find wineries are usually more interesting
to visit because they do not have the herd-like
tours of the huge operations.
Often one can arrange for personal tours at the
small wineries with the winemaker himself by
phoning ahead. Their winers exhibit a more dis
tinctive style than those of the large wineries
which are produced for a nationwide palate.
At the Cabernet tasting, the second bottling of
the 1973 Mt. Eden Vineyards ($l4 a bottle) was
rated first. Tied for second were the 1974 Stag's
Leap ($8.50) and the 1974 Caymus ($7.50). These
wines will age for many years in the bottle, and
although expensive, are considered an excellent
investment.

The success of last quarter's tastings have
prompted the Enology Club to hold eight such
events throughout spring quarter. Blind tastings
will take place every Tuesday until May 24 .it 7:30
at various locations on campus. At Lagunitii :>ip
ing Hall 16 California jug wines will be rated (Ap
ril 12, $2 per person); Zinfandel wines (April 26;
$3 per person); 1975 Moselle Spatlesen (May 31,
$4 per person); and not to be missed is the afforda
ble and available California Cabernet Sauvignons
tastings (May 24; $5 per person). On April 19 four
different years oftwoofthe finest French Chateaux
will be compared; and on May 10, four top Califor
nia Pinct Noirs will be compared with four French
burgundies ($7 per person). For reservations or
more information call 365-1414.
Tastings are excellent opportunities to learn the
characteristics of varieties of wines by noting their
common features and range of differences. It is also
fun to compare opinions to those of the group, to
meet interesting people with common interests
and to enjoy a unique social event.
The Enology Club will again present three sepa
rate lecture series on wine this quarter. The Basic
Tasting (Monday, 7:30) is probably the best series
for beginners. "Perspectives on California Wine"
(Tuesdays at 7:30, $45) each week explores a dif
ferent facet of California wines, such as age, reg
ionality and winemakers' personality.
The European wine class (Wednesdays, $50)
contains essential knowledge for people planning
a trip to Europe. It emphasizes classic wine types,
famous vineyards, soil characteristics, climate,
labelling laws and unique wine history. Call 365-
1414 to register.
