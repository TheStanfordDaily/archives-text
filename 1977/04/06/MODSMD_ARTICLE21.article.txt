### Doug Yoshida 
Would you please explain exactly how the
switchboard system at Stanford operates? I
work in an office in which I must transfer a
great number of incoming calls, a majority of
which are long-distance. Often it takes JO
rings or more before an operator responds to
the transfer signal. Are they that under
staffed?? This is especially embarrassing
when the caller is paying by the minute!
I asked Edna Barnes at University Tele
communications about this, and she replied,
"First of all, we no longer have a switch
board system!"
Since April 1974, the University has had
Centralized Telephone Service (CENTREX).
Under this system, 85 per cent of the incom
ing calls can be dialed directly, with Univer
sity Telecommunications now serving
mainly as an information service,
CENTREX is the system that allows on
campus calls to be dialed using only a five

digit number. Under the old system, calls
had to be made using a four digit extension
number (e.g. ext. 4632).
As for transfer calls, under the old system,
they had priority over incoming calls and
were quickly handled. But with CENTREX,
there is no longer any priority system.
"There is no way flashback (transfer) calls
can be put ahead of others," said Barnes. So
transfer calls must wait in line along with all
other calls waiting to be processed. And dur
ing peak periods, this could take some time.
Barnes also informed me that under the
present system, station users cannot directly
transfer their own calls. This means that all
transfer calls must go through CENTREX at
University Telecommunications, which
handles all calls for the University, Stanford
Hospital and the Medical Center.
If you still have any questions, you might
take a trip to University Telecommunica
tions on Bonair Siding. The staff there is
extremely helpful and will gladly show you
around and answer any questions.

Con you find out how much money would
be saved in fuel costs if an airline flight of a
707 from Oakland to Paris arrived one hour
later than usual, given normal weather con
ditions?
The answer to this question may save my
job!
Thanks!
-L.M.
After talking with Richard Shevell, a con
sulting professor in the Aeronautics and As
tronautics Department, I learned some in
teresting facts. Basically,, Boeing 707s are
already being operated at near minimum
fuel costs. Therefore, by slowing them down,
fuel would actually be lost, not saved!

According to Shevell, if the plans were
slowed up to five percent, some fuel night be
saved, "perhaps two or three per cent." But if
the planes were slowed by one whole hour,
fuel would be lost due to the influence of
such factors as the velocity of the plane,
drag, specific fuel consumption and the
weight of the plane.
I hope this answer hasn't caused you to
join the ranks of the unemployed!

Whuf is thut new smokestack recently
added to the Terman Engineering Building?
I think it looks really ugly.
-R.G.K.
One might think it was added so construc
tion workers could peek down upon the
Roble Gym rooftop, but this is actually not
the case.
According to Gary Kotzin, assistant to the
manager of University construction, the cy
linder is "not a smokestack, but a perchloric
acid stack."
Perchloric acid, as anyone who has taken
the Chem 3D series can tell you, is really
nasty stuff, and the stack is used to detoxify
the fumes before they are released to the at
mosphere. As for the height of the stack, that
is determined by federal regulations.
If perchloric acid stacks turn you on, Rot
zin informs me that there are two others on
campus, one on the new chemistry building
and one on the cancer research building on
Governor's Lane.

manager of University construction, the cy
linder is "not a smokestack, but a perchloric
acid stack."
Perchloric acid, as anyone who has taken
the Chem 3D series can tell you, is really
nasty stuff, and the stack is used to detoxify
the fumes before they are released to the at
mosphere. As for the height of the stack, that
is determined by federal regulations.
If perchloric acid stacks turn you on, Rot
zin informs me that there are two others on
campus, one on the new chemistry building
and one on the cancer research building on
Governor's Lane.

Hey, something "bugging you"? The Bug
is quickly running out of questions, so send
your inquiries in! Just bring them by the
Daily office or send them to: Bug Me, c/o The
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Build
ing, Stanford, CA. 94.W5.

Would you please explain exactly how the
switchboard system at Stanford operates? I
work in an office in which I must transfer a
great number of incoming calls, a majority of
which are long-distance. Often it takes JO
rings or more before an operator responds to
the transfer signal. Are they that under
staffed?? This is especially embarrassing
when the caller is paying by the minute!
I asked Edna Barnes at University Tele
communications about this, and she replied,
"First of all, we no longer have a switch
board system!"
Since April 1974, the University has had
Centralized Telephone Service (CENTREX).
Under this system, 85 per cent of the incom
ing calls can be dialed directly, with Univer
sity Telecommunications now serving
mainly as an information service,
CENTREX is the system that allows on
campus calls to be dialed using only a five

digit number. Under the old system, calls
had to be made using a four digit extension
number (e.g. ext. 4632).
As for transfer calls, under the old system,
they had priority over incoming calls and
were quickly handled. But with CENTREX,
there is no longer any priority system.
"There is no way flashback (transfer) calls
can be put ahead of others," said Barnes. So
transfer calls must wait in line along with all
other calls waiting to be processed. And dur
ing peak periods, this could take some time.
Barnes also informed me that under the
present system, station users cannot directly
transfer their own calls. This means that all
transfer calls must go through CENTREX at
University Telecommunications, which
handles all calls for the University, Stanford
Hospital and the Medical Center.
If you still have any questions, you might
take a trip to University Telecommunica
tions on Bonair Siding. The staff there is
extremely helpful and will gladly show you
around and answer any questions.

Con you find out how much money would
be saved in fuel costs if an airline flight of a
707 from Oakland to Paris arrived one hour
later than usual, given normal weather con
ditions?
The answer to this question may save my
job!
Thanks!
-L.M.
After talking with Richard Shevell, a con
sulting professor in the Aeronautics and As
tronautics Department, I learned some in
teresting facts. Basically,, Boeing 707s are
already being operated at near minimum
fuel costs. Therefore, by slowing them down,
fuel would actually be lost, not saved!

According to Shevell, if the plans were
slowed up to five percent, some fuel night be
saved, "perhaps two or three per cent." But if
the planes were slowed by one whole hour,
fuel would be lost due to the influence of
such factors as the velocity of the plane,
drag, specific fuel consumption and the
weight of the plane.
I hope this answer hasn't caused you to
join the ranks of the unemployed!
