# Colloquiums on adolescence to be held this quarter
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
Adolescence, defined by some
as a "time of stress" between the
ages of 14-24 or by others as "the
period of dependency on paren
tal authority," may still refer to
you.
A new group of lectures is
being offered this quarter, "Ado
lescent Colloquiums." The col
loquiums, which meet every
Thursday from 12-1 p.m. in
Cubberley room es7b, were or
ganized by Jan Van Houten and
Cheryl Perry, two Ph.D. candi
dates in the School of Education.
They were concerned, said
Van Houten, that the School of
Education did not offer any clas
ses in adolescence. "We wanted
to present adolescence from dif
ferent perspectives, so we in
vited professors from all de
partments to speak at our
forum."
"There are a lot of nationally
known adolescent specialists
here, but nobody knows they're

here," said Van Houten. Accord
ing to her, most of the professors
she contacted indicated they had
never had the opportunity to talk
informally with students in their
area of specialization and were
delighted to participate.
The lecturers will discuss
adolescence in relation to law,
medicine, sociology, psychol
ogy and education.
The first lecture, "Youth: It's
Rediscovery," was given last
Thursday by historian David
Tyack from the School of Educa
tion. Van Houten said the meet
ing was "very well attended."
This week's lecture is "Ado
lescents and the Law," given by
Richard Blum from the Law
School. Sociology prof. Sanford
Dornbusch will speak on
"Adolescence's Look at School,"
April 14. April 21 will feature
Cleo Eulau from the School of
Medicine's psychiatry division,
discussing "Adolescent Treat
ment — Group and Individual."

The other colloquiums to be
given are the "Sociology of
Adolescence," by Maureen Hal
liman of the Sociology Dept.,
April 28; "Adolescent
Medicine" by Iris Litt, School of
Medicine's pediatrics division,
Mav 5; "Interventions in Ado
lescent Smoking, Alcohol and
Sexual Problems" by A 1 McAlis
ter, School of Medicine, Be
havioral Sciences, May 12;
"Adolescent Discipline," by
Daniel Duke, of the School of
Education, May 19; and "Ado
lescents and the Law," by Mike
Wald, School of Law, May 26.
Van Houten stressed the col
loquiums are open to people
from all disciplines. "Adoles
cence is the concern of every
body, not just educators," she
asserted.
Light refreshments are served
and bag lunches welcome. "We
try to make it fun and interesting
as well as educational," com
mented Van Houten.

ages of 14-24 or by others as "the
period of dependency on paren
tal authority," may still refer to
you.
A new group of lectures is
being offered this quarter, "Ado
lescent Colloquiums." The col
loquiums, which meet every
Thursday from 12-1 p.m. in
Cubberley room es7b, were or
ganized by Jan Van Houten and
Cheryl Perry, two Ph.D. candi
dates in the School of Education.
They were concerned, said
Van Houten, that the School of
Education did not offer any clas
ses in adolescence. "We wanted
to present adolescence from dif
ferent perspectives, so we in
vited professors from all de
partments to speak at our
forum."
"There are a lot of nationally
known adolescent specialists
here, but nobody knows they're

here," said Van Houten. Accord
ing to her, most of the professors
she contacted indicated they had
never had the opportunity to talk
informally with students in their
area of specialization and were
delighted to participate.
The lecturers will discuss
adolescence in relation to law,
medicine, sociology, psychol
ogy and education.
The first lecture, "Youth: It's
Rediscovery," was given last
Thursday by historian David
Tyack from the School of Educa
tion. Van Houten said the meet
ing was "very well attended."
This week's lecture is "Ado
lescents and the Law," given by
Richard Blum from the Law
School. Sociology prof. Sanford
Dornbusch will speak on
"Adolescence's Look at School,"
April 14. April 21 will feature
Cleo Eulau from the School of
Medicine's psychiatry division,
discussing "Adolescent Treat
ment — Group and Individual."

The other colloquiums to be
given are the "Sociology of
Adolescence," by Maureen Hal
liman of the Sociology Dept.,
April 28; "Adolescent
Medicine" by Iris Litt, School of
Medicine's pediatrics division,
Mav 5; "Interventions in Ado
lescent Smoking, Alcohol and
Sexual Problems" by A 1 McAlis
ter, School of Medicine, Be
havioral Sciences, May 12;
"Adolescent Discipline," by
Daniel Duke, of the School of
Education, May 19; and "Ado
lescents and the Law," by Mike
Wald, School of Law, May 26.
Van Houten stressed the col
loquiums are open to people
from all disciplines. "Adoles
cence is the concern of every
body, not just educators," she
asserted.
Light refreshments are served
and bag lunches welcome. "We
try to make it fun and interesting
as well as educational," com
mented Van Houten.
Adolescence, defined by some
as a "time of stress" between the
ages of 14-24 or by others as "the
period of dependency on paren
