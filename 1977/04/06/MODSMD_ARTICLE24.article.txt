## Card netters edge Bears, 5-4 
### Jill Lieber 
"A champion sustains inten
sity," said tennis coach Dick
Gould. "We just aren't going out
after every match."
I he 10-year (lard mentor is
known for his easygoing outlook
on life and his ear-to-ear grin.
But Gould was not all smiles yes
terday. Even though Stanford
beat Gal, 5-4, Gould was less
than pleased.
"We are not playing up to our
potential," Gould said. "We're
sitting back and worrying about
losing. We're waiting for the
other guy to lose."
Sophomore Matt Mitchell
played well yesterday and seems
more sure of himself than any
other player on the team. Mitch
ell beat Gary Stansbury, 6-4, 6-2.
Cal's No. 1 player, Steve Hahn
was not in the top position be
cause he had a blister on his
hand.
Hahn did, however, combine
forces with teammate Garlos
Aguilar for the No. 2 doubles
team. Bill Maze and John Rast
barely edged out Hahn and
Aguilar in doubles, 1-6.6-3,6-3.
Maze just wasn't up to par.
When he's on his game Gould
said he believes he can beat any
body in college tennis. Yester
day the junior Ail-American
didn't come alive until the last
half of the doubles match.
"That's what I'm talking about
as far as intensity," Gould said.
"Everyone has got to be tough
throughout the whole match."
Maze defeated Gal's Marty
Davis, 7-6, 2-6, 6-3.
Third man John Rast lost to
Gal's Chris Dunk, 6-4, 6-3 and
the man in the fourth slot also
lost. Frosh Jim Hodges was
downed bv Larry Stefanki, 6-3,
6-2.
"We're playing scared,"

Gould said. "We're as good as
anybody. If we don't start play
ing up to our potentials we're
going to get kicked."
Freshman Peter Rennert, play
ing with the flu, beat Cal's
Richard Finger, 7-6, 6-2.
"I really volleyed well," Re
nnert said. The lefthander from
Great Neck, N.Y., said he be
lieved playing with the illness
didn't hamper him.
"It made me concentrate
more," he said. "It took a lot of
the pressure off me. I was told to
gcTout and play hard and when I
started feeling bad to just stop."
Another freshman, Lloyd
Bourne, who played at the No. 5
spot at UCLA and USC last
weekend, also had the flu.
Bourne was too weak to play
singles but teamed with Hodges
to play doubles. He and Hodges
lost to Finger-Stansbury, 7-6,
6-2. Bourne should be back in
the lineup Thursday when the
Cards take on Utah.
At the Cards' No. 6 singles
position yesterday was senior
Alejandro Cortes. Cortes, play
ing his first match in over a
month, lost a heartbreakei to
Aguilar, 6-0, 1-6, 7-6 (0-5). The
Bogota, Colombia native didn't
know he'd be playing until three
hours before the match when
Bourne suddenly became ill.
"I haven't played matches in
such a long time that I became
very nervous," Cortes said. "I
just had to get moving. The first
set was very frustrating because
Carlos was hitting all good shots.
"In the tie breaker I missed a
forehand, a lob, a backhand . . . 1
think I tried too hard to hit the
ball."
At the No. 1 doubles spot
Mitchell and Perry Wright were
together again as doubles
partners, defeating Dunk and

Davis, 6-4, 6-4.
Wright came down with the
stomach flu when the Cards
were in Los Angeles last
weekend. He played only one
singles match Friday.
Gould said Wright will be
back in the lineup oh Thursday.
"Perry is my most consistent
player right now," the coach
said. "1 was super-pleased with
the way he and Matt played with
such intensity in their doubles
match."
Thursday Stanford takes on
No. 14 Utah which is out in the

Bay Area for four matches.
Utah beat tough Canada Junior
College, 6-3, yesterday and plays
Cal today. Friday, Utah takes on
the Northern California All-Stars
at Stockton.
