# Making waves
## Winning attitudes 
### Jill Lieber 
Vlnny people take sports too seriously. Win
ning is worshipped,the athlete is considered the
super hero, record breaking is the greatest goal
and the proof of strong character is the degree to
which physical punishment is absorbed.
The famous statement attributed to the late
Green Bay Packer coach Vince Lombardi comes
to mind when thinking of the pressures in pro
fessional and collegiate sports: "Winning isn't
everything — it's the only thing."
Former University of Minnesota basketball
coach Bill Mussleman posted a sign over the
shower in his locker room that read: "Defeat is
worse than death because you have to live with
defeat."
Ohio State's Woody Hayes found defeat dis
tasteful after Ohio State lost to UCLA in the 1976
Rose Bowl. Hayes snubbed reporters after the
game and for a mon*h afterward.
A major television network produced a short
film recapping the Pittsburgh Steelers' 1975
Super Bowl win. Instead of background com
mentary on the game there was just a recording
of Robert Goulet singing "The Impossible
Dream" from Man of La Mancha. The lyrics
spoke of fighting the unbeatable foe and reach
ing the unreachable stars as 22 men lumbered
their way around the field, moving a ball from
yard line to yard line, banging up opponents in
their path.
Most people — Little Leaguers, college
athletes, recreational players and pros buy the
"impossible dream" fantasy and glorify each
win.
Stanford athletes are accustomed to winning
— both in and out of the athletic world. To even
get mentioned in coaches' recruiting confer
ences, high school prospects have got to be na
tional caliber and able to compete in high
powered collegiate athletics.
"Winning is different for Stanford students
than athletes at other schools," said track coach
Payton Jordan. "Winning isn't all-consuming to
them. They've had success in many ways.
Others with different social, psychological and
intellectual backgrounds may hunger for suc
cess more."
Stanford's 1977 NCAA 100-yard freestyle
champion Dave Fairbank has "hungered" for
success the last five years. As an age-group
swimmer he won races left and right but was
counted out in national circles until his NCAA

win. He won a trip to the University Games in
Bulgaria because of his NCAA title.
"I had done a lot of winning up to 1972,"
Fairbank said. "Then 1 went through a major
slump."
World record holder in the 200-meter fly,
Mike Bruner, was not alwaysanathleticsuccess.
He was "always the guy who screwed things up"
in Little League until he found a sport better
suited for him.
Water polo standout Robby Arnold isn't
necessarily a natural water polo player. He has
been working all his life to play polo under Stan
ford's recently resigned coach Art Lambert.
"Winning to me is having more points on the
scoreboard than the other team," he said. "But at
the same time, and probably more importantly, 1
am satisfied when I know that I have worked
well with the rest of the team and they have
performed up to their abilities. 1 am happiest
when my teammates do their best."
"Success-oriented people like to be success
ful," Jordan said. "We strive to realize goals and
the potential we think we have. Most goals are
self-imposed. Winning is satisfying the ac
complishments that we believe we should ac
complish.
"Yet in any competition, many victories are
won — and not shown by blue ribbons or gold
medals. If a time is improved or tensions and
fears are overcome then we can be satisfied."
Jordan said there is little difference between
the way a world-class athlete and a good, hard
working competitor, look at winning.
"The lesser recognized performer often times
has greater drive and commitment than the one
on top," Jordan said. "The winner has a definite
commitment and is disciplined to reach that
commitment but often times is hard to motivate.
Once you're on the top it's more fun than being
at the bottom — all athletes know that. When
you're riding the crest of the wave you can see
everything around you."
Every athlete, no matter what level he or she is
at, wants to reach a pinnacle. Each has his own
ideasabout winning which vary, most obviously
between individual and team sports.
"We each march to a different drummer," Jor
dan said. "Winning is similar but different in
ways. Many victories are won that can't be de
scribed."
Said Fairbank. now an international figure,
"My win can't be put into words."

Former University of Minnesota basketball
coach Bill Mussleman posted a sign over the
shower in his locker room that read: "Defeat is
worse than death because you have to live with
defeat."
Ohio State's Woody Hayes found defeat dis
tasteful after Ohio State lost to UCLA in the 1976
Rose Bowl. Hayes snubbed reporters after the
game and for a mon*h afterward.
A major television network produced a short
film recapping the Pittsburgh Steelers' 1975
Super Bowl win. Instead of background com
mentary on the game there was just a recording
of Robert Goulet singing "The Impossible
Dream" from Man of La Mancha. The lyrics
spoke of fighting the unbeatable foe and reach
ing the unreachable stars as 22 men lumbered
their way around the field, moving a ball from
yard line to yard line, banging up opponents in
their path.
Most people — Little Leaguers, college
athletes, recreational players and pros buy the
"impossible dream" fantasy and glorify each
win.
Stanford athletes are accustomed to winning
— both in and out of the athletic world. To even
get mentioned in coaches' recruiting confer
ences, high school prospects have got to be na
tional caliber and able to compete in high
powered collegiate athletics.
"Winning is different for Stanford students
than athletes at other schools," said track coach
Payton Jordan. "Winning isn't all-consuming to
them. They've had success in many ways.
Others with different social, psychological and
intellectual backgrounds may hunger for suc
cess more."
Stanford's 1977 NCAA 100-yard freestyle
champion Dave Fairbank has "hungered" for
success the last five years. As an age-group
swimmer he won races left and right but was
counted out in national circles until his NCAA

win. He won a trip to the University Games in
Bulgaria because of his NCAA title.
"I had done a lot of winning up to 1972,"
Fairbank said. "Then 1 went through a major
slump."
World record holder in the 200-meter fly,
Mike Bruner, was not alwaysanathleticsuccess.
He was "always the guy who screwed things up"
in Little League until he found a sport better
suited for him.
Water polo standout Robby Arnold isn't
necessarily a natural water polo player. He has
been working all his life to play polo under Stan
ford's recently resigned coach Art Lambert.
"Winning to me is having more points on the
scoreboard than the other team," he said. "But at
the same time, and probably more importantly, 1
am satisfied when I know that I have worked
well with the rest of the team and they have
performed up to their abilities. 1 am happiest
when my teammates do their best."
"Success-oriented people like to be success
ful," Jordan said. "We strive to realize goals and
the potential we think we have. Most goals are
self-imposed. Winning is satisfying the ac
complishments that we believe we should ac
complish.
"Yet in any competition, many victories are
won — and not shown by blue ribbons or gold
medals. If a time is improved or tensions and
fears are overcome then we can be satisfied."
Jordan said there is little difference between
the way a world-class athlete and a good, hard
working competitor, look at winning.
"The lesser recognized performer often times
has greater drive and commitment than the one
on top," Jordan said. "The winner has a definite
commitment and is disciplined to reach that
commitment but often times is hard to motivate.
Once you're on the top it's more fun than being
at the bottom — all athletes know that. When
you're riding the crest of the wave you can see
everything around you."
Every athlete, no matter what level he or she is
at, wants to reach a pinnacle. Each has his own
ideasabout winning which vary, most obviously
between individual and team sports.
"We each march to a different drummer," Jor
dan said. "Winning is similar but different in
ways. Many victories are won that can't be de
scribed."
Said Fairbank. now an international figure,
"My win can't be put into words."
Vlnny people take sports too seriously. Win
ning is worshipped,the athlete is considered the
super hero, record breaking is the greatest goal
and the proof of strong character is the degree to
which physical punishment is absorbed.
The famous statement attributed to the late
Green Bay Packer coach Vince Lombardi comes
to mind when thinking of the pressures in pro
fessional and collegiate sports: "Winning isn't
everything — it's the only thing."
