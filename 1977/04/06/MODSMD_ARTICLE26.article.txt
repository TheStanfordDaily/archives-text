# Oarsmen finish third in Cal Cup race
## 
### 
At last weekend's San Diego Crew Classic,
the Stanford crew did about as well as
everyone expected â€” everyone except the
Stanford crew.
With a rare overabundance of depth and
talent, crew coach Sam Francis said he felt
that this could be the season to pull some
surprises. But at this year's Glassic, with
more than 20 schools entered for one of the
year's biggest regattas, the three Stanford
eights surprised no one. beating the teams
they were expected to beat and losing to the
teams that were expected to defeat them.
Francis, coach of last year's successful
frosh eight, became varsity coach at the be
ginning of the fall quarter, succeeding Dick
Dreissegacker.
Strong foundation
With only two seniors lost to graduation
and the return of last year's freshman squad,
the varsity program appeared to have a
strong foundation for a promising season.
After intense intrasquad competition dur
ing the winter term. Francis decided to fill
the varsity shell with team captain Miles

White, Marshall Payne, John Montgomery,
Mike Glass, Steve Messner, Bob Werle, Ted
Gorlin, Kirk Wilson and coxswain Laurie
Levinson.
On Saturday the varsity oarsmen finished
third in a six-team race for the California
Cup, 12 seconds behind IJC-lrvine and one
second behind USC. The Cards finished the
2000-meter course in 6:37.9, defeating San
Diego State, Long Beach State and UC-San
Diego.
Strategic start
The Card eight employed a new strategy
Saturday, lowering the stroke rate to 32-34
strokes per minute early in the race. Francis
said he hoped this would allow the Cards to
have a strong middle 1000-meters where
most crews slack off because of the exhaust
ing early pace.
Strokesman White settled the boat per
fectly into the prescribed 33 strokes per mi
nute pace. But despite the new tactics, Irvi ne
proved too powerful, increasing its lead
through each 500 meters to win by three boat
lengths.
Francis said he was pleased with the

junior varsity's victory in the petite (consola
tion) finals of its division. Rowing what he
termed "a very smooth race," the JV eight
powered ahead of the six-boat field at the
500-meter mark and maintained a boat
length on second-place Irvine for the en
tirety of the race, finishing in 6:57.1.
The freshman eight, under the guidance of
new coach Tim Odell, took third in its petite
final. After a shaky winter quarter, the frosh
squad coalesced during spring break and
Odell sees more improvement ahead with
each race.
In other events, a lightweight four, includ
ing Francis and Odell, placed second. The
varsity four took fourth and the women's
eight placed sixth in its petite final.
Overall Francis said he felt that the Cards
were hurt most by lack of confidence, this
being Stanford's first race of the season. In
addition to opening race jitters, the Cards
rowed before 13,000 spectators this
weekend.

tories when Stanford hosts USC and Santa
Clara at Belmont Shores Saturday morning.
