The Student Athletic Commit
tee is conducting a survey on
student needs in physical educa
tion and athletics at Stanford.
The committee will send out a
questionnaire tomorrow to every
student in an effort to help the
Athletic Department administra
tion and staff determine how
well the department meets the
expectations of the students in
physical education classes, in
tramurals, club sports and var
sity sports.
In the past there has been a
wide range of opinion among
students as to what they want in
physical education. Some comp
lain of too few tennis courts.
Some complain of not a wide
enough variety of classes. Others
say they don't know what
facilities are for use by students
and don't know when those

facilities are open.
"The University is committed
to suiting students on the per
sonal and varsity levels, but this
can only be done if the need is
more clearly defined," said
George Pegelow, a major coor
dinator of the questionnaire. The
Student Athletic Committee
spent nine months writing the
questionnaire which it believes
will help the Athletic Depart
ment determine the value of ath
letics at Stanford.
Everyone affected
"This questionnaire is going
to affect everyone," Pegelow
said. "It affects the guy who runs
around the track for fun as well
as the guy who is on the football
team."
The inequalities between men s
and women's sports will also be
explored. Information from the
questionnaire will be used to see
'how well Stanford is complying
with Title IX.
The question of the need for a
new fieldhouse and the facilities
within will also be looked at.
University funded
"We want to know the stu
dent's interests," Pegelow said.
"It's important that everyone
fills out the questionnaire."
The questionnaire is funded
by the University and will be
sent via first class mail. Origi
nally, when the committee
began formulating questions
earlier in the year, money for the
mailing and tabulating of results
was to have come from sources
other than the University.
"There will be computer
analysis of the questionnaire,"
explained Pegelow. "And each
questionnaire will be accom
panied by a return envelope.
"It's entirely a grass roots
thing. Students will be in charge
of key punching the question
naire. The questionnaire is not
bureaucratic."
