# Libby Docker: 'Practice Makes Perfect'
## 
### Jill Lieber 
Golfer Libby Docker is a
perfectionist in everything
she does. She practices all the
time. Even when it comes to
her favorite hobbies —
photography, pottery and
cooking — Docker can't stand
putting in half efforts.
She spends hours upcn
hours in the confines of the
Wilbur basement working on
pots. I ler recipe file is bulging
and roommates say she's
often times lured into the
kitchen by the smell of some
thing cooking and compul
sively adds a dash of this or
that to the concoctions.
Last quarter she was out on
the course some mornings as
early as 8 a.m. This quarter
she hits balls or plays practice
holes along with wuitressing
two nights a week until 2 a.m.
and attending classes. She's
not happy unless she's doing
something and doing it right.
Even Docker herself finds
her meticulous attitude frus
trating.
"If I go out to practice chip
ping and I shank 10 out of 30
balls I can lose my confidence
the rest of the week. But I'm
too stubborn to quit practic
ing. I'll keep right on chip
ping and shanking. It's
stupid. I know I should just
quit."
Teammate Ellen Sale said,
"She's always practicing. She
works hard until she is happy
with what she has done. She
makes me feel guilty when I
don't practice."
Docker said she believes a
large part of her golf game is
in her mind. Now working

her way back into the lineup
after taking last quarter off
from school, she hopes to be
in the team's top three.
"An awful lot of my game
has to do with the confidence
I have in my mind and the
belief 1 have in myself that my
game is in good shape. If I'm
insecure in any way, once I
step over the ball I won't
stroke it right."
Docker has been a member
of the women's team si nee her
freshman year when she was
one of only two golfers who
competed for Stanford. Since
then she has seen rapid im
provement of the program.
"We now get a lot more
money. This year's team is
taking five trips compared to
my freshman year when we
only went on one to nationals
in San Diego."
Golf on the Farm has no
country club atmosphere.
Almost anything goes on the
Stanford Course.
"A country club atmos
phere to me means poshness
— dress codes and for
malities. Here it's just a game.
People can wear cut-offs,
guys don't have to wear shirts
and there are joggers all over
the bourse.
"There are still country
clubs where women must
wear their skirts two inches
above the knee. Sometimes
women wear hot pants which
is ridiculous because when
you bend over the ball you
show everything."
Golf has a stigma of Ijeing a
businessmen's or middle
aged women's game with the
golf cart doing all the leg

work. Yet Docker, who is an
avid skiier and swimmer,
finds golf a good deal ot exer
cise.
"Golf can be a lot of exer
cise," she said. "Walking 1H
holes and carrying a bag of
clubs puts strain on your
muscles. Especially on the
Stanford Golf Course where it
is so hilly. If you're not in
shape you'll start to feel tired
by the ninth hole. Then on the
16th where it's all up hill and
a par 5, you'll die."
Docker started playing golf
when she was six years old.
Her family lived on a golf
course and her mom encour
aged each of the five kids to
play.
"There were always bam
boo clubs lying around so my
brother and 1 would hack
around. We'd get scores of 20
on just one hole and think we
were great."
Her twin sisters Penny and
Patty, 32, played golf for Stan
ford and her brother Jimmy is
a freshman on the Menlo Col
lege team.
"My sisters can't believe
how much golf has changed,"
she said. "When they were
here they hardly did any
traveling and never prac
ticed."
Coach Carroll Diaz said
Docker is a "natural."
"1 have a natural swing,"
Docker said. "Because 1
learned so long ago, Mrs. Diaz
can't change my game. A lot
of habits have built up —
good and bad."
Docker was recently able to
correct a flaw in her game

without the help of any golf
pro.
"I am strong on the right
side and. in golf you've got to
have a strong left arm —
you've got to be willing to
make the right arm do no
thing.
"While cocktail waitres
sing (the past few wepks), I
have to hold the tray in my
left hand to serve with my
right. I'm stronger now be
cause of it. 1 don't need as
much club."
Docker said the men and
women do not formally prac
tice together, but she tries to
play with male golfers to
sharpen her own game.
"1 think we should play
more with the men," she said.
"Most guys have played such
a long time that their com
petitive experience has made
their game more refined.
They have specialized shots
down pat. 1 learn a lot from
playing with men."
Just as "too many cooks
.spoil the broth." too many
pros spoil the golfer.
"My freshman year 1 didn't
know any better and would
listen to every man at the
driving range who'd give me
pointers," she said.
"Whenever men see a girl
coming they want to tell her
what she's doing wrong. It's
only more confusing.
"If you don't know your
game well, then don't listen
to anybody but one person —
your pro. One of the most im
portant things I've learned is
don't ever listen to what any
body tells vou."

the course some mornings as
early as 8 a.m. This quarter
she hits balls or plays practice
holes along with wuitressing
two nights a week until 2 a.m.
and attending classes. She's
not happy unless she's doing
something and doing it right.
Even Docker herself finds
her meticulous attitude frus
trating.
"If I go out to practice chip
ping and I shank 10 out of 30
balls I can lose my confidence
the rest of the week. But I'm
too stubborn to quit practic
ing. I'll keep right on chip
ping and shanking. It's
stupid. I know I should just
quit."
Teammate Ellen Sale said,
"She's always practicing. She
works hard until she is happy
with what she has done. She
makes me feel guilty when I
don't practice."
Docker said she believes a
large part of her golf game is
in her mind. Now working

her way back into the lineup
after taking last quarter off
from school, she hopes to be
in the team's top three.
"An awful lot of my game
has to do with the confidence
I have in my mind and the
belief 1 have in myself that my
game is in good shape. If I'm
insecure in any way, once I
step over the ball I won't
stroke it right."
Docker has been a member
of the women's team si nee her
freshman year when she was
one of only two golfers who
competed for Stanford. Since
then she has seen rapid im
provement of the program.
"We now get a lot more
money. This year's team is
taking five trips compared to
my freshman year when we
only went on one to nationals
in San Diego."
Golf on the Farm has no
country club atmosphere.
Almost anything goes on the
Stanford Course.
"A country club atmos
phere to me means poshness
— dress codes and for
malities. Here it's just a game.
People can wear cut-offs,
guys don't have to wear shirts
and there are joggers all over
the bourse.
"There are still country
clubs where women must
wear their skirts two inches
above the knee. Sometimes
women wear hot pants which
is ridiculous because when
you bend over the ball you
show everything."
Golf has a stigma of Ijeing a
businessmen's or middle
aged women's game with the
golf cart doing all the leg

work. Yet Docker, who is an
avid skiier and swimmer,
finds golf a good deal ot exer
cise.
"Golf can be a lot of exer
cise," she said. "Walking 1H
holes and carrying a bag of
clubs puts strain on your
muscles. Especially on the
Stanford Golf Course where it
is so hilly. If you're not in
shape you'll start to feel tired
by the ninth hole. Then on the
16th where it's all up hill and
a par 5, you'll die."
Docker started playing golf
when she was six years old.
Her family lived on a golf
course and her mom encour
aged each of the five kids to
play.
"There were always bam
boo clubs lying around so my
brother and 1 would hack
around. We'd get scores of 20
on just one hole and think we
were great."
Her twin sisters Penny and
Patty, 32, played golf for Stan
ford and her brother Jimmy is
a freshman on the Menlo Col
lege team.
"My sisters can't believe
how much golf has changed,"
she said. "When they were
here they hardly did any
traveling and never prac
ticed."
Coach Carroll Diaz said
Docker is a "natural."
"1 have a natural swing,"
Docker said. "Because 1
learned so long ago, Mrs. Diaz
can't change my game. A lot
of habits have built up —
good and bad."
Docker was recently able to
correct a flaw in her game

without the help of any golf
pro.
"I am strong on the right
side and. in golf you've got to
have a strong left arm —
you've got to be willing to
make the right arm do no
thing.
"While cocktail waitres
sing (the past few wepks), I
have to hold the tray in my
left hand to serve with my
right. I'm stronger now be
cause of it. 1 don't need as
much club."
Docker said the men and
women do not formally prac
tice together, but she tries to
play with male golfers to
sharpen her own game.
"1 think we should play
more with the men," she said.
"Most guys have played such
a long time that their com
petitive experience has made
their game more refined.
They have specialized shots
down pat. 1 learn a lot from
playing with men."
Just as "too many cooks
.spoil the broth." too many
pros spoil the golfer.
"My freshman year 1 didn't
know any better and would
listen to every man at the
driving range who'd give me
pointers," she said.
"Whenever men see a girl

what she's doing wrong. It's
only more confusing.
"If you don't know your

ing. I'll keep right on chip
ping and shanking. It's
stupid. I know I should just
quit."
Teammate Ellen Sale said,
"She's always practicing. She
works hard until she is happy
with what she has done. She
makes me feel guilty when I
don't practice."
Docker said she believes a
large part of her golf game is
in her mind. Now working

her way back into the lineup
after taking last quarter off
from school, she hopes to be
in the team's top three.
"An awful lot of my game
has to do with the confidence
I have in my mind and the
belief 1 have in myself that my
game is in good shape. If I'm
insecure in any way, once I
step over the ball I won't
stroke it right."
Docker has been a member
of the women's team si nee her
freshman year when she was
one of only two golfers who
competed for Stanford. Since
then she has seen rapid im
provement of the program.
"We now get a lot more
money. This year's team is
taking five trips compared to
my freshman year when we
only went on one to nationals
in San Diego."
Golf on the Farm has no
country club atmosphere.
Almost anything goes on the
Stanford Course.
"A country club atmos
phere to me means poshness
— dress codes and for
malities. Here it's just a game.
People can wear cut-offs,
guys don't have to wear shirts
and there are joggers all over
the bourse.
"There are still country
clubs where women must
wear their skirts two inches
above the knee. Sometimes
women wear hot pants which
is ridiculous because when
you bend over the ball you
show everything."
Golf has a stigma of Ijeing a
businessmen's or middle
aged women's game with the
golf cart doing all the leg

work. Yet Docker, who is an
avid skiier and swimmer,
finds golf a good deal ot exer
cise.
"Golf can be a lot of exer
cise," she said. "Walking 1H
holes and carrying a bag of
clubs puts strain on your
muscles. Especially on the
Stanford Golf Course where it
is so hilly. If you're not in
shape you'll start to feel tired
by the ninth hole. Then on the
16th where it's all up hill and
a par 5, you'll die."
Docker started playing golf
when she was six years old.
Her family lived on a golf
course and her mom encour
aged each of the five kids to
play.
"There were always bam
boo clubs lying around so my
brother and 1 would hack
around. We'd get scores of 20
on just one hole and think we
were great."
Her twin sisters Penny and
Patty, 32, played golf for Stan
ford and her brother Jimmy is
a freshman on the Menlo Col
lege team.
"My sisters can't believe
how much golf has changed,"
she said. "When they were
here they hardly did any
traveling and never prac
ticed."
Coach Carroll Diaz said
Docker is a "natural."
"1 have a natural swing,"
Docker said. "Because 1
learned so long ago, Mrs. Diaz
can't change my game. A lot
of habits have built up —
good and bad."
Docker was recently able to
correct a flaw in her game

without the help of any golf
pro.
"I am strong on the right
side and. in golf you've got to
have a strong left arm —
you've got to be willing to
make the right arm do no
thing.
"While cocktail waitres
sing (the past few wepks), I
have to hold the tray in my
left hand to serve with my
right. I'm stronger now be
cause of it. 1 don't need as
much club."
Docker said the men and
women do not formally prac
tice together, but she tries to
play with male golfers to
sharpen her own game.
"1 think we should play
more with the men," she said.
"Most guys have played such
a long time that their com
petitive experience has made
their game more refined.
They have specialized shots
down pat. 1 learn a lot from
playing with men."
Just as "too many cooks
.spoil the broth." too many
pros spoil the golfer.
"My freshman year 1 didn't
know any better and would
listen to every man at the
driving range who'd give me
pointers," she said.
"Whenever men see a girl
coming they want to tell her
what she's doing wrong. It's
only more confusing.
"If you don't know your
game well, then don't listen
to anybody but one person —
your pro. One of the most im
portant things I've learned is
don't ever listen to what any
body tells vou."

Libby Docker
Golfer Libby Docker is a
perfectionist in everything
she does. She practices all the
time. Even when it comes to
her favorite hobbies —
photography, pottery and
cooking — Docker can't stand
putting in half efforts.
She spends hours upcn
hours in the confines of the
Wilbur basement working on
pots. I ler recipe file is bulging
and roommates say she's
often times lured into the
kitchen by the smell of some
thing cooking and compul
sively adds a dash of this or
that to the concoctions.
Last quarter she was out on
the course some mornings as
early as 8 a.m. This quarter
she hits balls or plays practice
holes along with wuitressing
two nights a week until 2 a.m.
and attending classes. She's
not happy unless she's doing
something and doing it right.
Even Docker herself finds
her meticulous attitude frus
trating.
"If I go out to practice chip
ping and I shank 10 out of 30
balls I can lose my confidence
the rest of the week. But I'm
too stubborn to quit practic
ing. I'll keep right on chip
ping and shanking. It's

quit."
