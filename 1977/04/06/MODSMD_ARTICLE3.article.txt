# Survey on ASSU shows voter apathy
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Although the ASSU Council of Pres
idents (COP) election is scheduled for
next week, a majority of students ques
tioned in a registration day survey did
not know what the COP does, nor did
they know the names of current COP
members.
The purpose of the survey, which
was conducted by junior Jiri Weiss was
to see how mucii students know about
the ASSU Senate and the COP.
"1 wanted to dramatize the fact that
most students don't know what stu
dent government is and don't care,"
Weiss explained.
Weiss distributed questionnaires to
students waiting to pick up t heir grade
reports in Maples Pavilion on registra
tion day this quarter. Out of 250 sur
veys handed out, 184 were returned.
Only 27 replies were from graduate
students, said Weiss.
More than three fourths of the stu
dents surveyed said they had never
spoken with an ASSU senator about
campus issues.
One mutiple-choice question asked

how much ASSU resources are. "The
majority of students said they had no
idea, and only six per cent chose the
correct answer—about $1.5 million.
Another question asked students
what issues they would like to see
brought up in the upcoming COP elec
tion. According to Weiss, the most
common reply was a question mark.
Some of the issues whch were
suggested several times included the
Bakke case, tenure, University invest
ments, graduation requirements and
recycling.
Asked if they intended to vote in the
COP election, 73 per cent of the stu
dents surveyed said they did. How
ever, Weiss said he does not consider
this a true indication of the expected
voter turnout.
Weiss commented that when he
asked students to participate in the
survey, a common reply was, "1 can't
fill this out. 1 don't know anything.
"After answering the questions, some
students felt guilty and said they were
going to find out more about student
government here."
