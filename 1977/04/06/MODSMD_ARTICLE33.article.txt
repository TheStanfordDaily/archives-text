Sadat makes bid for U.S. weaponry
Washington — Egypt's President Anwar Sadat
made a bid for American weapons to President
Jimmy Carter yesterday, but a White House spokes
man said "no commitments or decisions are antici
pated."
At their windup session, the two leaders surveyed
Soviet and Cuban intervention in Africa and joined
in an appeal for peaceful settlement of conflicts and
territorial integrity there.
The one concrete result of the visit announced by
the White House was U.S. support for a hydrog
raphic survey of the Gulf of Suez.
Carter Press Secretary Jody Powell said the $7.5-
million, six-month project is intended to expand
ship traffic and oil drilling. Powell did not indicate
how much this would cost the United States.
Sadat's appeal for arms is known to include "lots"
of Northrop F5 jets and TOW anti-tank missiles, but
U.S. officials said no list was presented to Carter.
Investigator seeks Sirhan interview
Los Angeles — A Los Angeles County supervisor
suggested yesterday that an attorney appointed to
probe the killing of Sen. Robert Kennedy press ef
forts to interview convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan.
Special counsel Thomas Kranz said he would con
tact Sirhan's attorney today and make a second re
quest to visit Sirhan at Soledad Prison.
"1 think historians who will record this event will
say, 'Why didn't somebody talk to Sirhan?' " said
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who urged the visit.
The suggestion came as Kranz submitted to the
supervisors the i;JS-page report on his 15-month
long probe of Kennedy's June 5, 1968, assassination.
The supervisors set a May 17 public hearing on the
report.
Kranz concluded that Sirhan was the lone gunman
who shot Kennedy in a pantry of the Ambassador
Hotel.
Of his investigation into Sirhan's motivation,
Kranz said, "Heappears to have been a pathetic loner
who was tormented by remembrances of his early
life."

'Moonie' legal tug-of-war continues
San Francisco — The parents ot five "Moonies'
were ordered yesterday to bring the adult children to
an appellate court hearing in the legal tug-of-war
they were conducting with the Unification Church.
The state Court of Appeal scheduled the hearing
for next Monday to hear the church's arguments that
California's temporary conservatorship law, used by
the parents to gain temporary custody, is unconstitu
tional.
The church claims the law violates constitutional
rights to freedom of religion.
The parents of the five followers of Korean
evangelist Sun Myung Moon were granted on March
24 temporary custody of their children on grounds
they had been "brainwashed" by the church.
The decision, made by a Superior Court judge, was
immediately appealed. Three of the young adults
have stated they have decided to leave the church.
The appeals court said it will also consider
whether to appoint a third party, probably another
judge, to decide if the parents should be held in
contempt for defying a court order to keep deprog
rammers away from the young adults pending the
appellate hearing.

Sadat makes bid for U.S. weaponry
Washington — Egypt's President Anwar Sadat
made a bid for American weapons to President
Jimmy Carter yesterday, but a White House spokes
man said "no commitments or decisions are antici
pated."
At their windup session, the two leaders surveyed
Soviet and Cuban intervention in Africa and joined
in an appeal for peaceful settlement of conflicts and
territorial integrity there.
The one concrete result of the visit announced by
the White House was U.S. support for a hydrog
raphic survey of the Gulf of Suez.
Carter Press Secretary Jody Powell said the $7.5-
million, six-month project is intended to expand
ship traffic and oil drilling. Powell did not indicate
how much this would cost the United States.
Sadat's appeal for arms is known to include "lots"
of Northrop F5 jets and TOW anti-tank missiles, but
U.S. officials said no list was presented to Carter.
Investigator seeks Sirhan interview
Los Angeles — A Los Angeles County supervisor
suggested yesterday that an attorney appointed to
probe the killing of Sen. Robert Kennedy press ef
forts to interview convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan.
Special counsel Thomas Kranz said he would con
tact Sirhan's attorney today and make a second re
quest to visit Sirhan at Soledad Prison.
"1 think historians who will record this event will
say, 'Why didn't somebody talk to Sirhan?' " said
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who urged the visit.
The suggestion came as Kranz submitted to the
supervisors the i;JS-page report on his 15-month
long probe of Kennedy's June 5, 1968, assassination.
The supervisors set a May 17 public hearing on the
report.
Kranz concluded that Sirhan was the lone gunman
who shot Kennedy in a pantry of the Ambassador
Hotel.
Of his investigation into Sirhan's motivation,
Kranz said, "Heappears to have been a pathetic loner
who was tormented by remembrances of his early
life."

'Moonie' legal tug-of-war continues
San Francisco — The parents ot five "Moonies'
were ordered yesterday to bring the adult children to
an appellate court hearing in the legal tug-of-war
they were conducting with the Unification Church.
The state Court of Appeal scheduled the hearing
for next Monday to hear the church's arguments that
California's temporary conservatorship law, used by
the parents to gain temporary custody, is unconstitu
tional.
The church claims the law violates constitutional
rights to freedom of religion.
The parents of the five followers of Korean
evangelist Sun Myung Moon were granted on March
24 temporary custody of their children on grounds
they had been "brainwashed" by the church.
The decision, made by a Superior Court judge, was
immediately appealed. Three of the young adults
have stated they have decided to leave the church.
The appeals court said it will also consider
whether to appoint a third party, probably another
judge, to decide if the parents should be held in
contempt for defying a court order to keep deprog
rammers away from the young adults pending the
appellate hearing.
