# D.A. to ask Court to review 'Daily' case

### Kurt Cobb 
The Santa Clara County District At
torney's office will ask the U.S. Sup
reme Court to review the decision of
two lower courts that a 1971 search of
Daily offices by four Palo Alto police
men was unconstitutional, according
to County Counsel Selby Brown.
The state attorney general's office
wil 1 be aiding the county until the case
is settled and has assigned Dep. Atty.
Cen. Cene Caster to act as co-counsel,
Brown added.
On Feb. 2, 1977 the U.S. Ninth Cir
cuit Court of Appeals upheld a federal
district court ruling tbat the search
violated the First and Fourth Amend
ments. It subsequently denied the
county's petition for a rehearing.
The county is asking the court to
review this case "on the grounds of a
unique case of law," said Rick Ab
dalah, a deputy district attorney for the

county.
A petition to stay the effect of the
circuit court ruling has already been
granted, giving the county 30 days to
decide how to proceed in the case.
Refusal possible
The county is allowed to petition the
Supreme Court to hear the case, but
under this procedure, the court may
refuse. Therefore the county is looking
into the possibility of appealing the
case, which would bind the court to
hear it, according to Brown.
However, Law School Prof. )ohn
Kaplan, noting that there are narrow
restrictions on the types of cases that
can be appealed, said he felt the case
would not qualify. What is at stake, he
explained, is "not the validity of a sta
tute, but merely the application" of
one.
The 1972 district court decision by
Judge Robert Peckham said police

should employ the "least drastic
means" available when seeking evi
dence from nonsuspects.
The police with the help of then
Dist. Atty. Louis Bergna obtained a
search warrant, which gave the Daily
no advance warning, rather than a
subpoena, which the Daily could have
attempted to quash.
The case, Stanford Daily v. Zurcher,
resulted from a raid on Daily offices by
Palo Alto police on April 12, 1971.
Equipped with a search warrant,
police ransacked files, desks and was
tebaskets, looking for photographic
evidence to use against participants in
an April 9,1971 riot at Stanford Hospi
tal.
First time
It was the first known time in U.S.
history police used a warrant to search
a news organization for evidence, ac
cording to Daily attorney Jerome Falk

Jr. But since the search, several radio
stations and newspapers, including
Berkeley radio station KPFA-FM and
the Los Angeles Star have experienced
similar raids.
Peckham's opinion, adopted in its
entirety by the Circuit Court, stated
that the search violated Fourth
Amendment protection against "un
reasonable searches and seizures."
"A search warrant should be permit
ted only in rare circumstances where
there is a clear showing that 1) impor
tant materials will be destroyed or re
moved from jurisdiction, and 2) a rest
raining order would be futile," he said.
"To stop short of this standard would
be to sneer at all the First Amendment
has come to represent in our society."
The Palo Alto police, who are co
defendants in the case, are also peti
tioning the Supreme Court to hear the
case.
