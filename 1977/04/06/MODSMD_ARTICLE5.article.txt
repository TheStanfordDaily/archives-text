# Docters slate decries waste
## 
### George Anders 
"I think money is being squandered
here," charged Rob Docters, a candi
date for the ASSU Council of Presi
dents (COP). "If the University
adopted modern—and I don't mean
1910—management techniques, it
could save a lot of money."
Docters is running for the COP with*
Leslie Brettell, Lary Berz and Peter
Hausknecht on a platform that in
cludes several reduced spending

planks.
Slate members say they will use
jcommittee channels to pressure the
University to reduce costs, and will
seek to reduce ASSU costs.
Docters referred to an excess amount
of secretarial work in both the Univer
sity and ASSU. He said he knew of no
other instances of money being squan
dered. but said he was sure studies
would reveal more cases.
Hausknecht stresses his slate seeks

no "blanket zapping of programs," but
would instead examine programs
case-by-case.
Little publicity
The slate has done little publicity
work so far. "We're not fanatical, we're
not busting down doors."
Berz estimated the slate's chance of
being elected at five per cent.
Hausknecht and Brettell saw their
chances as about one-third, though.
None of the slate members have been
in student government. "Naivete can
be an advantage," though, Berz said.
"It gives us more of a fresh approach."
Brettell said she favored having four
ASSU co-presidents, rather than one
president and three vice presidents, as
is now the case. A SWOPSI course last
quarter, led by ASSU Vice President
Carole Houck, recommended such a
change.
'Less power'
Having four co-presidents would -
"give less power to the one president."
Brettell said.
Slate members differed on whether
the COP should be salaried. "I would
do the job probably for nothing." Doc
ters said. But Hausknecht and Brettell
said salaries should be retained so
quality candidates would run for the
offices.
Hausknecht expressed concern that
the COP usually "raises its head dur
ing election time and then sinks back
into the murk. If candidates win, we
never see them again."
Slate members said they would re
main in close contact with students, if


Rob Docters, Lary Berz, Peter Hausknecht, Leslie Bretell
elected. Hausknecht contended that
all of this year's slates, including his,
were making some promises that were
"hogwash. Pragmatically," he said,
"making one or two changes is all we
can expect."
The ASSU, including the COP, will
not be able to assume much of the
decision-making power now held by
the Faculty Senate, Brettell said.
The slate had no housing proposals,
although Hausknecht said he was
"concerned about the burst of new
theme houses. 1 find it positively dis
quieting."
Housing
He also said he did not like the cur
rent guaranteed housing system, but

said "as lons as on-campus housing is
in short supply, we'll have to put up
with something like this."
Docters charged chemistry depart
ment professors with violating the
Honor Code by proctoring exams. "If I
didn't have better things to do," he
said, "I'd send them letter bombs."
Although Docters worked for the
Chaparral last year, he said his slate
has no connection with the Hammer
and Coffin Society, a collection of
Chaparral staffers.
"I thought Hammer and Coffin was
the most interesting change in student
government in a long time," Berz said.
"And they did come up with some
good proposals. 1 don't mean that we
should be perpetually joking and ban
tering, however."

quarter, led by ASSU Vice President
Carole Houck, recommended such a
change.
'Less power'
Having four co-presidents would -
"give less power to the one president."
Brettell said.
Slate members differed on whether
the COP should be salaried. "I would
do the job probably for nothing." Doc
ters said. But Hausknecht and Brettell
said salaries should be retained so
quality candidates would run for the
offices.
Hausknecht expressed concern that
the COP usually "raises its head dur
ing election time and then sinks back
into the murk. If candidates win, we
never see them again."
Slate members said they would re
main in close contact with students, if


Rob Docters, Lary Berz, Peter Hausknecht, Leslie Bretell
elected. Hausknecht contended that
all of this year's slates, including his,
were making some promises that were
"hogwash. Pragmatically," he said,
"making one or two changes is all we
can expect."
The ASSU, including the COP, will
not be able to assume much of the
decision-making power now held by
the Faculty Senate, Brettell said.
The slate had no housing proposals,
although Hausknecht said he was
"concerned about the burst of new
theme houses. 1 find it positively dis
quieting."
Housing
He also said he did not like the cur
rent guaranteed housing system, but

said "as lons as on-campus housing is
in short supply, we'll have to put up
with something like this."
Docters charged chemistry depart
ment professors with violating the
Honor Code by proctoring exams. "If I
didn't have better things to do," he
said, "I'd send them letter bombs."
Although Docters worked for the
Chaparral last year, he said his slate
has no connection with the Hammer
and Coffin Society, a collection of
Chaparral staffers.
"I thought Hammer and Coffin was
the most interesting change in student
government in a long time," Berz said.
"And they did come up with some
good proposals. 1 don't mean that we
should be perpetually joking and ban
tering, however."
"I think money is being squandered
here," charged Rob Docters, a candi
date for the ASSU Council of Presi
dents (COP). "If the University
adopted modern—and I don't mean
1910—management techniques, it
could save a lot of money."
Docters is running for the COP with*
Leslie Brettell, Lary Berz and Peter
Hausknecht on a platform that in
cludes several reduced spending

planks.
Slate members say they will use
jcommittee channels to pressure the
University to reduce costs, and will
seek to reduce ASSU costs.
Docters referred to an excess amount
of secretarial work in both the Univer
sity and ASSU. He said he knew of no
other instances of money being squan
dered. but said he was sure studies
would reveal more cases.
Hausknecht stresses his slate seeks

no "blanket zapping of programs," but
would instead examine programs
case-by-case.
Little publicity
The slate has done little publicity
work so far. "We're not fanatical, we're
not busting down doors."
Berz estimated the slate's chance of
being elected at five per cent.
Hausknecht and Brettell saw their
chances as about one-third, though.
None of the slate members have been
in student government. "Naivete can
be an advantage," though, Berz said.
"It gives us more of a fresh approach."
Brettell said she favored having four
ASSU co-presidents, rather than one
president and three vice presidents, as
is now the case. A SWOPSI course last
quarter, led by ASSU Vice President
Carole Houck, recommended such a
change.
