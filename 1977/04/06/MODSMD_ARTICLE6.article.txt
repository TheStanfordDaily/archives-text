# Alben slate runs for fun of it
## 
### Ann Amioka 
Putting carp in deGuerre pool,
reinstituting the 'F' and bringing in
capital punishment for Honor Code
violators—these are among the prop
osals of the "Heffalump and Woozle"
slate for ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP).
The all-freshman slate, headed by
Alex Alben, is running "for the fun of
it," Alben said. His running mates are
Carl Danner, Rob Holbrook and Ron
Marryott.
The group's reason for choosing the
name "Heffalump and Woozle" is
"pretty self-evident, really," accord
ing to Holbrook. "It means different
things to different people, which is the
important thing."
In an interview Monday evening.
Holbrook and Alben objected to hav
ing slate members identified as
freshmen, saying such identification
would be discriminatory because stu
dents tend to think less highly of
freshmen than upperclassmen.
Revealing one's race
Listing one's class standing, said
Holbrook, "is like putting race on an
application."
Slate members identify themselves
as: Alben, undecided; Danner, unde
termined; Holbrook, dubious; and
Marryott, vacillating.
Alben has "previous experience,"
Danner has "some previous experi
ence," Holbrook has "no previous ex
perience" and Marryott has "abso
lutely none," according to Alben and
Holbrook.
Marryott disagreed with this as

sessment of his background, saying he
thought he had some experience.
Besides, "I don't know these guys,"
Marryott said, referring to the rest of
the Huffalump and Woozle slate. "If
nominated I will not run,"he said. "If
elected, I will only collect the salary."
'Fetal pig'
Alben and Holbrook said their slate
is in favor of making the "fetal pig" the
school mascot, with "fetal pink" be
coming the school color. They also

s'aid their slate supports instituting
capital punishment for Honor Code
Violators.
Current penalties for Honor Code
violations "are not strict enough," said
Holbrook.
In a platform statement submitted to
the Daily opinions page, however, the
slate stated that it opposed both these
measures.
The apparent contradiction between


Alex Alben, Carl Danner, Rob Horbrook, Ron Marryott
the two stands is due to a "temporal
relationship," said Alben. He noted
that the platform statement had been
written earlier Monday, and slate
members had "one set of mind then
and one set of mind now."
Carp in deGuerre?
Filling deGuerre pool with carp
would "reflect the ecological move
ment" and prevent "expensive, ineffi
cient waste of energy" by providing a
more efficient filtration system than
the current one, said Holbrook. •
"It's clean, efficient and only
slightly repulsive," he said.
Reinstituting the 'F' is the slate's
solution to grade inflation. According
to Alben, if the 'F' is reinstituted and
allowed to appear on transcripts while
'A's and -B's are eliminated, graduate

schools "will know what a 'C
means...a C-plus average would be re
ally meaningful."
After a few years, when the Univer
sity has developed a reputation for
hard grading, said Holbrook, 'A's and
'B's could be reinstated.
Some people may think members of
the Heffalump and Woozle slate are
not serious, said Alben, but "1 can only
stress that we are."
Other slates are offering "tired solu
tions" to old problems, he said.
"There's no imagination or creativity
left."
Noting that slate members "did get
100 sane human beings to sign our pet
ition," Alben predicted the slate
would capture no more than 40 per
cent of the vote on the first ballot.
Nevertheless, said Holbrook, "We
are the next Council of Presidents."

Alex Alben, is running "for the fun of
it," Alben said. His running mates are
Carl Danner, Rob Holbrook and Ron
Marryott.
The group's reason for choosing the
name "Heffalump and Woozle" is
"pretty self-evident, really," accord
ing to Holbrook. "It means different
things to different people, which is the
important thing."
In an interview Monday evening.
Holbrook and Alben objected to hav
ing slate members identified as
freshmen, saying such identification
would be discriminatory because stu
dents tend to think less highly of
freshmen than upperclassmen.
Revealing one's race
Listing one's class standing, said
Holbrook, "is like putting race on an
application."
Slate members identify themselves
as: Alben, undecided; Danner, unde
termined; Holbrook, dubious; and
Marryott, vacillating.
Alben has "previous experience,"
Danner has "some previous experi
ence," Holbrook has "no previous ex
perience" and Marryott has "abso
lutely none," according to Alben and
Holbrook.
Marryott disagreed with this as

sessment of his background, saying he
thought he had some experience.
Besides, "I don't know these guys,"
Marryott said, referring to the rest of
the Huffalump and Woozle slate. "If
nominated I will not run,"he said. "If
elected, I will only collect the salary."
'Fetal pig'
Alben and Holbrook said their slate
is in favor of making the "fetal pig" the
school mascot, with "fetal pink" be
coming the school color. They also

s'aid their slate supports instituting
capital punishment for Honor Code
Violators.
Current penalties for Honor Code
violations "are not strict enough," said
Holbrook.
In a platform statement submitted to
the Daily opinions page, however, the
slate stated that it opposed both these
measures.
The apparent contradiction between


Alex Alben, Carl Danner, Rob Horbrook, Ron Marryott
the two stands is due to a "temporal
relationship," said Alben. He noted
that the platform statement had been
written earlier Monday, and slate
members had "one set of mind then
and one set of mind now."
Carp in deGuerre?
Filling deGuerre pool with carp
would "reflect the ecological move
ment" and prevent "expensive, ineffi
cient waste of energy" by providing a
more efficient filtration system than
the current one, said Holbrook. •
"It's clean, efficient and only
slightly repulsive," he said.
Reinstituting the 'F' is the slate's
solution to grade inflation. According
to Alben, if the 'F' is reinstituted and
allowed to appear on transcripts while
'A's and -B's are eliminated, graduate

schools "will know what a 'C
means...a C-plus average would be re
ally meaningful."
After a few years, when the Univer
sity has developed a reputation for
hard grading, said Holbrook, 'A's and
'B's could be reinstated.
Some people may think members of
the Heffalump and Woozle slate are
not serious, said Alben, but "1 can only
stress that we are."
Other slates are offering "tired solu
tions" to old problems, he said.
"There's no imagination or creativity
left."
Noting that slate members "did get
100 sane human beings to sign our pet
ition," Alben predicted the slate
would capture no more than 40 per
cent of the vote on the first ballot.
Nevertheless, said Holbrook, "We
are the next Council of Presidents."
Putting carp in deGuerre pool,
reinstituting the 'F' and bringing in
capital punishment for Honor Code
violators—these are among the prop
osals of the "Heffalump and Woozle"
slate for ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP).

Alex Alben, is running "for the fun of
