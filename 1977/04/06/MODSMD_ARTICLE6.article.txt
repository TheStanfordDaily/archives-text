# Alben slate runs for fun of it

Putting carp in deGuerre pool,
reinstituting the 'F' and bringing in
capital punishment for Honor Code
violatorsâ€”these are among the prop
osals of the "Heffalump and Woozle"
slate for ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP).
The all-freshman slate, headed by
Alex Alben, is running "for the fun of
it," Alben said. His running mates are
Carl Danner, Rob Holbrook and Ron
Marryott.
The group's reason for choosing the
name "Heffalump and Woozle" is
"pretty self-evident, really," accord
ing to Holbrook. "It means different
things to different people, which is the
important thing."
In an interview Monday evening.
Holbrook and Alben objected to hav
ing slate members identified as
freshmen, saying such identification
would be discriminatory because stu
dents tend to think less highly of
freshmen than upperclassmen.
Revealing one's race
Listing one's class standing, said
Holbrook, "is like putting race on an
application."
Slate members identify themselves
as: Alben, undecided; Danner, unde
termined; Holbrook, dubious; and
Marryott, vacillating.
Alben has "previous experience,"
Danner has "some previous experi
ence," Holbrook has "no previous ex
perience" and Marryott has "abso
lutely none," according to Alben and
Holbrook.
Marryott disagreed with this as

sessment of his background, saying he
thought he had some experience.
Besides, "I don't know these guys,"
Marryott said, referring to the rest of
the Huffalump and Woozle slate. "If
nominated I will not run,"he said. "If
elected, I will only collect the salary."
'Fetal pig'
Alben and Holbrook said their slate
is in favor of making the "fetal pig" the
school mascot, with "fetal pink" be
coming the school color. They also

s'aid their slate supports instituting
capital punishment for Honor Code
Violators.
Current penalties for Honor Code
violations "are not strict enough," said
Holbrook.
In a platform statement submitted to
the Daily opinions page, however, the
slate stated that it opposed both these
measures.
