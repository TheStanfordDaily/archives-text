We are quite embarassed (sic) for
you. Your caption under the front
page photograph, entitled "Rays of
March" (Daily, March 31), reeks of in
excusable sexism. We cannot tolerate
it.

Claims unfounded
1 want to clear up a couple of inac
curacies in John Paval's column
(l)aily, Mar. 30).
First, the suspension of the rules and
the election of a new senate chairman
had nothing to do with the bylaws
amendment on COP salaries.
Second, the appointment of tempor
ary members has no effect on the valid
ity of the passage of the amendment,
because there is no requirement that
such legislation passes through com

mittees. Even if the committee had not
met, the amendment would still have
come before the senate at the same
meeting, and doubtlessly would have
passed by the same margin.
Third, Brad krevoy, as the senate
chairman, appointed the temporary
members with the understanding that
it would be up to final senate approval
since he was unsure of his authority.
Unfortunately, neither the constitu
tion nor the bylaws address the ques
tion in any form, so there was no clear
and simple answer on which to base
the immediately necessary decision.
No attempt was made to "cover-up";
on the contrary, my written report to
the senate no'ed the temporary status
of the members in question.
And last, the amendment was not
rammed through. In fact, it was proba
bly the most discussed piece of legisla
tion to pass the senate this year. The
original proposal, which was vetoed,
passed through two committees and
was brought up at the senate meeting

prior to the one at which it was passed.
The revised proposal was brought up
at one meeting, discussed and referred
to the committee, and then passed at
the next senate meeting. The proce
dure was eminently open and fair.

Hargadon OK
Steve Hansch and Don Moonshine
(Daily, Mar. 28) wrote that
CUAFA cannot overcome the subtle
racism of Dean Hargadon. . As a
member of CUAFA for three years now
1 have yet to hear any credible
documented evidence of racism, sub
tle or otherwise, on the part of Dean
Hargadon or his office. Unless Hansch
and Moonshine can produce such evi
dence I shall assume they are simply
lying.
