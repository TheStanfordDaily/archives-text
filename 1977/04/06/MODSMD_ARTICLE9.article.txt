# COP slates present their platforms
## Reorganize ASSU 
### 
Johnson et al

Are you satisfied with student gov
ernment? You can be. We approach
this election on the premise that ASSU
government is no longer responsive to
the people it was designed to serve:
you.
The structure of the ASSU is rusty.
Before we can deal successfully with
improving the quality of under
graduate education and tackling
graduate concerns, we believe the
ASSU needs to be reorganized.
We propose to elect ASSU Senators
according to their campus residence
(making provisions for off-campus
students), and to create an Educational
Policies Committee (EPC) and a Stu
dent Service Committee (SSC) to coor
dinate the efforts of students on Uni
versity committees and to establish
student priorities.
Furthermore, we will form a Student
Information Office (INFO), responsi
ble for improving communications on
several fronts — a student government
handbook, a telephone information
hotline, an ASSU orientation program,
and an ASSU newsletter.
Due to space limitations, here are
just some of our other goals:
—the continuation of this year's
progress on the tenure issue, the
strengthening of departmental associ
ations, and increased support for over
seas study programs.
—expanded student services in
cluding a student-operated used book
store and record coop.
—aggressive support of affirmative
action and Third World concerns.
—a graduate A pp reaching Stanford,

increased graduate financial aid and
academic rights for spouses.
The best gauge of how a slate will
perform in office is to look at what they
have accomplished in the past.
Rodney Johnson, as president of the
Black Student Union, streamlined a
bureaucratic office into an efficient,
well-organized body. While others
were discussing Third World con
cerns, Rodney Johnson founded SCAR
(the Stanford Committee Against Ra
cism), led a SWOFSI workshop on ra
cism, and co-founded the Third World
Report. And as a member of the Nomi
nations Committe, Rodney Johnson
knows the problems of the committee
system.
As Public Affairs Director of KZSU,
Kim Nyegaard has created more public
interest programming (Women's Af
fairs, voz de la Gente, Black Perspec
tives) than any of her predecessors.
Kim Nyegaard also brings new ideas
and approaches to the ASSU, as she
was a senator at LJC-Berkeley. She is
familiar with graduate concerns also,
having spent considerable time with
graduate students and learning about
their problems.
Fran Furtner has worked exten
sively with a variety of volunteer or
ganizatons at Stanford. As co-founder
of the Academic Organizations Board
(AOB), Fran Furtner united graduate
and undergraduate departmental as
sociations and pre-professional groups
into a centralized body where re
sources and information can be bene
ficially shared — laying the
groundwork for increased student

input into tenure, curriculum and im
proved advising.
Brad Krevoy, during his two years in
the ASSU Senate, has fought to repre
sent your interests. He led the fight
against the Western Civilization re
quirement, co-chaired the committee
that persuaded President Lyman to
reconvene the C-15, and organized
the Senate Sherry Hours, sponsored in
dorms around the campus. As co
founder of the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE), and in
structor of two SWOPSI classes, Brad
Krevoy has organized various political
awareness programs orienting the
Stanford community to the important
social issues. And as a member of the
Committee of Undergraduate Studies,
he is familiar with thetenureissueand
the need to give students a greater
voice in their education.
•
We feel we can accomplish more
than the other slates because we each
represent different interests, rather than
one narrow, radical point of view. We
have been successful in solving prob
lems and innovating change in the
past, and we will bring a fresh, activist
approach to improving the quality of
life at Stanford.
