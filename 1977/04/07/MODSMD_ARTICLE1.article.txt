What ever happened to ROTC?
Despite the violent controversies of
1970, ROTC is still alive on campus.
Four freshmen are currently enrol
led in the ROTC program of the Uni
versity of Santa Clara and their class is
held here in the Electronics Research
I,ah (ERL) every Friday at noon, ac
coiding to instructor Capt. Steve
Carlson of the Santa Clara military
science department.
"We have said that for the conveni
ence of Stanford students enrolled in
the program, rooms are available for
instruction," explained Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president of public
affairs, "but they are not Stanford clas
ses since the students don't receive
any academic credit."
The four students attend the weekly
one-hour class on campus in addition
to field activities held at Santa Clara.
This month, they will be participating
in three Orienteering Meets there,
which involve compass and map read
ing. Although this is not a requirement
of the course, the students said they
intend to participate in the activities.
Scholarships
All ROTC students, as part of the
program, are eligible for scholarships
and are commissioned as officers after
graduation. Currently, two of the stu
dents are competing for three-year
ROTC scholarships which would pay
for tuition and textbook fees, and give
the recipient $100 a month.
"So far, it's been what I expected â€”
and yes, 1 intend to continue," said
Cadet Webster Proctor, "scholarship
or not."
"I like the program, I like what we're
doing," Cadet Larry Shank explained.
"If I get the scholarship I'll definitely
continue," he said.
According to Carlson, "The compet
ition is heavy, but both have a good
chance of winning."
Shank said he will continue the
program even if he doesn't get the
scholarship, if the Santa Clara instruc
tors keep coming up here and if stu
dent interest rises.
"As soon as people know we have a
class here, I think the enrollment will
go up," he said.
Graduate student Bob Barker shared
these sentiments. Enrollment will go
up "certainly, since there's a new re
cruitment program being planned
right now," said Barker, who serves as
a liason officer between Stanford stu
dents and Army ROTC.
'Restore ROTC'
According to Barker, he has spurred
the "Restore ROTC" activities on cam
pus since spring 1973.
Will ROTC return to campus?
"It depends on how many students
join the present program with courses
being taught here on campus," said
Barker.
Assoc. History Prof. Lyman Van-
Slvke, a member of the 1970 presiden
tial advisory committee which made
recommendations for the program's
phase-out, said he "would find it dif
ficult to object to its return to campus
as a non-credit voluntary activity," but
would not recommend its return.
Rosenzweig said a return of ROTC to
campus is "not likelv to haopen in the
foreseeable future."
