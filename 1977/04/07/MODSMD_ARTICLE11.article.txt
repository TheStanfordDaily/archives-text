# Racism enjoying popular resurgence
## 
### 
The Sunset district is never pictured
on souvenir postcards of San Fran
cisco. It lacks the distinctive features
that typify the City â€” steep hills, cahle
cars, quaint shops.
The Sunset is a quiet neighborhood,
with broad, clean avenues, stucco row
houses and small, fenced-in back
yards. On a weekday afternoon, one
can walk for blocks without seeing a
passing car or another pedestrian.
The Sunset is the closest thing to a
"bedroom community" that an urban
center like San Francisco has to offer.
It's an area of the lower-middle and
middle-middle classes. People move
there to raise their children, or to es
cape the congestion and crime that,
while not entirely unknown to the dis
trict, at least seem less severe there
than in other areas of the city. Perhaps
because it is quiet, clean and refreshed
by zesty ocean air, people view the
Sunset as an area of safety, a place
where they can find peace of mind
without a commute.
And perhaps this is one reason why
a number of Jewish survivors of Ger
man concentration camps made their
homes in the district. But the peace of
mind they sought and found there was
rudely disturbed last week by the
opening of a Nazi bookstore directly
across the street from the B'nai
Emunah Temple, founded by
German-Jewish refugees after World
War 11.
As the newspapers have reported,
the Rudolph Hess bookstore, which

proudly flaunted a giant swastika on
its window, was attacked by a number
of Sunset residents five days after it
opened. Enraged by the swastika and
all it represented, the group converged
on the store with rocks and
sledgehammers.
Vandalism
Retaliation for the attack came
swiftly after midnight. The windows
of the synagogue, each pane of which
had been donated in memory of a rela
tive lost to the Nazis in the war, were
shattered by rocks thrown by uniden
tified vandals.
The desecration prompted another
attack on the bookstore, during which
the attackers started a fire which de
stroyed most of the "literature" the
store offered for sale.
There will be those who will con
demn the mob action against the
'bookstore for two reasons. The first is
that most of us believe that mob vio
lence can never be condoned, no mat
ter what the cause. The second reason
is that the First Amendment constitu
tional rights of the Nazis were flag
rantly violated. Whether we like it or
not, the right of free speech is guaran
teed to all Americans, Nazis included.
But one must wonder at the Nazi
Party's motivation in setting up a
bookstore across the street from a
synagogue, especially since the
synagogue has among its congregation
so many survivors of Nazi atrocities. Is
it possible that the Nazis were ignorant

of the provocation their presence
created?
Not unaware
This can hardly be the case.
People who openly idolize and prom
ote the ideology of sadistic war crimi
nals and genocidal butchers cannot be
unaware of the effect their position
will have on those who barely escaped
with their lives from these same
"heroes."

Why would the Nazi Party seek out a
quiet, residential district like the Sun
set as a location for its bookstore?
Other neighborhoods offer greater
human congestion and more potential
customers for Mein Kampf and other
Nazi literature.
The answer lies in the exact location
of the sore, in its direct proximity with
the synagogue. The site was not a ran
dom choice. It seems to have been
made with deliberate provocation of
the district's Jewish residents in mind.
It was selected not as an ideal place for
a bookstore of its kind, but with the
intention of arousing a violent inci
dent.
The Nazis have been very clever.
They baited a trap, and the citizens
who stormed the bookstore fell right
into it. Infuriated by memories of,their
own suffering and the losses of loved
ones to the Nazis during the war. these
residents were provoked into mob ac
tion. They were provoked into violat
ing the Nazis's constitutional rights.
And now the Nazis are exultantly
pointing accusing fingers at the mob
members, while relying on the know
ledge that even American liberals who
despise fascism will condemn mob
violence and persecution.
'Oppressed' minority
The Nazi plan is to engineer for
themselves the role of oppressed
minority, for they know that oppressed
minorities have sympathy (of sorts) in
this country. And now that we have
whites, such as the would-be medical
student Bakke, casting themselves as
victims of "reverse discrimination,"

the Nazis will he able to appeal to an
even wider audience, whites who see
themselves as "oppressed" by
minorities.
Most whites don't like affirmative
action. They see it as a forced loss of
something (education, employment,
etc.) which they feel by rights should
be theirs. Couple racism with a false
sense of victimization, and a situation
is created in which Nazi ideology can
flourish.
How far is the distance between
theoretical ideology and ideology in
action? Judging from the past ac
tivities of the Ku Klux Klan, which is
not too different from the Nazi party in
its hatred of minorities, we can see that
the gap between theory and practice is
easily bridged.
.Political base
Right now, the Nazis are laying
down a foundation for further action.
The incident in the normally peaceful
Sunset district shows that the Nazi
Party intends to appeal to our rever
ence for individual freedoms in order
to build a political base of sympathy
with their cause. While the liberals
among us are held at bay by awe for
constitutional rights, the Nazis buy
time to gain the attention and support
of the racists and fascists among us.
We like to look at the atrocities
committed in other countries and then
smugly reassure ourselves that, "It
couldn't happen here." Couldn't it?
The Ku Klux Klan is a distinctively
American organization which histo
rians believe caused more than 4000
deaths of American citizens.
The concentration camp is no
stranger to this country. Thousands of
Japanese American citizens were con
fined in camps during World War 11.
Racism has never vanished from the
American scene, and as the success
rate of "reverse discrimination" court
cases indicates, racism is enjoying a
popular resurgence.
The hatred of one mi nority paves the
way for the hatred of another. America
is not exempt from anti-Semitism. It
still exists here, and can become more
virulent, given the opportunity; which
is exactly what the Nazis were trying to
provide by their provocative presence
across from the synagogue.
If the Nazis continue to cleverly bait
Jews as they did with their bookstore,
anti-Spmitism will no doubt begin to
gain "respectability" and currency
among many Americans.
