Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig strikes a blow for
apathy in his column (Daily, April 1).
His smug dismissal of Steven Hansch
and Don Moonshine's exhortation to
community action (Daily, March 28fas
naive revolutionary rhetoric succeeds
only in baring his own hopelessly nar
row ideology.
What is more, he extends his con
demnation to all revolutionary activ
ity, and implies that mass movements
which seek to effect social change may
be likened to rites of spring, commen
surate with maypoles, dorm parties,
and beer softball.
Hansch and Moonshine assert that
"Stanford University . . . cannot even
recognize, admit and deal with its own
history of minority repression."
Rosenzweig inadvertantly lends cre
dence to their claim; whilealleging his
own moral superiority (on the basis of
his highly-evolved sense of humor), he
ignores the questions raised by Hansch
and Moonshine.
It is no wonder that Stanford's
minority students sense an air of rep
ression, when administrators at the
vice-presidential level view thought
ful complaints merely as fodder for
witty essays.

Of course, Rosenzweig seeks to in
form as well as entertain. He suggests
that social movements are mere
emptyheaded games, that political ac
tivism is necessarily accompanied by
violence, and that the choice of target
is a simple matter of convenience.
But to deny others the sincerity of
their convictions is a most repulsive
form of elitism; to infer a penchant for
violence where none was expressed is
needlessly cynical; and the notion that
Hansch and Moonshine are mindless
revolutionaries searching day and
night for something to rebel against is
preposterous.
The issues confronted by Hansch
and Moonshine are not all equally
sound, but they deserve examination.
The tragedy of Rosenzweig's position
is that he is either unable or unwilling
to give any consideration to their
ideas.
Hansch and Moonshine suggest that
an internationally respected univer
sity ought to be an example of social as
well as intellectual enlightenment;
their expectations are overly optimis
tic as long as the university is operated
by people incapable of mature critical
thought.
