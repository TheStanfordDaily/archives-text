# Introducing Duca
## 
### 
He was horn in Bucharest,
Romania in 1905, the son of a
leader of the nation's Liberal
party and the Princess
Alexandrine Morusi. A career
diplomat, he was twice at
tached to the Rumanian em
bassy in Washington, D.C.,
between postings in Rio de
Janeiro and Tokyo. Now he
does research and teaches at
the Hoover Institute.
And today we welcome
him as a regular Daily colum
nist.
His name is George Duca
and he likes young people. So
much so, in fact, that he wants
to devote his column to help
ing them cope with the prob
lems that crop up here.
Duca's been around. Two
years ago he left New York
Gitv to come to the I loover In
stitute. I le was 70 years old at
the time. Duca took the job
here because he was editing

his father's papers (which
had been given to Hoover)
and because it brought him
closer to the young.
Since then he has taught a
number of seminars, con
ducted an Undergraduate
Special and is an adviser for
incoming freshmen. The
questions he answers in his
first column are from stu
dents who were enrolled in
his last seminar.
His credentials are impres
sive. He got his M.A. and L.L.D.
at the University of Bucharest
and then entered the Roma
nian diplomatic corps.
While he was away from
his native land, Duca's father
— Jean Duca — was named
prime minister of Rumania
but was assassinated in 19H;J
because "his government had
tried to defend democratic in
stitutions against the rise of
fascism."

During World War 11, Duca
was charge d'affaires in Fin
land. He was involved in sec
ret negotiations which ulti
mately lead to Rumania s
military alliance with the Al
lies against Germany.
Duca emigrated to the Un
ited States after the com
munist takeover of Rumania
and became an American
citizen in 1954 and has been
active for the past 10 years
with relief work as secretary
of the Rumanian welfare
agency in New York.
Questions for Duca should
be sent to Dear Duca, care of
the Stanford Daily, Storke
Publications Building. His
column will be appearing
each Thursday.

Dear Duca: lam a fresh ma n
and live in a co-ed dormitory.
I have never been in a co-ed
living situation before.

Living in East-Oasis, Kan.,
population 47, where the elig
ible males in the town are
either relatives or farm
hands, and having gone to an
all-female hoarding school
100 miles from home, I've
never been exposed to such
risque und generally loose
moral attitudes in my life.
Should I he shocked when a
boy wears his boxer shorts
down the hull? Or brushes his
teeth in the water fountain?
Should I be upset at loud
dirty jokes, or food fights, or
belching, or toe picking? Is
this normal? Am I abnormal?
-Polly Anna
Dear Folly Ai.na: As long
as co-ed living has been ac
cepted as a fact of campus life,
you must accept it humor
ously, if with a dash of exasp
eration sometimes.
Don't be shocked, be
amused, ignore, don't protest
and, if it reaches some days a
degree of unexpected you
know-what, do not get angry
— look the other way.
Naturally life in common is

not always very pretty, thus
sail through it detachedly,
whistling your favorite tune!
If any,

Dear Duca: I am a senior
graduating in June, Like
many other seniors, I don't
really know what I want to do
next year.
People always talk about
all the options we graduating
students have. But all of these
"options," like the many dif
ferent colors of the spectrum,
seem to merge into a diffuse,
nebulous white.
The more I've tried to dis
cern what I want to do, the
more frustrated I've become.
What do you suggest I do?
How, in any case might you
suggest I approach next year?
-Bottom of the Ninth
Dear Bottom of the Ninth: If
you have not made your
choice yet on the eve of your
graduation day, take time out
for a serious, thorough con
centration process: what is
your major? What are your
options? What is it that you

really want to do within the
framework of your pos
sibilities?
Proceed by elimination
until you reach — say — two
or three of these possibilities,
then start all over again —
calmly, rationally.
Should this "system" not
produce the hoped-for re
sults, take a few months vaca
tion, or grab just any tempor
ary job which comes your
way. You'll be surprised how
unexpectedly you will find
the right solution.

Dear Duca: I am a senior
majoring in chemical en
gineering. Now as I prepare
for my college graduation, 1
am beginning to realize that
though I can synthetize,
analyze, organize and am ex
tremely adept with a cen
trifuge, I have no liberal arts
background. In short, I feel
rather narrow.
1 am not a very good writer,
I can't remember the lust time
I read a novel, and I suppose I
am as socially communica

tive as magnesium is tasty. I
feel us though I've gotten an
education at the expense of
my education. I don't know if
I need consultation or a
shrink.
I don't know even why I'm
writing this, except, perhaps,
to get all this off my shoul
ders. Any advice?
-C4H2E M.'t
Dear C4HUKM3: Indeed,
there is nothing like a well
rounded education. No, you
did certainly not get "an edu
cation at the EXPENSE of
(your) education," for you
should already be well pre
pared fora profitable careeras
a chemical engineer.
My advice would be to take
some liberal art courses dur
ing the summer months, see
which subjects interest you
most, then pursue them in
your own free time. Like an
unexpected hobby, you will
be astonished what new
tastes and knowledge will
come your way — astonished
and gratified!

-C4H2E M.'t
Dear C4HUKM3: Indeed,
there is nothing like a well
rounded education. No, you
did certainly not get "an edu
cation at the EXPENSE of
(your) education," for you
should already be well pre
pared fora profitable careeras
a chemical engineer.
My advice would be to take
some liberal art courses dur
ing the summer months, see
which subjects interest you
most, then pursue them in
your own free time. Like an
unexpected hobby, you will
be astonished what new
tastes and knowledge will
come your way — astonished
and gratified!

He was horn in Bucharest,
Romania in 1905, the son of a
leader of the nation's Liberal
party and the Princess
Alexandrine Morusi. A career
diplomat, he was twice at
tached to the Rumanian em
bassy in Washington, D.C.,
between postings in Rio de
Janeiro and Tokyo. Now he
does research and teaches at
the Hoover Institute.
And today we welcome
him as a regular Daily colum
nist.
His name is George Duca
and he likes young people. So
much so, in fact, that he wants
to devote his column to help
ing them cope with the prob
lems that crop up here.
Duca's been around. Two
years ago he left New York
Gitv to come to the I loover In
stitute. I le was 70 years old at
the time. Duca took the job
here because he was editing

his father's papers (which
had been given to Hoover)
and because it brought him
closer to the young.
Since then he has taught a
number of seminars, con
ducted an Undergraduate
Special and is an adviser for
incoming freshmen. The
questions he answers in his
first column are from stu
dents who were enrolled in
his last seminar.
His credentials are impres
sive. He got his M.A. and L.L.D.
at the University of Bucharest
and then entered the Roma
nian diplomatic corps.
While he was away from
his native land, Duca's father
— Jean Duca — was named
prime minister of Rumania
but was assassinated in 19H;J
because "his government had
tried to defend democratic in
stitutions against the rise of
fascism."

During World War 11, Duca
was charge d'affaires in Fin
land. He was involved in sec
ret negotiations which ulti
mately lead to Rumania s
military alliance with the Al
lies against Germany.
Duca emigrated to the Un
ited States after the com
munist takeover of Rumania
and became an American
citizen in 1954 and has been
active for the past 10 years
with relief work as secretary
of the Rumanian welfare
agency in New York.
Questions for Duca should
be sent to Dear Duca, care of
the Stanford Daily, Storke
Publications Building. His
column will be appearing
each Thursday.

Dear Duca: lam a fresh ma n
and live in a co-ed dormitory.
I have never been in a co-ed
living situation before.

Living in East-Oasis, Kan.,
population 47, where the elig
ible males in the town are
either relatives or farm
hands, and having gone to an
all-female hoarding school
100 miles from home, I've
never been exposed to such
risque und generally loose
moral attitudes in my life.
Should I he shocked when a
boy wears his boxer shorts
down the hull? Or brushes his
teeth in the water fountain?
Should I be upset at loud
dirty jokes, or food fights, or
belching, or toe picking? Is
this normal? Am I abnormal?
-Polly Anna
Dear Folly Ai.na: As long
as co-ed living has been ac
cepted as a fact of campus life,
you must accept it humor
ously, if with a dash of exasp
eration sometimes.
Don't be shocked, be
amused, ignore, don't protest
and, if it reaches some days a
degree of unexpected you
know-what, do not get angry
— look the other way.
Naturally life in common is

not always very pretty, thus
sail through it detachedly,
whistling your favorite tune!

Dear Duca: I am a senior
graduating in June, Like
many other seniors, I don't
really know what I want to do
next year.
People always talk about
all the options we graduating
students have. But all of these
"options," like the many dif
ferent colors of the spectrum,
seem to merge into a diffuse,
nebulous white.
The more I've tried to dis
cern what I want to do, the
more frustrated I've become.
What do you suggest I do?
How, in any case might you
suggest I approach next year?
-Bottom of the Ninth
Dear Bottom of the Ninth: If
you have not made your

graduation day, take time out
for a serious, thorough con

your major? What are your
options? What is it that you

really want to do within the
framework of your pos
sibilities?
Proceed by elimination
until you reach — say — two
or three of these possibilities,
then start all over again —
calmly, rationally.
Should this "system" not
produce the hoped-for re
sults, take a few months vaca
tion, or grab just any tempor
ary job which comes your
way. You'll be surprised how
unexpectedly you will find
the right solution.

graduation day, take time out
for a serious, thorough con
centration process: what is
your major? What are your
options? What is it that you

really want to do within the
framework of your pos
sibilities?
Proceed by elimination
until you reach — say — two
or three of these possibilities,
then start all over again —
calmly, rationally.
Should this "system" not

Dear Duca: I am a senior
majoring in chemical en
gineering. Now as I prepare
for my college graduation, 1
am beginning to realize that
though I can synthetize,
analyze, organize and am ex
tremely adept with a cen
trifuge, I have no liberal arts
background. In short, I feel
rather narrow.
1 am not a very good writer,
I can't remember the lust time
I read a novel, and I suppose I
am as socially communica

tive as magnesium is tasty. I
feel us though I've gotten an
education at the expense of
my education. I don't know if
I need consultation or a
shrink.
I don't know even why I'm
writing this, except, perhaps,
to get all this off my shoul
ders. Any advice?
-C4H2E M.'t
Dear C4HUKM3: Indeed,
there is nothing like a well
rounded education. No, you
did certainly not get "an edu
cation at the EXPENSE of
(your) education," for you
should already be well pre
pared fora profitable careeras
a chemical engineer.
My advice would be to take
some liberal art courses dur
ing the summer months, see
which subjects interest you
most, then pursue them in
your own free time. Like an
unexpected hobby, you will
be astonished what new
tastes and knowledge will
come your way — astonished
and gratified!

He was horn in Bucharest,
Romania in 1905, the son of a
leader of the nation's Liberal
party and the Princess
Alexandrine Morusi. A career
diplomat, he was twice at
tached to the Rumanian em
bassy in Washington, D.C.,
between postings in Rio de
Janeiro and Tokyo. Now he
does research and teaches at
the Hoover Institute.
And today we welcome
him as a regular Daily colum
nist.
His name is George Duca
and he likes young people. So
much so, in fact, that he wants
to devote his column to help
ing them cope with the prob
lems that crop up here.
Duca's been around. Two
years ago he left New York
Gitv to come to the I loover In
stitute. I le was 70 years old at
the time. Duca took the job
here because he was editing

his father's papers (which
had been given to Hoover)
and because it brought him
closer to the young.
Since then he has taught a
number of seminars, con
ducted an Undergraduate
Special and is an adviser for
incoming freshmen. The
questions he answers in his
first column are from stu
dents who were enrolled in
his last seminar.
His credentials are impres
sive. He got his M.A. and L.L.D.
at the University of Bucharest
and then entered the Roma
nian diplomatic corps.
While he was away from
his native land, Duca's father
— Jean Duca — was named
prime minister of Rumania
but was assassinated in 19H;J
because "his government had
tried to defend democratic in
stitutions against the rise of
fascism."

During World War 11, Duca
was charge d'affaires in Fin
land. He was involved in sec
ret negotiations which ulti
mately lead to Rumania s
military alliance with the Al
lies against Germany.
Duca emigrated to the Un
ited States after the com
munist takeover of Rumania
and became an American
citizen in 1954 and has been
active for the past 10 years
with relief work as secretary
of the Rumanian welfare
agency in New York.
Questions for Duca should
be sent to Dear Duca, care of
the Stanford Daily, Storke
Publications Building. His
column will be appearing
each Thursday.

Dear Duca: lam a fresh ma n
and live in a co-ed dormitory.
I have never been in a co-ed
living situation before.

Living in East-Oasis, Kan.,
population 47, where the elig
ible males in the town are
either relatives or farm
hands, and having gone to an
all-female hoarding school
100 miles from home, I've
never been exposed to such
risque und generally loose
moral attitudes in my life.
Should I he shocked when a
boy wears his boxer shorts
down the hull? Or brushes his
teeth in the water fountain?
Should I be upset at loud
dirty jokes, or food fights, or
belching, or toe picking? Is
this normal? Am I abnormal?
-Polly Anna
Dear Folly Ai.na: As long
as co-ed living has been ac
cepted as a fact of campus life,
you must accept it humor
ously, if with a dash of exasp
eration sometimes.
Don't be shocked, be
amused, ignore, don't protest
and, if it reaches some days a
degree of unexpected you
know-what, do not get angry
— look the other way.
Naturally life in common is

not always very pretty, thus
sail through it detachedly,
whistling your favorite tune!

Dear Duca: I am a senior
graduating in June, Like
many other seniors, I don't
really know what I want to do
next year.
People always talk about
all the options we graduating
students have. But all of these
"options," like the many dif
ferent colors of the spectrum,
seem to merge into a diffuse,
nebulous white.
The more I've tried to dis
cern what I want to do, the
more frustrated I've become.
What do you suggest I do?
How, in any case might you
suggest I approach next year?
