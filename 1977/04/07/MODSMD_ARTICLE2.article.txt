# University investment
## Forum explains policies 
### Jim Tranquada 
University stock holdings "should
ordinarily be disposed of" if they bring
about a confict between the Universi
ty's prudent investor duty and the
moral sense of the community it
serves, said Law School Prof. Howard
Williams last night.
"One duty may not be subordinated
to another," Williams said at a forum
on investment responsibility. "If the
two conflict, the investment should
not be continued."
This policy applies in all but excep
tional cases when, because of restric
tions on the stock, disposal is not feas
ible, he said.
"I am left with the impression that
there is very little room for corporate
and social responsibility here — it is
rarely considered and never acted
upon," said Jill Nelson, student
member of the Committee for Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR).
"These are left to be raised by stu
dents and other members of the com
munity," she said.
Complex issues
Ceorge Bach, professor of
economics and a CIR member, em
phasized that when the CIR promul
gated its Statement on Investment Re
sponsibility, it was "enormously im
pressed with the complexity of issues"
it was presented with. He read por
tions of the statement, which recog
nizes that maximizing financial return
"will be the dominating factor" in in
vestment policy.
'It's as imperfect as anything can be,
but it (University policy) is better than
nothing," said Robert Augsburger,

vice president for business and fi
nance.
The University's rejection of a 1972
proposal to not knowingly invest in
prime contractors of anti-personnel
weapons "raises questions on the
meaning and values of the ClR's
guidelines." said David Abernethy
associate professor of political science.
"The University is an excellent
place for the application of institu
tional ethics . . . the realm of ought and
should," he said. "Society pays a high
price if institutions pass on responsi
bility to someone else."
Criteria
The Board of Trustees' considera
tion of social and political issues in
investment is dependent on three
main criteria, Bach said:
— Do the activities of the company
have a direct and substantial effect?
— Does a substantial consensus
exist in the University community?
— Is the economic cost to the Uni
versity commensurate to the effective
ness of the action taken?
Much of the evening's presentation
revolved around the difficulty of de
termining or quantitizing any one of
these three criteria.
"The CIR is a powerless show
piece," asserted Nelson. "Its mandate
is very narrow because of the restric
tive guidelines."
Williams stressed that Stanford is a
charitable, non-profit corporation,
subject to legally binding fiduciary
duties.
When dealing with investment pol
icy, he said, the trustees must always
consider their duty to maximization of

income and preservation of the estate
and their duty toward the moral sense
of the community.
Responsibility
Board members can be held indi
vidually responsible for any breach of
their fiduciary duties, Williams said.
Foremost among those who can take
legal action against the board is the
attorney general, as representative of
the people, but "under certain limited
circumstances," the beneficiaries of
the corporation can take action, he
said.


When ROTC was here
Police guard the door to the athletic department following a demonstration
in 1970 against the ROTC program here. At that time the ROTC program
had its offices and classrooms in the building. Tensions seem to have eased
over the years and ROTC has started to use campus facilities again.

Williams last night.
"One duty may not be subordinated
to another," Williams said at a forum
on investment responsibility. "If the
two conflict, the investment should
not be continued."
This policy applies in all but excep
tional cases when, because of restric
tions on the stock, disposal is not feas
ible, he said.
"I am left with the impression that
there is very little room for corporate
and social responsibility here — it is
rarely considered and never acted
upon," said Jill Nelson, student
member of the Committee for Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR).
"These are left to be raised by stu
dents and other members of the com
munity," she said.
Complex issues
Ceorge Bach, professor of
economics and a CIR member, em
phasized that when the CIR promul
gated its Statement on Investment Re
sponsibility, it was "enormously im
pressed with the complexity of issues"
it was presented with. He read por
tions of the statement, which recog
nizes that maximizing financial return
"will be the dominating factor" in in
vestment policy.
'It's as imperfect as anything can be,
but it (University policy) is better than
nothing," said Robert Augsburger,

vice president for business and fi
nance.
The University's rejection of a 1972
proposal to not knowingly invest in
prime contractors of anti-personnel
weapons "raises questions on the
meaning and values of the ClR's
guidelines." said David Abernethy
associate professor of political science.
"The University is an excellent
place for the application of institu
tional ethics . . . the realm of ought and
should," he said. "Society pays a high
price if institutions pass on responsi
bility to someone else."
Criteria
The Board of Trustees' considera
tion of social and political issues in
investment is dependent on three
main criteria, Bach said:
— Do the activities of the company
have a direct and substantial effect?
— Does a substantial consensus
exist in the University community?
— Is the economic cost to the Uni
versity commensurate to the effective
ness of the action taken?
Much of the evening's presentation
revolved around the difficulty of de
termining or quantitizing any one of
these three criteria.
"The CIR is a powerless show
piece," asserted Nelson. "Its mandate
is very narrow because of the restric
tive guidelines."
Williams stressed that Stanford is a
charitable, non-profit corporation,
subject to legally binding fiduciary
duties.
When dealing with investment pol
icy, he said, the trustees must always
consider their duty to maximization of

income and preservation of the estate
and their duty toward the moral sense
of the community.
Responsibility
Board members can be held indi
vidually responsible for any breach of
their fiduciary duties, Williams said.
Foremost among those who can take
legal action against the board is the
attorney general, as representative of
the people, but "under certain limited
circumstances," the beneficiaries of
the corporation can take action, he
said.


When ROTC was here
Police guard the door to the athletic department following a demonstration
in 1970 against the ROTC program here. At that time the ROTC program
had its offices and classrooms in the building. Tensions seem to have eased
over the years and ROTC has started to use campus facilities again.
University stock holdings "should
ordinarily be disposed of" if they bring
about a confict between the Universi
ty's prudent investor duty and the
moral sense of the community it
serves, said Law School Prof. Howard
Williams last night.
