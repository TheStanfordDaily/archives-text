## Lesson unclear in 'Magarida' 
### 
Sick. Funny. Sick. Different.
Sicker. Hilarious. Sicker still.
This describes my reaction to
Roberto Athayde's new play,
Miss Margarida's Way, which
opened Monday at the Marines'
Memorial Theatre in San Fran
cisco.
The play, banned in Athayde's
home country, Brazil, stars ac
tress Michael Learned (of The
Walfons), as a school teacher
with the audience as her class.
The play is a study in opposites.
The teacher, a beautiful,
stylishly dressed woman, vacil
lates between being a kind,
"second mother" to her students
and a raving kook.
The merit of the play lies in
Athayde's parodies on modern
day education. However, he de
tracts from his success by in
dulging in pointless vulgarities.

Athayde seems to derive a per
verse pleasure in having his
teacher utter profanities equaled
only by those of possessed Linda
Blair in The Exorcist.
Schizophrenic
Miss Margarida's behavior is
best described as schizophrenic.
She calmly begins lectures only
to interrupt them with sudden
fits of madness, hurling insults
such as "morons, hoods, fags,
bastards," at her class.
She delights in proving her
power over her students. Logic
and subject matter are twisted to
illustrate whatever she feels in
clined to preach.
While many of her lectures are
too obscene to be entertaining,
some are just warped enough to
be amusing.
In a biology lesson Miss Mar
garida announces, "Each of you
is going to die. I bet you didn't
know that, did you? Miss Mar

garida is going to write it on the
blackboard so you won't forget
it." Athayde's is a sick form of
humor, but one that elicited
much audience laughter.
In the course of a lecture on
life, or "things as they are," Mar
garida removes her blouse.
Why? It isn't clear — perhaps to
emphasize the "naked truth," or
perhaps it's just because she's
been promising to take off her
clothes all along. For whatever
reason, Miss Margarida, clad in
skirt and bra, continues her dis
sertation on life which eventu
ally evolves into a lecture on
verbs,
Parts of speech
"Everything is composed of
verbs and nouns," she explains
calmly, but is promptly side
tracked with one of her sudden
hysterical fits. "Miss Margarida
is the teacher," she shouts. "She
bosses the verbs, tells them what
to do. They're my paragraphs,
my sentences, all mine!"
If Miss Margarida were less
vulgar, the play might be fun
nier. The audience delighted in
hearing some of her obscenities
— faux pas every student knows
his teacher has wanted to utter at
some point. "Do not hesitate to
ask questions," she reminds her
class. "Miss Margarida will
answer all questions regardless

of how stupid they are."
Athayde's technique of trans
forming the audience into Mar
garida's class is powerful. Mar
garida intimidated me as if 1
were really back in the eighth
grade.
1 was amazed at the docility
with which the audience ac
cepted Margarida's abuses. At
one point, she successfully led
the audience in a song despite
(or perhaps because of) her
screaming command to "sing,
you bastards, sing."
Disjointed
Margarida's character is never
totally comprehensible but is
composed of many disjointed
parts which Athayde periodi
cally weaves into his play.
Despite the play's unsatisfy
ing mish-mash of the grossly
funny with the grossly repug
nant, Learned, a former A(TT ac
tress, is excellent in the role. She
depicts Margarida as a fascinat
ing woman, sympathetic despite
her sick behavior. Switching
well out of her former role as
Mrs. Walton, Learned's believa
bility never wavers.
From the moment the play
opens and Learned scrawls
"ASSHOLE," on the blackboard
to "test whether the class can see
the board," Miss Margarida rules
and Walton is no more.
