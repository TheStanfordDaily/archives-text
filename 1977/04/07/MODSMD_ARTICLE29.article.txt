## John Stewart: quest to inspire people 
### 
John Stewart is a song
craftsman, guitarist and singer
whose sensitive vision of
America and its people has
earned him a fiercely loyal fol
lowing and a repufationas one of
today's great folk artists.
Stewart, who appeared at San
Francisco's Boarding House last
week, will soon release the ninth
album (on RSO Records) of his
solo career, His show at the
Boarding House was a
perfectly-paced mix of solo
acoustic ballads and driving
electric folk rock which ended
with several encores. In an inter
view between sets, Stewart
commented on why he feels
people come to see him. "The
only reason I'm up there is point
of view," he said. "That's why
people come to see me or any
body else."
Stewart is a sensitive observer
of people. Many of his songs are
touching portraits of loners and
social outcasts. His songs have a
nostalgic, 19th-century-America
tinge to them, a sepia tone of a
simpler and more human
America whose values, he feels,
have relevance today.
The son of a race-horse trainer,
Stewart was raised in Pomona,
and spent two years at Mt. San
Antonio College ("majoring in
acne") before embarking on a
career as a folk singer in the late
'50s. Brought in to replace de
parting Dave Cuard, Stewart
spent four years in the Kingston
Trio before setting off again on a
solo career in 1966. A Phoenix
concert in 1974, which was re
corded as a two-record set on
RCA. captured the essence of the
exuberant, dramatic style
Stewart has developed over the
years.
Pacing
As a performer, Stewart is very
concerned about his audience.
He works carefully to develop
the impact and timing of his
sho' '.
"Pacing," he says, "is the most
difficult thing about performing.
You never know what mood the
peoplearein. . . When I go to see
someone, 1 like to be knocked on
my ass. Sometimes I can't get to
sleep before four or five in the
morning, there's so much ad
renalin going."
Taken in contrast with many
other performers who appear to
be just going through the mo
tions, Stewart's attitude is re
freshing. He appears to be
genuinely concerned with
people.
Stewart's concern over the
quality and impact of his per
formance is representative of his
greater quest to inspire people,
to fire up his audience's imagi
nation and spirit. "People's im
aginations have gone dry," he
says."I want my songs to be like
old-time radio, so people can
tune in and see pictures."
For Stewart, people are the
backbone of America. He talks a
lot about politics, and about the
state of America, in terms of the
spirit of the people. His close

personal involvement with
Robert F. Kennedy affected him
deeply. The trauma of his ex
perience in the Kennedy cam
paign resulted in the writing of
many songs which express his
deep concern about the future of
America: "People need some
thing to inspire them, a spark.
When John Kennedy said, 'The
torch is passed to a new genera
tion,' for one shining hour the
spirit was fired; people were un
ited. That's what I try to do in
song. If I could fire the spirit — if
l could change people's lives for
one day — I'd feel I'd done it."
Rocky'
The movie Hocky epitomized
for Stewart his songs' characters
and his own goals. Stewart
writes about ordinary people
who are really extraordinary.
"I'm writing about the average
guy who just wants to make it
once, to defy the obstacles.
That's what America is about."
In "Mother Country." Stewart
tells the story of another
"Rocky," a man named E.A.
Stuart. "It's a true story. My

father told it to me. It took place
at the L.A. County Fairgrounds
in Pomona in 1935." E.A. Stuart,
a race-horse owner close to death
and going blind, resolved to
make one last ride on his prize
horse. In concert, Stewart builds
the song to a dramatic climax,
and when he sings,
And they're opening the gates
hack there, and here they
come . . .
And the people cheer
While I sou' grown men break.
right down and cry
And you know, it was just a little
while later
that old E.A. Stuart died,
the audience experiences that
same Rocky-like rush of inspira
tion.
Stewart finds it frustrating
that the American people, with
all their potential, can't find the
spirit to unite. "I love this'coun
try," he says. "There are such
fascinating people here. But you
can really break your heart. You
go to the Lincoln Memorial, and
you see a guy in Bermuda shorts.

black socks and loafers, his in
stamatic dangling and his kid
with the icecream dripping and
the snotty nose. And they enter
this temple and look up at the
statue and say. That s us, that's
America.' And its not!"
Family man
Stewart, nearing 4U, is an ar
ticulate but self-effacing man
whose soft-spokenness is
punctuated with gestures and
witty anecdotes. He has a gift for
impersonation, and a sharp
sense of humor. 1 he father of
three, he often tours with his
second wife, Huffy Ford, who
sings harmonies and an occa
sional solo.
Despite the nostalgic tone of
many of his songs, Stewart read
ily admits he's.in optimist. "You
can only go back in imagina
tion," he says. Several of his
songs reflect this feeling, such as
"You Can't Look Hack," "Never
Going Back," and "Roll Away
the Stone. I'hose songs were
lectures to myself," Stewart
says. He stresses the need to con

tinually set new goals, to build
on the past. In his songs, he says,
he tries to use the past to inspire
people about the present. He
cites the multi-media presenta
tion, "Roots," as an example of
the positive impact a new look at
the past can have. "I never really
knew what slavery was all ab
out," he commented.
As for his future, Stewart
plans to continue recording and
touring. His main goal now, he
says, is to get a chart hit. He
points to Gordon Lightfoot and
John Denver as examples of
songwriters who can strike a ba
lance between chart hits and
less-commercial writing. "I'd
like to do both," says Stewart.
"In order to survive, I have to
take it another step, I have to get
the big hit. There's a lot of ten
sion involved, but I love it." A
hit would match Stewart's criti
cal acclaim with a greater public
recognition, which is much de
served.
Regardless, the "Lonesome
Picker" continues to ride.
