# Carter receives authority for federal reorganization
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter armed himself yesterday
with fresh powers to reorganize the
federal bureaucracy. However, his
budget director cast doubt on whether
Carter can carry out a campaign prom
ise to chop the number of departments
and agencies to 200.
Carter signed a new law giving him
self broad authority to undertake a
reorganization drive, which he termed
"the most consistent commitment" he
had made to the voters during his 1976
campaign.
In a statement for the Oval Office
signing ceremony, Carter said he in
tends to use his reorganization powers
"to make government more respon
sive, efficient and open."
Campaign talk
During the campaign, the president
often talked about reducing 1900 fed
eral departments and agencies to no
more than 200.
Following the signing, Director Bert
Lance of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) told reporters: "I don't
think we ought to say . . . we are going
to cut them to 200."
Lance, who will oversee a four-year
reorganization effort for Carter, argued
it was important to take a searching
look at the bureaucracy before setting

any definite goals for the elimination
of agencies.
"I just don't think we ought to play
the numbers game," said Lance.
Although Carter had said there were
1900 federal agencies of one descrip
tion or another. Lance reported yester
day that OMB has now counted 2018,
and indicated there could be even
more that have not yet been pin
pointed.
Since this figure is higher than the
one Carter used during the campaign,
Lance suggested there ought to be
some flexibility in approaching the
200 figure that candidate Carter had
espoused.
New law
Under the new law, Carter can prop
ose reorganization plans that will take
effect automatically unless rejected by
either the Senate or House within 60
days.
There are limits on his reorganiza
tion powers, however. For example,
the president cannot abolish any
Cabinet department or independent
regulatory agency, nor can he elimi
nate any of their statutory programs or
enforcement functions.
A case in point is the administra
tion's current effort to win congres
sional approval for a new department
of energy through the enactment of
special legislation.
The president announced that his
first reorganization effort under the
new bill will focus on his own shop,
the Executive Office of the President.
An OMB team already at work on this
promises to submit its recommenda
tions by early June.
Lance said the objective will be to
achieve an executive office "smaller
and more responsive to the needs of
the president."
Open process
Carter promised to "give my per
sonal attention and support" to a reor
ganization and said the process "will
be an open one."
The president had sought reorgani
zation authority for four years, but
Congress passed a law expiring in
three years.
While noting this, Carter said the

new reorganization law — the first
since Congress refused to renew such
powers for resigned President Richard
Nixon in 1973 — "does provide some
flexibility that has not been available
to other presidents."
As an example, Carter said he can
withdraw or alter a reorganization
plan within 3D days after its submis
sion. In addition, Congress removed a
previous provision that permitted a
president to submit only one plan
every 30 days.

Although Carter had said there were
1900 federal agencies of one descrip
tion or another. Lance reported yester
day that OMB has now counted 2018,
and indicated there could be even
more that have not yet been pin
pointed.
Since this figure is higher than the
one Carter used during the campaign,
Lance suggested there ought to be
some flexibility in approaching the
200 figure that candidate Carter had
espoused.
New law
Under the new law, Carter can prop
ose reorganization plans that will take
effect automatically unless rejected by
either the Senate or House within 60
days.
There are limits on his reorganiza
tion powers, however. For example,
the president cannot abolish any
Cabinet department or independent
regulatory agency, nor can he elimi
nate any of their statutory programs or
enforcement functions.
A case in point is the administra
tion's current effort to win congres
sional approval for a new department
of energy through the enactment of
special legislation.
The president announced that his
first reorganization effort under the
new bill will focus on his own shop,
the Executive Office of the President.
An OMB team already at work on this
promises to submit its recommenda
tions by early June.
Lance said the objective will be to
achieve an executive office "smaller
and more responsive to the needs of
the president."
Open process
Carter promised to "give my per
sonal attention and support" to a reor
ganization and said the process "will
be an open one."
The president had sought reorgani
zation authority for four years, but
Congress passed a law expiring in
three years.
While noting this, Carter said the

new reorganization law — the first
since Congress refused to renew such
powers for resigned President Richard
Nixon in 1973 — "does provide some
flexibility that has not been available
to other presidents."
As an example, Carter said he can
withdraw or alter a reorganization
plan within 3D days after its submis
sion. In addition, Congress removed a
previous provision that permitted a
president to submit only one plan
every 30 days.
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter armed himself yesterday
with fresh powers to reorganize the
federal bureaucracy. However, his
budget director cast doubt on whether
Carter can carry out a campaign prom
ise to chop the number of departments
and agencies to 200.
Carter signed a new law giving him
self broad authority to undertake a
reorganization drive, which he termed
"the most consistent commitment" he
had made to the voters during his 1976
campaign.
In a statement for the Oval Office
signing ceremony, Carter said he in
tends to use his reorganization powers
"to make government more respon
sive, efficient and open."
Campaign talk
During the campaign, the president
often talked about reducing 1900 fed
eral departments and agencies to no
more than 200.
Following the signing, Director Bert
Lance of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) told reporters: "I don't
think we ought to say . . . we are going
to cut them to 200."
Lance, who will oversee a four-year
reorganization effort for Carter, argued
it was important to take a searching
look at the bureaucracy before setting

any definite goals for the elimination
of agencies.
"I just don't think we ought to play
the numbers game," said Lance.
