## Mc Coy at Berkeley

An odd mixture of genius and
high school mediocrity tainted
jazz veteran McCoy Tyner's per
formance with the Oakland
Symphony Youth Orchestra last
Friday night in Zellerbach Au
ditorium at Berkeley.
Following an awesome, in
novative set by Tyner and his
sextet, the Oakland Symphony
Youth Orchestra joined the
group, scraping out late entr
ances, nervous string passages
and sour, whining notes.
Performing orchestral works
from Tyner's recent album Fly
with the Wind, the 40-piece
teenage orchestra detracted from
the sextet's style and shattered
the crystal rhythms of Tyner's
compositions.
Nevertheless, the evening's
music retained some power,
exhibiting new directions in
jazz.'
In each piece, Tyner wove
tapestries of sound, combining

fast, crisp piano solos, swirling
impressionistic passages,
pounding left-handed bass lines
and chords, eerie Debussy-like
melodies and constantly chang
ing rhythms and modulations.
The sextet's performance and
percussive variety were excel
lent. The evening's highpoints,
however, were Tyner's solo im
provisations.
Since 1959, Tyner has been a
jazz innovator. He played with
john Coltrane's quarter for six
years, and broke out on his own
in 1965. During the late '60s,
when rock 'n' roll flourished and
jazzmen flocked to the commer
cial gains of electricity, Tyner
suffered financially by refusing
to compromise his musical ide
als and continuing in acousti
cally important and advanced
directions.
In the early '70s, Tyner
emerged again, more powerfully
than before.
