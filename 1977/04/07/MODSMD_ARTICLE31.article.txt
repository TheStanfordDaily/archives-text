Disabled demonstrators leave HEW
Washington — Faced with staying and starving or
leaving as a group, a band of about 50 blind, deaf or
otherwise disabled demonstrators gave up their oc
cupation of the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare headquarters yesterday.
Sporadic discussions between demonstration
leaders and top HEW officials which had gone on
throughout the 28-hour occupation of the secretary's
outer office had broken off shortly before the deci
sion to leave was made.
The demonstrators were demanding immediate
enforcement of civil rights laws for the nation's 25
million handicapped. They promised to return in
greater numbers next month.
There also were similar demonstrations at HEW
regional offices in San Francisco and New York.
About 65 demonstrators were involved in San Fran
cisco and six in New York, according to department
officials.

HEW officials, while expressing sympathy with
the demonstrators' cause, had permitted the
Washington group only one cup ot coffee and one
doughnut each since Tuesday and indicated no more
food would be provided because the demonstration
was technically illegal.
Sadat revises views on Israel
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
signaled yesterday that his country may be willing to
move more quickly toward normal relations with
Israel once a peace settlement is reached.
In a news conference concluding a tour-day visit
to the United States, Sadat omitted past qualifica
tions that normalization of relations with Israel
would take a generation to accomplish after a peace
agreement is signed.
"For sure there will be normalization," Sadat
answered. Although he continued to talk ot having
"to take it gradually," he indicated a compression of
his previous schedule by saying that Whenever we
end the state of belligerency, when we sign a peace
agreement in Geneva ... all this will be easy.
A full relationship including diplomatic recogni
tion, trade, tourism and social and cultural ex
changes has been a basic Israeli demand.
Sadat, as he often does, tried to avoid the appear
ance of having made any concessions, saying, for
instance, that trade with Israel could not be imposed
upon him.
However, he showed signs of flexibility toward
Israel when he spoke for the first time explicitly of
accepting Israel's right to exist, saying "When we
accepted" a 1967 U.S. resolution calling for a secure
and independent Israel "we have accepted Israel."
Time running short for labor contract
Washington — With time running short and the
future of a historic no-strike agreement at stake, labor
negotiators were still haggling yesterday over con
tract terms for 340,000 steelworkers.
Union and industry negotiators faced a self
imposed deadline tonight for reaching agreement
before any unresolved contract issues would go to

arbitration.
The industry's experimental negotiating agree
ment bans an industrywide strike and provides for
arbitration instead. However, both sides are anxious
to avoid allowing any third party to write their con
tract terms.
Both industry and union officials say that if arbit
ration has to be used, it will spell an end to the
unprecedented peace pact.
Rampaging rivers begin to recede
Louisville, Ky. — The Tug Fork river's overflow
ing waters smashed into two more towns along the
West Virginia-Kentucky border yesterday, but most
of the rampaging rivers in Appalachia began to re
cede, leaving behind devastation and mud
encrusted homes.
At least 14 persons had been killed by the floods
since Monday, after storms dumped rain on the reg
ion for up to 30 hours. Tornadoefs generated by the
storm Monday killed 21 persons in Alabama.
Thousands of residents of the flood-ravaged val
leys of Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia and Ten
nessee were left homeless as the waterways began to
return to their banks.
"Ain't nothing left here," said E.T. Ceorgo, as he
looked around Matewan, W. Va. "This town's com
pletely gone."

A full relationship including diplomatic recogni

Sadat, as he often does, tried to avoid the appear

Time running short for labor contract
Washington — With time running short and the
future of a historic no-strike agreement at stake, labor
negotiators were still haggling yesterday over con
tract terms for 340,000 steelworkers.
Union and industry negotiators faced a self
imposed deadline tonight for reaching agreement
before any unresolved contract issues would go to

arbitration.
The industry's experimental negotiating agree
ment bans an industrywide strike and provides for
arbitration instead. However, both sides are anxious
to avoid allowing any third party to write their con
tract terms.
Both industry and union officials say that if arbit
ration has to be used, it will spell an end to the
unprecedented peace pact.
Rampaging rivers begin to recede
Louisville, Ky. — The Tug Fork river's overflow
ing waters smashed into two more towns along the
West Virginia-Kentucky border yesterday, but most
of the rampaging rivers in Appalachia began to re
cede, leaving behind devastation and mud
encrusted homes.
At least 14 persons had been killed by the floods
since Monday, after storms dumped rain on the reg
ion for up to 30 hours. Tornadoefs generated by the
storm Monday killed 21 persons in Alabama.
Thousands of residents of the flood-ravaged val
leys of Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia and Ten
nessee were left homeless as the waterways began to
return to their banks.
"Ain't nothing left here," said E.T. Ceorgo, as he
looked around Matewan, W. Va. "This town's com
pletely gone."

Disabled demonstrators leave HEW
Washington — Faced with staying and starving or
leaving as a group, a band of about 50 blind, deaf or
otherwise disabled demonstrators gave up their oc
cupation of the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare headquarters yesterday.
Sporadic discussions between demonstration
leaders and top HEW officials which had gone on
throughout the 28-hour occupation of the secretary's
outer office had broken off shortly before the deci
sion to leave was made.
The demonstrators were demanding immediate
enforcement of civil rights laws for the nation's 25
million handicapped. They promised to return in
greater numbers next month.
There also were similar demonstrations at HEW
regional offices in San Francisco and New York.
About 65 demonstrators were involved in San Fran
cisco and six in New York, according to department
officials.

HEW officials, while expressing sympathy with
the demonstrators' cause, had permitted the
Washington group only one cup ot coffee and one
doughnut each since Tuesday and indicated no more
food would be provided because the demonstration
was technically illegal.
Sadat revises views on Israel
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
signaled yesterday that his country may be willing to
move more quickly toward normal relations with
Israel once a peace settlement is reached.
In a news conference concluding a tour-day visit

would take a generation to accomplish after a peace
agreement is signed.
"For sure there will be normalization," Sadat
answered. Although he continued to talk ot having
