# Appeal filed for parking fees lawsuit
## 
### Randy Block 
A coalition of employes, faculty and
students is appealing a California Sup
reme Court decision regarding Uni
versity parking fees.
The lawsuit challenges the legality
of annual and quarterly fees levied by
the University for the privilege of park
ing in certain locations.
Plaintiffs in the class-action suit are
United Stanford Employees (USE), the
local affiliate of the International Fire
Fighters Association and all persons
who operate motor vehicles on Uni
versity grounds.
A complaint was first filed Aug. 1,
1975 in the Superior Court of Santa
Clara County, where the court ruled in
favor of the University. In an appeal
earlier this year, the state court of ap
peals upheld the ruling.
The suit charges that the University
is using the police and the courts to
enforce payment of a fee which is es
sentially a tax on vehicle operators. It
also al leges that revenues from the fees
supply 125 per cent to 250 per cent of
administration costs.
Richard Potack, attorney for the
plaintiffs, explained that Section
21113 of the California Vehicle Code
grants certain public and private in
stitutions, including tax-exempt uni
versities, authority to regulate vehicu
lar traffic and parking on their
grounds.
According to Potack, the law in
tends to permit regulations for the
purpose of protecting the safety of the
public or property owner, not for the
purpose of benefiting the owner finan
cially.
In its decision, the court of appeals
saw the parking fees as conditions of a
contractual agreement between the
individual and the University.
The court pointed out that no one is
required to enter into such an agree
ment, and thus the payment cannot be
considered a tax.
Potack, who has filed the appeal,
said that the state supreme court has
not yet decided whether it will hear
the case, but will do so by April 28.
The county court has delayed collec
tion of over 3000 outstanding fines,
pending the state supreme court deci
sion.
