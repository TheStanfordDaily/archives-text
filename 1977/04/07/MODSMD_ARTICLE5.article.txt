# Card Axe laid to rest in new display case

Old traditions came in new packages yesterday at a celebration for the immor
tal Stanford Axe, now resting in its newly-designed case in Tresidder Lounge.
Stanford alumnus Hal Mickelson, the Band and Dollies, gathered at Tresidder
to commemorate the Axe and its legendary history. Mickelson described the new
case as "resistant to nuclear warfare" and recounted the Axe story.
He said the idea of the Axe was conceived by Stanford undergrad Billy Erb on
April 15,1899. After Erb chopped up a Cal bear at a pre-game rally, thelO-pound
Axe was immediately stolen by Berkeley rivals, said Mickelson.
Countless efforts to retrieve the Axe proved fruitless until 1930 when a group
of Stanford students, dubbed the "Immortal 21," attended a Cal rally. Posing as
photographers, they seized the Axe and triumphantly returned it to the Farm.
After the "Immortal 21" incident, both administrations decided to award the
Axe to the "Big Game" winner each fall.
After a close Cal victory in 1972, three disgruntled Stanford students decided
to reverse this administrative decision. They lured Cal with the same ploy used
40 years before, posing as photographers at Ming's restaurant in Palo Alto.
Their mission was successful, which proves, said Mickelson, "how much you
can learn at Berkeley in 40 years."
