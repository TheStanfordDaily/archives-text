# Jordan slate: service, reports

### George Anders 
"We've gotten cast into a mold as a
radical slate, but that's not the case at
all," according to Greg Larson, a
member of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents (COP) ticket headed by Glenn
Jordan.
Larson said he and Steve Westly are
the student services-oriented members
of the slate, while Jordan and Anne

are activist-oriented.
New student services being prop
osed by the slate include an exam file
and a typing service, Larson said. He
also said there are problems with
ASSU Special Events, and called for
closer lies between Special Events and
the University's Public Events.
Henkels said she would like to see
formation of an inter-University coali

tion of women, explaining, "Women
are really up for something here.
There's a lot of energy."
Reports
The ticket also promises to issue re
port.' on issues such as the overseas
program and graduate minority finan
cial aid. Jordan said these studies will
be eftective in the long run.
"I don't think the University will say
'Wow! You've shown us the light,' "
he said. "But that's not our goal. Our
goal is to have a systematic process, to
insure that people continue working
on it."
Jordan said his efforts this year on
increasing the number of minority fa
culty members here will yield that sort
of long-term results.
Yesterday, the slate declared its op
position to a "voluntary" fee assess
ment referendum that will appear on
the ASSU spring ballot.
The referendum, which will serve
only to guide next year's ASSU Senate,
asks students if they want the option of
not paying fee assessments approved
in the previous spring's elections. Cur
rently, students pay all approved as
sessments when they register and can
receive refunds later in the quarter.
Disagreement
"Steve and 1 disagree with the idea
ot 'voluntary' fee assessments," Larson
said yesterday. "We do think refunds
should be easier to get."
On Tuesday evening, Westly said he
