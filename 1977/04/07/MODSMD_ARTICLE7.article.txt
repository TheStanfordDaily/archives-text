# Johnson slate: communication
## 
### Ann Amioka 
Communication is the key to dealing
with campus issues, according to
members of the Rodney Johnson slate
for ASSU Council of Presidents (COP).
Johnson and running mates Kim
Nyegaard, Fran Furtner and Brad kre
voy have proposed working for a
number of changes aimed at improv
ing ASSU-student communication
and increasing student awareness of
campus and non-campus issues.
The governmental changes the slate
is proposing are the most important
part of the group's platform and one
factor that "distinguishes us from
other slates," maintained Nyegaard, a
junior majoring in economics and
communication.
Proposals
The proposed changes include:
— amending the ASSU Constitution
to allow ASSU senators to be elected
from districts;
— creating an educational policies
committee to provide guidanceand in
formation to students on University
academic committees;
— creating an information office to
help students learn more about stu
dent government, among other things;
and
— creating a student services com
mittee to study the feasibility of such
innovations as more copy machines, a
record co-op and extended library
hours during Dead Week and finals,
To be effective, commented
Nyegaard, the COP must have

adequate input and feedback from stu
dents.
"We want students to come to us, yet
we'll make every effort to go out to
them," said Furtner. a junior majoring
in economics and international rela
tions.
Unlike this year's COP, which was
"neither vocal nor visible" when
human rights and Third World issues

arose, said Johnson, his slate plans to
play an active role in such matters.
Johnson, a junior majoring in
economics and African and Afro-
American studies, said he hoped his
COP would be able to support "finan
cially as well as manually" such
groups as the Black Students Union
(BSU), MEChA and the J.P. Stevens
