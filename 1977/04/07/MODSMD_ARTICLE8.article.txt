## Restructure admissions office 
### 
Sosa et al.

How much control should any one
person have over the make-up of the
undergraduate student body at Stan
ford? This was the question raised in
the last meeting of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aids (CUAFA) on Feb. 28.
It was and is the belief of the student
members of the committee that the
position of Dean of Admissions has a
much too crucial role in deciding
which students will eventually attend
this institution.
Swim category
At present, the operation of the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admissions is
as follows: each year approximately
10,000 applications are submitted to
the office. Each application is given an
initial reading by the Dean and two
members of his eight member staff.
According to their recommendations,
the application is either admitted, re
jected or allowed to "swim."
The applications that fall into the
swim category are those that will be
reevaluated at a later time. After all
initial readings and recommenda
tions, about 1000 applications have
been placed into the admit category,
about 5000 have been placed in the
reject category, and about 4000 have
been placed into the swim category.
This first separation process is based
on the relatively objective criteria ot
SAT scores and CPA's. (There are ot
course, serious questions as to how
"objective" these scores really are.)
Although about 1000 students are
admitted in this initial reading, only
about 500 of them will actually enroll
at Stanford. (Due to their high
academic performance, they are
among the most sought after students
in the nation and have been accepted
at several other prestigious univer
sities. This decreases the likelihood of
their enrolling at Stanford.)
The 4000 applications in the swim
category are re-read and from them
another 1500 students are chosen to be
admitted. These are a crucial set of de
cisions since about 1000 of these 1500
students admitted will actually enroll
at Stanford. So it is from the swim
category that the majority of under
graduates are selected.
Subjective criteria
In contrast to the initial admits, the
applications that fell into the swim
category are judged on what can at
times be very subjective criteria. By
definition, the applicants in the swim
category are all academically qualified
to attend Stanford.
The task of the decision-makers is to
choose those types of students who
possess some "special qualities,"
"notable skills." "leadership," "origi
nality." etc. Clearly, all these criteria
imply value judgments that are likely
to be biased according to the
decision-makers' personal or profes
sional preferences.

It is recognized that at some point in
the selection of 1500 students out of
10,000 possibilities some decisions
will inevitably be subjective, or even
arbitrary. It would be impossible to ar
range 10,000 applications in order of
ascending academic achievement.
Students and people in general are too
diverse. Our quarrel is not with the fact
that a good part of the decision making
is subjective. Rather, we focus on the
question of "who makes the deci
sions?"
As stated before, the admissions
staff makes recommendations to Dean
Hargadon. If he agrees to admit the
student is then admitted. If the Dean
does not agree with the recommenda
tions of his staff, the student is either
rejected or sent back to swim for later
consideration.
Veto power
Hargadon has virtual veto power
over any student's admission to Stan
ford. It is said in his defense that he
and his staff rarely disagree and con
sequently he seldom actually vetoes
any recommendations. However,
given the fact that Hargadon person
ally interviews, hires, and trains his
staff the high rate of agreement in his
office may be more a sign of his control
over his staff than a sign of the ease
with which nine people can agree on
which types of students to admit.
So what does that leave us with?
— an admissions office that selects
about 1/3 of the freshman class accord
ing to "objective" SAT's and CPA's.
— an admissions class that selects 2/3
of the freshman class on subjective
criteria.
— a Dean of Admissions that has the
power and responsibility to interview,
hire and train a staff to make these sub
jective decisions.
— a Dean of Admissions who, besides
having tremendous influence over his
staff and the decisions they make, has
absolute veto power over who gets into
Stanford.
At the Feb. 28 meeting of CUAFA,
the majority of those present strongly
opposed a proposal by the student
members to open up the selection pro
cess in regard to the swim category.
The proposal was to create an admis
sions committee composed of stu
dents, staff and faculty.
It was felt that some of the
decision-making should be done by a
more diverse group than the present
admissions staff. Also in the proposal
was the provision to eliminate Harga
don's veto power and to have all deci
sions made by a democratic vote in the
admissions committee.
No proof
Those members of CUAFA who op
posed the proposal claimed that struc
ture and centralized control were not
crucial questions and in the absence of
any concrete proof that Hargadon's
admissions decisions were having a

deleterious effect on the student body
and the University in general, there
was little merit in the proposal.
Their arguments seemed to be in
support of having a "benevolent dic
tator" implement policy. In other
words, there is no need for concern
over the structure of the office as long
as there are no blatant shortcomings in
the product of the office's work, the
student body.
The students on CUAFA feel that the
structure of the admissions office is at
least as important as the product of its
work. If the University is to de
monstrate real efforts to bring diversity
to campus, the structure of the admis
sions office should be one that allows
for a more diverse admissions commit
tee to make the necessary subjective
decisions.
It is our desire that the larger Uni
versity community engage in a discus
sion over the centralization of power
and authority in the Office of Under
graduate Admissions.

nancial Aids (CUAFA) on Feb. 28.
It was and is the belief of the student
members of the committee that the
position of Dean of Admissions has a
much too crucial role in deciding
which students will eventually attend
this institution.
Swim category
At present, the operation of the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admissions is
as follows: each year approximately
10,000 applications are submitted to
the office. Each application is given an
initial reading by the Dean and two
members of his eight member staff.
According to their recommendations,
the application is either admitted, re
jected or allowed to "swim."
The applications that fall into the
swim category are those that will be
reevaluated at a later time. After all
initial readings and recommenda
tions, about 1000 applications have
been placed into the admit category,
about 5000 have been placed in the
reject category, and about 4000 have
been placed into the swim category.
This first separation process is based
on the relatively objective criteria ot
SAT scores and CPA's. (There are ot
course, serious questions as to how
"objective" these scores really are.)
Although about 1000 students are
admitted in this initial reading, only
about 500 of them will actually enroll
at Stanford. (Due to their high
academic performance, they are
among the most sought after students
in the nation and have been accepted
at several other prestigious univer
sities. This decreases the likelihood of
their enrolling at Stanford.)
The 4000 applications in the swim
category are re-read and from them
another 1500 students are chosen to be
admitted. These are a crucial set of de
cisions since about 1000 of these 1500
students admitted will actually enroll
at Stanford. So it is from the swim
category that the majority of under
graduates are selected.
Subjective criteria
In contrast to the initial admits, the
applications that fell into the swim
category are judged on what can at
times be very subjective criteria. By
definition, the applicants in the swim
category are all academically qualified
to attend Stanford.
The task of the decision-makers is to
choose those types of students who
possess some "special qualities,"
"notable skills." "leadership," "origi
nality." etc. Clearly, all these criteria
imply value judgments that are likely
to be biased according to the
decision-makers' personal or profes
sional preferences.

It is recognized that at some point in
the selection of 1500 students out of
10,000 possibilities some decisions
will inevitably be subjective, or even
arbitrary. It would be impossible to ar
range 10,000 applications in order of
ascending academic achievement.
Students and people in general are too
diverse. Our quarrel is not with the fact
that a good part of the decision making
is subjective. Rather, we focus on the
question of "who makes the deci
sions?"
As stated before, the admissions
staff makes recommendations to Dean
Hargadon. If he agrees to admit the
student is then admitted. If the Dean
does not agree with the recommenda
tions of his staff, the student is either
rejected or sent back to swim for later
consideration.
Veto power
Hargadon has virtual veto power
over any student's admission to Stan
ford. It is said in his defense that he
and his staff rarely disagree and con
sequently he seldom actually vetoes
any recommendations. However,
given the fact that Hargadon person
ally interviews, hires, and trains his
staff the high rate of agreement in his
office may be more a sign of his control
over his staff than a sign of the ease
with which nine people can agree on
which types of students to admit.
So what does that leave us with?
— an admissions office that selects
about 1/3 of the freshman class accord
ing to "objective" SAT's and CPA's.
— an admissions class that selects 2/3
of the freshman class on subjective
criteria.
— a Dean of Admissions that has the
power and responsibility to interview,
hire and train a staff to make these sub
jective decisions.
— a Dean of Admissions who, besides
having tremendous influence over his
staff and the decisions they make, has
absolute veto power over who gets into
Stanford.
At the Feb. 28 meeting of CUAFA,
the majority of those present strongly
opposed a proposal by the student
members to open up the selection pro
cess in regard to the swim category.
The proposal was to create an admis
sions committee composed of stu
dents, staff and faculty.
It was felt that some of the
decision-making should be done by a
more diverse group than the present
admissions staff. Also in the proposal
was the provision to eliminate Harga
don's veto power and to have all deci
sions made by a democratic vote in the
admissions committee.
No proof
Those members of CUAFA who op
posed the proposal claimed that struc
ture and centralized control were not
crucial questions and in the absence of
any concrete proof that Hargadon's
admissions decisions were having a

deleterious effect on the student body
and the University in general, there
was little merit in the proposal.
Their arguments seemed to be in
support of having a "benevolent dic
tator" implement policy. In other
words, there is no need for concern
over the structure of the office as long
as there are no blatant shortcomings in
the product of the office's work, the
student body.
The students on CUAFA feel that the
structure of the admissions office is at
least as important as the product of its
work. If the University is to de
monstrate real efforts to bring diversity
to campus, the structure of the admis
sions office should be one that allows
for a more diverse admissions commit
tee to make the necessary subjective
decisions.
It is our desire that the larger Uni
versity community engage in a discus
sion over the centralization of power
and authority in the Office of Under
graduate Admissions.

How much control should any one
person have over the make-up of the
undergraduate student body at Stan
ford? This was the question raised in

At present, the operation of the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admissions is
as follows: each year approximately
10,000 applications are submitted to
the office. Each application is given an
initial reading by the Dean and two
members of his eight member staff.
According to their recommendations,
the application is either admitted, re
jected or allowed to "swim."
The applications that fall into the
swim category are those that will be
reevaluated at a later time. After all
initial readings and recommenda
tions, about 1000 applications have
been placed into the admit category,
about 5000 have been placed in the
reject category, and about 4000 have
been placed into the swim category.
This first separation process is based
on the relatively objective criteria ot
SAT scores and CPA's. (There are ot
course, serious questions as to how
"objective" these scores really are.)
Although about 1000 students are
admitted in this initial reading, only
about 500 of them will actually enroll
at Stanford. (Due to their high
academic performance, they are
among the most sought after students
in the nation and have been accepted
at several other prestigious univer
sities. This decreases the likelihood of
their enrolling at Stanford.)
The 4000 applications in the swim
category are re-read and from them
another 1500 students are chosen to be
admitted. These are a crucial set of de
cisions since about 1000 of these 1500
students admitted will actually enroll
at Stanford. So it is from the swim
category that the majority of under
graduates are selected.
Subjective criteria
In contrast to the initial admits, the
applications that fell into the swim
category are judged on what can at
times be very subjective criteria. By
definition, the applicants in the swim
category are all academically qualified
to attend Stanford.
The task of the decision-makers is to
choose those types of students who
possess some "special qualities,"
"notable skills." "leadership," "origi
nality." etc. Clearly, all these criteria
imply value judgments that are likely
to be biased according to the
decision-makers' personal or profes
sional preferences.

It is recognized that at some point in
the selection of 1500 students out of
10,000 possibilities some decisions
will inevitably be subjective, or even
arbitrary. It would be impossible to ar
range 10,000 applications in order of
ascending academic achievement.
Students and people in general are too
diverse. Our quarrel is not with the fact
that a good part of the decision making
is subjective. Rather, we focus on the
question of "who makes the deci
sions?"
As stated before, the admissions
staff makes recommendations to Dean
Hargadon. If he agrees to admit the
student is then admitted. If the Dean
does not agree with the recommenda
tions of his staff, the student is either
rejected or sent back to swim for later
consideration.
Veto power
Hargadon has virtual veto power
over any student's admission to Stan
ford. It is said in his defense that he
and his staff rarely disagree and con
sequently he seldom actually vetoes
any recommendations. However,
given the fact that Hargadon person
ally interviews, hires, and trains his
staff the high rate of agreement in his
office may be more a sign of his control
over his staff than a sign of the ease
with which nine people can agree on
which types of students to admit.
So what does that leave us with?
— an admissions office that selects
about 1/3 of the freshman class accord
ing to "objective" SAT's and CPA's.
— an admissions class that selects 2/3
of the freshman class on subjective
criteria.
— a Dean of Admissions that has the
power and responsibility to interview,
hire and train a staff to make these sub
jective decisions.
— a Dean of Admissions who, besides
having tremendous influence over his
staff and the decisions they make, has
absolute veto power over who gets into
Stanford.
At the Feb. 28 meeting of CUAFA,
the majority of those present strongly
opposed a proposal by the student
members to open up the selection pro
cess in regard to the swim category.
The proposal was to create an admis
sions committee composed of stu
dents, staff and faculty.
It was felt that some of the
decision-making should be done by a
more diverse group than the present
admissions staff. Also in the proposal
was the provision to eliminate Harga
don's veto power and to have all deci
sions made by a democratic vote in the
admissions committee.
No proof
Those members of CUAFA who op
posed the proposal claimed that struc
ture and centralized control were not
crucial questions and in the absence of
any concrete proof that Hargadon's
admissions decisions were having a

deleterious effect on the student body
and the University in general, there
was little merit in the proposal.
Their arguments seemed to be in
support of having a "benevolent dic
tator" implement policy. In other
words, there is no need for concern
over the structure of the office as long
as there are no blatant shortcomings in
the product of the office's work, the
student body.
The students on CUAFA feel that the
structure of the admissions office is at
least as important as the product of its
work. If the University is to de
monstrate real efforts to bring diversity
to campus, the structure of the admis
sions office should be one that allows
for a more diverse admissions commit
tee to make the necessary subjective
decisions.
It is our desire that the larger Uni
versity community engage in a discus
sion over the centralization of power
and authority in the Office of Under
graduate Admissions.

How much control should any one
person have over the make-up of the
undergraduate student body at Stan
ford? This was the question raised in
the last meeting of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aids (CUAFA) on Feb. 28.
It was and is the belief of the student
members of the committee that the
position of Dean of Admissions has a
much too crucial role in deciding
which students will eventually attend
this institution.
