DNA
Susan Green's criticisms (Daily,
April 1) of my letter on recombinant
DNA research are not unwarranted.
Like everyone else, I speak from a
biased point of view and 1 do have
something to gain from recombinant
DNA research.
As a physics major, I hope to do re
search one day, just as those biologists
are now engaged in DNA research. By
seeking to insure that regulation of
scientific investigation does not go
beyond the bounds of what is reasona
ble from the scientist's point of view,
and at the same time safe from the pub
lic's point of view. 1 hope 1 will not live
in a future where the search for truth is
at the mercy of a vindictive, unin
formed public.
I must strongly disagree with her as
sertions that the vocal minority con
sists only of informed, reasonable
members of the public. 1 believe that
the majority of the outspoken people
are outspoken because they fear gene
tic engineering, and because they call
for a complete moratorium on recom
binant DNA research when even they
must admit that the knowledge of risks
and possible hazards is vanishinglv
small.
When the knowledge of actual risk is
so shaky, is it right to halt basic re
search absolutely without even trying
to weigh the risks and benefits of re
combinant DNA? To do so would be a
violation of human rights even more
basic than revoking the first amend
ment, for this would constitute a revo
cation of the individual's right to think
freely.
The scientist has a responsibility to
refrain from carrying on activities that
could harm society; the converse of
this statement is also true. It is the ba
lance between the two that must be
decided jointly.
I wrote a letter attacking Steve
Hansch's views because they were, to
me, clearly based on unfounded
rumor. I do not object to carrying on a
reasonable forum to help settle a con
troversy. However, if that forum

threatens to confuse the issue in
clouds of emotion, bitter feelings and
more and more misconceptions, then
it will merely aggravate the con
troversy, not settle it, and it is no
longer worth carrying on. In this, at
least, I hope that all agree.

Bicycles
With the rising prices of cars, fuel
and parking spaces, more of the Uni
versity community is taking to bicy
cles than ever before. With this shift in
transportation mode, more bicycle
related problems occur. While large,
paved throughfares are designed for
auto traffic, bicycles are ever more
crowded onto sidewalks where they
alarm pedestrians, mopeds, and each
other.
Portions of Serra Street not used for
automotive travel are in bad need of
repair. The sometime presence of
motorized wooden gates designed to
allow Marguerite safe passage form an
obstacle to bicyclists, and allow cars to
pass when they are broken off. which
is quite often.
One of the worst violations of safety
and conscientious concern comes
from within the bicycling community
itself. Those who refuse to use lights at
night endanger not only themselves,
but other persons, both bicyclists and
pedestrians.
The last bicycle fatality on campus
involved not a collision between bike
and car, but rather two bikes at night.
The owners of one bike show here
pass out arm lights free of charge to
night riders and ask only that they stop
by and pay for them later if they are
able.
1 urge bicyclists to wear helmets and
lights, drivers to treat bicyclists with
respect and planners to fully consider
the dangers faced by bicyclists. Stan
ford should be made safe for non
polluting vehicles.
