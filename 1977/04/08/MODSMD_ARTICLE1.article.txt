# Forum on investments held
## S. Africa action urged

LJp to a point, it is the University's
duty to retain its investments in South
Africa to maintain the struggle to bring
about policy change there," said St.
Clair Drake, emeritus professor of an
thropology.
'University policy is not to be vie
wed as just a sentimental exercise,"
Drake declared. "It is to be viewed as in
line with publicity stated national op
position to apartheid."
"The University's action should be
viewed as an attempt to educate the
business community and challenge it
to think," he said.
Drake made his comments at a forum
on University investment responsibil
ity entitled "Corporate Activity in
South Africa — the Proxy Issues," held
last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
The discussion was the second of two
planned investment responsibility
forums sponsored by the Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
Shareholder pressure has a "visible
impact" on U.S. companies operating
in South Africa, Desaix Myers, a senior
associate of the Investor Responsibil
ity Research Center said.
Home offices
One major incentive for progressive
corporate practices in South Africa

comes from the home offices of U.S.
subsidiaries, which is in turn brought
about by shareholder pressure, Myers
said.
Gillette, Inc. raised its minimum
wage levels in South Africa as a result
of such pressure, he said.
"Change in South Africa is essential
and inevitable to the next couple of
decades," said Laurentius Marais, a
graduate student in mathematics from
South Africa.
"Such change is going to take place
one way or the other," he said. How
ever, if the "unthinkable proposition
of violent overthrow of the govern
ment" came to pass, "the tragic events
of Soweto would ultimately look like a
Sunday school picnic."
Resolutions
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy argued that upcoming
stockholder resolutions on South Afri
can investments fulfill criteria for seri
ous consideration by CIR. These stan
dards are:
— Do the activities of the company
have a direct and substantial effect?
— Does a substantial consensus
exist in the University community?
— Is the economic cost to the Uni
versity commensurate to the effective
ness of the action taken?
Abernethy listed several possible
arguments against corporate activity
in South Africa, which included:
— concern by the prudent investor
about investing in a politically unsta
ble country like South Africa;
— a drop of four per cent below the
international average for corporate re
turns in South Africa because of a re
cession;
— inconsistency by the University
and the corporations in which it in

vests in application of principles they
hold at home, i.e. equal employment
opportunity, and a reduced chance of
U.S. intervention on behalf of the
white minorities in order to protect in
vestments if investments decline.
'Singularly ineffective'
Divestiture of corporate holdings in
South Africa would be "singularly in
effective," according to Marais. South
African law allows only the repatria
tion of profit, not capital.
If complete divestiture took place,
corporations would have to sell off all
holdings and then invest money in
South African government securities
for a period of five years, before the
removal process could be completed,
he said.
The strongest case for University
support of stockholder resolutions
could be made for resolutions which
argue against further investment in
South Africa, Abernethy said.
If it was necessary to vote in favor of
management, it should be done only if
the resolution explicitly envisages
blacks in supervisory positions over
whites, he said.
Drake stressed it is important to vote
for resolutions calling for disclosures.
Myers had stated earlier that labor
practices of U.S. companies appear
similar to and no better than those of
South African companies.
"I am in favor of continued respon
sible U.S. corporation involvement in
South Africa with shareholders on
their backs," said Marais.
South African development means
the country becomes more dependent
on skilled black labor, he said. Effec
tive organization of black labor "is the
most potent weapon available to black
laborers today," he said.
