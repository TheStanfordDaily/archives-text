# Senior presidents slate
## Parties, grad celebration 
### 
Rodriguez et al.

Senior year isn't quite like any other
year. We've taken enough finals and
written papers to last for awhile, and
we can slack otf a little now and have a
good time. Senior Class presidents
can't do everything with $4000, but
with time and effort a lot can be done.
And the office is more than just a joke
(soft asses, tuxedos and hardhats). We
paid for it and we deserve better.
Senior Class presidents are party
throwers and we intend to carry on this
tradition. Parties in White Plaza, pool
parties at deCuerre and happy hours at
Zots are a few of the ideas we have.
Commencement ought to be a celeb
ration rather than an obligation. We
ought to get more out of it than a sorry
Speech by an "important person." The
speaker should be popularly sup
ported and accessible â€” instead of
hopping off a plane at 1 p.m. and leav
ing at 7 p.m. on graduation day.
Seniors should have the opportunity
to meet with the speaker on a more
personal level. This maybe sacrificing
a big name for closer contact, but the
experience would be more meaning
ful. He should be willing and able to
interact with students at senior get

togethers, sherry hours and informal
seminars.
Since a lot of us are entering the real
world next June, the officers can be an
important liaison between the Career
Planning and Placement Center and
the seniors. And leaving the Farm
means leaving behind and losing
touch with friends. We propose com
piling an index of senior post
graduation addresses and career or
educational plans to be distributed at
the end of the year.
We want to add to this list of respon
sibilities. Senior Class presidents
should do more than appeal to just one

section of the Senior Class. They
should also be concerned with foster
ing interactions among different
groups which is more of a challenge.
They should support the activities of
seniors, whether they happen to be
white, black, chicano, Asian or native
American.
We're willing to do a lot for the Class
of 1978. bet us make it happen!
