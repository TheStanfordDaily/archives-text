# Program urged for counselors

### Lindsey How 
Three peer counselors at the
Bridge are trying to start an on
going support group for coun
selors.
The support group will be
"oriented toward the specific
concerns of people who are
trained in specific listening
skills," said John Scott, one of
the coordinators of the support
group.
"The people we are trying to
reach are t hose actively involved
in counseling," he said.
Paul Ashin, another coor
dinator, said he had a "hunch"
there is a need for a support
group. This hunch has been con
firmed in talks with persons who
have taken the Bridge peer coun
seling class, he said.
The activities of the support
group "will depend on the needs
of the people involved," said
Ashin, and meetings will be
"flexible as to what happens."
He said he felt the meetings
will be "oriented towards in
creasing a sense of community
among counselors."
He added that group members

will not divulge the details of
their counselees' problems but
wil 1 focus on "the personal prob
lems related to the role of being a
counselor."
Counselors' problems are
often accentuated by the suppor
tive attitude they regularly take,
he said, commenting that coun
selors will benefit from sharing

their problems with peers.
Wendy Gibson, the third of the
support group's coordinators,
said she wished to stress the fact
that counseling is not an imposi
tion on the counselors.
She said she thought it would
be "nice" to share experiences
because counselors do not talk
over their problems with friends.
