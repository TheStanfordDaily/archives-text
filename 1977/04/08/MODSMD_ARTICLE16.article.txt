# Mexican cuisine tops in Mountain View
## 
### Harry Killas 
Many Mexican restaurants around here (and there
are quite a few) are of the "hole-in-the-wall" variety.
These small, family-run operations offer not only the
most authentic comida but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small establishment on El Camino in
Mountain View, has a stark green and white interior.
Napkins folded into hats rest on all tables. Many of the
restaurant's recipes are favorites of the owner's
mother and range from $3 to $4. These include
huevos rancheros, chicken and beet burritos and
three types of enchiladas. A Mexican steak dinner is
under $5.
A side order of mild guacamole ($1.25) is gener
ously served in a curled corn tortilla with plenty of
chips. Two combination plates ($3.25) that are good
bets are the "Encinada" (beef burrito, tostada, en
chilada and rice and refritos) and the "Cinaloa"
(tacos, enchiladas and chile relleno).
But hamburger was used in these dishes instead of
the more authentic shredded beef. Not only was the
meat small in portion, but it was dry and flavorless as
well. On the other hand, the standard accompani
ments — retried beans and rice (mixed, in this case,
with corn) are both excellent.
Although the service was quick and friendly, the

food, even with added hot sauce, needed more
character.
Tucked away in cosmopolitan Castro Street in
Mountain View is a restaurant that has gained popu
larity with many students here. Poblanita Cafe is to
tally unpretentious — it seats 30, the kitchen is ex
posed and a Latin radio station plays in the
background.
The surroundings belie the food. Everything is ex
tremely tasty and is made from scratch on the pre
mises. "It takes me a long time to do it,"the propriet
ress said, but she added she would not have it any
other way.
The entire menu is in Spanish and lists five egg
dishes (Huevos Rancheros at $2 is the most popular).
The fried chicken is only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad, guacomole, potatoes
and dessert for only $4. Menudo (beef tripe soup) and
Paella Valenciana ($1.75 — the only non-Mexican
item) are weekend specialties.
All combination plates are excellent ($2.60-s2.tto)
and include a crisp house salad, a delectable consome
de polio (chicken broth, garnished with freshly diced
onion, tomato and green chile peppers) and notewor
thy rice and refritos. Don't pass up the Burrito with
chicken chunks in green tomato sauce or the chile
rellenos that contain real jolapenos. Poblanito's tos

tada is a standout —it's succulent chicken pieces on a
bed of lettuce adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storefront restaurant in
Mountain View with tbe most extensive Latin menu
of the three restaurants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here tbe specialties are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations, Plate "B" ($3.75) is a
mouthful and includes tacos, tostada and papusas.
Although the enchiladas and the refritos are not in
spired, the papusas (70 cents a la carte) are a true find.
These are homemade wheat tortillas stuffed with
cheese, pork, beans (or a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage (curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range from beef tongue
($2.95) to yucca root and pork salad ($2.25). Polio
Encebollado — tender chicken in a piquant onion and
tomato sauce is $4.25. The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zucchini, tomato, cab
bage and com on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two unique tropical fruit
drinks — quanabanaand tamarindo — served in hand
carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than those at the other re
staurants, but the portions are larger. El Calderon is a
fun place to go and, consequently, reservations on
Thursday, Eridav and Saturday are a must.
