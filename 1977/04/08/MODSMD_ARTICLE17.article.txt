# Human behavior and self-defense
## Symposium enlightens 
### Marilee Unruh Lisa Sonne 
"The show of interest was as
tonishing for 10 a.m. on a beauti
ful Saturday morning!" said
Fdie Bridges, a staff member
who attended the symposium on
"Human Behavior in Self-
Defense," held last Saturday in
Kresge Auditorium. Approxi
mately 200 students and com
munity members heard a panel
of professionals discuss self
defense, and saw the Saito Nin
jitsu Academy demonstrate it.
Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington, speaking on
the legal aspects of self-defense
quoted a surprising law related
to "deadly weapons": Illegal
possession of a firearm is a mis
demeanor, while possession of
blackjacks, switchblade knives,
brassknuckles, etc. is a felony,
even if the owner's purpose is
self-defense.
Herrington also discussed
"citizens' arrests," explored the
ramifications of one's right to
use "the force necessary" to pre
vent any crime, and explained
police treatment of rape victims.
If the police seem insensitive,
he said, it is because they must
obtain descriptions and evi
dence from the victim quickly if
they are to have any chance of
arresting the rapist.
'Fictional story'
Diana Gutierrez, counselor
and legislative coordinator for
the Marin Rape Crisis Center,
told a "fictional story" of rape
which one woman in the audi
ence said "shook me to the soles
of my feet." Gutierrez gave
examples of the questions attor
neys most often ask rape victims

("Were you wearing a bra?") and
pointed out what she termed the
absurdity of using the same type
of questions applied to robbery
victims ("Didn't you realize that
by wearing such an expensive
suit you were asking to be mug
ged?")
Gutierrez also discussed the
difficulties which rape victims
have in dealing with both shame
and anger. First, the woman
must realize that "he did it to
her, she didn't do it to herself,"
said Gutierrez, "and then she
must overcome the 'nice girl'
image and be angry enough and
into it enough to learn to defend
herself."
Dr. Varda Ganz, a clinical
psychiatrist at Cowell, joined
Herrington and Gutierrez in a
panel discussion. Responding to
questions from the audience,
Ganz said, "Rape is more an act
of violence than of sexual pas
sion. Most rapists have fairly de
cent sex lives apart from rape."
Different approach
Grandmaster Mark Saito, who
holds an eighth degree black belt
in 40 different martial arts as
well as 11 professional licenses
in California (he is an architect, a
structural engineer, a real estate
broker, etc.), approached self
defense from a different angle;
"Those people who make the
laws about deadly weapons — I
wonder if they know what they
are doing. This handkerchief is a
deadly weapon," said Saito,
while subduing an assailant
with a handkerchief.
As his students demonstrated
both ritual dances and self
defense techniques, Saito dis
cussed his art, "Ninjitsu, the art

of human behavior," in terms of
self-defense. "Here is an attacker
with a knife. For him, that knife
is 99 per cent, that knife is it. For
me, that knife is no big deal. It is
only one per cent, because the
physical is only one per cent of
the art."
Saito briefly explained his
philosophy, which is simply
that each person is responsible
for each moment of his or her
own life. One member of the au
dience described Saito as "a man
from another age."
Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of
student affairs, attended the
symposium and commented that
"issues were discussed which
were never all pulled together
before." For Kaplan, who helped
initiate the Marguerite bus ser
vice, safety is "a personal ven
detta." She feels that safety tor
women after dark is expecially
important: "We need to free
women to use the facilities—the
computer center, for
instance —which their tuition
pays for."
For Shannon Phelps, host of
the symposium, the problem is
"not male, not female, but is a
problem of human behavior."
(Phelps noted in the panel dis
cussion that an assault on a man
can be an "invasion of the body"
similar to rape.)
Both Phelps and Kaplan feel
that a self-defense program on
campus can have a broad scope.
Kaplan supports the idea of a
rape and assault data center,
proposed by Phelps. Such a
center, described by Kaplan as
"neutral and confidential,"
would collect, collate and dis

seininate assault information,
and hopefully create a more ac
curate picture ol the campus
situation. "I would be glad to
serve on it." said Kaplan.
Kaplan "would like self
defense to fit into freshman and
RA orientation in a meaningful
way."
Is there really a need for these
programs on our "Utopian"
campus? "Absolutely," says
Kaplan.
The Stanford Workshop on
Human Behavior in Self-
Defense, a course which will
explore in depth the issues
raised in the symposium, will be
taught this spring by Shannon
Phelps. Sign-ups for the work
shop will be in Rm. 33, Roble
Gym, on Monday April 11 from 4
to 6 p.m.
