## Women netters stomp on Davis 
### Jeff Brandon 
Intensity is the key to winning
for a championship team -Diek
Gould, Stanford tennis coach
Apparently the women's ten
nis team has been listening to
Dick Gould. Wednesday the
women played with such inten
sity that they blanked UC-Davis,
9-0.
Probably the best example of
the intenseness Gould was talk
ing about was sophomore Susie
Hagey. Hagey, who took last
quarter off to play the pro circuit,
crushed Davis' Debbie Cator,
6-0, 6-0.
"Susie played an excellent
match," said coach Anne Hill.
Hagey played tough throughout
the match displaying her deadly
forehand.
"The score is misleading to
how good Debbie Cator really is.
She is a fine player but Susie
never let her play her game,"
Hill said.
Third-set triumph
With the return of Hagey,
sophomore Diane Morrison
moved down to the No. 2 slot.
The All-American from Los
Angeles, split the first two sets
with Joan Pennello, but in the
third set she came back to win,
6-3, 4-6, 6-0.
Nancy Rudd, playing third
singles, was just too consistent
for Aggie Nancy Marx. The
junior from Denver demolished
Marx with her back court game
and won, 6-3, 6-2.

Nancy Anderson, No. 4, took
three sets to dispose of Diane
DiMartini. In the closest match
of the day Anderson beat DiMar
tini, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.
Marianne Ingard at the No. 5
spot, took care of Barbara Root,
6-1, 6-4, while No. 6 player, Pat
Varga, had no trouble beating
Holly Henvell, 6-0, 6-3.
In doubles competition, the
Card women were even more
impressive, losing just four
games in three matches. Defend
ing collegiate women's doubles
champs, Morrison and Hagey,
had not played a match together
since last summer. They dealt
Pennello and DiMartini a 6-2,
6-1 loss.
Inexperience hidden
Anderson-Ingard also had li
mited match play experience but
their inexperience did not show
as the Card women beat Cator-
Marx, 6-0, 6-1.
Varga-Rudd had never played
a match together before Wed
nesday. Varga, who usually
teams up with Barb Jordan,
played almost flawlessly

throughout the match. Both
Varga and Rudd put away sev
eral shots at the net, winning
easily over Henvell-Root, 6-0,
6-0.
Next weekend the Card
women travel to UCLA and USC.
Stanford will be playing without
Ail-American Barb Jordan who
has tendinitis in her shoulder

and is out for an indefinite
period.
