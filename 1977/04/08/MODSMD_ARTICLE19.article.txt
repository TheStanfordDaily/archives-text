# Spikers win
## 
### 
Card spikers downed Cal-
Poly in four games last night,
but were not very impressive
in doing so. Stanford won,
15-13, 10-15, 15-12 and
16-14.
Head coach Art Lambert
said, "We played terrible de
fense. When the presure came
on, we let them off the hook."
Cal-Poly was up for the
game and played with a re
vengeful spirit because of a
three-game loss in an earlier
match this season.
Said Lambert, "They're
tougher now because they've

adjusted to our attack."
According to player Rod
Fletcher, the pressure was on
for the Cards to win this con
test. Every victory counts to
ward a regional berth.
"We needed this game," he
said. "Lambert really put the
pressure on by saying that we
have to win everything."
Tonight the Cards take on
the Olympic Club at 7:30 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. The
Cards beat the tough San
Francisco club in a matchup
earlier this year.
