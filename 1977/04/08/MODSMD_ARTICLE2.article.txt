# Seven slates vie to head senior class
## 
### Sue Rice 
This spring seven slates are running
for senior class presidents, each with a
different make-up and goals.
The John kanin slate stresses in
volvement of off-campus seniors and
discusses the possibility of an off
campus center. In addition to tradi
tional functions of the officers, the
slate wants to create an outreach prog
ram for seniors seeking employment.
This program would help seniors
contact employers and "besides just
giving seniors a good time â€” prepare
them with information sessions."
).). Chao, Nancy Singleton and Pepe
Brown are running with kanin. A
political science major, kanin has
served as SCIRE chairman and has sat
on the Guest Professorship Board.
'Course Guide'
Chao, also a political science major,
is an ASSIJ senator and participant on
the Course Guide policy board.
Singleton, American Studies major,
was an Eating Club Business Manager
and a peer counselor at the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC).
Brown, also a political science
major, was an alternate senator and a
teaching assistant.
"Quality instead of quantity" is the
central theme of the Peter Breck slate.
Breck, Terry Elms, Chris Mennis and
John Motulsky, said they want to com
bine efforts to increase turnout and
quality of senior events.
Organization, energy and en
thusiasm will be major components of
their office, members say, in order to
ensure successful activities. Some of
their ideas include a senior Renais
sance Fair, a river trip, sky diving ex
pedition and renting deGuerre pool.
Dorm president
Motulsky, a sociology major, served
as dorm president and social chairper
son at Stanford-in-England.
Elms, a history major, was a Dolly,

Social Chairperson at Tours, and par
ticipated in house government in
Branner. Mennis is a philosophy major
and Peter Breck is majoring in political
science.
The Rosa Rodriguez slate consists of
Rodriguez, an economics major, Jeff
Dal Cerro, an American studies major,
Teri Vollnogle, a history and human
biology major, and Bruce Framback, a
chemistry major.
Although all active in their previous
college years, slate members said they
did not consider expe* 1 jnce necessary.
They said they feel the two prerequis
ites for senior class officer are first, de
termi nation and second, to be a senior.
Limitation
Realizing the limitations of the
senior class officers, Vollnogle said
she wants to elaborate and improve on
past functions. Included activities will
be dances, pool parties at deGuerre,

and a boat party in San Francisco.
She said the ticket will also compile
a list of postgraduate addresses and
career plans in order to locate persons
after graduation.
Vollnogle said she hopes to make
the commencement speaker more ac
cessible to students. Ticket members
said their biggest concern is to include
all segments of the class, and not limit
participation to white, upper-middle
class students.
The Clark Sterling slate started or
ganizing in January and Sterling said
the key theme is to be "constructive
workers for the senior class." Sterling,
Beverly "Bubbles" Standing, Pam
Strike and Peter Jones said they want
to execute several traditional duties in
novel ways.
Senior newsletter
Slate promises include two senior
newsletters per quarter. The newslet

ter will include dates and times of ac
tivities, as well as CPPC and Alumni
Contact Service information.
Sterling also said the slate wants the
senior class to vote on the top five
commencement speakers, after ad
ministration input is considered. This
will enable the senior class to have the
final say, they say.
A third plank of their slate is to pub
lish the Class of '78 directory at the
beginning of the year. Slate members
said they want big social events each
Quarter: a semi-formal in the City, a
folk dance on the Bay, a day on the
green, old-fashioned picnics, a senior
snow trip and talent show.
Clark Sterling was a social chairman
at El Tigre Eating Club, Standing is
currently a house associate in Larkin
dorm, Pam Strike was a social events
organizer in Tours and is a member of
