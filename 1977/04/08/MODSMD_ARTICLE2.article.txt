## 
### Sue Rice 
This spring seven slates are running
for senior class presidents, each with a
different make-up and goals.

contact employers and "besides just
giving seniors a good time — prepare
them with information sessions."

"Quality instead of quantity" is the
central theme of the Peter Breck slate.

John Motulsky, said they want to com
bine efforts to increase turnout and
quality of senior events.
Organization, energy and en

pedition and renting deGuerre pool.

college years, slate members said they
did not consider expe* 1 jnce necessary.
They said they feel the two prerequis

termi nation and second, to be a senior.
Limitation
Realizing the limitations of the
senior class officers, Vollnogle said
she wants to elaborate and improve on
past functions. Included activities will
be dances, pool parties at deGuerre,

and a boat party in San Francisco.
She said the ticket will also compile
a list of postgraduate addresses and
career plans in order to locate persons
after graduation.
Vollnogle said she hopes to make
the commencement speaker more ac

said their biggest concern is to include
all segments of the class, and not limit
participation to white, upper-middle

novel ways.
Senior newsletter

Sterling also said the slate wants the
senior class to vote on the top five
commencement speakers, after ad
ministration input is considered. This
will enable the senior class to have the
final say, they say.
A third plank of their slate is to pub
lish the Class of '78 directory at the
beginning of the year. Slate members
said they want big social events each
Quarter: a semi-formal in the City, a
folk dance on the Bay, a day on the
green, old-fashioned picnics, a senior
snow trip and talent show.
