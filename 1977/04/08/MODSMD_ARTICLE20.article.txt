# Stanford meets UCLA in three
## Card nine travels south 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
heads south to Los Angeles
today for a three-game Pacific-8
series against the UCLA Bruins.
The two teams meet for the first
time this season in a si ngle game
today at 2:30 p.m., then again
tomorrow for a noontime doub
leheader.
UCLA enters the series with a
slight advantage after taking
three games from Cal two weeks
ago in its league opener. More
recently, however, the Bruins

have not played as strongly, and
their 16-19 season record should
serve as a boost for the Cards, 0-3
in Pac-8 but 33-10 for the season.
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess stressed the importance of
the series this weekend. "We
have to do well — take two out of
the three games at least — to be
able to catch USC." Marquess
said he looks forward to close
contests from the evenly
matched teams.
"Anything's liable to hap
pen," Marquess said. "It's been

tough tor us to win down there
the past two years but UCLA's
home park (Sawtelle Field) is a
very small park (390 feet in
center, 336 feet down the lines)
and a fly ball can easily be a
home run. A hot-hitting Guar
dino or someone could easily
make the difference."
Marquess said he expects
trouble from UCLA's pitching
ace, Tim O'Neill, Friday night.
The Bruin righthander's biggest
asset is his command of pitches.
The Bruins' leftfielder, Dave
Baker, and catcher Dennis De
laney are also good ballplayers
and pose threats in the upcom
ing series.
Sophomore southpaw Rob
Irwin is scheduled for mount
duty today. Bruce Fiala is tenta
tively scheduled for the first
game of tomorrow's doub
leheader with Brian Harrison,
Larry Kuhn or John Yandle
slated for the final game of the
series.
