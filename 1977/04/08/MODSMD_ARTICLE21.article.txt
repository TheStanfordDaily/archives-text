# Alpha Sig in title quest
## 
### Bill Wernecke 
Everybody has an impossible dream. Some
may want to scale Everest or even Hoover Tower.
Others are pre-meds. Still others really believe
that they will get that lone 'A' in Professor
Horn's Political Science 10 class this quarter.
Wayne Easter is from Alpha Sig, a coed frater
nity in the Cowell Cluster, and he wants to win
the IM 'B' league softball championship this
spring. Badly.
A look at the apparently easygoing senior
from Richmond and one would never guess that
he is a bona fide IM softball fanatic. His books are
neatly stacked on the shelves, and besides, he is
already fulfilling one impossible dream by
going to med school next year.
Get Easter to talk about softball, however, and
he becomes a man possessed. Justifiably so,
since Coach Easter's Alpha Sig teams have suf
fered only one regular season loss in the past
three years, without the benefit of extensive re
cruiting.
Tools of trade
No sooner can one ask Easter a question about
IM softball then he'll open his closet door. Out
comes his aluminum "Black Max" softball bat
and a brand-new official "Clincher" 16-inch
softball.
One notices the A 1 Kaline autographed
baseball glove with tfie huge pocket which is
hanging out over the dresser. Easter takes a few
well-measured cuts with the "Black Max" and
talks about last year's team.
The Alpha Sig team begah its season with
typical aplomb, as only seven players showed
up in a battle against the awesome Delts. Early in
the game centerfielder Easter saw one of the few
hits that even he couldn't get to.
"Ramsey Blackburn hit a ball that Willie Mays
couldn't have caught!" he says in awe.
Strong tradition
But the Alpha Sig tradition was evidently
stronger than the Delt softball team. Despite
playing without a catcher or a second baseman,
the Alpha Sig team hit two home runs in the
bottom of the seventh inning to take a 14-9 vic

tory.
After that contest, playing the rest of the sea
son with nine men seemed easy. The team swept
through its league undefeated and put on some
remarkable defensive displays.
"We went into the quarterfinals with a streak
of four straight shutouts," Easter recalls. They
won that game, too, but lost to the champion
Miracles, 8-4, in the semifinals.
Last chance
This year is Easter's last chance for the coveted
title. When asked about his team's prospects, he
bemoans the losses of Roland Young and
shortstop Mark Chalpin. In the same breath,
though, he introduces his two new partners in
the outfield, sophomore Mike Glover and a mys
tery recruit to be named later.
In walks pitcher "Tiger" Allyn, a key member
of last year's squad. Any pitcher nicknamed
"Tiger" can't be half bad, and according to Eas
ter he "leads the IM softball leagues in strike
outs" and possesses an amazing between-the
legs pitch.
When asked about that pitch, Allyn just
shrugs his shoulders and smiles. "I usually rely
on my three-finger knuckleball," he admits,
"but when I'm on the mound, the ball can come
from anywhere."
Not most talented
Easter dons his official Stanford coaching cap
and leans back. "We definitely do not have the
most talented team in IM softball," he cautions.
He attributes the team's past success to its
adherence to strict IM softball fundamentals —
hitting dinkers over the infielders' heads for
cheap base hits.
"The Miracles are the most talented team we
faced. If they're back this year, they'll win it,"
Wayne says. Then the man with the impossible
dream puts back on a big smile. "I'll tell you one
thing," he says, "if we make it into the finals this
year, we'll win."
Faulty reasoning? Perhaps. But maybe when
you fulfill oneimpossible dream, thesecond one
is a little bit easier.

Horn's Political Science 10 class this quarter.
Wayne Easter is from Alpha Sig, a coed frater
nity in the Cowell Cluster, and he wants to win
the IM 'B' league softball championship this
spring. Badly.
A look at the apparently easygoing senior
from Richmond and one would never guess that
he is a bona fide IM softball fanatic. His books are
neatly stacked on the shelves, and besides, he is
already fulfilling one impossible dream by
going to med school next year.
Get Easter to talk about softball, however, and
he becomes a man possessed. Justifiably so,
since Coach Easter's Alpha Sig teams have suf
fered only one regular season loss in the past
three years, without the benefit of extensive re
cruiting.
Tools of trade
No sooner can one ask Easter a question about
IM softball then he'll open his closet door. Out
comes his aluminum "Black Max" softball bat
and a brand-new official "Clincher" 16-inch
softball.
One notices the A 1 Kaline autographed
baseball glove with tfie huge pocket which is
hanging out over the dresser. Easter takes a few
well-measured cuts with the "Black Max" and
talks about last year's team.
The Alpha Sig team begah its season with
typical aplomb, as only seven players showed
up in a battle against the awesome Delts. Early in
the game centerfielder Easter saw one of the few
hits that even he couldn't get to.
"Ramsey Blackburn hit a ball that Willie Mays
couldn't have caught!" he says in awe.
Strong tradition
But the Alpha Sig tradition was evidently
stronger than the Delt softball team. Despite
playing without a catcher or a second baseman,
the Alpha Sig team hit two home runs in the
bottom of the seventh inning to take a 14-9 vic

tory.
After that contest, playing the rest of the sea
son with nine men seemed easy. The team swept
through its league undefeated and put on some
remarkable defensive displays.
"We went into the quarterfinals with a streak
of four straight shutouts," Easter recalls. They
won that game, too, but lost to the champion
Miracles, 8-4, in the semifinals.
Last chance
This year is Easter's last chance for the coveted
title. When asked about his team's prospects, he
bemoans the losses of Roland Young and
shortstop Mark Chalpin. In the same breath,
though, he introduces his two new partners in
the outfield, sophomore Mike Glover and a mys
tery recruit to be named later.
In walks pitcher "Tiger" Allyn, a key member
of last year's squad. Any pitcher nicknamed
"Tiger" can't be half bad, and according to Eas
ter he "leads the IM softball leagues in strike
outs" and possesses an amazing between-the
legs pitch.
When asked about that pitch, Allyn just
shrugs his shoulders and smiles. "I usually rely
on my three-finger knuckleball," he admits,
"but when I'm on the mound, the ball can come
from anywhere."
Not most talented
Easter dons his official Stanford coaching cap
and leans back. "We definitely do not have the
most talented team in IM softball," he cautions.
He attributes the team's past success to its
adherence to strict IM softball fundamentals —
hitting dinkers over the infielders' heads for
cheap base hits.
"The Miracles are the most talented team we
faced. If they're back this year, they'll win it,"
Wayne says. Then the man with the impossible
dream puts back on a big smile. "I'll tell you one
thing," he says, "if we make it into the finals this
year, we'll win."
Faulty reasoning? Perhaps. But maybe when
you fulfill oneimpossible dream, thesecond one
is a little bit easier.
