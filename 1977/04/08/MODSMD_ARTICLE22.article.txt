# Stanford hosts Oxy
## Cindermen seek to even series 
### Bruce Anderson 
Stanford has met Occidental
College's track team 21 times
over the years and Card coach
Pavton Jordan has been involved
in each meeting, six times as
coach of the Oxy Tigers and 15
times directing the cardinal and
white.
Jordan has coached the win
hing school in 12 of these track
and field encounters and said he
Would like to side with the vic
tors again Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
His desire stems not from con
fcern for his personal record in
the matchups with the school he
formerly served as both track
eoach and athletic director, but
from the fact that for the first
time in more than two decades
the Cardinals have a chance to
even the intrastate series. Occi
dental leads the series, 11-10.
i And although the Cards match
Vip favorably with Oxy in nearly
every event, Jordan and his team
are not approaching the meet
lightly.

"We're not taking Occidental
lightly, they are a sleeping giant
just like Fresno State," Jordan
said. (Fresno beat Stanford,
85-78, in March.) "Beating Stan
ford would make their season."
Nonetheless, Stanford's en
tries have been juggled slightly
for this meet to provide stamina
work for those running longer
distances than normal, and
speed work for those running
shorter distances than usual.
Some of the meet's best per
sonal matchups come in the
100-meter dash, the 1500-meter
run, the 110-meter high hurdles
and the high jump.
In the century Stanford's Mar
vin Holmes, with a season best of
10.48, and Alan Sheats vie with
Oxy's Tony Edwards (10.5). For
Sheats, normally a standout
quarter-miler, it will be his first
open 100 of the season.
JC champ
Oxy s Tom Colley (3:50.2)
tests the Cards' Jeff Parietti in the
1500. Colley won the California
Junior College title last spring

while running for San Ber
nadino Valley }C. Parietti, who
runs the 1500 for the first time
this year, had a best of 3:50.2 last
season.
Card hurdler Tom Shellworth
(14.4) and Oxy's Larry David
(14.4) square off in the high hur
dles. Shellworth (52.9) and
David (55.4) also face each other
in the intermediates.

Tiger freshman Kevin Hall
(6-10V4) and teammate Kevin
Cuervo (6-BV2) leap against Card
high jumpers John Littleboy
(6-9) and Kent Doyle (6-5) in an
eyent Jordan said can go any
way.
The meet begins with the long
jump and pole vault at 1:15 p.m.
while track events get underway
at 1:45 p.m. with the 3000-meter
steeplechase.
