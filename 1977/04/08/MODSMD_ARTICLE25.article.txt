# Cards on comeback trail
## Stanford smashes Utah, 8-1 
### Jeff Brandon 
After the California match last
Tuesday, Dick Could, coach of
the Cards, had a 30-minute
locked-door meeting with his
team. Whatever he said ought to
be repeated because yesterday
the Cards dealt a tough Utah
team an 8-1 loss.
National Amateur Indoor
champ Matt Mitchell led the way
again. The potential superstar
from Palo Alto polished off Kent
Crawford, 6-4, 6-2.
"Crawford's a tough player,"
said Gould. "Last year he beat
(JSC's Chris Lewis in the NCAAs
and was on the All-America
team."
Apparently no one told
Mitchell it was supposed to be a
tough match. He served and vol
leyed to an easy win. More con
fident now in his ability to per
form, Mitchell looks like he
might be following in the
footsteps of John Whitlinger as
Stanford's next NCAA champ
ion. Having lost only one match
(to a hot Bruce Manson), Mitch
ell could easily be called one of
the top collegians in America.
If one wants to find another
college player in Mitchell's
class, one does not have to look
far. Second man Bill Maze also
has a good shot at winning the
NCAAs. Yesterday he downed
his old friend, Dave Sherbeck,
6-4, 3-6, 6-1. "Willie Maze" got
his game together in the third set
and put it to Sherbeck.
"It's good to have Perry
Wright back in the lineup," said
Gould. "He's been one of our
best competitors all year and we
missed him."
Wright beat Jim Greenberg,
6-4, 7-6, and then teamed with
Matt Mitchell in doubles, win
ning a 7-6, 6-2 decision over
Sherbeck and Crawford.
The only loss the Cards suf
fered was in No. 4 singles. Tom
Mullin beat John Rast, 6-4, 7-6.
"It was a good win for me,"
commented Mullin. "I played
really well. I don't think John
played up to his capabilities. He
didn't serve well in the tie
breaker."
Rast has not played well this
year in singles and he's still
struggling. But following yes
terday's match Rast sounded de
termined to whip his next com
petitor. Yesterday was the last
straw.
"John had a tough quarter last
quarter," Gould said. "He had a
sprained ankle, pulled stomach
muscles and a virus. He's had to
start from scratch. Give him a
couple of wins for his confi
dence and he'll be there. He
played excellent doubles to
day."
Rast teamed up with Bill Maze
to beat Greenberg and Dave
Thornburg.
One Card who did break out of
a slump was Jim Hodges. Play
ing sixth he beat Derk Wharton,
6-4, 6-0. "It's been a while," said
Hodges who had lost his last four

decisions for the Cards. "All 1
can say is its great to win. I
needed this win for my confi
dence. I'll be ready for USC and
UCLA."
Hfth man Lloyd Bourne, still
lighting a case of the flu, beat
Dave Thornburg, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2. In
a match where service breaks
were the rule, not the exception,
Bourne fought back to win in the
third set.
" This is the first day I've even

been able to eat. I was still really
weak out there," Bourne said.
The Cards will play 17th
ranked San Jose State next Tues
day and then will have to face
defending NCAA co-champions
UCLA Thursday and USC Satur
day.
How will the Cards do?
On paper the Cards seem to
have the best team in the country
if they play up to their potential.
But the question with this team

is: will they play up to their po
tential?
Probably Stanford tennis en
thusiast Bob Heintz said it best
when he said, "This team is
ready to explode."

the top collegians in America.
If one wants to find another
college player in Mitchell's
class, one does not have to look
far. Second man Bill Maze also
has a good shot at winning the
NCAAs. Yesterday he downed
his old friend, Dave Sherbeck,
6-4, 3-6, 6-1. "Willie Maze" got
his game together in the third set
and put it to Sherbeck.
"It's good to have Perry
Wright back in the lineup," said
Gould. "He's been one of our
best competitors all year and we
missed him."
Wright beat Jim Greenberg,
6-4, 7-6, and then teamed with
Matt Mitchell in doubles, win
ning a 7-6, 6-2 decision over
Sherbeck and Crawford.
The only loss the Cards suf
fered was in No. 4 singles. Tom
Mullin beat John Rast, 6-4, 7-6.
"It was a good win for me,"
commented Mullin. "I played
really well. I don't think John
played up to his capabilities. He
didn't serve well in the tie
breaker."
Rast has not played well this
year in singles and he's still
struggling. But following yes
terday's match Rast sounded de
termined to whip his next com
petitor. Yesterday was the last
straw.
"John had a tough quarter last
quarter," Gould said. "He had a
sprained ankle, pulled stomach
muscles and a virus. He's had to
start from scratch. Give him a
couple of wins for his confi
dence and he'll be there. He
played excellent doubles to
day."
Rast teamed up with Bill Maze
to beat Greenberg and Dave
Thornburg.
One Card who did break out of
a slump was Jim Hodges. Play
ing sixth he beat Derk Wharton,
6-4, 6-0. "It's been a while," said
Hodges who had lost his last four

decisions for the Cards. "All 1
can say is its great to win. I
needed this win for my confi
dence. I'll be ready for USC and
UCLA."
Hfth man Lloyd Bourne, still
lighting a case of the flu, beat
Dave Thornburg, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2. In
a match where service breaks
were the rule, not the exception,
Bourne fought back to win in the
third set.
" This is the first day I've even

been able to eat. I was still really
weak out there," Bourne said.
The Cards will play 17th
ranked San Jose State next Tues
day and then will have to face
defending NCAA co-champions
UCLA Thursday and USC Satur
day.
How will the Cards do?
On paper the Cards seem to
have the best team in the country
if they play up to their potential.
But the question with this team

is: will they play up to their po
tential?
Probably Stanford tennis en
thusiast Bob Heintz said it best
when he said, "This team is
ready to explode."

The Wright man
Card netter Perry Wright returned to the lineup yesterday after missing two matches because of
stomach flu. The junior from Beverly Hills beat Utah's Jim Greenberg, 6-4, 7-6.
After the California match last
Tuesday, Dick Could, coach of
the Cards, had a 30-minute
locked-door meeting with his
team. Whatever he said ought to
be repeated because yesterday
the Cards dealt a tough Utah
team an 8-1 loss.
National Amateur Indoor
champ Matt Mitchell led the way
again. The potential superstar
from Palo Alto polished off Kent
Crawford, 6-4, 6-2.
"Crawford's a tough player,"
said Gould. "Last year he beat
(JSC's Chris Lewis in the NCAAs
and was on the All-America
team."
Apparently no one told
Mitchell it was supposed to be a
tough match. He served and vol
leyed to an easy win. More con
fident now in his ability to per
form, Mitchell looks like he
might be following in the
footsteps of John Whitlinger as
Stanford's next NCAA champ
ion. Having lost only one match
(to a hot Bruce Manson), Mitch
ell could easily be called one of
the top collegians in America.

breaker."
Rast has not played well this
year in singles and he's still
struggling. But following yes
terday's match Rast sounded de
termined to whip his next com
petitor. Yesterday was the last
straw.
"John had a tough quarter last
quarter," Gould said. "He had a
sprained ankle, pulled stomach
muscles and a virus. He's had to
start from scratch. Give him a
couple of wins for his confi
dence and he'll be there. He
played excellent doubles to
day."
Rast teamed up with Bill Maze
to beat Greenberg and Dave
Thornburg.
One Card who did break out of
a slump was Jim Hodges. Play
ing sixth he beat Derk Wharton,
6-4, 6-0. "It's been a while," said
Hodges who had lost his last four

decisions for the Cards. "All 1
can say is its great to win. I
needed this win for my confi
dence. I'll be ready for USC and
UCLA."
Hfth man Lloyd Bourne, still
lighting a case of the flu, beat
Dave Thornburg, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2. In
a match where service breaks
were the rule, not the exception,
Bourne fought back to win in the
third set.
" This is the first day I've even

been able to eat. I was still really
weak out there," Bourne said.
The Cards will play 17th
ranked San Jose State next Tues
day and then will have to face
defending NCAA co-champions
UCLA Thursday and USC Satur
day.
How will the Cards do?
On paper the Cards seem to
have the best team in the country
if they play up to their potential.
But the question with this team

is: will they play up to their po
tential?
Probably Stanford tennis en
thusiast Bob Heintz said it best
when he said, "This team is
ready to explode."
