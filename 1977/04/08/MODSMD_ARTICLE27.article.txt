Carter calls off plutonium processing
Washington — President Jimmy Carter called off U.S.
Plutonium processing yesterday in an international bid to
arrest the spread of the fuel that also is fit for atomic bombs.
Carter recognized that some nations may need to repro
cess plutonium and use it for power generation, but ad
ministration officials said Carter wants them to keep this
technology to themselves and not export it to other nations
that might misuse it to make nuclear bombs.
To show he means business, Carter announced a series of
seven nuclear policies, including a slowdown of U.S. de
velopment of the "nuclear breeder reactor," a type of pow
erplant that would convert an otherwise unusable form of
uranium into plutonium that could be used as additional
nuclear fuel or in atomic weapons.
Carter noted that plutonium "is especially poisonous"
among nuclear fuels. Plutonium is both radioactive and
chemically toxic.
Carter left in doubt the fate of the proposed Clinch River
Breeder Reactor, a $2-billion project to build a 380-
megawatt plant to produce both power and plutonium near
Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Carter's announcement drew immediate opposition from
congressional backers of nuclear power.
