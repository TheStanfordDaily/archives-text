# New turmoil ensues as Rabin resigns post
## 
### 
Tel Aviv (AP) —Prime Minister Yit
zhak Rabin announced his resignation
yesterday over a money scandal and
withdrew his candidacy for election in
national voting May 17.
Rabin's stunning move plunged the
nation into fresh political turmoil, and
it was not clear who would succeed
him as leader of the Labor party in the
election just 40 days away.
Technically, the law does not allow
Rabin to resign because the govern
ment he heads is in transition until the
election.
Rabin said he would "act to wind up
my office" but added he had not yet
determined whether the law could en
able him to leave office before May 17.
Rabin, 54, announced his decision
ltt hours after two influential Israeli
newspapers gave new reports about
Rabin and his wife allegedly violating
Israeli currency regulations by having
dollar bank accounts in the United
States.
The papers mentioned sums of up to
$20,000.
When the allegations were first
made last month, Rabi n said there was
$2000 in a single Washington savings
account.
By law, he should have closed the
account six months after he left his

post as ambassador to Washington in
mid-1973.
Sources close to Rabin said he prob
ably would remain as nominal prime
minister until the election, turning
over his duties to his deputy, Foreign
Minister Yigal Allon.
The second most powerful figure in
the Labor party and the man most
likely to head the party's list at the
polls is Defense Minister Shimon
Peres.
Rabin announced his decision in a
nationwide radio and television inter
view and called it "a sad end."
But he said he had to take responsi
bility for the U.S. bank account he and
his wife maintained.
Rabin said the sum in the bank was
$18,000 when he left Washington,
dropped to $10,000 and was $2000
when an Israeli reporter in
Washington found out about it last
month.
In his television address, Rabin said
he had offered to pay a fine for what he
called his "mistake and negligence,"
but he added the attorney general re
fused and said his wife, Leah, would
have to face criminal proceedings.
There was no indication whether
Rabin would be questioned by police
about the bank account.
