# How now Chairman Mao?

H. Bruce Franklin (right) was granted tenure yester
day at Rutgers' Newark campus with the unanimous
approval of that university's board of trustees.
Franklin, a nationally known Melville scholar, was
fired from his post as a tenured English professor
here in 1972 for his role in the Feb. 10,1971 occupa
tion of the Computation Center by area anti-war ac
tivists. He is shown here at that event arguing with
Don Tamm (left) and another member of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's office. Franklin still has a First
Amendment suit pending against Stanford to reverse

his firing. He was co-founder of the Bay Area Re
volutionary Union (now the national Revolutionary
Communist party) which emerged in early 1969 as an
influential Maoist faction in the rapidly splintering
Students for a Democratic Society. In December
1970, Franklin and most of the Peninsula area mem
bers of the Revolutionary Union split from that or
ganization and joined with Chicano Maoists to form
the Venceremos organization. The now-defunct
Venceremos organization stressed the central impor
tance of racial minority groups and urged participa
tion in an on-going urban guerilla war against the
American government.
