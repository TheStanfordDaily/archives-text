# Organizations request fee assessment okay
## 
### Chris Wasney 
Students will vote next week on $13
of fee assessments for eight student or
ganizations, according to Randy Bird,
ASSU elections commissioner.
The groups on the ballot are the
Band, KZSU, the Academic Organiza
tion Board, the Legal Counseling Of
fice, the Course Guide, a program fee,
the Guest Professorship Board and the
Daily.
Most fee assessments are for one
quarter, and if passed, will cause each
student to be assessed $1 for the or
ganization during fall registration.
After refunds, groups have usually re
ceived about $10,000 from a one quar
ter fee assessment.
The Daily and KZSU are seeking
three quarter fee assessments, and the
Band is asking for a two quarter one.
KZSU's budget
According to John Morris, business
manager of KZSU, its $30,000 fee as
sessment would provide over 90 per

cent of the station's budget.
"Without the fee assessment, we
would be forced to severely cut back
on news and public affairs presenta
tions," Morris said. "Also, as equip
ment and records wore out, we
couldn't replace them."
Though the assessment is only 10
per cent of the Daily budget, business
manager Newell LaVoy said "the fee
assessment is crucial to us, as without
it, we could not put out any expanded
editions.
"Also, it would severely deplete the
Daily's reserve fund, which keeps the
paper afloat when it is losing money
during bad economic times."
'Cut out trips'
The Band's $20,000 assessment is
approximately one-third of its budget,
according to Band Manager Rich
Johnson. "We receive money from the
Athletic and Music Departments," he
stated, "but without the fee assess
ment, we would have to cut all of our
out of state trips."
For other groups, such as the Legal
Counseling Office and the Guest Pro
fessorship Board, the fee assessment is
100 per cent of their budget. Iris
Boudart, Legal Counseling Service
Secretary, stated that "the only income
we receive other than the assessment is
from wills, which was only $20 last
quarter."
The Course Guide hopes to use their
$10,000 assessment for two years,
which would cover 50 per cent of its
budget, according to Course Guide
Chairman Greg Larson.
Small organizations
The program fee is a one quarter as
sessment distributed among smaller
organizations which cannot obtain
their own fee assessments. This year,
total group requests were $34,000 from
the $10,000 fund. Group allocations
were determined by the ASSU Senate
Finance Committee and Student Fi
nancial Manager Chris Mathe.
According to Mathe, criteria for dis
tribution were how many students an
organization affects or benefits, how
well it has utilized past grants, and
how well its budget is organized.
Groups budgeted for program fee
grants include the Publications Board
($1000), the Escondido Nursery
School ($900), and the Bridge ($800).
In addition, a small discretionary fund
would be drawn from the Program Fee
and used by the ASSU Senate next fall
to appropriate money for organiza
tions that failed to request assessments
this year.
The Academic Organizations Board
similarly supports smaller organiza
tions, such as many of the under
graduate departmental association,
and Stanford-in-Law and Stanford
in-Government.
Conferences
In addition, the Board may attempt
to revive the Stanford Review, and
bring several academic conferences to
Stanford, according to Board Chair
man Pat Flinn.
Also on the ballot will be two re
ferenda on whether students should
have the option of not paying their as
sessment, rather than having to come
back later in the quarter for a refund.
According to ASSU Sen. Doug Ban
dow, who sponsored the measures,
"these referenda are only designed to
gauge student opinion. They will not
go into effect if they are passed — the
senate might then take action.
"I introduced these measures be
cause the current system seems unfair,
but 1 don't want to do away with them
(fee assessments) altogether."
To pass, assessment proposals need
a majority vote, with at least 20 per
cent of the student body (2219) voting.
To get on the ballot, Mathe said or
ganizations desiring fee assessments
either filed a petition to the COP,
signed by at least 10 per cent of the
student body or appeared before the
Senate Finance Committee at least two
weeks before the election date.
Before the committee, groups pre
sented detailed financial information,
such as itemized expenditures and
proposed budgets, according to
Mathe.
Five organizations were approved
by the senate and placed on the ballot.
Two more, the Daily and KZSU, qual
ified by petition.
The eighth proposed assessment, for
the Band, will appear on the April 15
run-off ballot because the Band failed
to meet the April 4 deadline for sub
mitting the financial information. This
mix-up was due to a "lack of com
munication between the Band and the
senate," according to Rich Johnson.

cent of the station's budget.
"Without the fee assessment, we
would be forced to severely cut back
on news and public affairs presenta
tions," Morris said. "Also, as equip
ment and records wore out, we
couldn't replace them."
Though the assessment is only 10
per cent of the Daily budget, business
manager Newell LaVoy said "the fee
assessment is crucial to us, as without
it, we could not put out any expanded
editions.
"Also, it would severely deplete the
Daily's reserve fund, which keeps the
paper afloat when it is losing money
during bad economic times."
'Cut out trips'
The Band's $20,000 assessment is
approximately one-third of its budget,
according to Band Manager Rich
Johnson. "We receive money from the
Athletic and Music Departments," he
stated, "but without the fee assess
ment, we would have to cut all of our
out of state trips."
For other groups, such as the Legal
Counseling Office and the Guest Pro
fessorship Board, the fee assessment is
100 per cent of their budget. Iris
Boudart, Legal Counseling Service
Secretary, stated that "the only income
we receive other than the assessment is
from wills, which was only $20 last
quarter."
The Course Guide hopes to use their
$10,000 assessment for two years,
which would cover 50 per cent of its
budget, according to Course Guide
Chairman Greg Larson.
Small organizations
The program fee is a one quarter as
sessment distributed among smaller
organizations which cannot obtain
their own fee assessments. This year,
total group requests were $34,000 from
the $10,000 fund. Group allocations
were determined by the ASSU Senate
Finance Committee and Student Fi
nancial Manager Chris Mathe.
According to Mathe, criteria for dis
tribution were how many students an
organization affects or benefits, how
well it has utilized past grants, and
how well its budget is organized.
Groups budgeted for program fee
grants include the Publications Board
($1000), the Escondido Nursery
School ($900), and the Bridge ($800).
In addition, a small discretionary fund
would be drawn from the Program Fee
and used by the ASSU Senate next fall
to appropriate money for organiza
tions that failed to request assessments
this year.
The Academic Organizations Board
similarly supports smaller organiza
tions, such as many of the under
graduate departmental association,
and Stanford-in-Law and Stanford
in-Government.
Conferences
In addition, the Board may attempt
to revive the Stanford Review, and
bring several academic conferences to
Stanford, according to Board Chair
man Pat Flinn.
Also on the ballot will be two re
ferenda on whether students should
have the option of not paying their as
sessment, rather than having to come
back later in the quarter for a refund.
According to ASSU Sen. Doug Ban
dow, who sponsored the measures,
"these referenda are only designed to
gauge student opinion. They will not
go into effect if they are passed — the
senate might then take action.
"I introduced these measures be
cause the current system seems unfair,
but 1 don't want to do away with them
(fee assessments) altogether."
To pass, assessment proposals need
a majority vote, with at least 20 per
cent of the student body (2219) voting.
To get on the ballot, Mathe said or
ganizations desiring fee assessments
either filed a petition to the COP,
signed by at least 10 per cent of the
student body or appeared before the
Senate Finance Committee at least two
weeks before the election date.
Before the committee, groups pre
sented detailed financial information,
such as itemized expenditures and
proposed budgets, according to
Mathe.
Five organizations were approved
by the senate and placed on the ballot.
Two more, the Daily and KZSU, qual
ified by petition.
The eighth proposed assessment, for
the Band, will appear on the April 15
run-off ballot because the Band failed
to meet the April 4 deadline for sub
mitting the financial information. This
mix-up was due to a "lack of com
munication between the Band and the
senate," according to Rich Johnson.
Students will vote next week on $13
of fee assessments for eight student or
ganizations, according to Randy Bird,
ASSU elections commissioner.
The groups on the ballot are the
Band, KZSU, the Academic Organiza
tion Board, the Legal Counseling Of
fice, the Course Guide, a program fee,
the Guest Professorship Board and the
Daily.
Most fee assessments are for one
quarter, and if passed, will cause each
student to be assessed $1 for the or
ganization during fall registration.
After refunds, groups have usually re
ceived about $10,000 from a one quar
ter fee assessment.
The Daily and KZSU are seeking
three quarter fee assessments, and the
Band is asking for a two quarter one.

ment, we would have to cut all of our
out of state trips."
For other groups, such as the Legal
Counseling Office and the Guest Pro
fessorship Board, the fee assessment is
100 per cent of their budget. Iris
Boudart, Legal Counseling Service
Secretary, stated that "the only income
we receive other than the assessment is
from wills, which was only $20 last
quarter."
The Course Guide hopes to use their
$10,000 assessment for two years,
which would cover 50 per cent of its
budget, according to Course Guide
Chairman Greg Larson.
Small organizations
The program fee is a one quarter as
sessment distributed among smaller
organizations which cannot obtain
their own fee assessments. This year,
total group requests were $34,000 from
the $10,000 fund. Group allocations
were determined by the ASSU Senate
Finance Committee and Student Fi
nancial Manager Chris Mathe.
According to Mathe, criteria for dis
tribution were how many students an
organization affects or benefits, how
well it has utilized past grants, and
how well its budget is organized.
Groups budgeted for program fee
grants include the Publications Board
($1000), the Escondido Nursery
School ($900), and the Bridge ($800).
In addition, a small discretionary fund
would be drawn from the Program Fee
and used by the ASSU Senate next fall
to appropriate money for organiza
tions that failed to request assessments
this year.
The Academic Organizations Board
similarly supports smaller organiza
tions, such as many of the under
graduate departmental association,
and Stanford-in-Law and Stanford
in-Government.
Conferences
In addition, the Board may attempt
to revive the Stanford Review, and
bring several academic conferences to
Stanford, according to Board Chair
man Pat Flinn.
Also on the ballot will be two re
ferenda on whether students should
have the option of not paying their as
sessment, rather than having to come
back later in the quarter for a refund.
According to ASSU Sen. Doug Ban
dow, who sponsored the measures,
"these referenda are only designed to
gauge student opinion. They will not
go into effect if they are passed — the
senate might then take action.
"I introduced these measures be
cause the current system seems unfair,
but 1 don't want to do away with them
(fee assessments) altogether."
To pass, assessment proposals need
a majority vote, with at least 20 per
cent of the student body (2219) voting.
To get on the ballot, Mathe said or
ganizations desiring fee assessments
either filed a petition to the COP,
signed by at least 10 per cent of the
student body or appeared before the
Senate Finance Committee at least two
weeks before the election date.
Before the committee, groups pre
sented detailed financial information,
such as itemized expenditures and
proposed budgets, according to
Mathe.
Five organizations were approved
by the senate and placed on the ballot.
Two more, the Daily and KZSU, qual
ified by petition.
The eighth proposed assessment, for
the Band, will appear on the April 15
run-off ballot because the Band failed
to meet the April 4 deadline for sub
mitting the financial information. This
mix-up was due to a "lack of com
munication between the Band and the
senate," according to Rich Johnson.
