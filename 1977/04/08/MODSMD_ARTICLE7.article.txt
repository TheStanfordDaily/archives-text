## Opinions Editorial Support Johnson slate 
### 
The Daily endorses Rodney Johnson, Kim
Nyegaard, Fran Furtner and Brad krevoy for
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP). Of the four
slates running for COP, the Johnson slate seems
most aware of issues affecting students. It has the
best chance of accomplishing something in of
fice because its members' past performances
show they can adeptly compromise — a crucial
skill when dealing with the University administ
ration.
We do have some reservations about the slate,
however.
The Johnson slate's platform contains many
advocacy planks.
Certainly the COP has a responsibility as an
official voice of the students to take stands on
issues of student concern such as tenure, corpo
rate responsibility and minority affairs. How
ever, it does not have the time or the staff to
become deeply involved in these issues. It
should leave grass roots work to special interest
groups which have shown themselves willing
and capable of organizing support.
We feel a council has the best chance of being
effective by concentrating on providing
adequate services to students. Therefore, we
urge the Johnson slate to spend most of its time
revitalizing current services such as Special
Events and the Travel Service's charters and im
plementing its own service programs.
. The Johnson slate advocates restructuring the
committee system before proposing concrete
plans for services. We caution the slate against
getting too bogged down in the politics and red
tape of administrative reorganization.
We agree with the Johnson slate's proposals
for educational reform, particularly lobbying for
implementation of the tenure task force report
and reviving Dead Week. We also feel the slate's
plans to publish a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford and to eliminate RAs in Escondido Village
are good. The slate appears aware of graduate
student concerns and has made implementable
proposals even without a graduate student on
the slate.
However, we strongly disapprove of the slate's

plan to revise the ASSU Senate election process.
It would be nearly impossible to divide students
into equitable districts and to have meaningful
accessibility to off-campus representatives.
The Jordan slate is the only other ticket which
has covered many timely issues and adequately
researched its stands. While the two slates have
remarkably similar proposals in their platforms,
we feel the Jordan slate has some serious de
ficiencies.
The slate, which has a senate alternate on it,
has little knowledge or concern for senate ac
tions which will affect the entire student body.
The slate does not oppose the "purely volun
tary" fee assessment resolution the senate has
placed on the ballot. The passage of this resolu
tion would be the first step in a process which
would cripple some student organizations and
destroy others such as KZSU and the Legal
Counseling Office.
The Jordan slate purports to represent many
diverse interests. Yet it has not recognized the
severe consequences of the resolution to many
diverse student groups such as the BSU and
MEChA which depend on the program fee for
part of their budgets. The Johnson slate
staunchly opposes this resolution.
We also question the Jordan slate's ability to
compromise. While Glenn Jordan, who heads
the ticket, and Anne Henkels have proved them
selves aggressive advocates, they have not
shown an ability to work with their opponents.
Instead, they have approached issues with a
closed mind which has hurt their effectiveness.
Brad Krevoy of the Johnson slate has also had
difficulties accomplishing his goals. His grand
standing has seriously hurt his credibility and
authority in the senate. However, we feel he will
be more effective in the COP where he does not
have to receive senate approval to implement
many of his plans.
As for the other contestants, we found the Doc
ters slate uninformed and the allegedly humor
ous Alben slate inappropriately silly at a time
when serious issues confront the students.

difficulties accomplishing his goals. His grand
standing has seriously hurt his credibility and
authority in the senate. However, we feel he will
be more effective in the COP where he does not
have to receive senate approval to implement
many of his plans.
As for the other contestants, we found the Doc
ters slate uninformed and the allegedly humor
ous Alben slate inappropriately silly at a time
when serious issues confront the students.
The Daily endorses Rodney Johnson, Kim
Nyegaard, Fran Furtner and Brad krevoy for
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP). Of the four
slates running for COP, the Johnson slate seems
most aware of issues affecting students. It has the
best chance of accomplishing something in of
fice because its members' past performances
show they can adeptly compromise — a crucial
skill when dealing with the University administ
ration.
We do have some reservations about the slate,
however.
The Johnson slate's platform contains many
advocacy planks.
Certainly the COP has a responsibility as an
official voice of the students to take stands on
issues of student concern such as tenure, corpo
rate responsibility and minority affairs. How
ever, it does not have the time or the staff to
become deeply involved in these issues. It
should leave grass roots work to special interest
groups which have shown themselves willing
and capable of organizing support.
We feel a council has the best chance of being
effective by concentrating on providing
adequate services to students. Therefore, we
urge the Johnson slate to spend most of its time
revitalizing current services such as Special
Events and the Travel Service's charters and im
plementing its own service programs.
. The Johnson slate advocates restructuring the
committee system before proposing concrete
plans for services. We caution the slate against
getting too bogged down in the politics and red
tape of administrative reorganization.
We agree with the Johnson slate's proposals
for educational reform, particularly lobbying for
implementation of the tenure task force report
and reviving Dead Week. We also feel the slate's
plans to publish a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford and to eliminate RAs in Escondido Village
are good. The slate appears aware of graduate
student concerns and has made implementable
proposals even without a graduate student on
the slate.
However, we strongly disapprove of the slate's

plan to revise the ASSU Senate election process.
It would be nearly impossible to divide students
into equitable districts and to have meaningful
accessibility to off-campus representatives.
The Jordan slate is the only other ticket which
has covered many timely issues and adequately
researched its stands. While the two slates have
remarkably similar proposals in their platforms,
we feel the Jordan slate has some serious de
ficiencies.
The slate, which has a senate alternate on it,
has little knowledge or concern for senate ac
tions which will affect the entire student body.
The slate does not oppose the "purely volun
tary" fee assessment resolution the senate has
placed on the ballot. The passage of this resolu
tion would be the first step in a process which
would cripple some student organizations and
destroy others such as KZSU and the Legal
Counseling Office.
The Jordan slate purports to represent many
diverse interests. Yet it has not recognized the
severe consequences of the resolution to many
diverse student groups such as the BSU and
MEChA which depend on the program fee for
part of their budgets. The Johnson slate
staunchly opposes this resolution.
We also question the Jordan slate's ability to
compromise. While Glenn Jordan, who heads
the ticket, and Anne Henkels have proved them
selves aggressive advocates, they have not
shown an ability to work with their opponents.
Instead, they have approached issues with a
closed mind which has hurt their effectiveness.
Brad Krevoy of the Johnson slate has also had

authority in the senate. However, we feel he will
