## Narconan, tenure 
### 
Bufano
Dr. Randolph Bufano wrote that my
article, "City Balks on Drug Services"
(Daily, March 31), "contained a major
error of fact" (Daily, April 5). I stated in
the article that Palo Alto terminated
Narconon's contract "after the city de
cided the program had been ineffec
tive."
This statement is not in error as I will
show.
Bufano said the actual reason the
contract was terminated was "because
Narconon allegedly did not comply
with a city council directive to expand
the board of directors to facilitate
wider community involvement in the
program."
This is also true. In fact, there were
several contributing factors to the ci
ty's decision, one of which was that the
program had successfully treated only
seven clients for drug abuse in the
10-month period prior to cancellation
of the contract.

I was simply listing one of these
reasons, in an article that dealt essen
tially with another resolution. Bufano
can also note that the expansion of the
board was requested to help make the
program more responsive and more ef
fective.
It is curious that Bufano's name does
not appear in the minutes of the Dec. 6
Palo Alto City Council meeting at
which the council decided to discon
tinue the program. And it also seems
strange that he has chosen to wait al
most four months to speak out on the
city's action.

Tenure
Students Interested in Tenure (SIT)
sponsored a forum on Tenure and
Teaching Evaluation, the evening of
April 4. The turnout was relatively
small, despite the presence of Presi
dent Richard Lyman, Dean of En

gineering William Kays and Asst.
Political Science Professor Harry
Harding.
Conspicuous in their absence were
members of the ASSU Senate, who
chose to hold their own senate meeting
rather than attend this important
forum on the tenure process.
Most notably, of the slates running
for next year's COP, no one from the
Johnson slate was in attendance, and
only one member of the Jordan slate
found it worth his while.
How can these groups claim to be
informed and concerned about these
issues if they don't find the time to
attend such meetings as members of
the student community? And what of
the ASSU Senate? Are they represent
ing the best interests of the students?
Why were all these representatives,
both present and future, not in atten
dance?
