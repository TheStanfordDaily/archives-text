# It's another tequila sunrise...
## 
### 
The music was heard as far away as El Camino. After an
estimated 25 calls to the police (President Richard
Lyman was the 21 st) campus security ordered the rock
and roll band Monsoon to stop playing. The event was
the University's first annual Tequila Sunrise Party, put
on by the residents of Alpha Sigma Phi in the Cowell
cluster. Staged at 6 a.m. last Friday, the affair is reputed
to have awakened some 1500 people. The event's
planners, Robert Crankders, Bud Aldem and Sue
Coughman maintain that this could have been the best

party the University has seen in years. After only 10
minutes dozens of Cowell cluster residents were partak
ing of the free champagne and tequila sunrises. But by
6:15 the police had arrived and the event came to a
semi-climactic halt. People continued to congregate
though and according to Crankders two cases of cham
pagne and five gallons of tequila sunrises were con
sumed in a little less than an hour. Aldem regrets that the
band had to knock off so early calling the fiasco "quite
the bite." However he feels that despite the party's short
duration, a fine time was had by all.
