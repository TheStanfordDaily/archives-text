# Some thoughts for ASSU voters

Students planning to vote in this
week's ASSU election will have only a
partial opportunity to express them
selves on an issue which has domi
nated discussion in the ASSU Senate
this year: how (and whether) to limit
the expenditure of student money
through the ASSU organization.
Of course, the fee assessment re
ferenda provide a means for direct
evaluation of the cost and benefit of
various activities, and this mechanism
is to be cherished.
Apparently, however, the ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) campaign
is not going to address itself to the
issue of expense. Instead, it consists of
the usual appeals to special interests,
with little regard to who pays the price
for these favors.
In evaluating the various COP slates,
it is best to pay attention to promises
only so far as they point to a basic
philosophy which will guide the slate
once it assumes office, and most im
portantly to the past actions of those
who seek the $9000-a-year COP
throne.
If there is a basic philosophy to the
front-running Brad Krevoy slate, it
seems to be that we live in a world of
plenty, where one can promise more of
everything to everyone at a cost to no
one.
This belief squares with Krevoy's
own performance in the senate, where
he has supported the demands of vir
tually every special-interest group that

has walked through the door, with lit
tle thought given to the burden which
these requests would place on the gen
eral student body.
Certainly Krevoy isn't alone in this
regard. Sen. Steven Westly, running
on the slate which he and Greg Larson
put together, has shown a similar proc
livity for doling out student money.
The Krevoy slate says it plans to
form two new executive committees.
One, on "educational policies," would
coordinate and assist student commit
tee members (which the committee
staff assistant is now supposed to do)
and "establish (dictate?) educational
priorities for student members to pur
sue." Another would oversee efforts to
improve student services.
I wonder whether the slate is aware
of the substantial clerical costs which
both these panels would add to the
ASSU organization, not to mention the
burgeoning bureaucracy which they
would engender. Further, I thought we
elected a COP to perform these tasks;
why must we employ more paper
shufflers in the decision-making pro
cess?
Another issue is the support which
both major slates, and particularly
K.-evoy's, have expressed for so-called
affirmative action programs and for ef
forts to change policies of the admis
sions and financial aid offices.
Of course, efforts to aid members of
groups which have suffered past dis
crimination are justifiably popular.

However, the harm to the general stu
dent body of suggested remedies is
once again ignored. How many at
Stanford really favor reverse discrimi
nation quotas? And how long are we
going to accept the shibboleth that re
cent changes in financial aid policies
deter minority applicants, when all
admissions office data show this to be
false?
Krevoy's position on the matter was
demonstrated earlier this year when he
pushed a senate resolution demanding
that a $200 increase in self-help expec
tations not be instituted. He did so
even after it was shown that the money
had to come from somewhere â€”
even-higher tuition being the most
likely alternative. Most of his fellow
senators saw this; the resolution lost,
10-2.
Krevoy's most disappointing per
formance in the senate has been his
adamant opposition to allowing stu
dents to vote on the salaries of their
elected officers. Throughout the
lengthy debate on this matter, he has
been the senate's leading proponent of
the idea that student politicos are
somehow blessed with a wisdom on
the matter that their peers lack.
It was a crushing defeat for those of
us who've tried to give students a hold
on their own government when the se
nate, largely because of a changing
membership and absences, killed the
vote-for-salaries proposal last week.
To his credit, Westly spoke out in favor

of the plan prior to its demise.
From neither major slate have I seen
a commitment to avoid the type of
politicalization of the ASSU which oc
curred under past COPs, and which
the Petroff COP, to its credit, has
largely avoided.
In fact, the inference 1 draw from
both slates' platforms is that the ASSU
office will once again become a head
quarters for pet political causes, as it
was last year under the Rosenbaum
COP, and two years prior to that under
Kevin O'Grady.
Students might give some thought
as to whether they wish the ASSU or
ganization they finance to devote its
energies to pushing viewpoints with
which they may disagree.
On that score, voters might also
question whether they wish to turn
over another $10,000 assessment to the
ASSU Guest Professorship Board,
which throughout its lifespan has
shown an unwillingness to cater to the
wishes of the vast majority of the stu
dent body, preferring instead to seek
professors conforming to the board's
own political ideology.
Some reforms in the board's com
position have been instituted for next
year, and it may be wise to carry over
the program's current $4000 balance to
see whether the reforms will work,
rather than risking another expensive
fiasco.
