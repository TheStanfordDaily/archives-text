# Senior class slates

What can we realistically do for the
Class of '78 in our senior year? In the
past, senior class presidents have had
troubles insuring a successful year due
to organizational and information dis
persal problems.
Seniors have been apathetic toward
past class presidents' activities, have
been isolated off campus and simply
haven't been attracted to spending
another afternoon with the few who
made it to Zots. Class presidents have
had trouble with an uncompromising
University administration in regard to
commencement speaker selection. We
must get the Class of '78 together.
We will be seniors at Stanford only
one year (those of us who graduate).
Those muscle-shirted fraternity
loud-mouths and barefooted radicals
(to name the extreme members of our
campus community) will soon be
memories of the past.
We as senior class presidents will
help to culminate our four years here
with direct personal interaction with
all types. We must roust seniors from
their comfortable nests (be it co-op.
fraternity, dorm, mobile home or bird
house).
We must get together as a graduating

class for memories' sake, for personal
broadening and toleration of life
styles' sake, for good times' sake and
for Pete's sake (we all must know a
Pete!).
To insure senior awareness and en
thusiasm for our events, we will circu
late surveys to find out which ac
tivities you want, set up a "Senior
News" column in the Daily to make
sure that all seniors have up to date
info on events and employment oppor
tunities, supplement the column with
a detailed newsletter and publish a
senior register to help us stay in con
tact with one another.
We will start work early in the year
to make your commencement speaker
choice top priority. Last year's first
choice was rejected by the administra
tion. We don't want that to happen to
us.
Finally, if you elect us, we'd like to
start bringing the Class of '78 together
with a Zots run this spring!
We have the energy, organization
and desire to work for you.
