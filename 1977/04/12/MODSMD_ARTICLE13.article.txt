# Barth et al.
## 
### 
We know what Seniors want: loose
booze, tight ball games and a warm
place to study. But, there's more to us
than meets the senses, especially, of
course, taste. Our opponents can only
offer you smell.
Unlike the "class" less clowns who
promise to be "Al Your Service," and
the hard hats whose "crate ideas" as
sure us of a Senior Class next year, we
are god-persons.
Our slate gingerly submits )on
Barth, president of Hammer and Cof
fin, a man who has selflessly brought
laughter to students, faculty and staff
alike for well-nigh three years.
Second, but not tertiary, we duti
fully deliver Kathy Trafton, savagely
ambitious young journallass.
Authoress of "ASSU Whispers," fea
tured in both the Chappie and the
Daily, Trafton is not afraid to call them
the way she wants to. And when she
wants to.
To help balance out the slate, Kathy
also likes people.
Third, but not last, we unashamedly
introduce Rusty Schwartz (his real

name). His other hobbies include mak
ing phony phone calls. Rusty is cur
rently working on a novel without
names or pronouns.
Fourth, we proudly present Kim
West, a double-E major who, in all
seriousness, is majoring in Electrical
Engineering (go for it, nerds!).
We are confident that Kim has many
wonderful ideas as she leads the
women in the Band to peaks of creative
rastiness. Kim promises "more parties
at Zot's," which seems reasonable as
we haven't had any yet.
We hope we're not just whizzing in
the zephyr. The next time a swollen
handed candidate approaches you for
a shake, give him a Hearst burger: two
buns without a patty.
You know our opponents won't
change, so you know they ain't gunna
work.
(fori Barth and Kathy Trafton are
juniors majoring in communication.
Rusty Schwartz is a junior majoring in
political science. Kim West is a junior
majoring in electrical engineering.)
