We can make confusion work. There
are approximately 1500 students in the
junior class, each with his own ideas,
morals and bathroom habits, and it is
clearly an impossible task to organize
them all. (Anyone who believes diffe
rently, we know of a bridge in Brook
lyn you might be interested in.) How
ever, we do have ideas that might ap
peal to some members of this diversely
chaotic assemblage.
Would you like to meet John Kaplan,
William Dement, Herant Katchadou
rian, Ward B. Watt, Hubert Marshall,
Misha Zafran and other big name pro
fessors up-close and personal? A
senior-faculty cocktail hour or beer
bust might be your chance.
Or maybe you would like a full
moon, a warm spring night, beer, a
band, and the chlorine-laden deGuerre
pools as the setting for a senior party?
For the academic minded, a senior
go-to-class day where all seniors go to
classes on a particular day; and for

those not interested, a senior-not-go
to-class day where no seniors go to
classes on a particular day (not to be
confused with weekends, Feb. 29, or
spring quarter). And, if the administra
tion lets us, we might even dig up an
interesting commencement speaker.
We realize there's a trend of apathy
towards politics, but we know there's
no apathy toward having a good time;
we feel the major function of the senior
class presidents is to provide that good
time. Feedback from you will help us
give you the best possible time.
Ideas from 1500 can be confusing,
but we'll take that confusion and make
it work. We don't expect everyone to
be satisfied with everything, but we
hope everyone will be satisfied with
something.

juniors majoring in biology. Jim
Moroney is a junior mojoring in
economics. Cathy Person is a junior.)
