### 
The Sterling slate for senior class
presidents . . . why? Senior Class Pres
idents are workers for their class, not
politicians. We are constructive work
ers with ideas and enthusiasm for a
great senior year!
Between us, we have worked in such
positions as the social chairperson of
an eating club, R.A. of a freshman
dorm, president of a four-class dorm,
and overseas campus social director.
As a senior class slate, we have been
together since January, and as a group
of friends, we work together well.
We'd make constructive additions to
the officers' traditional duties. We will
hold a senior class vote on the top five
proposed commencement speakers,
after seniors' registration day sugges
tions and the administration's input
have been considered.
Senior newsletters will be put out
twice each quarter. These will sum
marize and publicize important news
from especially the CPPC and Alumni
Contact Service, which offer voca
tional information, "how to inter

view" and resume writing seminars,
and opportunities for students to con
tact alumni in similar fields.
Class of '78 directories will be avail
able at the beginning of the year, with
current and home addresses listed.
Most of all, the class of '78 deserves
well organized, fun senior activities.
We'll continue the happy hours, but
we'll plan two big social events each
quarter: dances such as a semi-formal
evening in the City and boat dance on
the bay, sports like a day on the green
and old-fashioned Spring Picnic, a
senior snow skiing trip, talent show,
etc.
Please let us know about your ideas
and additions too. We're ready to get
working on the construction that's un
derway â€” for the senior class.
