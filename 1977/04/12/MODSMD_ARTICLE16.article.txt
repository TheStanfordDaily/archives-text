## 'Daily' endorsement illogical 
### 
Jordan et at.

The Daily has endorsed the losing
slate in the last three ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP) elections; we are not
disappointed by the Daily's endorse
ment of the Johnson (Krevoy) slate. We
are disturbed, however, by the faulty
assumptions, outright distortion of
truth and illogical conclusions which
the Daily used as the basis for its en
dorsement.
In fact, nothing in the editorial indi
cates that they even read our platform.
First, contrary to the editorial, we do
not support the proposal for voluntary
fee assessments. The Daily's conclu
sions were based on an inarticulate re
sponse to a poorly worded question.
Second, the Daily charges Jordan
and Henkels with being "close

minded. "There is no basis for this per
sonal affront â€” unless the Daily be
lieves that taking a stand on controver
sial issues after careful consideration
of both sides constitutes close
mindedness.
Furthermore, the Daily questions
our slate's ability to work effectively
with the ASSU and the administration.
Anyone who knows Greg Larson
realizes this to be absurd. More than
any candidate in this election, Greg
has the respect of University adminis
trators. He has worked extensively on
the ASSU Course Guide and on the
Committee on Evaluation of Teaching.
Indeed, he was the only student
acknowledged by the Task Force Re
port on Tenure and Teaching Quality.
In turn, Glenn Jordan and Anne

Henkels, while being concerned with
student advocacy, are both eager to
work within legitimate channels to ef
fect change.
Finally, we seriously question the
Daily's assertion that the COP should
ignore taking positions on issues. To
ignore areas that directly affect stu
dents is not to represent them at all.
The Jordan-Larson-Henkels-Westly
slate feels capable of providing stu
dent services, as well as being a legiti
mate channel for student input into
University affairs. We feel that this is
what the Council of Presidents is all
about.
(Glenn Jordan, Greg Larson, Anne
Henkels and Steve Westly are candi
dates for the Council of Presidents.)
