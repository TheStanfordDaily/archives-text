# Johnson platform unrealistic
## 
### 
Docters et al.

Speaking for Robert Docters, Leslie
Brettell, Larry Berz and myself (Peter
Hausknecht), I would like to register a
reaction to this year's Daily COP en
dorsement in favor of another slate.
That decision was not a surprise to
me; indeed, it was expected. The Daily
is merely continuing with its recent
tendency to endorse the slate that pro
duces the most specific platform. The
more issues contained in that plat
form, the better.
Note that a criterium of this en
dorsement is not whether the issues
are realistic or even remotely practical.
Sheer volume of proposals predomi
nates.
Some slates, in an effort to please
everyone, have put forth so many
proposals it grows absurd. For exam
ple I quote the Johnson slate's optimis
tic suggestion ". . . parental income
should not be a determinate of
graduate (financial) aid." That slate
may as well have opined that all

women ought to be gorgeous and the
weather constantly superb. Neither
goal can be realized, unfortunately.
The Daily endorsement dismisses
our slate as "uninformed." This state
ment is both true and false, depending
on what you consider "informed."
Obviously the Daily considers ASSU
politicos the only informed citizens of
Stanford. After all, these are the people
(with a few exceptions, e.g., Hammer
and Coffin) who have been elected
year after year.
Playing their game, I would only
note that this slate has as solid a pool of
expertise to tap as any other. Our ad
visers are clearly superior. Among
others they include people on the
nominations, financial aid and other
committees. For instance they include
Mike Lopez, a former ASSU Senator,
COP candidate and business manager
of KSFX, San Francisco. He is cur
rently in his second year at the Stan-

ford Graduate School of Business, and
is as familiar with the ASSU and uni
versity structure as anyone.
Yet expertise is not the central issue;
any of the three main slates running
could do a competent job. We are a
slate that can be whimsical about an
election, and yet deliver the time and
effort to serve as your voice, sincerely
and without petty political con
straints. We are what we present to
you.
In closing, I would like to emphasize
that in addition to the ideas we will
steal from the other slates if elected,
we'd like your input.
Finally I suggest that you consider
our position statements, our attitudes,
the diversity this slate has to offer, and
the immediate things we could do for
you if elected.

Docters et al.

Speaking for Robert Docters, Leslie
Brettell, Larry Berz and myself (Peter
Hausknecht), I would like to register a
reaction to this year's Daily COP en
dorsement in favor of another slate.
That decision was not a surprise to
me; indeed, it was expected. The Daily
is merely continuing with its recent
tendency to endorse the slate that pro
duces the most specific platform. The
more issues contained in that plat
form, the better.
Note that a criterium of this en
dorsement is not whether the issues
are realistic or even remotely practical.
Sheer volume of proposals predomi
nates.
Some slates, in an effort to please
everyone, have put forth so many
proposals it grows absurd. For exam
ple I quote the Johnson slate's optimis
tic suggestion ". . . parental income
should not be a determinate of
graduate (financial) aid." That slate
may as well have opined that all

women ought to be gorgeous and the
weather constantly superb. Neither
goal can be realized, unfortunately.
The Daily endorsement dismisses
our slate as "uninformed." This state
ment is both true and false, depending
on what you consider "informed."
Obviously the Daily considers ASSU
politicos the only informed citizens of
Stanford. After all, these are the people
(with a few exceptions, e.g., Hammer
and Coffin) who have been elected
year after year.
Playing their game, I would only
note that this slate has as solid a pool of
expertise to tap as any other. Our ad
visers are clearly superior. Among
others they include people on the
nominations, financial aid and other
committees. For instance they include
Mike Lopez, a former ASSU Senator,
COP candidate and business manager
of KSFX, San Francisco. He is cur
rently in his second year at the Stan-

ford Graduate School of Business, and
is as familiar with the ASSU and uni
versity structure as anyone.
Yet expertise is not the central issue;
any of the three main slates running
could do a competent job. We are a
slate that can be whimsical about an
election, and yet deliver the time and
effort to serve as your voice, sincerely
and without petty political con
straints. We are what we present to
you.
In closing, I would like to emphasize
that in addition to the ideas we will
steal from the other slates if elected,
we'd like your input.
Finally I suggest that you consider
our position statements, our attitudes,
the diversity this slate has to offer, and
the immediate things we could do for
you if elected.
