# Endorsement surprises Heffalump
## 
### 
Alben et al.

The Heffalump and Woozle slate
was pleasantly surprised to receive the
Daily's endorsement (sic) for ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP). A quick
perusal of the editorial, however,
would have led many readers to miss
the gist of the Daily's testimonial.
For example, while discussing an
opposing slate, the Daily abruptly
changed subject, interjecting the fol
lowing praise of Heffalump and
Woozle: "The slate appears aware of
graduate student concerns and has
made implementable proposals even

without a graduate student on the
slate." Many readers may have misin
terpreted this ambiguous and stylisti
cally confusing transition.
The Daily also displayed its charac
teristic crypticism and subtle form of
understatement: "The Daily endorses
... he. .. ff. . . al. . . u ... m(p). . . and
... w . .. o ... o ... z ... 1E ..This
message was only discovered after
painstaking analysis by our team of
experts.
The discriminating reader would
glean even more rave comments by
reading between the lines of the Daily

text.
Take, for instance, the following il
luminating passage:
" (between lines 35 and 36). Such overt
compliments lead Heffalump and
Woozle to question the Daily's cir
cumspect and impartial reputation.
Frankly, we feel we may not live up
to their expectations.
(Alex Alben, Carl Danner, Rob Hol
brook and Ron Marryott are candi
dates for COP.)
