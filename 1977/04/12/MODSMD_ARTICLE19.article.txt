## Opinions Letters: COP slates' support 
### 
Jordan slate
The ASSU is a complex organization
of student services, money-raising pro
jects, and elected officials responsible
for representing the student interest to
the University community.
At the top of this structure sits the
Council of Presidents (COP), a group of
persons who must work with students,
faculty and administrators on a wide
variety of issues, including tenure, the
Honor Code, reform of the ASSU and
the ethics of University investment
policy.
1 feel strongly that the Jordan-
Larson-Henkels-Westly slate has the
ability to handle the diversified chores
of the COP, and that this group de
serves your vote on April 13-14.
Glenn Jordan is a graduate student
in anthropology who has been at Stan
ford for seven years and who under
stands the workings of the University.
This knowledge is reflected in the
campaign literature of the slate; their
goals stated therein are indeed high,
yet feasible and well-conceived.
Greg Larson has worked tirelessly to
improve the Course Guide this past
year, and understands the issue of te
nure and teaching quality as well as
any student in the University.
Anne Henkels has proven her com
mitment to moving Stanford forward
on human rights issues through her
hard work on the J.P. Stevens issue.
Steve Westly has been a conscienti
ous member of the Senate for two
years. He has gained direct experience
working with ASSU finances by serv
ing on the Senate Finance Committee.
This slate has had a great deal of
experience working with faculty and
administrators, yet also has an excel
lent record on "student advocacy" is
sues. They will capably represent the
views of graduate, minority and
women students, groups which have
often been ignored in ASSU politics.
Jordan et al. have proven through
their previous efforts that they have
the experience and conviction to do an
excellent job in the Council of Presi
dents. A vote for this slate will insure
the ASSU the high-quality leadership
it must have if it is to be an effective
organization.

Johnson slate
After a careful consideration of the
campaign literature and the
background of each candidate, I have
decided to support the Johnson-
Nyegaard-Furtner-Krevoy slate for
COP. There are several reasons which
have led me to this conclusion, and I

would like to share some of them with
my fellow Stanford students.
First, the Johnson slate seems to
bring together a variety of political
perspectives. As such, they should
prove to be much more open-minded
than their primary opponents, the Jor
dan slate.
Greg Larson of that slate led off their
comments in the Daily by stating that
they had erroneously "gotten cast into
a mold as a radical slate." 1 would
submit that anyone at all familiar with
the track records of Glenn Jordan and
Anne Henkels would find that the
"radical" epithet fits the Jordan slate
nicely. In my opinion the Johnson slate
would be more likely to compromise
and get things done, rather than
polarize the issues and achieve no
thing.
Secondly, I am extremely dubious of
the Jordan slate's campaign promises
to fraternities. Here is a slate which
claims to be the only group qualified to
represent graduate students. The im
plication is that only members of a
given constituency can represent that
constituency on the COP.
Yet, at the same time that it is ac
tively courting fraternity support, the
Jordan slate has no fraternity members
on it. One can only wonder if its over

tures to the fraternities are not just
empty promises.
Thirdly, since the Jordan slate has
been determined to make Brad krevoy
an issue, I feel that a few comments
about him are in order. Everyone
knows that 1 have been a vocal critic of
Krevoy in the past. However, 1 do
know that he is hard working, well
informed, open minded and con
cerned. I think these qualities are good
credentials.
Fourthly, the Johnson slate has best
emphasized the most important issue
in the campaign: communication. The
ASSU government is far too isolated
from the average Stanford student. We
need more information flow into, and
out of the ASSU governmental struc
ture far more than we need new pro
jects for student politicians to run. The
Johnson slate has recognized this
problem and has assigned highest
priority to it, and that constitutes a
great step forward.
In short, the Johnson-Nyegaard-
Furtner-Krevoy slate can truly com
bine student services with active lead
ership, and in addition, work to bring
the ASSU government closer to the
students.
