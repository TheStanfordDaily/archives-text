# S. African holdings in question
## Trustees to contemplate stock 
### Mike Charlson 
The Board of Trustees will consider
today a recommendation to abstain on
shareholder proposals of six corpora
tions which call for either a
moratorium on new investments or a
withdrawal of present investments
from South Africa, according to Direc
tor of Finance Rodney Adams.
The proposal was approved yester
day by the board's Committee on In
vestments meeting at the board offices
in San Francisco. The full board meets
today at the Center for Educational Re
search here.
The committee recommendation
stems from work by the Commission

for Investment Responsibility (CIR)
performed at a two-hour meeting held
Saturday.
At that meeting, CIR members, in a
split decision, forwarded to Vice Pres
ident for Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger a recommendation to abs
tain on shareholder proposals of six
corporations with investments in
South Africa, according to CIR Chair
man Henry Rowen, a professor in the
Craduate School of Business.
The proposals call for an end to new
investment in that country or complete
withdrawal from present investment
there.
The recommendation also included

a provision for sending a letter to each
corporation explaining the reasons for
the action, according to Rowen.
Corporation, proxies im olved in me
proposal include Ford Motor Com
pany, General Electric, Standard Oil of
California, Texaco, Phelps Dodge and
Union Carbide, according to Au
gsburger.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber, which
also has South African investments,
had similar shareholder proposals on
its proxy, but that company's annual
meeting was held before the Univer
sity could take action, Augsburger
said.
The University abstained on the

Goodyear vote, but Augsburger said a
letter explaining Stanford's position
on the matter will be dratted if the
board so instructs.
CIR members were divided in their
decision to recommend abstentions on
the proxies. Of the seven committee
members, said Rowen, four voted to
abstain, two urged a vote against the
proposals, and one voted to support
the shareholder proposals.
Overall, "we regard this as a com
plex set of issues," said Rowen.
He said the commission decided to
abstain after examining three basic
areas:
— What would the prudent investor
do?;
— Are the American corporations
operating in South Africa exploiting
the blacks given the existence of the
repressive laws and policies of that re
gime?; and
— What is the effect of American
participation in that society? Are they
helping to reinforce authoritarians or
are they having a beneficial effect?
"This commission, as any commis
sion, has difficulty forming a hierar
chy of moral issues," said commission
member Lewis Mayhew, a professor of
education. This difficulty, he asserted,
helped lead to a vote to recommend
abstention.
The University owns 173,000 shares
ofGoodyear, 183,000 shares ofTexaco,
119,000 of General Electric, 59,000
shares of Union Carbide, 167,000

day by the board's Committee on In
vestments meeting at the board offices
in San Francisco. The full board meets
today at the Center for Educational Re
search here.
The committee recommendation
stems from work by the Commission

for Investment Responsibility (CIR)
performed at a two-hour meeting held
Saturday.
At that meeting, CIR members, in a
split decision, forwarded to Vice Pres
ident for Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger a recommendation to abs
tain on shareholder proposals of six
corporations with investments in
South Africa, according to CIR Chair
man Henry Rowen, a professor in the
Craduate School of Business.
The proposals call for an end to new
investment in that country or complete
withdrawal from present investment
there.
The recommendation also included

a provision for sending a letter to each
corporation explaining the reasons for
the action, according to Rowen.
Corporation, proxies im olved in me
proposal include Ford Motor Com
pany, General Electric, Standard Oil of
California, Texaco, Phelps Dodge and
Union Carbide, according to Au
gsburger.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber, which
also has South African investments,
had similar shareholder proposals on
its proxy, but that company's annual
meeting was held before the Univer
sity could take action, Augsburger
said.
The University abstained on the

Goodyear vote, but Augsburger said a
letter explaining Stanford's position
on the matter will be dratted if the
board so instructs.
CIR members were divided in their
decision to recommend abstentions on
the proxies. Of the seven committee
members, said Rowen, four voted to
abstain, two urged a vote against the
proposals, and one voted to support
the shareholder proposals.
Overall, "we regard this as a com
plex set of issues," said Rowen.
He said the commission decided to
abstain after examining three basic
areas:
— What would the prudent investor
do?;
— Are the American corporations
operating in South Africa exploiting
the blacks given the existence of the
repressive laws and policies of that re
gime?; and
— What is the effect of American
participation in that society? Are they
helping to reinforce authoritarians or
are they having a beneficial effect?
"This commission, as any commis
sion, has difficulty forming a hierar
chy of moral issues," said commission
member Lewis Mayhew, a professor of
education. This difficulty, he asserted,
helped lead to a vote to recommend
abstention.
The University owns 173,000 shares
ofGoodyear, 183,000 shares ofTexaco,
119,000 of General Electric, 59,000
shares of Union Carbide, 167,000
shares of Standard Oil of California
and 30,000 shares of Phelps Dodge, ac
cording to the University News Ser
vice. Holdings of Ford stock were not
immediately available.
The Board of Trustees will consider
today a recommendation to abstain on
shareholder proposals of six corpora
tions which call for either a
moratorium on new investments or a
withdrawal of present investments
from South Africa, according to Direc
tor of Finance Rodney Adams.
The proposal was approved yester
day by the board's Committee on In
