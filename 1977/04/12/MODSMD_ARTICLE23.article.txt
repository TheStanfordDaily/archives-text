# New York fiscal crisis far from over

### 
New York (AP) — Arthur Richenthal re
ceived a check from New York City yester
day for $823,252.01 — the relatively tiny
sum that threw the city into a billion dollar
financial crisis.
Richenthal is the lawyer for the Flushing
National Bank, the small'bank that won a
decision from the state's highest court dec
laring unconstitutional a moratorium on
payment of $993 million in outstanding
short-term city debt.
The moratorium was considered a cor
nerstone of the plan pieced together to save
the city from bankruptcy late in 1975.
Under that plan, anyone who owned short
term notes from the city had the option of
either swapping them for long term bonds or
wait until the city could pay them off.
The decision by the Court of Appeals led
to disputes with the banks and union pen
sion funds that had been the chief suppliers
of cash and finally to some financial "mira
cles," which produced money like the bibli
cal loaves and fishes.
'Repayment . . . happily*
"Repayment is going happily," said Comp
troller Harrison Coldin, "but you'll have a

lot of people writing in to dispute that."
Richenthal maintained, as he picked up
his check from the city's paying agent, that
"New York City indebtedness is now en
forceable and no administration can change
that."
In a broader sense, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Michael Blumenthal said "I don't by any
means think that the financial problems of
New York are by any means over. I don't
think they have been fundamentally solved.
"The problem is how to help them after
1978. We do think that they will somehow be
able to get over the period between now and
when the fiscal year starts."
Balanced budget
That's July 1 when the city must present a
balanced budget to continue eligibility for a
revolving federal loan of up to $2.5 billion.
That loan expires at the end of the 1978
fiscal year.
The treasury secretary, lunching with
New York Times editors, said that the basic
problems were welfare and the movement of
people and business out of the city into the
suburbs.
He pledged that "within a few weeks" the

Carter administration will come up with a
new welfare program that will bring relief to
the nation's big cities.
Better than Detroit
"It is in better shape than Detroit," said the
former chairman of the Michigan-based
Bendix Corp. "Why should anyone want to
live in Detroit."
The financial wheels set in motion by the
voiding of the moratorium led to a long
series of brinksmanship deals. The latest in
clude:
— The Municipal Assistance Corp. (MAC)
issued $400,675,000 worth of bonds paying
9.75 per cent tax-free interest. Holders of the
other debt averaging seven per cent tumped
at them.
— The sale of mortgages held by the ritv
brought in $410 million.
As it stands now, besides Richenthal's
money and the MAC] swap, the court has
authorized the city to pay back $52.2 million
to small holders of short-term obligations,
and the whole debt is expected to be paid off
by next fall.
