## modern dance/roberta sueda Utah Rep brings variety to modern dance 
### 
Utah Repertory Dance Theatre
came to Memorial Auditorium
last week to present its own
brand of modern dance with a
skill, innovation and diversity
which made for two strong per
formances. Friday night, espe
cially, RDT revealed a great vari
ety of styles, moods and themes
in eight pieces choreographed
by members of the company.
Consistent throughout the
pieces was a vibrancy, energy
and pureness of movement
which allowed for the clear de
velopment of ideas. In Synopse
Karen Steele and Michael Kelly
Bruce moved easily from sensu
ous motions unbroken by any
lapse in the vise-like control of
their bodies to volatile leaps and
explosive moments of conflict.
Kay Clark was a chameleon of
moods, actions and styles in
Spotlight, her energetic
changeability the driving force
behind this stream of conscious
ness style piece resminiscent of
the theatre of the absurd.
At the pinnacle of RIJT's suc
cesses in utilizing movement
and expressiveness was their in
terpretation of Steinbeck's Of
Mice and Men. Entitled My
Brother's Keeper, it was a com
bination of inspired choreog
raphy and the ability of Ron
Rubey, Martin Kravitz and Karen
Steeleto interpret the inneremo
tions, dreams and despair of the
characters in dance. The agile
grace and singularity of line
exhibited by Ron Rubey, the in
nocent strength of Kravitz, and
the sultry explosive dancing of
Steele combined to involve the
audience with the pathos of the
story on a gut level.
Through the use of something
other than instrumental music in
several pieces, RDT added

another dimension to their
dances. The reading of a poem in
Russian for Jews of Silence was
initially distracting but as the
piece progressed served to
further highlight the tension.
The sound effects of the
humpback whale, used in
Synapse, furnished the un
earthly haunting background
needed for that piece.
The lighting by M. Kay Barrell
was consistently excellent, serv
ing to underscore the themes
and changes of mood. In Spot
light it was an integral part of the

piecealmost to the point of being
a second presence onstage.
Unfortunately, the consistent
quality of the movement and
lighting could not totally com
pensate for some of the weaknes
ses. Many of the dances, notably
Dance from Photographs, suf
fered from being too long.
Themes and ideas in that piece,
though often initially good, such
as the old couple engaging in a
raucous display of sexuality, or
the identical twins exploring in
dividuality, were worn into the
ground and trampled by dancers

who continued with the same
moves and mood long after the
message had oeen conveyed and
absorbed.
Beneath the Heather attemp
ted to show what underlies the
conscious veneer of civilization
and spent too long in showing us
the dark side of our character.
Another fault was that some of
the emotional power was lost by
dancers who were too cool in
their movements. Linda C.
Smith in the Jews of SHence was
a stark figure, moving beauti
fully, but her too slick perfor

mance caused a loss of the de
spair and rage which should
have been present. Since dan
cers on tour perform the same
pieces over and over, the loss of
freshness in interpretatiaons
does occur, but some dancers
such as Karen Steele managed to
overcome it. Her anger in
Synapse and her sensuality in
My Brother's Keeper were con
vincingly genuine.
Only 10 years old, RDT was
described by one member as a
"hybrid sort of company" which
seeks to blend the creative ta
lents and energies of its dancers
to produce a mixture of modern
dance pieces from a variety of
choreographers. It is a rarity
among dance companies in that
it has no strong artistic director
who determines the style and di
rection of the works performed.
Rather each of the 12 dancers has
an equal voice in determining
the schedule, structure and
which pieces are to be kept in the
repertoire and performed. This
"democratic" system has al
lowed the individuals to fully
develop their talents and explore
new terrain in the art of dance.
These explorations resulted in
the great variety of pieces seen
by Stanford audiences last
Thursday and Friday.

Synapse, furnished the un
earthly haunting background
needed for that piece.
The lighting by M. Kay Barrell
was consistently excellent, serv
ing to underscore the themes
and changes of mood. In Spot
light it was an integral part of the

piecealmost to the point of being
a second presence onstage.
Unfortunately, the consistent
quality of the movement and
lighting could not totally com
pensate for some of the weaknes
ses. Many of the dances, notably
Dance from Photographs, suf
fered from being too long.
Themes and ideas in that piece,
though often initially good, such
as the old couple engaging in a
raucous display of sexuality, or
the identical twins exploring in
dividuality, were worn into the
ground and trampled by dancers

who continued with the same
moves and mood long after the
message had oeen conveyed and
absorbed.

the dark side of our character.
Another fault was that some of
the emotional power was lost by
dancers who were too cool in
their movements. Linda C.
Smith in the Jews of SHence was
a stark figure, moving beauti
fully, but her too slick perfor

mance caused a loss of the de
spair and rage which should
have been present. Since dan
cers on tour perform the same
pieces over and over, the loss of
freshness in interpretatiaons
does occur, but some dancers
such as Karen Steele managed to
overcome it. Her anger in
Synapse and her sensuality in
My Brother's Keeper were con
vincingly genuine.
Only 10 years old, RDT was
described by one member as a
"hybrid sort of company" which
seeks to blend the creative ta
lents and energies of its dancers
to produce a mixture of modern
dance pieces from a variety of
choreographers. It is a rarity
among dance companies in that
it has no strong artistic director
who determines the style and di
rection of the works performed.
Rather each of the 12 dancers has
an equal voice in determining
the schedule, structure and
which pieces are to be kept in the
repertoire and performed. This
"democratic" system has al
lowed the individuals to fully
develop their talents and explore
new terrain in the art of dance.
These explorations resulted in
the great variety of pieces seen
by Stanford audiences last
Thursday and Friday.
Utah Repertory Dance Theatre
came to Memorial Auditorium
last week to present its own
brand of modern dance with a
skill, innovation and diversity
which made for two strong per
formances. Friday night, espe
cially, RDT revealed a great vari
ety of styles, moods and themes
in eight pieces choreographed
by members of the company.
Consistent throughout the
pieces was a vibrancy, energy
and pureness of movement
which allowed for the clear de
velopment of ideas. In Synopse
Karen Steele and Michael Kelly
Bruce moved easily from sensu
ous motions unbroken by any
lapse in the vise-like control of
their bodies to volatile leaps and
explosive moments of conflict.
Kay Clark was a chameleon of
moods, actions and styles in
Spotlight, her energetic
changeability the driving force
behind this stream of conscious
ness style piece resminiscent of
the theatre of the absurd.
At the pinnacle of RIJT's suc
cesses in utilizing movement
and expressiveness was their in
terpretation of Steinbeck's Of
Mice and Men. Entitled My
Brother's Keeper, it was a com
bination of inspired choreog
raphy and the ability of Ron
Rubey, Martin Kravitz and Karen
Steeleto interpret the inneremo
tions, dreams and despair of the
characters in dance. The agile
grace and singularity of line
exhibited by Ron Rubey, the in
nocent strength of Kravitz, and
the sultry explosive dancing of
Steele combined to involve the
audience with the pathos of the
story on a gut level.
Through the use of something
other than instrumental music in
several pieces, RDT added

another dimension to their
dances. The reading of a poem in
Russian for Jews of Silence was
initially distracting but as the

further highlight the tension.
