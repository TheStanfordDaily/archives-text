## Enthusiasm key in 'Yankees' 
### 
The dorm play (or musical) as
a genre of drama has several
peculiar characteristics: for its
conception,planning and execu
tion, it draws upon the resources
of a random aggregate of indi
viduals who have litUe in com
mon beyond their residence; for
its production it draws upon
whatever talents, incongruously
large or embarrassingly small,
those individuals happen to
possess; and for its audience it
draws upon a captive and be
nevolent community eager to
avoid finding fault in gratuitous
diversion.
It is scarcely fitting then, to
evaluate the success of any par
ticular dorm production in the
same way less random dramatic
undertakings are judged; rather,
the sole appropriate criterion for
such an evaluation is the amount
of entertainment the play pro
vided for all involved, both ac
tors and audience.
On this basis, the Soto produc

tion of Damn Yankees earned
four stars from this reviewer.
The fairy-tale story of the
aging baseball fan who sells his
soul to the devil in exchange for
renewed youth, a baseball career
and a pennant for the
Washington Senators, originally
a book, later a Broadway success
and a popular movie, is well
suited for dorm production.
It was obvious from start to
finish that the high degree of en
thusiasm with which the
beyond-capacity (yes, there were
people standing in the cold out
side watching the proceedings
through the curtains of the Soto
lounge) Saturday night audience
responded was a natural result of
what must have been an
equally-high degree of en
thusiasm brought to the produc
tion by the participants.
To observe that the voices of
Tom Fullian (as Joe Hardy),
Karen Honey (as Meg Boyd) and
Amy Glick (as Lola) sometimes
took liberties with the songs of

Adler and Ross while Mark Mur
ray (as Applegate) and Pulliam,
in particular, manifested a cre
ditable acting ability is merely to
affirm, as stated above, that dorm
plays call upon various types
and sizes of talents.
Since a lively pace is the best
insurance for a well-received
dorm production and director
Jodi Ann Corwin saw to it that
the action never lagged, the pro
duction was a credit to all in
volved.
