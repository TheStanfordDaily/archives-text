techniques and workouts.
"My style and Powell's style
are not that similar," Buss said.
"One week I'd use the Mac Wil
kins technique, the next I'd use
the Powell technique and the
next week I'd use a cross bet
ween the two.
"Today I concentrated on
basic moves and returned to my
old style. I utilized my speed bet

said. Buss' toss brought him

Card half-miler Paul McCarthy hands the baton to anchorman Alan Sheats in Stanford's victorious
mile relay against Occidental Saturday. Sheats also anchored the winning 400-meter relay and
won the 400-meter dash in 47.3.
Versatile James Lofton won
three events and ran a leg on
Stanford's victorious 400-meter
relay to pace the Cardinal cin
dermen to a 90-64 defeat of Oc
cidental Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
Lofton leaped 25-4V2 to break
the meet long jump mark, then
sprinted to victories in the 100-
and 200-meter dashes. In his first
open 100 in two years, the junior
from Los Angeles strided to 10.7
victory in the face of a 10 mile
per-hour wind.
Lofton, undefeated in open
races this season, took the 200 by
beating teammate Marvin
Holmes to the tape in 21.0. Vete
ran Holmes also finished second
in the 100.
Stanford's dominance of the
sprints continued in the 400-
meter dash where junior Alan
Sheats led Card dashmen Gor
don Banks and Earl Gerfen to a
sweep of the one-lap race. Sheats
also anchored Stanford's win
ning foursomes in 400-meter
and mile relays.
Stanford's weightmen had
nearly as much success as Card

sprinters against Occidental,
capturing all three events.
Terry Albritton broke the meet
mark he set four years ago while
extending his school outdoor
mark by winning the shot put
with a 64-4 effort.
Buss finds form
Freshman discus thrower Rick
Buss, who had been unable to
find his form after the first meet
of the season, hurled a lifetime
best of 166-7 to lead Card platter
throwers Albritton and Doug
Greenwood to a sweep of the
discus.
Buss went to see former world
record holder John Powell sev
eral weeks ago for some tips on
techniques and workouts.
"My style and Powell's style
are not that similar," Buss said.
"One week I'd use the Mac Wil
kins technique, the next I'd use
the Powell technique and the
next week I'd use a cross bet
ween the two.
"Today I concentrated on
basic moves and returned to my
old style. I utilized my speed bet
ter," the Wisconsin freshman
said. Buss' toss brought him
within three feet of the Stanford
frosh mark held by Jim Howard
at 169-7.
Ricky Brown, a freshman from
New Orleans, threw 202-1 to win
the javelin. Last year's Louisiana
prep champ, Brown has won his
last three outings.
Although Stanford won the
meet by a comfortable margin,
throughout most of the competi

tion the Cardinals were anything
but comfortable about the out
come of the meet.
Lead see-saws
The lead \iacillated between
the two teams through the early
part of the meet and after 12
events Oxy rotted the score at
52-52.
But Tom
Shellworth blazed over the
400-meter intermediates to give
Stanford a three-point margin
that grew into the 26-point
spread the Cards enjoyed at the
end of the day.
Steve Crowley held off chal
lenges by teammates Roy Kissin
and Jeff Parietti to win the two
mile, insuring the Cards a vic
tory and furnishing Stanford
with its third sweep of the after
noon.
Saturday the Cards travel to
Berkeley to face defending
NCAA crown holder USC in a
double dual meet which also fea
tures UCLA against California.
The Cards last beat the Trojans in
1933.
