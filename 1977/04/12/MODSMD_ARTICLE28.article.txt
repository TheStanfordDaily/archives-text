# Stanford wins in 3 straight sets
## Card spikers defeat Cal 
### Stacy Geiken 
Despite injuries which
sidelined two of Stanford's top
players, the Cardinal volleyball
team beat California in three
straight games in Berkeley's
Harmon Gymnasium Saturday
night.
The Cards downed the Bears
15-7, 15-10 and 15-13.
Rich Yardley and Rod Fletcher
substituted for the injured Rich
Rand (torn ligaments in left
ankle) and Wendell Birkhofer
(low-back injury).

Both Yardley and Fletcher
played "very well" throughout
the match according to Card
coach Art Lambert.
The Cards were impressive in
the first two games, but Cal's ef
ficient passing forced the Cards
to temporarily yield the lead in
the final game. The Cards were
down, 9-13, before they started
their comeback.
Consistency
Consistent playing on the part
of Andy Fishburn and Tom
Duralde helped the Cards cinch
the game.
Lambert said he was pleased
with the win.
"We were playing well as a
team," he said.
Lambert said he hopes that
Birkhofer and Rand will heal in
time for the Conference Champ
ionships on April 22 because
their absence "hurt our offense"
on certain rotations.
"One rotation seemed to last
forever," he said.
Long weekend
The Card's win against Cal
was part of another grueling
three-game weekend (last week
the Cards met and defeated
Chico, Santa Clara and Loyola).
On Thursday night the Cards
played host to Cal Poly-SLO and
on Friday, the tough Olympic
Club of San Francisco.
It took the Cards four games to
defeat the high-spirited Cal Poly
team, 15-13, 10-15, 15-12 and
16-14.
From the first volley it was ap
parent that the Cards had their
work cut out for them.

Stanford trailed, 2-7, in the
first game but Duralde's well
placed spikes put the Cards re
peatedly on the scoreboard.
In the third game Charlie Cos
grove made the winning block to
give the Cards a 2-1 game edge.
By the fourth game both teams
looked slightly fatigued but
Stanford's depth allowed it to
make effective substitutions to
win, 16-14.
'New look Cards'
Card hitter Rod Fletcher said
that their new offense helped the
Cards win.
"Now we can fill in the weak
nesses of the other man,"
Fletcher said.
Stanford's new offense could
not defeat the more experienced
Olympic Club, however, as the
Cards lost in a five-game, two
hour-plus match Friday night.
The Cards won the first two
games, 15-9 and 15-5. The high
light was a game-winning ace by
Fishburn in the second game.
Strong comeback
Stanford was unable to stop
the Olympic Club comeback as
they won the next three games
12-15, 9-15 and 13-15.
Stanford became "a little over
confident" after winning the
first two games, Duralde said.
"1 think we underestimated
their potential," he said.
Duralde added that because
the Olympic Club is not a college
team the match will have little
effect on Stanford's chances for
NCAA regional selection.
"It would have been nice to
beat them, though," he added.

the game.
Lambert said he was pleased
with the win.
"We were playing well as a
team," he said.
Lambert said he hopes that
Birkhofer and Rand will heal in
time for the Conference Champ
ionships on April 22 because
their absence "hurt our offense"
on certain rotations.
"One rotation seemed to last
forever," he said.
Long weekend
The Card's win against Cal
was part of another grueling
three-game weekend (last week
the Cards met and defeated
Chico, Santa Clara and Loyola).
On Thursday night the Cards
played host to Cal Poly-SLO and
on Friday, the tough Olympic
Club of San Francisco.
It took the Cards four games to
defeat the high-spirited Cal Poly
team, 15-13, 10-15, 15-12 and
16-14.
From the first volley it was ap
parent that the Cards had their
work cut out for them.

Stanford trailed, 2-7, in the
first game but Duralde's well
placed spikes put the Cards re
peatedly on the scoreboard.
In the third game Charlie Cos
grove made the winning block to
give the Cards a 2-1 game edge.
By the fourth game both teams
looked slightly fatigued but
Stanford's depth allowed it to
make effective substitutions to
win, 16-14.
'New look Cards'
Card hitter Rod Fletcher said
that their new offense helped the
Cards win.
"Now we can fill in the weak
nesses of the other man,"
Fletcher said.
Stanford's new offense could
not defeat the more experienced
Olympic Club, however, as the
Cards lost in a five-game, two
hour-plus match Friday night.
The Cards won the first two
games, 15-9 and 15-5. The high
light was a game-winning ace by
Fishburn in the second game.
Strong comeback
Stanford was unable to stop
the Olympic Club comeback as
they won the next three games
12-15, 9-15 and 13-15.
Stanford became "a little over
confident" after winning the
first two games, Duralde said.
"1 think we underestimated
their potential," he said.
Duralde added that because
the Olympic Club is not a college
team the match will have little
effect on Stanford's chances for
NCAA regional selection.
"It would have been nice to
beat them, though," he added.
Despite injuries which
sidelined two of Stanford's top
players, the Cardinal volleyball
team beat California in three
straight games in Berkeley's
Harmon Gymnasium Saturday
night.
The Cards downed the Bears
15-7, 15-10 and 15-13.
Rich Yardley and Rod Fletcher
substituted for the injured Rich
Rand (torn ligaments in left
ankle) and Wendell Birkhofer
(low-back injury).

Both Yardley and Fletcher
played "very well" throughout
the match according to Card
coach Art Lambert.
The Cards were impressive in
the first two games, but Cal's ef
ficient passing forced the Cards
to temporarily yield the lead in
the final game. The Cards were
down, 9-13, before they started
their comeback.
Consistency
Consistent playing on the part
of Andy Fishburn and Tom
Duralde helped the Cards cinch
the game.
