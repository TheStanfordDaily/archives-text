# Benjamin is No. 1 man
## Walsh opens spring practice 
### Bruce Anderson 
"Forty-three. Set. Hup! Hup!"
"Three snap keys. Read those
splits!"
"Cover all passes linemen!"
The grunts and groans of con
ditioning and the crash and
crunch of shoulder pads and
helmets was somehow incon
gruous with the spring backdrop
Saturday behind Maples Pavil
ion as the Stanford football team
began spring practice under new
mentor Bill Walsh.

Walsh and his recently assem
bled staff brought more than new
names to the first day of spring
ball. There was a strong sense of
organization present that has
been somewhat lacking the past
several seasons.
Players and spectators — stu
dents and old-timers alike —
readily observed the change.
With no intention of receiving
an answer, spectators asked,
"They're really organized, aren't
they?"

This year's opening of spring
practice offered other differ
ences.
For the first time in what
seems to be a millenium but is
closer to four years the Cardinals
know who their quarterback is.
The right Guy
Walsh has left no doubt that
Guy Benjamin is his No. 1 signal
caller. Indeed, the cover of the
spring football guide pictures
Walsh and Benjamin kneeling
side-by-side in the middle of

Stanford Stadium.
Saturday, Walsh was seen
working with Benjamin and the
rest of the quarterback! ng corps
in between work with the tight
ends and the wide receivers.
As he did while at Cincinnati
and San Diego, where he built
potent NFL offenses, Walsh was
calling the offensive plays dur
ing a short nontackle scrim
mage.
Best in nation
While Walsh personally over
sees the offense, he has told Card
gridders that the new defensive
coaching staff at Stanford is the
best in the nation.
And perhaps it is.
George Seifert, who coached
at Stanford under Jack Christian
sen before a two-year stay as
head coach at Cornell, directs
the defensive backfield. Norb
Hecker, along with offensive
line coach Doug Single the only
returnees from last year's staff,
guides the linebackers. And
Fred "The Baron" vonAppen,
former defensive coordinator at
Oregon, is in charge of the defen
sive line.
Colorful coach
A never-ending stream of
energy, vonAppen and his color
ful, down-home language could
be heard all over the practice
field Saturday.
"Let's be quicker 'an a snake's
tongue . . . Holy bald-headed
Nellie! . . . Line, let's honker
down."
If vonAppen's voice holds up
the duration of spring practice it
will be nothing short of a mira
cle.
Spring practice sessions will
be Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays from 3:30 to 5 p.m. and
Saturdays from 9:30 to 11 a.m.
"Ready ... Break!"

energy, vonAppen and his color
ful, down-home language could
be heard all over the practice
field Saturday.
"Let's be quicker 'an a snake's
tongue . . . Holy bald-headed
Nellie! . . . Line, let's honker
down."
If vonAppen's voice holds up
the duration of spring practice it
will be nothing short of a mira
cle.
Spring practice sessions will
be Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays from 3:30 to 5 p.m. and
Saturdays from 9:30 to 11 a.m.
"Ready ... Break!"

Spring ball
Quarterback Steve Dils throws the ball under the watchful eye of new grid coach Bill Walsh (right)
during Saturday's opening of spring football. Walsh, who built highly respected offenses at
Cincinnati and San Diego in the National Football League, guided the Card offense in a short,
nontackle scrimmage during the 2 1 /2-hour morning practice session.
"Forty-three. Set. Hup! Hup!"
"Three snap keys. Read those
splits!"
"Cover all passes linemen!"
The grunts and groans of con
ditioning and the crash and
crunch of shoulder pads and
helmets was somehow incon
gruous with the spring backdrop
Saturday behind Maples Pavil
ion as the Stanford football team
began spring practice under new
mentor Bill Walsh.

Walsh and his recently assem
bled staff brought more than new
names to the first day of spring
ball. There was a strong sense of
organization present that has
been somewhat lacking the past
several seasons.
Players and spectators — stu
dents and old-timers alike —
readily observed the change.
With no intention of receiving
an answer, spectators asked,
"They're really organized, aren't
they?"

This year's opening of spring
practice offered other differ
ences.
For the first time in what
seems to be a millenium but is
closer to four years the Cardinals
know who their quarterback is.
The right Guy
Walsh has left no doubt that
Guy Benjamin is his No. 1 signal
caller. Indeed, the cover of the
spring football guide pictures
Walsh and Benjamin kneeling
side-by-side in the middle of

Stanford Stadium.
Saturday, Walsh was seen
working with Benjamin and the
rest of the quarterback! ng corps
in between work with the tight
ends and the wide receivers.
As he did while at Cincinnati
and San Diego, where he built
potent NFL offenses, Walsh was
calling the offensive plays dur
ing a short nontackle scrim
mage.
Best in nation
While Walsh personally over
sees the offense, he has told Card
gridders that the new defensive
coaching staff at Stanford is the
best in the nation.
And perhaps it is.
George Seifert, who coached
at Stanford under Jack Christian
sen before a two-year stay as
head coach at Cornell, directs
the defensive backfield. Norb
Hecker, along with offensive
line coach Doug Single the only
returnees from last year's staff,
guides the linebackers. And
Fred "The Baron" vonAppen,
former defensive coordinator at
Oregon, is in charge of the defen
sive line.
Colorful coach
A never-ending stream of
energy, vonAppen and his color
ful, down-home language could
be heard all over the practice
field Saturday.
"Let's be quicker 'an a snake's
tongue . . . Holy bald-headed
