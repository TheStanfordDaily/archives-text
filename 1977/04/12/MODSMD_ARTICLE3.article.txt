# Marguerite starts new bus route
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
In an effort to provide shuttle bus
service for persons not served by the
original Serra Street route, the Univer
sity has added another route to the
Marguerite's schedule, according to
Assoc. Planner Steve Schmidt.
Instituted a week ago, the new route
serves the southern part of campus,
with shuttles running from 7 a.m. to
midnight at 15-minute intervals.
Starting at Campus Drive and Serra
Street (across from the Shell Station),
the route goes up Campus Drive to Es
condido Road, then passes the Law
School, Tresidder, Terman Engineer
ing Building and the computation
center. The return trip follows the
same route.
The new route will continue ex
perimentally until May 6, when ad

ministrators will decide whether to
make it a permanent service, said
Schmidt.
"If we get enough riders," he said,
"we'll continue it."
Ridership
Last week's ridership level was ap
proximately 432 persons per day, or
1.2 passengers per mile, said Schmidt.
Although this figure is low, he said, it
is not as bad as it looks. Santa Clara
County Transit, he said, averages 1.3
passengers per mile.
"Besides," he added, "it's only the
first week."
The Serra Street route boasts a
higher ridership level than the city or
county transit systems, averaging 1250
riders daily, or 5.1 passengers per
mile, Schmidt said.
The average cost per shuttle ride is

40 cents, said Schmidt, compared to
county transit costs of more than $2.50
per ride. Marguerite passengers pay no
fare, however.
Schmidt said the Serra Street route
is used mostly by graduate students
from Escondido Village and Univer
sity staff memb'ers riding the shuttle
from parking lot to office.
$12,000 more
The five-week experimental route
will add $12,000 to this year's shuttle
cost, which would total about
$130,000 without the new route,
Schmidt said.
If the new route is made a permanent
service, it would cost an additional
$100,000, said Bob Kallman, chairman
of the Parking and Transportation
Committee.
"It would just about wipe out all the
money we'd collect from the Univer
sity," Kallman said.
Currently, 45 per cent of the parking
and transportation fund (which con
sists of revenue obtained from the sale
of parking stickers) is used to pay for
the bus, said Schmidt. The rest of the
money, he said, goes toward parking
enforcement and administrative costs.
Shopping center
The Stanford Shopping Center, he
said, pays for approximately 30 per
cent of the shuttle's operating costs, an
amount that almost equals the cost of
running the shuttle between the cam
pus and the shopping center.
Schmidt expressed satisfaction with
the present ridership level. Although
he said he would like to have more
people riding the shuttle, he added
that he thought 1250 persons was
probably the maximum number of rid
ers inlerested in using the existing
route.
Ridership was much lower last year,
he said. "We finished the year with a
474 ridership level . . . because our
service was so sporadic."
The original ridership was high, he
said, but because the buses ran into
"frequent mechanical problems," the
service became irregular and ridership
dropped.
The University now owns four new
buses and rents two green-and-white
former Peninsula Transit buses when
the need arises,
This year's program is "better man
aged and better serviced, Schmidt as
serted. "There hasn't been an interrup
tion of service in seven months."
Schedules have not been distributed
for either of the shuttle routes because
the task "seemed to be a lot more trou
ble than the benefit received," said
Schmidt. He added that anyone wish
ing a schedule may obtain one in the
planning office Room 100, Encina
Hall.

The original ridership was high, he
said, but because the buses ran into
"frequent mechanical problems," the
service became irregular and ridership
dropped.
The University now owns four new
buses and rents two green-and-white
former Peninsula Transit buses when
the need arises,
This year's program is "better man
aged and better serviced, Schmidt as
serted. "There hasn't been an interrup
tion of service in seven months."
Schedules have not been distributed
for either of the shuttle routes because
the task "seemed to be a lot more trou
ble than the benefit received," said
Schmidt. He added that anyone wish
ing a schedule may obtain one in the
planning office Room 100, Encina
Hall.
In an effort to provide shuttle bus
service for persons not served by the
original Serra Street route, the Univer
sity has added another route to the
Marguerite's schedule, according to
Assoc. Planner Steve Schmidt.
Instituted a week ago, the new route
serves the southern part of campus,
with shuttles running from 7 a.m. to
midnight at 15-minute intervals.
Starting at Campus Drive and Serra
Street (across from the Shell Station),
the route goes up Campus Drive to Es
condido Road, then passes the Law
School, Tresidder, Terman Engineer
ing Building and the computation
center. The return trip follows the
same route.
The new route will continue ex
perimentally until May 6, when ad

ministrators will decide whether to
make it a permanent service, said
Schmidt.
"If we get enough riders," he said,
"we'll continue it."
Ridership
Last week's ridership level was ap
proximately 432 persons per day, or
1.2 passengers per mile, said Schmidt.
Although this figure is low, he said, it
is not as bad as it looks. Santa Clara
County Transit, he said, averages 1.3
passengers per mile.
"Besides," he added, "it's only the
first week."
The Serra Street route boasts a
higher ridership level than the city or
county transit systems, averaging 1250
riders daily, or 5.1 passengers per
mile, Schmidt said.
The average cost per shuttle ride is

40 cents, said Schmidt, compared to
county transit costs of more than $2.50
per ride. Marguerite passengers pay no
fare, however.
Schmidt said the Serra Street route
is used mostly by graduate students
from Escondido Village and Univer
sity staff memb'ers riding the shuttle
from parking lot to office.
$12,000 more
The five-week experimental route
will add $12,000 to this year's shuttle
cost, which would total about
$130,000 without the new route,
Schmidt said.
If the new route is made a permanent
service, it would cost an additional
$100,000, said Bob Kallman, chairman
of the Parking and Transportation
Committee.
"It would just about wipe out all the
money we'd collect from the Univer
sity," Kallman said.
Currently, 45 per cent of the parking
and transportation fund (which con
sists of revenue obtained from the sale
of parking stickers) is used to pay for
the bus, said Schmidt. The rest of the
money, he said, goes toward parking
enforcement and administrative costs.
Shopping center
The Stanford Shopping Center, he
said, pays for approximately 30 per
cent of the shuttle's operating costs, an
amount that almost equals the cost of
running the shuttle between the cam
pus and the shopping center.
Schmidt expressed satisfaction with
the present ridership level. Although
he said he would like to have more
people riding the shuttle, he added
that he thought 1250 persons was
probably the maximum number of rid
ers inlerested in using the existing
route.
Ridership was much lower last year,
he said. "We finished the year with a
474 ridership level . . . because our
service was so sporadic."
The original ridership was high, he
said, but because the buses ran into
"frequent mechanical problems," the
service became irregular and ridership
dropped.
