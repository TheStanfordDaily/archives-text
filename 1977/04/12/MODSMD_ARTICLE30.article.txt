Crew
Stanford's varsity eight shell
lost a disputed race Saturday to
USC when the Cardinals hosted
the Trojans and Santa Clara at
Belmont Shores.
With a 25 mile-an-hour wind
whipping across the channel,
the controversy began when
Santa Clara rammed the Card
boat 100 meters into the race and
again at the 250-meter mark. The
strong wind apparently blew the
Santa Clara shell into the Stan
ford boat.
Southern Cal won the 2000-
meter race in 7:08.5, while Stan
ford finished second, four sec
onds back. But a race official
who noted the interference or
dered the race rowed again.
The Trojan coach said their

schedule did not allow them
time to race again and (JSC left.
The women's eight, racing
1000 meters, finished third be
hind USC and the Oakland
Strokes.
Stanford's junior varsity eight
finished in a dead heat with
Santa Clara, both shells covering
the course in 6:44.6. The frosh
eight stroked to victory over USC
and Santa Clara.
Stanford entered two varsity
fours, the 'A' shell finished sec
ond, the 'B' shell, third.
