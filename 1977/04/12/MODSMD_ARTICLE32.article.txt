# Shakes image as a choker
## Watson wins Masters 
### 
Augusta, Ga. (AP) — Fairly or unfairly, he'd
been labeled "choker." He had the unhappy
habit of hitting precisely the wrong shot at pre
cisely the wrong time. The victories he had
scored were overshadowed by the ones he let
escape.
But former Stanford star Tom Watson, facing
a pounding challenge by the greatest player in
the game in some of the heaviest pressure sports
can generate, laid to rest forever any doubts of
his courage and tenacity in a brilliant triumph
Sunday in the Masters.
Inevitably, however, the question came up in
the wake of his two-shot victory over Jack
Nicklaus in one of the most thrilling of all the
storied chases over the hills and vales of Au
gusta National.
Watson, usually the most even-tempered and
placid of golf's sometimes mercurial stars, was
almost waspish.
"Does this end the choker image?" he was
asked.
"What do you think?" he replied. "You ans
wer the question."
It wasn't necessary. He'd answered it himself
in a gritty performance down the stretch that
left Nicklaus — apparently on the verge of one
of the great triumphs of his career — a beaten

challenger, scowling and frustrated.
"1 felt like it was one of those days where no
matter how much you did right, somebody else
was doing better," Nicklaus said.
"I knew what I had to do," Watson said. "1
had to make some birdies. I knew I couldn't
make pars and beat Jack. I had to makebirdies."
He did. He made seven of them, the most
critical of which was the go-ahead, breaking,
20-foot putt on the 17th hole.
It gave him a one-shot lead and the happy roar
it jerked from the throats of the gallery shook
even the mighty Nicklaus, standing on the 18th
tee.
"I heard the birdie," Nicklaus said. "All of a
sudden my strategy for the 18th was shot. I
wanted to go for the middle of the green. His
birdie sort of changed around in my own mind
what was going on. I hadn't planned on some
body making a birdie.
"My mind wasn't ready for it."
And Nicklaus bogeyed the last hole.
Watson, who collected the famed green jacket
to go with the British Open crown he won in
1975, finished his 72 holes over the flowered
hills of the Augusta National Golf Course with a
276 total, 12 under par.
