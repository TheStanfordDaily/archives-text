# Stanford nine plummets in Pac-8 pennant race as UCLA sweeps Cards
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
fell to 0-6 in league standings
after dropping a three-game
series to the UCLA Bruins in Los
Angeles. UCLA downed Stan
ford, 4-3, in the series opener
Friday afternoon and swept the
Saturday doubleheader, 8-6 and
5-4.
"It would be easier to take if
we'd played poorly," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
after the series. "We didn't play
poorly. In fact, defensively we
played very well. We just didn't
get the hits when we needed
them. UCLA got the hits and
they were big hits."
In the first game UCLA
freshman John Violette led the
Bruins to victory going 2-for-4
with four RBIs on a three-run
home run in the bottom of the
first inning and a solo home run
in the third. Stanford's starting
pitcher Rob Irwin failed to pitch
as effectively as hoped, going
only 2-2/3 innings before being
relieved by freshman righthan
der Larry Kuhn.
The first game of Saturday's
doubleheader followed a similar
pattern. After being tied 6-6
going into the bottom of the
ninth inning, a two-run home
run down the leftfield line by
UCLA junior Ron Roenicke
ended the contest. Pepe
H nojosa led the Cards' hitting
attack, going three-for-three but

that wasn't enough to hold back
the Bruins.
The final game started out
well for Stanford with the Cardi
nals jumping out to a 3-1 lead in
the first two innings and holding
that lead into the sixth inning.
Leading 4-2 in the sixth, the
Cards ran into pitching trouble
and two key base hits brought in
three runs for UCLA to put the
Bruins on top, 5-4.
According to Marquess, the
home runs made the differences
in the three games as well as two
of the three games Stanford
dropped a week ago to USC.
LJCLA pounded six home runs in
the three-game series while
Stanford had none.
Though the Cardinals aren't
out of the running for a division
title, it's going to be tough to
come back.
"We're just going to take the
games one at a time now and
play the best we can," stated
Marquess.
Both USC and UCLA, unde
feated in league play, still have
to come to Stanford for three
game series in the upcoming
month.

going into the bottom of the
ninth inning, a two-run home
run down the leftfield line by
UCLA junior Ron Roenicke
ended the contest. Pepe
H nojosa led the Cards' hitting
attack, going three-for-three but

that wasn't enough to hold back
the Bruins.
The final game started out
well for Stanford with the Cardi
nals jumping out to a 3-1 lead in
the first two innings and holding
that lead into the sixth inning.
Leading 4-2 in the sixth, the
Cards ran into pitching trouble
and two key base hits brought in
three runs for UCLA to put the
Bruins on top, 5-4.
According to Marquess, the
home runs made the differences
in the three games as well as two
of the three games Stanford
dropped a week ago to USC.
LJCLA pounded six home runs in
the three-game series while
Stanford had none.
Though the Cardinals aren't
out of the running for a division
title, it's going to be tough to
come back.
"We're just going to take the
games one at a time now and
play the best we can," stated
Marquess.
Both USC and UCLA, unde
feated in league play, still have
to come to Stanford for three
game series in the upcoming
month.

The Stanford baseball team
fell to 0-6 in league standings
after dropping a three-game
series to the UCLA Bruins in Los
Angeles. UCLA downed Stan
ford, 4-3, in the series opener
Friday afternoon and swept the
Saturday doubleheader, 8-6 and
5-4.
"It would be easier to take if
we'd played poorly," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
after the series. "We didn't play
poorly. In fact, defensively we
played very well. We just didn't
get the hits when we needed
them. UCLA got the hits and
they were big hits."
In the first game UCLA
freshman John Violette led the
Bruins to victory going 2-for-4
with four RBIs on a three-run
home run in the bottom of the
first inning and a solo home run
in the third. Stanford's starting
pitcher Rob Irwin failed to pitch
as effectively as hoped, going
only 2-2/3 innings before being
relieved by freshman righthan
der Larry Kuhn.
The first game of Saturday's
doubleheader followed a similar
pattern. After being tied 6-6
going into the bottom of the
ninth inning, a two-run home
run down the leftfield line by
UCLA junior Ron Roenicke
ended the contest. Pepe
H nojosa led the Cards' hitting
attack, going three-for-three but
