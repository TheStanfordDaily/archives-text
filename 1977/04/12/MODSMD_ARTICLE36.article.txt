# Speak softly and carry a big stick

Card outfielder Larry Reynolds carries a big stick every time he
steps up to the plate. Reynolds, who hit .277 last season as a
freshman, is hitting over .300 this season. The fleet sophomore
set a Stanford single season mark for stolen bases with 38 last
season and leads the Cards in pilfering bases again this season.
