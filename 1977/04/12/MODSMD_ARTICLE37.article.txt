Coast Guard seizes Soviet trawlers
Boston — The Coast Guard brought a Russian
fishing trawler into Boston Harbor yesterday and
controlled a second Russian vessel at sea as the
United States warned that continued violation of
its new 200-mile fishing limit could hurt rela
tions with the Soviet Union.
The trawler Taras Shevchenko arrived under
escort and flying the American flag at the Coast
Guard base yesterday morning.
It was the first seizure under the law which
took effect March 1, despite numerous reports of
other Soviet violations.
As lawyers from the U.S. attorney's office
began checking the ship's catch and records,
another vessel, the Antunas Snechkus, a refriger
ated transport ship, was ordered to go to Boston
after a Coast Guard inspection team said it found
seven species of prohibited fish in the holds.
A U.S. official said President Jimmy Carter
would meet today with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin to discuss U.S.-Soviet rela
tions. The official said he didn't know whether
the fishing regulations would come up.
By late yesterday, no charges had been filed
against the Russian vessels.
New England fishermen have accused the fed
eral government of undue leniency, and Carter
said Sunday, "We just had to draw the line
somewhere. We informed the Soviet Embassy
this past week we couldn't continue to release
them, that we had to enforce the law."
The Taras Shevchenko was seized late Satur
day for allegedly keeping about 3500 pounds
more than its quota of river herring.
Rabin fined; wife to stand trial
Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Yitzhak

Rabin was fined $1500 yesterday and his wife
was ordered to stand trial as a result of the illegal
American bank account that toppled him from
Israel's leadership.
Atty. Gen. Aharon Barak ruled, however, that
there was no way to grant Rabin's wish to step
down until after the May 17 national elections.
The elections threaten to end 29 years of Labor
Party domination in Israel.
Rabin admitted that he and his wtf e had tried to
cover up $16,000 they kept in a bank account in
Washington, D.C. in spite of Israeli laws forbid
ding such foreign deposits. He said last Thursday
he wanted to step down as soon as possible.
Rabin is currently heading a caretaker gov
ernment serving until the elections, which are
the result of a no-confidence vote engineered by
Rabin himself last December.
The Labor coalition picked Defense Minister
Shimon Peres, 53, as the man who would lead it
into the elections instead of Rabin.
Lawyers win freedom for Moonies
San Francisco — Lawyers for the Rev. Sun
Myung Moon's Unification Church won at least
temporary freedom for two young church mem
bers yesterday, but one of them appeared ready to
denounce the church after 2 1 /i weeks in her pa
rents' custody.
A three-judge panel of the California Court of
Appeal put a temporary halt to an earlier ruling
that had given the parents 30-day custody of
Janice Kaplan, 24, and John Hovard, 23.
Along with Hovard and Kaplan, the three —
Barbara Underwood, 25, Jacqueline Katz, 21, and
Leslie Brown, 24 — made up the church's "faith
ful five" named in a conservatorship ruling
March 24.

The five had been turned over to their parents
at that time by Superior Court Judge S. Lee Vav
uris after a 12-day hearing. Vavuris had ruled that
the young adults were "subject to deception of
artful and designing persons."
Handicapped activists supported
San Francisco — Rep. Phillip Burton threw his

ton.
Burton visited the fourth floor of the old Fed
eral building where blind, deaf and physically

until the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) moves to guarantee the civil
rights of the handicapped.

Sacramento teachers to strike
Mountain View — A terrorist group demanded
free utilities for the old and poor yesterday in a
communique claiming responsibility for an
arson fire that destroyed four Pacific Gas & Elec
tric Co. (PG&E) trucks yesterday.
The Associated Press was directed to a com

to the trucks, which were parked in an open lot, at
$80,000. There were no injuries reported.

Sacramento teachers to strike
Mountain View — A terrorist group demanded
free utilities for the old and poor yesterday in a
communique claiming responsibility for an
arson fire that destroyed four Pacific Gas & Elec

and ignited early yesterday morning.
The communique gave the utility 48 hours to

Coast Guard seizes Soviet trawlers
Boston — The Coast Guard brought a Russian
fishing trawler into Boston Harbor yesterday and
controlled a second Russian vessel at sea as the
United States warned that continued violation of
its new 200-mile fishing limit could hurt rela

The trawler Taras Shevchenko arrived under
escort and flying the American flag at the Coast
Guard base yesterday morning.
It was the first seizure under the law which
took effect March 1, despite numerous reports of
other Soviet violations.
As lawyers from the U.S. attorney's office

another vessel, the Antunas Snechkus, a refriger

after a Coast Guard inspection team said it found
seven species of prohibited fish in the holds.
A U.S. official said President Jimmy Carter
would meet today with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin to discuss U.S.-Soviet rela

the fishing regulations would come up.
By late yesterday, no charges had been filed
against the Russian vessels.
New England fishermen have accused the fed

said Sunday, "We just had to draw the line
somewhere. We informed the Soviet Embassy
this past week we couldn't continue to release

bers yesterday, but one of them appeared ready to
denounce the church after 2 1 /i weeks in her pa
rents' custody.
A three-judge panel of the California Court of
Appeal put a temporary halt to an earlier ruling
that had given the parents 30-day custody of
Janice Kaplan, 24, and John Hovard, 23.
Along with Hovard and Kaplan, the three —
Barbara Underwood, 25, Jacqueline Katz, 21, and
Leslie Brown, 24 — made up the church's "faith
ful five" named in a conservatorship ruling
March 24.

The five had been turned over to their parents
at that time by Superior Court Judge S. Lee Vav
uris after a 12-day hearing. Vavuris had ruled that
the young adults were "subject to deception of
artful and designing persons."
Handicapped activists supported
San Francisco — Rep. Phillip Burton threw his
political muscle behind handicapped protestors
yesterday, announcing plans to hold congres

Burton (D-Calif.) said he was joined in the ac
tion by four other San Francisco Bay area con

llums, George Miller and his brother, John Bur
ton.
Burton visited the fourth floor of the old Fed
eral building where blind, deaf and physically

The activists, though visibly tired, said they
will stick to their vow to remain in the building
until the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) moves to guarantee the civil
rights of the handicapped.

pupils in suburbs near Sacramento.

San Juan Unified School District involves a dis

Sacramento teachers to strike
Mountain View — A terrorist group demanded
free utilities for the old and poor yesterday in a
communique claiming responsibility for an
arson fire that destroyed four Pacific Gas & Elec
tric Co. (PG&E) trucks yesterday.
The Associated Press was directed to a com
munique by an anonymous female caller. The
communique, signed by the New World Libera
tion Front and hidden beneath a trash can in a
service station rest room, said the trucks were set
ablaze after gasoline was drained from their tanks
and ignited early yesterday morning.
The communique gave the utility 48 hours to
respond to demands that the poor and elderly
living on fixed incomes get free gas and electric
service.
Mountain View fire officials estimated damage
to the trucks, which were parked in an open lot, at
$80,000. There were no injuries reported.
The underground group has claimed responsi
bility for numerous bombings in recent years,
most directed against PG&E with similar de
mands

Coast Guard seizes Soviet trawlers
Boston — The Coast Guard brought a Russian
fishing trawler into Boston Harbor yesterday and
controlled a second Russian vessel at sea as the
United States warned that continued violation of
its new 200-mile fishing limit could hurt rela
tions with the Soviet Union.
The trawler Taras Shevchenko arrived under
escort and flying the American flag at the Coast
Guard base yesterday morning.
It was the first seizure under the law which
took effect March 1, despite numerous reports of
other Soviet violations.
As lawyers from the U.S. attorney's office
began checking the ship's catch and records,
another vessel, the Antunas Snechkus, a refriger
ated transport ship, was ordered to go to Boston
after a Coast Guard inspection team said it found
seven species of prohibited fish in the holds.
A U.S. official said President Jimmy Carter
would meet today with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin to discuss U.S.-Soviet rela
tions. The official said he didn't know whether
the fishing regulations would come up.
By late yesterday, no charges had been filed
against the Russian vessels.
New England fishermen have accused the fed
eral government of undue leniency, and Carter
said Sunday, "We just had to draw the line
somewhere. We informed the Soviet Embassy
this past week we couldn't continue to release
them, that we had to enforce the law."
The Taras Shevchenko was seized late Satur
day for allegedly keeping about 3500 pounds
more than its quota of river herring.
Rabin fined; wife to stand trial
Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Yitzhak

Rabin was fined $1500 yesterday and his wife
was ordered to stand trial as a result of the illegal
American bank account that toppled him from
Israel's leadership.
Atty. Gen. Aharon Barak ruled, however, that
there was no way to grant Rabin's wish to step
down until after the May 17 national elections.
The elections threaten to end 29 years of Labor
Party domination in Israel.
Rabin admitted that he and his wtf e had tried to
cover up $16,000 they kept in a bank account in
Washington, D.C. in spite of Israeli laws forbid
ding such foreign deposits. He said last Thursday
he wanted to step down as soon as possible.
Rabin is currently heading a caretaker gov
ernment serving until the elections, which are
the result of a no-confidence vote engineered by
Rabin himself last December.
The Labor coalition picked Defense Minister
Shimon Peres, 53, as the man who would lead it
into the elections instead of Rabin.
