# Communication major issue in COP slate discussions

"This is a campaign of personalities
more than programs," commented Rob
Docters, head of one of the three ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) slates par
ticipating in a debate sponsored by
KZSU last night.
Members of the Docters, Johnson
and Jordan slates spoke and answered
questions from the KZSU panel and
the Daily before an audience of about
25 in Cubberley Auditorium.
One of the issues most frequently
discussed was how to improve com
munication. While Johnson slate
member Brad Krevoy advocated
senatorial districting as a means of im
proving communication, Greg Larson,
a member of the Jordan slate, said "a
change in the constitution is not the
best route."
In reference to graduate student rep
resentation, Jordan slate members as
serted they could better represent
graduate student needs because Glenn
Jordan, a graduate student in an
thropology, is on their slate.
Larson said the Johnson slate's
proposed booklet, Graduate Ap
proaching Stanford, "does not go far
enough "
Response
In response to Larson's implication
that a slate could only represent an
interest group if a member of the in
terest group was on the slate, Johnson
remarked, "a black face doesn't neces

sarily mean the person is committed to
the black community."
Docters slate members concentrated
their discussion on their plans to im
prove the cost-efficiency of the ASSU
and the University in general. As an
example of the University's ineffi
ciency, Docters cited IBM's offer to do
a free study of the University's
decision-making process.
"For the last two years, the Univer
sity has been trying to decide which
administrator has the power to decide
whether to accept IBM's offer," said
Docters.
Docters defended his slate against

the criticism that its members were un
informed, saying although the mem
bers might not be personally know
ledgeable on all issues, they did have a
"resource poo! of informed people to
go to,"
krevoy criticized the debate saying
candidates had stooped to a "very low
level. It appears the two slates have
ganged up on the front runner instead
of concentrating on ways to improve
the living environment at Stanford."
Steve Westly of the Jordan slate also
said the debate dwelled on "too many
personal views and not enough on the
issues."
