# Bond denounces subtle apartheid

"Today's tragedy is both that things
remain the same, or worse, but also
that many believe them radically al
tered," said Georgia State Senator Ju
lian Bond of the black American's
status.
Speaking last night before a near
capacity crowd in Kresge Auditorium,
Bond contended that "the removal of
the more blatant forms of American
apartheid have made it easy for too
many to believe today that black
people are really equal and free.
"Nothing could he farther from the
truth."
Although the 1960s ushered in an
era of significant change — with the
number of poor decreased by 1/3, and
blacks gaining rights to bus front seats
and to integrated education — "the
decade of the 1970s has been disaster
again for the black people," said Bond,
a 1960s civil rights activist who is now
spearheading grassroots black politi
cal organization in the South.
Bond was liberal in his criticism of
the Nixon-Ford Administration,
which, he said, was responsible for re
versing this tide of change.
"The combination of the gratuit
ous gratification of the gross and the
greedy, the national nullification of

the needc of the needy, and the victory
of the politics of penuriousness, pre
varication, of pious platitudes and
self-righteousness swinishness signal
led an end to the progress made in the
19605," he said.
Bond stated that the picture of black
progress over recent years is "decep
tive . . . our relative condition has ac
tually managed to get worse.
"It is almost as though we were
climbing a molasses mountain dressed
in snowshoes, while everyone else
rides a rather rapid lift to the top."
Carter, Bond said, "has a mandate
from the vast army of poor who put
him into office." Last November, 91
per cent of the black population voted
for the Carter-Mondale ticket, provid
ing tfiem the victory in more than 13
states, the Georgia senator claimed.
Of the Carter Administration, Bond
commented that "this year's new faces
in Washington's high places seem
oddly reminiscent of those in 1961, as
if they had been 'born again' ju?t fo"
today."
However, he said that "the next few
years could be the years in which the
home of the slave becomes the land of
the free, but only if we can continue to
insist — in word and deed — that the
snail's pace becomes a race."

equal and free" during a speech in Kresge Auditorium last night. The current
black situation in the United States was Bond's theme during the Speaker's
Bureau presentation.
