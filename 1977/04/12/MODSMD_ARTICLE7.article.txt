# Speed (and morphine) killâ€”pain

Amphetamine, long shunned in medical research be
cause of its potential for abuse, can, when combined with
morphine, offer up to twice as much pain relief for surgical
patients as morphine alone, with fewer negative side ef
fects, according to a study by three University doctors.
Reporting in the March 31 issue of The New England
Journal, Doctors William Forrest, Bryon Brown Jr. and
Colin Brown, together with eight other researchers in the
Cooperative Analgesic Study Program, said nausea, labored
breathing and a loss of alertness, all byproducts of high
morphine dosages, were minimized when the morphine
sedative was supplemented with dextroamphetamine, a
stimulant, in 450 postoperative patients in veterans' hospi
tals across the country.
"It seems quite possible," the report said, "that clinicians
have overlooked a truly effective combination that comes
much closer than any existing single compound to offering
ideal pain therapy for this group of patients."
The drug could be used to alleviate many types of pain,
but Forrest said his study and recommendations were li
mited to otherwise healthy post-surgical patients because
"historically, that group of patients has not shown itself in
an abuse pattern."
Because patients receive on the average only three injec
tions for acute pain after surgery, they rarely develop the
tolerance or dependence on a pain relief drug that spells
danger for other types of patients, Forrest said.
Likely abusers
Arthritics and patients with severe back pain are exam
ples of patients most likely to abuse an analgesic, Forrest
said, adding that the compound has "no application in that
area" unless it can be made less potentially abusive.
Because it was administered in single doses with varying
concentrations of morphine sulphate and dextroam

phetamine, the amphetamine-morphine compound was
not studied for possible psychological or physical addic
tion, Forrest said. He did admit that "it's safe to say that it's
not less potentially abusive than either drug alone."
The drug's major contribution in pain relief is as a
groundbreaker for research with other drug combinations,
Forrest said, adding that the combination was previously
ignored because of social pressure against drugs with
"abuse potential."
Postoperative patients who need to resume activity as
rapidly as possible would gain most from a marketed com
pound, the report said, because the chances for respiratory
or circulatory problems could be reduced.
Older patients, not represented in the study group, might
suffer from longer-term amphetamine effects, Forrest said.
Although he said he anticipates no problems, he urged that
prescription of the pain-relieving compound be "very
selective initially."
Despite the drug's potential effectiveness, Forrest said he
does not foresee its quick acceptance into general use.
"It's got a very tough road ahead, with many hurdles,"
Forrest said, pointing to the dearth of available intramuscu
lar (IM) amphetamine as a pressing problem.
The Food and Drug Administration removed IM am
phetamine from the market four years ago, reasoning, For
rest said, that the drug showed "no indications for clinical
usefulness."
All further experimentation will have to be done in a
costly research setting, until the FDA sees fit to review its
1973 decision, a proposition Forrest said he sees as un
likely.
"What's exciting is that maybe this is the prototype for a
redirection in this area," Forrest said. "Let's find a drug like
amphetamine and morphine that doesn't have the abuse
potential."

lar (IM) amphetamine as a pressing problem.
The Food and Drug Administration removed IM am
phetamine from the market four years ago, reasoning, For
rest said, that the drug showed "no indications for clinical
usefulness."
All further experimentation will have to be done in a
costly research setting, until the FDA sees fit to review its
1973 decision, a proposition Forrest said he sees as un
likely.
"What's exciting is that maybe this is the prototype for a
redirection in this area," Forrest said. "Let's find a drug like
amphetamine and morphine that doesn't have the abuse
potential."
Amphetamine, long shunned in medical research be
cause of its potential for abuse, can, when combined with
morphine, offer up to twice as much pain relief for surgical
patients as morphine alone, with fewer negative side ef
fects, according to a study by three University doctors.
Reporting in the March 31 issue of The New England
Journal, Doctors William Forrest, Bryon Brown Jr. and
Colin Brown, together with eight other researchers in the
Cooperative Analgesic Study Program, said nausea, labored
breathing and a loss of alertness, all byproducts of high
morphine dosages, were minimized when the morphine
sedative was supplemented with dextroamphetamine, a
stimulant, in 450 postoperative patients in veterans' hospi
tals across the country.
"It seems quite possible," the report said, "that clinicians
have overlooked a truly effective combination that comes
much closer than any existing single compound to offering
ideal pain therapy for this group of patients."
The drug could be used to alleviate many types of pain,
but Forrest said his study and recommendations were li
mited to otherwise healthy post-surgical patients because
"historically, that group of patients has not shown itself in
an abuse pattern."
Because patients receive on the average only three injec
tions for acute pain after surgery, they rarely develop the
tolerance or dependence on a pain relief drug that spells
danger for other types of patients, Forrest said.
Likely abusers
Arthritics and patients with severe back pain are exam
ples of patients most likely to abuse an analgesic, Forrest
said, adding that the compound has "no application in that
area" unless it can be made less potentially abusive.
Because it was administered in single doses with varying
concentrations of morphine sulphate and dextroam

phetamine, the amphetamine-morphine compound was
not studied for possible psychological or physical addic
tion, Forrest said. He did admit that "it's safe to say that it's
not less potentially abusive than either drug alone."
The drug's major contribution in pain relief is as a
groundbreaker for research with other drug combinations,
Forrest said, adding that the combination was previously
ignored because of social pressure against drugs with
"abuse potential."
Postoperative patients who need to resume activity as
rapidly as possible would gain most from a marketed com
pound, the report said, because the chances for respiratory
or circulatory problems could be reduced.
Older patients, not represented in the study group, might
suffer from longer-term amphetamine effects, Forrest said.
Although he said he anticipates no problems, he urged that
prescription of the pain-relieving compound be "very
selective initially."
Despite the drug's potential effectiveness, Forrest said he
does not foresee its quick acceptance into general use.
"It's got a very tough road ahead, with many hurdles,"
Forrest said, pointing to the dearth of available intramuscu
lar (IM) amphetamine as a pressing problem.
