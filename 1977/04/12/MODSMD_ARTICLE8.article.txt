## Opinions Editorial Fee assessments 
### 
'Daily,' Band, KZSU, Legal Counseling Office —
YES
We recommend a "yes" vote on the $3 fee assessments for the
Daily, and KZSU, the $2 Band assessment and the $1 assessment
for the Legal Counseling Office (LCO).
These organizations used their money well in serving students
this past year and deserve to be funded for next year.
KZSU and the LCO rely on the fee assessment for virtually all of
their funds. Over 1400 students received essentially free legal
advice during the first two years of the LCO.
KZSU has provided the community with indepth public affairs
reporting and a forum for community opinion that cannot be
matched by any campus publication due to space constraints.
Without a majority of "yes" votes, these organizations could not
exist.
Throughout the year, the Band raises money by playing for
various alumni groups. It needs money from the students to reim
burse its members who travel east for major pre-season football
games. It strengthens our prestige when students at other cam
puses see our renowned, incomparable Band in action.
The Daily is asking students for approximately $30,000 and we
are negotiating with the University for about $14,000 in order to
build a healthy reserve fund.
It takes about $300,000 annually in typesetting, printing and
office costs to operate the Daily. We need a reserve fund of about
one-third that amount in order to freely run papers with a large
proportion of editorial copy and to experiment with new and
innovative editorial products.
Two years ago the Daily lost about $30,000 due to an increase in
paper costs and a slow advertising market. It could happen again
and the reserve fund would be substantially drained. Our reserve
fund is not secure now.
Some persons are willing to pay 20 cents an issue to read the
comics in the San Francisco Chronicle. We think asking the
students to pay less than two cents an issue for the Daily is not
asking too much.
Academic Organizations Board, program fee,
'Course Guide* — YES
We support the Academic Organizations Board and the prog
ram fee which both ask for $1 fee assessments on behalf of numer
ous student organizations.
The program fee has provided partial funding to numerous
campus publications and to minority student organizations.
The Academic Organizations Board, a new organization, repre
sents programs in academic departments and groups like
Stanford-in-Law which previously received funding from the
program fee.
We feel it is worthwhile to spend another dollar for organiza
tions previously covered by the program fee.
Having a centralized student voice on academic issues is impor
tant at a time when academic departments are threatened with
budget cuts and a convoluted tenure process. These academic
organizations will not be eligible for funds under the program fee
if the Academic Organizations Board fee assessment fails.
The Course Guide, like the board, is going to the students for the
first time for a $1 fee assessment. We feel the Course Guide has
greatly improved in the past year. It could be better if more money
were available to pay staffers to cover more classes.
Voluntary Fee Assessment Referenda — NO
We recommend a "no" vote on the two voluntary fee assess
ment referenda. It would be very difficult for student organiza
tions to find funding if fee assessments were made voluntary or
were eliminated. In fact, KZSU and the Legal Counseling Office
could not exist without a fee assessment.
Students can always get their $1 back now under the current
system. Fewer students would pay $1 under a purely voluntary
system, and organizations designed to serve students would suf
fer.
The referenda are not binding. However, a mandate in favor of a
voluntary fee assessment would be the first step in severely hurt
ing several organizations.
ASSU Guest Professorship Board — NO
We recommend a "no" vote on the $1 fee assessment for the
ASSU Guest Professorship Board.
This year's board does not seem very concerned about using the
money it has from previous years. There has been a large turnover
among the members of the board this year — in fact, some mem
bers don't know the names of the others.
The current board claims to have sent out invitations but where
are the replies?
By next spring the new board may be out of money, that is
assuming the board's $3500 is spent on a guest professor. When
students see results from the board then maybe they will be
willing to spend an additional dollar next spring.
