Burros
We would like to make it known that
the government has a plan brewing
that would break the heart of all nature
lovers and especially fans of Califor
nia's Death Valley. The government is
planning to kill all the burros, totaling
over 1600, in Death Valley.
The "government's reason is taken
from a Los Angeles Times article, say
ing that the burros "are impacting our
natural resources in Death Valley. We
would like to reduce them to zero,"
according to a Park Service ecologist.
The government's plan would in
clude trapping, shooting and leaving
the carcasses to "recycle" on the range.
The plan won't be finalized for a few
months.
Any action would be appreciated to
avoid this catastrophe. Send, as we
have done, letters to the Department of

the Interior in Washington or to any
representative in Congress.

Graduate dinner
Here's thanks to the organizers of the
dinner in Tresidder for graduate stu
dents last Wednesday night (April 6).
It was refreshing to have the opportun
ity to interact with students from other
fields around the University.
I hope more graduate students will
attend the dinner in future weeks so
that it may become a regular weekly
social occasion.
