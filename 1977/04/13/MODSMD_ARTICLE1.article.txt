# CPPC protest may bring filing of criminal charges

### Jim Tranquada 
Police and student protesters may
file charges against each other as a re
sult of police forcing their way
through a group of students blocking a
marine recruiter from entering the
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) yesterday.
Three public safety officers escorted
a U.S. Marine Corps captain through
25 students who were linking arms in
front of the center's back door. Another
officer opened the door from the inside
to let the recruiter in.
"We're going to present the case to
the district attorney. It's up to him to
decide what violations took place and
who to prosecute," said Marvin Her
rington, public safety director.
Charges
The charges may include assault
and battery and failure to obey a police
officer, Herrington said.
"We are seriously considering filing
charges against Mr. Herrington for the
assault he perpetrated against the
people at CPPC," a protester said. "We
are also considering other legal action,
including civil suits and out of court
complaints about the action of Mr.
Herrington."

Once the recruiter was inside the
CPPC, the demonstrators marched to
the Center for Education Research,
where the Board of Trustees was meet
ing. They chanted slogans protesting
the trustees' abstention on stockholder
proxies calling for corporate disin
vestment in South Africa.
CPPC Director Ralph Keller told the
Daily before the marine recruiter ar
rived, "We're not going to make any
attempt to force an entry by anyone.
What the police would do, I don't
know."
Herrington said later he did not con
fer with Keller before deciding
whether to force his way into the
building.
"The man (the recruiter) said he
wanted to go in. He had a right to go in.
He had an appointment," he said.
No passage
Herrington said he could not get
through the crowd.
"I asked the protesters to stand
aside, pulled my badge and held it
prominently," he said.
"The action of the police, notably of
Mr. Herrington, prevented us from
peaceably allowing the marine to en
ter," student protester Chris Coleman
said.
"No one heard Mr. Herrington call
for dispersal or tell us that we were in
violation of any statutes," Coleman
said.
Another student said students were
pushed together so closely they had no
chance to move because the police
tried to force their way through the
blockade from both the front and the
back.
"We were going to disperse if the
police told us to do so, after making it
clear why we were there," one student
said. "We assumed there would be
time to make a decision, and there
wasn't."
"I've seen protest before but nothing
directed at physically stopping us to
get something done," marine recruiter
Capt. Paul Kroeger said afterwards.
Noon rally
Initially, 200 people had gathered at
a noon rally, which had to compete for
attention with the junior class happy
hour and the sound truck of the Sterl
ing senior class officer slate.
During the rally, Stanford Coalition
Against Racism (SCAR) members John
Murao and Jill Nelson condemned the
University's "implicit advocacy" of
marine recruitment on campus and the
"insidious tolerance of racism" within
the corps itself.
Nelson, student representative on
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR), called for "support
by building a struggle against this
University's contribution to racism
and imperialism."
Nelson demanded freedom for the
Pendleton 14, the black marines ac
cused of criminally assaulting marines
who they thought were members of the
Ku Klux Klan. She also said the KKK
should be kicked out of the corps and

all racism in the military should be
ended.
She called for a halt to military re
cruitment on campus, the denial of
campus facilities to ROTC, and a "yes"
vote from the University on all South
African proxy resolutions.
SCAR member Steve Vettel em
phasized "the struggle in South Africa
and in the Marine Corps is the same
struggle."
"The only option we have is to make
it impossible for Stanford to ignore
us." Vettel said.
Graduate student Drew Wechsler
then explained how the demonstration
would work. One group of protesters
would "picket legally," while the sec
ond would stand directly in front of
the CPPC entrance to attempt to block
access to the recruiter should he at
tempt to enter the building.
Marching
About 125 chanting, clapping mar
chers, some carrying placards,
marched once around White Plaza and
then circled in front of the CPPC. A
small detachment gathered at the rear
entrance, where the actual confronta
tion took place.
A student who was standing directly
in front of the door said her hair "was
pulled and her glasses torn off her face
as she was violently seized by her chin
from behind and pulled intothe build
ing when the police began forcing
their way through the students.
The demonstrators in the front of the
CPPC joined those at the rear of the
building just as the police and the re
cruiter entered the center.
After denouncing the police for forc
ing their way into the CPPC the de
monstrators marched to the building
where the trustees meeting was being
held. Here they paused to consider
what action to take.
They decided to march into the
building in a quiet, orderly fashion,
four abreast. They would wait outside
the meeting room while two represen
tatives, Jill Nelson and Steve Vettel,
presented the trustees with their ear
lier demands.
Locked door
When the demonstrators arrived at
the door, they found it locked. People
standing near the door on the inside
refused to respond to the students de
manding to enter. A police officer
handcuffed the door handle. The stu
dents then drew back from the door
and sat down to await further de
velopments.
A few students managed to enter
through a side door. Anne Henkels
criticized the decision to lock the
doors and to deny the two student rep
resentatives access to the board meet
ing.
"By locking themselves in thebuild
ing and refusing to talk to students, it
reinforces the ivory tower and power
elite concepts," she told Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs.

three other officers, including Public Safety Director

the blockade. Both demonstrators and police have said
they may file charges against each other in connection
with the incident.
