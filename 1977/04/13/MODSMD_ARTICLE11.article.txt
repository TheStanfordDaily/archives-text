# Death penalty sometimes justified
## 
### 
The issue of the death penalty
should not be treated lightly, since no
one should forfeit his life without jus
tification. The question that must be
answered is whether the criminal's
right to life is outweighed by any of
society's legitimate interests. And in
certain instances, I am compelled to
find that it is.
The effectiveness of capital
punishment as a general deterrent,
that is, as a deterrent to the crimes of
others, is the major issue of con
troversy. It has been noted that "prima
facie the penalty of death is likely to
have a stronger effect as a deterrent to
normal human beings than any other
form of punishment, and there is some
evidence (though no convincing
statistical evidence) that this is in fact

so" (Report of the Royal Commission
on Capital Punishment, 1949-53, p.
18).
In addition, there are crimes for
which death can be the only deterrent.
As the Supreme Court noted in Gregg
v. Georgia (1976), "there are carefully
contemplated murders, such as mur
der for hire, where the possible penalty
of death may well enter into the cold
calculus that precedes the decision to
act." Given this prima facie case, the
burden should rest with the opponents
to prove its ineffectiveness.
Results contradictory
The major studies on capital
punishment which have been run are
conflicting. One by sociologist
Thorstin Sellin suggests that it is not a
superior deterrent — but it has been
criticized for not screening out other
relevant factors. On the other side, an
impressive study published in 1975 by
Professor Isaac Ehrlich, of the Univer
sity of Chicago, suggests that during
the period 1933 to 1967 seven or eight
potential victims were saved by each
execution. No solid proof exists either
way, but this is true for most forms of
punishment.
There is another form of deterrence,
that of specifically deterring the
specific criminal being punished.
Death results in a total incapacitation,
so that no more innocent victims will
suffer from the specific criminal. Soci
ety should be allowed to deal with eg
regiously dangerous criminals, who
constitute a continuing menace. For
example, in Pennsylvania, fiVe of 64
murderers released on parole between
1946 and 1956 killed again.
There are also cases where fellow
inmates and guards have been "stab
bed, bludgeoned and garrotted" to
death by inmates serving life terms. In
fact, one convict now in federal prison
has killed on three separate occasions
— both guards and inmates.
Eye for eye
Another justification lies in the
frankly retributive theory that
punishment is justified as a return for a
moral evil. Though frequently denig
rated as barbaric or atavistic, it is easily
forgotten that there must be a nexus
between the crime and the punish
ment. Otherwise, unbridled
utilitarianism would inflict punish

ment irrespective of guilt, so long as a
social good was served. Quite simply,
criminals must deserve the punish
ment they receive. Thus the "idea of
justice-as-desert is profoundly con
nected with the idea of civilization"
(William Buckley, National Review).
Crimes affect society, as well as the
victim, and thus are deserving of re
taliation by the community as a whole.
This retaliation should reflect the seri
ousness of the crime, i.e., "the revul
sion felt by the great majority of citi
zens for them" (Lord Justice Denning).
We cheapen life if we allow those
who deprive others of life to suffer
mere inconvenience. With the more
heinous crimes, can "society's revul-

sion be adequately expressed ... by
sentencing them to life imprisonment?
Their victims' lives were cruelly snuf
fed out, but confined for life they are
yet able to partake of many of the
human satisfactions so brutally denied
to the slain" (Professor Donald Zoll,
Arizona State University).
Is it unreasonable for the more out
rageous, and voluntary, activities of
the criminal to entitle society to de
termine that he should forfeit his life?
For example, on March 30, 1977,
Robert Biehler was sentenced to life in
prison (and will be eligible for parole
in less than six years). Biehler mur
dered a mother and son in 1966, an
associate in 1973, and, in 1974, as a
paid killer, murdered Carole Phillips
by pressing the gun deep into her ear
and eye and firing it. In egregious
cases such as this, society should be
entitled to decide that the criminal's
wanton disregard for life and human
ity endanger society, and deserve the
ultimate penalty.
The most serious criticism of capital

punishment concerns its dispropor
tionate impact on minorities and the
poor. This argument proves too much,
however, since it applies with equal
force to all other forms of punishment.
"The root causes of the higher inci
dence of criminal penalties on
'minorities and the poor' will not be
cured by abolishing the system of
penalties. Nor, indeed, could any soci
ety have a viable system of criminal
justice if sanctions were abolished or
ameliorated because most of those
who commit crimes happen to be un
derprivileged. The basic problem re
sults not from the penalties imposed
for criminal conduct but from social
and economic factors that have
plagued humanity . . (Justice Lewis
Powell, dissent, Fur/nan v. Georgia,
1972).
Another important point is that the
victims of capital crimes are dispro
portionately poor and minorities.
Though approximately 45 per cent of
the inmates on death row are black, 47
per cent of the victims in 1975 were
black (and higher in other years). The
failure to punish and deter murderers,
while blacks are being murdered at a
rate ten times as great as whites, is
discriminatory.
Victims first
Since it seems "more important to
spare victims than murderers," the
uncertainty over deterrence favors the
use of capital punishment. Society
must balance two risks. The first is that
the penalty is imposed and "you have
possibly lost the life of a convicted
murderer without adding to deterr
ence and thereby sparing future vic
tims."
The second is that "if you fail to exe
cute the convicted murderer and
execution would have had an addi
tional deterrent effect, you have failed
to spare the lives of a number of future
victims" (Professor Ernest van den
Haag).
Given the possible value as a general
deterrent, the potential lives saved by
incapacitating the particular criminal,
and the inadequacy of life imprison
ment in expressing society's revulsion
at the magnitude of some crimes, soci
ety should accept the first, and not the
second, risk.
