# Poverty hurts but luxury's dangerous
##

This article was motivated by Shan
non Blando's article about poverty
(Daily, Feb. 7). It is true that poverty is
expensive to both the individual and
the society. This was clarified nicely in
Blando's article. In this article I will
be concerned with two points. First, I
would like to attract attention to
another harmful aspect which could
exist in human societies, namely lux
ury, and the second point is concerned
with the correct way of treating human
problems.
Let me start by defining the terms I
am using. By poverty I mean a situa
tion where a human being is unable to
satisfy his basic necessities of life to
the common standard accepted in his
society. Basic necessities of life in
clude food, dress, residence, medica
tion, communication (for those whose
job requires it for example) and mar
riage for those who desire it and are
financially unable to have it. By the
term "to the common standard accept
able to his society" 1 mean new needs
which become so common that it be
comes indispensible or very hard for
individuals to live without it, like

telephones and cars in this society.
Luxury is more complex to explain.
Luxury is not synonymous with
wealth by any means. It means a situa
tion where a human being spends his
wealth on things which are far from
being needed on a regular basis, and at
the same time the care for wealth dis
torts the personality of that human
being in a way that makes him view
things and people through wealth
only.
Luxury manifests itself in many
forms, in the form of a person whose
wealth is the only basic goal of his life,
such a person does not care whether
the means he is getting the wealth
through is harmful to others. Another
form would be a person whose wealth
has killed any human feeling towards
other human beings.
Example of the first form would be
the owners of gambling and pornog
raphic businesses. It is obvious that
these lead to many problems in the
society. It is also very obvious that the
only goal of the owners of such proper
ties is to acquire as much wealth as
possible from these businesses.

Still you find such people making
use of such phrases as "personal free
dom" (even though absolute frppdom
does not exist in the realm of the phys
ical world nor in the realm of social
beings). And you find such people try
ing to convince you with fictitious ser
vices their businesses supposedly of
fer. (Remember I am talking about the
net service, whether it is more than the
harm produced.)
An obvious example of the second
form is the old colonialism in Africa
and Asia before World War 11. Other
manifestations of luxury would be
selfishness and waste of time and ef
fort. For luxury-loving people selfish
ness would develop to a limit harmful
to the society in two aspects:
a) Such people will be indifferent
toward the rest of the people in the
society who are most directly influ
enced by the problems of poverty.
b) They will not, naturally, care
about the poor people themselves and
will look at them with content â€” a
thing which will lead to more intense
poverty problems.
One last manifestation of luxury is

the fact that wealth sources in the soci
ety will be drained to satisfy the
luxurious goals of the luxury-loving
people while these sources otherwise
would be used to satisfy basic needs of
the poor; and thus reduce the influ
ence of poverty on the society.
The second point to which I would
like to attract attention is the fact that
human problems cannot be success
fully treated independently. The
human being is a single entity.
Therefore, the correct and
successful treatment of human prob
lems should take into account this fact
of interference and interaction of the
human needs.
Another obvious criterion for the
correct treatment of the human prob
lem is the necessity of understanding
where and how the needs interfere or
interact. In other words the necessity
of understanding the human beings in
an aware and accurate way. Whether
this is feasible for the human being
will be the subject of the next article.
