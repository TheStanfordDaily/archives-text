Six Books in Search of an Au
thor: The Collected Early Poems
of Ezra Pound, (New Directions,
$22.50).
In 1908 Ezra Loomis Pound, a
young American poet living in
Venice, published his first book,
a thin volume with the Romantic
Italian title, A Lume Spento
("with tapers quenched").
Four years later he published
his sixth book of poetry, His
postes, which he dedicated to a
doctor he knew in New Jersey
named William Carlos Williams.
The work published in these six
books was an amazing achieve
ment. In searching for his own
poetic voice, Pound had brought
Anglo-American verse from the
depths of late Romanticism to
the brink of modernity in a few
short years.
At last it is possible to follow
Pound on this creative journey
without burying one's self in the
stacks of a university library.
Pound's long-standing pub
lisher, New Directions, has
gathered all his early poetry in
one book.
While most of Pound's best
work was written after 1912, the
poems in this book show the au
thor developing from an ambiti
ous minor writer into a major
poet.
In retrospect critics have been
too eager to believe that Pound
knew where he was going at the
beginning of his career. Reading
all of his early work, one is temp
ted to assert that Pound was cer
tain of nothing except his own
genius. In 1908 he knew only
two things about himself as a
writer: he was going to write
great poems; but he had not writ
ten any yet.
A hard, clear voice
There is so much of interest to
write about in The Collected
Early Poems of Ezra Pound that
it is hard to choose one facet over
another. It is difficult to imagine
that Pound wrote these 160
poems in only five years. And it
is amazing to see the distance he
travelled in them.
In 1908 he spoke the dated
idiom of his contemporaries.
While he may have spoken it
more beautifully than most, it
was not his true voice:
Exquisite loneliness
Bound of mine own caprice
I fly on the wings of an unknown
chord
That ye hear not . . .
Yet a few years later he had
found his own voice â€” the hard,
clear voice of modern poetry:
Be in me us the eternal moods of

the bleak wind, and not
As transient things are - gaiety
of flowers.
Have me in the strong loneliness
of sunless cliffs
And of grey waters . . .
Therefore Pound was justified
in 1912 when he wrote the short
verse epilogue to his early books,
which remained unpublished
for 50 years because it sounded
too boastful:
I bring you spoils, my nation
I, who went out in exile.
Am returned to thee with gifts.
Another country
Perhaps for the ordinary
reader the real importance of
these poems is something very
different trom what critics have
so laboriously suggested, for
anyone who studies these poems
too long is in danger of missing
their point. One must not forget
what it was like to encounter
them for the first time. Like his
fellow exile, Wallace Stevens,
Pound did something very sig
nificant in his stateside books.
He created another world that
overwhelms the reader at the
very first glance.
Open their books and you get
dizzy. Extravagant names, exotic
places, bits of strange languages
all astound the eye. Spend an
evening reading either poet in a
random, undisciplined way, and
you are mesmerized. Don't even
read the poems. Simply page
through the book skimming ti
tles and sampling small bits.
There is no way to escape their
fascination.
Listen to a few of Pound's
early titles: Apparuit, Nils
Lykke, Van a, Hosa Sem piterna,
Li Bel Chasteus, Sestina: Al
taforte, Envoi. Surely these are
signposts leading us to another
country, the land of poetry.
How many adolescents read
ing Pound or Stevens found
themselves completely puzzled
by each individual poem, yet
still understood their collective
message? You must change your
life. Quit school, fall in love,
study Latin, go to Europe, do
anything, in fact, as long as it is
marvelous and exciting.
Imperfect
What did it matter if
academics cried that Pound
knew his dozen languages im
perfectly? Or that Stevens never
left his self-imposed exile in a
New Haven insurance firm?
They lived in a different world
and invited anyone who cared
enough to follow. It is why two
other poets of equal, if not grea
ter stature, Eliot and Frost, have
no such following.

Although The Collected Early
Poems of Ezra Pound raises
these general issues, it is ulti
mately a book for scholars and
admirers. The ordinary reader of
poetry will not want to go to the
considerable expense of pur
chasing it since almost all of
Pound's best early poems are av
ailable elsewhere at a fraction of
the price. Such completeness
has few advantages to a new
comer. However, anyone seri
ously interested in Pound or
modern poetry should at least
read, if not purchase, this vol
ume.

After the t'nibarassingly
shoddy printing of Auden's
Complete Poems by Random
House, it is a pleasure to see New
Directions print an important
collection of poetry so beauti
fully. While The Collected Eurly
Poems of Ezra Pound is not
sumptuously printed, it is an
exemplary book. The binding
will last a century. The notes are
concise and helpful. And as a
gracious touch, the title pages of
all the original editions have
been reproduced throughout the
collection. In this age of cost ac
countants it is reassuring to see
such principles still in action.
