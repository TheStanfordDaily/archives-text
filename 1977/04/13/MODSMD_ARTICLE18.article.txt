### 
Sacramento (AP) — A life
without-parole bill that suppor
ters view as an alternative to the
death penalty cleared a Senate
committee yesterday with help
from some backers of capital
punishment.
The Senate Judiciary Commit
tee sent the bill by Sen. Milton
Marks (R-San Francisco) to the
Senate floor on a 6-2 vote.
The vote came on the 10th an
niversary of the last execution in
California. Aaron Mitchell died
in the San Quentin gas chamber

of a police officer.
Since then, the state Supreme

death penalty laws.
Earlier this year the Judiciary
Committee approved a bill that
would reinstate the death pen
alty in California. It later was ap
proved by the Senate and is
awaiting action in an Assembly
committee.
Marks said he encouraged
death penalty supporters to back
his bill by stressing that it could
be an alternative to the death
penalty if lawmakers fail to over
ride Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s
promised veto of a death penalty
bill.
Brown announced in his State
of the State address that he
would veto any death penalty
bill that reaches his desk. Hesaid
he favored life imprisonment
without parole for some crimes
as an alternative.
The bill would provide a sen
tence of life without possibility
of parole for several crimes, in
cluding treason and several
types of first-degree murder.

They include killing a police
officer, murder-for-hire, killing a
witness to prevent testimony,
and murder committed during
the commission of several other
felonies.
Types of first-degree murder
not covered by the bill would
carry life sentences with the pos
sibility of parole.
