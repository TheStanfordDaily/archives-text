# Trustees decide to abstain on proxies
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
unanimously approved a recommen
dation from its Committee on Invest
ments to abstain on shareholder prop
osals appearing on proxies of six cor
porations which invest in South Af
rica.
The committee recommendation,
identical to a recommendation put
forward by the University Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR),
calls for abstentions on corporate
proposals calling for either an end to
new investment or withdrawal from
present investments in South Africa,
according to Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance Robert Augsburger.
The board action also asks that a let
ter of explanation be sent with each
proxy.
The board's other actions included
approving a general plant improve
ment program for next year and hear
ing a report on the University's new
energy management and conservation
program.
The South African investment
proposals grew out of CIR work com
pleted last weekend in a meeting at
which commission members, in a split
vote, recommended that the Univer
sity abstain on shareholder proposals
for the six corporations.
Protest
The board action was opposed by
125 persons who staged a peaceful
protest outside the Center for Research
in Education at Stanford, where the
board met yesterday.
The University holds nearly 900,000
shares of stock worth approximately
$40 million in the six firms involved in
the proxy issue, according to the Uni
versity News Service.
The board action is in keeping with
statements made by panelists last
week at a forum on University policy
regarding South African investment.
The forum, sponsored by CIR, fea
tured investment counselors and pro
fessors who agreed that stock dives
ture in South Africa should be "the
action of last resort."
Speaking with protesters after the
meeting, board president Peter Bing
explained the board's action.
"This is an issue on which reasona
ble people can disagree," Bing said. "I

don't think there's any significant dis
agreement about apartheid."
However, Bing said the board felt
withdrawal "could be more harmful
than staying and working for change at
an accelerated pace."
Improvements
In other business, the board ap
proved a general plant improvements
program for next year which will total
over $3.6 million.
Of that total, approximately $1.4
million will be funded through bonds
offered by the California Educational
Facilities Authority (CEFA) at prevail
ing short-term interest rates.
An additional $1.5 million will be
funded through reserves set up for that
purpose, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs.

Just under $700,000 will be spent on
energy conservation programs, paid
for through short-term debt. Energy
savings in the first five years should
cover the debt, according to a
background report supplied to the
trustees.
Additions and alterations to existing
steam, water and chilled water sys
tems for improved efficiency in heat,
fire control and air conditioning sys
tems are general headings for nine
separate projects to be funded by
CEFA. - .
Energy report
The board also accepted a report
from the Office of the Vice President
for Business and Finance on the Uni
versity's Energy Management and
Conservation Program.
The program, begun more than three

years ago, was designed to provide
trustees with a summary of the Univer
sity's energy situation and plans to cut
costs by conserving energy, according
to the report.
The report said energy costs have
risen "at a rate far exceeding the rate of
increase of any other element of ex
pense," with energy increases of 55
per cent and 42 per cent in the last two
years.
The board took no action as a result
of the report, but Rosenzweig said ac
tion in the near future is quite possible.
The board also accepted IBM's sec
ond $1 million pledge totheCampaign
for Stanford for establishing a Theo
dore Kreps Endowed Professorship in
the Graduate School of Business.

meeting, board president Peter Bing
explained the board's action.
"This is an issue on which reasona
ble people can disagree," Bing said. "I

don't think there's any significant dis
agreement about apartheid."
However, Bing said the board felt
withdrawal "could be more harmful
than staying and working for change at
an accelerated pace."
Improvements
In other business, the board ap
proved a general plant improvements
program for next year which will total
over $3.6 million.
Of that total, approximately $1.4
million will be funded through bonds
offered by the California Educational
Facilities Authority (CEFA) at prevail
ing short-term interest rates.
An additional $1.5 million will be
funded through reserves set up for that
purpose, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs.

Just under $700,000 will be spent on
energy conservation programs, paid
for through short-term debt. Energy
savings in the first five years should
cover the debt, according to a
background report supplied to the
trustees.
Additions and alterations to existing
steam, water and chilled water sys
tems for improved efficiency in heat,
fire control and air conditioning sys
tems are general headings for nine
separate projects to be funded by
CEFA. - .
Energy report
The board also accepted a report
from the Office of the Vice President
for Business and Finance on the Uni
versity's Energy Management and
Conservation Program.
The program, begun more than three

years ago, was designed to provide
trustees with a summary of the Univer
sity's energy situation and plans to cut
costs by conserving energy, according
to the report.
The report said energy costs have
risen "at a rate far exceeding the rate of
increase of any other element of ex
pense," with energy increases of 55
per cent and 42 per cent in the last two
years.
The board took no action as a result
of the report, but Rosenzweig said ac
tion in the near future is quite possible.
The board also accepted IBM's sec
ond $1 million pledge totheCampaign

economics and director of the Stanford

according to President Richard Ly

The $300 million Campaign for
Stanford is scheduled to end at the end
of April. Trustees were told that gifts
and pledges to the campaign totaled
almost $292 million as of March 31.
The Board of Trustees yesterday
unanimously approved a recommen
dation from its Committee on Invest
ments to abstain on shareholder prop
osals appearing on proxies of six cor
porations which invest in South Af
rica.
The committee recommendation,
identical to a recommendation put
forward by the University Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR),
calls for abstentions on corporate
proposals calling for either an end to
new investment or withdrawal from
present investments in South Africa,
according to Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance Robert Augsburger.
The board action also asks that a let
ter of explanation be sent with each
proxy.
The board's other actions included
approving a general plant improve
ment program for next year and hear
ing a report on the University's new
energy management and conservation
program.
The South African investment
proposals grew out of CIR work com
pleted last weekend in a meeting at
which commission members, in a split
vote, recommended that the Univer
sity abstain on shareholder proposals
for the six corporations.
Protest
The board action was opposed by
125 persons who staged a peaceful
protest outside the Center for Research
in Education at Stanford, where the
board met yesterday.
The University holds nearly 900,000
shares of stock worth approximately
$40 million in the six firms involved in
the proxy issue, according to the Uni
versity News Service.
The board action is in keeping with
statements made by panelists last
week at a forum on University policy
regarding South African investment.
The forum, sponsored by CIR, fea
tured investment counselors and pro
fessors who agreed that stock dives
ture in South Africa should be "the
action of last resort."
Speaking with protesters after the
meeting, board president Peter Bing
explained the board's action.
