Why aren't there any Stanford bookcovers
sold in the Stanford Bookstore? Most univer
sities seem to have bookcovers with the uni
versity logo. -A.A.
They may be hard to find, but behind cus
tomer service, by the typewriter repair door,
in the shelves under the graph paper, are
glorious red and white Stanford bookcovfcrs
just waiting to be purchased!

Now that we have the deGuerre pools, why
do the faculty and staff still have the exclu
sive use of Roble pool every lunch hour?
Why can't some lunch hours be open to stu
dents, too?
Roble is the only pool that is really acces
sible to the central campus, especially to
residents of Lagunita, Roble, Flo Mo, etc.
Now that the pool is closed on weekends (!),
there are only two days of the week that
students can swim during the hot hours of
the day, and if they happen to have morning
and afternoon classes on those days (which
is very likely, being students, after all), they
are out of luck.
I would point out that most faculty and
staff have cars, and therefore access to other

pools. Besides, we live here!
1 don't know why the pool is now closed on
weekends, but if water conservation is the
reason, then everyone, not just students,
should have to make sacrifices. -G.B.
The reason faculty and staff have use of the
Roble pool every lunch is "strictly tradi
tion," according to Wesley Ruff, chairmanof
Physical Education and Recreation.
For the past 25 years, faculty and staff have
had this privilege, and since the pool is so
small, it has been continued. Pool staffers do,
however, "try to get students in as quickly as
possible" after the lunch hour.
As to why the pool is closed on weekends.
Ruff said, "We feel deGuerre pool can handle
it." Another factor is economics, as costs are
rising by about 40 per cent for heating alone
this year.
Also, Roble pool is very old, and as Ruff
said, "Its days are numbered." A major re
pair three years ago cost much more than
was expected, and the next one might mean
the end of Roble pool. But Ruff said the Uni
versity would try to keep the pool open as
long as possible, because it serves the many

residents of that area of campus.
At present, if you can't swim in the pool
sometime during the week, it is probably due
to a class being held there. Ruff said that
recreational swimming is scheduled MWF
2-5 p.m.
If that doesn't fit into your schedule, you
might try the Claw. It's open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week!

Why are there so many different colored
seats in Kresge Auditorium? Is there u
method to this madness? -H.K.
Apparently not. I called Roger Cairns of
Facilities and Planning, and he told me, "As
I recall, it was basically an interior design
decision — to brighten — and give a little
color" to the room. Since the auditorium is
used for more than just lectures, it was made
a colorful facility.
Evidently they succeeded — you noticed.

I would point out that most faculty and
staff have cars, and therefore access to other

pools. Besides, we live here!
1 don't know why the pool is now closed on
weekends, but if water conservation is the
reason, then everyone, not just students,
should have to make sacrifices. -G.B.
The reason faculty and staff have use of the
Roble pool every lunch is "strictly tradi
tion," according to Wesley Ruff, chairmanof
Physical Education and Recreation.
For the past 25 years, faculty and staff have
had this privilege, and since the pool is so
small, it has been continued. Pool staffers do,
however, "try to get students in as quickly as
possible" after the lunch hour.
As to why the pool is closed on weekends.
Ruff said, "We feel deGuerre pool can handle
it." Another factor is economics, as costs are
rising by about 40 per cent for heating alone
this year.
Also, Roble pool is very old, and as Ruff
said, "Its days are numbered." A major re
pair three years ago cost much more than
was expected, and the next one might mean
the end of Roble pool. But Ruff said the Uni
versity would try to keep the pool open as
long as possible, because it serves the many

residents of that area of campus.
At present, if you can't swim in the pool
sometime during the week, it is probably due
to a class being held there. Ruff said that
recreational swimming is scheduled MWF
2-5 p.m.
If that doesn't fit into your schedule, you
might try the Claw. It's open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week!

Why are there so many different colored
seats in Kresge Auditorium? Is there u
method to this madness? -H.K.
Apparently not. I called Roger Cairns of
Facilities and Planning, and he told me, "As
I recall, it was basically an interior design
decision — to brighten — and give a little
color" to the room. Since the auditorium is
used for more than just lectures, it was made
a colorful facility.
Evidently they succeeded — you noticed.

Why aren't there any Stanford bookcovers
sold in the Stanford Bookstore? Most univer
sities seem to have bookcovers with the uni

They may be hard to find, but behind cus
tomer service, by the typewriter repair door,
in the shelves under the graph paper, are
glorious red and white Stanford bookcovfcrs
just waiting to be purchased!

Now that we have the deGuerre pools, why
do the faculty and staff still have the exclu
sive use of Roble pool every lunch hour?
Why can't some lunch hours be open to stu
dents, too?
Roble is the only pool that is really acces
sible to the central campus, especially to
residents of Lagunita, Roble, Flo Mo, etc.
Now that the pool is closed on weekends (!),
there are only two days of the week that
students can swim during the hot hours of
the day, and if they happen to have morning
and afternoon classes on those days (which
is very likely, being students, after all), they
are out of luck.
