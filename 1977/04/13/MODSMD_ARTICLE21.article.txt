In the Realm of the Senses
(L'Empire des Sens) portrays the
obsessively erotic affair between
a geisha and a tavern keeper
which progresses through mul
tiple variations of sexual experi
ence and leads, as a logical con
clusion, to the voluntary stran
gulation and castration of the
man, and the woman's ap
prehension four days later, wan
dering the streets in radiant
happiness, his severed genitals
in her hand. This incident, as re
ported in Tokyo newspapers in
1936, caused considerable con
troversy.
Proponents of equal sexual
rights felt that the woman sym
bolized the beginning of a new
era and was, in fact, an under
ground heroine. Others, of
course, argued that there are
limits even on the actions of con
senting adults. At the press sc
reening the audience responded
with unprofessional candor: the
men were visibly moved by the
castration scene and the women
were wondering how they were
going to review this movie with
out blowing their cover.
The film was written and di
rected by Nagisa Oshima, whose
previous films include Death by
Hanging and Boy. His style is
currently a synthesis of his per
sonal vision and that of his set
decorator, JoshoToda. Although
he claims indifference to poli
tics, he includes in his spiritual
family "all those who wanted or
want to change society and those
who wanted and want to change
themselves."
He dedicates in the Realm of
the Senses to Sada, the woman,
whose name is so popular in
Japan that simply mentioning it

raises "the question of the most
serious sexual taboos." Oshima
finds it "quite natural that a
Japanese artist would want to
dedicate his work to this mar
vellous woman."
The actors, Eiko Matsuda and
Tatsuya Fuji, are entirely con
vincing and natural. They unde
ract their roles, and are physi
cally beautiful. Their perfor
mance is particularly excep
tional when compared to the
quality of acting usually seen in
X rated movies where the actors
either are obviously trying to
disassociate themselves from the
experience or are attempting to
demonstrate exaggerated plea
sure in a style reminiscent of si
lent movies.
Critics hail the film as a
pioneering work, the first to deal
with eroticism in personal and
nonexploitational terms
(Charles Champlin, Los Angeles
Times), the first to succeed in
placing explicit sex in a serious
context (Christine Nieland,
Chicago Daily News). Naturally,
it was confiscated by United
States Customs officials before it
could be shown at the New York
Film Festival. (Winning the
Grand Prix at the Chicago F'ilm
Festival and the acclaim of the
cognoscenti elsewhere has de
flated the significance of this
event. Censorship no longer im
presses us, positively or nega
tively.)
The overall critical reaction is
that the film is a significant work
of art whose subject matter,
rather than style, is eroticism: "A
work quite without prurience, as
direct and pure in its expression
as an erotic drawing by Utamaro
or Hokusai . . . Complex, rigor
ous . . . Unique in the cinema as
the expression of a total erotic
passion (David Robinson, The
New York Times).
I would argue that it is, in fact,
prurient — obsessively in

terested in matters of a sexual
nature — but that this obsession
develops over the course of the
movie. The couple begins with
casual encounters, then elopes
to an inn where they proceed to
make love continuously, seldom
pausing to eat or allow the maids
to clean the room.
In the process of experimenta
tion they sample most
heterosexual and some lesbian
techniques, eventually arriving
at the one game explicitly for
bidden in The Joy of Sex: stran
gulation during orgasm. The
movie portrays a continuum of
sexual experiences ranging from
the relatively innocent to the
sophisticated and degenerate.
Most people will find the
movie erotic until the experi
ences cease to be those that they
can identify with — the eroti
cism exists for all, but the point
at which it ceases varies from in
dividual to individual. After
this, the movie becomes a
psychological study of obses
sion and is no longer sexually
provocative.
Emotional obsession, whether
in the spiritual romanticism of
Elvira Madigan or the specifically
graphic sexuality of in the Realm
of the Senses, ultimately, logi
cally, courts death: one must
choose between killing the emo
tion to rescue the participants or
killing the participants to pre
serve the emotion. The subject
matter of movies tends to focus
on the latter solution.
The comparisons between or
gasm and death are too obvious
to elaborate on. In the Realm of
the Senses treats death as a
natural by-product of sexual
play, a thing of no more impor
tance than any previous ex
perimentation.
The characters are apprecia
tive of life. It is obvious that they
love each other. If pain is in
flicted, it is done so as a stimula
tion; if death is inflicted, it is
done so as a culmination. What
is really remarkable about this
movie is not its sensationalism
but its lack of sensationalism.
The erotic atmosphere is de
veloped by particular cinematic
techniques: the sets are like Per
sian miniatures seen in a
museum of erotic art — a de
coupage of tangled limbs, cush
ions, clothes. The texture of time
is langorous and dream-like,
conveying that motionless prog
ress where time expands rather
than runs forward as one is
overwhelmed by mindless plea
sure.
The camera does not remain
focused on any one single aspect
of a scene but wanders from
faces to various parts of bodies,
much as sensations change as
the stimulus varies. Concentra
tion on any particular part of the
body would be limiting and the
camera appreciates the totality
of the erotic experience rather
than exaggerating specific focal
points.
There can be no doubt that this
movie is successfully erotic both
in subject matter and technique.
How one feels about this de
pends entirely on one's toler
ance for love as a spectator sport.
It may be the first time the sub
ject has been treated in a non
sensational manner by a master
of cinematic implication.

Tatsuya Fuji, are entirely con
vincing and natural. They unde
ract their roles, and are physi
cally beautiful. Their perfor
mance is particularly excep
tional when compared to the
quality of acting usually seen in
X rated movies where the actors
either are obviously trying to
disassociate themselves from the
experience or are attempting to
demonstrate exaggerated plea
sure in a style reminiscent of si
lent movies.
Critics hail the film as a
pioneering work, the first to deal
with eroticism in personal and
nonexploitational terms
(Charles Champlin, Los Angeles
Times), the first to succeed in
placing explicit sex in a serious
context (Christine Nieland,
Chicago Daily News). Naturally,
it was confiscated by United
States Customs officials before it
could be shown at the New York
Film Festival. (Winning the
Grand Prix at the Chicago F'ilm
Festival and the acclaim of the
cognoscenti elsewhere has de
flated the significance of this
event. Censorship no longer im
presses us, positively or nega
tively.)
The overall critical reaction is
that the film is a significant work
of art whose subject matter,
rather than style, is eroticism: "A
work quite without prurience, as
direct and pure in its expression
as an erotic drawing by Utamaro
or Hokusai . . . Complex, rigor
ous . . . Unique in the cinema as
the expression of a total erotic
passion (David Robinson, The
New York Times).
I would argue that it is, in fact,
prurient — obsessively in

terested in matters of a sexual
nature — but that this obsession
develops over the course of the
movie. The couple begins with
casual encounters, then elopes
to an inn where they proceed to
make love continuously, seldom
pausing to eat or allow the maids
to clean the room.
In the process of experimenta
tion they sample most
heterosexual and some lesbian
techniques, eventually arriving
at the one game explicitly for
bidden in The Joy of Sex: stran
gulation during orgasm. The
movie portrays a continuum of
sexual experiences ranging from
the relatively innocent to the
sophisticated and degenerate.
Most people will find the
movie erotic until the experi
ences cease to be those that they
can identify with — the eroti
cism exists for all, but the point
at which it ceases varies from in
dividual to individual. After
this, the movie becomes a
psychological study of obses
sion and is no longer sexually
provocative.
Emotional obsession, whether
in the spiritual romanticism of
Elvira Madigan or the specifically
graphic sexuality of in the Realm
of the Senses, ultimately, logi
cally, courts death: one must
choose between killing the emo
tion to rescue the participants or
killing the participants to pre
serve the emotion. The subject
matter of movies tends to focus
on the latter solution.
The comparisons between or
gasm and death are too obvious
to elaborate on. In the Realm of
the Senses treats death as a
natural by-product of sexual
play, a thing of no more impor
tance than any previous ex
perimentation.
The characters are apprecia
tive of life. It is obvious that they
love each other. If pain is in
flicted, it is done so as a stimula
tion; if death is inflicted, it is
done so as a culmination. What
is really remarkable about this
movie is not its sensationalism
but its lack of sensationalism.
The erotic atmosphere is de
veloped by particular cinematic
techniques: the sets are like Per
sian miniatures seen in a
museum of erotic art — a de
coupage of tangled limbs, cush
ions, clothes. The texture of time
is langorous and dream-like,
conveying that motionless prog
ress where time expands rather
than runs forward as one is
overwhelmed by mindless plea
sure.
The camera does not remain
focused on any one single aspect
of a scene but wanders from
faces to various parts of bodies,
much as sensations change as
the stimulus varies. Concentra
tion on any particular part of the
body would be limiting and the
camera appreciates the totality
of the erotic experience rather
than exaggerating specific focal
points.
There can be no doubt that this
movie is successfully erotic both
in subject matter and technique.
How one feels about this de
pends entirely on one's toler
ance for love as a spectator sport.
It may be the first time the sub
ject has been treated in a non
sensational manner by a master
of cinematic implication.

In the Realm of the Senses
(L'Empire des Sens) portrays the
obsessively erotic affair between
a geisha and a tavern keeper
which progresses through mul
tiple variations of sexual experi
ence and leads, as a logical con
clusion, to the voluntary stran
gulation and castration of the
man, and the woman's ap
prehension four days later, wan
dering the streets in radiant
happiness, his severed genitals
in her hand. This incident, as re
ported in Tokyo newspapers in
1936, caused considerable con
troversy.
Proponents of equal sexual
rights felt that the woman sym
bolized the beginning of a new
era and was, in fact, an under
ground heroine. Others, of
course, argued that there are
limits even on the actions of con
senting adults. At the press sc
reening the audience responded
with unprofessional candor: the
men were visibly moved by the
castration scene and the women
were wondering how they were
going to review this movie with
out blowing their cover.
The film was written and di
rected by Nagisa Oshima, whose
previous films include Death by
Hanging and Boy. His style is
currently a synthesis of his per
sonal vision and that of his set
decorator, JoshoToda. Although
he claims indifference to poli
tics, he includes in his spiritual
family "all those who wanted or
want to change society and those
who wanted and want to change
themselves."
He dedicates in the Realm of
the Senses to Sada, the woman,
whose name is so popular in
Japan that simply mentioning it

raises "the question of the most
serious sexual taboos." Oshima
finds it "quite natural that a
Japanese artist would want to
dedicate his work to this mar
vellous woman."

sion and is no longer sexually
provocative.
Emotional obsession, whether
in the spiritual romanticism of
Elvira Madigan or the specifically
graphic sexuality of in the Realm
of the Senses, ultimately, logi
cally, courts death: one must
choose between killing the emo
tion to rescue the participants or
killing the participants to pre
serve the emotion. The subject
matter of movies tends to focus
on the latter solution.
The comparisons between or
gasm and death are too obvious
to elaborate on. In the Realm of
the Senses treats death as a
natural by-product of sexual
play, a thing of no more impor
tance than any previous ex
perimentation.
The characters are apprecia
tive of life. It is obvious that they
love each other. If pain is in
flicted, it is done so as a stimula
tion; if death is inflicted, it is
done so as a culmination. What
is really remarkable about this
movie is not its sensationalism
but its lack of sensationalism.
The erotic atmosphere is de
veloped by particular cinematic
techniques: the sets are like Per
sian miniatures seen in a
museum of erotic art — a de
coupage of tangled limbs, cush
ions, clothes. The texture of time
is langorous and dream-like,
conveying that motionless prog
ress where time expands rather
than runs forward as one is
overwhelmed by mindless plea
sure.
The camera does not remain
focused on any one single aspect
of a scene but wanders from
faces to various parts of bodies,
much as sensations change as
the stimulus varies. Concentra
tion on any particular part of the
body would be limiting and the
camera appreciates the totality
of the erotic experience rather
than exaggerating specific focal
points.
There can be no doubt that this
movie is successfully erotic both
in subject matter and technique.
How one feels about this de
pends entirely on one's toler
ance for love as a spectator sport.
It may be the first time the sub
ject has been treated in a non
sensational manner by a master
of cinematic implication.

In the Realm of the Senses
(L'Empire des Sens) portrays the
obsessively erotic affair between
a geisha and a tavern keeper
which progresses through mul
tiple variations of sexual experi
ence and leads, as a logical con
clusion, to the voluntary stran
gulation and castration of the
man, and the woman's ap
prehension four days later, wan
dering the streets in radiant
happiness, his severed genitals
in her hand. This incident, as re
ported in Tokyo newspapers in
1936, caused considerable con
troversy.
Proponents of equal sexual
rights felt that the woman sym
bolized the beginning of a new
era and was, in fact, an under
ground heroine. Others, of
course, argued that there are
limits even on the actions of con
senting adults. At the press sc
reening the audience responded
with unprofessional candor: the
men were visibly moved by the
castration scene and the women
were wondering how they were
going to review this movie with
out blowing their cover.
The film was written and di
rected by Nagisa Oshima, whose
previous films include Death by
Hanging and Boy. His style is
currently a synthesis of his per
sonal vision and that of his set
decorator, JoshoToda. Although
he claims indifference to poli
tics, he includes in his spiritual
family "all those who wanted or
want to change society and those
who wanted and want to change
themselves."
He dedicates in the Realm of
the Senses to Sada, the woman,
whose name is so popular in
Japan that simply mentioning it

raises "the question of the most
serious sexual taboos." Oshima
finds it "quite natural that a
Japanese artist would want to
dedicate his work to this mar
vellous woman."
The actors, Eiko Matsuda and
Tatsuya Fuji, are entirely con
vincing and natural. They unde
ract their roles, and are physi
cally beautiful. Their perfor
mance is particularly excep
tional when compared to the
quality of acting usually seen in
X rated movies where the actors
either are obviously trying to
disassociate themselves from the
experience or are attempting to
demonstrate exaggerated plea
sure in a style reminiscent of si
lent movies.
Critics hail the film as a
pioneering work, the first to deal
with eroticism in personal and
nonexploitational terms
(Charles Champlin, Los Angeles
Times), the first to succeed in
placing explicit sex in a serious
context (Christine Nieland,
Chicago Daily News). Naturally,
it was confiscated by United
States Customs officials before it
could be shown at the New York
Film Festival. (Winning the
Grand Prix at the Chicago F'ilm
Festival and the acclaim of the
cognoscenti elsewhere has de
flated the significance of this
event. Censorship no longer im
presses us, positively or nega
tively.)
The overall critical reaction is
that the film is a significant work
of art whose subject matter,
rather than style, is eroticism: "A
work quite without prurience, as
direct and pure in its expression
as an erotic drawing by Utamaro
or Hokusai . . . Complex, rigor
ous . . . Unique in the cinema as
the expression of a total erotic
passion (David Robinson, The
New York Times).
I would argue that it is, in fact,
prurient — obsessively in

terested in matters of a sexual
nature — but that this obsession
develops over the course of the
movie. The couple begins with
casual encounters, then elopes
to an inn where they proceed to
make love continuously, seldom
pausing to eat or allow the maids
to clean the room.
In the process of experimenta
tion they sample most
heterosexual and some lesbian
techniques, eventually arriving
at the one game explicitly for
bidden in The Joy of Sex: stran
gulation during orgasm. The
movie portrays a continuum of
sexual experiences ranging from
the relatively innocent to the
sophisticated and degenerate.
Most people will find the
movie erotic until the experi
ences cease to be those that they
can identify with — the eroti
cism exists for all, but the point
at which it ceases varies from in
dividual to individual. After
this, the movie becomes a
