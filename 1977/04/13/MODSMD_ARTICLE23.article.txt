the week in entertainment and the arts as well as
discussions and lectures of interest to the Stanford
community.
Events listed occur both on the campus and in
the Bay Area.
Please send all notices by the Friday preceding
the week of publication to Spectrograph, The

Every effort will be made to include all notices
received prior to the deadline, but the Daily re
serves the right to edit "Spectrograph" according

tee that an event will appear.
