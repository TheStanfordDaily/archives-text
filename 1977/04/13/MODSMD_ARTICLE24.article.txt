## 'Carmen Jones' is Bay Area first 
### 
Carmen Jones retains the
music and conflict of Carmen,
but the lyrics and plot are
adapted to southern blacks dur
ing World War 11. Don Jose be
comes Joe, a corporal in the
Army assigned to guard the
parachute factory where Carmen
works.
She woos him with "Dat's
Love" ("Habanera"), and all
memories of Cindy Lou
(Micaela), his childhood
sweetheart, vanish. Joe's rival for
Carmen, the toreador Escamillo
in the opera, is Husky Miller, a
prizefighter.
The smugglers and gypsies
become members of Husky's en
tourage. Carmen Jones is killed
outside the prizefight ring while
the chorus sings "Stand Up and
Fight" to the tune of the To
reador Song.
Stanford's Committee on
Black Performing Arts will open
Oscar Hammerstein's ll's Car
men /ones, the black version of
Bizet's opera Carmen, this Fri
day.
A first
This production is the first
time Carmen Jones has been pre
sented by a Bay Area company.
"The committee was advised
against attempting such a major
production," says John Cochran,
producer-director and chairman
of the committee.
"However, we believed that
we were equipped to handle the
demands of Carmen Jones. The
committee was set up in 1968 to
give artistic expression to the ra
cial unrest of the sixties. The
tenor of the seventies might be
different as far as radical poli
tics, but the necessity for artistic
expression in the black com
munity still exists, and with this
production we hoped to expand
beyond the Stanford campus.
"Hammerstein spent nine
months in a nationwide search
for his cast. In 1943 there was no
place for blacks in opera. That
the committee can produce

Carmen Jones with the singers at
Stanford and in the Bay Area is
one indication of the advances
blacks have made in the per
forming arts."
One of the problems the cast
faces is capturing the mentality
and accents of southern country
blacks in the early 19405. Coun
try blacks were basic, earthy, un
sophisticated and cut off from
white society.
Country earthiness
The cast for Carmen Jones
lacks this experience of un
sophisticated country earthiiness
and alienation. Cochran has
done psychological exercises
with the cast to open them to
these feelings and to free them

from their sophistication. He has
also had to teach them the black
southern dialect.
Cochran sees Carmen "as a
free spirit born into a place and
time that don't match her. She
uses her charisma and charm to
get what she wants. Joe is at
tracted to her but his country
morals don't allow him to re
spond at first.
"Joe is a challenge to Carmen
initially, but once she captures
him, she moves on to someone
more sophisticated, Husky Mil
ler, the prizefighter. Carmen's
freedom is the source of her
charisma but also what makes
people reject her and what fi

nally leads to her death."
The set design by Jim Cully,
lighting design by Paul Murgat
royd, and costumes by Betsey
Roberts reflect this move to
tragedy. The show starts with
light and bright color that be
come darker as it progresses to
the death scene where Carmen is
killed in a fading pool of light on
a darkened stage.
Musical Director is MarkPenn
and choreographer is Les Wil
liams.
Performances are at 8 p.m. on
April 15,16,17, 22, 23 and 24 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
