## Ducks in top form 
### 
Last Friday evening, Duck's
Breath Mystery Theatre made
their final appearance on cam
pus for this year. Never have I
seen them in better form than in
two of their longer pieces, A Cliff
Notes Hamlet and Gonad the
Barbarian.
The former is a combination
lecture-discussion led by Dr.
Cliff Note with a group of highly
unlikely colleagues ("Sopho
cles', Shakespeare's and Simon's
names all began with the letter
's' and wrote about the same
things." "What sorts of things
are those?" "Ohhh . . . life and
stuff." Pause. "Professor True-
Axe, do you have anything to
add, or better still a digres
sion?") All this is intermixed
with a fractured production of
Hamlet itself (". . . and flights of
angels will guide me thru the
sky, but what's this on my face?
. .. It's my nose.")

The other play comes from
Marvel's Gonad (ho Barbarian. It
was so good 1 wish I had re
corded it, it being almost Joy
cean in manipulation of lan
guage. An example: born in the
town of Trophin, he cries
"Gonad o' Trophin will save
you." Gonadotrophs is also a
popular hormone.
One of my favorite moments is
when, along with Ho-don, the
wandering minstral, Gonad con
fronts a rubber toy squeak bear.
Gonad: You speak squeak
bear?
Ho-don: Why yes, I was raised
by a pack of squeak bears in the
wilderness.
Both of these plays and most of
the others belong to a school of
comedy that says if you make a
situation weird enough, people
will find something to laugh at.
If last Friday is any indication,
they do, indeed.
