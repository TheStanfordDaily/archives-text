## De Waart falls short on 'Requiem' 
### 
Edo de Waart returned to the
podium of the San Francisco
Symphony last week to conduct
one of the season's most eagerly
anticipated productions, the
Messa di Requiem of Giuseppe
Verdi.
While it can not be denied that
there were moments of inspired
singing and playing in virtually
every section of the work, the
opening performance Wednes
day evening left, on the whole, a
great deal to be desired. It was a
respectable effort, but not much
more, confronting the audience
with very little that was truly
remarkable.
Verdi's Requiem is, after all, a
work that should confront the
listener with a vengeance. In it,
Verdi reaches as deeply into the
human spirit as in any of the
operas from his mature years,
projecting its agitation, its ful
ness and emotion, the essentials
of its humanity, as compassion
ately and as dramatically as has
ever been done.
In this sense, the Requiem is fit
to stand beside the two other
works which offer the most sub
lime summation of man's rela
tionship to the eternal — Dante's
Divine Comedy and
Michaelangelo's Last Judge
ment. It is enough to convince us
that, spiritually, we are all Ita
lians, no matter what else we are.
De Waart, from the very open
ing of the Requiem, made it clear
that he had departed from the
theatrical expansiveness of Ver
di's conception and had chosen
instead to approach the score
with a characteristically Dutch
sense of reserve, aiming to sac

rifice impact for greater inti
macy. All too often, what he
achieved was a performance that
skated along the surface, lacking
intensity and depth of feeling,
and imposing restraint where
boldness and imagination
would have been more approp
riate to Verdi's intentions.
Admittedly, De Waart's in
terpretive stance proved to be vi
able in certain parts of the work.
The opening Requiem and Kyrie
emerged from his direction with
an unexpected gentleness and
sincerity. Yet the dangers of an
overly restrained interpretation
made themselves apparent, here
and elsewhere, in the singing of
the Symphony Chorus, which
was characterized, particularly
in the early going, by a lack of
presence. In the opening Re
quiem their delivery was
breathy, and balanced in such a
way that there was not enough
bass to the sound. A chorus
which had been asked to reveal
in its singing a glimpse of the
towering drama behind the
music could have sung these
pages at half the dynamic level
and with twice the presence, as
the chorus of the Teatro alia
Scala did when performing the
Requiem this fall as part of their
first American tour.
Where De Waart's interpreta
tion failed conclusively was in
the Dies Irae. This immense
movement is the core of the
work; its aural imagery presents
the listener with an overwhelm
ing vision of the final judge
ment, a rehearsal for the end of
the world in which the spiritual
drama of wrath, torment, and

supplication is portrayed in ges
tures spectacularly larger than
life, as only the greatest master
in the history of opera could
conceive them.
The ensemble was well
coordinated throughout, but the
overall continuity of the move
ment was lost in De Waart's
hands, while the intensity of
feeling upon which everything
else depends never materialized.
Verdi must have taken a cer
tain ironic pleasure in writing
the Dies Irae, for he made certain
that his performers, like sinners,
would have no place to hide.
Thus, bass soloist Paul Plishka
had to earn his salvation with a
magnificent rendering of Mors
stupebit, sung from memory and
with an ideal theatricality.
Mezzo-soprano Gwendolyn Kil
lebrew was less fortunate, com
promising the majority of her
solos with diction that ranged
from mediocre to unintelligible.
The tenor soloist, Seth McCoy,
had too little voice and too wide
a vibrato to do justice to Verdi's
demanding writing. Ultimately,
it was soprano Katia Ricciarelli
who stood out among the solo
quartet, and, despite a tendency
to scoop some of her tones, won
instant sainthood with her sensi
tive and highly musical expres
sion.
The chorus succeeded in get
ting notes and dynamics in
place, but fell short as far as pro
jection was concerned, particu
larly in pianissimo. Toward the
end of the movement their sing
ing began to lose focus and the
final "amen," which should
have been breathtaking, suffered
from a lack of sonority.
The playing of the orchestra
was technically sound, but not
nearly wild enough. In the
climaxes the effect was loud,
without being powerful, while
in the softer passages instrumen
tal lines were simply not bold
enough. Thus, the pathetic
offbeat appoggicituras given to
the violins in the Lacrymosa did
not receive the accents which
Verdi calls for. The first violins
also experienced difficulty in
handling the sextuplet figure
which accompanies the choral
Dies Irae immediately following
the mezzo's Liber scriptus.
The high point of theDies Irae
in Wednesday's performance
was the Ingemisco. Here, in spite
of merely adequate singing from
McCoy, the absolutely sublime
elevation of Verdi's art man
ifested itself through the beauti
ful setting of text to music,
which, at the words in parte de
xtra, reaches the white heat of
feeling.
The Offeratorium proceeded
in much the same vein as the
Dies Irae. Its beginning, a won
derful solo for the cello section,
sounded disappointingly slug
gish; evidently, the members of
the section had difficulty sens
ing the line because De Waart
remained neutral in his beat and
in the shaping of phrases. Later,

there was not nearly enough ex
pression from the two solo first
violins accompanying the sop
rano's Sed signi/er sonctus, nor
was anything made of the
offbeats in violins and violas at
the tenor solo Quan oiim Ab
rahae. In general, the move
ment's expressive climaxes
lacked conviction until Kic
ciarelli carried everything away
with a touchingly beautiful de
livery of fac eas de morte trans
ire ad vitam. Her ineffably ten
der ascent to the high A-flat eli
cited an astonished intensity of
expression from the strings in
the closing passage of the
movement.
Perhaps because of this shot
in the arm, the Sanctus attained
a higher level of expressive fer
vor than had heretofore been felt.
But the effect of the movement
was lessened somewhat at the
end when the chorus rushed
through the final Hosanna in ex
cel sis.
Things continued at this level
in the Agnus Dei. The unison
duet of soprano and mezzo
soprano which begins the
movement was highly effective,
and the playing of the orchestra,
especially the strings, was con
sistently more sensitive than in
prior sections of the work.
The Lux Aeterna shows Verdi
at his atmospheric best, and fea
tures the solo trio of mezzo
soprano, tenor and bass. (Always
a practical man of the theater,
Verdi saves the soprano and the
chorus for the concluding Libera
me.) Plishka's solo pronounce
ment of Requiem aeternam at the
beginning of the movement was
notable for its sonority, but
rather short on sentiment.
In the Libera me De Waart did
considerably more than he had
in previous movements to shape
the chorus dynamics, which re
sulted in a pianissimo opening
that, at least, had real presence.
Ricciarelli, obviously at home in
the music, sang the taxing solo
with heartfelt intensity of ex
pression to which chorus and
orchestra alike responded with
distinction.
The audience was slow to
show its enthusiasm, but even
tually granted the performers a
standing ovation.

Edo de Waart returned to the
podium of the San Francisco
Symphony last week to conduct
one of the season's most eagerly
anticipated productions, the
Messa di Requiem of Giuseppe
Verdi.
While it can not be denied that
there were moments of inspired
singing and playing in virtually
every section of the work, the
opening performance Wednes
day evening left, on the whole, a
great deal to be desired. It was a
respectable effort, but not much
more, confronting the audience
with very little that was truly
remarkable.
Verdi's Requiem is, after all, a
work that should confront the
listener with a vengeance. In it,
Verdi reaches as deeply into the
human spirit as in any of the
operas from his mature years,
projecting its agitation, its ful
ness and emotion, the essentials
of its humanity, as compassion
ately and as dramatically as has
ever been done.
In this sense, the Requiem is fit
to stand beside the two other
works which offer the most sub
lime summation of man's rela
tionship to the eternal — Dante's
Divine Comedy and
Michaelangelo's Last Judge
ment. It is enough to convince us
that, spiritually, we are all Ita
lians, no matter what else we are.
De Waart, from the very open
ing of the Requiem, made it clear
that he had departed from the
theatrical expansiveness of Ver
di's conception and had chosen
instead to approach the score
with a characteristically Dutch
sense of reserve, aiming to sac

rifice impact for greater inti
macy. All too often, what he
achieved was a performance that
skated along the surface, lacking
intensity and depth of feeling,
and imposing restraint where
boldness and imagination
would have been more approp
riate to Verdi's intentions.
Admittedly, De Waart's in
terpretive stance proved to be vi
able in certain parts of the work.
The opening Requiem and Kyrie
emerged from his direction with
an unexpected gentleness and
sincerity. Yet the dangers of an
overly restrained interpretation
made themselves apparent, here
and elsewhere, in the singing of
the Symphony Chorus, which
was characterized, particularly
in the early going, by a lack of
presence. In the opening Re
quiem their delivery was
breathy, and balanced in such a
way that there was not enough
bass to the sound. A chorus
which had been asked to reveal
in its singing a glimpse of the
towering drama behind the
music could have sung these
pages at half the dynamic level
and with twice the presence, as
the chorus of the Teatro alia
Scala did when performing the
Requiem this fall as part of their
first American tour.
Where De Waart's interpreta
tion failed conclusively was in
the Dies Irae. This immense
movement is the core of the
work; its aural imagery presents
the listener with an overwhelm
ing vision of the final judge
ment, a rehearsal for the end of
the world in which the spiritual
drama of wrath, torment, and

supplication is portrayed in ges
tures spectacularly larger than
life, as only the greatest master
in the history of opera could
conceive them.
The ensemble was well
coordinated throughout, but the
overall continuity of the move
ment was lost in De Waart's
hands, while the intensity of
feeling upon which everything
else depends never materialized.
Verdi must have taken a cer
tain ironic pleasure in writing
the Dies Irae, for he made certain
that his performers, like sinners,
would have no place to hide.
Thus, bass soloist Paul Plishka
had to earn his salvation with a
magnificent rendering of Mors
stupebit, sung from memory and
with an ideal theatricality.
Mezzo-soprano Gwendolyn Kil
lebrew was less fortunate, com
promising the majority of her
solos with diction that ranged
from mediocre to unintelligible.
The tenor soloist, Seth McCoy,
had too little voice and too wide
a vibrato to do justice to Verdi's
demanding writing. Ultimately,
it was soprano Katia Ricciarelli
who stood out among the solo
quartet, and, despite a tendency
to scoop some of her tones, won
instant sainthood with her sensi
tive and highly musical expres
sion.
The chorus succeeded in get
ting notes and dynamics in
place, but fell short as far as pro
jection was concerned, particu
larly in pianissimo. Toward the
end of the movement their sing
ing began to lose focus and the
final "amen," which should
have been breathtaking, suffered
from a lack of sonority.
The playing of the orchestra
was technically sound, but not
nearly wild enough. In the
climaxes the effect was loud,
without being powerful, while
in the softer passages instrumen
tal lines were simply not bold
enough. Thus, the pathetic
offbeat appoggicituras given to
the violins in the Lacrymosa did
not receive the accents which
Verdi calls for. The first violins
also experienced difficulty in
handling the sextuplet figure
which accompanies the choral
Dies Irae immediately following
the mezzo's Liber scriptus.
The high point of theDies Irae
in Wednesday's performance
was the Ingemisco. Here, in spite
of merely adequate singing from
McCoy, the absolutely sublime
elevation of Verdi's art man
ifested itself through the beauti
ful setting of text to music,
which, at the words in parte de
xtra, reaches the white heat of
feeling.
The Offeratorium proceeded
in much the same vein as the
Dies Irae. Its beginning, a won
derful solo for the cello section,
sounded disappointingly slug
gish; evidently, the members of
the section had difficulty sens
ing the line because De Waart
remained neutral in his beat and
in the shaping of phrases. Later,

there was not nearly enough ex
pression from the two solo first
violins accompanying the sop
rano's Sed signi/er sonctus, nor
was anything made of the
offbeats in violins and violas at
the tenor solo Quan oiim Ab
rahae. In general, the move
ment's expressive climaxes
lacked conviction until Kic
ciarelli carried everything away
with a touchingly beautiful de
livery of fac eas de morte trans
ire ad vitam. Her ineffably ten
der ascent to the high A-flat eli
cited an astonished intensity of
expression from the strings in
the closing passage of the
movement.
Perhaps because of this shot
in the arm, the Sanctus attained
a higher level of expressive fer
vor than had heretofore been felt.
But the effect of the movement
was lessened somewhat at the
end when the chorus rushed
through the final Hosanna in ex
cel sis.
Things continued at this level
in the Agnus Dei. The unison
duet of soprano and mezzo
soprano which begins the
movement was highly effective,
and the playing of the orchestra,
especially the strings, was con
sistently more sensitive than in
prior sections of the work.
The Lux Aeterna shows Verdi
at his atmospheric best, and fea

in the shaping of phrases. Later,

there was not nearly enough ex
pression from the two solo first
violins accompanying the sop
rano's Sed signi/er sonctus, nor
was anything made of the
offbeats in violins and violas at
the tenor solo Quan oiim Ab
rahae. In general, the move
ment's expressive climaxes
lacked conviction until Kic
ciarelli carried everything away
with a touchingly beautiful de
livery of fac eas de morte trans

der ascent to the high A-flat eli
cited an astonished intensity of
expression from the strings in
the closing passage of the
movement.
Perhaps because of this shot
in the arm, the Sanctus attained
a higher level of expressive fer
vor than had heretofore been felt.
But the effect of the movement
was lessened somewhat at the
end when the chorus rushed
through the final Hosanna in ex
cel sis.
Things continued at this level
in the Agnus Dei. The unison
duet of soprano and mezzo
soprano which begins the
movement was highly effective,
and the playing of the orchestra,
especially the strings, was con
sistently more sensitive than in
prior sections of the work.
The Lux Aeterna shows Verdi
at his atmospheric best, and fea
tures the solo trio of mezzo
soprano, tenor and bass. (Always
a practical man of the theater,
Verdi saves the soprano and the
chorus for the concluding Libera
me.) Plishka's solo pronounce
ment of Requiem aeternam at the
beginning of the movement was
notable for its sonority, but
rather short on sentiment.
In the Libera me De Waart did
considerably more than he had
in previous movements to shape
the chorus dynamics, which re
sulted in a pianissimo opening
that, at least, had real presence.
Ricciarelli, obviously at home in
the music, sang the taxing solo
with heartfelt intensity of ex

orchestra alike responded with
distinction.
The audience was slow to
show its enthusiasm, but even

Edo de Waart returned to the
podium of the San Francisco
Symphony last week to conduct
one of the season's most eagerly
anticipated productions, the
Messa di Requiem of Giuseppe
Verdi.
While it can not be denied that
there were moments of inspired
singing and playing in virtually
every section of the work, the
opening performance Wednes
day evening left, on the whole, a
great deal to be desired. It was a
respectable effort, but not much
more, confronting the audience
with very little that was truly
remarkable.
Verdi's Requiem is, after all, a
work that should confront the
listener with a vengeance. In it,
Verdi reaches as deeply into the
human spirit as in any of the
operas from his mature years,
projecting its agitation, its ful
ness and emotion, the essentials
of its humanity, as compassion
ately and as dramatically as has
ever been done.
In this sense, the Requiem is fit
to stand beside the two other
works which offer the most sub
lime summation of man's rela
tionship to the eternal — Dante's
Divine Comedy and
Michaelangelo's Last Judge
ment. It is enough to convince us
that, spiritually, we are all Ita
lians, no matter what else we are.
De Waart, from the very open
ing of the Requiem, made it clear
that he had departed from the
theatrical expansiveness of Ver
di's conception and had chosen
instead to approach the score
with a characteristically Dutch
sense of reserve, aiming to sac

rifice impact for greater inti
macy. All too often, what he
achieved was a performance that
skated along the surface, lacking
intensity and depth of feeling,
and imposing restraint where
boldness and imagination
would have been more approp
riate to Verdi's intentions.
Admittedly, De Waart's in
terpretive stance proved to be vi
able in certain parts of the work.
The opening Requiem and Kyrie
emerged from his direction with
an unexpected gentleness and
sincerity. Yet the dangers of an
overly restrained interpretation
made themselves apparent, here
and elsewhere, in the singing of
the Symphony Chorus, which
was characterized, particularly
in the early going, by a lack of
presence. In the opening Re
quiem their delivery was
breathy, and balanced in such a
way that there was not enough
bass to the sound. A chorus
which had been asked to reveal
in its singing a glimpse of the
towering drama behind the
music could have sung these
pages at half the dynamic level
and with twice the presence, as
the chorus of the Teatro alia
Scala did when performing the
Requiem this fall as part of their
first American tour.
Where De Waart's interpreta
tion failed conclusively was in
the Dies Irae. This immense
movement is the core of the
work; its aural imagery presents
the listener with an overwhelm
ing vision of the final judge
ment, a rehearsal for the end of
the world in which the spiritual
drama of wrath, torment, and

supplication is portrayed in ges
tures spectacularly larger than
life, as only the greatest master
in the history of opera could
conceive them.
The ensemble was well
coordinated throughout, but the
overall continuity of the move
ment was lost in De Waart's
hands, while the intensity of
feeling upon which everything
else depends never materialized.
Verdi must have taken a cer
tain ironic pleasure in writing
the Dies Irae, for he made certain
that his performers, like sinners,
would have no place to hide.
Thus, bass soloist Paul Plishka
had to earn his salvation with a
magnificent rendering of Mors
stupebit, sung from memory and
with an ideal theatricality.
Mezzo-soprano Gwendolyn Kil
lebrew was less fortunate, com
promising the majority of her
solos with diction that ranged
from mediocre to unintelligible.
The tenor soloist, Seth McCoy,
had too little voice and too wide
a vibrato to do justice to Verdi's
demanding writing. Ultimately,
it was soprano Katia Ricciarelli
who stood out among the solo
quartet, and, despite a tendency
to scoop some of her tones, won
instant sainthood with her sensi
tive and highly musical expres
sion.
The chorus succeeded in get
ting notes and dynamics in
place, but fell short as far as pro
jection was concerned, particu
larly in pianissimo. Toward the
end of the movement their sing
ing began to lose focus and the
final "amen," which should
have been breathtaking, suffered
from a lack of sonority.
The playing of the orchestra
was technically sound, but not
nearly wild enough. In the
climaxes the effect was loud,
without being powerful, while
in the softer passages instrumen
tal lines were simply not bold
enough. Thus, the pathetic
offbeat appoggicituras given to
the violins in the Lacrymosa did
not receive the accents which
Verdi calls for. The first violins
also experienced difficulty in
handling the sextuplet figure
which accompanies the choral
Dies Irae immediately following
the mezzo's Liber scriptus.
The high point of theDies Irae
in Wednesday's performance
was the Ingemisco. Here, in spite
of merely adequate singing from
McCoy, the absolutely sublime
elevation of Verdi's art man
ifested itself through the beauti
ful setting of text to music,
which, at the words in parte de
xtra, reaches the white heat of
feeling.
The Offeratorium proceeded
in much the same vein as the
Dies Irae. Its beginning, a won
derful solo for the cello section,
sounded disappointingly slug
gish; evidently, the members of
the section had difficulty sens
ing the line because De Waart
remained neutral in his beat and
in the shaping of phrases. Later,

there was not nearly enough ex
pression from the two solo first
violins accompanying the sop
rano's Sed signi/er sonctus, nor
was anything made of the
offbeats in violins and violas at
the tenor solo Quan oiim Ab
rahae. In general, the move

have been breathtaking, suffered
from a lack of sonority.
The playing of the orchestra
was technically sound, but not
nearly wild enough. In the
climaxes the effect was loud,
without being powerful, while
in the softer passages instrumen
tal lines were simply not bold
enough. Thus, the pathetic
offbeat appoggicituras given to
the violins in the Lacrymosa did
not receive the accents which
Verdi calls for. The first violins
also experienced difficulty in
handling the sextuplet figure

Dies Irae immediately following

The high point of theDies Irae
in Wednesday's performance

which, at the words in parte de

feeling.
The Offeratorium proceeded
in much the same vein as the
Dies Irae. Its beginning, a won
derful solo for the cello section,
sounded disappointingly slug
gish; evidently, the members of
the section had difficulty sens

remained neutral in his beat and
in the shaping of phrases. Later,

there was not nearly enough ex

violins accompanying the sop
rano's Sed signi/er sonctus, nor
was anything made of the
offbeats in violins and violas at
the tenor solo Quan oiim Ab

expression from the strings in
the closing passage of the
movement.
Perhaps because of this shot
in the arm, the Sanctus attained
a higher level of expressive fer
vor than had heretofore been felt.
But the effect of the movement
was lessened somewhat at the
end when the chorus rushed
through the final Hosanna in ex

Things continued at this level
in the Agnus Dei. The unison
duet of soprano and mezzo
soprano which begins the
movement was highly effective,
and the playing of the orchestra,
especially the strings, was con
sistently more sensitive than in
prior sections of the work.
The Lux Aeterna shows Verdi
at his atmospheric best, and fea
tures the solo trio of mezzo
soprano, tenor and bass. (Always
a practical man of the theater,
Verdi saves the soprano and the
chorus for the concluding Libera
me.) Plishka's solo pronounce
ment of Requiem aeternam at the
beginning of the movement was
notable for its sonority, but
rather short on sentiment.
In the Libera me De Waart did
considerably more than he had
in previous movements to shape
the chorus dynamics, which re
sulted in a pianissimo opening
that, at least, had real presence.
Ricciarelli, obviously at home in
the music, sang the taxing solo
with heartfelt intensity of ex
pression to which chorus and
orchestra alike responded with
distinction.
The audience was slow to
show its enthusiasm, but even
tually granted the performers a
standing ovation.

Edo de Waart returned to the
podium of the San Francisco
Symphony last week to conduct
one of the season's most eagerly
anticipated productions, the
Messa di Requiem of Giuseppe
Verdi.
While it can not be denied that
there were moments of inspired
singing and playing in virtually
every section of the work, the
opening performance Wednes
day evening left, on the whole, a
great deal to be desired. It was a
respectable effort, but not much
more, confronting the audience
with very little that was truly
remarkable.
Verdi's Requiem is, after all, a
work that should confront the
listener with a vengeance. In it,
Verdi reaches as deeply into the
human spirit as in any of the
operas from his mature years,
projecting its agitation, its ful
ness and emotion, the essentials
of its humanity, as compassion
ately and as dramatically as has
ever been done.
In this sense, the Requiem is fit
to stand beside the two other
works which offer the most sub
lime summation of man's rela
tionship to the eternal — Dante's
Divine Comedy and
Michaelangelo's Last Judge
ment. It is enough to convince us
that, spiritually, we are all Ita
lians, no matter what else we are.
De Waart, from the very open
ing of the Requiem, made it clear
that he had departed from the
theatrical expansiveness of Ver
di's conception and had chosen
instead to approach the score
with a characteristically Dutch
sense of reserve, aiming to sac

rifice impact for greater inti
macy. All too often, what he
achieved was a performance that
skated along the surface, lacking
intensity and depth of feeling,
and imposing restraint where
boldness and imagination
would have been more approp
riate to Verdi's intentions.
Admittedly, De Waart's in
terpretive stance proved to be vi
able in certain parts of the work.
The opening Requiem and Kyrie
emerged from his direction with
an unexpected gentleness and
sincerity. Yet the dangers of an
overly restrained interpretation
made themselves apparent, here
and elsewhere, in the singing of
the Symphony Chorus, which
was characterized, particularly
in the early going, by a lack of
presence. In the opening Re
quiem their delivery was
breathy, and balanced in such a
way that there was not enough
bass to the sound. A chorus
which had been asked to reveal
in its singing a glimpse of the
towering drama behind the
music could have sung these
pages at half the dynamic level
and with twice the presence, as
the chorus of the Teatro alia
Scala did when performing the
Requiem this fall as part of their
first American tour.
Where De Waart's interpreta
tion failed conclusively was in
the Dies Irae. This immense
movement is the core of the
work; its aural imagery presents
the listener with an overwhelm
ing vision of the final judge
ment, a rehearsal for the end of
the world in which the spiritual
drama of wrath, torment, and

supplication is portrayed in ges
tures spectacularly larger than
life, as only the greatest master
in the history of opera could
conceive them.
The ensemble was well
coordinated throughout, but the
overall continuity of the move
ment was lost in De Waart's
hands, while the intensity of
feeling upon which everything
else depends never materialized.
Verdi must have taken a cer
tain ironic pleasure in writing
the Dies Irae, for he made certain
that his performers, like sinners,
would have no place to hide.
Thus, bass soloist Paul Plishka
had to earn his salvation with a
magnificent rendering of Mors
stupebit, sung from memory and
with an ideal theatricality.
Mezzo-soprano Gwendolyn Kil
lebrew was less fortunate, com
promising the majority of her
solos with diction that ranged
from mediocre to unintelligible.
The tenor soloist, Seth McCoy,
had too little voice and too wide
a vibrato to do justice to Verdi's
demanding writing. Ultimately,
it was soprano Katia Ricciarelli
who stood out among the solo
quartet, and, despite a tendency
to scoop some of her tones, won
instant sainthood with her sensi
tive and highly musical expres
sion.
The chorus succeeded in get
ting notes and dynamics in
place, but fell short as far as pro
jection was concerned, particu
larly in pianissimo. Toward the
end of the movement their sing
ing began to lose focus and the
final "amen," which should
have been breathtaking, suffered
from a lack of sonority.
The playing of the orchestra
was technically sound, but not
nearly wild enough. In the
climaxes the effect was loud,
without being powerful, while
in the softer passages instrumen
tal lines were simply not bold
enough. Thus, the pathetic
offbeat appoggicituras given to
the violins in the Lacrymosa did
not receive the accents which
Verdi calls for. The first violins
also experienced difficulty in
handling the sextuplet figure
which accompanies the choral
Dies Irae immediately following
the mezzo's Liber scriptus.
The high point of theDies Irae
in Wednesday's performance
was the Ingemisco. Here, in spite
of merely adequate singing from
McCoy, the absolutely sublime
elevation of Verdi's art man
ifested itself through the beauti
ful setting of text to music,
which, at the words in parte de
xtra, reaches the white heat of
feeling.
The Offeratorium proceeded
in much the same vein as the
Dies Irae. Its beginning, a won
derful solo for the cello section,
sounded disappointingly slug
gish; evidently, the members of
the section had difficulty sens
ing the line because De Waart
remained neutral in his beat and
in the shaping of phrases. Later,

there was not nearly enough ex
pression from the two solo first
violins accompanying the sop
rano's Sed signi/er sonctus, nor
was anything made of the
offbeats in violins and violas at
the tenor solo Quan oiim Ab
rahae. In general, the move
ment's expressive climaxes
lacked conviction until Kic
ciarelli carried everything away
with a touchingly beautiful de
livery of fac eas de morte trans
ire ad vitam. Her ineffably ten
der ascent to the high A-flat eli
cited an astonished intensity of
expression from the strings in
the closing passage of the

Perhaps because of this shot
in the arm, the Sanctus attained
