## 'Jaws,' 'pseudoart' and the capitalist system 
### 
The success of Jaws, first as a
best-seller and then as the
biggest box-office attraction of
all time, serves to illustrate the
ways in which such pseudoartis
tic products that under
capitalism are conceived of sol
ely in terms of their market value
can gain such popularity among
the general public.
When the finished novel was
going to press, the film produc
ers were already buying the
copyright to make a film of it.
Secondary plots and personages
were eliminated from the final
script so as to have the dramatic
conflict concentrate on the as
pects which commercial cinema
could best exploit to create the
spectacular: the presence and
hunting down of the. man
hunting shark. A spate of arti
cles, interviews and books ap
peared, going into detail about
the sensational design of the
mechanical fish built specially
for the film and about how the
actual filming was progressing.
In short, when the film finally
had its first showing it had a
public which had been con
ditioned during three years for
the final experience of seeing it
on screen.
Jaws is no isolated production;
it represents one of the most re
cent trends in U.S. cinema today.
Over the last few years, a spate of
films coming out of the Hol
lywood studios have specialized
in horrific themes or large-scale

natural or artificial catastrophes
such as earthquakes, fires, acci
dents and so forth.
The present proliferation of
this kind of film in the United
States is not a chance occurr
ence. Aside from how well they
are received by the general pub
lic in terms of entertainment
value and aside from their being
a commercial success, it can be
said historically speaking that
the proliferation of thriller films
has always coincided with the
most violent times of crisis in the
United States.
We should bear in mind that it
was in the early '30s when the
country was going through the
economic crisis following the
1929 crash, that the most famous
monster of the screen was
created: King Kong. That was the
time when horror films in gen
eral became really popular, with
the first film versions of such
world-famous figures as Dracula
and Frankenstein. So it is that
today, as the country is going
through a sharp economic reces
sion similar to that of the '30s, it
is curious to see the upsurge of a
similar cinematographic
phenomenon.
What are the reasons for this?
In the first place, the content
matter of the films that fall
within this trend is extraordi
nary in the extent to which it
mirrors the general state of in
security, danger and chaos typi
cal of a system in crisis.

It should come as no surprise
that at the time of the premiere
cartoonists in the U.S. press
began to depict the shark as in
flation, unemployment and
other national calamities. Sec
ondly, these films provide such
violent sensations for the spec
tator that large doses of the same
become a means of escape, of
shaking off the oppressive bur
den of reality.
Moreover, nearly all these
films have a dramatic structure
in common; they always lead up
to an ending in which the social
order that has been temporarily
threatened by the events in ques
tion is restored, laws can be
taken as a prototype: the given
state of affairs is shattered as a
strange and terrifying element
erupts onto the scene, disrupting
everyday life, until the forces of
order are established anew and
normality is restored.
It is significant that the chief of
police is attributed the main role
of getting rid of the threat hang
ing over society. It is his instinct
for survival that in the end turns

out to be the most effective
weapon against the shark â€”
much more than the knowledge
and experience of his fellow
hunters.
He is projected as a walking
example of social responsibility
in the community and is in
vested with a great many
humane and moral virtues
which are quite clearly biased
toward presenting an idealized
image of the loyal guardian of
the establishment.
His great sense of duty pre
vails, even to the extent of his
standing up to the pressure
exerted by irresponsible local
traders who, disregarding the
danger warnings for summer
vacationists and backed by the
mayor, were bent on keeping
tourist spots open so as not to
lose money during the summer
season. Such a character role is
designed to give him the dimen
sions of a hero and to provoke
trust in and administration for
the body of authority that he rep

resents.
As a combination of adventure
and suspense, the film is equally
effective, technically speaking,
in both genres, and that is pre
cisely what gives it its great en
tertainment value. It is very
cleverly put together so as to
create dramatic situations that
give rise to feelings of tension,
anxiety and relaxation in turn on
the part of the spectator.
All the resources used in the
film, right from the exact repro
duction of a giant white shark,
allows the film to make improb
able happenings seem plausible.
Reality is a far cry from what we
are presented with on screen.
But, of course, it is the spectacu
lar and not reality which has
brought in what will soon be
$120 million in profits to
make Jaws the biggest concern in
box-office history.
