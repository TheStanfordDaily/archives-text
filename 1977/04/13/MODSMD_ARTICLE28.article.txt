Carter commutes Liddy sentence
Washington — President Jimmy Carter commuted
the 20-year prison sentence of Watergate burglary
mastermind G. Gordon Liddy to eight years yester
day "in the interests of equity and fairness."
Thus, the 46-year-old Liddy will be eligible for
parole on July 9 after having served a total of 50
months.
"I'm grateful to the president for commuting my
sentence and bringing it into line with the sentences
received by Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlichman and
Hunt," Liddy told his lawyer, Peter Maroulis.
Once Liddy is released, all the participants in the
June 17, 1972, burglary at Democratic party head
quarters in the Watergate office building will be free.
Without presidential intervention, Liddy would

not have been eligible for parole until May 1, 1981.
Deputy White House Press Secretary Rex Granum
said the president commuted Liddy's sentence "in
the interests of equity and fairness based on a com
parison of Mr. Liddy's sentence with those of all
others convicted in Watergate-related proceedings."
Liddy was given the harshest sentence, six years,
eight months to 20 years, by U.S. District Judge John
J. Sirica. Liddy also was fined $40,000.
Soviets, U.S. confer on nuclear arms
Washington — President Jimmy Carter conferred
yesterday with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobry
nin in an effort to resume discussions on a treaty
limiting nuclear weapons.
The 40-minute session at the White House was
held against a backdrop of a dispute over apparent
Russian violations of new American fishing regula
tions. But U.S. officials said this was only "touched
on" and that the concentration was on arms.
Dobrynin's call was arranged before the Coast
Guard seized Soviet fishing vessels off the Mas
sachusetts coast over the weekend where they were
in apparent violation of the 200-mile U.S. zone estab
lished last month.
Carter and Dobrynin discussed possibly sending
Paul Warnke, the U.S. arms control chief, to Geneva
this month to renew weapons discussions before
Vance meets with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko in May.
These talks are likely to be critical in the effort to
reach an agreement to limit nuclear weapons and
take some steps toward general disarmament.
Carter has said if they are unproductive and the
Soviets do not negotiate "in good faith" he would be
forced to consider stepping up U.S. weapon de
velopment.

U.S. increases aid to Zaire
Kinshasa, Zaire — Moroccan troops sent to help
repel an invasion from Angola were digging yester
day around the mining center of kolwezi, as the
United States announced it was increasing aid to
Zaire's embattled pro-Western government.
About 1500 Moroccans, who arrived in southern
Shaba province over the weekend, were taking ad
vantage of a week-long lull in the fighting to con
solidate supply lines, according to government offi
cial sources.
In Washington, the Carter administration said it
was stepping up aid to the government of President
Mobutu Sese Seko, giving it a total of about $13
million in "nonlethal assistance," including a cargo
plane.
However, spokesman Rex Granum said: "We do
not see the situation as an East-West confrontation."
The State Department said it turned down a re
quest for emergency military help, but was sending a
Cl3O cargo plane worth $9 million and other aid
including radio equipment and spare parts for
airplanes and vehicles.
An estimated 5000 invaders, believed to be led by
veterans of the Katangese secessionist army of the
late Moise Tshombe, attacked Shaba on March 8
from Marxist Angola, where they fled after their
rebel movement collapsed in the early 19605.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with daytime tempera
tures a little cooler. Patchy low clouds tonight and
tomorrow morning. Nighttime lows in the 40s and
daytime highs in the low 60s along the coast to mid
70s inland. Northwesterly winds 10 to 20 mph after
noons and evenings.

However, spokesman Rex Granum said: "We do
not see the situation as an East-West confrontation."
The State Department said it turned down a re
quest for emergency military help, but was sending a
Cl3O cargo plane worth $9 million and other aid
including radio equipment and spare parts for
airplanes and vehicles.
An estimated 5000 invaders, believed to be led by
veterans of the Katangese secessionist army of the
late Moise Tshombe, attacked Shaba on March 8
from Marxist Angola, where they fled after their
rebel movement collapsed in the early 19605.

Carter commutes Liddy sentence
Washington — President Jimmy Carter commuted
the 20-year prison sentence of Watergate burglary
mastermind G. Gordon Liddy to eight years yester
day "in the interests of equity and fairness."
Thus, the 46-year-old Liddy will be eligible for
parole on July 9 after having served a total of 50
months.
"I'm grateful to the president for commuting my
sentence and bringing it into line with the sentences
received by Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlichman and
Hunt," Liddy told his lawyer, Peter Maroulis.
Once Liddy is released, all the participants in the
June 17, 1972, burglary at Democratic party head
quarters in the Watergate office building will be free.
Without presidential intervention, Liddy would

not have been eligible for parole until May 1, 1981.
Deputy White House Press Secretary Rex Granum
said the president commuted Liddy's sentence "in
the interests of equity and fairness based on a com
parison of Mr. Liddy's sentence with those of all
others convicted in Watergate-related proceedings."
Liddy was given the harshest sentence, six years,
eight months to 20 years, by U.S. District Judge John
J. Sirica. Liddy also was fined $40,000.
Soviets, U.S. confer on nuclear arms
Washington — President Jimmy Carter conferred
yesterday with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobry
nin in an effort to resume discussions on a treaty
limiting nuclear weapons.
The 40-minute session at the White House was
held against a backdrop of a dispute over apparent
Russian violations of new American fishing regula
tions. But U.S. officials said this was only "touched
on" and that the concentration was on arms.
Dobrynin's call was arranged before the Coast
Guard seized Soviet fishing vessels off the Mas
sachusetts coast over the weekend where they were
in apparent violation of the 200-mile U.S. zone estab
lished last month.
Carter and Dobrynin discussed possibly sending
Paul Warnke, the U.S. arms control chief, to Geneva
this month to renew weapons discussions before
Vance meets with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko in May.
These talks are likely to be critical in the effort to
reach an agreement to limit nuclear weapons and
take some steps toward general disarmament.
Carter has said if they are unproductive and the
Soviets do not negotiate "in good faith" he would be
forced to consider stepping up U.S. weapon de
velopment.

U.S. increases aid to Zaire
Kinshasa, Zaire — Moroccan troops sent to help
repel an invasion from Angola were digging yester
day around the mining center of kolwezi, as the
United States announced it was increasing aid to
Zaire's embattled pro-Western government.
About 1500 Moroccans, who arrived in southern
Shaba province over the weekend, were taking ad
vantage of a week-long lull in the fighting to con
solidate supply lines, according to government offi
cial sources.
In Washington, the Carter administration said it
was stepping up aid to the government of President
Mobutu Sese Seko, giving it a total of about $13
million in "nonlethal assistance," including a cargo
plane.
However, spokesman Rex Granum said: "We do
not see the situation as an East-West confrontation."
The State Department said it turned down a re
