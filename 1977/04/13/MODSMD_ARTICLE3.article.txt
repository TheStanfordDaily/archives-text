# ASSU to give refunds at office
## 
### Chris Wasney 
This quarter's fee assessment re
funds are being distributed from the
ASSU office, contrary to an ASSU Se
nate resolution requiring refunds to be
passed out in White Plaza, according
to ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Mathe.
The senate resolution, passed Jan. 28
in an effort to make the refunds more
accessible, requires representatives of
each organization receiving assess
ments to distribute refunds in White
Plaza during the third and fourth
weeks of the quarter, according to Se
nate Chairman Dave Sharp.
However, Mathe, supported by
Sharp, decided to by-pass this resolu
tion, pending possible senate action
on Monday, because of the logistical
problems it posed.
"Until I see some concrete proce
dures for providing organization,
smooth cash flow and above all, sec
urity. I don't think I can do it (initiate
the plan)," Mathe said.
Bogus excuse
Sen. Jon Barth, a cosponsor of the
resolution, charged that "the security
issue is just a bogus excuse to dfscour
age students from getting their re
funds."

Mathe replied that Barth "has a mis
conception of what we're trying to do. I
don't see where a difference of 100 feet
is going to have that much of an effect.
"We publicize the refunds
adequately on the PTRs, so it's not like
we're trying to hide."
If the senate takes some action on
Monday to enforce its resolution
(which is quite possible, according to
Sharp), Mathe said he plans to remain
firm.
Sharp added, "This action involves
a violation of the by-laws, but I think
an agreement can be reached."
Sharp said he believes the senate
will either repeal the resolution or
allow the refunds to be distributed
from the office this quarter, but take
action to initiate the White Plaza plan
next quarter.
"There is a possibility that they will
postpone the refunds until the fifth or
sixth week of the quarter, and come up
with a viable procedure for distribu
tion," he said, "but that is unlikely."
Sharp, Mathe and Assoc. Student
Financial Manager Miles White all
criticized the plan for its logistical de
ficiencies.
"It's bad security to sit out in White
Plaza with $6000 on your desk, pas

sing out money," said White.
Mathe said the requirement that the
organizations themselves distribute
the refunds would also pose several
problems.
"A student will have to go get a dol
lar from each organization, whereas
with the ASSU running it, the student
just signed once, took his money, and
left," said Mathe. "This could entail
some really troublesome organiza
tional problems, and it would increase
the probability of someone cheating
the organizations."
