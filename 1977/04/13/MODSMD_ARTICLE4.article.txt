# Ellsberg: protests not in vain

### Debbie Gong-Guy 
Antiwar protesters' efforts in the late
1960s were not in vain, former defense
analyst and antiwar activist Daniel
Ellsberg said here last night.
Addressing a near-capacity crowd
in Kresge Auditorium, Ellsberg as
serted that protests against the Viet
nam War were instrumental in putting
off a plan by former President Richard
Nixon to destroy North Vietnamese
population centers in hopes of forcing
peace terms favorable to the United

States.
People in the antiwar movement
generally participated thinking their
efforts were not very likely to end the
war, Ellsberg said.
However, if there hadn't been pro
test marches beginning in 1964, the
war would probably still be going on,
asserted the former employe of the
RAND Corporation, the so-called
"think tank" of the Vietnam conflict.
The key to ending the war was stop
ping the bombing, said Ellsberg. He

said two things caused the bombing to
end: the unprecedented cutoff of funds
to Vietnam and the ousting of Nixon.
Apparently Nixon had many things
to hide, Ellsberg said, citing a book by
Roger Morris which revealed the plans
of the "October group," composed of
then-Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer and four others.
Ellsberg said the October group was
preparing plans to burn down North
Vietnam while protesters were prepar
ing for the Oct. 15, 1968 moratorium.
According to Morris, Ellsberg said,
the plan was called the "November op
tion" and involved unlimited full
scale bombing of North Vietnam, in
cluding B-52 bombing and U.S.
ground invasion of Cambodia and
Laos.
The plan, scheduled to be carried
out Nov. 3, 1969, included two op
tions, said Ellsberg: invading North
Vietnam with U.S. troops and using
tactical nuclear weapons to wipe out
staging areas, one of which was 1.5
miles from the China border.
"The protesters' moratoriums wor
ried Nixon and led him to employ
people to obstruct the antiwar move
ments' efforts. By causing this diver
sion, the protesters unknowingly were
delaying the implementation of the
November option," Ellsberg asserted.
He added that the protesters helped
"make the officials aware of the pub
lic's unwillingness to support indefi
nitely inflicting human suffering.
Consequently, the officials felt com
pelled to limit policies and take risks.
"The Vietnam war did get ended,
though, and it presents us with the
challenge to exploit our freedom and
harness the lies and fatal devastating
power of the leaders of the world."

war would probably still be going on,
asserted the former employe of the
RAND Corporation, the so-called
"think tank" of the Vietnam conflict.
The key to ending the war was stop
ping the bombing, said Ellsberg. He

said two things caused the bombing to
end: the unprecedented cutoff of funds
to Vietnam and the ousting of Nixon.
Apparently Nixon had many things
to hide, Ellsberg said, citing a book by
Roger Morris which revealed the plans
of the "October group," composed of
then-Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer and four others.
Ellsberg said the October group was
preparing plans to burn down North
Vietnam while protesters were prepar
ing for the Oct. 15, 1968 moratorium.
According to Morris, Ellsberg said,
the plan was called the "November op
tion" and involved unlimited full
scale bombing of North Vietnam, in
cluding B-52 bombing and U.S.
ground invasion of Cambodia and
Laos.
The plan, scheduled to be carried
out Nov. 3, 1969, included two op
tions, said Ellsberg: invading North
Vietnam with U.S. troops and using
tactical nuclear weapons to wipe out
staging areas, one of which was 1.5
miles from the China border.
"The protesters' moratoriums wor
ried Nixon and led him to employ
people to obstruct the antiwar move
ments' efforts. By causing this diver
sion, the protesters unknowingly were
delaying the implementation of the
November option," Ellsberg asserted.
He added that the protesters helped
"make the officials aware of the pub
lic's unwillingness to support indefi
nitely inflicting human suffering.
Consequently, the officials felt com
pelled to limit policies and take risks.
"The Vietnam war did get ended,
though, and it presents us with the
challenge to exploit our freedom and
harness the lies and fatal devastating
power of the leaders of the world."
