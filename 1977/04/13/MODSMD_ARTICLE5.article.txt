# Yell leaders may return
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
The strains of "All Right Now" fade and six energetic
looking students clad in rugby shirts and shorts begin
yelling from the track at the thousands in the student
section of Stanford Stadium:
Fe-fi-fo-fum
We got soul
Now you get some.
An unlikely scenario?
Possibly not.
Agreeing that yell leaders deserve another chance
here, a student-alumni ad hoc committee yesterday de
cided to hold campus-wide try outs and selection at the
end of this month or the beginning of May.
During the meeting at the Athletic Department, rep
resentatives from the Hand, the ASSIJ, COP, KZSU, the
Daily, the Inter-Fraternity Council, the Alumni Associa
tion and the football and basketball teams stressed the
importance of finding unconventional yell leaders.
The committee agreed that mechanical, block-sweater
yell leaders will not reach first base at Stanford. The
committee felt it important that yell leaders maintain the
distinctiveness of Stanford's spirit institutions, typified
currently by the Band and the Dollies.
Committee members will spend the next week solicit
ing student input on what type of yell leaders would be

most desirable and on how to proceed with selection.
Students and community members with suggestions
or ideas concerning yell leaders at Stanford can contact
GaryCavalli, Stanford sports information director, at the
Athletic Department. The committee will meet again
Monday to discuss and act on feedback.
"I think we are looking for imaginative, creative
people who reflect the Stanford student body," said
Cavalli.
Although some members brought a deal of skepticism
to the committee meeting, an optimistic attitude per
vaded during the discussions.
The committee agreed that try outs will be open to
both male and female students. A concensus also
emerged that support by the Band for the idea will be
essential for its success.
One member of the committee said that it is also essen
tial that yell leaders not become performers apart from
the fans, hut engage in active interplay with them.
