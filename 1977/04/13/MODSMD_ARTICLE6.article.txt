## Bem's tenure, Albers Wall 
### 
Support professor

Strange outlook

Recently the Department of
Psychology unanimously recom
mended that Sandra Bern be promoted
to the rank of associate professor with
tenure. As was announced (Daily,
April 7), Halsey Royden, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, has reversed that unanimous
decision and turned down her promo
tion.
Bern has now filed an appeal with
Provost William Miller. In that appeal,
she has argued that both her teaching
and her research satisfy the Universi
ty's criteria for tenure. However, she
herself can document the quality of her
teaching only with regard to lecture
performance and graduate training.
But clearly a faculty member's role as a
teacher extends beyond the narrow
boundaries of the classroom.
In her case in particular, we think
that weight must be given to the extent
to which she has had an impact on the
intellectual and personal lives of
members of the campus community.
Because documentation for this im
pact can only come from people other
than herself, we hereby solicit the
support of the campus community at
large on her behalf.
We urge any and all interested cam
pus groups to communicate in writing
to Miller about either her role
as a teacher in the broadest sense or
about any other issues directly related
to the tenure process. Please act
quickly.

Reading Jordan Lorence's column,
"Albers Wall as artwork, eyesore and
heartbreaker," (Daily, April 4) caused
me to reflect once again on the curious
effect of "artwork" on the Stanford
community. The absence of art never
appears to cause distress or heartbreak.
But the prospect that a work of art
might be brought to the campus
arouses apprehension.
People who have never shown an
interest in art or done anything for art
are quite willing to devote time and
effort to prevent it from coming here.
Law students, Lorence tells us, vow
that the new law school shall not be
come an art museum where, as he puts
it, one might "incidently" study torts.
He hastens to add that "they might
have been mollified if the artwork in
question was the Mona Lisa or
Michelangelo's David," but they did
not want their law school encumbered
with a "plain, ordinary white brick
wall."
Though I am rather charmed by the
idea of law students studying their
torts at the feet of Michelangelo's
David, I am bothered by what seems to
me a lapse of logic: if the law students'
objection is to the conversion of their
school into a museum, why allow such
works as the Mona Lisa and the David,
obvious museum pieces, while object
ing to the Albers Wall, which is appa
rently not artistic enough for the law
students and Lorence, though it evi
dently stirs his imagination and
suggests to him "ample fare for dimes
tore love thrillers."
But everything, even a plain white
brick wall, has a darker, newsworthier
side. Even though the Albers Wall may
not be a work of art, it might, given the
disposition of the local art audience,
become an object of vandalism. As a
senior majoring in communication,
Lorence is alert to this possibility, and
knows that "artworks," however bor
ing or bothersome in themselves, are
grist to the mills of journalism when
they are stolen or damaged.
It is clear that Lorence and the law
students know art when they see it. I
am much less sure than they, but I have
learned to recognize the jolly Philis
tine when I come across him, which
happens quite often.

works as the Mona Lisa and the David,
obvious museum pieces, while object
ing to the Albers Wall, which is appa
rently not artistic enough for the law
students and Lorence, though it evi
dently stirs his imagination and
suggests to him "ample fare for dimes
tore love thrillers."
But everything, even a plain white
brick wall, has a darker, newsworthier
side. Even though the Albers Wall may
not be a work of art, it might, given the
disposition of the local art audience,
become an object of vandalism. As a
senior majoring in communication,
Lorence is alert to this possibility, and
knows that "artworks," however bor
ing or bothersome in themselves, are
grist to the mills of journalism when
they are stolen or damaged.
It is clear that Lorence and the law
students know art when they see it. I
am much less sure than they, but I have
learned to recognize the jolly Philis
tine when I come across him, which
happens quite often.

Strange outlook

Recently the Department of
Psychology unanimously recom
mended that Sandra Bern be promoted
to the rank of associate professor with
tenure. As was announced (Daily,
April 7), Halsey Royden, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, has reversed that unanimous
decision and turned down her promo
tion.
Bern has now filed an appeal with
Provost William Miller. In that appeal,
she has argued that both her teaching
and her research satisfy the Universi
ty's criteria for tenure. However, she
herself can document the quality of her
teaching only with regard to lecture
performance and graduate training.
But clearly a faculty member's role as a
teacher extends beyond the narrow
boundaries of the classroom.
In her case in particular, we think
that weight must be given to the extent
to which she has had an impact on the
intellectual and personal lives of
members of the campus community.
Because documentation for this im
pact can only come from people other
than herself, we hereby solicit the
support of the campus community at
large on her behalf.
We urge any and all interested cam
pus groups to communicate in writing
to Miller about either her role
as a teacher in the broadest sense or
about any other issues directly related
to the tenure process. Please act
quickly.

Reading Jordan Lorence's column,
"Albers Wall as artwork, eyesore and
heartbreaker," (Daily, April 4) caused
me to reflect once again on the curious
effect of "artwork" on the Stanford
community. The absence of art never
appears to cause distress or heartbreak.
But the prospect that a work of art
might be brought to the campus
arouses apprehension.
People who have never shown an
interest in art or done anything for art
are quite willing to devote time and
effort to prevent it from coming here.
Law students, Lorence tells us, vow
that the new law school shall not be
come an art museum where, as he puts
it, one might "incidently" study torts.
He hastens to add that "they might
have been mollified if the artwork in
question was the Mona Lisa or
Michelangelo's David," but they did
not want their law school encumbered
with a "plain, ordinary white brick
wall."
Though I am rather charmed by the
idea of law students studying their
torts at the feet of Michelangelo's
David, I am bothered by what seems to
me a lapse of logic: if the law students'
objection is to the conversion of their
school into a museum, why allow such
works as the Mona Lisa and the David,
obvious museum pieces, while object
ing to the Albers Wall, which is appa
rently not artistic enough for the law
students and Lorence, though it evi
dently stirs his imagination and
suggests to him "ample fare for dimes
tore love thrillers."
