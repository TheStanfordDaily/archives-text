I believe that we all must have
causes and I myself am no exception.
And wouldn't it be enormously
gratifying to have everyone else sup
port our personal causes? Certainly it
would; but it is just not possible.
What kind of world would it be if
everyone tried to "Save the Whales?"
Sea World might love the idea of hav
ing 300 understudies for Shamu, but
there are people whose livelihoods
depend upon killing a certain number
of these animals. Thus, causes are a
highly subjective matter.
The Stanford campus is an espe
cially good place for anyone who
wants to solicit for a cause. The stu
dents here are open-minded, issue
oriented, and many of them have the
big bucks needed to get a cause off the
ground.
The solicitors know this and every
day they show up on campus looking
for potential solicitees to recruit for

their particular political or religious
organization.
Army of peddlers
These solicitors can always be seen
somewhere between the post office
and Tresidder carrying their armful of
newspapers and flagging down an oc
casional passerby.
Although they are courteous in their
approach, I cannot help but notice that
there are more and more of them every
day. To be sure, these are probably
very worthwhile causes, but enough is
enough.
Granted, solicitors are protected by
the First Amendment, but their right to
free speech does not include the right
to hornswaggle you out of a dollar —
the usual subscription rate for a news
letter.
I even have to doubt the legitimacy
of some of these causes. For example,
last week I was hit up for $5 by some
one who said he represented the Ex
treme Left Socialist Lobby. Of the $5 he
said $4.25 would go toward the cost of
establishing an office in Waco, Tex.
From now on I will be suspicious of
any man who claims to be a radical and
is wearing a leisure suit.
I admit that a few bad encounters
should not taint my opinion of these
people and their causes. I could be at
fault. Maybe something about me at
tracts shams. I bet that I could give
some fellow $1 to help him with the

lettuce boycott and find him in Tre
sidder later that day using the money
to order a chef's salad.

There are a few solutions to the sol
icitor problem, but the following one
seems most feasible. It may require
some expenditure on behalf of the
University, but the end result will
make it worthwhile. First, checkpoints
manned by psychologists will be
stationed at every point where people
have access to the campus grounds.
All solicitors entering the campus will
be required to answer the following
question:
"Would you want your daughter to
marry a ?" In the blank, the
psychologist would substitute the
words Gallo brother, whale, head of
lettuce, furry white baby seal, etc.
The psychologist would carefully
analyze the responses to each question
and then would refuse admittance to
every person, except those who know
Jerry Brown's mantra or S.I. Hayaka
wa's hat size.

highly subjective matter.
The Stanford campus is an espe
cially good place for anyone who
wants to solicit for a cause. The stu
dents here are open-minded, issue
oriented, and many of them have the
big bucks needed to get a cause off the
ground.
The solicitors know this and every
day they show up on campus looking
for potential solicitees to recruit for

their particular political or religious
organization.

These solicitors can always be seen
somewhere between the post office
and Tresidder carrying their armful of
newspapers and flagging down an oc
casional passerby.
Although they are courteous in their
approach, I cannot help but notice that
there are more and more of them every
day. To be sure, these are probably
very worthwhile causes, but enough is
enough.
Granted, solicitors are protected by
the First Amendment, but their right to
free speech does not include the right
to hornswaggle you out of a dollar —
the usual subscription rate for a news
letter.
I even have to doubt the legitimacy
of some of these causes. For example,
last week I was hit up for $5 by some
one who said he represented the Ex
treme Left Socialist Lobby. Of the $5 he
said $4.25 would go toward the cost of
establishing an office in Waco, Tex.
From now on I will be suspicious of
any man who claims to be a radical and
is wearing a leisure suit.
I admit that a few bad encounters
should not taint my opinion of these
people and their causes. I could be at
fault. Maybe something about me at
tracts shams. I bet that I could give
some fellow $1 to help him with the

lettuce boycott and find him in Tre
sidder later that day using the money
to order a chef's salad.

There are a few solutions to the sol
icitor problem, but the following one
seems most feasible. It may require
some expenditure on behalf of the
University, but the end result will
make it worthwhile. First, checkpoints
manned by psychologists will be
stationed at every point where people
have access to the campus grounds.
All solicitors entering the campus will
be required to answer the following
question:
"Would you want your daughter to
marry a ?" In the blank, the
psychologist would substitute the
words Gallo brother, whale, head of
lettuce, furry white baby seal, etc.
The psychologist would carefully
analyze the responses to each question
and then would refuse admittance to
every person, except those who know
Jerry Brown's mantra or S.I. Hayaka
wa's hat size.

I believe that we all must have
causes and I myself am no exception.
And wouldn't it be enormously
gratifying to have everyone else sup
port our personal causes? Certainly it
would; but it is just not possible.
What kind of world would it be if
everyone tried to "Save the Whales?"
Sea World might love the idea of hav
ing 300 understudies for Shamu, but
there are people whose livelihoods
depend upon killing a certain number
of these animals. Thus, causes are a
highly subjective matter.
