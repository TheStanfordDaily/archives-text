# Students complain
## Ballot amendments unclear 
### Sue Lesjak 
The constitutional amendment
changes as stated on the spring ballot
were unclear and discouraged "intel
ligent student voting," according to
two students.
"I don't see how you can count this.
The average voter doesn't know what
is going on," said Carter Lake, in refer
ence to the amendment changes. Law
son Fisher also complained about the
way the changes were presented on the
ballot.
The ballot read: "Be it enacted that
Article 11, Section 2, Paragraph G be
struck," without including a copy of
the article to be struck or any reasons
as to why they should be stricken.
Randy Bird, ASSU election commis
sioner, said copies of the constitu
tional amendment being voted on
could be obtained at the polls upon
request. The information was not au
tomatically given to voters, Bird
explained, because he didn't feel jus
tified in attaching the explanation
without senate approval.
"This is the way it's previously been
done," said Dave Sharp, senate chair
man, and any confusion that arose was
not due to "intentional sneakiness,"
but "oversight."
Sharp said it was too lato to include
an explanation of the amendments on
the run-off ballot but he promised to
mention the problem in his next
chairman's report to the senate in an
effort to avoid similar confusion in the
future.
Carole Houck, ASSU vice president
and leader of the SWOPSI class prop
osing the amendment changes, said
she was "aware of the problem," but
"it wasn't that big of a deal. I didn't
expect there to be a major explanation
on the ballot."
"It's my inclination that the election

is valid whether the amendment
changes pass or not," said Sharp. If the
amendment changes don't pass, they
can always be put on the ballot next
fall, Sharp said.
The amendments need to be struck
in order to adopt the governmental re
forms proposed by Houck's class. The
reforms will change the structure of
the Council of Presidents from a coun
cil of president and vice presidents to a
council of co-presidents.
The reforms will also establish sev
eral new committees. One new com
mittee, the Committee on Committees,
will assume, among other duties, those
of the present Nominations Commit
tee.
Bothered
Lake said he was bothered that the
ballot's clause to strike the Nomina
tions Committee was contingent on
the senate's ratification of certain
by-law changes. He said he felt the se
nate was trying to take away a constitu
tional right of the students and give it
to the senate.
"That's probably a valid point," re
plied Sharp.
According to Houck, however, "it
was definitely not their intention to
give the senate more control."
Whether the students pass the con
stitutional changes contingent on the
senate's action or vice versa, Houck
explained, "the outcome will be the
same."
Another problem with the ballot was
a misprint. In a section which should
have read: "Be it enacted that Article
11, Section 2, Paragraph G ... be
struck," the words "Paragraph G,"
were left out.
According to Bird, the mistake was
corrected as soon as it was discovered
by deleting the phrase, which wasn't
essential anyway because it was dup

licated in another section of the ballot.
The clause, as printed incorrectly,
would strike the whole senate mem
bership clause, said Sharp. "There'd
still be a senate but there'd be no provi
sions as to who would be a senator."
Sharp said he didn't feel this was a
problem, however, because "the se
nate never Dassed the mistake and so it
can't be on the ballot."
Bird said 1150 students voted yes
terday. He said he doubted the mis
take, which he called "very minor,"
would cause the senate to refuse to
ratify the election.
