# Electoral college poses complex problem
## 
### 
We have read a great deal in the
news of late regarding proposals to
scrap the Electoral College in favor of
presidential balloting by direct vote.
Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), a peren
nial advocate of dumping the plan de
vised by the constitutional framers,
now counts among his allies a rather
formidable figure: President Jimmy
Carter.
Advocates of the direct-vote scheme
are fond of invoking somewhat
simplistic slogans in support of their
cause, such as "one man, one vote, the
people must choose" and calling the
present system "undemocratic."
Senator Bayh, in a fit of passion no
doubt aroused after years of frustra
tion, has gone so far as to call the Elec
toral College "a form of electoral
roulette."
While such rhetoric may account for
the rising public support for the Bayh
plan, the issue cannot be reduced to
such elementary levels. It is an issue
which challenges the very core of our
constitutional government, and can
not be resolved without careful and
close examination of the advantages
and disadvantages of each system as
well as the long-run ramifications of
change.
Let us briefly examine the problems
opponents see in the present system,
and some possible solutions:
1) The "faithless elector." Oppo
nents of the Electoral College argue
that in close elections the will of the
people might be subverted by electors
who choose to vote other than their
states did. The solution to this problem
can be approached in two ways: the
electors could be bound by law, as
many states already do or one could
eliminate the chance of human error
by eliminating the humans. Simply as
sign unit electoral votes to the state
according to their vote, without the
formality of individuals assembling
and actually voting.
2) The popular vote winner loses. In
200 years, this has really occurred only
once, in 1888, by 91,000 votes.
Although opponents of the present

system point to 1824 and 1876 as well,
they are not legitimate examples — in
1824 there was no popular vote in six
states and no unit electoral vote in six
others.
In 1876. Tilden, the popular vote
winner, did have a majority in the elec
toral college — it was a fixed election
commission which chose Hayes. One
incident in two centuries of stable
democracy is hardly cause for demoli
tion of the entire system.

3) Small/large state advantages.
Opponents variously argue that the
Electoral College gives unfair advan
tage to the smaller or larger states. This
argument cuts across liberal and con
servative lines like no other in the
quandry of viewpoints.
The former argument runs that a
vote for an elector in Alaska counts
four times more than a vote in Califor
nia, giving the small states dispropor
tionate representation.
The latter runs that candidates con
centrate on the needs and wants of the
states with big blocs of electoral votes,
ignoring the smaller states. A sub
issue of the latter question, and one
that cannot be ignored, is the power
that minority blocs in the larger states
wield in close elections. Recently
Jewish leaders in New York de
nounced plans for change, and just last
Monday here at Stanford, Georgia rep
resentative Julian Bond warned
against any plan which would have
the effect of "fragmentation of the
black vote."

Any change must take into account
the constitutional ramifications and
delicate balances of power created to
protect majoritarian rule without con
sideration of minority viewpoint.
As Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote,
"Should some abstract standard of
equity require the abolition of large
state advantages in presidential elec
tions, then surely it requires the aboli
tion of small state advantages in the
composition of the senate."
A fundamental advantage of the
Electoral College system is the fact it
exaggerates the winners' margin of
victory and gives him the strength of a
mandate.
Imagine the consequences of a direct
election in 1960 if Kennedy had not
held a commanding electoral edge
over Richard Nixon and every precinct
in the nation had to recount when only
118,000 out of 68.5 million votes sepa
rated the two men.
The recount likely would have taken
months, involved protests and
counter-protests all across the nation
and left the leadership of the worlds'
strongest nation perilously in doubt
near the height of the Cold War.
As nationally-syndicated columnist
Ceorge F. Will wrote, "The genius of
the Constitution is the effect it has on
the character of majorities. The elec
toral college promotes unity and
legitimacy by helping to generate
majorities that are not narrow, geog
raphically or ideologically, and by
magnifying (as in 1960, 1968 and
1976) narrow margins of victories in
the popular vote."
This aspect of stability and preserva
tion of the two-party system is some
thing many opponents ignore. The
present system discourages factional,
one-issue or regional parties and
forces the two major parties to carry
states rather than merely win votes.
It strengthens the parties within the
states and the responsibility of state
and national candidates to their plat
forms and the minority considerations
that make them up.
As Harvard University Prof. William
Schneider, currently a visiting fellow
at the Hoover Institution, warns, "Poli
tics without parties is inevitably per
sonalized and irresponsible."
He points to the fact that presiden
tial elections are greatly influenced by
personality and campaign blunders,
and he points to the importance of
holding candidates responsible to his
party and its platform.
As demonstrated in 1972, when a
candidate ignores his party and its or
ganization, corruption results.

Professor Schneider points to the al
ready weakened condition of the
two-party system, "No one is going to
argue that the Electoral College by it
self can hold the system together. But
the abolition of the electoral college
may well be the last nail in the coffin,
obliterating even the formal role of
parties as institutions for democratic
control."
There are numerous arguments
which space does not allow us to con
sider here. The basis of the thesis es
poused herein is simply that numer
ous factors must be taken into account;
the question is one of awesome signifi
cance. Its long-range effects on our
very stability and survival cannot be
glossed over with coats of catchy slo
gans and sweeping, simplistic propos
als.
This is not to say that improvements
cannot be made in areas which we
have not been able to discuss here. But
rejection of the entire system is a dras
tic and perhaps, politically devastat
ing move.
As Arthur Schlesinger quotes Lord
Salisbury: "A violent, isolated artifi
cial improvement in the institutions of
a community, undertaken without re
gard to the conditions of other portions
of the machinery in concert with
which it is to work, is a danger so great
that no improvement at all is almost to
be preferred."
To put it more clearly, Professor
Schneider concludes, "If the house
suits you fine but the roof leaks, you
don't burn down the house. You fix the
roof."

that cannot be ignored, is the power
that minority blocs in the larger states
wield in close elections. Recently
Jewish leaders in New York de
nounced plans for change, and just last
Monday here at Stanford, Georgia rep
resentative Julian Bond warned
against any plan which would have
the effect of "fragmentation of the
black vote."

Any change must take into account
the constitutional ramifications and
delicate balances of power created to
protect majoritarian rule without con
sideration of minority viewpoint.
As Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote,
"Should some abstract standard of
equity require the abolition of large
state advantages in presidential elec
tions, then surely it requires the aboli
tion of small state advantages in the
composition of the senate."
A fundamental advantage of the
Electoral College system is the fact it
exaggerates the winners' margin of
victory and gives him the strength of a
mandate.
Imagine the consequences of a direct
election in 1960 if Kennedy had not
held a commanding electoral edge
over Richard Nixon and every precinct
in the nation had to recount when only
118,000 out of 68.5 million votes sepa
rated the two men.
The recount likely would have taken
months, involved protests and
counter-protests all across the nation
and left the leadership of the worlds'
strongest nation perilously in doubt
near the height of the Cold War.
As nationally-syndicated columnist
Ceorge F. Will wrote, "The genius of
the Constitution is the effect it has on
the character of majorities. The elec
toral college promotes unity and
legitimacy by helping to generate
majorities that are not narrow, geog
raphically or ideologically, and by
magnifying (as in 1960, 1968 and
1976) narrow margins of victories in
the popular vote."
This aspect of stability and preserva
tion of the two-party system is some
thing many opponents ignore. The
present system discourages factional,
one-issue or regional parties and
forces the two major parties to carry
states rather than merely win votes.
It strengthens the parties within the
states and the responsibility of state
and national candidates to their plat
forms and the minority considerations
that make them up.
As Harvard University Prof. William
Schneider, currently a visiting fellow
at the Hoover Institution, warns, "Poli
tics without parties is inevitably per
sonalized and irresponsible."
He points to the fact that presiden
tial elections are greatly influenced by
personality and campaign blunders,
and he points to the importance of
holding candidates responsible to his
party and its platform.
As demonstrated in 1972, when a
candidate ignores his party and its or
ganization, corruption results.

Professor Schneider points to the al
ready weakened condition of the
two-party system, "No one is going to
argue that the Electoral College by it
self can hold the system together. But
the abolition of the electoral college
may well be the last nail in the coffin,
obliterating even the formal role of
parties as institutions for democratic
control."
There are numerous arguments
which space does not allow us to con
sider here. The basis of the thesis es
poused herein is simply that numer
ous factors must be taken into account;
the question is one of awesome signifi
cance. Its long-range effects on our
very stability and survival cannot be
glossed over with coats of catchy slo
gans and sweeping, simplistic propos
als.
This is not to say that improvements
cannot be made in areas which we
have not been able to discuss here. But
rejection of the entire system is a dras
tic and perhaps, politically devastat
ing move.
As Arthur Schlesinger quotes Lord
Salisbury: "A violent, isolated artifi
cial improvement in the institutions of
a community, undertaken without re
gard to the conditions of other portions
of the machinery in concert with
which it is to work, is a danger so great
that no improvement at all is almost to
be preferred."
To put it more clearly, Professor
Schneider concludes, "If the house
suits you fine but the roof leaks, you
don't burn down the house. You fix the
roof."

We have read a great deal in the
news of late regarding proposals to
scrap the Electoral College in favor of
presidential balloting by direct vote.
Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), a peren
nial advocate of dumping the plan de
vised by the constitutional framers,
now counts among his allies a rather
formidable figure: President Jimmy
Carter.
Advocates of the direct-vote scheme
are fond of invoking somewhat
simplistic slogans in support of their
cause, such as "one man, one vote, the
people must choose" and calling the
present system "undemocratic."
Senator Bayh, in a fit of passion no
doubt aroused after years of frustra
tion, has gone so far as to call the Elec
toral College "a form of electoral
roulette."
While such rhetoric may account for
the rising public support for the Bayh
plan, the issue cannot be reduced to
such elementary levels. It is an issue
which challenges the very core of our
constitutional government, and can
not be resolved without careful and
close examination of the advantages
and disadvantages of each system as
well as the long-run ramifications of
change.
Let us briefly examine the problems
opponents see in the present system,
and some possible solutions:
1) The "faithless elector." Oppo
nents of the Electoral College argue
that in close elections the will of the
people might be subverted by electors
who choose to vote other than their
states did. The solution to this problem
can be approached in two ways: the
electors could be bound by law, as
many states already do or one could
eliminate the chance of human error
by eliminating the humans. Simply as
sign unit electoral votes to the state
according to their vote, without the
formality of individuals assembling
and actually voting.
2) The popular vote winner loses. In
200 years, this has really occurred only
once, in 1888, by 91,000 votes.
Although opponents of the present

system point to 1824 and 1876 as well,
they are not legitimate examples — in
1824 there was no popular vote in six
states and no unit electoral vote in six
others.
In 1876. Tilden, the popular vote
winner, did have a majority in the elec
toral college — it was a fixed election
commission which chose Hayes. One
incident in two centuries of stable
democracy is hardly cause for demoli
tion of the entire system.

3) Small/large state advantages.
Opponents variously argue that the
Electoral College gives unfair advan
tage to the smaller or larger states. This
argument cuts across liberal and con
servative lines like no other in the
quandry of viewpoints.
The former argument runs that a
vote for an elector in Alaska counts
four times more than a vote in Califor
nia, giving the small states dispropor
tionate representation.
The latter runs that candidates con
centrate on the needs and wants of the
states with big blocs of electoral votes,
ignoring the smaller states. A sub
issue of the latter question, and one
that cannot be ignored, is the power
that minority blocs in the larger states
wield in close elections. Recently
Jewish leaders in New York de
nounced plans for change, and just last

We have read a great deal in the
news of late regarding proposals to
scrap the Electoral College in favor of
presidential balloting by direct vote.
Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), a peren
nial advocate of dumping the plan de
vised by the constitutional framers,
now counts among his allies a rather
formidable figure: President Jimmy
Carter.
Advocates of the direct-vote scheme
are fond of invoking somewhat
simplistic slogans in support of their
cause, such as "one man, one vote, the
people must choose" and calling the
present system "undemocratic."
Senator Bayh, in a fit of passion no
doubt aroused after years of frustra
tion, has gone so far as to call the Elec
toral College "a form of electoral
roulette."
While such rhetoric may account for
the rising public support for the Bayh
plan, the issue cannot be reduced to
such elementary levels. It is an issue
which challenges the very core of our
constitutional government, and can
not be resolved without careful and
close examination of the advantages
and disadvantages of each system as
well as the long-run ramifications of
change.
Let us briefly examine the problems
opponents see in the present system,
and some possible solutions:
1) The "faithless elector." Oppo
nents of the Electoral College argue
that in close elections the will of the
people might be subverted by electors
who choose to vote other than their
states did. The solution to this problem
can be approached in two ways: the
electors could be bound by law, as
many states already do or one could
eliminate the chance of human error
by eliminating the humans. Simply as
sign unit electoral votes to the state
according to their vote, without the
formality of individuals assembling
and actually voting.
2) The popular vote winner loses. In
200 years, this has really occurred only
once, in 1888, by 91,000 votes.
Although opponents of the present

system point to 1824 and 1876 as well,
they are not legitimate examples — in
1824 there was no popular vote in six
states and no unit electoral vote in six
others.
In 1876. Tilden, the popular vote
winner, did have a majority in the elec
toral college — it was a fixed election
commission which chose Hayes. One
incident in two centuries of stable
democracy is hardly cause for demoli
tion of the entire system.

3) Small/large state advantages.
Opponents variously argue that the
Electoral College gives unfair advan
tage to the smaller or larger states. This
argument cuts across liberal and con
servative lines like no other in the
quandry of viewpoints.
The former argument runs that a
vote for an elector in Alaska counts
four times more than a vote in Califor
nia, giving the small states dispropor
tionate representation.
The latter runs that candidates con
centrate on the needs and wants of the
states with big blocs of electoral votes,
ignoring the smaller states. A sub
issue of the latter question, and one
that cannot be ignored, is the power
that minority blocs in the larger states
wield in close elections. Recently
Jewish leaders in New York de
nounced plans for change, and just last
Monday here at Stanford, Georgia rep
resentative Julian Bond warned
against any plan which would have
the effect of "fragmentation of the
black vote."

Any change must take into account
the constitutional ramifications and
delicate balances of power created to
protect majoritarian rule without con
sideration of minority viewpoint.
As Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote,
"Should some abstract standard of
equity require the abolition of large
state advantages in presidential elec
tions, then surely it requires the aboli
tion of small state advantages in the
composition of the senate."
A fundamental advantage of the
Electoral College system is the fact it
exaggerates the winners' margin of
victory and gives him the strength of a
mandate.
Imagine the consequences of a direct
election in 1960 if Kennedy had not
held a commanding electoral edge
over Richard Nixon and every precinct
in the nation had to recount when only
118,000 out of 68.5 million votes sepa
rated the two men.
The recount likely would have taken
months, involved protests and
counter-protests all across the nation
and left the leadership of the worlds'
strongest nation perilously in doubt
near the height of the Cold War.
As nationally-syndicated columnist
Ceorge F. Will wrote, "The genius of
the Constitution is the effect it has on
the character of majorities. The elec
toral college promotes unity and
legitimacy by helping to generate
majorities that are not narrow, geog
raphically or ideologically, and by
magnifying (as in 1960, 1968 and
1976) narrow margins of victories in
the popular vote."
This aspect of stability and preserva
tion of the two-party system is some
thing many opponents ignore. The
present system discourages factional,
one-issue or regional parties and
forces the two major parties to carry
states rather than merely win votes.
It strengthens the parties within the
states and the responsibility of state
and national candidates to their plat
forms and the minority considerations
that make them up.
As Harvard University Prof. William
Schneider, currently a visiting fellow
at the Hoover Institution, warns, "Poli
tics without parties is inevitably per
sonalized and irresponsible."
He points to the fact that presiden
tial elections are greatly influenced by
personality and campaign blunders,
and he points to the importance of
holding candidates responsible to his
party and its platform.
As demonstrated in 1972, when a
candidate ignores his party and its or
ganization, corruption results.

Professor Schneider points to the al
ready weakened condition of the
two-party system, "No one is going to
argue that the Electoral College by it
self can hold the system together. But
the abolition of the electoral college
may well be the last nail in the coffin,
obliterating even the formal role of
parties as institutions for democratic
control."
