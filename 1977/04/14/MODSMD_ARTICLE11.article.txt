One need only glimpse at the daily
newspaper to realize that the present
system of health care in America is
grossly inadequate.
The malpractice issue remains un
solved, costs continue to rise, and
many patients are dissatisfied with
their physicians. It is clear that the
situation cannot continue along its
present course, and the trend toward
some form of organized national
health care has already manifested it
self.
The controversial 1976 National
Health Care Act, which imposes strict
restraints on medical schools in
America, is but one recent example.
The pros and cons of socialized
medicine in this country have been
hotly debated for some time. While
opponents tend to back their argument
with apparent failure of such a plan in
Britain, the advantages of a well
organized American system would be
numerous.
Major goals would include a more
adequate geographical distribution of
doctors, quality health care to all re
gardless of economic status, training
of large numbers of physicians, and
elimination of currently overloaded
patient schedules faced by many doc
tors.
A plan successful in meeting these
goals requires that the physician's role
in society be equaled with that of other
public service employes. A taxpayer
supported government salary would
eliminate the existing financial incen
tive for over-scheduling on the part of
private physicians, allowing more

time for the needs of each patient and
less complaints regarding the rushed,
impersonal and non-caring manner of
doctors would undoubtably result.
In a public-oriented system, the dis
tribution problem might be solved at
the level of medical school admis
sions. Individuals who aspire to be
come policemen, for example, usually
do so with the knowledge that, upon
completion of training, they will be
placed in a particular (perhaps unde
sirable) area of the city.
Medical school applicants might be
required to make a similar commit
ment, thus solving the current prob
lems of numerous applications and as
sessment of applicant sincerity faced
by admissions committees.
A further improvement might in
clude public participation in the
evaluation of applicants; indeed, the
patient is in a better position to know
what constitutes a good doctor than
another physician.
The current physician shortage is
obviously most directly dealt with by
increasing the number of places in
existing medical schools, opening
new medical schools and facilitating
the return of qualified foreign-trained
students.
However, more efficient use of exist
ing training facilities might be made in
several ways. At present, choice of a
specialty is not made until several
years of learning have been completed,
much of which will never be used by
the individual in practice.
For example, an extensive course in

cardiovascular physiology is likely to
be of little use to a dermatologist. This
point obviously does not apply in
more general areas such as pediatrics,
surgery and internal medicine.
Nevertheless, the choice of a spe
cialty prior to medical school entrance
would allow tailoring of the individu
al's program to suit his/her particular
needs, with consequent shortening of
the duration of medical training and
the turning out of a greater number of
physicians per unit time.
One might justly argue that the aver
age pre-medical student lacks suffi
cient exposure to know which area of
medicine is particularly appealing.
However, in a socialized system, the
luxury of choice might have to be for
gone in favor of the needs of the public.
Medical schools could help elimi
nate the current shortage of primary
care physicians, for example, by prefe
rentially admitting those individuals
with a stated commitment to that par
ticular specialty.
Thus, it is clear that a well
organized national health care system
is desirable as well as feasible for
America. It must be emphasized that
such a plan, like any of comparable
magnitude, would not be without its
problems.
Most importantly, socialized
medicine would eliminate the mis
trust and animosity which has de
veloped between physician and pa
tient in recent years.

many patients are dissatisfied with
their physicians. It is clear that the
situation cannot continue along its
present course, and the trend toward
some form of organized national
health care has already manifested it
self.
The controversial 1976 National
Health Care Act, which imposes strict
restraints on medical schools in
America, is but one recent example.
The pros and cons of socialized
medicine in this country have been
hotly debated for some time. While
opponents tend to back their argument
with apparent failure of such a plan in
Britain, the advantages of a well
organized American system would be
numerous.
Major goals would include a more
adequate geographical distribution of
doctors, quality health care to all re
gardless of economic status, training
of large numbers of physicians, and
elimination of currently overloaded
patient schedules faced by many doc
tors.
A plan successful in meeting these
goals requires that the physician's role
in society be equaled with that of other
public service employes. A taxpayer
supported government salary would
eliminate the existing financial incen
tive for over-scheduling on the part of
private physicians, allowing more

time for the needs of each patient and
less complaints regarding the rushed,
impersonal and non-caring manner of
doctors would undoubtably result.
In a public-oriented system, the dis
tribution problem might be solved at
the level of medical school admis
sions. Individuals who aspire to be
come policemen, for example, usually
do so with the knowledge that, upon
completion of training, they will be
placed in a particular (perhaps unde
sirable) area of the city.
Medical school applicants might be
required to make a similar commit
ment, thus solving the current prob
lems of numerous applications and as
sessment of applicant sincerity faced
by admissions committees.
A further improvement might in
clude public participation in the
evaluation of applicants; indeed, the
patient is in a better position to know
what constitutes a good doctor than
another physician.
The current physician shortage is
obviously most directly dealt with by
increasing the number of places in
existing medical schools, opening
new medical schools and facilitating
the return of qualified foreign-trained
students.
However, more efficient use of exist
ing training facilities might be made in
several ways. At present, choice of a
specialty is not made until several
years of learning have been completed,
much of which will never be used by
the individual in practice.
For example, an extensive course in

cardiovascular physiology is likely to
be of little use to a dermatologist. This
point obviously does not apply in
more general areas such as pediatrics,
surgery and internal medicine.
Nevertheless, the choice of a spe
cialty prior to medical school entrance
would allow tailoring of the individu
al's program to suit his/her particular
needs, with consequent shortening of
the duration of medical training and
the turning out of a greater number of
physicians per unit time.
One might justly argue that the aver
age pre-medical student lacks suffi
cient exposure to know which area of
medicine is particularly appealing.
However, in a socialized system, the
luxury of choice might have to be for
gone in favor of the needs of the public.
Medical schools could help elimi
nate the current shortage of primary
care physicians, for example, by prefe
rentially admitting those individuals
with a stated commitment to that par
ticular specialty.
Thus, it is clear that a well
organized national health care system
is desirable as well as feasible for
America. It must be emphasized that
such a plan, like any of comparable
magnitude, would not be without its
problems.
Most importantly, socialized
medicine would eliminate the mis
trust and animosity which has de
veloped between physician and pa
tient in recent years.
