# Population up in South and West

### 
Washington (AP) â€” The only
major American cities gaining
population are located in the
South and West, the Census
Bureau reported yesterday.
Five of the nation's 10 largest
cities are now located in the
Southwest, due partly to a mig
ration from the older, declining
cities of the Northeast and Mid
west, the bureau said.
The bureau's 1975 estimates of
population show that of the 20
largest cities in the country, only
six have grown in population
since 1970. They are Houston,
San Diego, San Antonio, Hon
olulu, Phoenix and Memphis.
Populations dropped signific
antly from 1970 to 1975 in St.
Louis, with a drop of 15.6 per
cent; Cleveland, 14.9 per cent;
Minneapolis, 12.9 per cent; Buf
falo, 12 per cent; Pittsburgh, 11.8

per cent; Detroit, 11.8 per cent;
Newark, N.J., 11 per cent and
Cincinnati, nine per cent.
New York, the nation's largest
city, declined in population by
5.2 per cent. Its estimated 1975
population was 7,481,613 resi
dents. Chicago fell eight per cent
in the five-year period but re
mained the second-largest city
with 3,009,391 residents.
Third-ranked Los Angeles de
clined in population by three per
cent to 2,727,399.
Losses have also struck some
of the boom cities of the post
World War II era. Atlanta, Dallas,
Fort Worth, Seattle, Portland
and Denver were all on the list of
cities losing population in
1970-75.
However, some of them are
still the centers of growing urban
areas. While Dallas and Fort

Worth showed population de
clines, the suburbs of Garland
and Arlington each grew by
more than 20 per cent into cities
of more than 100,000 persons.
Each city has a different story,
but they share many problems,
said University of Illinois ur
banologist Pierre DeVise
when asked to comment on the
new list.
The declining cities often
achieved their prominence be
cause of water and rail transpor
tation that are no longer as im
portant to industry, he said. St.
Louis, Buffalo and Cleveland are
good examples.
Some, like San Francisco,
have limited land areas and have
been built to capacity. Now,
families are smaller and popula
tion density per dwelling unit
hus shrunk, he said.
