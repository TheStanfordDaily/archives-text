## Innovative aid for addicts 
### Don Waldron 
Office after carpeted office
greets the visitor as he walks
down shining hallways. The big
oaken doors open to reveal com
partments which might very
well contain stockbrokers if this
were an ordinary business.
But the business here is heroin
addiction treatment. The Addic
tion Research Foundation, lo
cated behind the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center, is one of
the most innovative heroin
treatment centers in the nation.
The innovation centers
around two experimental drugs
called LAAM (Levo-a lpha
acetyl-methadol) and nal
trexone. Although closely re
lated to methadone, LAAM is
much longer-acting, making it
much easier for the rehabilitated
addict to return to society. Nal
trexone, an opiate antagonist,
blocks the effects of heroin so
that even after heroin injection,
the naltrexone user can not get
high.
FDA-approved
Both LAAM and naltrexone
have been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)
only for experimental research.
Avram Goldstein, founder and
director of the four-year-old
foundation,is excited about their
prospects.
LAAM is superior to
methadone for several reasons,
Goldstein says. It is much longer
acting, making it necessary to
take doses only three times
weekly. Its smoother, sustained
drug effect eliminates the
euphoria characteristic of
methadone. Also, LAAM takes
effect later than methadone,
Since there is no immediate
high, LAAM is less attractive as a
street drug.
Until five years ago, there was
little research done on LAAM.
The drug industry was not in
terested because LAAM was not
patentable, having been in the
public domain for many years. In
1972, a federal task force plan
ned the development toward
approval by the FDA. The Ad
diction Research Foundation
began research on LAAM in
1973, the year of its founding.
LAAM is currently in "Phase
III" of testing. At this stage, the
drug is used among patients

similar to those in a general
clinic. Phase 111 is the last before
application can be made to the
FDA requesting approval to
market the drug. Once approved,
the manufacturer must continue
to report on any adverse reac
tions or toxicity which occurs.
Slow weaning
The method of rehabilitation
used at the Addiction Research
Foundation slowly weans the
addict away from not only the
drugs but also the lifestyle that
goes with it. Most important is
an addict's physical condition.
The two most common problems
of addicts are vein infections and
lack of weight.
To rehabilitate himself so
cially, the addict has to change
his attitudes toward communi
cation with other people, and
along with that break away from
his friends that use heroin.
Counselors at the clinic see pa
tients a half-hour weekly to help
them progress.
Breaking away from old
"shooting buddies" is very dif
ficult. They can easily lure an
ex-addict back into heroin use.
The biggest problem for the nar
cotic addict has never been de
toxification from heroin, but
rather remaining abstinent af
terwards, according to Barbara
judson, acting director of clini
cal research at the foundation.
Goldstein recalls a staff
member in a methadone clinic,
who for more than a year had
maintained on methadone and
hfld not shot up heroin. This man
confessed to him that he had just
a few minutes before been
shown a syringe and needle and
offered some heroin in the clinic
parking lot. He was unable to
control the craving for heroin,
and ended up with a needle back
in his arm.
Total abstinence
Abstinence from all drugs is
encouraged after detoxification
from LAAM, but for those in
danger of relapse to heroin use,
naltrexone is used. With nal
trexone, the ex-addict feels no
craving for heroin, even if he
sees someone shooting up.
The difficulty is getting pa
tients to go on to naltrexone.
After getting clean from LAAM,
many patients feel that they can
resist getting back on heroin. But

the high relapse rate shows the
difficulty of resisting the seduc
tiveness of heroin.
Patients on naltrexone come
in three times a week for their
doses for the first two weeks.
After that, the counselor, doctor
and patient decide when they
can have their first take-home
dose.
Take-home doses of nal
trexone do not have any black
market value because they do
not cause a high. Naltrexone is
neither addicting or habit
forming, so there are no with
drawal symptoms once it is
stopped.
Side effects
Although naltrexone has not
yet been found to be toxic, there
are some side effects in the gas
trointestinal system. Loss of ap
petite, nausea and vomiting, ab
dominal cramping and constipa
tion sometimes occur.
Patients must be highly moti
vated to continue using nal
trexone, says Goldstein. The
longest that patients have stayed
on the drug has been three to
four months, although the FDA
allows use up to one year during
the current phase of testing.
Naltrexone is in "Phase II"
testing, meaning that it is only
being used on a limited number
of patients. Women capable of
bearing children, for example,
are excluded from treatment.
Patients are not allowed to go
directly from being a street ad
dict to taking naltrexone, be
cause of the personal problems
that must be straightened out
first. To get on naltrexone, the
patient has to have been on
LAAM for three months, com
pletely free of any opiates.
And after naltrexone? Eventu
ally the post-addict faces a crisis
when he attempts to maintain
control when heroin is again av
ailable.
What comes after naltrexone
research at the foundation? The
foundation plans to apply the re
search on naltrexone to attack
ing the nicotine habit in the fu
ture. The brain may have
nicotine receptors equivalent to
opiate receptors, according to
Goldstein. Today, next to no
thing is known about the
specific ways nicotine affects the
cells of the brain.
