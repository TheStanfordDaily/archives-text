Faculty ghetto residents got a big surprise one morning last
week. Arising early, they were greeted with the spectacle
of miles and miles of "toilet tissue" encompassing every
thing from entire automobiles to entire houses: nothing

was spared. Three police cars arrived on the scene to
investigate. And who performed the crime? No one knows
for sure, but staff and faculty offspring are among the
leading suspects.
