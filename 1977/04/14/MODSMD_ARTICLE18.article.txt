Dear Duca: My roommate
and I get along great except
on one detail: she is a com
plete slob.
In our small room this is a
large drawback, and 1 really
want to talk to her about it. 1
don't think it's too much to
ask her to keep her part of the
room fairly tidy, yet any time
1 mention it to her or criticize
her in any way at all, she gets
very upset.
I am not asking her to make
any great sacrifices. Just to
pick up her clothes off the
floor, or make her bed once in
a while.
-Likes it Clean
Dear Clean: I couldn't
agree more: compromises
must always be reached when
sharing a flat, or a home, let
alone a single small room.
Still, try to be tactful about it

and help her unobstrusively
or keep some order, if only to
shame her a bit.
Also, use a little humor
with a deft approach, thus she
eventually will see the light
— I hope! —DUCA
Dear Duca: I own a 1967
Volkswagen. Most of my
friends have BMWs or Cadil
lacs. I'm embarrassed to drive
with them. Should I spend the
money or take a loan and get
a good car?
-Tim Lizzy
Dear Tim Lizzy: Nonsense
— if you will forgive me say
ing so! It is always childish
and frustrating to try and
keep up with the Jones' — buy
the car you can afford, and if
yourgirl friend doesn't like it.
she can walk! Or use a bike,
like everybody else.
