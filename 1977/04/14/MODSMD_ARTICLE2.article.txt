# Fighting erupts in Angola, Zambian village bombed
## 
### 
London (AP) — South African offi
cials yesterday reported fierce new in
ternal fighting in Angola, while Zam
bia charged that air force jets from
neighboring Zaire had crossed its bor
ders and bombed two villages and a
hospital.
The reports fed new tensions on a
continent simmering with ideological,
regional, tribal and racial confronta
tions.
The South African authorities in
Windhoek, capital of South-West Af
rica — Namibia — said about 700 black
refugees have fled south from Angola
in recent weeks to escape new fighting
between Cuban-backed government
troops and guerrillas of the Union for
the Total Independence of Angola —
UNIT A.
UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, was
one of two black nationalist factions
that battled against Agostinho Neto's
Marxist-oriented Popular Movement
— MP LA — during the civil war in the
former Portuguese colony.
The MP LA was declared winner of
the war last year, largely with the help
of Soviet arms and 12,000-15,000
Cuban troops, many of whom are still
in Angola. But UNITA has continued a
bitter guerrilla campaign in the south,
reportedly with strong support from
rural tribes.
Zaire blamed
The government of Angola's eastern
neighbor, Zambia, charged that jets of
the Zaire air force had crossed the un
marked bushland border once on
Saturday and twice on Monday, strik
ing two border villages and a mission
hospital. A spokesman said nothing
about casualties.
The bombings appeared to be a spil
lover of Zaire President Mobutu Sese
Seko's campaign against rebel exiles
who invaded from Angola last month
and have occupied a third of the
cop,>er-rich Shaba Province in south
western Zaire.
A contingent of 1500 elite Moroccan
troops sent by King Hassan II to bolster
Mobutu's badly organized forces were
digging in around the copper-mining
center of Kolwezi in the Shaba Pro

vince and consolidating their supply
lines, according to diplomatic sources
in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital.
No new moves
The invaders stopped their advance
about 50 miles west of Kolwezi and
have made no new moves for about 11
days. Reports from the occupied territ
ory said life was normal there as the
Katangan rebels and their tribal
brothers in Shaba worked to set up a
civil administration.
Mobutu has repeatedly claimed that
the invaders are backed by the Soviet
Union, Cuba and Angola. All three
have denied the charge, and some ob
servers have portrayed the invasion as
a renewed struggle by southwestern
Lunda tribesmen to wrest their
copper-rich land from Mobutu's cent
ral government.
Mobutu receives help
But Mobutu's pleas for help have
reached sympathetic ears among some
Western countries and anti-
Communist regimes in Africa. France
sent planes to transport the Moroccan
troops to Zaire, the United States sent
supplies and Egypt sent a military
fact-finding team to Zaire.
President Valery Giscard d'Eitaing
said France took the decision to send
planes to Mobutu without consulting
Washington. He described the move as
sending "signals of security and sol
idarity" to Europe's friends in Africa.
The U.S. government announced
Tuesday it is sending a second ship
ment of emergency aid to Mobutu — a
$9 million Cl3O plane and $4 million
in other "nonlethal" military equip

ment. The United States earlier sent $2
million in medicine and noncombat
military supplies.
The Egyptian government con
firmed that it had sent a military fact
finding mission to Zaire, but denied it
has made any commitment to send
troops or arms to prop up Mobutu.
In Paris, Angolan Foreign Minister
Paolo Jorge warned that Western in
tervention in Zaire "could have very
grave implications," and said if An
gola is attacked, "we will respond with
all our means to defend ourselves."
