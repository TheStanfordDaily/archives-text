# Senators try to recall finance head
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
Several senators who are members
of the Hammer & Coffin Society are
circulating a petition to recall ASSU
Financial Manager Chris Mathe, the
Daily learned yesterday.
As of 6:30 p.m. yesterday, the
senators had collected 1615 of the
1800 signatures needed, according to
Sen. Jeff Stoler, a Hammer & Coffin
member.
If the senators get the required
number of signatures, the petition will
go to the senate, where petition signa
tures will be checked to ensure their
validity.
If the legitimacy of the petition is
approved, it will go to Election Com
missioner Randy Bird, who lias six to
15 days to hold a recall election.
Reason given
According to Sen. Roy Skogstrom,
another Hammer & Coffin member, the
senators are circulating the petition
because Mathe has violated the senate
resolution passed Jan. 28. That resolu
tion said fee assessment refunds were
to be distributed in White Plaza by
student organizations instead of in the
ASSU office, where refunds have been
distributed previously.
Mathe, who began distributing re
funds from the ASSU office last Mon
day, explained that he did this because
of the "logistic problems" of the se
nate's resolution.
The senate resolution, he said, is
"undo-able" because it contains no
provision for how the White Plaza re
fund distribution should be executed,
The decision to violate the by-laws
was made with the complete approval
of Senate Chairman Dave Sharp,
Mathe said.
Skogstrom said he didn't think it
was the senate's responsibility to tell
Mathe how to execute the resolution.
"We feel since the finance manager
is a paid position, perhaps he could see
to it that arrangements are made," said
Skogstrom. "It's his responsibility."
'Dumb'
This idea is "dumb," Mathe said. He
said he was not willing to take respon
sibility for the $6000 that would be
placed in the hands of different stu
dent organizations because of the high
security risk.
"I'm not paid to take risks like that,"
he said. "My office would have to
police the whole operation."
Mathe speculated that Stoler was the
moving force behind the recall peti
tion.
"Hammer & Coffin and I have locked
horns several times," Mathe
explained. "I think they have a ven
detta."
ASSU President Vic Petroff said the
petition is "ridiculous. Mathe's deci
sion is reasonable."
Petroff said he doubted someone
else in Mathe's position would handle
the matter any differently.
Sen. Jon Barth, a member of Hammer
& Coffin, said he knew nothing about
the petition. The petition is "really
dumb," said Barth. "It's probably a
joke."
Skogstrom said that although he was
not "that associated with circulating
the petition," he thought the petition

was probably meant to be used as
"leverage" for forcing Mathe to exe
cute the senate resolution.
"If that doesn't work, it probably
will be used as a recall petition," said
Skogstrom.
"I doubt if I'd be in favor of a recall
election, though," he added.
"Time-wise, they'd have difficulty
getting the recall passed," said Bird.
He pointed out that there would prob
ably be no action until late in the quar
ter, when the issue would become
moot because Mathe's term ends in
June.
Bird estimated that a recall election
would cost $700 to $800. Two-thirds of
the persons voting must vote "yes" for
Mathe to be recalled, Bird said.
Bird said he though it would be "re
ally tough" to get two-thirds of the
voters to okay the recall.

This idea is "dumb," Mathe said. He
said he was not willing to take respon
sibility for the $6000 that would be
placed in the hands of different stu
dent organizations because of the high
security risk.
"I'm not paid to take risks like that,"
he said. "My office would have to
police the whole operation."
Mathe speculated that Stoler was the
moving force behind the recall peti
tion.
"Hammer & Coffin and I have locked
horns several times," Mathe
explained. "I think they have a ven
detta."
ASSU President Vic Petroff said the
petition is "ridiculous. Mathe's deci
sion is reasonable."
Petroff said he doubted someone
else in Mathe's position would handle
the matter any differently.
Sen. Jon Barth, a member of Hammer
& Coffin, said he knew nothing about
the petition. The petition is "really
dumb," said Barth. "It's probably a
joke."
Skogstrom said that although he was
not "that associated with circulating
the petition," he thought the petition

was probably meant to be used as
"leverage" for forcing Mathe to exe
cute the senate resolution.
"If that doesn't work, it probably
will be used as a recall petition," said
Skogstrom.
"I doubt if I'd be in favor of a recall
election, though," he added.
"Time-wise, they'd have difficulty
getting the recall passed," said Bird.
He pointed out that there would prob
ably be no action until late in the quar
ter, when the issue would become
moot because Mathe's term ends in
June.
Bird estimated that a recall election
would cost $700 to $800. Two-thirds of
the persons voting must vote "yes" for
Mathe to be recalled, Bird said.
Bird said he though it would be "re
ally tough" to get two-thirds of the
voters to okay the recall.
Several senators who are members
of the Hammer & Coffin Society are
circulating a petition to recall ASSU
Financial Manager Chris Mathe, the
Daily learned yesterday.
As of 6:30 p.m. yesterday, the
senators had collected 1615 of the
1800 signatures needed, according to
Sen. Jeff Stoler, a Hammer & Coffin
member.
If the senators get the required
number of signatures, the petition will
go to the senate, where petition signa
tures will be checked to ensure their
validity.
If the legitimacy of the petition is
approved, it will go to Election Com
missioner Randy Bird, who lias six to
15 days to hold a recall election.
Reason given
According to Sen. Roy Skogstrom,
another Hammer & Coffin member, the
senators are circulating the petition
because Mathe has violated the senate
resolution passed Jan. 28. That resolu
tion said fee assessment refunds were
to be distributed in White Plaza by
student organizations instead of in the
ASSU office, where refunds have been
distributed previously.
Mathe, who began distributing re
funds from the ASSU office last Mon
day, explained that he did this because
of the "logistic problems" of the se
nate's resolution.
The senate resolution, he said, is
"undo-able" because it contains no
provision for how the White Plaza re
fund distribution should be executed,
The decision to violate the by-laws
was made with the complete approval
of Senate Chairman Dave Sharp,
Mathe said.
Skogstrom said he didn't think it
was the senate's responsibility to tell
Mathe how to execute the resolution.
"We feel since the finance manager
is a paid position, perhaps he could see
to it that arrangements are made," said
Skogstrom. "It's his responsibility."
