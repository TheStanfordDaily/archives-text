## In search of paradise 
### 
Swiss director Barbet
Schroeder's new film, The Val
ley Obscured By Clouds, is about
a young married woman, Vivian
(Bulle Ogier), who journeys to
New Guinea in search of the
near-extinct Bird of Paradise
feathers she plans to send back
for sale to Paris boutiques. As
she is about to begin her search,
she meets several young adven
turers leaving on an expedition
into the bush country in search
of an unknown valley in the
phantom regions of the island
which are still nothing but blank
spots on the map . . . "obscured
by clouds."
Schroeder says ofhis film, "At
the beginning, The Valley was
the story of a woman's discovery
of life and pleasure. But pleasure
is a serious thing, ful 1 of anguish.
"The film realizes a transfor
mation and a journey of charac
ters who try to push themselves
to the limit, with all the risks
which that involves."
The film also features a
number of New Guinean Mapu

gan tribesmen in cameo roles.
There is one very beautiful scene
when the whites meet the na
tives and each group explores
and mingles with the other.
The beauty of the film lies in
its intimate exposure of primi
tive man and nature. And the
culture shock of the adventurers
is probably as strongly felt by
viewers as by the characters
themselves.
The film is not without prob
lems however, most of which lie
in Schroeder's attempts to be
profound. The journey is too
self-consciously symbolic, the
characters too shallow. The
character of Vivian only is
somewhat exempt from this
criticism; the other characters
suffer from a debilitating one
dimensionality. When they are
in danger of dying from exhaus
tion and starvation, they fail to
arouse sympathy.
One element of the film which
aggravates this difficulty is
Schroeder's depiction of the ad
venturers as hippies. He said he

chose this portrayal because
"hippies are the only contem
porary movement which has
produced a lunatic fringe filled
with a spirit of adventure."
The idea might have been fine
in 1972 when the film was first
released; in 1977, though, the
hippie concept is somewhat ef
fete.
But the major problem is still
the characters' lack of real
growth. To be sure, they open up
to personal experiences with the
natives and increase their sen
sual sensitivity while in the
jungle. Yet they are like
hedonists who sit down to a
huge feast and devour it with in
tense palliative pleasure, but are
not changed by the feast because
their appreciation remains on a
sensual level.
When they finally reach the
summit overlooking the hidden
valley, Schroeder seems to be
saying, "look, they've under
gone tremendous suffering and
through stripping down to life's
raw essentials they've arrived at
paradise, both internal and ex
ternal.
"Mind-blowing," Schroeder
would probably say. But mind
blowing is exactly what it isn't.
Sensual, "sensation-blowing,"
yes, and beautifully so. It's un
fortunate Schroeder couldn't
have left it at that and spared us
his profundity.

Francisco.)
