Union leaders urge import restrictions
Washington — Clothing union leaders and AFL
CIO President George Meany went to the White
House yesterday to give President Jimmy Carter the
same message union members were pushing in de
monstrations across the nation — clothing imports
are threatening American jobs.
Carter and Robert Strauss, the U.S. trade ambas
sador, met with the labor leaders for 35 minutes.
Sol Chaikin, president of the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union, said the labor leaders were
not seeking a ban on imports. Instead, he said, the
existing import restrictions on foreign-made clo
thing and textiles should be limited to the rate of
growth in the domestic industries.
Current trade agreements maintain a six per cent
growth level on imports, while the American indus
tries have been growing at only a three per cent
annual rate.
Saccharin sales may be restricted
Washington — The Food and Drug Administra
tion (FDA) will propose regulations today that
would ban saccharine as a food additive but permit
its sale as an over-the-counter drug, it was learned
yesterday.

Sources who declined to be identified said the
federal agency will make no final decision on the
over-the-counter proposal unless manufacturers of
the artificial sweetener can demonstrate that sac
charine meets all the requirements of a drug.
If saccharine were approved as a drug, it could be
sold over-the-counter like aspirin or other nonpres
cription drugs. However, it would be in pill or pow
der form.
It could not be sold as an ingredient in food or
drink.
Jack Walden, chief spokesman for the FDA, said
the agency today will formally publish the ban on
saccharine in foods and beverages.
The ban follows Canadian tests that showed the
sugar substitute can cause bladder cancer in laborat
ory rats.
The ban on saccharine as a food additive was re
quired by a law known as the "Delaney Amend
ment" which prohibits any substance to be added to
food if it is shown to cause cancer in humans or
animals.
Longshoremen strike hits shippers
Washington — The International Longshoremen's
Association (ILA) issued strike orders yesterday for a
midnight walkout against seven major shipping
companies at Atlantic and Gulf ports in a contract
dispute.
Labor Department officials met with lawyers for
both sides in the dispute, involving renegotiation of
a three year contract, but the session ended with no
report of progress.
ILA president Thomas Gleason, whose union rep
resents 35,000 dock workers from Maine to Texas,
said the strike would involve shipping at Atlantic
and Gulf coast ports.

lt appeared the ILA strike would be a selective
walkout, affecting the seven companies but leaving
others free to continue operations. A spokesman for
Gleason said the strike orders called on union mem
bers not to service ships of the seven lines after
midnight.
A spokesman for the Council for North Atlantic
Shipping Associations said the strike "will have a
substantial impact" since the targeted companies are
major lines handling containerized shipments.
Liberals seek to limit state death bill
Sacramento — Liberals opposed to the death pen
alty can't stop a capital punishment bill from passing
but will try to limit its scope, Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy said yesterday.
"If a death penalty bill is passed by the legislature,
it should be a re-enactment of the 1973 statute with
constitutional changes required by the Supreme
Court,"the San Francisco Democrat told reporters.
Without going into detail, he said a senate-passed
death penalty bill, by Sen. George Deukmejian (R-
Long Beach), goes farther than the 1973 law, which
was struck down by the state Supreme Court.
Both the bill and the former law impose the death
penalty for specified categories of murder, including
murder of a police officer, murder for hire and mur
der during a rape or robbery.
Deukmejian'sbill adds several categories, includ
ing torture killing, and also includes a new provision
that appeals from death sentences must be decided
within 150 days.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer tomorrow.
Lows in the 40s. Highs today 60 near the coast and
60s to low 70s inland and tomorrow 60s to mid 70s.
