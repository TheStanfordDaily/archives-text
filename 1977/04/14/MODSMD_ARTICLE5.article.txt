## 
### Gary Furlong 
Repercussions from yesterday's anti-Marine Corps pro
test rally at the Career Planning and Placement Center
began taking shape yesterday as both the police and the
protesters considered taking legal action against each other.
On the police side, Public Safety Director Marvin Her
rington has submitted the case to the Palo Alto District
Attorney's office for a decision on whether charges will be
pressed.
"We are aware of and reviewing the case now," Dep. Dist.
Atty. Tom Fahrenholz said yesterday. "However, we don't
anticipate any decision until next week at the earliest."
On the protesters' side, legal action is also being consi
dered, but only as a last resort. Chris Coleman, spokesman
for the group, held a meeting of the protesters yesterday to
decide on what action to take.
"We still believe we were not wrong and that Herrington
initiated the physical confrontation," Coleman said, voic
ing the consensus of the group. "We have established in
formal contact with a local law office, but we will resort to
our own legal action only as a last resort."
Coleman said, "Our preference is to have a meeting with
Herrington, Lyman and Rosenzweig to discuss the inci-

dent.We feel we deserve an explanation and clarification of
University policy relating to campus disruption and
specific police action."
The protesters are staying in contact with the law firm as a
precaution, according to Coleman. This is in response to
Herrington's having formally referred the case to the dis
trict attorney's office.
"We are not any less right just because we want to avoid
legal action," Coleman said. "We just don't want the hassle.
We have reviewed the penal code, however, and feel we
have a strong case anyway."
University officials have declined to take any action or
position on the affair.
"The University has not tried to dissuade Herrington
from taking evidence to the D.A.," President Richard
Lyman said. "The University wouldn't normally be in
volved in the police going to the district attorney. We
wouldn't interfere, as Mr. Herrington has other respon
sibilities than to Stanford."
Vice President of Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig was
more definite about University inaction, stating that the
University had no choice but to go along with Herrington's
decision.
