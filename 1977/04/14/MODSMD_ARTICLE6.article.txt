# Tourney features titillating trivia

### Mark Schleiss 
What was the name of the Green
Hornet's car?
What 19th century chemist prop
osed a resonance structure for ben
zene that is still used today?
In which newspaper did the
comic strip "Little Orphan Annie"
first appear?
If you answered "Black Beauty,"
Kekule and The New York
Herald-Tribune, then you probably
belong in the first annual Stanford
Trivia Bowl, a five-day tournament
to determine who has the greatest
storehouse of impractical know
ledge on campus.
The tournament, which began
Monday, is being held in the Tre
sidder upstairs lounge.
Forty-five teams entered the
tournament sponsored by the
newly-organized club SLUT (Stan
ford Lovers of Unusual Trivia).
Students, grad students, faculty
and staff are participating in teams
of four with such imaginative
names as "The Cedro Banana
Slugs," "The Cornholers," and
"Wasted Parrots."
The co-presidents and currently
the only members of SLUT are
juniors Bob Moog and Andy Baker.
Moog, a transfer student, adapted
the Trivia Bowl from a similar tour
nament at Colorado College.

Moog said the chief reason be
hind organizing a trivia tourney
was to give students a chance to do
something non-academic.
'Plain fun'
"Andy (Baker) and I were sitting
around one day and we decided
that Stanford students take life too
seriously. We wanted to give them a
chance to do something that'd be
just plain fun," Moog said.
Under the Trivia Bowl format,
two teams compete to answer a 10-
point toss-up question like "Who
was the only woman in Sherlock
Holmes' life?" or "What was the
name of the Walt Disney character
who synthesized flubber?"
A correct response to a toss-up
entitles a team to bonus questions
ranging in value from 20 to 40
points. Sample bonus questions
would include "Name eight of the
original Mousketeers" or "What
were the names of the people who
portrayed the Adams family?"
Moog said this point-awarding
procedure is essentially the same as
the one used at Colorado College
with one change — the audience
gets to answer any questions the
contestants miss.
"Our trivia contest has the addi
tional twist of the audience receiv
ing points for correct answers when
the contestants miss," Moog said.

"However, should the audience
win a match they do not advance
into the next round."
Writing questions
Moog said one major problem in
preparing for the tournament was
writing questions. Some questions
were taken from The Guiness Book
of World Records, the People's Al
manac and standard trivia books,
but according to Moog, most of the
nearly 1800 questions were written
by himself and Baker.
"We made up the vast majority of
the questions ourselves, and for the
final we'll use all our own ques
tions," Moog said.
With only Moog and Baker doing
the majority of the work, the project
has been extremely time
consuming.
"This quarter we've put more
time into this than our classes,"
Moog said. "I haven't even bought
my books yet. Fortunately, the Tre
sidder program board has helped us
out immensely with publicity, and
I'm very happy with the outcome of
the tournament."
Baker said he had mixed emo
tions about the overall success of
the Trivia Bowl.
The final rounds and champion
ship game wil 1 he tomorrow from 7
to 10 p.m. in the Tresidder upstairs
lounge (Rooms 281-282).

What 19th century chemist prop
osed a resonance structure for ben
zene that is still used today?
In which newspaper did the
comic strip "Little Orphan Annie"
first appear?
If you answered "Black Beauty,"
Kekule and The New York
Herald-Tribune, then you probably
belong in the first annual Stanford
Trivia Bowl, a five-day tournament
to determine who has the greatest
storehouse of impractical know
ledge on campus.
The tournament, which began
Monday, is being held in the Tre
sidder upstairs lounge.
Forty-five teams entered the
tournament sponsored by the
newly-organized club SLUT (Stan
ford Lovers of Unusual Trivia).
Students, grad students, faculty
and staff are participating in teams
of four with such imaginative
names as "The Cedro Banana
Slugs," "The Cornholers," and
"Wasted Parrots."
The co-presidents and currently
the only members of SLUT are
juniors Bob Moog and Andy Baker.
Moog, a transfer student, adapted
the Trivia Bowl from a similar tour
nament at Colorado College.

Moog said the chief reason be
hind organizing a trivia tourney
was to give students a chance to do
something non-academic.
'Plain fun'
"Andy (Baker) and I were sitting
around one day and we decided
that Stanford students take life too
seriously. We wanted to give them a
chance to do something that'd be
just plain fun," Moog said.
Under the Trivia Bowl format,
two teams compete to answer a 10-
point toss-up question like "Who
was the only woman in Sherlock
Holmes' life?" or "What was the
name of the Walt Disney character
who synthesized flubber?"
A correct response to a toss-up
entitles a team to bonus questions
ranging in value from 20 to 40
points. Sample bonus questions
would include "Name eight of the
original Mousketeers" or "What
were the names of the people who
portrayed the Adams family?"
Moog said this point-awarding
procedure is essentially the same as
the one used at Colorado College
with one change — the audience
gets to answer any questions the
contestants miss.
"Our trivia contest has the addi
tional twist of the audience receiv
ing points for correct answers when
the contestants miss," Moog said.

"However, should the audience
win a match they do not advance
into the next round."
Writing questions
Moog said one major problem in
preparing for the tournament was
writing questions. Some questions
were taken from The Guiness Book
of World Records, the People's Al
manac and standard trivia books,
but according to Moog, most of the
nearly 1800 questions were written
by himself and Baker.
"We made up the vast majority of
the questions ourselves, and for the
final we'll use all our own ques
tions," Moog said.
With only Moog and Baker doing
the majority of the work, the project
has been extremely time
consuming.
"This quarter we've put more
time into this than our classes,"
Moog said. "I haven't even bought
my books yet. Fortunately, the Tre
sidder program board has helped us
out immensely with publicity, and
I'm very happy with the outcome of
the tournament."
Baker said he had mixed emo
tions about the overall success of
the Trivia Bowl.
The final rounds and champion
ship game wil 1 he tomorrow from 7
to 10 p.m. in the Tresidder upstairs
lounge (Rooms 281-282).
