## Opinions Editorial Mathe recall 
### 
We condemn efforts by certain ASSU senators to recall ASSU
Financial Manager Chris Mathe in the wake of his prudent refusal
to carry out a senate resolution calling for fee assessment refunds
to be given out in White Plaza.
The actions of Hammer and Coffin slate senators, who have
been circulating petitions for a recall election, show a disregard
for common sense and reasonable compromise.
Under normal circumstances, the financial manager should
have no trouble following senate mandates, and Mathe has not, in
the past, been unreasonable in his dealings with either the senate
or the ASSU Council of Presidents.
But the senate's Jan. 28 resolution, calling for thousands of
dollars in refunds to be passed out at White Plaza tables with no
provision for security, passes the limits of reasonable mandate.
We believe Mathe was correct in continuing the practice of
handing out refunds inside the ASSU offices at Tresidder Union
until the senate could meet again to reconsider the logistics of its
proposal.
But before the senate could meet with Mathe to talk over the
problem, recall petitions have already begun to be circulated. This
premature rejection of a compromise solution is contemptible.
The position of financial manager is one of trust. Mathe is not
merely an employe of the senate but is an ASSU constitutional
officer appointed by a special ASSU committee and confirmed by
the senate. His opinion on ASSU financial matters is not to be
taken lightly, nor are his attempts to safeguard ASSU funds to be
rejected out of hand. Certainly his conscientious refusal to abide
by a resolution he believes threatens the security both of ASSU
funds and employes is no ground for recall.
The charge by Hammer and Coffin Sen. Jon Barth that Mathe's
position is an attempt to "discourage students from getting their
refunds" is equally ridiculous. Each student receives full refund
information on his or her permit to register, notice is given in the
Daily during the refund period, and thousands of students have in
the past been able to find their way to the ASSU office for their
refunds.
Mathe's sole concern in this dispute has been safety. To attempt
his removal before any discussion of the logistics problem he has
brought up is to reject reason and to engage instead in demagogic
nonsense.
