Burros
I would like to set the "Members of
the Alliance to Save the Burros of
Death Valley" (Daily, April 12)
straight on a few facts concerning the
Death Valley burros.
These burros are descendants of
pack animals released by miners early
in this century, and are considered by
many to be a "living heritage" of the
Old West.
However, having spent a great deal
of my time during the past three years
working on ecological studies in Death
Valley, I have witnessed the destruc
tive potential of the prolific Equus
asinus on a delicate desert environ
ment.
Drying up scarce water holes, de
struction of rare Desert Bighorn Sheep
habitat, and overgrazing of already
struggling desert vegetation are some
of the problems burros are responsible
for in Death Valley.
If the "Burro Alliance" members
were really informed "nature lovers,"
they would favor a pristine desert en
vironment over ecological encroach
ment byburros. And they could still do
their part to save burros — part of the
Department of the Interior's burros
control program includes giving away
burros as pets to anyone interested.
So how about riding to classes on
your very own asses, members of the
"Burro Alliance?"

Egg hunt
I feel a need to explain to the Stan
ford community what happened with
the Easter egg hunt at Tresidder Union
on April 8.1 feel that need because at 7
a.m., when about 200 people showed
up to look for the 119 prize eggs that
had been hidden before dawn, most of
the eggs were already gone.
What happened was that at about 6
a.m., groups of children arrived and
began collecting bagsful of eggs. We
did not anticipate children's participa
tion, since the advertising had indi
cated that it was to be an adult hunt.
To date, only 60 eggs have been
turned in, and we mustassumethatthe
remaining 59 are lost. This is an unfor
tunate fact, and one for which we
apologize to the students, faculty and
staff members who were here looking
for eggs at 7 a.m.
We'd like to do the hunt again next
year, since it seems apparent that
people are interested in participating.
If you have any suggestions on how
best to structure the event, we would
welcome your call at 497-4331.

Collision
Having been injured on this campus
early last month in a bike accident that
left me lying in a pool of blood, with
my nose broken in five places, I would
like to register a protest against the
speed at which certain individuals
race around Stanford.

Not too long ago, as I recall, a stu
dent died from injuries sustained alter
two bikes had collided.
At the same time, I wish to thank the
anonymous young lady and young
gentleman (both students) who offered
their jackets to keep me warm before
the paramedics arrived. I would like to
express my gratitude in person, if they
will contact me.

Confused
Perhaps 1 am a bit confused. ROTC
here was officially discontinued in
1970. Fine. But then it is reported
(Daily, April 7) that the University of
Santa Clara ROTC is holding classes in
Stanford classrooms for Stanford stu
dents, who happen to receive the same
benefits as any other ROTC cadets —
free tuition and books, plus $100 a
month. Now, no matter what they call
it, Stanford students in Stanford clas
srooms getting ROTC instruction,
commissions and money sounds a lot
like Stanford ROTC to me!
