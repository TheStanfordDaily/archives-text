## 
### Debbie Gong-Guy Randy Keith 
The Glenn Jordan slate apparently
won the Council of Presidents (COP)
election last night with 50.08 per cent
oi the fewest number ot votes cast in at
least the last seven years.
The Jordan slate missed a run-off
with the Rodney Johnson slate by two
votes. The Johnson slate conceded
with 34.4 per cent of the vote although
the returns from Tours and Hopkins
Marine Station were not included in
the total.
The ASSU Senate must ratify the
vote before it becomes official.
The Clark Sterling and Mike Delapa
senior officer slates will face each
other in a run-off election next week.
Sterling, Beverly Standing and Pam
Strike edged out Delapa, Diane Hu,
Him Moroney and Cathy Person, 128-
124.
The losing slates garnered the fol
lowing number of votes: Rodriguez,
104; Marenzi, 102; Mennis, 79; Kanin,
76; and Barth, 74.
With only 23 per cent of the student
body voting, COP candidate Jordan
and running mates Greg Larson, Anne
Henkels and Steve Westly won 1243
votes. The Johnson slate garnered 853
votes.

Brad Krevoy, running with Kim
Nyegaard and Fran Furtner on the
Johnson ticket, said the slate decided
to concede although the results from
Tours and Hopkins had not yet ar
rived.
Krevoy said, "We wish them (the
Jordan slate) the best of luck and hope
that they'll pursue some of the things
we raised in the campaign."
Larson said, "We do think many of
their ideas were particularly good, for
example the issue of Dead Week. That
there is student support for some parts

of their platform is obvious due to the
vote they received. We were disap
pointed however at the low voter turn
out."
Docters slate
The slate of Robert Docters. Leslie
Brettell, Larry Berz and Peter
Hausknecht received 199 votes (eight
per cent) and the Alex Alben, Carl
Danner, Rob Holbrook and Ron Mar

the vote.

votes have not been counted, the slate was declared the
winner with 50.08 per cent of the vote when the Johnson
slate, coming in second with 34.4 per cent, conceded
defeat. It is the first time since the spring of 1973 that a
slate has won without a run-off.


Close call

tain them, students stayed away from the polls yester
day. As of noon, less than 20 per cent of the student
body had voted. All fee assessments would have au-
