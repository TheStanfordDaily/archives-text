### Debbie Gong-Guy Randy Keith 
The Glenn Jordan slate apparently
won the Council of Presidents (COP)
election last night with 50.08 per cent
oi the fewest number ot votes cast in at
least the last seven years.
The Jordan slate missed a run-off
with the Rodney Johnson slate by two
votes. The Johnson slate conceded

the returns from Tours and Hopkins
Marine Station were not included in
the total.
The ASSU Senate must ratify the
vote before it becomes official.
The Clark Sterling and Mike Delapa
senior officer slates will face each
other in a run-off election next week.

The losing slates garnered the fol
lowing number of votes: Rodriguez,
104; Marenzi, 102; Mennis, 79; Kanin,
76; and Barth, 74.
With only 23 per cent of the student
body voting, COP candidate Jordan
and running mates Greg Larson, Anne
Henkels and Steve Westly won 1243
votes. The Johnson slate garnered 853
votes.

Brad Krevoy, running with Kim
Nyegaard and Fran Furtner on the
Johnson ticket, said the slate decided
to concede although the results from
Tours and Hopkins had not yet ar
rived.
Krevoy said, "We wish them (the
Jordan slate) the best of luck and hope
that they'll pursue some of the things
we raised in the campaign."
Larson said, "We do think many of
their ideas were particularly good, for
example the issue of Dead Week. That
there is student support for some parts

of their platform is obvious due to the
vote they received. We were disap
pointed however at the low voter turn
out."
Docters slate
The slate of Robert Docters. Leslie
Brettell, Larry Berz and Peter
Hausknecht received 199 votes (eight

85.3 per cent of the students voting in

"yes" vote. The vote was 1960 "yes"
and 545 "no."
The ASSIJ Course Guide garnered
an 77.7 per cent "yes" vote and will

votes have not been counted, the slate was declared the
winner with 50.08 per cent of the vote when the Johnson
slate, coming in second with 34.4 per cent, conceded
defeat. It is the first time since the spring of 1973 that a
slate has won without a run-off.


Close call
Even with the KZSU-sponsored band, Alexis, to enter
tain them, students stayed away from the polls yester
day. As of noon, less than 20 per cent of the student
body had voted. All fee assessments would have au-

cast their ballots. When the votes were tallied, 23 per
cent of the student body had voted and all fee assess
ments passed.
"yes ' to 848 "no."

vote. The $1 assessment will fund any
guest professors that the board invites
here. The vote was 1372 "yes" to 1084
"no."
Straw poll
Students vehemently opposed all
four straw poll ballot measures. Only
38 per cent of those voting favored a
Western Civilization requirement as a
part of the undergraduate curriculum.
Thirty-five per cent of the voters fa
vored the institution of a foreign lan
guage requirement.
The two referenda dealing with

vote was 1278 "yes" votes to 289 "no"
votes.

large margin. The measure received a

ing "yes" and 364 voting "no."
The amendment requires three

members of the council to sign a veto
before it becomes effective. Under the
old system only the president had to

feated because it did not receive the
required two-thirds vote. Sixty per
cent of the students voted in favor ot

ity.

here. The vote was 1372 "yes" to 1084

part of the undergraduate curriculum.
Thirty-five per cent of the voters fa
vored the institution of a foreign lan
guage requirement.
The two referenda dealing with

old system only the president had to
sign the vetoes.
An amendment to delete all sexist
wording from the Constitution was de
feated because it did not receive the

cent of the students voted in favor ot

ity.

With only 23 per cent of the student
body voting, COP candidate Jordan
and running mates Greg Larson, Anne
Henkels and Steve Westly won 1243

Tours and Hopkins had not yet ar
rived.
Krevoy said, "We wish them (the
Jordan slate) the best of luck and hope
that they'll pursue some of the things
we raised in the campaign."
Larson said, "We do think many of
their ideas were particularly good, for
example the issue of Dead Week. That
there is student support for some parts

of their platform is obvious due to the
vote they received. We were disap
pointed however at the low voter turn
out."

"yes" to 767 "no."
Undergraduate student associations

—Dally photo by Juke Fiedler
votes have not been counted, the slate was declared the
winner with 50.08 per cent of the vote when the Johnson
slate, coming in second with 34.4 per cent, conceded
defeat. It is the first time since the spring of 1973 that a
slate has won without a run-off.


Close call
Even with the KZSU-sponsored band, Alexis, to enter
tain them, students stayed away from the polls yester
day. As of noon, less than 20 per cent of the student
body had voted. All fee assessments would have au-

cast their ballots. When the votes were tallied, 23 per
cent of the student body had voted and all fee assess
ments passed.
"yes ' to 848 "no."
The guest professorship board fee
assessment passed by the smallest
margin receiving a 55.9 percent "yes"
vote. The $1 assessment will fund any
guest professors that the board invites
here. The vote was 1372 "yes" to 1084
"no."

38 per cent of those voting favored a
Western Civilization requirement as a
part of the undergraduate curriculum.
Thirty-five per cent of the voters fa
vored the institution of a foreign lan
guage requirement.
The two referenda dealing with
making the fee assessments voluntary
received almost no support. Only 19

The amendment requires three

before it becomes effective. Under the
old system only the president had to
sign the vetoes.
An amendment to delete all sexist
wording from the Constitution was de
feated because it did not receive the
required two-thirds vote. Sixty per
cent of the students voted in favor ot

have eliminated sections of the Con
stitution were also defeated because
they did not have the necessary major
ity.

oi the fewest number ot votes cast in at

votes. The Johnson slate conceded

Marine Station were not included in
the total.
The ASSU Senate must ratify the
vote before it becomes official.

The losing slates garnered the fol
lowing number of votes: Rodriguez,
104; Marenzi, 102; Mennis, 79; Kanin,
76; and Barth, 74.
With only 23 per cent of the student
body voting, COP candidate Jordan
and running mates Greg Larson, Anne
Henkels and Steve Westly won 1243
votes. The Johnson slate garnered 853
votes.

Brad Krevoy, running with Kim
Nyegaard and Fran Furtner on the
Johnson ticket, said the slate decided

Tours and Hopkins had not yet ar
rived.
Krevoy said, "We wish them (the
Jordan slate) the best of luck and hope
that they'll pursue some of the things
we raised in the campaign."
Larson said, "We do think many of
their ideas were particularly good, for
example the issue of Dead Week. That
there is student support for some parts

of their platform is obvious due to the
vote they received. We were disap
pointed however at the low voter turn
out."
Docters slate
The slate of Robert Docters. Leslie
Brettell, Larry Berz and Peter
