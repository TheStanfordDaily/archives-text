# Out with the truth

The student zips some paper into his
typewriter. He has only four hours to
write, edit and hand in a 5000-word
English composition.
He begins, "The sun was shining,
the birds were chirping. He was in a
gay mood." The creative process
quickly grinds to a halt. Is the charac
ter in a happy mood, or has he been
stricken with an infatuation for mem
bers of his own sex? With grades at

stake, what is the poor student author
to do when words change meaning?
This dilemma exemplifies the trou
bles students encounter when faced
with the steadily, albeit imperceptible
changes that plague our most noble
English language. It is only at great
risk to life, limb and grade point aver
age that one can turn a blind eye to
modifications in word usage and
grammar, for we must run the linguis
tic guantlet almost daily.
Some of you are probably doubting
the gravity of the issue 1 raise. "Who
cares?" you scoff.
Take the example of gay. An aging
prof who reads the aforementioned
example would see no problems with
the student's word usage and would
probably give him an A for his deft
prose.
But the modern, hep professor, in
tune with the latest changes in word
usage, would "bleed" all over the stu
dent's paper, bellowing that a charac
ter's sexual preference have nothing to
do with the quality of the day. Again,
what is the poor student author to do
when words change meaning?
Do not despair. By examining how
the meanings of several key words
have changed, the student can learn
how to understand and even manipu
late his professors' thinking for
bounteous good grades.
Truth: formerly, this was a quality
which a proposition had if it cohered
to the realities of the real world. Truth
was thought to be absolute, universal
and unchanging. Modern thinkers
have rejected this archaic notion and
have opted for the concept of relative
truth. Basically, this position holds
that what is true for you is not neces
sarily true for someone else.
Although almost everyone today
adheres to this concept of relative
truth, many are not thoroughly consis
tent with the view. Some people still
laughingly make statements like, "Hi

tier was wrong" or "the Vietnam War
was evil." Remember, what you might
condemn as "wrong" might be just
fine for someone else. Who are you to
judge? Many people are trying to snuft
out the last vestiges of this arrogant
and pejorative thinking.
Likewise, narrow-minded bank
employes will call a person's check
"bad," rather than grant thecheckwri
ter the validity of his convictions that
he has $1,000,000 in his account. For
tunately, this sort of provincial think
ing has been expunged from most uni
versities in recent years.
Professor: this term once referred to
a person who espoused or "professed"
one position over another because he
thought it to be true. From the previous
section on truth, it should be abun
dantly clear that this is untenable.
Nowadays, professors are careful to be
openminded and not to "ram their
own views down the students'
throats."
But these newer views of relative
truth provide ample opportunity to
weedle straight As out of professors
with nothing but contrived baloney on
essay tests.
Proceed as follows: if a prof starts
deprecating your views as being too
dogmatic or narrow, assume a bewil
dered expression and say, "You don't
agree? I hope this won't count against
me that we hold different opinions or
do you only want us to restate your
viewpoint?"
Or, let's say you get an essay exam
which stipulates, "Any perspective is
permissible, as long as it is adequately
supported." Again, strike for easy As
by asking, "Are you looking for
reasons which are convincing to you
or are we free to express the supports
which are most compelling to us?"
If done correctly, these two ploys
will appeal to the profs sense of fair
play, not to mention obfuscating the
entire situation much to your advan
tage. Any professor who disagrees
with you will now bend over back
wards to make sure he is not grading
you down because he disagrees with
you. This means you will be able to say
virtually anything you want and stfll
get a B.
Words keep changing, but they
don't have to cause any student to fal
ter at school. Manipulation of profes
sors who profess nothing, truth that is
relative and, in general, a liberal edu
cation which admits no conviction is
the easiest way to good grades at any
institute of higher learning. But if
you've come to college looking for
truth, I guess you'll just have to look
somewhere else.
