# Reviewing the first 100 days
## Carter administration: slow but steady progressivism 
### 
Peter Stamos

"All this will not be finished
in the first one hundred days.
Nor will it be finished in the first
one thousand days, nor in the
life of this Administration, nor
even perhaps in our lifetime on
this planet. But let us begin."
—John Kennedy, 1961
John Kennedy's first 100 days
launched America into the dynamic
19605. It was a decade of progress and
failure, of dreams and despair. Unfor
tunately, the bright, promising goals of
the New Frontier were prematurely si
lenced by an assassin's bullet then hur
ried under the tragic legacy of the Vie
tnam War.
But Vietnam is behind us. The
"heat" of the cold war is behind us and
"to the best of my recollection" Water
gate is behind us. So let us begin. One
hundred days is long enough for a new
beginning, and although President
Jimmy Carter has had less than 80 days
to start his first 100, necessity calls for
an early evaluation.
List of dreams
Immediately after his election, Car
ter expressed the desire to be a "great
president." Later in his inaugural ad
dress he outlined a long list of ideal
goals for the future: providing
employment for those who can work,
attaining equality under the law, pro
tecting human rights at home and a
broad, eliminating nuclear weapons,
strengthening the American family,
building lasting peace and restoring
trust in government and in the Ameri
can Dream.
Indeed, if half of these goals are even
partially fulfilled, Carter will achieve
greatness. However, a great president
must not only outline the issues of the
day; he must confront these issues
with unending energy, devotion and
innovation. A president is backed by
the substance of his policy and the"
style of his approach.
Style is best exemplified by the abil
ity to "set a tone." Perhaps the most
pervasive method of setting a tone in
modern American politics has been to
project a style of change, progress and
the all powerful "New."

We've had Woodrow Wilson's New
Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt's New
Deal, John Kennedy's New Frontier
and now Jimmy Caiter's New Spirit —
"a fresh faith in the old dream." Presi
dential idealism and goal setting are
important for they capture the purpose
and imagination of the American
people.
Moreover, effective policy requires
that this style be coordinated with real
ity. To evaluate Carter's New Spirit, it
is essential to analyze exactly what has
been achieved and set forth by this
young administration.
Economy
Carter repeatedly raised the issues of
unemployment and inflation during
the 1976 campaign. With 10 million
people unemployed and an annual in
flation rate of over five per cent, these
problems remain paramount today.
The Carter administration has prop
osed a carefully designed combination
of fiscal and monetary policies to
ameliorate the situation.
The economic stimulus package is
two fold: first, a quick expansion of
public buying power through tax cuts
and rebates; second, a gradual step-up
in government spending aimed at in
creasing public works, public service
jobs and private sector job growth.
Ninety per cent of the 1977 $15 billion
extra government stimulus will be
provided through tax rebates and in
come tax adjustments, while govern
ment spending programs will be
phased in toward the end of 1977 and
increased through 1978.
To finance the $70 billion deficit for
1977 (a $10 billion full employment
deficit) the administration must take
care not to crowd out private investors
by overborrowing from the commer
cial banking system. Carter must estab
lish better monetary relations with the
Federal Reserve Board to make sure
the money supply keeps pace with the
proposed six per cent real growth rate.
Carter's ability to revitalize the
economy will perhaps be the basis for
his potential success or failure in meet
ing the demands of the country. To this
date Carter has offered a balanced ap

proach and the economy seems to be
on the upswing.
Energy
Another focal point is a credible na
tional energy policy. With growing
U.S. dependence on foreign oil and
depletion of already scarce domestic
oil reserves, the No. 1 energy concern
has been to consolidate government
energy programs and to aim for con
servation and efficiency. Carter has
proposed the adoption of a Cabinet
level Department of Energy which
would combine the Federal Energy
Administration, the Energy Research
and Development Administration and
the Energy Resources Council.
Added to this, by April 20 Carter
will present a comprehensive energy
plan. Carter's plan promises to call for
both development and conservation
while maintaining "price protection
for the consumer." We can expect tax
incentives and subsidies for efficient
energy use including a sliding-scale
tax that will benefit producers and
buyers of fuel efficient automobiles
and penalize "gas guzzlers."
If Carter can hold fast to his pledge to
protect the environment while de
creasing U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources, his accomplishment
will be impressive. The price, how
ever. will have to be paid by current
energy abusers (including more of us
than one might expect) and this may
mean using less while paying more.
Foreign Policy
On his first day of official duty the
president started both domestic and
foreign policy on the right note by par
doning the 13,000 Vietnam draft evad
ers. In addition the past two months
have shown that the U.S. is attempting
to heal its wounds throughout the
world.
As a result there is hope that nor
malization of relations will be sought
with Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea
and Cuba. Steps have been taken to
regain the confidence of our European
allies while maintaining the long
range goal of lowering the level of
NATO and Warsaw Pact arms in
Europe through proposed Mutual Ba

lanced Force Reduction talks in Vie
nna.
The most indicative aspect of the
change in American foreign affairs has
been displayed by the recent flourish
of open, candid remarks by Carter and
United Nations Ambassador Andrew
Young. Carter and Young have unceas
ingly called for improved human
rights conditions attacking the records
of allies and adversaries alike.
This openness and candor has been
extended throughout U.S. foreign pol
icy. For example, two weeks ago in an
almost off-the-cuff manner Carter ex
pressed his belief that a Middle East
settlement and the establishment of a
complete peace would require Israel to
return most of the Arab land occupied
since the 1967 war.
Such direct remarks by an American
president are unprecedented and yet
Carter has been equally unequivocal in
the U.S. position toward Rhodesia, the
situation in Africa and relations with
the Soviet Union.
The only negative point out of all
this candor has been the recent setback
of U.S.-Soviet arms limitations talks,
but Carter says the renewed discus
sions in May will bring progress.
Moral leadership
The prevailing theme of these open
ing months of the Carter administra
tion has been morality and trust in
government. Carter has made a
genuine effort to renew the public's
faith in its leaders.
The president's symbolic gestures
such as walking down Pennsylvania
Avenue on Inauguration Day or having
a national "Talk to the President"
show have helped regain the public's
confidence. Americans now believe
that they are in touch with their presi
dent and that this administration is
holding itself accountable to the
people. Carter's honest, open ap
proach to domestic and foreign issues
is encouraging and serves to offer hope
for the next four years.
In all his endeavors Carter has
shown himself to be extremely cauti
ous and carefully calculating. Carter is
an excellent student of history — he

has high goals but is wary of irrational,
overanxious and sometimes "unpolit
ical" steps which might cause his
goals to disappear. Instead. Carter is
becoming a master of moderation and
an expert in efficiency.
If the beginning of these first 100
days leaves any indication for the fu
ture, we can expect a strong, progres
sive yet somewhat reserved "slow but

sure — steady as you go" approach to
upcoming issues. Carter has a strong
desire to leave a good mark for himself
and his nation, and coming from the
soft-spoken peanut farmer from Geor
gia I'm inclined to believe he may suc
ceed. After all America, shucks, why
not the best?

"All this will not be finished
in the first one hundred days.
Nor will it be finished in the first
one thousand days, nor in the
life of this Administration, nor
even perhaps in our lifetime on
this planet. But let us begin."
—John Kennedy, 1961
John Kennedy's first 100 days
launched America into the dynamic
19605. It was a decade of progress and
failure, of dreams and despair. Unfor
tunately, the bright, promising goals of
the New Frontier were prematurely si
lenced by an assassin's bullet then hur

But Vietnam is behind us. The
"heat" of the cold war is behind us and
"to the best of my recollection" Water
gate is behind us. So let us begin. One
hundred days is long enough for a new
beginning, and although President
Jimmy Carter has had less than 80 days
to start his first 100, necessity calls for
an early evaluation.
List of dreams
Immediately after his election, Car
ter expressed the desire to be a "great
president." Later in his inaugural ad
dress he outlined a long list of ideal
goals for the future: providing
employment for those who can work,
attaining equality under the law, pro
tecting human rights at home and a
broad, eliminating nuclear weapons,
strengthening the American family,
building lasting peace and restoring
trust in government and in the Ameri
can Dream.
Indeed, if half of these goals are even
partially fulfilled, Carter will achieve
greatness. However, a great president
must not only outline the issues of the
day; he must confront these issues
with unending energy, devotion and
innovation. A president is backed by
the substance of his policy and the"
style of his approach.
Style is best exemplified by the abil
ity to "set a tone." Perhaps the most
pervasive method of setting a tone in
modern American politics has been to
project a style of change, progress and
the all powerful "New."

We've had Woodrow Wilson's New
Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt's New
Deal, John Kennedy's New Frontier
and now Jimmy Caiter's New Spirit —
"a fresh faith in the old dream." Presi
dential idealism and goal setting are
important for they capture the purpose
and imagination of the American
people.
Moreover, effective policy requires
that this style be coordinated with real
ity. To evaluate Carter's New Spirit, it
is essential to analyze exactly what has
been achieved and set forth by this
young administration.
Economy
Carter repeatedly raised the issues of
unemployment and inflation during
the 1976 campaign. With 10 million
people unemployed and an annual in
flation rate of over five per cent, these
problems remain paramount today.
The Carter administration has prop
osed a carefully designed combination
of fiscal and monetary policies to
ameliorate the situation.
The economic stimulus package is
two fold: first, a quick expansion of
public buying power through tax cuts
and rebates; second, a gradual step-up
in government spending aimed at in
creasing public works, public service
jobs and private sector job growth.
Ninety per cent of the 1977 $15 billion
extra government stimulus will be
provided through tax rebates and in
come tax adjustments, while govern
ment spending programs will be
phased in toward the end of 1977 and
increased through 1978.
To finance the $70 billion deficit for
1977 (a $10 billion full employment
deficit) the administration must take
care not to crowd out private investors
by overborrowing from the commer
cial banking system. Carter must estab
lish better monetary relations with the
Federal Reserve Board to make sure
the money supply keeps pace with the
proposed six per cent real growth rate.
Carter's ability to revitalize the
economy will perhaps be the basis for
his potential success or failure in meet
ing the demands of the country. To this
date Carter has offered a balanced ap

proach and the economy seems to be
on the upswing.
Energy
Another focal point is a credible na
tional energy policy. With growing
U.S. dependence on foreign oil and
depletion of already scarce domestic
oil reserves, the No. 1 energy concern
has been to consolidate government
energy programs and to aim for con
servation and efficiency. Carter has
proposed the adoption of a Cabinet
level Department of Energy which
would combine the Federal Energy
Administration, the Energy Research
and Development Administration and
the Energy Resources Council.
Added to this, by April 20 Carter
will present a comprehensive energy
plan. Carter's plan promises to call for
both development and conservation
while maintaining "price protection
for the consumer." We can expect tax
incentives and subsidies for efficient
energy use including a sliding-scale
tax that will benefit producers and
buyers of fuel efficient automobiles
and penalize "gas guzzlers."
If Carter can hold fast to his pledge to
protect the environment while de
creasing U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources, his accomplishment
will be impressive. The price, how
ever. will have to be paid by current
energy abusers (including more of us
than one might expect) and this may
mean using less while paying more.
Foreign Policy
On his first day of official duty the
president started both domestic and
foreign policy on the right note by par
doning the 13,000 Vietnam draft evad
ers. In addition the past two months
have shown that the U.S. is attempting
to heal its wounds throughout the
world.
As a result there is hope that nor
malization of relations will be sought
with Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea
and Cuba. Steps have been taken to
regain the confidence of our European
allies while maintaining the long
range goal of lowering the level of
NATO and Warsaw Pact arms in
Europe through proposed Mutual Ba

lanced Force Reduction talks in Vie
nna.
The most indicative aspect of the
change in American foreign affairs has
been displayed by the recent flourish
of open, candid remarks by Carter and
United Nations Ambassador Andrew
Young. Carter and Young have unceas
ingly called for improved human
rights conditions attacking the records
of allies and adversaries alike.
This openness and candor has been
extended throughout U.S. foreign pol
icy. For example, two weeks ago in an
almost off-the-cuff manner Carter ex
pressed his belief that a Middle East
settlement and the establishment of a
complete peace would require Israel to
return most of the Arab land occupied
since the 1967 war.
Such direct remarks by an American
president are unprecedented and yet
Carter has been equally unequivocal in
the U.S. position toward Rhodesia, the
situation in Africa and relations with
the Soviet Union.
The only negative point out of all
this candor has been the recent setback
of U.S.-Soviet arms limitations talks,
but Carter says the renewed discus

energy sources, his accomplishment
will be impressive. The price, how
ever. will have to be paid by current
energy abusers (including more of us
than one might expect) and this may
mean using less while paying more.
Foreign Policy
On his first day of official duty the
president started both domestic and
foreign policy on the right note by par
doning the 13,000 Vietnam draft evad
ers. In addition the past two months
have shown that the U.S. is attempting
to heal its wounds throughout the
world.
As a result there is hope that nor
malization of relations will be sought
with Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea
and Cuba. Steps have been taken to
regain the confidence of our European
allies while maintaining the long
range goal of lowering the level of
NATO and Warsaw Pact arms in
Europe through proposed Mutual Ba

lanced Force Reduction talks in Vie
nna.
The most indicative aspect of the
change in American foreign affairs has
been displayed by the recent flourish
of open, candid remarks by Carter and
United Nations Ambassador Andrew
Young. Carter and Young have unceas
ingly called for improved human
rights conditions attacking the records
of allies and adversaries alike.
This openness and candor has been
extended throughout U.S. foreign pol
icy. For example, two weeks ago in an
almost off-the-cuff manner Carter ex
pressed his belief that a Middle East
settlement and the establishment of a
complete peace would require Israel to
return most of the Arab land occupied
since the 1967 war.
Such direct remarks by an American
president are unprecedented and yet
Carter has been equally unequivocal in
the U.S. position toward Rhodesia, the
situation in Africa and relations with
the Soviet Union.
The only negative point out of all
this candor has been the recent setback
of U.S.-Soviet arms limitations talks,
but Carter says the renewed discus
sions in May will bring progress.
Moral leadership
The prevailing theme of these open
ing months of the Carter administra
tion has been morality and trust in
government. Carter has made a
genuine effort to renew the public's
faith in its leaders.
The president's symbolic gestures
such as walking down Pennsylvania
Avenue on Inauguration Day or having
a national "Talk to the President"
show have helped regain the public's
confidence. Americans now believe
that they are in touch with their presi
dent and that this administration is
holding itself accountable to the
people. Carter's honest, open ap
proach to domestic and foreign issues
is encouraging and serves to offer hope
for the next four years.
In all his endeavors Carter has
shown himself to be extremely cauti
ous and carefully calculating. Carter is
an excellent student of history — he

has high goals but is wary of irrational,
overanxious and sometimes "unpolit
ical" steps which might cause his
goals to disappear. Instead. Carter is
becoming a master of moderation and
an expert in efficiency.
If the beginning of these first 100
days leaves any indication for the fu
ture, we can expect a strong, progres
sive yet somewhat reserved "slow but

sure — steady as you go" approach to
upcoming issues. Carter has a strong
desire to leave a good mark for himself
and his nation, and coming from the
soft-spoken peanut farmer from Geor

"All this will not be finished
in the first one hundred days.
Nor will it be finished in the first
one thousand days, nor in the
life of this Administration, nor
even perhaps in our lifetime on
this planet. But let us begin."
—John Kennedy, 1961
John Kennedy's first 100 days
launched America into the dynamic
19605. It was a decade of progress and
failure, of dreams and despair. Unfor
tunately, the bright, promising goals of
the New Frontier were prematurely si
lenced by an assassin's bullet then hur
ried under the tragic legacy of the Vie
tnam War.
But Vietnam is behind us. The
"heat" of the cold war is behind us and
"to the best of my recollection" Water
gate is behind us. So let us begin. One
hundred days is long enough for a new
beginning, and although President
Jimmy Carter has had less than 80 days
to start his first 100, necessity calls for
an early evaluation.
List of dreams
Immediately after his election, Car
ter expressed the desire to be a "great
president." Later in his inaugural ad
dress he outlined a long list of ideal
goals for the future: providing
employment for those who can work,
attaining equality under the law, pro
tecting human rights at home and a
broad, eliminating nuclear weapons,
strengthening the American family,
building lasting peace and restoring
trust in government and in the Ameri
can Dream.
Indeed, if half of these goals are even
partially fulfilled, Carter will achieve
greatness. However, a great president
must not only outline the issues of the
day; he must confront these issues
with unending energy, devotion and
innovation. A president is backed by
the substance of his policy and the"
style of his approach.
Style is best exemplified by the abil
ity to "set a tone." Perhaps the most
pervasive method of setting a tone in
modern American politics has been to
project a style of change, progress and
the all powerful "New."

We've had Woodrow Wilson's New
Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt's New
Deal, John Kennedy's New Frontier
and now Jimmy Caiter's New Spirit —
"a fresh faith in the old dream." Presi
dential idealism and goal setting are
important for they capture the purpose
and imagination of the American
people.
Moreover, effective policy requires
that this style be coordinated with real
ity. To evaluate Carter's New Spirit, it
is essential to analyze exactly what has
been achieved and set forth by this
young administration.
Economy
Carter repeatedly raised the issues of
unemployment and inflation during
the 1976 campaign. With 10 million
people unemployed and an annual in
flation rate of over five per cent, these
problems remain paramount today.
The Carter administration has prop
osed a carefully designed combination
of fiscal and monetary policies to
ameliorate the situation.
The economic stimulus package is
two fold: first, a quick expansion of
public buying power through tax cuts
and rebates; second, a gradual step-up
in government spending aimed at in
creasing public works, public service
jobs and private sector job growth.
Ninety per cent of the 1977 $15 billion
extra government stimulus will be
provided through tax rebates and in
come tax adjustments, while govern
ment spending programs will be
phased in toward the end of 1977 and
increased through 1978.
To finance the $70 billion deficit for
1977 (a $10 billion full employment
deficit) the administration must take
care not to crowd out private investors
by overborrowing from the commer
cial banking system. Carter must estab
lish better monetary relations with the
Federal Reserve Board to make sure
the money supply keeps pace with the
proposed six per cent real growth rate.
Carter's ability to revitalize the
economy will perhaps be the basis for
his potential success or failure in meet
ing the demands of the country. To this
date Carter has offered a balanced ap

proach and the economy seems to be
on the upswing.
Energy
Another focal point is a credible na
tional energy policy. With growing
U.S. dependence on foreign oil and
depletion of already scarce domestic
oil reserves, the No. 1 energy concern
has been to consolidate government
energy programs and to aim for con
servation and efficiency. Carter has
proposed the adoption of a Cabinet
level Department of Energy which
would combine the Federal Energy
Administration, the Energy Research
and Development Administration and
the Energy Resources Council.
Added to this, by April 20 Carter
will present a comprehensive energy
plan. Carter's plan promises to call for
both development and conservation
while maintaining "price protection
for the consumer." We can expect tax
incentives and subsidies for efficient
energy use including a sliding-scale
tax that will benefit producers and
buyers of fuel efficient automobiles
and penalize "gas guzzlers."
If Carter can hold fast to his pledge to
protect the environment while de
creasing U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources, his accomplishment
will be impressive. The price, how

people unemployed and an annual in
flation rate of over five per cent, these
problems remain paramount today.
The Carter administration has prop
osed a carefully designed combination
of fiscal and monetary policies to
ameliorate the situation.
The economic stimulus package is
two fold: first, a quick expansion of
public buying power through tax cuts
and rebates; second, a gradual step-up
in government spending aimed at in
creasing public works, public service
jobs and private sector job growth.
Ninety per cent of the 1977 $15 billion
extra government stimulus will be
provided through tax rebates and in
come tax adjustments, while govern
ment spending programs will be
phased in toward the end of 1977 and
increased through 1978.
To finance the $70 billion deficit for
1977 (a $10 billion full employment
deficit) the administration must take
care not to crowd out private investors
by overborrowing from the commer
cial banking system. Carter must estab
lish better monetary relations with the
Federal Reserve Board to make sure
the money supply keeps pace with the
proposed six per cent real growth rate.
Carter's ability to revitalize the
economy will perhaps be the basis for
his potential success or failure in meet
ing the demands of the country. To this
date Carter has offered a balanced ap

proach and the economy seems to be
on the upswing.
Energy
Another focal point is a credible na
tional energy policy. With growing
U.S. dependence on foreign oil and
depletion of already scarce domestic
oil reserves, the No. 1 energy concern
has been to consolidate government
energy programs and to aim for con
servation and efficiency. Carter has
proposed the adoption of a Cabinet
level Department of Energy which
would combine the Federal Energy
Administration, the Energy Research
and Development Administration and
the Energy Resources Council.
Added to this, by April 20 Carter
will present a comprehensive energy
plan. Carter's plan promises to call for
both development and conservation
while maintaining "price protection
for the consumer." We can expect tax
incentives and subsidies for efficient
energy use including a sliding-scale
tax that will benefit producers and
buyers of fuel efficient automobiles
and penalize "gas guzzlers."
If Carter can hold fast to his pledge to
protect the environment while de
creasing U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources, his accomplishment
will be impressive. The price, how
ever. will have to be paid by current
energy abusers (including more of us
than one might expect) and this may
mean using less while paying more.
Foreign Policy
On his first day of official duty the
president started both domestic and
foreign policy on the right note by par
doning the 13,000 Vietnam draft evad
ers. In addition the past two months
have shown that the U.S. is attempting
to heal its wounds throughout the
world.
As a result there is hope that nor
malization of relations will be sought
with Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea
and Cuba. Steps have been taken to
regain the confidence of our European
allies while maintaining the long
range goal of lowering the level of
NATO and Warsaw Pact arms in
Europe through proposed Mutual Ba

lanced Force Reduction talks in Vie
nna.
The most indicative aspect of the
change in American foreign affairs has
been displayed by the recent flourish
of open, candid remarks by Carter and
United Nations Ambassador Andrew
Young. Carter and Young have unceas
ingly called for improved human
rights conditions attacking the records
of allies and adversaries alike.
This openness and candor has been
extended throughout U.S. foreign pol
icy. For example, two weeks ago in an
almost off-the-cuff manner Carter ex
pressed his belief that a Middle East
settlement and the establishment of a
complete peace would require Israel to
return most of the Arab land occupied
since the 1967 war.
Such direct remarks by an American
president are unprecedented and yet
Carter has been equally unequivocal in
the U.S. position toward Rhodesia, the
situation in Africa and relations with
the Soviet Union.
The only negative point out of all
this candor has been the recent setback
of U.S.-Soviet arms limitations talks,
but Carter says the renewed discus
sions in May will bring progress.
Moral leadership
The prevailing theme of these open
ing months of the Carter administra
tion has been morality and trust in
government. Carter has made a
genuine effort to renew the public's
faith in its leaders.
The president's symbolic gestures
such as walking down Pennsylvania
Avenue on Inauguration Day or having
a national "Talk to the President"
show have helped regain the public's
confidence. Americans now believe
that they are in touch with their presi
dent and that this administration is
holding itself accountable to the
people. Carter's honest, open ap
proach to domestic and foreign issues
is encouraging and serves to offer hope
for the next four years.
In all his endeavors Carter has
shown himself to be extremely cauti
ous and carefully calculating. Carter is
an excellent student of history — he

has high goals but is wary of irrational,
overanxious and sometimes "unpolit
ical" steps which might cause his
goals to disappear. Instead. Carter is
becoming a master of moderation and
an expert in efficiency.
If the beginning of these first 100
days leaves any indication for the fu
ture, we can expect a strong, progres
sive yet somewhat reserved "slow but

sure — steady as you go" approach to
upcoming issues. Carter has a strong
desire to leave a good mark for himself
and his nation, and coming from the
soft-spoken peanut farmer from Geor
gia I'm inclined to believe he may suc
ceed. After all America, shucks, why
not the best?

"All this will not be finished
in the first one hundred days.
Nor will it be finished in the first
one thousand days, nor in the
life of this Administration, nor
even perhaps in our lifetime on
this planet. But let us begin."
—John Kennedy, 1961
John Kennedy's first 100 days
launched America into the dynamic
19605. It was a decade of progress and
failure, of dreams and despair. Unfor
tunately, the bright, promising goals of
the New Frontier were prematurely si
lenced by an assassin's bullet then hur
ried under the tragic legacy of the Vie
tnam War.
But Vietnam is behind us. The
"heat" of the cold war is behind us and
"to the best of my recollection" Water
gate is behind us. So let us begin. One
hundred days is long enough for a new
beginning, and although President
Jimmy Carter has had less than 80 days
to start his first 100, necessity calls for
an early evaluation.
List of dreams
Immediately after his election, Car
ter expressed the desire to be a "great
president." Later in his inaugural ad
dress he outlined a long list of ideal
goals for the future: providing
employment for those who can work,
attaining equality under the law, pro
tecting human rights at home and a
broad, eliminating nuclear weapons,
strengthening the American family,
building lasting peace and restoring
trust in government and in the Ameri
can Dream.
Indeed, if half of these goals are even
partially fulfilled, Carter will achieve
greatness. However, a great president
must not only outline the issues of the
day; he must confront these issues
with unending energy, devotion and
innovation. A president is backed by
the substance of his policy and the"
style of his approach.
Style is best exemplified by the abil
ity to "set a tone." Perhaps the most
pervasive method of setting a tone in
modern American politics has been to
project a style of change, progress and
the all powerful "New."

We've had Woodrow Wilson's New
Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt's New
Deal, John Kennedy's New Frontier
and now Jimmy Caiter's New Spirit —
"a fresh faith in the old dream." Presi
dential idealism and goal setting are
important for they capture the purpose
and imagination of the American
people.
Moreover, effective policy requires
that this style be coordinated with real
ity. To evaluate Carter's New Spirit, it
is essential to analyze exactly what has
been achieved and set forth by this
young administration.
Economy
Carter repeatedly raised the issues of
unemployment and inflation during
the 1976 campaign. With 10 million
people unemployed and an annual in
flation rate of over five per cent, these
problems remain paramount today.
