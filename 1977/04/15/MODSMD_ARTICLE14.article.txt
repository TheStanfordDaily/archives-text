# Visitors to Tahoe may be charged

Sacramento (AP) â€” Visitors to
the Lake Tahoe Basin would be
charged up to $4 per car for ad
mission to the region if a bill in
troduced today in the California
Legislature becomes law.
The proposal by Assembly
man Eugene Gualco (D-
Sacramento), would levy "recre
ation user fees" on area visitors
to raise funds to purchase land in
the basin.
Gualco said there are 22,000
vacant lots in "environmentally
sensitive areas" in the basin
which should be purchased by
the state.
He estimated the value of
these lots at $25 million. He said
his bill would raise about $6
million a year.
"What I'm trying to do by this
is say we have a problem up
there," Gualco said. "If it can be
done in another way, that's fine
with me."
But Gualco said so far there

has been no support from Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr. to requests
for state general fund money to
purchase Tahoe area lands, and
no federal money is yet availa
ble.
"Who better should pay for it
than the people who visit the
area for recreation," he said.
Gualco said details have not
been worked out as to how his
proposed fee would be collected,
and there were no exact amounts
except a ceiling of $4 "per con
veyance."
He said in addition to purchas
ing land to "preserve the en
vironmental balance in the ba
sin," the revenue from the recre
ation fee could also be used for
reforestation and other related
conservation projects.
Gualco's fee bill is AB 1616. A
companion bill, AB 1615, rede
fines responsibilities of the
Tahoe Conservancy, created by
the legislature in 1973.
