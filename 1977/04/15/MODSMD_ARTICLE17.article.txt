# Anatomy of an art show
## It's part detective work, scholarship and business 
### Katherine Draznin 
Futting on an art show at the
Stanford Museum takes a com
bination of detective work, scho
larship, business sense, design
and public relations skills, luck,
a bit of housecleaning, show
manship and of course, know
ledge and appreciation of art.
Each show is put on for diffe
rent reasons, comprises different
ideas and materials and has un
ique problems. The range of
shows is remarkable, consider
ing the museum's limited staff,
budget and space.
"We always try to present
something different or some
thing more than can be seen at
other museums or galleries,"
said Betsy Fryberger, museum
curator of prints and drawings.
Show themes develop from a
combination of what is timely or
of special interest to the com
munity and what materials are
accessible. Staff and art faculty
members think oif ideas, which
are sometimes integrated with
course themes or based on stu
dent research.
Show costs
Costs for a show include cor
respondence about works and
loans, insurance, installation
fees (for such things as frames,
glass or special construction)
and labor.
Additional costs might in
clude posters, post cards,
catalogs, advertising and re
search and design costs for

printed material.
Curators (those in charge of a
show, or a section of the
museum's collection)
familiarize themselves with
local art collections in order to
develop ideas for exhibits. The
curators also cut shipping costs
by picking up works themselves.
Procedures
Once a show or exhibit is
scheduled, works must be lo
cated, loans arranged and infor
mation for wall labels or catalog
texts gathered. Catalogs here are
rare and restricted to shows of
special historical or informa
tional context for the viewer.
Catalogs for most galleries and
museums emphasize reproduc
tions, while the museum puts
out primarily texts or scholarly
papers with limited illustration.
Catalogs with numerous repro
ductions are favored by artists as
a means of preserving their
show, and by galleries as an easy
way to display an artist's work to
a client.
Scholarly emphasis
Collectors might be more wil
ling to lend works for museum
exhibits because of the scholarly
emphasis of shows here and oc
casionally provide objects the
curator did not know existed.
Works donated to the museum
become part of the permanent
collection or are resold; the
funds are used for yearly acquisi
tions.
Museum Registrar Anita Moz

ley emphasized that the staff
must balance time spent on
exhibits and on upkeep of the
permanent collection.
Short-term exhibits take up a
great deal of time and are subject
to deadline pressure for opening
and closing dates. But these
exhibits attract viewers to the
museum, underscoring the need
to rotate the permanent displays.
The registrar's office contains
files of all legal and scholarly
documents for each object in the
permanent collection, as well as
information on loaned works
and temporary exhibits. The
files must be updated for new
information.
The registrar's files are in
valuable for students as well as
scholars working on objects in
the collection. They also act as a
resource for curators in assembl
ing both temporary and perma
nent displays.
Challenge
Installation of a show, once
everything is assembled, is often
challenging. Design of the dis
play is crucial to audience re
sponse. Mixed or single media,
many on single themes, group or
solo shows, retrospectives,
works of all sizes and visual im
pact present various problems in
the attempt to present a coherent
whole.
Chronological, same artist,
same media or same theme are
typical "hanging" orders. The
museum has relatively few prob

lems since few three
dimensional objects are dis
played and the more-frequent
print, drawing or photo shows
can be previsualized and easily
shifted as the works are hung.
Reception of a show is unpre
dictable, especially since the
University is generally isolated
from San Francisco reviewers.
The museum does not base show
ideas on critical reception, but
staff members noted increased
attendance whenever reviews
appeared in San Francisco pap
ers.
Artists who show at galleries
or museums are more concerned
with critical notice, although
more often with other artists'
opinions, according to painter
and instructor Keith Boyle. He
said he felt museum shows are
both more prestigious for the ar
tist and virtual insurance of
some major critical review.
Little notice
The University lends objects
and whole shows and also bor
rows shows. The recent Ead
weard Muybridge show received
little critical notice although it
was the first time such a large
collection of his photos had been
assembled. A visiting New York
museum director saw the show,
requested a loan, and since then,
the show has traveled to 22 U.S.
museums. It is now traveling in
Europe. The University's catalog
for the landmark show was
translated into German for the

European tour.
"Loans are usually arranged
before the initial show so that
lenders of work know exactly
how long the work will be out,"
commented Mozley, who is also
curator of photography.
Because museums are non

profit organizations, volunteer
workers are often crucial to a
museum's program. There are
about 50 docents, or volunteers,
at the museum.
Docents must audit art history
courses, be generally know
ledgeable in history and keep up

with information on both
exhibits and objects in the col
lection in order to conduct tours.
Docent tours have become in
creasingly popular because they
give dimension to a visit to the
collection, according to
Fryberger.

the attempt to present a coherent
whole.
Chronological, same artist,
same media or same theme are
typical "hanging" orders. The
museum has relatively few prob

lems since few three
dimensional objects are dis
played and the more-frequent
print, drawing or photo shows
can be previsualized and easily
shifted as the works are hung.
Reception of a show is unpre
dictable, especially since the
University is generally isolated
from San Francisco reviewers.
The museum does not base show
ideas on critical reception, but
staff members noted increased
attendance whenever reviews
appeared in San Francisco pap
ers.
Artists who show at galleries
or museums are more concerned
with critical notice, although
more often with other artists'
opinions, according to painter
and instructor Keith Boyle. He
said he felt museum shows are
both more prestigious for the ar
tist and virtual insurance of
some major critical review.
Little notice
The University lends objects
and whole shows and also bor
rows shows. The recent Ead
weard Muybridge show received
little critical notice although it
was the first time such a large
collection of his photos had been
assembled. A visiting New York
museum director saw the show,
requested a loan, and since then,
the show has traveled to 22 U.S.
museums. It is now traveling in
Europe. The University's catalog
for the landmark show was
translated into German for the

European tour.
"Loans are usually arranged
before the initial show so that
lenders of work know exactly
how long the work will be out,"
commented Mozley, who is also
curator of photography.
Because museums are non

profit organizations, volunteer
workers are often crucial to a
museum's program. There are
about 50 docents, or volunteers,
at the museum.
Docents must audit art history
courses, be generally know
ledgeable in history and keep up

with information on both
exhibits and objects in the col
lection in order to conduct tours.
Docent tours have become in
creasingly popular because they
give dimension to a visit to the
collection, according to
Fryberger.
Futting on an art show at the
Stanford Museum takes a com
bination of detective work, scho
larship, business sense, design
and public relations skills, luck,
a bit of housecleaning, show
manship and of course, know
ledge and appreciation of art.
Each show is put on for diffe
rent reasons, comprises different
ideas and materials and has un
ique problems. The range of
shows is remarkable, consider
ing the museum's limited staff,
budget and space.
"We always try to present
something different or some
thing more than can be seen at
other museums or galleries,"
said Betsy Fryberger, museum
curator of prints and drawings.
Show themes develop from a
combination of what is timely or
of special interest to the com
munity and what materials are
accessible. Staff and art faculty
members think oif ideas, which
are sometimes integrated with
course themes or based on stu
dent research.
Show costs
Costs for a show include cor
respondence about works and
loans, insurance, installation
fees (for such things as frames,
glass or special construction)
and labor.
Additional costs might in
clude posters, post cards,
catalogs, advertising and re
search and design costs for

printed material.
Curators (those in charge of a
show, or a section of the
museum's collection)
familiarize themselves with
local art collections in order to
develop ideas for exhibits. The
curators also cut shipping costs
by picking up works themselves.
Procedures
Once a show or exhibit is
scheduled, works must be lo
cated, loans arranged and infor
mation for wall labels or catalog
texts gathered. Catalogs here are
rare and restricted to shows of
special historical or informa
tional context for the viewer.
Catalogs for most galleries and
museums emphasize reproduc
tions, while the museum puts
out primarily texts or scholarly
papers with limited illustration.
Catalogs with numerous repro
ductions are favored by artists as
a means of preserving their
show, and by galleries as an easy
way to display an artist's work to
a client.
Scholarly emphasis
Collectors might be more wil
ling to lend works for museum
exhibits because of the scholarly
emphasis of shows here and oc
casionally provide objects the
curator did not know existed.
Works donated to the museum
become part of the permanent
collection or are resold; the
funds are used for yearly acquisi
tions.
Museum Registrar Anita Moz

ley emphasized that the staff
must balance time spent on
exhibits and on upkeep of the
permanent collection.
Short-term exhibits take up a
great deal of time and are subject
to deadline pressure for opening
and closing dates. But these
exhibits attract viewers to the
museum, underscoring the need
to rotate the permanent displays.
The registrar's office contains
files of all legal and scholarly
documents for each object in the
permanent collection, as well as
information on loaned works
and temporary exhibits. The
files must be updated for new
information.
The registrar's files are in
valuable for students as well as
scholars working on objects in
the collection. They also act as a
resource for curators in assembl
ing both temporary and perma
nent displays.
Challenge
Installation of a show, once
everything is assembled, is often
challenging. Design of the dis
play is crucial to audience re
sponse. Mixed or single media,
many on single themes, group or
solo shows, retrospectives,
works of all sizes and visual im
pact present various problems in
the attempt to present a coherent
whole.

same media or same theme are

curators also cut shipping costs
by picking up works themselves.
Procedures
Once a show or exhibit is
scheduled, works must be lo
cated, loans arranged and infor
mation for wall labels or catalog
texts gathered. Catalogs here are
rare and restricted to shows of
special historical or informa
tional context for the viewer.
Catalogs for most galleries and
museums emphasize reproduc
tions, while the museum puts
out primarily texts or scholarly
papers with limited illustration.
Catalogs with numerous repro
ductions are favored by artists as
a means of preserving their
show, and by galleries as an easy
way to display an artist's work to
a client.
Scholarly emphasis
Collectors might be more wil
ling to lend works for museum
exhibits because of the scholarly
emphasis of shows here and oc
casionally provide objects the
curator did not know existed.
Works donated to the museum
become part of the permanent
collection or are resold; the
funds are used for yearly acquisi
tions.
Museum Registrar Anita Moz

ley emphasized that the staff
must balance time spent on
exhibits and on upkeep of the
permanent collection.
Short-term exhibits take up a
great deal of time and are subject
to deadline pressure for opening
and closing dates. But these
exhibits attract viewers to the
museum, underscoring the need
to rotate the permanent displays.
The registrar's office contains
files of all legal and scholarly
documents for each object in the
permanent collection, as well as
information on loaned works
and temporary exhibits. The
files must be updated for new
information.
The registrar's files are in
valuable for students as well as
scholars working on objects in
the collection. They also act as a
resource for curators in assembl
ing both temporary and perma
nent displays.
Challenge
Installation of a show, once
everything is assembled, is often
challenging. Design of the dis
play is crucial to audience re
sponse. Mixed or single media,
many on single themes, group or
solo shows, retrospectives,
works of all sizes and visual im
pact present various problems in
the attempt to present a coherent
whole.
Chronological, same artist,
same media or same theme are
typical "hanging" orders. The
museum has relatively few prob

lems since few three
dimensional objects are dis
played and the more-frequent
print, drawing or photo shows
can be previsualized and easily
shifted as the works are hung.
Reception of a show is unpre
dictable, especially since the
University is generally isolated
from San Francisco reviewers.
The museum does not base show
ideas on critical reception, but
staff members noted increased
attendance whenever reviews
appeared in San Francisco pap
ers.
Artists who show at galleries
or museums are more concerned
with critical notice, although
more often with other artists'
opinions, according to painter
and instructor Keith Boyle. He
said he felt museum shows are
both more prestigious for the ar
tist and virtual insurance of
some major critical review.
Little notice
The University lends objects
and whole shows and also bor
rows shows. The recent Ead
weard Muybridge show received
little critical notice although it
was the first time such a large
collection of his photos had been
assembled. A visiting New York
museum director saw the show,
requested a loan, and since then,
the show has traveled to 22 U.S.
museums. It is now traveling in
Europe. The University's catalog
for the landmark show was
translated into German for the

European tour.
"Loans are usually arranged
before the initial show so that
lenders of work know exactly
how long the work will be out,"
commented Mozley, who is also
curator of photography.
Because museums are non

profit organizations, volunteer
workers are often crucial to a
museum's program. There are
about 50 docents, or volunteers,
at the museum.
Docents must audit art history
courses, be generally know
ledgeable in history and keep up

with information on both
exhibits and objects in the col
lection in order to conduct tours.
Docent tours have become in
creasingly popular because they
give dimension to a visit to the
collection, according to
Fryberger.
Futting on an art show at the
Stanford Museum takes a com
bination of detective work, scho
larship, business sense, design
and public relations skills, luck,
a bit of housecleaning, show
manship and of course, know
ledge and appreciation of art.
Each show is put on for diffe
rent reasons, comprises different
ideas and materials and has un
ique problems. The range of
shows is remarkable, consider
ing the museum's limited staff,
budget and space.
"We always try to present
something different or some
thing more than can be seen at
other museums or galleries,"
said Betsy Fryberger, museum
curator of prints and drawings.
Show themes develop from a
combination of what is timely or
of special interest to the com
munity and what materials are
accessible. Staff and art faculty
members think oif ideas, which
are sometimes integrated with
course themes or based on stu
dent research.
Show costs
Costs for a show include cor
respondence about works and
loans, insurance, installation
fees (for such things as frames,
glass or special construction)
and labor.
Additional costs might in
clude posters, post cards,
catalogs, advertising and re
search and design costs for

printed material.
Curators (those in charge of a
show, or a section of the
museum's collection)
familiarize themselves with
local art collections in order to
develop ideas for exhibits. The
curators also cut shipping costs
by picking up works themselves.
