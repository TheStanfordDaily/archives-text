Last Monday (April 4) at about 5 p.m., I was
running by the pool near Maples. The pool was
covered with what looked like about 100
styrofoam pads. Why?
-A Friend
Well, 1 called Jeff Hammett, who manages the
pool, and had a nice chat with him. The sytrofoam
pads you have seen are in reality insulated pool
covers. They have been on the pool daily since
January in an effort to conserve energy.
Each section is 8 feet by 2 feet x 1 foot, and they
have been "tremendously effective" according to
Hammett. Not only do they reduce heat loss, but
they also reduce evaporation and so conserve wa
ter.
The plan will be to use the covers from October
until mid-April. When in use, they are "uncovered
only during pool use time." For instance, the swim
team would take them off in the morning and the
lifeguards would replace them in late afternoon.
There have been some problems however. Ac
cording to Hammett, the covers are expensive, and
whether on or off, night swimming does continue.
This results in two problems : (1) people break
them; or (2) fail to replace them.

Thus, tighter security measures have been
adopted. Hammett sees this as an "unfortunate
thing," because he doesn't begrudge the night visi
tations. But due to the tremendous financial out
lay, stricter measures had to be employed.
So just remember the next time you can't in
dulge in a night time skinny dip, you're helping to
conserve energy!

How much did the Low School Film Society
gross (literally and figuratively) on "Pink Flamin
goes"?
How much did they pay to get the rights to show
it?
-Cotton and Crackers
As for the literal aspect, Carl Siegel of the Law
School Film Society tells me that the gross profit
was $700. Of that, only $100 was net profit. Siegel
also informed me that the entire $100 went to a
scholarship fund. The Law School Film Society is
completely non-profit, and workers such as Siegel
draw no pay.
As for the figurative aspect, a random poll of
Daily staffers shows that the gross (out) was exj
ceedingly high.
