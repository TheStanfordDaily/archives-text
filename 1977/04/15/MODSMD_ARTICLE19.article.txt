# Financial aid forms to be consolidated
## 
### Doug Hyde 
The state Student Aid Commission has approved a proposal that
the myriad financial aid application forms and procedures now
existing be consolidated into a one-step process.
However, the University will not use the common application
approved by the commission, according to Mary Roberts, assistant
director of financial aids.
Under the provisions of the proposal, starting next fall, students
will apply to one central agency for federal grants, state scholarships
and state college aid.
Currently, more than 100,000 first-year college students must
apply to various state and federal agencies and state college cam
puses to receive more than $140 million from eight separate aid
programs.
The proposal, made by the Carter administration, the commission
and California colleges, encourages the use of common financial aid
applications for aid programs at private universities.
Roberts said, however, that the common form approved by the
commission did not include information the University considers
important in determining amounts of financial aid to award applic
ants.
The state legislature is also looking into the possibility of reform
ing the student loan program on a statewide level.
A bill introduced roughly four weeks ago would, if approved, shift
the administration of the federally-insured student loan program
from Washington, D.C. to Sacramento.
The bill is designed to decrease administrative costs for the
banks involved in the student loan program and to minimize the
losses that could occur to banks which cover defaulted loans.
Proponents of the bill say they hope the bill will curb the cutbacks
by participating banks in their specific student loan programs.
Bruce Fuller, consultant for the Assembly Education Subcommit
tee on Postsecondary Education, noted that California banks have
cut back their loan programs by more than $40 million over the last
few years.
Fuller pointed out that in states with programs similar to the one
proposed, bank loans have increased by $70 million.
The bill is scheduled to come before the state legislature in early
May.
