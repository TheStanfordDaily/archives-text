# Expert predicts energy source excess
## 
### Lindsey How 
John Henry, director of the
Energy Center at the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), is pre
dicting there will be an excess of
energy sources by the turn of the
century. In a speech last month
before the Comstock Club in Sac
ramento, he said, "There are suf
ficient quantities of fossil fuels
to last well until the next cen
tury, leaving time for sound
energy planning.
"Higher energy costs have
brought about greater efficiency
of energy use, and we continue
to revise our future consumption
estimates downward," he ad
ded.
Efficient energy use will in
crease due to technological in
novations brought about by in
creases in price, Henry said.
The growth rate of the world
population is expected to
stabilize, slowing energy con
sumption use, he added.
Oil and gas will remain pre
dominant fuel sources, but nuc
lear power use will increase and
other energy systems will be de
veloped to supplement depleta
ble resources, Henry continued.
The world's recoverable oil re
serves have been growing at a
rate of 3.5 per cent annually, he

said, while recoverable gas re
serves have grown more rapidly.
Excess oil and gas reserves
will occur because of higher
prices, which make it economi
cal to drill in less accessible
places, Henry remarked.
High prices not only increase
supplies, but lessen demand as
well.
Due to reduced demand, SRI
estimates of U.S. energy con
sumption by the year 2000 are
the equivalent of three million
barrels a day less than estimates
made two years ago, and 20 mill
ion barrels a day less than esti
mates made before the 1973 Arab
oil embargo.
However, Henry said this op

timistic view of energy con
sumption assumes energy re
sources will be traded at com
petitive market prices, without
price controls that hold fuel
prices at a fraction of their true
market value.
His predictions also assume
that natural governments will
encourage development of
domestic energy supplies and
that incentives such as tax cre
dits will be allowed companies
that develop their country's re
sources.
Other assumptions Henry
made included the achieving of
environmental goals and no
open warfare occurring to affect
trade.
