# Plan to enlarge park draws protest

San Francisco (AP) —
Lumbermen working in the
timber industry along Califor
nia's lush north coast will not be
hurt by plans to more than dou
ble the size of Redwood National
Park, Rep. Phillip Burton in
sisted yesterday.
The San Francisco Democrat,
author of legislation to increase
the 58,000-acre park by 74,000
acres to protect some of the
world's tallest trees, said, "We
are determined that the people
working in the timber industry
will not suffer."
He spoke at the third hearing
on the plan by a Department of
the Interior subcommittee which
he chairs.
Don Clausen, the Republican
congressman who represents the
area, said he is completely op
posed to any park expansion,
calling it "unwise, unnecessary

and unaifordable.
Clausen said expansion would
have a devastating $1.7 billion
cos t__including $600 million for
land and the rest in lost wages.
"I'm not here to protect the
companies—they're going to be
paid off. My job is to protect
jobs," Clausen said to cheers
from about half of the 300 per
sons at the hearing.
The first hearing was last
month in Washington and the
second Wednesday in Eureka,
where Burton said speakers were
about 10-1 in opposition to ex
panding the park.
Following the emotional hear
ing in Eureka, a caravan of trucks
and buses traveled the 300 miles
south to San Francisco for yes
terday's hearing.
Hundreds of angry loggers
paraded in front of the Federal
Building, carrying anti

environmentalist signs and
chanting their opposition to the
expansion plans.
John Henning, executive sec
retary ot the 1.7 million member
California Federation of Labor,
praised Burton for his work with
labor and the poor, then attacked
liberals and conservationists
who favor park expansion.
"We resent the patronizing
tones of those who tell working
people to look to the federal gov
ernment for charity and work
programs," he said as the audi
ence cheered.
William Mckillop, a Univer
sity of California forest
economist, estimated the move
would wipe out 2200 jobs. His
study was attacked by a Berkeley
colleague, economist Richard
Norgard, who said he believed
the impact would be less. Nor
gard noted that the McKillop re

port failed to consider new jobs
created by increased tourism
and park maintenance.
The focus of the controversy is
the Tall Trees Grove on Bed
wood Creek at the south end of
the park, an area bordered on
three sides by lumber company
land. Conservationists claim the
trees, including the tallest trees
in the world, are endangered by
continued logging.
Lumber spokesmen insist that
newly-instituted logging con
trols provide adequate protec
tion to the park.
