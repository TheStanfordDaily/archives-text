# Aerosols banned despite job loss
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) —A
watered-down ban on aerosol
propellants linked to cancer won
senate approval yesterday de
spite claims that it would sac
rifice jobs for limited environ
mental gain.
The bill would ban the man
ufacture and sale in California of
most fluorocarbon aerosol prop
ellants, which are commonly
used in deoderants and hair

sprays.
There have been scientific
studies linking fluorocarbons to
depletion of the earth's ozone
layer, which provides protection
from skin cancer-causing ul
traviolet rays.
The bill would still allow use
of fluorocarbons in refrigerators
and for medical or dental pur
poses.
Industry officials have said
they expect federal agencies to
ban the "sale and use of non
essential aerosols" which would
allow companies to seek exemp
tions for their products.
It would also allow overseas
sales of the aerosols, although a
spokesman has denied that the
industry would pursue sales of
products banned in the United
States.
Bill supporters said that the tie
between fluorocarbons and skin
cancer had been proven and that
the best way to get a federal ban
was for California to enact one of
its own.
"We are dealing here with the
health and safety of this coun
try," said Sen. John Dunlap
(D —Napa), author of the bill.
"This is not just aesthetics."
But Sen. Dennis Carpenter
(R —Newport Beach) said that
even though he believes

fluorocarbons help deplete
ozone, he did not think the state
should act before the federal
government.
"Why should California fall
on its sword to create an im
provement that is basically in
significant as it relates to the
overall problem?" he said.
