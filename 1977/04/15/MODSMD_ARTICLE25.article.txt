# Invaders threaten Zaire copper mines
## 
### Associated Press 
A spokesman for invaders
in southeastern Zaire
claimed yesterday that they
had inflicted a "heavy de
feat" on government forces
only 15 miles from the
copper-mining center of
Kolwezi.
West Germany, mean
while, joined a growing list
of Western nations aiding
Zaire and said it would ship
$2 million worth of
medicine and food.
A spokesman in Paris for
the Congo National Libera
tion Front (FLNC), which
claims to speak for the Zaire
invaders, said rebel forces
battled government and
"mercenary" troops Wed
nesday at Lupafa, 15 miles
west of Kolwezi.
The spokesman said gov
ernment forces abandoned
"a burned-out armored veh
icle, a truck, a jeep, four
heavy machine guns and
four radio transmitters."
Kolwezi has become the
operational base for Moroc
can troops flown in by
French and Moroccan
transports over the weekend
to buttress President
Mobutu Sese Seko's forces
against the rebels.

There was no immediate
comment from Kinshasa,
the Zaire capital, on the
FLNC claims. Diplomatic
sources there say the invad
ers have made no move for
about two weeks and are
stopped 50 miles east of
Kolwezi.
The exile Katangan seces
sionists, estimated at 2000
men, invaded Shaba Pro
vince, formerly known as
Katanga Province, from An
gola early last month and
have occupied about a third
of the economically vital
territory.
The Moroccan troops,
about 150U men, have been
working since their arrival
to set up supply lines and
learn the terrain, apparently
in preparation for an offen
sive against the invaders.
The Zaire government
banned any further trips by
newsmen to Shaba and said
any correspondents there
would be flown back.
In Bonn, German gov
ernment spokesman Klaus
Boelling said the cabinet
decided to send $2 million
worth of food and medical
assistance to Zaireans af
fected by the hostilities in
Shaba.

Boelling said West Ger
many will stick to its policy
ot nonintervention in Africa
and preserving the territo
rial integrity of African
states.
He added that Bonn be
lieves it was this "very same
motive" that prompted
French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing to au
thorize the French airlift of
Moroccan troops and
supplies into Zaire.
The statement was vie
wed as a cautiously-worded
expression of support for
the controversial French ac
tion, which was taken with
out consulting the United
States or France's West
European allies.
Reports from Kinshasa
said the French air force is
flying about 20 planeloads
of supplies into Shaba daily.
About 60 French military
men have been in Zaire
since 1974 training local
troops in the use of French
military equipment, an
another 20 men have arrived
to handle technical details
of the airlift.
Assistance
The United States has
sent several million dollars'
worth of "nonlethal" assis

tance to Mobutu. Belgium,
theformer colonial power in
Zaire, has sent two
planeloads of light weapons
which the government says
were ordered before the in
vasion, as well as food and
medicine.
In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
thousands of Ethiopians,
some carrying swords,
spears, sticks and stones,
rallied in Revolution Square
to demonstrate their readi
ness to repel a reported
Sudanese invasion.
The mass rally followed an
appeal to the Ethiopian
people Tuesday night by
head of state Lt. Col. Men
gistu Haile Mariam to pre
pare for the defense of their
"motherland from an invad
ing army of neighboring
Sudan."
Mengistu accused
Sudanese President Jaafaj
Numeiri of supporting with
tanks and heavy artillery
two groups fighting against
the Addis Ababa govern
ment. Although Sudan has
admitted support for Erit
rean rebels in northern
Ethiopia, it has denied hav
ing any troops inside
Ethiopia.
