For rock fans in the Bay Area,
warmer weather brings the huge
outdoor rock concerts in the Oak
land Coliseum. In just one day,
some 60,000 persons cram into the
stadium and create a giant party.
They overwhelm each other. Many
times, the people become just as
interesting as the musicians on
stage. These pictures, which were
taken at the Who/Grateful Dead
concert, capture some of the more
unusual people you might meet at
one of these events.
