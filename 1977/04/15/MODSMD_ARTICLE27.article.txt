## Netters thump No. 1 Bruins 
### Richard Keller 
It was all over by 7:30 last night.
Before a Maples Pavilion crowd of 3251,
the Stanford men's tennis team shook off an
earlier defeat to trounce UCLA, 6-3. The
Card's victory halted top-ranked Bruins'
dual match win string at 13. It is the first timp
since 1974 that Stanford has come out on
top.
In the early afternoon matches, Perry
Wright of Stanford edged Tony Graham, 6-3,
4-6, 6-4; UCLA's Bruce Nichols beat John
Rast, 7-5, 6-3; UCLA's John Austin sat on
Lloyd Bourne, 6-1, 6-3; and Jim Hodges of
Stanford hatched a goose-egg in the third set
defeating Jon Paley, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0.
Bill Maze and Rast, the No. 2 doubles duo
squeaked by Austin and Nichols, 6-1, 1-6,
7-6 (5-2), while Hodges and Peter Rennert
beat Paley and Graham, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (5-1).
The team score was Stanford 3, UCLA 2,
when Hodges and Rennert took the court
yesterday afternoon. It turned out to be a
crucial match.
"I told them they had to win third doubles
before the match," said Stanford coach Dick
Gould. "The point is you won't win matches
just sitting around. You have to go out after
them. You have to have the confidence to
take the match away. They (Hodges and Re
nnert) didn't put their heads down."
The Stanford tandem played the first set in

fine form but let up in the second and were
behind all the way.
Hodges and Rennert were down 4-5 in the
third with UCLA at serve, but they bore
down and broke the Bruin's serve and then
held to push the count to 6-5. Stanford had
served a pair of match points in the last
game, but UCLA won the 3-3 no-add point to
put the match in a tie-breaker. After that, it
was no contest.
The first match of Maples was between
Maze and UCLA freshman Van Winitsky.
Maze played an incredibly strong serve and
volley game, taking the match and some re
venge, 6-4, 6-3. Only two weeks ago Maze
lost to Winitsky, 6-3, 6-4.
In the opening set Maze had trouble find
ing his serve, but volleyed to perfection.
Maze fell behind 0-2 in the second set before
igniting his rockets. The Stanford junior
reeled off five straight games to make the
score, 5-2.
Winitsky had no answer to Maze's intimi
dation at the net. Whenever the UCLA netter
reached a backhand, he looped it up in the
air too high, thus allowing Maze to put the
ball away at will.
On match point, Winitsky drilled the ball
at Maze's backhand. The Cardinal star dove,
barely reached the shot, then lofted it above
the net with so much backspin it almost

came back to him. Winitsky tried desper
ately to retrieve the drop shot, but couldn't,
and almost hung himself on the net cord as a
result.
Ferdi Taygan squeaked by Stanford's Matt
Mitchell, 7-6 (5-2), 1-6, 7-5. A questionable
linesman's call might have cost Mitch a vic
tory.
The match was marked by both players'
excellent serve and volley games. On nearly
every point Mitchell approached the net and
pushed Taygan well behind the baseline.
The Card sophomore's shots deep to
Taygan's backhand were very effective.
With Mitchell serving at 5-5 games and a
point score of 3-3, in the final set, the lines
man called a serve in that appeared to be out
Outraged, Mitchell stopped the match and
had the call reversed. Taygan responded by
giving Mitchell two serves, but Michell
couldn't come up with a winning shot. He
lost that game and fought to 3-3 in the fol
lowing game before bowing out, 5-7.
According to Gould, "Matt served a great
match. I thought that his serve and volley
game was terrific throughout."
Mitchell didn't see it that way. "I didn't
play particularly well," he said. "1 wasn't
satisfied with my return of serve."
Mitchell and Maze beat Taygan-Winitsky
at the No. 1 doubles, 7-6 (5-2), 6-4.

take the match away. They (Hodges and Re
nnert) didn't put their heads down."
The Stanford tandem played the first set in

fine form but let up in the second and were
behind all the way.
Hodges and Rennert were down 4-5 in the
third with UCLA at serve, but they bore
down and broke the Bruin's serve and then
held to push the count to 6-5. Stanford had
served a pair of match points in the last
game, but UCLA won the 3-3 no-add point to
put the match in a tie-breaker. After that, it
was no contest.
The first match of Maples was between
Maze and UCLA freshman Van Winitsky.
Maze played an incredibly strong serve and
volley game, taking the match and some re
venge, 6-4, 6-3. Only two weeks ago Maze
lost to Winitsky, 6-3, 6-4.
In the opening set Maze had trouble find
ing his serve, but volleyed to perfection.
Maze fell behind 0-2 in the second set before
igniting his rockets. The Stanford junior
reeled off five straight games to make the
score, 5-2.
Winitsky had no answer to Maze's intimi
dation at the net. Whenever the UCLA netter
reached a backhand, he looped it up in the
air too high, thus allowing Maze to put the
ball away at will.
On match point, Winitsky drilled the ball
at Maze's backhand. The Cardinal star dove,
barely reached the shot, then lofted it above
the net with so much backspin it almost

came back to him. Winitsky tried desper
ately to retrieve the drop shot, but couldn't,
and almost hung himself on the net cord as a
result.
Ferdi Taygan squeaked by Stanford's Matt
Mitchell, 7-6 (5-2), 1-6, 7-5. A questionable
linesman's call might have cost Mitch a vic
tory.
The match was marked by both players'
excellent serve and volley games. On nearly
every point Mitchell approached the net and
pushed Taygan well behind the baseline.
The Card sophomore's shots deep to
Taygan's backhand were very effective.
With Mitchell serving at 5-5 games and a
point score of 3-3, in the final set, the lines
man called a serve in that appeared to be out
Outraged, Mitchell stopped the match and
had the call reversed. Taygan responded by
giving Mitchell two serves, but Michell
couldn't come up with a winning shot. He
lost that game and fought to 3-3 in the fol
lowing game before bowing out, 5-7.
According to Gould, "Matt served a great
match. I thought that his serve and volley
game was terrific throughout."
Mitchell didn't see it that way. "I didn't
play particularly well," he said. "1 wasn't
satisfied with my return of serve."

Before a Maples Pavilion crowd of 3251,
the Stanford men's tennis team shook off an
earlier defeat to trounce UCLA, 6-3. The
Card's victory halted top-ranked Bruins'
dual match win string at 13. It is the first timp

The team score was Stanford 3, UCLA 2,
when Hodges and Rennert took the court

crucial match.
"I told them they had to win third doubles
before the match," said Stanford coach Dick
Gould. "The point is you won't win matches
just sitting around. You have to go out after
them. You have to have the confidence to

the net with so much backspin it almost

came back to him. Winitsky tried desper
ately to retrieve the drop shot, but couldn't,
and almost hung himself on the net cord as a
result.
Ferdi Taygan squeaked by Stanford's Matt
Mitchell, 7-6 (5-2), 1-6, 7-5. A questionable
linesman's call might have cost Mitch a vic
tory.
The match was marked by both players'
excellent serve and volley games. On nearly
every point Mitchell approached the net and
pushed Taygan well behind the baseline.
The Card sophomore's shots deep to
Taygan's backhand were very effective.
With Mitchell serving at 5-5 games and a
point score of 3-3, in the final set, the lines
man called a serve in that appeared to be out
Outraged, Mitchell stopped the match and
had the call reversed. Taygan responded by
giving Mitchell two serves, but Michell
couldn't come up with a winning shot. He
lost that game and fought to 3-3 in the fol
lowing game before bowing out, 5-7.
According to Gould, "Matt served a great
match. I thought that his serve and volley
game was terrific throughout."
Mitchell didn't see it that way. "I didn't
play particularly well," he said. "1 wasn't
satisfied with my return of serve."
Mitchell and Maze beat Taygan-Winitsky
at the No. 1 doubles, 7-6 (5-2), 6-4.
