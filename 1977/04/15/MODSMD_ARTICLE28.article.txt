## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Winners of 26 NCAA track and
field titles and the last 40 of its
meetings with Stanford, defend
ing national champion USC
meets the Cardinals tomorrow at
California's Edward Stadium on
the Bears' new Tartan track. Cal
hosts UCLA in the other part of
the Saturday double dual.
Two Trojan alumni would like
nothing better than to see their
alma mater upset by Stanford in
tomorrow's confrontation. Card
coaches Fayton Jordan and Mar
shall Clark, who both used to run
in the SC cardinal and gold,
guide the Cards against the awe
some Trojans.
Four point scorers in last
year's NCAA meet have returned
to Southern Cal this season to
lead a talented group of veterans
and newcomers.
Hurdler Tom Andrews, 800-
meter runner Rayfield Beaton
and discus throwers Ralph
Fruguglietti and Darrell Elder all
scored in the 1976 national meet
and remain the keys to Trojan
hopes to repeat as NCAA
champs.
The Trojans possess an abun
dance of talent in the sprints
with Joel Andrew, Clancy Ed
wards, Rich Graybehl, Kevin
Williams and Mike Simmons
burning the cinders for USC.
Card dashmen Gordon Banks,
Marvin Holmes, James Lofton
and Alan Sheats have their work
cut out for them.

The multi-talented Lofton has
leaped 26-9 this season, the top
long jump mark in the world so
far this year. He normally com
petes in a class by himself. But
Southern Cal's Larry Doubley of
fers Lofton a serious challenge in
his specialty.
Doubley, dubbed "Baby Ali
has gone 26-0 3 /4 this season. The
6-foot-8 Trojan freshman leaps
over cars in stay in shape. He has
a wind-aided jump of 26-8.
Trojan weightmen John
Mckenzie and Fruguglietti.both

with seasonal bests over 60 feet,
challenge Card shot putter Terry
Albritton. Albritton appears to
be recovering well from the
hamstring pull he suffered ear
lier in the season.
Except for Albritton and Lof
ton, the Cards will be outman
ned in nearly every field event.
Stanford must score well in the
distance events — the 1500- and
5000-meter runs and the 3000-
meter steeplechase — to even
stay close to the Trojans.
