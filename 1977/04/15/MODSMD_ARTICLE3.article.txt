# Co-op, frat costs to rise
## 
### Thatcher Freund 
Housing costs for nine co-ops and 11
fraternities here will rise 16 or 18 per
cent next year, according to Richard
Highfield, assistant director of univer
sity housing.
The decision was reached by Ed
ward Scoles, director of housing, and
Norm Robinson, acting associate dean
of student affairs.
The increase was announced at a
Wednesday meeting with house man
agers. Not covered by the rise will be
four hoi-ses. They are the Sigma Chi
and Thefa Xi fraternities and Theta Chi
and Phi Sig co-ops. All four houses
lease only their land from the Univer
sity and own their buildings.
The figures were arrived at "accord
ing to a formula," said Robinson, to
better reflect real costs of housing to

day.
Co-op costs had been about 10 per
cent lower than those of other houses,
said Robinson, and now "utilities in
particular are bearing a larger per
cent" of the total housing costs.
"That's the reason for the magnitudi
nal jump," he said.
'Song and dance'
"There will be no more song and
dance," Robinson said, after the for
mula for the increases had been
explained. He admitted that in past
years no specific break down of hous
ing costs had been made.
The 11 fraternities and seven of the
co-ops will see a 16 per cent mark-up
in their housing costs.
These are the residences which are
charged a lump sum for rent, rather
than having individuals each be billed

on Permits To Register (PTRs). For
frats and group-billed co-ops, indi
viduals will pay $788 next year, up
from $680 this year, according to the
report by Scoles and Robinson.
Housing charges to a resident have
been broken down into four categories
for the self-operated houses. Residen
tial education, which includes costs
for house associates (RAs) and the Row
Housing Office, will be $108 next year.
Utilities will run $166 and a kitchen
and dining room use fee with be $99.
All other costs, a category which in
cludes costs for repair, debt services
and costs for the Residential Manage
ment Office, will be $431.
The Dekes
Randy Barnes, house manager for
the Delta Kappa Epsilon house (De
kes), said the Dekes "don't want any
part of Residential Education" and
that he doesn't "think any other frater
nities do either." Barnes said "Stan
ford wants to assimilate the fraternities
into the housing system."
Robinson said the "fraternities are a
very real part of the housing system —
an integral part."
He added that the purpose of the
guaranteed housing system was to
"get rid of the inequities" between
fraternities and co-ops. The frater
nities only differ from the co-ops in
method of selection.
Only two houses will definitely face
the full 18 per cent increase. Kairos
and Hammarskjold houses, whose
members are billed directly on thePTR
and not as a group, will pay $804 next
year.
The difference, explained Highfield,
occurs because group-billed houses
receive a two per cent discount.
The decision on whether to make
Androgeny a group or PTR billed
house has not been made yet. High
field said Androgeny would "almost
certainly be a group billed house in
two years," but residents might be bil
led on their PTRs at first.

Norm Robinson, acting associate dean
of student affairs.
The increase was announced at a
Wednesday meeting with house man
agers. Not covered by the rise will be
four hoi-ses. They are the Sigma Chi
and Thefa Xi fraternities and Theta Chi
and Phi Sig co-ops. All four houses
lease only their land from the Univer
sity and own their buildings.
The figures were arrived at "accord
ing to a formula," said Robinson, to
better reflect real costs of housing to

day.
Co-op costs had been about 10 per
cent lower than those of other houses,
said Robinson, and now "utilities in
particular are bearing a larger per
cent" of the total housing costs.
"That's the reason for the magnitudi
nal jump," he said.
'Song and dance'
"There will be no more song and
dance," Robinson said, after the for
mula for the increases had been
explained. He admitted that in past
years no specific break down of hous
ing costs had been made.
The 11 fraternities and seven of the
co-ops will see a 16 per cent mark-up
in their housing costs.
These are the residences which are
charged a lump sum for rent, rather
than having individuals each be billed

on Permits To Register (PTRs). For
frats and group-billed co-ops, indi
viduals will pay $788 next year, up
from $680 this year, according to the
report by Scoles and Robinson.
Housing charges to a resident have
been broken down into four categories
for the self-operated houses. Residen
tial education, which includes costs
for house associates (RAs) and the Row
Housing Office, will be $108 next year.
Utilities will run $166 and a kitchen
and dining room use fee with be $99.
All other costs, a category which in
cludes costs for repair, debt services
and costs for the Residential Manage
ment Office, will be $431.
The Dekes
Randy Barnes, house manager for
the Delta Kappa Epsilon house (De
kes), said the Dekes "don't want any
part of Residential Education" and
that he doesn't "think any other frater
nities do either." Barnes said "Stan
ford wants to assimilate the fraternities
into the housing system."
Robinson said the "fraternities are a
very real part of the housing system —
an integral part."
He added that the purpose of the
guaranteed housing system was to
"get rid of the inequities" between
fraternities and co-ops. The frater
nities only differ from the co-ops in
method of selection.
Only two houses will definitely face
the full 18 per cent increase. Kairos
and Hammarskjold houses, whose
members are billed directly on thePTR
and not as a group, will pay $804 next
year.
The difference, explained Highfield,
occurs because group-billed houses
receive a two per cent discount.
The decision on whether to make
Androgeny a group or PTR billed
house has not been made yet. High
field said Androgeny would "almost
certainly be a group billed house in
two years," but residents might be bil
led on their PTRs at first.
Housing costs for nine co-ops and 11
fraternities here will rise 16 or 18 per
cent next year, according to Richard
Highfield, assistant director of univer
sity housing.
The decision was reached by Ed
ward Scoles, director of housing, and
Norm Robinson, acting associate dean
of student affairs.
