in the 'A' league, scoring a 9-0

and Biz II defeated the Aberra

of teams took advantage of the
10-run rule, which awards an
immediate victory to a team

The Beavers became the leaders
in the contest for the season's
shortest game as they whalloped
Eucalypto, 17-3, in three in

four innings. The Alpha Delts

crushed Arroyo, 18-2, while the
Eesies were whipped, 15-2, by
the Phi Delts. The KAs stopped
the American Studs, 15-5, and
the Zetes won their second
straight easy victory with an
11-1 win over the Cartesian
Plumbers.
In other 'B' league games, Los
Arcos beat BMF, 8-3, Kairos top
ped the Law School, 12-5, and
powerful Hurlburt just squeaked
past Sigma Chi, 5-3. Rinconada
scored six times in the first in
ning and held on for a 9-7 win
over Roble, while JRA beat the
Hallelujah Batters, 11-2.
Coed-power Soto led off its

season with a convincing 12-1

the team called Hey, a pre
season favorite, topped Pia Mci
ter, 11-7.
Volleyball started its season
last week with a full slate of 'A'

matches. In a major 'A' league

in three sets by an 11-15, 15-13,
15-11 score.
