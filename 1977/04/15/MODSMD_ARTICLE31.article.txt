# Merry-go-round
## 'Ancients' keep in stride

RECORD FEET. Dick Schupbach, assistant
professor of Russian, Larry Washington, assis
tant math prof, medical center staff member
Jack Bellah and cross country coach Marshall
Clark teamed forces to tumble the national
college-university faculty-staff two-mile relay
record last week by churning through eight laps
in 8:15.6. The old mark of 8:19 plus, was set by
an institution in Kansas whose half-milers con
sidered it untouchable.
Stanford faculty and staff members, many of
them Angell Field Ancients, will pursue more
records Sunday when Hayward State hosts the
third annual California College & University
Faculty-Staff Track and Field Competition.
One staff member will draw a few second
glances and taunts of "ringer" when he starts
running Sunday. Tony Sandoval, currently
working for the Engineering Department, re
turned recently from the World Cross-Country
Championships in Germany. The 1976 Pac-8
10,000-meter champ, Sandoval has been work
ing here before leaving for the University of
Colorado Medical School where he begins clas
ses in August.
For those of us not quite of Sandoval's caliber,
the 7 V2-mile Bay-to-Breakers race is offered May
14 in San Francisco. Official entries are due by
next Friday.

FEEDBACK. Some of those favoring the Grif
fin as the Stanford athletic mascot have started
seeing Griffins everywhere, including where
they don't exist, i.e. The creature on your Coors

beer can is not a Griffin but a heraldic lion.

QB VII. College Football Weekly has named
Guy Benjamin, Bill Walsh's No. 1 QB, to its
first-team preseason All-America squad. The
gifted signal caller will also appear on the cover
of Street and Smith's magazine's Western
edition. And word comes down that Guy has a
good shot to make one of America's most pre
stigious preseason teams; its only natural with
his hedonistic reputation that Benjamin be cho
sen by Playboy for its grid picks.

BRIDGE AFTER TROUBLED WATER. Al
though tomorrow's meet with USC will be
closer than the last three meets, there is no hope
that the Cards will break their string of 40 losses
to the Trojans. In that long hiatus since the
Cards last beat SC, the Cards have come close on
occasion; indeed, the Cards lost by just one
point in 1963.
That year the Trojans came north to battle the
Cards in Stanford Stadium when a downpour
(Remember? It used to rain here.) washed out
the Card track. The meet was postponed from
Saturday to Monday; until the Southern Cal
coach said Saturday or nothing.
After securing the use of the all-weather track
at nearby Foothill College, coach Payton Jordan
set about rounding up his athletes. He found all
of his mainstays except jumper Sheridan Dow
ney. Downey had left town for a bridge tourna
ment and could not be found. His absence,
though no fault of his own, cost Stanford sev
eral points and the meet.
