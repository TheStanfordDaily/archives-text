## 'Speed City' relocates on Farm 
### Chris Baker 
Nicknames have been a part of
the sports world ever since the
first public relations man. Some
of them have been deserved, but
most are made up to fill stadiums
or win awards.
About 10 years ago, when San
Jose State was supplying the
U.S. Olympic track team with
most of its talent, sports writers
dubbed it "Speed City."
But "Speed City" on the
Farm?
Stanford hasn't beaten UCLA
in 11 years. The last time the
Cardinals beat USC was 1933.
Migration north
But lately the Bay Area sports
pages have been claiming that
"Speed City" has moved north.
Last February the Cards' 440-
yard relay squad of Marvin
Holmes, James Lofton, Gordon
Banks and Alan Sheats beat the
Spartans with a 40.8 clocking.
Sheats came back to take the
quarter-mile and Lofton later
won the 220. But the biggest
shock was still to come—the
mile relay. Lofton, running the
final leg against NCAA hurdles
king Dedy Cooper, finished al
most 10 yards ahead of the cocky
Spartan star to give Stanford a
victory.
Coach Payton Jordan remem
bered what happened when Lof
ton met the press after the meet.
"James jokingly said, 'Just tell
them "Speed City" moved
north.' It started out as kind of a
joke. James has a dry and good
sense of humor."
Los Angeles transplants
All four members of Stanford's
reincarnation of "Speed City"
moved north—they're all from
the Los Angeles area. "They're
all kids that wanted an educa
tion," said Jordan. "They felt
comfortable coming to Stan
ford." Holmes, a senior, is the
veteran of the group. Lofton and

Sheats are both juniors and
Banks, a freshman, is the new
comer. "James had quite a bit to
do with Gordy (Banks) coming
here, said the veteran track
coach. "There wasn't any snow
job."
The addition of Banks has
given Stanford what Jordan
terms, "The best group of sprin
ters since we broke the world
440-relay record in 1965."
Motivation
Banks, who lives "10 minutes
from USC," will have extra
motivation for having a good day
against the Trojans tomorrow af
ternoon at Berkeley. But the
freshman, who had bests of 9.6
and 21.2 as a prep, also had some
extra motivation earlier this
year.
"When I came here 1 knew I
was good," said Banks. "I
wanted to let people know 1 was
no fluke. 1 wanted to let people
know I was for real."
Banks' 10.40 in the 100 meters
is the fourth fastest mark in the
conference this year. Lofton and
Sheats have clocked 46.6 for 400
meters. Lofton also has a best of
20.7 in the 200. Holmes owns a
10.48 in the century.
The quartet's 39.8 in the
400-meter relay is the third fas
test time in the league.
Aids jumping
Lofton, who finished fifth in
the long jump in the U.S. Olym
pic trials last year, said running
helps his specialty. "All the best
long jumpers have been good
sprinters. If you're going to be a
good long jumper—you've got to
be a good runner."
Lofton and Banks tried their
hand at other events last week
against Occidental. Running his
first 100 in two years, Lofton ran
a 10.7. Banks, switching to the
400, ran a 49.9 to finish second.
"We'll be ready to run this

week," said the freshman.
Sheats said, "We've been wait
ing for a good 400 relay team for
a long time. We're just getting
ridiculous."
Sheats said Stanford is build
ing a tradition in the relays and

short sprints.
"It's going to be continued
when we leave," said Sheats.
Lofton said, "When we go up
to the line in the Pac-Bs, we want
people to know that they're run
ning for second place."

NCAA crown holder USC. Banks holds the Stanford frosh records for 100- and 200-meters while
Lofton owns the school mark in the long jump, 26-9, currently the best mark in the world for 1977.
Lofton also owns the team's best mark in the 200 and shares the best 400 mark with Alan Sheats.
