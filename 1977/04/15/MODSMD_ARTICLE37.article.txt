FDA may allow medicinal saccharine
Washington — The Food and Drug Administra
tion (FDA), which is banning saccharine as a food
additive, announced yesterday it will allow the con
tinued sale of saccharine pills and powders if shown
proof they are effective in controlling obesity and
diabetes.
Under the approach announced by FDA Commis
sioner Donald Kennedy, saccharine, which has
caused cancer in laboratory animals, would be ban
ned from soft drinks and other foods sometime in
July. Such use accounts for 90 per cent of the sugar
substitute consumed in the United States.
"Our intention is to eliminate the risk of cancer
from unnecessary uses of saccharine while continu
ing its availability for people who need it for medical
purposes," Kennedy told a news conference.
Yesterday's action was a follow-up to the FDA's
March 9 announcement in which the saccharine ban
was first proposed.
The proposed regulation would require that any
saccharine sold as an over-the-counter drug carry
this label:
"For use as a noncaloric sweetener when a sugar
restricted diet is medically indicated, as in patients
with diabetes. Warning: saccharine causes bladder
cancer in animals. Use of saccharine may increase
your risk of cancer."
Kennedy said that based on Canadian studies with
laboratory rats and what is known about cancer
causing substances, "our scientists now calculate
that a moderate use of saccharine, the amount pre
sent in one large diet soft drink, if ingested daily
over a lifetime by every American, might lead to
1200 additional cases of bladder cancer per year."
State committee supports press
Sacramento — Proposed constitutional protection

for a reporter's right to keep sources confidential
won assembly committee approval yesterday de
spite one member's complaint about journalists.
"Most reporters think of themselves as the second
coming of Woodward and Bernstein, and editors
think of themselves as a combination of H.L. Men
cken and William Randolph Hearst," said Assemb
lyman Walter Ingalls (D-Riverside).
But he was on the losing side of a 6-4 vote in the
assembly Judiciary Committee that sent the constitu
tional amendment by Assemblyman Jerry Lewis
(R-Highland) to the assembly floor.
The measure was prompted by the publicized
cases of Los Angeles reporter William Farr and four
Fresno Bee newsmen who served jail terms for refus
ing to tell a judge the sources of their stories.
In both cases, the judges said the state's existing
"shield" law, that declares reporters cannot be
forced to name confidential sources, was out
weighed by judges'authority over the court and their
duty to conduct a fair trial.
Lewis' measure, if approved by the legislature and
voters, would write protection for reporters into the
state constitution. Then, he said, judges probably
could not disregard it.
Biology text ruled unconstitutional
Indianapolis — It is unconstitutional for public
schools to use a ninth-grade biology textbook that
promotes the biblical theory of creation and says
"there is no way to support the doctrine of evolu
tion," a judge ruled yesterday.
Marion Superior Court Judge Michael Dugan said
the book, Biology: A Search for Order in Complex
ity, is clearly one-sided and violates constitutional
provisions on separation of church and state.
"The prospect of biology teachers and students

alike forced to answer and respond to continued
demand for correct fundamentalist Christian doc
trines has no place in the public schools," Dugan
said. '
His ruling came in a suit brought by the Indiana
Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the parents of two
students using the book.
Irving Fink, an attorney for the parents, said the
book, published by the Zondervan Publishing House
ofGrand Rapids, Mich., either has been adopted or is
being considered for use in Texas, Arkansas, Ten
nessee and California.
Handicapped continue HEW protest
San Francisco — Saying they're proving their
physical and emotional strength, more than 125 dis
abled demonstrators doggedly marked the 10th day
of a Federal Building sit-in here yesterday.
"After we leave this place, we'll have proven that
whatever label society has placed on us doesn't
mean we're any less capable," said Judy Heumann,
one of the organizers of the protest at the regional
headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare.
The protesters vow they'll continue their occupa
tion of the fourth floor until HEW Secretary Joseph
Califano signs regulations implementing 1973 legis
lation outlawing discrimination against the hand
icapped. Califano has said he'll sign the measure by
early May.
