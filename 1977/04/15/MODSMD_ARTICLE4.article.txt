# 2000 seek recall of ASSU finance head
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
Approximately 2000 signatures, 200
more than the needed number, have
been collected on a petition to recall
ASSU Financial Manager Chris Mathe,
according to Sen. Jeff Stoler, member
of the Hammer & Coffin Society.
The petition asks the recall of Mathe
because of his violation of an ASSU
by-law passed Jan. 28. It also asks
Mathe's spring quarter salary of about
$800 be withheld, said Jim King,
another Hammer & Coffin affiliate.
"I don't know whether a salary
withdrawal is constitutional or not,"
said King, but explained that he or
Stoler would bring up the matter at
Monday's senate meeting.
King explained they were circulat
ing the petition because of Mathe's re
fusal to obey a senate resolution in
structing him to change the way fee
assessment refunds are issued.
White Plaza
The resolution calls for having re
funds in White Plaza instead of in the

ASSU office, and having student
groups issue refunds on their own as
sessments, rather than having ASSU
do the refunding.
'Guidelines'
"Mathe should have known about
the administrative problems before,"
said King. "The senate worked on
them for several weeks â€” he could
have come to us and explained the
problem three months ago and we
would have given him guidelines."
Mathe explained he didn't do any
thing about the resolution until two
weeks ago because he "didn't think it
was as seriousas this. 1 grossly undere
stimated the effect it has had on some
of the senators. I'm still flabber
gasted," Mathe commented.
"To tell you the truth," continued
Mathe, "there were grumblings the re
solution was going to be repealed. I got
the general feeling some of the
senators thought it was dumb, so 1 just
let it ride," he said.
Sen. Tim Ferguson said he also
heard "rumblings," basically from
Stoler; But that was only talk, no one
did anything. The dumb thing in the
resolution is having the student or
ganizations distribute the refunds. I'm
embarrassed it got passed me," said
Ferguson.
Ferguson doubts
Ferguson said he doubts Mathe will
be recalled because he suspects the se
nate will vote to delete the clause re
quiring student organizations to dis
tribute the money, and just ask Mathe
tc distribute the money as he has in the
past except for a location change to
White Plaza. Ferguson said he thinks
Mathe will comply with the amended
resolution.
"If Mathe doesn't agree, then I think
the senate will be in the mood to take
some action," remarked Ferguson.
Ferguson also said he thought the
senate had the power to get rid of
Mathe if it desired by simply firing
him, without resorting to a recall elec
tion.
Carole Houck, ASSU vice president,
also said she thought it might "be ar
guable" that the senate could fire
Mathe, who is a senate-appointee.
"The power to recall is in the con
stitution to allow students to get rid of
ASSU officials," she explained. She
said she didn't know of anything in the
ASSU constitution or by-laws pro
hibiting the senate from firing the fi
nancial manager.
"If it comes to a vote for recall. I'm
going to fight it," stated Mathe.
