# Faculty Senate may discuss South African investments
## 
### Bill Sing 
A resolution proposing that the faculty examine its own
role in defining a "substantial consensus" on the Universi
ty's moral responsibilities in South African corporate in
vestments was introduced to the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The proposed resolution will go before the senate's steer
ing committee, which will discuss the resolution and de
cide whether to place it on the agenda for action at the next
senate meeting April 28.
The resolution, submitted by Assoc. English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz, points to a "Statement on Investment Responsibil
ity" adopted by the Board of Trustees in April 1971 which
requires that a "substantial consensus" exist on the "unde
sirable social, economic and political acts" of companies in
which the University's funds are invested before such acts
will affect trustees' decisions on investments.
Specifically, the resolution proposes that:
1) the (Faculty) Senate should discuss the issue of defin
ing and discovering "substantial consensus" in such mat
ters;
2) the University's Commission on Investment Responsi
bility should themselves take the initiative, after consulta
tion with the University community, in drawing up
shareholders' proposals that address crucial moral, social
and political problems in relationship to investments;
3) the Board of Trustees should vote its shareholders'
proxies against new U.S. corporate investment in South
Africa; and
4) the Board of Trustees should vote its proxies on May 4
in favor of the proposal that Phelps-Dodge not expand its
investments in South Africa. (Stanford holds 30,000 shares
of Phelps-Dodge stock.)
"We need not be reminded of the inhumanity of apar
theid," said Rebholz, "but we do perhaps need to be re
minded of the aid given the government responsible for it
by the companies in which we invest.

"We (the faculty) have talked much about the budget, but
we should also examine the moral questions raised by some
of the ways which the budgeted money comes into the
University," he added.
"We have a duty to be informed and then take whatever
action we as a faculty can."
Rebholz said that it is "a pity that, as usual, we (the
faculty) came to an awareness of this issue so late, and as a
result largely of students teaching us."
The Board of Trustees had voted Tuesday, amid student
demonstrations, to abstain on shareholder proxies to limit
or end U.S. investment in South Africa. Trustees also voted
to send letters to corporate managements urging acceler
ated progress on black employment practices there.
Stanford holds 887,000 shares worth approximately $40
million in six firms affected by the proxy issue — Caltex,
Union Carbide, General Electric. Phelps-Dodge, Ford and
General Motors.
Rebholz said the faculty should request that trustees ad
dress a particular letter to General Electric (GE), which has
not accepted a statement adopted by 12 other major U.S.
firms favoring equal employment opportunities for blacks
in South Africa.
Such a letter should say that the University would divest
itself of GE stock "if GE does not accept" the equal employ
ment principles.
Whether or not the faculty can reach any consensus on
the moral questions here, "its important for us to face up to
an extremely difficult and complex issue," said Rebholz.
Also at yesterday's meeting, Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich reported that the Medical School is facing the
prospect of severe financial constraints and external regula
tion which may make it "difficult" for the school to main
tain a kind of environment conducive for doing its research
and teaching functions.

investments in South Africa. (Stanford holds 30,000 shares
of Phelps-Dodge stock.)
"We need not be reminded of the inhumanity of apar
theid," said Rebholz, "but we do perhaps need to be re
minded of the aid given the government responsible for it
by the companies in which we invest.

"We (the faculty) have talked much about the budget, but
we should also examine the moral questions raised by some
of the ways which the budgeted money comes into the
University," he added.
"We have a duty to be informed and then take whatever
action we as a faculty can."
Rebholz said that it is "a pity that, as usual, we (the
faculty) came to an awareness of this issue so late, and as a
result largely of students teaching us."
The Board of Trustees had voted Tuesday, amid student
demonstrations, to abstain on shareholder proxies to limit
or end U.S. investment in South Africa. Trustees also voted
to send letters to corporate managements urging acceler
ated progress on black employment practices there.
Stanford holds 887,000 shares worth approximately $40
million in six firms affected by the proxy issue — Caltex,
Union Carbide, General Electric. Phelps-Dodge, Ford and
General Motors.
Rebholz said the faculty should request that trustees ad
dress a particular letter to General Electric (GE), which has
not accepted a statement adopted by 12 other major U.S.
firms favoring equal employment opportunities for blacks
in South Africa.
Such a letter should say that the University would divest
itself of GE stock "if GE does not accept" the equal employ
ment principles.
Whether or not the faculty can reach any consensus on
the moral questions here, "its important for us to face up to
an extremely difficult and complex issue," said Rebholz.
Also at yesterday's meeting, Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich reported that the Medical School is facing the
prospect of severe financial constraints and external regula
tion which may make it "difficult" for the school to main
tain a kind of environment conducive for doing its research
and teaching functions.
A resolution proposing that the faculty examine its own
role in defining a "substantial consensus" on the Universi
ty's moral responsibilities in South African corporate in
vestments was introduced to the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The proposed resolution will go before the senate's steer
ing committee, which will discuss the resolution and de
cide whether to place it on the agenda for action at the next
senate meeting April 28.
The resolution, submitted by Assoc. English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz, points to a "Statement on Investment Responsibil
ity" adopted by the Board of Trustees in April 1971 which
requires that a "substantial consensus" exist on the "unde
sirable social, economic and political acts" of companies in
which the University's funds are invested before such acts
will affect trustees' decisions on investments.
Specifically, the resolution proposes that:
1) the (Faculty) Senate should discuss the issue of defin
ing and discovering "substantial consensus" in such mat
ters;
2) the University's Commission on Investment Responsi
bility should themselves take the initiative, after consulta
tion with the University community, in drawing up
shareholders' proposals that address crucial moral, social
and political problems in relationship to investments;
3) the Board of Trustees should vote its shareholders'
proxies against new U.S. corporate investment in South
Africa; and
4) the Board of Trustees should vote its proxies on May 4
in favor of the proposal that Phelps-Dodge not expand its
investments in South Africa. (Stanford holds 30,000 shares
of Phelps-Dodge stock.)
