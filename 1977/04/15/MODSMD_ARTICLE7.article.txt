# Carter withholds tax rebates

### 
Washington (AP) —Americans
won't be getting $50 tax rebates from
Uncle Sam after all because President
Jimmy Carter has decided the
economy is doing well enough with
out them, the White House said yes
terday.
Taxpayers who spent their rebates in
advance—and economists say there
maybe many of them—apparently will
be out of luck. But stock traders, wor
ried that rebates would be inflationary,
reacted with enthusiasm.
The Dow Jones average of 30 indust

rial stocks, up more than 13 points dur
ing the day, closed ahead 8.82 points at
947.0 The average has gained 32.27
points over the past five sessions.
Carter is to announce his anti
i nflation program at a news conference
today.
Scrap the rebate
The decision to scrap the rebate was
made Wednesday night and obviously
caught some advisers by surprise. Both
Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blu
menthal and Labor Secretary Ray Mar
shall made speeches in recent days ar

guing for the rebate.
Also scrapped was a proposed 2 per
cent increase in the investment tax
credit for business.
The rebate would have put about
$10 billion in the pockets of taxpayers,
and the credit would have given busi
ness about $2 billion.
An average family of four with in
come below $20,000 could have ex
pected $200 in rebates.
'Not enough'
"That's not enough for a down pay
ment on a new car," one government
economist said, "but it will buy a tele
vision set, a washing machine or a new
suit of clothes."
Both the rebate and the investment
tax credit were major elements in the
$31 billion, two-year economic
stimulus program that Carter proposed
to Congress soon after taking office.
The rebate plan was in trouble in the
Senate, largely because of fears it
would fuel inflation and do little to
help the economy. But administration
spokesmen insisted the decision to
scrap the rebates was made for
economic reasons, not political con
siderations.
Both Blumenthal and Budget Direc
tor Bert Lance led the move to con
vince Carter to withdraw the rebate
plan, one source said.
'Looking strong'
"They told him the economy was
looking strong enough without
it...Most economic indicators except
for the stock market are looking
stronger."
Whatever the reason, the reaction in
the Senate was swift and favorable.
Carter called key senators Wednesday
night to inform them after the decision
was made.
Almost simultaneous with Carter's
announcement, the Federal Reserve
Board said a sharp rise in auto produc
tion helped push the nation's indust
rial output up by the biggest margin in
19 months during March.
The Federal Reserve said its index of
industrial production climbed by 1.4
per cent, compared to a 1 per cent
climb in February and an eight-tenths
of 1 per cent drop in January, when
severe winter weather constricted the
economy.
