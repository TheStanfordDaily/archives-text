## TV series on Italy 'superficial' 
### 
Mazza et al.

During the past three or four months
the name of Stanford University has
been associated with a series of politi
cal and cultural commentaries on con
temporary Italy prepared for a local TV
station by Dr. Angelo Codevilla, visit
ing scholar at the Hoover Foundation
who presently teaches courses on Italy
in the French and Italian Department.
These commentaries are broadcast on
Channel 26 every Sunday night at 8
p.m. as part of an Italian language
program directed toward the Italian
community in the Bay Area.'
We, the undersigned, feel that these
transmissions are probably having
some impact in shaping the image of
contemporary Italy in the minds of
many people who have not had the
chance to visit our country in the last
few years; therefore, we think it neces
sary to speak out against the interpre
tation of the present Italian situation
given by Codevilla.
In each of his television appear
ances, Codevilla has put great effort
into depicting Italy as a country domi

nated by violence, chaos, strikes and
spreading leftism.
The arguments he has used to sup
port this view, however, have con
vinced us of one thing: that he lacks
the basic factual background neces
sary for understanding Italian society.
As an example, considering what has
happened in Italian politics in the last
15 years, it is difficult to take seriously
his statement that the center-left coali
tion of the early '60s was intentionally
started by the Italian Socialist Party
with the aim of opening the road to the
Communist Party's participation in
the government of the country.
In most cases, his political commen
taries have been so unrealistic, so in
credibly biased, and formulated in
such shaky Italian, that we find it sur
prising that he was selected as a rep
resentative of Italian culture at Stan
ford in these transmissions.
His political bias became more evi
dent when he alluded to the "moral
decadence" of contemporary Italian
society, as exemplified, in his opinion,

by the novel Porci con le Ali (Pigs with
Wings). To compare, as Codevilla
chose to do, such a minor contempor
ary novel with past masterpieces of Ita
lian literature like Dante's Divine
Comedy and Manzoni's Promessi
Sposi is perhaps no more valid than to
evaluate the state of present Italian ar
chitecture by comparing a small mod
ern church with Bernini's St. Peter's
Square.
Codevilla, like every one of us, has
the right to hold his own political
ideas. What we disapprove of is the
naivete with which he depicts the Ita
lian situation, striving as he does, to
discredit and to put the blame on only
one political side without even touch
ing the heavy responsibility of the
traditional ruling class for what has
happened to Italian society injthe last
30 years.
We are not trying to ignore severe
social,and therefore political, tensions
present in Italy today. Indeed, these
are greater now than at any time in
post-war Italian history; however, we

are very concerned about the implica
tions contained in Codevilla's com
mentaries.
It is very unfortunate that the De
partment of French and Italian appears
to endorse through its cultural prestige
these superficial views on Italy.
If a more "objective" and more
knowledgeable commentator is not
available it would be more fair to or
ganize a debate on political and cul
tural issues between people of diffe
rent viewpoints so as to provide
people of Italian descent living in this
part of the United States with a more
complete and less biased interpreta
tion of Italian life.
