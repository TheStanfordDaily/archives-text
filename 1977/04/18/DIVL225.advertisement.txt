THE DEAN OF BEER'S QUICKIE QUIZ.
Q: Chill-Lagering is:
a) A popular German country and western singer.
b) A Scandinavian winter sport played without clothes.
c) A new ethnic TV comedy about the owner of an ice
cube factory.
d) The right way to age beer.
A: (d) Sorry, Chill-Lagering is not Olga and Svend
running around in a snowstorm in their birthday
suits. Chill-Lagering is the way Schlitz ages beer.
They age it cold. Very cold. Down to 29.5 degrees.
The result is a beer with sparkling clarity. A
beer thats crisp, clean and bright.
I suggest you look into one right now.
