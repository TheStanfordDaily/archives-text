# Protestors face legal intimidation
##

Coleman et al

On Tuesday, April 12, over 200
people participated in a demonstra
tion against the presence of a Marine
Corps recruiter at the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC). The/ol
lowing joint statement was written by
those demonstrators whose position at
the back entrance of the CPPC in
volved them in a physical confronta
tion with the police.
We feel it is important to make clear
to the Stanford community why we
oppose recruiting Marines at Stanford;
why we took the action we did, how
we perceived the police reaction to our
action and how we view the threat of
criminal charges being brought
against us.
What are our objections to the
Marine Corps? Is the Marino Corps not
a vital element in the total U.S. milit
ary "defense" posture, necessary for
such demanding operations as the
amphibious landings in the last two
World Wars?
Or has the crucial function of the
Marine Corps become to spearhead
U.S. interventions around the world
wherever American interests are
threatened, regardless of how legiti
mate the political forces threatening
those interests are? We remember
Lebanon in 1958, the Dominican Re

public in 1965, Vietnam and Cam
bodia;'we come to the second conclu
sion.
Spearheading interventions around
the world requires a special kind of
military force, one that is extremely
authoritarian and one that emphasizes
blind obedience, a brutal machismo,
and most importantly racism.
As Africa has become the trouble
spot in the Third World, the high per
centage of blacks in the Marine Corps
has become a great concern to the
Marine commandant. There can be no
other explanation for the official ac
quiescence in the vicious harassment
of blacks by the Klu Klux Klan at Camp
Pendleton which eventually led to the
fight for which 14 blacks are now fac
ing a total of 214 years imprisonment.
For us, as for the scores of other pro
testors at the CPPC last Tuesday, an
organization as brutal and racist as the
Marines should not be permitted to
make use of University resources in
order to recruit some of "the cream of
the crop."
By granting the use of those re
sources, the University is not simply
taking a neutral position towards the
Marines, allowing everyone the "right
to his viewpoint;" the University is
giving active support to the brutality
and racism embodied in the Marines.

We felt that the moral objections to
Marine recruiting on campus were suf
ficient to call for a strong statement of
protest, a statement that culminated in
our stance before the back doors of the
CPPC in anticipation of the arrival of
the Marine recruiter.
We hoped to convince the recruiter
not to enter the building, a goal such
protests have accomplished in the
past. We had explicitly agreed among
ourselves beforehand, however, that
our action would remain non-violent
and that if we were asked to disperse,
we would do so.
From the experience many of us pre
sent have had in deal ing with the cam
pus police in the J.P. Stevens sit-in last
quarter, we had found them to be em
minently reasonable, careful not to
provoke any unnecessary incidents.
Thus, we can hardly express how
shocked we were when Chief Marvin
Herrington approached us with two
other police officers and the Marine
recruiter, flashed his badge and with
out a word immediately began shoving
his way through us, saying only that he
was coming through after he had
begun shoving.
At the same time Officer Bruno
thrust open the door behind us and
began pushing and pulling, creating
an enormous amount of confusion and

trapping people in the middle between
the two pushing forces.
The instinctive reaction of most of
us was to huddle together in self
protection. Finally, after violently
grapping heads, bodies, shirts and
hair, the police made their way into the
CPPC.
Given that this is how we experi
enced the incident, we were once
again shocked to subsequently dis
cover we were possibly going to have
criminal charges brought against us!
We, in fact, were just in the process of
discussing what kind of action to take
against the University for the man
handling we had been subjected to,
when we discovered Herrington's in
tentions.
We can only interpret this action on
the part of the University as an attempt
to intimidate and discourage us from
engaging in any further demonstra
tions of our opposition to University
policy.
We intend to make clear to the Uni
versity, however, that we will not be
intimidated, but rather that we will
press forward with renewed determi
nation to compel the University to live
up to its moral and social respon
sibilities.

participated in the demonstration.)
