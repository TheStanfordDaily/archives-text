# Students need social center
##

Weiss, McCarthy

The University has done an incredi
ble amount of expansion in the past
few years and yet there is still no place
where students can meet and activities
can be organized. The University has
in the past placed an emphasis on resi
dential education.
Activities are supposed to be or
ganized around the dorm. The only
trouble with this idea is that it ignores
the 5500 off-campus students as well
as graduate students in Escondido and
Crothers. The campus is split into
separate units. There is little sense of
community.
If the quality of student life is to im
prove the University should turn over
to students space that should be theirs.

Academic departments have taken
over the Old Union over the years and
Tresidder which was initiated with
student money does not have any
space for students.
The bank and the Travel Service oc
cupy what once used to be meeting
and program space and the Office of
Student Activities is located where the
music listening room used to be.
Tresidder Union has become a "pro
fitmaking" institution. That perhaps
may be an overstatement. The Univer
sity has been unable to make it pay and
has had to resort to letting TDS run the
Transition and the Coffee House.
The University has its priorities
right. It subsidizes the Faculty Club

but not Tresidder. The faculty can get
excellent food inexpensively: "all you
can eat" buffet for $3.15. The same will
buy you a main dish and a salad at the
Transition but what a difference! In
short, the University has neglected to
extend the same services to all stu
dents and it simply has not done
enough.
Stanford students lack a sense of
community. Many feel isolated and
apathetic. A student center, a center
created by ourselves will be a step in
the right direction. Students should
definitely not be left out of the game of
musical spaces. Student organizations
should not have to operate from dorm

rooms. Student drama productions
should not have to use converted
lounges and dining rooms.
A task force is being currently set up
in conjunction with SCIRE and the Of
fice of Student Activities. If you are
interested in helping lobby for a stu
dent center or just have a suggestion
leave a message with Janet Shaver (the
student co-director of SCIRE) at the
SCIRE office 590 Old Union 497-4504
and come to an organizational meeting
at 4 p.m. today in the Off-Campus stu
dent lounge in the Women's
Clubhouse.
