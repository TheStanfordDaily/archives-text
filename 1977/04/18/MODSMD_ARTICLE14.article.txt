# States legalize gambling to increase revenues
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —States
hungry for revenue are increas
ingly turning to state lotteries
and other forms of legalized
gambling to raise cash.
Lotteries run by 13 states gros
sed $1.1 billion last year, or a
25-fold increase over five years
earl ier, according to the National
Association of State Lotteries.
The association expects further
increases both in the number of
states running lotteries and the
take for those already offering
them.
One state lottery director, Wil
liam Ferrault of Massachusetts,
says running a lottery is like
running a business. He calls the
lottery field "the fastest
emerging industry in the United
States."
After a lapse of 70 years,
legalized lotteries were revived
in 1964 by New Hampshire. At
the time, state taxes from wager
ing at horse racing tracks consti
tuted the primary source of state
revenue from gambling.
Other lotteries
Other state-run lotteries are
held in Connecticut, Delaware,
Illinois, Maine, Michigan, New
Jersey, Ohio, Maryland, Mas
sachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island and New York.
The early New Hampshire lot
tery was a semi-annual drawing,
a timid scale compared to the lot
teries being run now.
Present lotteries offer many
different types of contests, with
the common features, according
to Perrault, "small investment to
enter, a simple game and big
prizes."
Weekly drawings are held by
most of the states that have lot
teries. Other types of lotteries are
an "instant game," where a per
son buys a card and can use the
edge of a coin to scratch off a
covering and find out im

mediately if he has a winning
card, and a "numbers game,"
similar to gambling operations
long run illegally in many areas.
The difference is that the pro
ceeds of the legal lotteries go to
building schools and roads, not
into the pocket of an illegal
operator.
'Consumer product'
"We have a consumer pro
duct," Perrault said in an inter
view at a recent Washington
conference on public gaming.
"We use the same business
approach as any company would
use. We sell entertainment. We
have people turning on our
weekly television show to find
out if they have won."
State gambling officials at the
conference defended the lot
teries from those who opposed
them on moral grounds. They
maintained that people will
gamble whether it is legal or not.
Many of the state officials cited a
survey by a federal commission
on gambling policies that found
that 61 per cent of all adult
Americans gambled in 1974.
Illegal numbers games con
tinue to fluorish in most states
where there also are legal lot
teries, most speakers at the con

ference agreed. One exception
was Maryland, where lottery di
rector Stanley Fine said, "We've
won over the players. We're
growing by leaps and bounds
and the illegal game is on the run
in Maryland."
Room for growth
Officials at the conference ag
reed that there is much room for
growth in state-run gambling.
Two states now have legal
casino gambling, New York and
Connecticut have off-track bet
ting on horses and Delaware has
legal betting on sports events.
Many states are considering
legalizing new forms of gambl
ing.
One of the big areas for poten
tial growth is casino gambling,
which has been legal for years in
Nevada. New Jersey voters in
November approved casinos in
Atlantic City.
David Burke, director of the
Public Gaming Research Insti
tute, predicted the New Jersey
action "will pull thefingeroutof
the dike and lead to other states
following suit." He said that in
the past, states have taken up
gambling operations after they
have been successful in
neighboring states.

legalized lotteries were revived
in 1964 by New Hampshire. At
the time, state taxes from wager
ing at horse racing tracks consti
tuted the primary source of state
revenue from gambling.
Other lotteries
Other state-run lotteries are
held in Connecticut, Delaware,
Illinois, Maine, Michigan, New
Jersey, Ohio, Maryland, Mas
sachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island and New York.
The early New Hampshire lot
tery was a semi-annual drawing,
a timid scale compared to the lot
teries being run now.
Present lotteries offer many
different types of contests, with
the common features, according
to Perrault, "small investment to
enter, a simple game and big
prizes."
Weekly drawings are held by
most of the states that have lot
teries. Other types of lotteries are
an "instant game," where a per
son buys a card and can use the
edge of a coin to scratch off a
covering and find out im

mediately if he has a winning
card, and a "numbers game,"
similar to gambling operations
long run illegally in many areas.
The difference is that the pro
ceeds of the legal lotteries go to
building schools and roads, not
into the pocket of an illegal
operator.
'Consumer product'
"We have a consumer pro
duct," Perrault said in an inter
view at a recent Washington
conference on public gaming.
"We use the same business
approach as any company would
use. We sell entertainment. We
have people turning on our
weekly television show to find
out if they have won."
State gambling officials at the
conference defended the lot
teries from those who opposed
them on moral grounds. They
maintained that people will
gamble whether it is legal or not.
Many of the state officials cited a
survey by a federal commission
on gambling policies that found
that 61 per cent of all adult
Americans gambled in 1974.
Illegal numbers games con
tinue to fluorish in most states
where there also are legal lot
teries, most speakers at the con

ference agreed. One exception
was Maryland, where lottery di
rector Stanley Fine said, "We've
won over the players. We're
growing by leaps and bounds
and the illegal game is on the run
in Maryland."
Room for growth
Officials at the conference ag
reed that there is much room for
growth in state-run gambling.
Two states now have legal
casino gambling, New York and
Connecticut have off-track bet
ting on horses and Delaware has
legal betting on sports events.
Many states are considering
legalizing new forms of gambl
ing.
One of the big areas for poten
tial growth is casino gambling,
which has been legal for years in
Nevada. New Jersey voters in
November approved casinos in
Atlantic City.
David Burke, director of the
Public Gaming Research Insti
tute, predicted the New Jersey
action "will pull thefingeroutof
the dike and lead to other states
following suit." He said that in
the past, states have taken up
gambling operations after they
have been successful in
neighboring states.
Washington (AP) —States
hungry for revenue are increas
ingly turning to state lotteries
and other forms of legalized
gambling to raise cash.
Lotteries run by 13 states gros
sed $1.1 billion last year, or a
25-fold increase over five years
earl ier, according to the National
Association of State Lotteries.
The association expects further
increases both in the number of
states running lotteries and the
take for those already offering
them.
One state lottery director, Wil
liam Ferrault of Massachusetts,
says running a lottery is like
running a business. He calls the
lottery field "the fastest
emerging industry in the United
States."
After a lapse of 70 years,
legalized lotteries were revived
in 1964 by New Hampshire. At
