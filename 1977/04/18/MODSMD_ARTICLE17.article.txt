# Grand slam over USC, UCLA
## 'Maples Miracle' strikes again 
### Richard Keller 
Stanford's men's tennis team
left USC in the dust.
Saturday afternoon at the var
sity courts, the Cards walked off
with the first five matches
clinching a victory over the same
USC team that knocked off Stan
ford, 6-3, two weeks ago in Los
Angeles. This time around the
final score was 7-2 for Stanford.
In singles competition, Ferry
Wright of Stanford got past
USC's Mike Newberry 6-4, 6-4;
John Rast kept the spectators in
terested with a narrow, 5-7, 7-5,
7-6 (5-4) victory over USC's
Andy Lucchesi; the Card's Lloyd
Bourne buzzed Buzz Strode 6-2,
6-4; and Jim Hodges crowned
Earl Prince of USC 6-1, 6-1.
For Rast, a victory was some
thing special. The sophomore
has been plagued this season by
illness, a pulled muscle and a
sprained ankle. After a success
ful frosh season, he wasn't able
to recapture his form — until the
USC match.
It was 3-3 in the third set tie
breaker against Lucchesi, when
Rast double faulted.
Maples madness
"That got me so mad I said
there was no way I was going to
lose," he said. "I was frustrated

beyond belief."
On the next point, Rast got his
first serve in and followed it with
a deep volley which Lucchesi
lobbed long, to tie it at 4-4. The
match came down to one point.
"I just wanted to serve it as fast
as I could," commented Rast.
"You don't want to think about
it. I could barely get my arm up
to serve as it was.
"I lost a couple matches and a
lot of confidence," Rast said of
his early-season play. "It's taken
me a long time to get over that. I
started thinking about losing in
stead of winning.
"I felt like the whole year I had
been playing well, but I hadn't
been able to put a match to
gether. This match made a whole
terrible year worthwhile. I just
needed a win."
Double trouble
In doubles, the No. 3 team of
Hodges and Peter Rennert as
sured Stanford of the team vic
tory by burying Strode and Stan
Franker, 6-4, 6-0.
The No. 2 singles match
started things off at Maples
Pavilion Saturday night. Behind
the avid, partial cheering of the
Zeta Psi house, Maze (a Zete)
survived a shoot-out with USC's
Chris Lewis 7-6 (5-3), 7-6 (5-2).

Both players displayed power
ful serve and volley games. The
match was even all the way, but
Maze came through in the
clutch, grabbing both tie break
ers. When Maze is on top of his
game, as he was against UCLA
and USC, few opponents can
stay on the court with him.
Tangled in the net
With the game score 6-5 for
Maze in the second set, Lewis
sprinted towards the net to reach
a low shot. Amazingly, he not
only got to the ball, but he put
the shot away. Before Maze got a
change to get upset, though,
Lewis plowed into the net, and
knocked it over along with the
standards and the net judge.
Maze won the point due to inter
ference with the net, but Lewis
took the game to even the count
at 6-all.
"I guess you could say I dive
for a lot of balls," said Lewis fol
lowing the match. "I was going
for the ball and the net just hap
pened to get in the way — that's
all!"
A split second before Lewis
crashed to the floor again, he
stroked an incredible cross-court
forehand to win the first tie
breaker point. The next four tal
lies, however, went to the Stan

ford netter, and he eventually
won it, 5-2. After the final point,
Lewis proved he could jump
over the net without breaking it,
and shook Maze's hand. The
crowd responded with a stand
ing ovation.
Matt Mitchell of Stanford and
USC's Bruce Manson went after
each other in the next match of
the night. Despite coming off a
bout with the flu, Manson de
feated Mitchell for the second
time this year, 7-6 (5-2), 6-4.
Spirts of power
Mitchell was down 1-4 in the
first set before he got his game in
gear. He then blitzed his USC
opponent with four straight
games to take the lead at 5-4. In
the following game, Mitchell
had three set points, but couldn't
find the right shots to capitalize.
At 3-3 in that game, he missed an
easy overhead by a micron on the
right sideline. Manson wouldn't
have had a chance.
After braving a set point
against him Mitchell forced a tie
breaker. Manson was in charge
all the way, though, and won the
breaker, 5-2, leaving a frustrated
Mitchell slapping the court.
Mitchell scrambled back after
being broken in the second game
of the final set. He broke Manson
at love in the seventh game to
push the score to 4-4. Unfortu
nately, Manson did the same
thing in game eight.
Behind 4-5, and 0-3 (in
points), Mitchell creamed a bac
khand and then pressured Man
son to miss.a volley to make it
2-3. In a fantastic display of
quickness, the Stanford sopho
more saved three of Manson's
smashes, but still lost the match
point.

Maze came through in the
clutch, grabbing both tie break
ers. When Maze is on top of his
game, as he was against UCLA
and USC, few opponents can
stay on the court with him.
Tangled in the net
With the game score 6-5 for
Maze in the second set, Lewis
sprinted towards the net to reach
a low shot. Amazingly, he not
only got to the ball, but he put
the shot away. Before Maze got a
change to get upset, though,
Lewis plowed into the net, and
knocked it over along with the
standards and the net judge.
Maze won the point due to inter
ference with the net, but Lewis
took the game to even the count
at 6-all.
"I guess you could say I dive
for a lot of balls," said Lewis fol
lowing the match. "I was going
for the ball and the net just hap
pened to get in the way — that's
all!"
A split second before Lewis
crashed to the floor again, he
stroked an incredible cross-court
forehand to win the first tie
breaker point. The next four tal
lies, however, went to the Stan

ford netter, and he eventually
won it, 5-2. After the final point,
Lewis proved he could jump
over the net without breaking it,
and shook Maze's hand. The
crowd responded with a stand
ing ovation.
Matt Mitchell of Stanford and
USC's Bruce Manson went after
each other in the next match of
the night. Despite coming off a
bout with the flu, Manson de
feated Mitchell for the second
time this year, 7-6 (5-2), 6-4.
Spirts of power
Mitchell was down 1-4 in the
first set before he got his game in
gear. He then blitzed his USC
opponent with four straight
games to take the lead at 5-4. In
the following game, Mitchell
had three set points, but couldn't
find the right shots to capitalize.
At 3-3 in that game, he missed an
easy overhead by a micron on the
right sideline. Manson wouldn't
have had a chance.
After braving a set point
against him Mitchell forced a tie
breaker. Manson was in charge
all the way, though, and won the
breaker, 5-2, leaving a frustrated
Mitchell slapping the court.
Mitchell scrambled back after
being broken in the second game
of the final set. He broke Manson
at love in the seventh game to
push the score to 4-4. Unfortu
nately, Manson did the same
thing in game eight.
Behind 4-5, and 0-3 (in
points), Mitchell creamed a bac
khand and then pressured Man
son to miss.a volley to make it
2-3. In a fantastic display of
quickness, the Stanford sopho
more saved three of Manson's
smashes, but still lost the match
point.

Card sophomore John Rast is on the comeback trail after going into this weekend's tennis matches
against powerhouses UCLA and (JSC, 2-9. Although he was beaten at the No. 3 spot Thursday
against UCLA, Rast played a spectacular match against Trojan Andy Lucchesi winning a dramatic
tiebreaker, 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5-4).
Stanford's men's tennis team
left USC in the dust.
Saturday afternoon at the var
sity courts, the Cards walked off
with the first five matches
clinching a victory over the same
USC team that knocked off Stan
ford, 6-3, two weeks ago in Los
Angeles. This time around the
final score was 7-2 for Stanford.
In singles competition, Ferry
Wright of Stanford got past
USC's Mike Newberry 6-4, 6-4;
John Rast kept the spectators in
terested with a narrow, 5-7, 7-5,
7-6 (5-4) victory over USC's
Andy Lucchesi; the Card's Lloyd
Bourne buzzed Buzz Strode 6-2,
6-4; and Jim Hodges crowned
Earl Prince of USC 6-1, 6-1.
For Rast, a victory was some
thing special. The sophomore
has been plagued this season by
illness, a pulled muscle and a
sprained ankle. After a success
ful frosh season, he wasn't able
to recapture his form — until the
USC match.
It was 3-3 in the third set tie
breaker against Lucchesi, when
Rast double faulted.
Maples madness
"That got me so mad I said
there was no way I was going to
lose," he said. "I was frustrated

beyond belief."
On the next point, Rast got his
first serve in and followed it with
a deep volley which Lucchesi
lobbed long, to tie it at 4-4. The
match came down to one point.
"I just wanted to serve it as fast
as I could," commented Rast.
"You don't want to think about
it. I could barely get my arm up
to serve as it was.
"I lost a couple matches and a
lot of confidence," Rast said of
his early-season play. "It's taken
me a long time to get over that. I
started thinking about losing in
stead of winning.
"I felt like the whole year I had
been playing well, but I hadn't
been able to put a match to
gether. This match made a whole
terrible year worthwhile. I just
needed a win."
Double trouble
In doubles, the No. 3 team of
Hodges and Peter Rennert as
sured Stanford of the team vic
tory by burying Strode and Stan
Franker, 6-4, 6-0.
The No. 2 singles match

Card sophomore John Rast is on the comeback trail after going into this weekend's tennis matches
against powerhouses UCLA and (JSC, 2-9. Although he was beaten at the No. 3 spot Thursday
against UCLA, Rast played a spectacular match against Trojan Andy Lucchesi winning a dramatic
tiebreaker, 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5-4).
Stanford's men's tennis team
left USC in the dust.
Saturday afternoon at the var
sity courts, the Cards walked off
with the first five matches
clinching a victory over the same
USC team that knocked off Stan
ford, 6-3, two weeks ago in Los
Angeles. This time around the
final score was 7-2 for Stanford.
In singles competition, Ferry
Wright of Stanford got past
USC's Mike Newberry 6-4, 6-4;
John Rast kept the spectators in
terested with a narrow, 5-7, 7-5,
7-6 (5-4) victory over USC's
Andy Lucchesi; the Card's Lloyd
Bourne buzzed Buzz Strode 6-2,
6-4; and Jim Hodges crowned
Earl Prince of USC 6-1, 6-1.
For Rast, a victory was some
thing special. The sophomore
has been plagued this season by
illness, a pulled muscle and a
sprained ankle. After a success
ful frosh season, he wasn't able
to recapture his form — until the
USC match.
It was 3-3 in the third set tie
breaker against Lucchesi, when
Rast double faulted.
Maples madness
"That got me so mad I said
there was no way I was going to
lose," he said. "I was frustrated

beyond belief."
On the next point, Rast got his
first serve in and followed it with
a deep volley which Lucchesi
lobbed long, to tie it at 4-4. The
match came down to one point.
"I just wanted to serve it as fast
as I could," commented Rast.
"You don't want to think about
it. I could barely get my arm up
to serve as it was.
"I lost a couple matches and a
lot of confidence," Rast said of
his early-season play. "It's taken
me a long time to get over that. I
started thinking about losing in
stead of winning.
"I felt like the whole year I had
been playing well, but I hadn't
been able to put a match to
gether. This match made a whole
terrible year worthwhile. I just
needed a win."
Double trouble
In doubles, the No. 3 team of
Hodges and Peter Rennert as
sured Stanford of the team vic
tory by burying Strode and Stan
Franker, 6-4, 6-0.
The No. 2 singles match
started things off at Maples
Pavilion Saturday night. Behind
the avid, partial cheering of the
Zeta Psi house, Maze (a Zete)
survived a shoot-out with USC's
Chris Lewis 7-6 (5-3), 7-6 (5-2).

Both players displayed power
ful serve and volley games. The
match was even all the way, but
Maze came through in the
clutch, grabbing both tie break
ers. When Maze is on top of his
game, as he was against UCLA
and USC, few opponents can
stay on the court with him.
Tangled in the net
With the game score 6-5 for
Maze in the second set, Lewis
sprinted towards the net to reach
a low shot. Amazingly, he not
only got to the ball, but he put
the shot away. Before Maze got a
change to get upset, though,
Lewis plowed into the net, and
knocked it over along with the
standards and the net judge.
Maze won the point due to inter
ference with the net, but Lewis
took the game to even the count
at 6-all.
"I guess you could say I dive
for a lot of balls," said Lewis fol
lowing the match. "I was going
for the ball and the net just hap
pened to get in the way — that's
all!"
A split second before Lewis
crashed to the floor again, he
stroked an incredible cross-court
forehand to win the first tie
breaker point. The next four tal
lies, however, went to the Stan

ford netter, and he eventually
won it, 5-2. After the final point,
Lewis proved he could jump
over the net without breaking it,
and shook Maze's hand. The
crowd responded with a stand
ing ovation.
Matt Mitchell of Stanford and
USC's Bruce Manson went after
each other in the next match of
the night. Despite coming off a
bout with the flu, Manson de
feated Mitchell for the second
time this year, 7-6 (5-2), 6-4.
Spirts of power
Mitchell was down 1-4 in the
first set before he got his game in
gear. He then blitzed his USC
opponent with four straight
games to take the lead at 5-4. In
the following game, Mitchell
had three set points, but couldn't
find the right shots to capitalize.
At 3-3 in that game, he missed an
easy overhead by a micron on the
right sideline. Manson wouldn't
have had a chance.
After braving a set point
against him Mitchell forced a tie
breaker. Manson was in charge
all the way, though, and won the
breaker, 5-2, leaving a frustrated
Mitchell slapping the court.
Mitchell scrambled back after
being broken in the second game
of the final set. He broke Manson
at love in the seventh game to
push the score to 4-4. Unfortu
nately, Manson did the same
thing in game eight.
Behind 4-5, and 0-3 (in
points), Mitchell creamed a bac
khand and then pressured Man
son to miss.a volley to make it
2-3. In a fantastic display of
quickness, the Stanford sopho
more saved three of Manson's
smashes, but still lost the match
point.
