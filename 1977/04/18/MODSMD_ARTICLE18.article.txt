The Stanford crew team won
its varsity race the hard way by
taking one-and-a-half boat
lengths in the last 200 meter
sprint to win by 3.7 seconds over
Long Beach State Saturday.
In other races, the frosh eight
had an impressive three length
win over Long Beach and Santa
Clara, and the JV took second to
Santa Clara's lightweight eight.
The race strategy devised in
workouts this week by Card

from their usual 34.
This weekend the team travels
