# Congress to tackle Carter's energy plan
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —Congress is em
barking on what may be the fiercest
legislative battle in years as it returns
from its Easter recess to receive Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's complex program
of stiff energy conservation remedies
and new energy taxes.
The president is set to highlight di
mensions of the nation's energy prob
lem in a televised "fireside chat" to the
nation tonight and then to formally
unveil his energy package at a joint
House-Senate session on Wednesday.
Members of Congress who have re
ceived briefings on the energy prog
ram predict Carter's program will
touch off heated debates.
Many elements of the package,
especially those that would cost con
sumers the most in added energy costs,
may never make it through Congress,
or may be substantially modified,
some congressional aides contend.
Appeal to the people
Several congressional leaders have
suggested that the president will have
so much difficulty getting his proposal
through Congress that he may have to
resort to making his appeal directly to
the people—in forums such as his
"fireside chat"—in order to build sup
port.
The biggest battles are certain to be
over proposed new taxes on gasoline
and other petroleum products ex
pected to be in the president's energy
message. Least controversial, key con
gressmen and aides agree, will be con
servation incentives, such as proposed
tax benefits for homeowners who im
prove insulation in their houses or in
stall solar energy devices.
White House aides said that in his
televised address to the nation tonight,
Carter will draw heavily on a new CIA
report which concludes that the world
has far less oil and natural gas in re
serve than has been generally be
lieved.
According to published accounts,
the CIA report claims that in less than
10 years, the world will be using more

oil than it produces, resulting in scar
cities that will boost the price of U.S.
gasoline to more than $2 a gallon by
1990.
Carter has called the report "deeply
disturbing" and hopes to "convince
the American people of the truth"
about energy shortages.
Although the plan is subject to
last-minute refinements by the White
House, drafts of its kev components
have already been widely circulated

among government agencies and on
Capitol Hill.
Other provisions
The program is likely to include:
—A "standby" gasoline tax of up to
50 cents a gallon that would begin in
1979 if U.S. gasoline consumption
does not decrease.
—A "gas guzzler" tax starting at
$412 for fuel-inefficient automobiles,
ranging possibly as high as $2500 for
the worst offenders, with offsetting re

bates of up to $500 for cars that get the
most miles per gallon.
—New taxes on domestic crude oil
of several dollars a barrel, which
would further drive up gasoline
prices, and new price ceilings for
natural gas which would allow its
price to rise also.
—Tax credits to partially offset the
cost of residential insulation and solar
energy devices and for industrial
fuel-saving measures.

resort to making his appeal directly to
the people—in forums such as his
"fireside chat"—in order to build sup
port.
The biggest battles are certain to be
over proposed new taxes on gasoline
and other petroleum products ex
pected to be in the president's energy
message. Least controversial, key con
gressmen and aides agree, will be con
servation incentives, such as proposed
tax benefits for homeowners who im
prove insulation in their houses or in
stall solar energy devices.
White House aides said that in his
televised address to the nation tonight,
Carter will draw heavily on a new CIA
report which concludes that the world
has far less oil and natural gas in re
serve than has been generally be
lieved.
According to published accounts,
the CIA report claims that in less than
10 years, the world will be using more

oil than it produces, resulting in scar
cities that will boost the price of U.S.
gasoline to more than $2 a gallon by
1990.
Carter has called the report "deeply
disturbing" and hopes to "convince
the American people of the truth"
about energy shortages.
Although the plan is subject to
last-minute refinements by the White
House, drafts of its kev components
have already been widely circulated

among government agencies and on
Capitol Hill.
Other provisions
The program is likely to include:
—A "standby" gasoline tax of up to
50 cents a gallon that would begin in
1979 if U.S. gasoline consumption
does not decrease.
—A "gas guzzler" tax starting at
$412 for fuel-inefficient automobiles,
ranging possibly as high as $2500 for
the worst offenders, with offsetting re

bates of up to $500 for cars that get the
most miles per gallon.
—New taxes on domestic crude oil
of several dollars a barrel, which
would further drive up gasoline
prices, and new price ceilings for
natural gas which would allow its
price to rise also.
—Tax credits to partially offset the
cost of residential insulation and solar
energy devices and for industrial
fuel-saving measures.
Washington (AP) —Congress is em
barking on what may be the fiercest
legislative battle in years as it returns
from its Easter recess to receive Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's complex program
of stiff energy conservation remedies
and new energy taxes.
The president is set to highlight di
mensions of the nation's energy prob
lem in a televised "fireside chat" to the
nation tonight and then to formally
unveil his energy package at a joint
House-Senate session on Wednesday.
Members of Congress who have re
ceived briefings on the energy prog
ram predict Carter's program will
touch off heated debates.
Many elements of the package,
especially those that would cost con
sumers the most in added energy costs,
may never make it through Congress,
or may be substantially modified,
some congressional aides contend.
Appeal to the people
Several congressional leaders have
suggested that the president will have
so much difficulty getting his proposal
through Congress that he may have to
resort to making his appeal directly to
the people—in forums such as his
"fireside chat"—in order to build sup
port.
