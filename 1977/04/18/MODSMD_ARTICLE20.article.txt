# USC proves tough
## Women netters lose two in L.A. 
### Jeff Brandon 
With Coach Anne Hill in the
hospital, All-American Barb
Jordan sidelined with a sore
shoulder and a diving coach as
its chaperone, the Stanford wo
men's tennis team headed for
Los Angeles Thursday to battle
top-ranked USC and UCLA.
The Cards played well under
the circumstances, but not well
enough to win as they bowed,
5-4 to the Bruins and 7-2 to the
Trojans.
The Cards learned a lot over
the weekend despite the losses.
"We really overestimated our
opponents," said Susie Hagey,
who upset AIAW defending
champion Barb Halquist in
Saturday's loss to Southern Cal.
"We're at least as good, if not

better. It's going to be very in
teresting to play them up here in
May."
Friday, with stereos blaring
from a nearby dorm, the Cards
lost a heartbreaker to UCLA.
In the top singles match,
Hagey never gained her concent
ration, losing to Paula Smith,
1-6,1-6. Second seed Diane Mor
rison beat Sue Zaro, 6-1, 6-1.
Bruin Becky Bell beat Nancy
Rudd, 6-2, 6-3.
Cards Nancy Anderson and
Marianne Ingard recorded im
pressive wins, Anderson beating
Kim Neilson, 6-4, 6-2, and In
gard dowing Shannon Gordon,
7-6, 6-3. Stanford's Pat Varga
beat Jenny Geddes, 6-2, 6-4.
Ahead 4-2 after the singles, the
Cards managed to win only one

set in three doubles matches. De
fending national champs Hagey
and Morrison lost in three sets to
Smith-Neilson, 4-6, 6-3,
4-6. Gordon-Bell easily beat
Ingard-Anderson, 3-6, 2-6. The
third doubles team of Rudd-
Varga lost in straight sets, 4-6,
2-6, to Zaro-Geddes.
Saturday, with her parents in
the stand cheering her on, Hagey
did a complete turn around from
the day before and whipped
Halquist, 6-1, 6-3. Returning
serves especially well, Hagey
jumped to a 5-0 lead in the first
set. The sophomore from La Jolla
boasted an improved backhand
to complement her forehand to
pass Halquist several times at
net.
"I was up for the match," said
Hagey, who has never lost to
Halquist. "I was pleased with
the way I played in general, and
especially the way I returned. I
placed my serve very well also."
Playing in front of a
hometown crowd, Morrison lost
a tough three-set match to Sheila
McKinerny, 1-6, 6-1, 5-7. Hagey
and Morrison then teamed to
beat Diane Desfor-Gretchen Gait,
3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
"I'm really pleased with the

way Susie played Saturday," the
bed-ridden Hill said. "Whenever
you beat a national champion
that easily you have to be impre
ssed. Diane had a good weekend
and this is nice. We have to be
tough up top to beat these teams
at the national championships."
Stanford lost five of six dou
bles matches, but Hill didn't ap
pear to be worried.
"The loss of Barb (Jordan)
hurts us more in doubles than in
singles," Hill said. "Barb and Pat
(Varga) are an excellent doubles
team."

Senior Steve Crowley edges (JSC's Lloyd Johnson in the 1500-meter run Saturday on Berkeley's
new Tartan track. Crowley broke the finish tape in 3:51.8. The veteran runner from Palo Alto said
the new surface was "not that fast, but it felt good to run on."
With Coach Anne Hill in the
hospital, All-American Barb
Jordan sidelined with a sore
shoulder and a diving coach as
its chaperone, the Stanford wo
men's tennis team headed for
Los Angeles Thursday to battle
top-ranked USC and UCLA.
The Cards played well under
the circumstances, but not well
enough to win as they bowed,
5-4 to the Bruins and 7-2 to the
Trojans.
The Cards learned a lot over
the weekend despite the losses.
"We really overestimated our
opponents," said Susie Hagey,
who upset AIAW defending
champion Barb Halquist in
Saturday's loss to Southern Cal.
"We're at least as good, if not

better. It's going to be very in
teresting to play them up here in
May."
Friday, with stereos blaring
from a nearby dorm, the Cards
lost a heartbreaker to UCLA.
In the top singles match,
Hagey never gained her concent
ration, losing to Paula Smith,
1-6,1-6. Second seed Diane Mor
rison beat Sue Zaro, 6-1, 6-1.
Bruin Becky Bell beat Nancy
Rudd, 6-2, 6-3.
Cards Nancy Anderson and
Marianne Ingard recorded im
pressive wins, Anderson beating
Kim Neilson, 6-4, 6-2, and In
gard dowing Shannon Gordon,
7-6, 6-3. Stanford's Pat Varga
beat Jenny Geddes, 6-2, 6-4.
Ahead 4-2 after the singles, the
Cards managed to win only one

set in three doubles matches. De
fending national champs Hagey
and Morrison lost in three sets to
Smith-Neilson, 4-6, 6-3,
4-6. Gordon-Bell easily beat
Ingard-Anderson, 3-6, 2-6. The
third doubles team of Rudd-
Varga lost in straight sets, 4-6,
2-6, to Zaro-Geddes.
Saturday, with her parents in
the stand cheering her on, Hagey
did a complete turn around from
the day before and whipped
Halquist, 6-1, 6-3. Returning
serves especially well, Hagey
jumped to a 5-0 lead in the first
set. The sophomore from La Jolla
boasted an improved backhand
to complement her forehand to
pass Halquist several times at
net.
"I was up for the match," said
Hagey, who has never lost to
Halquist. "I was pleased with
the way I played in general, and
especially the way I returned. I
placed my serve very well also."
Playing in front of a
hometown crowd, Morrison lost
a tough three-set match to Sheila
McKinerny, 1-6, 6-1, 5-7. Hagey
and Morrison then teamed to
beat Diane Desfor-Gretchen Gait,
3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
"I'm really pleased with the

way Susie played Saturday," the
bed-ridden Hill said. "Whenever
you beat a national champion
that easily you have to be impre
ssed. Diane had a good weekend
and this is nice. We have to be
tough up top to beat these teams
at the national championships."
Stanford lost five of six dou
bles matches, but Hill didn't ap
pear to be worried.
"The loss of Barb (Jordan)
hurts us more in doubles than in
singles," Hill said. "Barb and Pat
(Varga) are an excellent doubles
team."
