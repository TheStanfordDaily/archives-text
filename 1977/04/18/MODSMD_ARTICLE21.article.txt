# Card nine takes 2 from Cal Bears
## 
### 
Stanford battled its way out of
the Pacific-8 Southern Division
cellar by taking two of three
games from cross-bay rival
California over the weekend,
leaving the Bears in sole owner
ship of last place.
The Cards pounded Cal hur
lers for nine hits and eight runs
Friday while downing Jackie
Jensen's Bears, 8-4, then split a
double-header at Sunken
Diamond Saturday, 4-2 and 3-5.
"Our defense and starting
pitching was excellent," Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess said.
"We didn't hit well Saturday
like we did Friday and I was
pleased we were able to split
with the hitting we had."
Friday the hot-hitting Pepe
Hinojosa led the Cards with
three hits, one a two-run double
in the seventh inning which put
the Cards ahead, 5-0, and pro
vided them with the eventual
winning margin. Including Fri
day's game. Hinojosa had col
lected 21 hits in his last 38 trips
to the plate.
Southpaw John Yandle (7-5)
earned the win with relief from
Bruce Fiala.
Saturday's twin-bill turned
into a walkathon. The Cards
scored three runs in the eighth
inning of the first game on two
infield throwing errors and a
pair of bases on balls.
Winning pitcher Brian Harri
son (7-3) yielded four passes and
fanned eight in eight innings of
mound work. Fiala picked up his
second save of the weekend.
In the final game of the Big

Series, Cal capitalized on six
walks from five Card hurlers to
score three runs in the eighth in
ning. Winning Cal pitcher Mike
Hefferson issued six passes also.
The Cards, 2-7 inthePac-8 and
36-14 on the season, host
league-leading USC for three
games this weekend after warm
ing up withUC-Davis tomorrow.
Marquess said the Cards' of
fense will need to be much more
explosive against the Trojans if
the Cards are to knock over 11-
time NCAA champ USC. Mar
quess noted that it was SC's abil
ity to hit the long ball which en
abled the Trojans to sweep the
Cards in a three-game series last
month.
