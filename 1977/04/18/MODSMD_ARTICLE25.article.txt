# Card cindermen blown off new Berkeley track
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Southern Cal brought only 21 men to its track
meeting with Stanford Saturday in Berkeley, yet it
was the Trojan's depth which buried the Cardi
nals, 106-47.
For instance:
—Tom Andrews, third-place finisher in the
400-meter intermediate hurdles in the 1976 NCAA
championships, sat out of the intermediates
against the Cards The Trojans still swept the Cards
in the one-lap hurdle race; despite Andrews' ab
sence and despite Card Tom Shellworth running a
lifetime best.
—Freshman long jumper Larry Doubley won the
100-meter dash in 10.5. The Trojans have five
other sprinters who have run 10.5 or better already
this season.
—USC returns not one, but two discus throwers
who placed in last year's NCAA meet: Ralph
Fruguglietti and Darrell Elder.
Southern Cal's cornucopia of talent stems from
the Trojan's abundance of scholarships—2l, ac
cording to USC coach Vern Wolfe—and the SC
track tradition rooted in 26 NCAA track and field
team titles.
In addition to winning the 100, Southern Cal
runners won the 200, 400 and 800, both hurdle
races and the two relays.
Andrews brotherj
Stanford sprinters had lost the 400 only once
this season and Jordan sent aces James Lofton and
Alan Sheats to the blocks against Southern Cal's
Andrews brothers, senior Tom and sophomore
Joel. Joel normally runs the 100 and 200, but came
up to challenge the Cards' top one-lap men.
Showing his short-sprint speed, the younger
Andrews jetted to an early lead. Andrews held off
Lofton to win in 46.0, the best time in the confer
ence this year. Lofton finished second with a
lifetimebest 0f46.5 whileSheats ran third in 46.8.
Lofton also finished second in the long jump.
The 6-foot-8 Doubley leaped 26-2V2 to set an Ed
wards Stadium mark and upend Lofton, who
jumped 25-4.
The Cards picked up only one win in the field
events, where the Trojans proved to be as deep as
they are in the short running events.

Only shot putter Terry Albritton bested his Tro-'
jan rivals in the field events as he heaved the put
63-9V2 to break Dallas Long's meet mark of 63-9.
Despite their plethora of talent in the jumps,
weights, hurdles and sprints, the Trojans have re
mained extremely weak in the distance events.
Bill Gail led Stanford to a sweep in the 3000-
meter steeplechase while Cards Jeff Parietti and
Roy Kissin finished one-two in the 5000-meter
run.
But senior Steve Crowley's victorious battle to
the tape with SC's Lloyd Johnson in the 1500
proved the most exciting Stanford win of the after
noon.
Out fast
Crowley took the lead after 200 meters, came
through the first lap in 61 seconds and brought the
field through 800 meters in 2:02.5
"We planned to go out fast early and burn 1
Johnson out," Crowley said. "I waited for (team
mate Mark) Hadley to take the lead during the third
lap. He came up on my shoulder, but didn't pass.
"I knew Johnson has great flat speed as he usu
ally runs the 800. With 200 yards to go, he broke. I
just wanted to stay with him till the straightaway. I
was talkin' to him in the last turn, telling him 'ease
off, ease off.'"
Race excites fans
The Berkeley crowd of 12,500 roared as Crowley
and Johnson turned into the home straightaway,
Johnson with a slight lead.
"The fans were going nuts and I thought, 'Hell, I
can't quit now,"' Crowley said.
With 20 yards to go, Crowley pulled ahead of
Johnson and beat him in the sprint to the tape.
400-meter relay
Stanford also did well in a race it didn't win—
the 400-meter relay. Southern Cal won in 39.9 with
the Cards back at 40.2.
For most of the race Stanford ran even with the
fleet-footed Trojans. The Cards looked sharp.
"It was the best 400 relay we've run this year,"
Jordan said. "The passes were cleaner and we were
stretching out more in the lanes."
In the 1600-meter relay, Lofton ran an impres
sive 45.6 anchor lap, but was unable to overtake
Joel Andrews who started with a 30- to 40-yard
advantage.

Johnson out," Crowley said. "I waited for (team
mate Mark) Hadley to take the lead during the third
lap. He came up on my shoulder, but didn't pass.
"I knew Johnson has great flat speed as he usu
ally runs the 800. With 200 yards to go, he broke. I
just wanted to stay with him till the straightaway. I
was talkin' to him in the last turn, telling him 'ease
off, ease off.'"
Race excites fans
The Berkeley crowd of 12,500 roared as Crowley
and Johnson turned into the home straightaway,
Johnson with a slight lead.
"The fans were going nuts and I thought, 'Hell, I
can't quit now,"' Crowley said.
With 20 yards to go, Crowley pulled ahead of
Johnson and beat him in the sprint to the tape.
400-meter relay
Stanford also did well in a race it didn't win—
the 400-meter relay. Southern Cal won in 39.9 with
the Cards back at 40.2.
For most of the race Stanford ran even with the
fleet-footed Trojans. The Cards looked sharp.
"It was the best 400 relay we've run this year,"
Jordan said. "The passes were cleaner and we were
stretching out more in the lanes."
In the 1600-meter relay, Lofton ran an impres
sive 45.6 anchor lap, but was unable to overtake
Joel Andrews who started with a 30- to 40-yard
advantage.
Southern Cal brought only 21 men to its track
meeting with Stanford Saturday in Berkeley, yet it
was the Trojan's depth which buried the Cardi
nals, 106-47.
For instance:
—Tom Andrews, third-place finisher in the
400-meter intermediate hurdles in the 1976 NCAA
championships, sat out of the intermediates
against the Cards The Trojans still swept the Cards
in the one-lap hurdle race; despite Andrews' ab
sence and despite Card Tom Shellworth running a
lifetime best.
—Freshman long jumper Larry Doubley won the
100-meter dash in 10.5. The Trojans have five
other sprinters who have run 10.5 or better already
this season.
—USC returns not one, but two discus throwers
who placed in last year's NCAA meet: Ralph
Fruguglietti and Darrell Elder.
Southern Cal's cornucopia of talent stems from
the Trojan's abundance of scholarships—2l, ac
cording to USC coach Vern Wolfe—and the SC
track tradition rooted in 26 NCAA track and field
team titles.
In addition to winning the 100, Southern Cal
runners won the 200, 400 and 800, both hurdle
races and the two relays.
Andrews brotherj
Stanford sprinters had lost the 400 only once
this season and Jordan sent aces James Lofton and
Alan Sheats to the blocks against Southern Cal's
Andrews brothers, senior Tom and sophomore
Joel. Joel normally runs the 100 and 200, but came
up to challenge the Cards' top one-lap men.
Showing his short-sprint speed, the younger
Andrews jetted to an early lead. Andrews held off
Lofton to win in 46.0, the best time in the confer
ence this year. Lofton finished second with a
lifetimebest 0f46.5 whileSheats ran third in 46.8.
Lofton also finished second in the long jump.
The 6-foot-8 Doubley leaped 26-2V2 to set an Ed
wards Stadium mark and upend Lofton, who
jumped 25-4.
The Cards picked up only one win in the field
events, where the Trojans proved to be as deep as
they are in the short running events.

Only shot putter Terry Albritton bested his Tro-'
jan rivals in the field events as he heaved the put
63-9V2 to break Dallas Long's meet mark of 63-9.
Despite their plethora of talent in the jumps,
weights, hurdles and sprints, the Trojans have re
mained extremely weak in the distance events.
Bill Gail led Stanford to a sweep in the 3000-
meter steeplechase while Cards Jeff Parietti and
Roy Kissin finished one-two in the 5000-meter
run.
But senior Steve Crowley's victorious battle to
the tape with SC's Lloyd Johnson in the 1500
proved the most exciting Stanford win of the after
noon.
Out fast
Crowley took the lead after 200 meters, came
through the first lap in 61 seconds and brought the
field through 800 meters in 2:02.5
"We planned to go out fast early and burn 1
Johnson out," Crowley said. "I waited for (team
mate Mark) Hadley to take the lead during the third
lap. He came up on my shoulder, but didn't pass.
"I knew Johnson has great flat speed as he usu
