Rabins plan leave of absence
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
toppled from power by a family financial scan
dal, announced yesterday he was taking an
extended leave of absence. Earlier in the day
his wife was fined $26,852 for illegally main
taining U.S. bank accounts.
Rabin, who announced April 7 he was with
drawing as a candidate for re-election, told his
cabinet he would step down Friday and turn
the Israeli government over to Defense Minis
ter Shimon Peres, his successor as leader of the
ruling Labor party.
In Tel Aviv District Court earlier yesterday,
Leah Rabin pleaded guilty to violating Israeli
currency laws. Judge Dov Levine told her he
had spared her a jail term because of the guilty
plea and because he took into account her
"dizzying fall" from grace.
Rabin's political exit and his wife's fine were
the result of disclosures that the couple had
illegally kept two bank accounts with up to
$21,101 in Washington, D.C.
The accounts were opened legally while
Rabin was ambassador to Washington, but
under Israeli law he should have brought the
money back to Israel when he returned in 1973.
As a result of the scandal, Rabin announced
he would not run in national elections next
month. He was fined $1611 last week as cohol
der of the accounts, but his wife, who handled
the family finances, was ordered to stand trial.
Rabin's announcement that he would go on
leave as of Friday had been expected. Attorney
Gen. Aharon Barak ruled last week that Rabin
could not resign outright because he heads a
caretaker government pending new elections.
During his leave, Rabin will remain prime
minister in name and will be formally respon
sible for the functioning of the government.
SST protestors clog airport traffic
New York — A caravan of about 550 cars
crept through Kennedy Airport in protest of
the faster-than-sound Concorde jet yesterday,
and its organizers claimed victory despite fail

ing to clog the place as predicted.
The parade of cars wasn't as big as one last
year, but organizers promised weekly repeats
until the Anglo-French SST is permanently
banned from Kennedy.
The bulk of the protesters arrived in a group
of about 300 cars, horns honking and head
lights turned on. Police quickly routed traffic
to the airport's secondary access roads, keep
ing the main roadway clear for emergencies.
Unlike last year, the cars continued to move
this time at a snail's pace, and no one was
arrested, no cars were towed away and no one
was kept from catching an airplane, police
said. Many travelers were inconvenienced, but
the effects appeared limited to such things as
delays in hailing cabs.
Project cuts to save $120 million
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's
cuts in recommended funding for water pro
jects could save taxpayers an estimated $120
million in fiscal 1978, but that's only a small
fraction of the $55.2 billion budget deficit he
wants to wipe out.
Carter's cuts reflect environmental concerns
as well. The cuts preserve native American
lands, fishing streams and habitats for wildlife
including eagles, falcons and mallard ducks.
But the Council on Environmental Quality
says one project he okayed, the Dolores Dam
and Reservoir in Colorado, will disturb 460
archaeological sites alone.
In all, Carter listed 30 dams, reservoirs and
waterways as likely targets for cuts.
He decided Friday to recommend no fund
ing in fiscal 1978 for 15, partial funding for
five, continued review for two and full funding
for eight. He said he would announce the deci
sions today, but congressional and other
sources made them public over the weekend.
If Congress goes along with the president's
no-funding recommendations, it would save
taxpayers about $109 million in fiscal 1978. If
Congress goes along with Carter's partial
funding recommendations for projects in
Arizona, Utah and North Dakota, it would in

crease savings to somewhat more than $113
million.
Details of his partial-funding recommenda
tions for projects in Louisiana were not availa
ble. But 50 per cent cuts there would push the
savings to $118 million, and larger cuts could
put it at $120 million or more.
That total, however, does not account for
waste on projects that are underway and might
not be completed because of the president's
recommendations. Some $192 million already
has been spent on projects Carter has recom
mended against funding next year.
Handicapped protestors 'hang in'
San Francisco — Some 150 physically dis
advantaged persons "hung in" yesterday in
their 13-day sit-in demonstration to force acti
vation of a measure to promote the rights of the
handicapped.
They have been encamped in the regional
office of the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW) since April 5 to press their
demands.
Some medics are'staying with the de
monstrators, but mostly the handicapped pro
testers pool their abilities to help each other
out.
The protesters took over the regional HEW
office last week, demanding that HEW Secret
ary Joseph Califano sign regulations enforcing
1973 legislation banning discrimination
against the handicapped.
The demonstrators say they'll remain in the
HEW offices indefinitely.
Similar protests in Washington D.C. and Los
Angeles ended after several days.
Tindemans leads Belgian election
Brussels, Belgium — The Christian Socialist
party of Premier Leo Tindemans emerged as
the leader yesterday in first returns from Bel
gium's national elections, the interior ministry
said.
The ministry gave no vote count, but said
projections based on early results from an es

timated six million ballots indicated the Chris
tian Socialists would win 60 of the 212 seats in
the House of Representatives. That would be a
gain of seven over the 1974 election.
The Socialists were expected to pick up one
additional seat to bring their total to 60. The
ministry said no major change was expected
for the Liberals, who previously held 33 seats,
and the Communists, who held four.
Big losers appeared to be the small
language-oriented parties of the Flemish
speaking north and French-speaking south.
The French party, the Rassemblement Wal
loon, was expected to lose seven seats and the
Flemish party two.
Police learn to deal with terrorists
Washington — The government is training
hundreds of police officials from across the
country to use the tactics of waiting and talking
in efforts to free hostages held by terrorists.
The Law Enforcement Assistance Administ
ration (LEAA) said yesterday that more than
600 police commanders and administrators
will be trained this year in hostage negotiation
tactics in 15-day seminars.
LEAA is financing the training at the Illinois
State Police Academy in Springfield with a
grant of $297,000.
Dr. Harvey Schlossberg, a pioneer in the
field of hostage negotiations and a recognized
authority on the subject, is conducting the
training. He is director of psychological ser
vices for the New York City police department.
Acting LEAA Administrator James Gregg
said he hopes the program "will give our coun
try a reserve bank of highly sophisticated
negotiators, able to move in immediately in
crisis situations."
In another recent report, an LEAA
sponsored task force predicted a slight in
crease in incidents in which gunmen capture
hostages and barter their lives for all sorts of
demands. Some cases are acts of political ter
rorism, and others grow out of traditional
crimes such as bank robberies.
The Hanafi Moslem siege of the national

B'nai B'rith headquarters, an Islamic mosque,
and the city hall in Washington was the most
dramatic hostage situation in this country in
recent time.
