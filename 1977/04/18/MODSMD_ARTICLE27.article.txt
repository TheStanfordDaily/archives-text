Correction
In last Friday's story on the rise in housing
costs for co-ops and fraternities, quotes were
incorrected attributed to Randy Barnes.
The quote should have been attributed to
Bob Fisher who is a member of Theta Delta Chi.
The paragraph should have read: Bob Fisher, a
Theta Delt, said the Theta Delts "don't want
any part of residential education" and that he
doesn't "think any other fraternities do either."
Fisher said "Stanford wants to assimilate the
fraternities into the housing system."
Randy Barnes is a Theta Delt, not house
manager for the Delta Kappa Epsilon house as
the story stated.
Patrick Wright, president of Delta Kappa Ep
silon, said the quotes are "not our stand."
