# For Overseas Studies
## Task force proposed 
### Jill Liscom 
A preliminary request for funding a
task force on overseas study here will
be submitted at the ASSU Senate meet
ing tonight by Sen. Tim Ferguson.
According to Ferguson, the purpose
of the task force will be to evaluate
what priority the Overseas Studies
budget should have relative to budgets
of other academic departments here.
The panel will be composed of two
students and seven "distinguished
senior faculty," Ferguson said.
"If we want the faculty to give cre
dence to its findings, we must have a
task force whose members command
respect," he explained in his memo to
the senators.
"I have tried to be careful to get a
balance of supporters and opponents
of the Overseas Studies program,"
Ferguson commented. "There is no
way of telling what type of report the
task force will come up with, but it's
time we had an objective evaluation of
the program relative to other academic
offerings."
So far, faculty members who have
accepted are: William Kays, dean of
engineering; Halsey Royden, dean of

humanities and sciences; Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions; and Paul
Berg, professor of mathematics.
Ferguson said he is looking for a fa
culty member from one of the foreign
language departments and also from
either history or one of the natural sci
ences to serve on the panel. In addi
tion, he said he is "searching dili
gently for a chairperson who is both
widely respected and perceived to be
neutral on the issue."
Ferguson will ask the senate for ten
tative approval of a $300 appropriation
from its discretionary fund to cover
clerical and operational costs of the
task force.
The senate will also be encouraged
to provide input into composition of
the group and what specific areas the
panel should examine, Ferguson said.
The reason for proposing this task
force, Ferguson explained, is that "the
concern of the undergraduates about
the overseas program is second only to
their concern about the tenure and
teaching quality. This is an attempt to
address that concern in a way that will
have impact on decision making at the
University."
