# New paydates for VA benefits may affect 240 students here

The 240 students here who receive
checks from the Veterans Administra
tion (VA) under the G.I. Bill may face a
lean month this summer when the VA
changes its payment procedures, ac
cording to Walter Findeisen, assistant
registrar and recorder.
Effective June 1, monthly checks to
persons enrolled in VA education
programs will be mailed at the begin
ning of the next month rather than the
beginning of the month being covered.
Therefore, Findeisen said, students
enrolled for summer quarter who de
pend on G.I. Bill checks will have to
plan around the lean period from May
1, when they receive their last pre
payment check, to July 1 when they
receive their June payment.
Findeisen said the University has a
"fairly comprehensive financial aid
program, so anybody with a critical
emergency of a financial nature could
probably obtain relief in the form of a
short term loan."
Died in service
G.I. bill benefits go to either veterans
of "dependents of veterans who have
become disabled as a result of service
incurred injury or who have died in

the service," Findeisen said.
"The G.I. Bill helps provide vete
rans' children with the same sort of
opportunities they might have had,
had their parent not been disabled," he
added.
A full-time student receives about
$292 monthly, for up to 45 academic
months, he said, regardless of the
school the student attends.
For the past two years, recipients of
the G.I. Bill were able to receive ad
vance payment checks. When a stu
dent arrived at school in September his
first check, for part of September and
all of October, would be waiting for
him, Findeisen said. He would receive
his next check on Nov. 1, for
November.
Over payments
However, because of overpayments
of $450 million last year, the VA has
decided to send checks at the end of
the month rather than the beginning.

Students last year received checks
they were ineligible for, Because either
they or their school neglected to tell
the VA they weren't enrolled in school
for that month.
Most of overpayments went to stu
dents enrolled in low tuition schools.
There were no overpayments made to
any students here.
"We keep a tight rein on the prog
ram," Findeisen said.
The VA has retained the advance
payment procedure for autumn quar
ter. If a student contacts his school and
requests advance payment, he can
have a check waiting for him when he
arrives at school in the fall.
However, since other checks will
now be mailed at the end of the month,
a student who requested an advance
payment will get a September/October
check in late September, but won't re
ceive a November check until Dec. 1,
Findeisen explained.
