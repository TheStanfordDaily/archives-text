# University reps meet to discuss Bakke brief
## 
### Doug Hyde 
Representatives from Stanford and
three other universities met over the
weekend to discuss filing a statement
with the U.S. Supreme Court on the
Bakke case.
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president here, is due back today from
a meeting with representatives from
Harvard, Columbia and the University
of Pennsylvania.
The statement, if submitted, iyill try
to convey to the court the possible ad
verse effects on admissions programs
if the court upheld the California Sup
reme Court's decision which struck
down as unconstitutional a special
minority admissions program at UC-
Davis Medical School.
In February, at a meeting with 10
students to discuss the Bakke case,
President Richard Lyman agreed that
the University would consider writing
such a statementâ€”known as an
amicus curiae brief. Lyman, however,
did not mention writing the brief in
collaboration with any other schools.
The decision to work with these
other schools came at a meeting two
weeks ago in Philadelphia with groups
concerned about the Bakke case, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs.

At that meeting, which Siena at
tended, the four universities found
they were "thinking along similar
lines" and decided to meet together to
discuss a joint brief, said Rosenzweig.
If, at the meeting, the four univer
sities decided to work together, an out
line wil be worked out, and later, diffe

rent parts of the brief will probably be
assigned to the four schools to be writ
ten, Rosenzweig added.
Rosenzweig also said he felt Siena
would meet with concerned students
after his return to report any progress
on the brief. Siena had promised such
a meeting in February.
