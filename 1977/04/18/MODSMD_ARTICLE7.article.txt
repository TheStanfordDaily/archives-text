# Army, rebels renew skirmishes in Zaire
## 
### 
Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) —Government
troops have launched a counteroffen
sive against Katangan rebels and dri
ven them back 15 miles in a fight for
the copper-mining town of Kolwezi,
the Zaire news agency AZAP said yes
terday.
The report said one wounded pris
oner and quantities of military
supplies were seized in the offensive
that began Saturday night in south
eastern Shaba province, formerly
known as Katanga.
It did not say how many troops were
involved or if any of the 1500 Moroc
can troops sent to aid the government
of President Mobutu Sese Seko joined
in the offensive.
Reporters returning from the area
Saturday night said about 400 Moroc
can soldiers had moved out from Kol
wezi to the village of Kanzenze, 25
miles to the northwest, where Zairean
troops were confronting the rebels.
Weapons recaptured
AZAP's announcement reported
that the Zairean troops had recaptured
some of the weapons they lost when an
estimated 2000 rebels invading from
Marxist-governed Angola overran a
third of Shaba province in an attack
opened March 3.
Western diplomats in Kinshasa were
unable to confirm the government
claims. Last week the Mobutu gov
ernment barred reporters from enter
ing Shaba province and those who
were there are being sent back to
Kinshasa.
In a related development, France
announced its 11 transport planes that
flew in supplies and material for the
Moroccan troops had completed their
mission and returned home. The in
vaders are believed to be led by vete
rans of a rebel army that failed in a bid
to make Shaba province an indepen
dent nation in the 19605. Remnants of
the defeated army retreated into An
gola after the fighting. Most of the in
vaders are believed to be members of
the Lunda tribe, the principal tribe in
the province.
Village clashes
There had been little battle activity
for about two weeks, but last week it
was reported that the rebels had
clashed with government forces at
Kanzenze and at two other villages
farther to the northwest.
In addition to aid from France and
Morocco, Mobutu has received "non
lethal" military support from the Un
ited States and armaments from Bel

gium, Zaire's former colonial ruler.
Mobutu has accused Angola, the
Soviet Union and Cuba of supporting
the invaders, an assertion denied by all
three countries.
The Chinese yesterday renewed
their attack on the Soviets for alleged
involvement in the Zairean conflict.
China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, called the rebels
"Soviet mercenaries."
Noting the Soviet news agency Tass
has described the situation as an inter
nal conflict, the Chinese newspaper
said the Kremlin is hoping "to gloss
over the crimes of Soviet social im
perialism and create pretexts for its
further infringement upon Zaire's in
dependence and sovereignty."
In New York, the Long Island news
paper Newsday reported the CIA is
secretly supporting efforts to recruit
several hundred mercenaries in the
United States and Britain to fight for
the Mobutu government.
Quoting "intelligence sources,"
Newsday said the CIA has strong links
with a California man, David Bufkin,
who the sources said was heading up
the Zaire recruitment effort in the Un
ited States.
Diplomatic sources in Kinshasa
claimed they knew nothing of such re
cruitment and said it would be "politi
cal death" for Mobutu to bring white
mercenaries into the conflict.

can troops sent to aid the government
of President Mobutu Sese Seko joined
in the offensive.
Reporters returning from the area
Saturday night said about 400 Moroc
can soldiers had moved out from Kol
wezi to the village of Kanzenze, 25
miles to the northwest, where Zairean
troops were confronting the rebels.
Weapons recaptured
AZAP's announcement reported
that the Zairean troops had recaptured
some of the weapons they lost when an
estimated 2000 rebels invading from
Marxist-governed Angola overran a
third of Shaba province in an attack
opened March 3.
Western diplomats in Kinshasa were
unable to confirm the government
claims. Last week the Mobutu gov
ernment barred reporters from enter
ing Shaba province and those who
were there are being sent back to
Kinshasa.
In a related development, France
announced its 11 transport planes that
flew in supplies and material for the
Moroccan troops had completed their
mission and returned home. The in
vaders are believed to be led by vete
rans of a rebel army that failed in a bid
to make Shaba province an indepen
dent nation in the 19605. Remnants of
the defeated army retreated into An
gola after the fighting. Most of the in
vaders are believed to be members of
the Lunda tribe, the principal tribe in
the province.
Village clashes
There had been little battle activity
for about two weeks, but last week it
was reported that the rebels had
clashed with government forces at
Kanzenze and at two other villages
farther to the northwest.
In addition to aid from France and
Morocco, Mobutu has received "non
lethal" military support from the Un
ited States and armaments from Bel

gium, Zaire's former colonial ruler.
Mobutu has accused Angola, the
Soviet Union and Cuba of supporting
the invaders, an assertion denied by all
three countries.
The Chinese yesterday renewed
their attack on the Soviets for alleged
involvement in the Zairean conflict.
China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, called the rebels
"Soviet mercenaries."
Noting the Soviet news agency Tass
has described the situation as an inter
nal conflict, the Chinese newspaper
said the Kremlin is hoping "to gloss
over the crimes of Soviet social im
perialism and create pretexts for its
further infringement upon Zaire's in
dependence and sovereignty."
In New York, the Long Island news
paper Newsday reported the CIA is
secretly supporting efforts to recruit
several hundred mercenaries in the
United States and Britain to fight for
the Mobutu government.
Quoting "intelligence sources,"
Newsday said the CIA has strong links
with a California man, David Bufkin,
who the sources said was heading up
the Zaire recruitment effort in the Un
ited States.
Diplomatic sources in Kinshasa
claimed they knew nothing of such re
cruitment and said it would be "politi
cal death" for Mobutu to bring white
mercenaries into the conflict.
Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) —Government
troops have launched a counteroffen
sive against Katangan rebels and dri
ven them back 15 miles in a fight for
the copper-mining town of Kolwezi,
the Zaire news agency AZAP said yes

The report said one wounded pris
oner and quantities of military
supplies were seized in the offensive
that began Saturday night in south
eastern Shaba province, formerly
known as Katanga.
It did not say how many troops were
involved or if any of the 1500 Moroc

of President Mobutu Sese Seko joined
in the offensive.
