Rebuilding the bicycle path along
Palm Drive, the possible completion of
the Campus Drive loop and the possi
ble extension of Lomita Drive to Cam
pus Drive were all projects approved
by the Board of Trustees last Tuesday.
The trustees approved a budget of
$3.6 million for general plant im
provement in 1977-1978. Rebuilding
the bicycle path along the west side of
Palm Drive from the oval to El Camino
will cost $45,000 from this budget and
should be completed during the sum
mer, according to Senior Planner
Oscar Nelson.
The approved budget also set aside
approximately $520,000 for the possi
ble completion of the Campus Drive
loop. The extension would connect
Campus Drive to Junipero Serra and
Los Arboles Road. Los Arboles Road,
which leads down to the golf driving
range, is currently closed off.
When Campus Drive will be ex
tended depends on when Willow Road
will be widened. The widening of Wil
low Road should begin next January or
February, said Jim Nelson, director of
facilities and properties, and will be
called the Sand Hill Road exten
sion. Once traffic reaches a certain
level on the Sand Hill extension, the
University will be required to build the
Campus Drive extension within 18
months, Jim Nelson said.
However, studies indicate that this
level will not be reached for at least 5 to
10 years after the Sand Hill extension
is completed.
The Universiy could build the Cam
pus Drive extension before that time,
but Jim Nelson said it is fair to assume
the Campus Drive building would not
begin until the Sand Hill project is
finished.
The planning office will consider
extending Lomita Drive, said Oscar
Nelson. The new Lomita Drive would
join Campus Drive near the present in
tersection of Campus and Gerona
Road, hundred yards east of the
Campus-Junipero intersection.
Up to $250,000 of the approved
budget could go to this project, includ
ing planning and building of the exten
sion. Once blueprints have been
drawn up, said Oscar Nelson, the deci
sion will be made whether to go ahead
with construction.
