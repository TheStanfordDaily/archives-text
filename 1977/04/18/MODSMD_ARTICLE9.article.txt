## Axe, violence

Axe yeller
Friends on campus have informed
me that the Daily has recently pub
lished a photograph of an awkward
and overweight young man, identified
as me, wearing a funny hat and
struggling to perform what may have
been described as the Axe Yell.
These friends have further informed
me that the article which accompanied
the photograph reported the efforts of
Gary Cavalli to revive the position of
Yell Leader, in a bid to relive the Red-
Hot Days of Yore.
Taken together, the story and photo
graph suggested that red-hottism had
fallen upon sorry times, or at least im
plied that overweight amateurs in
funny hats occasionally attempt to
lead yells, even though ihey lack the
talent and esthetic qualities required
for successful Yell Leadership.
You may be certain that I protest all
such implications.
1 wish to state, for the record, that the
Stanford Marching Band has from time
to time asked me to serve as its band
announcer and to perform allied func
tions. These functions include, with
out limitation, mumbling into mic
rophones, wearing funny hats on the
principal feast days, leading so-called
yells, issuing denials, and explaining
various irregularities to local health
and vice authorities.
The Band has never suggested that
these were particularly useful func
tions or that I was particularly good at
them.
In other words, and as in every other
aspect of its public performance, the
Band lias never intended to give of
fense.
Certain elements of the Band believe
that the Department of Athletics must
recruit suitable yell leaders from out
side the University, and should locate
rugged, sun-tanned beefcake types in
Southern California for this purpose.
Other factions in the Band contend
that yell leading, as a debased and sor
did vestige of the University's
bourgeois past, should be performed
in obscurity by band announcers wear
ing funny hats or by Cavalli wearing
saddle shoes and a dress.
1 hope that this letter has cleared the
air by indicating the range of responsi
ble opinions. I am rather sorry that I
became involved.

Easter violence
I would like to express my sorrow
and dismay over the arson committed
at the Chabad Synagogue in Palo Alto
on Easter, which destroyed many re
ligious books of the Jewish commun
ity.
There has been a long history of the
persecution of Jews by Christians on

Easter, and it is hard to believe tht this
fire was random vandalism. As a
Christian minister, I am ashamed that
such violence is possible in our com
munity.

Public Safety Director Marvin Her
rington dealt with Tuesday's con
frontation in front of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center office door
in exactly such a way as to create con
fusion, incite violence and endanger
the marine recruiter. Herrington at
tacked the situation under the assump
tion that the peaceful demonstrators
were not worth reasoning with.
Standing in the back against the
door, 1 never heard any officer tel I us to
disperse, even though our group had
completely agreed to leave if ordered.
The tactic of trying to quickly push
the marine through demonstrators was
violent and reckless. Thank God that
the demonstrators did not respond to
the police in the same way that they
treated us.

Ass problems
The catastrophe in Death Valley is
not that the National Park Service will
destroy the burros but rather that the
burros are already destroying the na
tional monument.
Brought in and then released by the
early settlers and miners .these ani
mals have overrun the grazing lands
and watering holes of a large part of the
Southwest. Their dominance is a
strong threat to the indigenous flora
and fauna throughout the region.
Though more human methods for
solving the problem can be imagined,
the Park Service is faced with the usual
difficulty of having limited resources
for a given task. An imaginative solu
tion which would protect both the de
sert and the burros would be best.
Under present manpower and budget
ary constraints, no such solution
seems feasible, however. Failure to
take some action now will only make a
bad situation worse.
Studies of the feral burro population
and impact are being conducted in
other public land areas. Grand Canyon
National Park is planning a control
and elimination program to begin
shortly. Hikers there report a signific
ant upsurge in environmental damage
from these animals in just the last
couple years.
