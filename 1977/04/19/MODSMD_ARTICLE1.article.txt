# Vote rests on senior heads, Band
## 
### Chris Wasney 
Students will vote for senior class
officers and on a fee assessment prop
osal for the Band in this week's run-off
election, according to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Randy Bird.
Senior class presidents run-offs are
between the Clark Sterling slate and
the Mike slate.
Senior class officers handle such
duties as choosing the commencement
speaker, purchasing the class gift and
organizing senior activities. Next
year's class budget will be approxi
mately $4000.
Delxipa termed the election essen
tially nonpartisan, saying, "We really
don't have a platform. We're just hav
ing fun running and we hope to get
some creativity into senior activities."
Sterling said, "We've spent so much
time campaigning to show students
how much we'd like to work for them."
The proposed two-quarter fee as
sessment for the Band is on the run-off
ballot rather than the primary ballot
because representatives of the Band
failed to submit the required financial
information to the senate by the April 4
deadline. An emergency session of the
senate placed the Band's assessment
on the run-off ballot.
This mix-up was due to a "lack of
communication between the Band and
the senate," according to Band Man
ager Rich Johnson.
Band members expressed concern
that the proposal would automatically
fail if less than 20 per cent (2219) of
students voted, due to possible lower
voter turn-out in the run-off than in the
primary.
"I'm afraid the chances of the as
sessment passing are not very good,"
said Johnson, "so we're going all out in
our rallies and our leaflets.
"We even have Band members going
door to door to get votes. Some mem
bers have been putting in six to eight
hours a day."
One such rally was held last night
and another is scheduled for Thursday
at noon in White Plaza.
Bird echoed the Band's fears of a
lower voter turnout, saying, "The
turnout will be somewhat lower, due
to the fact that there is no COP run
off."
Sterling, a political science major, is
running with Beverley Standing, an
English major; Pam Strike, a history
major; and Peter Jones, an American
studies major.
DeLapa, a biology major, is running
with Diana Hu, a biology major; Jim
Moroney. an economics major; and
Cathy Person.

Depending on the vote
The Band may be unable to make any trips away from campus next year if
its fee assessment is not approved during Wednesday and Thursday elec
tions. If less than 20 per cent of the student body votes in the election the
Band will automatically lose the assessment.

Depending on the vote
The Band may be unable to make any trips away from campus next year if
its fee assessment is not approved during Wednesday and Thursday elec
tions. If less than 20 per cent of the student body votes in the election the
Band will automatically lose the assessment.
Students will vote for senior class
officers and on a fee assessment prop
osal for the Band in this week's run-off
election, according to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Randy Bird.
Senior class presidents run-offs are
between the Clark Sterling slate and
the Mike slate.
Senior class officers handle such
duties as choosing the commencement
speaker, purchasing the class gift and
organizing senior activities. Next
year's class budget will be approxi
mately $4000.
Delxipa termed the election essen
tially nonpartisan, saying, "We really
don't have a platform. We're just hav
ing fun running and we hope to get
some creativity into senior activities."
Sterling said, "We've spent so much
time campaigning to show students
how much we'd like to work for them."
The proposed two-quarter fee as
sessment for the Band is on the run-off
ballot rather than the primary ballot
because representatives of the Band
failed to submit the required financial
information to the senate by the April 4
deadline. An emergency session of the
senate placed the Band's assessment
on the run-off ballot.
This mix-up was due to a "lack of
communication between the Band and
the senate," according to Band Man
ager Rich Johnson.
Band members expressed concern
that the proposal would automatically
fail if less than 20 per cent (2219) of
students voted, due to possible lower
voter turn-out in the run-off than in the
primary.
"I'm afraid the chances of the as
sessment passing are not very good,"
said Johnson, "so we're going all out in
our rallies and our leaflets.
"We even have Band members going
door to door to get votes. Some mem
bers have been putting in six to eight
hours a day."
One such rally was held last night
and another is scheduled for Thursday
at noon in White Plaza.
Bird echoed the Band's fears of a
lower voter turnout, saying, "The
turnout will be somewhat lower, due
to the fact that there is no COP run
off."
Sterling, a political science major, is
running with Beverley Standing, an
English major; Pam Strike, a history
major; and Peter Jones, an American
studies major.
