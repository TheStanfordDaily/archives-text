# Familiar position on minority offices
##

Henry Organ

President Richard Lyman's com
ments in the April 6 issue of Campus
Report regarding the office of assistant
to the president for chicano affairs are
familiar. Thgy essentially duplicate
positions given by the administration
to members of the black community
here about three years ago when they
sought continuation of a parallel of
fice, the office of assistant to the presi
dent for black affairs, after it was vac
ated by James Simmons.
The rationale offered by the ad
ministration is as wrong now on
chicano affairs as it was then on black
affairs.
First, it was clear to most everyone
in the black community that the estab
lishment of the office was not to be in

perpetuity. It was obvious that the
University wanted someone to resolve
the many problems raised at the time
by the black community here and na
tionally.
A fallacy in the administration's
thinking is that it believes that such
offices should continue only until
such time as "the functions of the of
fice are being performed elsewhere." It
may be that some functions pertaining
to race cannot be effectively and exclu
sively performed in a particular de
partment.
It is conceivable that issues and
problems of race may not be suitable
for, or compatible with, the typical
university organizational structure.
Generally this is why new depart
ments and positions are created in or

ganizations.
In concluding this point, I am of the
opinion that the office of black affairs
was closed before the functions of that
office were performed elsewhere.
Second, as to the "drawbacks" of
such offices, the office of black affairs
was never proposed or operated as "a
substitute for everything else." Rather,
it usually provided guidance and as
sistance to schools and departments,
and in many instances, I understand,
this assistance was solicited and in
most cases it was welcomed.
Third, the office was incorrectly
perceived as solely crisis-oriented. It
was frequently used during the latter
stages of its prematurely terminated
existence as a positive force. There
were a number of beneficial functions
that office performed, and it could
have performed more if continued.
But the University's decision to dis
solve the office said, in effect, "We
thank you Jim, for coming to put out
the fires at Stanford, and now that they
have subsided, we can terminate your
office. There's nothing positive it can
perform for us now."
I should anticipate the University's
response by stating that Simmons re
commended, upon resigning, that the
office be dissolved. I am of the opinion

that the administration was in error to
act on the recommendation of one in
dividual, when a larger number of
people had called for the establish
ment of the office in the first place.
As the only holder of that office,
however, the administration was
clever to seize the opportunity pro
vided by the uniqueness of the re
commender, and the recommendation
he offered. It was indeed an easy way
out for the administration.
Last, the University should not find
it "difficult to recruit someone whose
task would be to phase the office out of
existence." Organizations frequently
bring individuals and firms in, and es
tablish offices, for a finite period of
time to study problems, develop, and
in some cases, implement recommen
dations.
Such was inherent in the office of
black affairs and most members of the
black community knew that.
In summary, the black community
has not reached a point in time in
which it has full rights, privileges and
opportunities at Stanford. With an of
fice of black affairs, maybe in 2077
A.D.; without it, probably never.

commended, upon resigning, that the
office be dissolved. I am of the opinion

that the administration was in error to
act on the recommendation of one in
dividual, when a larger number of
people had called for the establish
ment of the office in the first place.
As the only holder of that office,
however, the administration was
clever to seize the opportunity pro
vided by the uniqueness of the re
commender, and the recommendation
he offered. It was indeed an easy way
out for the administration.
Last, the University should not find
it "difficult to recruit someone whose
task would be to phase the office out of
existence." Organizations frequently
bring individuals and firms in, and es
tablish offices, for a finite period of
time to study problems, develop, and
in some cases, implement recommen
dations.
Such was inherent in the office of
black affairs and most members of the
black community knew that.
In summary, the black community
has not reached a point in time in
which it has full rights, privileges and
opportunities at Stanford. With an of
fice of black affairs, maybe in 2077
A.D.; without it, probably never.

President Richard Lyman's com
ments in the April 6 issue of Campus
Report regarding the office of assistant
to the president for chicano affairs are
familiar. Thgy essentially duplicate
positions given by the administration
to members of the black community
here about three years ago when they
sought continuation of a parallel of
fice, the office of assistant to the presi
dent for black affairs, after it was vac
ated by James Simmons.
The rationale offered by the ad
ministration is as wrong now on
chicano affairs as it was then on black
affairs.
First, it was clear to most everyone
in the black community that the estab
lishment of the office was not to be in

perpetuity. It was obvious that the
University wanted someone to resolve
the many problems raised at the time
by the black community here and na
tionally.
A fallacy in the administration's
thinking is that it believes that such
offices should continue only until
such time as "the functions of the of
fice are being performed elsewhere." It
may be that some functions pertaining
to race cannot be effectively and exclu
sively performed in a particular de
partment.
It is conceivable that issues and
problems of race may not be suitable
for, or compatible with, the typical
university organizational structure.
Generally this is why new depart
ments and positions are created in or

ganizations.
In concluding this point, I am of the
opinion that the office of black affairs
was closed before the functions of that
office were performed elsewhere.
Second, as to the "drawbacks" of
such offices, the office of black affairs
was never proposed or operated as "a
substitute for everything else." Rather,
it usually provided guidance and as
sistance to schools and departments,
and in many instances, I understand,
this assistance was solicited and in
most cases it was welcomed.
Third, the office was incorrectly
perceived as solely crisis-oriented. It
was frequently used during the latter
stages of its prematurely terminated
existence as a positive force. There
were a number of beneficial functions
that office performed, and it could
have performed more if continued.
But the University's decision to dis
solve the office said, in effect, "We
thank you Jim, for coming to put out
the fires at Stanford, and now that they
have subsided, we can terminate your
office. There's nothing positive it can
perform for us now."
I should anticipate the University's
response by stating that Simmons re
commended, upon resigning, that the
office be dissolved. I am of the opinion

that the administration was in error to
act on the recommendation of one in
dividual, when a larger number of
people had called for the establish
ment of the office in the first place.
