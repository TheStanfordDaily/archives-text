# 'Fiddler' comes to life-I'chaim!

A fiddler on the roof.
Sounds crcizy, no? But in our
little village of Anatevka, you
might say every one of us is a
fiddler on the roof, trying to
scratch out a pleasant, simple
tune vvilhoul breaking his
neck.
—Tevye, the milkman, from
Fiddler on the Hoof
In long, colorful cotton
skirts and shawls, in tattered
knickers and ill-fitting vests,
wearing kerchiefs, caps and
yarrnulkahs, they climb on
stage, smiling and eager to
work. The lights dim, the
chattering chorus readies it
self and seconds later begins
belting out "America, the
Beautiful" as a blue spot light
bounces behind them, 'iivit
ing scattered bemused obser
vers to sing along.
"America, the beautiful"?
Sounds crazy, no?
These days, it's not so
crazy. For this particular
chorus on this particular
April afternoon, the "pleas
ant, simple tune" being
scratched out is merely a
vocal warm-up for a run
through of Ramshead's 1977
musical. Fiddler on the Hoof.
Opening tomorrow night in
Memorial Auditorium, the
show has been in production
since January, but has been in
the minds of the production
staff, composed entirely of
students, since last May,
when the staff for this year's
show was selected.
Only choice
"Sammy (musical director
Sam Spigelman) and I didn't
want to do any other show,"
says Paul Edwards, director
of the production.
Whereas most musicals are
solely out to entertain, Paul is
sure Fiddler has something
more important to say. "It's

one of the few musicals that
has a storyline that can move
an audience," he says.
Indeed, the story of Tevye,
the haggard but humorous
Jewish milkman with five
troublesome daughters to
marry off, a wife who nags
him from dawn till dusk, an
ailing horse and Russians on
his back, makes for moving
drama as well as splendid
musical entertainment. Set in
turn-of-the-century Czarist
Russia about 40 miles outside
of modern-day Kiev, it paints
an earthy picture of life in the
tiny shtetl (small Jewish
community) of Anatevka, the
prototypical Eastern Euro
pean village where most of
today's American Jews have
their roots.
Originally produced on
Broadway in 1964 with Zero
Mostel as Tevye, the show is a
composite of Sholom
Aleichem stories that was
made into a book by Joseph
Stein. Aleichem, whose real
name was Solomon
Rabinowitz, wrote most of his
stories between 1895 and
1916, and the character of
Teyve appeared in all of
them.
To be a jew
And how were director
Edwards, a Catholic, and as
sistant director Simon San
chez able to project to their
mostly non-Jewish 48-
member cast what it was like
to be a persecuted Jew, to
have virtually a portable re
ligion, something so static, so
stable and rich with tradition,
so all-encompassing and un
changing that it could be (as it
had to be) taken intact where
ver one was forced to move?
They did their homework on
the subject.
"1 read up on the world of
Sholom Aleichem," says
Paul. "I started talking to
people, to Rabbi MarkCartun,

(English Prof.) Larry Fried
lander. And a couple of his
tory books are always helpful,
especially when dealing with
pogroms."
Pogroms usually entailed
varying degrees of brutality
on the part of the local Rus
sian police establishment, a
kind of "violence for the mas
ses that didn't do a lot for the
Jewish population," says
Paul. "Jews were placed

within special restricted
areas in the village; they
couldn't farm, they couldn't
own land. They were quite
heavily persecuted."
Tevye is forever being con
fronted with an invader from
the world outside, the mons
ter of change; he hears over
and over that "times are
changing." Finding it frus
trating to cope with and pain

ful to accept, it is only his
sense of humor and his one
sided dialogues with God that
enable him to face the future,
to depend on the rock of his
faith to see him through.
Original choreography
Through her original
dances, choreographer Ann
Malmuth-onn, a senior in an
thropology who spent t he last
three years in Israel and has
danced professionally, has

deftly exposed the soul ot
each character and has. with
movement, managed to con
vey how man's spiritual side
was incorporated into every
activity, no matter how tri
vial. In these cramped and
dismal ghettoes, "there was
no horizontal movement be
cause they didn't have
space," says Ann. "They
planted their feet on the floor,
but reached to the sky with
their arms."
But there is more behind
these movements than is at
first apparent. "The idea here
is man, very bound to the
earth, tries to approach God.
But man is human first of all.
He's weak and he's vulnera
ble and he yearns to God to
transcend his mundane exis
tence," she says.
Again, the primarily non-
Jewish cast posed no serious
problems. "The main hard
ship to overcome in teaching
the dances is not the technical
steps but the ecstasy of the
movement, the spirit and the
feeling that goes into it that
makes each movement so in
tense," says Ann.
She is amazed at how far
the cast has come in the past
few months. "Their en
thusiasm carried them
through," she says. "They are
a special group of people."
Staging the show
Another group of "special
people" is concerned with
the mechanics of actually
staging the show. For pro

ducer Doug Bedard and assis
tant producer Andy Paul,
both seniors, this has meant
many late nights wrestling
with miles of red tape.
"The basic job of the pro
ducer is to take care of the
business side of a show so the
director can take care of the
artistic side," says Doug.
This includes everything
from dealing with royalties,
plant services, public events
and the drama department
(for the use of facilities) to
"driving to San Mateo to pick
up 50 folding chairs," says
Doug. "Actors have it easy."
"The pressures do get
pretty intense at times," says
Andy. But Doug has an ap
propriate analogy: "It's com
parable to Jewish mother
hood; you suffer in silence,"
he says.
As Andy explains what
happened recently when he
talked to his family, the un
ique problem of all members
of the technical crew, the
stage crew, the costume crew,
make-up crew, etc. becomes
distressingly apparent. When
he invited his parents up to
see the show, they said,
"Why? You aren't in it."
"It's a vicarious experi
ence," suggests Doug, "se
eing what you have done up
there on the stage work by it
self, an knowing that no one
in the 1700-seat theater
knows how much you've
done for it..."
