## ballet/julianne koehne S.F. Ballet scores entertaining success-in its own style 
### 
Two classical radio stations
have been advertising the San
Francisco Ballet by telling us
that no, we haven't been dream
ing, that the company really is
looking like a big-time East
Coast company. I think that's a
naive hope which fortunately is
not true.
Imitation in any artistic en
deavor is a sell-out which con
descends to its audience and
though the San Francisco com
pany's technical standards ap
proach a par with a New York
company, trashy copy-catting is

not what they are about. Stylisti
cally and emotionally, they per
form in a different way than any
other company; they are more
frank and open yet still purely
classical. Also, the artistic direc
tion of the company never stoops
to offer a piece that offends our
taste and sensibilities by assum
ing we cannot handle that which
is unobtrusive in its artistic mes
sage.
In any case, the greatest
choreographers in New York,
like Balanchine or Robbins, have
created an indigenous style

peculiar to New York, while
many of ABT's choreographers
are European. I'd say that the San
Francisco Ballet Compnay looks
superb because it has developed
its own style; it draws on, but
does not imitate directly, its New
York heritage.
Auto-choreography
Their program last Saturday
night was an opportunity to see
the company performing their
own choreographers' works.
Beethoven Quintets and Mobile
were choreographed by mem
bers of the company, John
McFall and Tomm Ruud, respec
tively. The company's co
director, Michael Smuin,
choreographed Medea and the
company's ballet master, Robert
Gladstein, choreographed Ger
shwin. Of the four, only Mobile
was not a world premiere.
Unfortunately, I came in dur
ing the middle of Beethoven
Quintets, in time to see the three
pas de deux to the adagio from
Op. 59, No. 3. The dancers wear
leotards and tights with simple
gauze skirts and blouses and per
form classical combinations of
steps interspersed with courtly
motifs. The first two dancers roll

their forearms and point one foot
and bow to each other; the sec
ond two move their arms in cir
cular patters as they turn with
one leg pointed to the side, held
very low. To contrast and to
connect ballet's origins with its
present, the third pas de deux
begins with the woman bound
ing in from the left in a high
jump and both the man and
woman jump vigorously and ex
tend their legs in split kicks.
What's refreshing about
McFall's choreography is that,
though it is simplistic, it does
not imitate Balanchine's particu
lar blend of neoclassicism and
courtly dancing, as so many
other choreographers have at
tempted to do. Instead, McFall
uses a purer, more classical ap
proach, keeps the remnants of
courtly dancing minimal, and
does not use secondhand in
nuendos and idiosyncrasies
from similar works in New York
City Ballet's repertoire.
Acronym
Mobile (1969) is a simple ac
ronym for an absurd space-age
title—Moving Objects Behaving
in Linear Equipoise. The dance
itself is not as self-consciously

contrived as the title. Damara
Bennett, Tom Ruud, and De
borah Zdobinski begin in a
locked position in which one
woman straddles the man's
waist in a right angle and the
other woman lies horizontally
on top of them. The dance breaks
down to the process of move
ment itself and stretches our
own sense of time; the dancers
slowly move only from kneeling
to standing or on one leg while
moving the other leg.
Medea's choreographer,
Michael Smuin, says in the prog
ram notes that, "A shopkeeper
on the Greek island of Mykonos
once told me, 'Inside every
Greek woman is a little Medea.
A dry-cleaner in Toluca,
Mexico once told me that every
man is a Don Juan, but I still
think that Don Juan and Medea
make interesting, dramatic pre
texts for theater and that is how
Medea should (and does) suc
ceed: as a theatrical piece of
dance-drama and not as an over
blown pseudo-commentary or a
caricature. All the cast members
take their roles personally and
seriously, perhaps because
Smuin is particularly attentive

to each dancer's individual ta
lents. Long-limbed Laurie Cow
den as Creusa is superb; her part
is almost entirely dancing and at
times her movements are so fine
and intricate and rapid that she
looks like a skittering spider.
Vicious flame
Anita Paciotti's role as Medea
is mostly acting; her most effec
tive scene comes when the sons
of Jason (Dennis Marshall) and
Medea (the sons are played by
Gardner Carlson and David
McNaughton) trap Creusa in a
net of ropes. Paciotti enters from
the right in a deep knee bend; her
torso almost touches the floor
and her knees are at an angle of
180 degrees and face the side.
She gestures emphatically and
repeats the same open bend fac
ing the audience. Through her
thighs we see the dead Creusa;
Medea looks as though she has
excreted a vile egg. And when
she crosses her legs tightly,
the line of her crimson legs flow
ing into her crimson hips makes
her look like a vicious flame.
Gershwin is a suite of dances
in eight sections which responds
to the music, though not the
lyrics, of Porgy and Bess, A

Symphonic Picture. Robert
Gladstein, the choreographer,
danced with the San Francisco
Ballet and American Ballet The
ater and is not ballet master for
the company. David Guthrie de
signed for Broadway and ABT
before he did Gershwin; the
brown shades of his costumes
and the scenery derive from his
sense of "the sophisticated ear
thiness of Gershwin's score."
Constantly shifting nebuli of
woman dancers in soft slippers
and gauzy brown dresses began
the ballet with lyrical, down
ward arm movements to the
music of "Summertime."
Laurie Cowden and Tina
Santos move marvelously as the
mood shifts from melancholy to
exuberant jazz with shoulder
shrugs and hipping, but never did
they deliberately attempt to make
the audience laugh by making fun
of themselves or the steps.
For this reason, Gershwin's
campiness doesn't pull the dan
cers and the company down.
And this sincerity of intent is
something those big time East
Coast companies like ABT and
the Joffrey sometimes don't
have.

Gardner Carlson and David
McNaughton) trap Creusa in a
net of ropes. Paciotti enters from
the right in a deep knee bend; her
torso almost touches the floor
and her knees are at an angle of
180 degrees and face the side.
She gestures emphatically and
repeats the same open bend fac
ing the audience. Through her
thighs we see the dead Creusa;
Medea looks as though she has
excreted a vile egg. And when
she crosses her legs tightly,
the line of her crimson legs flow
ing into her crimson hips makes
her look like a vicious flame.
Gershwin is a suite of dances
in eight sections which responds
to the music, though not the
lyrics, of Porgy and Bess, A

Symphonic Picture. Robert
Gladstein, the choreographer,
danced with the San Francisco
Ballet and American Ballet The
ater and is not ballet master for
the company. David Guthrie de
signed for Broadway and ABT
before he did Gershwin; the
brown shades of his costumes
and the scenery derive from his
sense of "the sophisticated ear
thiness of Gershwin's score."
Constantly shifting nebuli of
woman dancers in soft slippers
and gauzy brown dresses began
the ballet with lyrical, down
ward arm movements to the
music of "Summertime."
Laurie Cowden and Tina
Santos move marvelously as the
mood shifts from melancholy to
exuberant jazz with shoulder
shrugs and hipping, but never did
they deliberately attempt to make
the audience laugh by making fun
of themselves or the steps.
For this reason, Gershwin's
campiness doesn't pull the dan
cers and the company down.
And this sincerity of intent is
something those big time East
Coast companies like ABT and
the Joffrey sometimes don't
have.
Two classical radio stations
have been advertising the San
Francisco Ballet by telling us
that no, we haven't been dream
ing, that the company really is
looking like a big-time East
Coast company. I think that's a
naive hope which fortunately is
not true.
Imitation in any artistic en
deavor is a sell-out which con
descends to its audience and
though the San Francisco com
pany's technical standards ap
proach a par with a New York
company, trashy copy-catting is

not what they are about. Stylisti
cally and emotionally, they per
form in a different way than any
other company; they are more
frank and open yet still purely
classical. Also, the artistic direc
tion of the company never stoops
to offer a piece that offends our
taste and sensibilities by assum
ing we cannot handle that which
is unobtrusive in its artistic mes
sage.
In any case, the greatest
choreographers in New York,
like Balanchine or Robbins, have
created an indigenous style

peculiar to New York, while
many of ABT's choreographers
are European. I'd say that the San
Francisco Ballet Compnay looks
superb because it has developed
its own style; it draws on, but
does not imitate directly, its New
York heritage.
Auto-choreography
Their program last Saturday
night was an opportunity to see
the company performing their
own choreographers' works.
Beethoven Quintets and Mobile
were choreographed by mem
bers of the company, John
McFall and Tomm Ruud, respec
tively. The company's co
director, Michael Smuin,
choreographed Medea and the
company's ballet master, Robert
Gladstein, choreographed Ger
shwin. Of the four, only Mobile
was not a world premiere.
Unfortunately, I came in dur
ing the middle of Beethoven
Quintets, in time to see the three
pas de deux to the adagio from
Op. 59, No. 3. The dancers wear
leotards and tights with simple
gauze skirts and blouses and per
form classical combinations of
steps interspersed with courtly
motifs. The first two dancers roll

their forearms and point one foot
and bow to each other; the sec
ond two move their arms in cir
cular patters as they turn with
one leg pointed to the side, held
very low. To contrast and to
connect ballet's origins with its
present, the third pas de deux
begins with the woman bound
ing in from the left in a high
jump and both the man and
woman jump vigorously and ex
tend their legs in split kicks.
What's refreshing about
McFall's choreography is that,
though it is simplistic, it does
not imitate Balanchine's particu
lar blend of neoclassicism and
courtly dancing, as so many
other choreographers have at
tempted to do. Instead, McFall
uses a purer, more classical ap
proach, keeps the remnants of
courtly dancing minimal, and
does not use secondhand in
nuendos and idiosyncrasies
from similar works in New York
City Ballet's repertoire.
Acronym
Mobile (1969) is a simple ac
ronym for an absurd space-age
title—Moving Objects Behaving
in Linear Equipoise. The dance
itself is not as self-consciously

contrived as the title. Damara
Bennett, Tom Ruud, and De
borah Zdobinski begin in a
locked position in which one
woman straddles the man's
waist in a right angle and the
other woman lies horizontally
on top of them. The dance breaks
down to the process of move
ment itself and stretches our
own sense of time; the dancers
slowly move only from kneeling
to standing or on one leg while
moving the other leg.
Medea's choreographer,
Michael Smuin, says in the prog
ram notes that, "A shopkeeper
on the Greek island of Mykonos
once told me, 'Inside every
Greek woman is a little Medea.
A dry-cleaner in Toluca,
Mexico once told me that every
man is a Don Juan, but I still
think that Don Juan and Medea
make interesting, dramatic pre
texts for theater and that is how
Medea should (and does) suc
ceed: as a theatrical piece of
dance-drama and not as an over
blown pseudo-commentary or a
caricature. All the cast members
take their roles personally and
seriously, perhaps because
Smuin is particularly attentive

to each dancer's individual ta
lents. Long-limbed Laurie Cow
den as Creusa is superb; her part
is almost entirely dancing and at
times her movements are so fine
and intricate and rapid that she
looks like a skittering spider.
Vicious flame
Anita Paciotti's role as Medea
is mostly acting; her most effec
tive scene comes when the sons
of Jason (Dennis Marshall) and
Medea (the sons are played by
Gardner Carlson and David
McNaughton) trap Creusa in a
net of ropes. Paciotti enters from
the right in a deep knee bend; her

ronym for an absurd space-age
title—Moving Objects Behaving
in Linear Equipoise. The dance
itself is not as self-consciously

contrived as the title. Damara
Bennett, Tom Ruud, and De
borah Zdobinski begin in a
locked position in which one
woman straddles the man's
waist in a right angle and the
other woman lies horizontally
on top of them. The dance breaks
down to the process of move
ment itself and stretches our
own sense of time; the dancers
slowly move only from kneeling
to standing or on one leg while
moving the other leg.
Medea's choreographer,
Michael Smuin, says in the prog
ram notes that, "A shopkeeper
on the Greek island of Mykonos
once told me, 'Inside every
Greek woman is a little Medea.
A dry-cleaner in Toluca,
Mexico once told me that every
man is a Don Juan, but I still
think that Don Juan and Medea
make interesting, dramatic pre
texts for theater and that is how
Medea should (and does) suc
ceed: as a theatrical piece of
dance-drama and not as an over
blown pseudo-commentary or a
caricature. All the cast members
take their roles personally and
seriously, perhaps because
Smuin is particularly attentive

to each dancer's individual ta
lents. Long-limbed Laurie Cow
den as Creusa is superb; her part
is almost entirely dancing and at
times her movements are so fine
and intricate and rapid that she
looks like a skittering spider.
Vicious flame
Anita Paciotti's role as Medea
is mostly acting; her most effec
tive scene comes when the sons
of Jason (Dennis Marshall) and
Medea (the sons are played by
Gardner Carlson and David
McNaughton) trap Creusa in a
net of ropes. Paciotti enters from
the right in a deep knee bend; her
torso almost touches the floor
and her knees are at an angle of
180 degrees and face the side.
She gestures emphatically and
repeats the same open bend fac
ing the audience. Through her
thighs we see the dead Creusa;
Medea looks as though she has
excreted a vile egg. And when
she crosses her legs tightly,
the line of her crimson legs flow
ing into her crimson hips makes
her look like a vicious flame.
Gershwin is a suite of dances
in eight sections which responds
to the music, though not the
lyrics, of Porgy and Bess, A

Symphonic Picture. Robert
Gladstein, the choreographer,
danced with the San Francisco
Ballet and American Ballet The
ater and is not ballet master for
the company. David Guthrie de
signed for Broadway and ABT
before he did Gershwin; the
brown shades of his costumes
and the scenery derive from his
sense of "the sophisticated ear
thiness of Gershwin's score."
Constantly shifting nebuli of
woman dancers in soft slippers
and gauzy brown dresses began
the ballet with lyrical, down
ward arm movements to the
music of "Summertime."
Laurie Cowden and Tina
Santos move marvelously as the
mood shifts from melancholy to
exuberant jazz with shoulder
shrugs and hipping, but never did
they deliberately attempt to make
the audience laugh by making fun
of themselves or the steps.
For this reason, Gershwin's
campiness doesn't pull the dan
cers and the company down.
And this sincerity of intent is
something those big time East
Coast companies like ABT and
the Joffrey sometimes don't
have.
Two classical radio stations
have been advertising the San
Francisco Ballet by telling us
that no, we haven't been dream
ing, that the company really is
looking like a big-time East
Coast company. I think that's a
naive hope which fortunately is
not true.
Imitation in any artistic en
deavor is a sell-out which con
descends to its audience and
though the San Francisco com
pany's technical standards ap
proach a par with a New York
company, trashy copy-catting is

not what they are about. Stylisti
cally and emotionally, they per
form in a different way than any
other company; they are more
frank and open yet still purely
classical. Also, the artistic direc
tion of the company never stoops
to offer a piece that offends our
taste and sensibilities by assum
ing we cannot handle that which
is unobtrusive in its artistic mes
sage.
In any case, the greatest
choreographers in New York,
like Balanchine or Robbins, have
created an indigenous style

peculiar to New York, while
many of ABT's choreographers
are European. I'd say that the San
Francisco Ballet Compnay looks
superb because it has developed
its own style; it draws on, but
does not imitate directly, its New
York heritage.
Auto-choreography
Their program last Saturday
night was an opportunity to see
the company performing their
own choreographers' works.
Beethoven Quintets and Mobile
were choreographed by mem
bers of the company, John
McFall and Tomm Ruud, respec
tively. The company's co
director, Michael Smuin,
choreographed Medea and the
company's ballet master, Robert
Gladstein, choreographed Ger
shwin. Of the four, only Mobile
was not a world premiere.
Unfortunately, I came in dur
ing the middle of Beethoven
Quintets, in time to see the three
pas de deux to the adagio from
Op. 59, No. 3. The dancers wear
leotards and tights with simple
gauze skirts and blouses and per
form classical combinations of
steps interspersed with courtly
motifs. The first two dancers roll

their forearms and point one foot
and bow to each other; the sec
ond two move their arms in cir
cular patters as they turn with
one leg pointed to the side, held
very low. To contrast and to
connect ballet's origins with its
present, the third pas de deux
begins with the woman bound
ing in from the left in a high
jump and both the man and
woman jump vigorously and ex
tend their legs in split kicks.
What's refreshing about
McFall's choreography is that,
though it is simplistic, it does
not imitate Balanchine's particu
lar blend of neoclassicism and
courtly dancing, as so many
other choreographers have at
tempted to do. Instead, McFall
uses a purer, more classical ap
proach, keeps the remnants of
courtly dancing minimal, and
does not use secondhand in
nuendos and idiosyncrasies
from similar works in New York
City Ballet's repertoire.
