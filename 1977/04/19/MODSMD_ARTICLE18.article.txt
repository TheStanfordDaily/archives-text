## Arlo Guthrie creates his own image at Berkeley 
### 
It's not easy to be the son of a
legend. Yet this is something
Arlo Guthrie has had to contend
with all his professional life. In
light of the recent widespread
interest in Woody Guthrie, stir
red up by the movie Bound For
Glory, Arlo's concert last week at
the Berkeley Community Thea
ter showed how far he has come
in forging his own identity.
You were probably introduced
to Arlo Guthrie as the innocent,
scruffy chronicler of the "Alice's
Restaurant Massacre": the
stoned-out Will Rogers of the
'60s. And this is one of the sides
that Arlo presented in the con
cert to the delight of the Berkeley
audience. Accompanying him
self on the piano, he opened with
a long, rambling, monologue/
song giving his version of the
exodus from Egypt. According
to Guthrie, the fleeing Israelites
found that the pharaoh had
sabotaged them by replacing the
sandwiches, hot sauce and Pep
sis in their knapsacks with
marijuana. The plan was to bust
them for transporting dope ac
ross the Egyptian state line.
Guthrie was joined at the end
of the monologue by his five
piece band, Shenandoah, a ver
satile, well-rehearsed folk
country band. They had the per
sonality to stand alone, perform
ing a number of well-received

songs, and their presence
strengthened Guthrie's mo
ments in the spot. With the fine
instrumental and vocal backing
provided by Shenandoah, Gut
hrie seems to have found the
freedom and the foundation that
his songs have needed.
Bite
A good example of this was
the upbeat, rock version of his
standard, "Coming Into Los
Angeles," the most compelling
rendition of that song to date.
The two lead guitarists, on top of
the driving beat, gave the song
the power and bite that it needed
without crowding Guthrie and

the lyrics off the stage. This was
also true in the Rolling Stones'
"Connection" and the Beatle's
"I've Just Seen a Face," popular
songs whose familiarity was en
livened by Guthrie's arrange
ments.
The rest of the show, includ
ing Guthrie's protest songs.—
both his own and his father's—
also benefited from the versatil
ity and security Shenandoah
provided.
Dressed in denim, his eyes
closed, his expression and clear
voice serious, Guthrie per
formed such songs as "Pretty
Boy Floyd," "This Land is Your

Land" and "Buffalo Skinners" in
a dramatic manner that brought
the audience to a hush. Al
though Arlo has created his own
distinctive personality, he
shows pride in his father's le
gacy by including Woody's
songs in the act.
Clams
One of the highlights of the
concert was another
monologue/song about the ter
rors faced by the early American
settlers in the form of "giant
humongous clams." According
to Guthrie, these man-eating
bivalves grew feet and chased
puritans across the Mas

sachusetts landscape.
Some other attempts by Gut
hrie to bring humor to his show
were less ingenious, depending
on slapstick and the use of props.
This did not detract from the au
dience's enthusiasm for the
stunts, however. Arlo and the
band did a rendition of the Sons
of the Pioneers' classic "Tumbl
ing Tumbleweeds" complete
with cowboy hats and a
tumbleweed bombardment. In
an encore, they donned hard
hats for a proud performance of
Merle Haggard's "Okee From
Muscogee."
This was a well-paced, diverse
show. Whether performing
finely-tailored rock arrange
ments, protest songs and bal
lads, novelty songs or inane
monologues, Guthrie and his
band kept things moving and
pleasantly surprising for the au
dience. The absence of such hits
as "Alice's Restaurant" and
"City of New Orleans" did not
seem to hurt the concert in the
least, and that is impressive.
The public's aff3ction for Gut
hrie is deserved and does not
show any signs of diminishing.
Yet his potential for really mov
ing audiences has not quite been
reached. But if this concert is any
indication, he's moving in the
right direction.

the driving beat, gave the song
the power and bite that it needed
without crowding Guthrie and

the lyrics off the stage. This was
also true in the Rolling Stones'
"Connection" and the Beatle's
"I've Just Seen a Face," popular
songs whose familiarity was en
livened by Guthrie's arrange
ments.
The rest of the show, includ
ing Guthrie's protest songs.—
both his own and his father's—
also benefited from the versatil
ity and security Shenandoah
provided.
Dressed in denim, his eyes
closed, his expression and clear
voice serious, Guthrie per
formed such songs as "Pretty
Boy Floyd," "This Land is Your

Land" and "Buffalo Skinners" in
a dramatic manner that brought
the audience to a hush. Al
though Arlo has created his own
distinctive personality, he
shows pride in his father's le
gacy by including Woody's
songs in the act.

One of the highlights of the
concert was another
monologue/song about the ter
rors faced by the early American
settlers in the form of "giant
humongous clams." According
to Guthrie, these man-eating
bivalves grew feet and chased
puritans across the Mas

sachusetts landscape.
Some other attempts by Gut
hrie to bring humor to his show
were less ingenious, depending
on slapstick and the use of props.
This did not detract from the au
dience's enthusiasm for the
stunts, however. Arlo and the
band did a rendition of the Sons
of the Pioneers' classic "Tumbl
ing Tumbleweeds" complete
with cowboy hats and a
tumbleweed bombardment. In
an encore, they donned hard
hats for a proud performance of
Merle Haggard's "Okee From
Muscogee."
This was a well-paced, diverse
show. Whether performing
finely-tailored rock arrange
ments, protest songs and bal
lads, novelty songs or inane
monologues, Guthrie and his
band kept things moving and
pleasantly surprising for the au
dience. The absence of such hits
as "Alice's Restaurant" and
"City of New Orleans" did not
seem to hurt the concert in the
least, and that is impressive.
The public's aff3ction for Gut

Yet his potential for really mov

reached. But if this concert is any
indication, he's moving in the
right direction.
It's not easy to be the son of a
legend. Yet this is something
Arlo Guthrie has had to contend
with all his professional life. In
light of the recent widespread
interest in Woody Guthrie, stir
red up by the movie Bound For
Glory, Arlo's concert last week at
the Berkeley Community Thea
ter showed how far he has come
in forging his own identity.
You were probably introduced
to Arlo Guthrie as the innocent,
scruffy chronicler of the "Alice's
Restaurant Massacre": the
stoned-out Will Rogers of the
'60s. And this is one of the sides
that Arlo presented in the con
cert to the delight of the Berkeley
audience. Accompanying him
self on the piano, he opened with
a long, rambling, monologue/
song giving his version of the
exodus from Egypt. According
to Guthrie, the fleeing Israelites
found that the pharaoh had
sabotaged them by replacing the
sandwiches, hot sauce and Pep
sis in their knapsacks with
marijuana. The plan was to bust
them for transporting dope ac
ross the Egyptian state line.
Guthrie was joined at the end
of the monologue by his five
piece band, Shenandoah, a ver
satile, well-rehearsed folk
country band. They had the per
sonality to stand alone, perform
ing a number of well-received

songs, and their presence
strengthened Guthrie's mo
ments in the spot. With the fine
instrumental and vocal backing
provided by Shenandoah, Gut
hrie seems to have found the
freedom and the foundation that
his songs have needed.

A good example of this was
the upbeat, rock version of his
standard, "Coming Into Los
Angeles," the most compelling
rendition of that song to date.
