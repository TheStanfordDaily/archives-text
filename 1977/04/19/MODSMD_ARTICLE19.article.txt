## 'Boyfriend' scarcely amiable 
### 
The Boy Friend by Sandy Wilson is probably one
of the most inane musical comedies ever to stum
ble onto Broadway. It suffers from a boring plot,
corny lines and uninspired music. Since these are
the major requ irehents for a good musical comedy,
it is difficult to imagine that The Boy Friend could
ever be enjoyable.
On April 9, however, I did indeed sit through an
enjoyable performance of this musical at Arroyo
dining hall.
Arroyo's production of The Boy Friend correctly
did not attempt to overcome the intrinsic flaws of
the show, but rather accepted them and relied
upon smaller things to carry the show. I was very
impressed by the creative use of lighting and the

well-staged dance numbers. 1 found the use of film
clips to establish the setting for act two particu
larly interesting. Directors Robin Bernheim and
Jane√üozga deserve praise for an unusual creativity
seldom seen in dorm productions.
Essentially the story is nothing more than a veh
icle to deliver a number of roaring '20s era quasi
jazz songs. This would be fine if the songs were not
horrible. However, both Cindy Whitaker and Clif
ford Colvin pulled them off admirably. Turning in
excellent supporting performances among a cast
with good depth were Steven Shafer as Lord Broc
khurst, Patty Thistlethwaite asHortense, and Scott
Gil as the waiter.
