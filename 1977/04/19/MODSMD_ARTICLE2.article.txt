# Study proposes end to Saturday mail delivery

### 
Washington (AP) — Mail deliveries
should be cut back to five days a week
and taxpayer subsidies of the Postal
Service increased, but even these ac
tions will not keep postal rates from
soaring, a federal study commission
said yesterday.
The Commission on Postal Service
said mailing a first class letter will cost
about 28 cents by 1985 if mail service
continues on its present course.
It said the first-class rate can be
"held" to around 22 cents by 1985 if
reduced deliveries and higher tax
payer subsidies are adopted. The rate
was six cents in 1971 when the Postal
Service was established.
The commission told Congress and
President Jimmy Carter the cost of de
livering the mail will go up rapidly no
matter what the Postal Service does.
The report is expected to set off a
debate in Congress on what to do about
the deficit-ridden Postal Service.
There has been considerable opposi
tion in Congress to previous sugges
tions to eliminate Saturday delivery or
to increase subsidies.
Public willing
The commission said public opin
ion surveys that it ordered found "that
the public is willing to forego some
postal services in order to lessen rate
increases and limit congressional ap
propriations."
It recommended:
—Saving $412 million per year by
cutting deliveries to five days per
week, probably by eliminating Satur
day service. Window service at post
offices still would be available on the
sixth day.
—Increasing the subsidy by chang
ing it from 10 per cent of the current
year's budget and by giving the Postal
Service a one-time $625 million sub

sidy to help pay existing debts.
Increase in funding
Since the Postal Service budget is
continually rising, pegging the sub
sidy to the current year's spending
would increase the funding. For
example, the service would have re
ceived $2.1 billion instead of $1.6 bill
ion this past fiscal year if the subsidy
had been pegged to the current budget
instead of the 1971 budget.
—Deciding within two years if elec
tronic message services should par
tially replace traditional letter service.
—Establishing strict limits on when
the Postal Service could close a rural
post office to save money.
"The commission found the public
generally satisfied with postal service,
but concluded that the Postal Service
faces a foreboding financial future if it
continues on its present course," the
report said.
