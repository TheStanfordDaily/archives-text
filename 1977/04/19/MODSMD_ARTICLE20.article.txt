## New releases: Scott stars in a winner, Newman in a loser 
### 
Slapshot
A Unlvereal Picture, directed by Qeorge Roy
Hill. Written by Nancy Dowd. Starring Paul
Newman, Jennifer Warren, Mlchaal Ontkean,
Strother Martin. MPAA rating: R. Reviewed Old
Mill Six Theatre, Mountain Vlaw, April 4, 1977.
Everybody knows that Paul
Newman is fun to watch, and
that he has been the female
heartthrob for 20 years. But it
seems sad to think that the only
two people who can save his
movies from being bombs are
Robert Redford and Steve
McQueen, for Newman's only
big successes recently have been
Butch Ccissidy and the Sun
dance Kid, The Sting and The
Towering Inferno. Even the di
rector of the first two, George
Roy Hill, can't save him, but you
can't say he didn't try.
As a matter of fact, with Slap
Shot as evidence, you can say
that Hill tried too hard. Putting
the director of The Sting together
with Paul Newman in a satire on
ice hockey and the American
penchant for sportsmanlike vio
lence sounds like an unbeatable
combination. So unbeatable, in
fact, that no one took the trouble
to make sure the movie was good
before they released it. I mean,
anybody can throw rum, ice,
peaches and sugar into a blen
der, but everything has to be
measured for it to be a class-A
daiquiri.
Haphazard
And that's where Slap Shot
goes awry. Nobody measured
any of its ingredients. Screen
writer Nancy Dowd — and much
has been made of a woman writ
ing a sports script — doesn't
create any less plastic women
than male screenwriters. The
players' wives are portrayed as
stupid, scatter-brained, frus
trated bitches, but no point is
made about how they got to be
that way. Similarly, all the other
important aspects of Slap Shot
are treated in that same
haphazard fashion.
The film is unfocused and
sometimes so rickety as to be un
sure of its own message. It wob
bles back and forth between the
importance of hockey in cathar
ticblood-lettingand the silliness
of grown men who ignite like
methane gas and attack the
nearest animate or inanimate ob
ject. The blurriness comes from
the desire for completely out

rageous comedy and a sharp, in
cisive satire on American sports,
as if Hill was alternately unsure
of the quality of his satire (it
could have been great) and in
serted idiotic sequences for
guaranteed laughter. Slap Shot
sells out, and as a result is an
unfunny, overlong, diluted mix
ture of overstated jokes. Even
The Bud News Bears, as unfo
cused as it was, managed to be
more consistent overall than
Slap Shot.
Sexually deprived
The story of a losing coach
(Newnmn) trying to inspire a los
ing team into victory suffers
from a plethora of sub-plots that
simply don't mesh together. The
coach has his nose into every
thing — his team's sex lives, his
opponents' sex lives, even the
owner's sex life — yet nothing
about everyone's dissolving
marriages ever coalesce into log
ical motivations for the charac
ters — unless it's because they're
all sexually deprived.
Michael Ontkean, for in
stance, plays a stubborn, upright
player who eventually comes
around to Newman's contention
that the team's entertainment
value exceeds their athletic abil
ity. He is last seen skating off the
ice wearing only a jock strap and
carrying a trophy. But since he
has been portrayed as the only
sensible person in the film, are
we supposed to believe that he
really would resort to the sen
sationalistic tactics that he did
and look like he was enjoying it?
The scene, only one among
others, jars the supposed intent
of the film, whatever it was, and
makes one wonder as one leaves
what, after all, Hill and Newman
and Dowd were actually trying
to say about bloodthirsty living.
Islands in the Stream
A Paramount releaee, produced by Peter Bart
and Max Palevaky. Directed by Franklin J.
Schaffner. Written by Denna Bart Petiteterc.
Photographed by Fred Koenekamp. Starring
George C. Scott, David Hemmlnga, Gilbert Ro
land and Claire Bloom. MPAA rating: PG Re
viewed March 31, 1977, JWA Screening Room,
Sen Franc laco.
Every so often there comes a
film that is so unique in its sen
sitivity, its beauty, and its sheer
quality that it jumps out from the
screen at you and your life is
never quite the same from that
evening forward. Two such
films were Alice Doesn't Live

Here Anymore and Dog Day Af
ternoon.
Now there is another —
Franklin Schaffner's Islands In
The Stream, with George C.
Scott, based on Ernest Heming
way's last novel, posthumously
published in 1970. The story of
an expatriate artist living in the
Bahamas in 1940, just as World
War II begins, is divided into
three sections — The Boys, The
Woman and The Journey — as
Thomas Hudson (Scott) first in
teracts with his three sons who
come to visit, then his ex-wife
(Claire Bloom), and finally with
European refugees he helps
smuggle into Cuba.
With rituals of manhood, the
importance of loyalty, the
abhorrence of apathy, and the
glory of heroism, the film com
ments on the ideals of love, fam
ily and sacrifice with simple
honesty. Ideals are there — they
may not be attainable, but they
should be strived for as long and
as often as possible.
Islands In The Stream is a uni
versal film about life that will
touch anyone who has ever
loved or hated their families, or
who has ever loved or hated their
life. It has a quality to it, an inde
scribable tenderness, which sets
it apart from most films which
strive for instant emotions.
The emotions of Islands In
The Stream go deeper than
simple corporeal shock. It
reaches into the cerebral con
sciousness, affecting the viewer

far more effectively and far
longer than most films. It has a
way of digging in and not letting
go.
While it has a pretentious ad
vertising campaign, the film also
has everything that the cam
paign says it has. Don't be put off
by the snobbishness of it — Is
lands In The Stream is so far
superior to other films that it
shouldn't be publicized in the
same way.
George C. Scott has never been
one of my favorite actors — until
now. He takes the part of Hud
son, and ingests it into himself,
protecting the investment of
Hemingway but at the same time
making the character all his
own. With his salt-and-pepper
beard, and his sons calling him
Papa, the resemblance to the au
thor is clear.
This is undoubtedly Scott's
best performance since Patton,
when he was also under Schaff
ner's direction (both won Oscars
for it). Could it really be seven
years ago? It's enough to make
one consider giving up movies
until Schaffner and Scott col
laborate again, because anything
is a disappointment after Islands
In The Stream.
The photography by Fred J.
Koenekamp done on the islands
of Kauai, particularly the land
scapes and the seascapes, are
breathtaking. The film is a stun
ning visual adventure as well as
a stunning emotional adventure.

Everybody knows that Paul
Newman is fun to watch, and
that he has been the female
heartthrob for 20 years. But it
seems sad to think that the only
two people who can save his
movies from being bombs are
Robert Redford and Steve
McQueen, for Newman's only
big successes recently have been
Butch Ccissidy and the Sun
dance Kid, The Sting and The
Towering Inferno. Even the di
rector of the first two, George
Roy Hill, can't save him, but you
can't say he didn't try.
As a matter of fact, with Slap
Shot as evidence, you can say
that Hill tried too hard. Putting
the director of The Sting together
with Paul Newman in a satire on
ice hockey and the American
penchant for sportsmanlike vio
lence sounds like an unbeatable
combination. So unbeatable, in
fact, that no one took the trouble
to make sure the movie was good
before they released it. I mean,
anybody can throw rum, ice,
peaches and sugar into a blen
der, but everything has to be
measured for it to be a class-A
daiquiri.
Haphazard
And that's where Slap Shot
goes awry. Nobody measured
any of its ingredients. Screen
writer Nancy Dowd — and much
has been made of a woman writ
ing a sports script — doesn't
create any less plastic women
than male screenwriters. The
players' wives are portrayed as
stupid, scatter-brained, frus
trated bitches, but no point is
made about how they got to be
that way. Similarly, all the other
important aspects of Slap Shot
are treated in that same
haphazard fashion.
The film is unfocused and
sometimes so rickety as to be un
sure of its own message. It wob
bles back and forth between the
importance of hockey in cathar
ticblood-lettingand the silliness
of grown men who ignite like
methane gas and attack the
nearest animate or inanimate ob
ject. The blurriness comes from
the desire for completely out

rageous comedy and a sharp, in
cisive satire on American sports,
as if Hill was alternately unsure
of the quality of his satire (it
could have been great) and in
serted idiotic sequences for
guaranteed laughter. Slap Shot
sells out, and as a result is an
unfunny, overlong, diluted mix
ture of overstated jokes. Even
The Bud News Bears, as unfo
cused as it was, managed to be
more consistent overall than
Slap Shot.
Sexually deprived
The story of a losing coach
(Newnmn) trying to inspire a los
ing team into victory suffers
from a plethora of sub-plots that
simply don't mesh together. The
coach has his nose into every
thing — his team's sex lives, his
opponents' sex lives, even the
owner's sex life — yet nothing
about everyone's dissolving
marriages ever coalesce into log
ical motivations for the charac
ters — unless it's because they're
all sexually deprived.
Michael Ontkean, for in
stance, plays a stubborn, upright
player who eventually comes
around to Newman's contention
that the team's entertainment
value exceeds their athletic abil
ity. He is last seen skating off the
ice wearing only a jock strap and
carrying a trophy. But since he
has been portrayed as the only
sensible person in the film, are
we supposed to believe that he
really would resort to the sen
sationalistic tactics that he did
and look like he was enjoying it?
The scene, only one among
others, jars the supposed intent
of the film, whatever it was, and
makes one wonder as one leaves
what, after all, Hill and Newman
and Dowd were actually trying
to say about bloodthirsty living.

Every so often there comes a
film that is so unique in its sen
sitivity, its beauty, and its sheer
quality that it jumps out from the

never quite the same from that
evening forward. Two such
films were Alice Doesn't Live

Now there is another —
Franklin Schaffner's Islands In
The Stream, with George C.
Scott, based on Ernest Heming
way's last novel, posthumously
published in 1970. The story of
an expatriate artist living in the
Bahamas in 1940, just as World
War II begins, is divided into
three sections — The Boys, The
Woman and The Journey — as
Thomas Hudson (Scott) first in
teracts with his three sons who
come to visit, then his ex-wife
(Claire Bloom), and finally with
European refugees he helps
smuggle into Cuba.
With rituals of manhood, the
importance of loyalty, the
abhorrence of apathy, and the
glory of heroism, the film com
ments on the ideals of love, fam
ily and sacrifice with simple
honesty. Ideals are there — they
may not be attainable, but they
should be strived for as long and
as often as possible.
Islands In The Stream is a uni
versal film about life that will
touch anyone who has ever
loved or hated their families, or
who has ever loved or hated their
life. It has a quality to it, an inde
scribable tenderness, which sets
it apart from most films which
strive for instant emotions.
The emotions of Islands In
The Stream go deeper than
simple corporeal shock. It
reaches into the cerebral con
sciousness, affecting the viewer

far more effectively and far
longer than most films. It has a
way of digging in and not letting
go.
While it has a pretentious ad
vertising campaign, the film also
has everything that the cam
paign says it has. Don't be put off
by the snobbishness of it — Is
lands In The Stream is so far
superior to other films that it
shouldn't be publicized in the
same way.
George C. Scott has never been
one of my favorite actors — until
now. He takes the part of Hud
son, and ingests it into himself,
protecting the investment of
Hemingway but at the same time
making the character all his
own. With his salt-and-pepper
beard, and his sons calling him
Papa, the resemblance to the au
thor is clear.
This is undoubtedly Scott's
best performance since Patton,
when he was also under Schaff
ner's direction (both won Oscars
for it). Could it really be seven
years ago? It's enough to make
one consider giving up movies
until Schaffner and Scott col
laborate again, because anything
is a disappointment after Islands
In The Stream.
The photography by Fred J.
Koenekamp done on the islands
of Kauai, particularly the land
scapes and the seascapes, are
breathtaking. The film is a stun
ning visual adventure as well as
a stunning emotional adventure.

movies from being bombs are
Robert Redford and Steve
McQueen, for Newman's only
big successes recently have been
Butch Ccissidy and the Sun
dance Kid, The Sting and The
Towering Inferno. Even the di
rector of the first two, George
Roy Hill, can't save him, but you
can't say he didn't try.
As a matter of fact, with Slap
Shot as evidence, you can say
that Hill tried too hard. Putting
the director of The Sting together
with Paul Newman in a satire on
ice hockey and the American
penchant for sportsmanlike vio
lence sounds like an unbeatable
combination. So unbeatable, in
fact, that no one took the trouble
to make sure the movie was good
before they released it. I mean,
anybody can throw rum, ice,
peaches and sugar into a blen
der, but everything has to be
measured for it to be a class-A
daiquiri.
Haphazard
And that's where Slap Shot
goes awry. Nobody measured
any of its ingredients. Screen
writer Nancy Dowd — and much
has been made of a woman writ
ing a sports script — doesn't
create any less plastic women
than male screenwriters. The
players' wives are portrayed as
stupid, scatter-brained, frus
trated bitches, but no point is
made about how they got to be
that way. Similarly, all the other
important aspects of Slap Shot
are treated in that same
haphazard fashion.
The film is unfocused and
sometimes so rickety as to be un
sure of its own message. It wob
bles back and forth between the
importance of hockey in cathar
ticblood-lettingand the silliness
of grown men who ignite like
methane gas and attack the
nearest animate or inanimate ob
ject. The blurriness comes from
the desire for completely out

rageous comedy and a sharp, in
cisive satire on American sports,
as if Hill was alternately unsure
of the quality of his satire (it
could have been great) and in
serted idiotic sequences for
guaranteed laughter. Slap Shot
sells out, and as a result is an
unfunny, overlong, diluted mix
ture of overstated jokes. Even
The Bud News Bears, as unfo
cused as it was, managed to be
more consistent overall than
Slap Shot.
Sexually deprived
The story of a losing coach
(Newnmn) trying to inspire a los
ing team into victory suffers
from a plethora of sub-plots that
simply don't mesh together. The
coach has his nose into every
thing — his team's sex lives, his
opponents' sex lives, even the
owner's sex life — yet nothing
about everyone's dissolving
marriages ever coalesce into log
ical motivations for the charac
ters — unless it's because they're
all sexually deprived.
Michael Ontkean, for in
stance, plays a stubborn, upright
player who eventually comes
around to Newman's contention
that the team's entertainment
value exceeds their athletic abil
ity. He is last seen skating off the
ice wearing only a jock strap and
carrying a trophy. But since he
has been portrayed as the only
sensible person in the film, are
we supposed to believe that he
really would resort to the sen
sationalistic tactics that he did
and look like he was enjoying it?
The scene, only one among
others, jars the supposed intent
of the film, whatever it was, and
makes one wonder as one leaves
what, after all, Hill and Newman
and Dowd were actually trying
to say about bloodthirsty living.
Islands in the Stream

Every so often there comes a
film that is so unique in its sen
sitivity, its beauty, and its sheer
quality that it jumps out from the
screen at you and your life is
never quite the same from that
evening forward. Two such
films were Alice Doesn't Live

Here Anymore and Dog Day Af
ternoon.
Now there is another —
Franklin Schaffner's Islands In
The Stream, with George C.
Scott, based on Ernest Heming
way's last novel, posthumously
published in 1970. The story of
an expatriate artist living in the
Bahamas in 1940, just as World
War II begins, is divided into
three sections — The Boys, The
Woman and The Journey — as
Thomas Hudson (Scott) first in
teracts with his three sons who
come to visit, then his ex-wife
(Claire Bloom), and finally with
European refugees he helps
smuggle into Cuba.
With rituals of manhood, the
importance of loyalty, the
abhorrence of apathy, and the
glory of heroism, the film com
ments on the ideals of love, fam
ily and sacrifice with simple
honesty. Ideals are there — they
may not be attainable, but they
should be strived for as long and
as often as possible.
Islands In The Stream is a uni
versal film about life that will
touch anyone who has ever
loved or hated their families, or
who has ever loved or hated their
life. It has a quality to it, an inde
scribable tenderness, which sets
it apart from most films which
strive for instant emotions.
The emotions of Islands In
The Stream go deeper than
simple corporeal shock. It
reaches into the cerebral con
sciousness, affecting the viewer

far more effectively and far
longer than most films. It has a
way of digging in and not letting
go.
While it has a pretentious ad
vertising campaign, the film also
has everything that the cam
paign says it has. Don't be put off
by the snobbishness of it — Is
lands In The Stream is so far
superior to other films that it
shouldn't be publicized in the
same way.
George C. Scott has never been
one of my favorite actors — until
now. He takes the part of Hud
son, and ingests it into himself,
protecting the investment of
Hemingway but at the same time
making the character all his
own. With his salt-and-pepper
beard, and his sons calling him
Papa, the resemblance to the au
thor is clear.
This is undoubtedly Scott's
best performance since Patton,
when he was also under Schaff
ner's direction (both won Oscars
for it). Could it really be seven
years ago? It's enough to make
one consider giving up movies
until Schaffner and Scott col
laborate again, because anything
is a disappointment after Islands
In The Stream.
The photography by Fred J.
Koenekamp done on the islands
of Kauai, particularly the land
scapes and the seascapes, are
breathtaking. The film is a stun
ning visual adventure as well as
a stunning emotional adventure.

can't say he didn't try.
As a matter of fact, with Slap
Shot as evidence, you can say
that Hill tried too hard. Putting
the director of The Sting together
with Paul Newman in a satire on
ice hockey and the American
penchant for sportsmanlike vio
lence sounds like an unbeatable
combination. So unbeatable, in
fact, that no one took the trouble
to make sure the movie was good
before they released it. I mean,
anybody can throw rum, ice,
peaches and sugar into a blen
der, but everything has to be
measured for it to be a class-A
daiquiri.
Haphazard
And that's where Slap Shot
goes awry. Nobody measured
any of its ingredients. Screen
writer Nancy Dowd — and much
has been made of a woman writ
ing a sports script — doesn't
create any less plastic women
than male screenwriters. The
players' wives are portrayed as
stupid, scatter-brained, frus
trated bitches, but no point is
made about how they got to be
that way. Similarly, all the other
important aspects of Slap Shot
are treated in that same
haphazard fashion.
The film is unfocused and
sometimes so rickety as to be un
sure of its own message. It wob
bles back and forth between the
importance of hockey in cathar
ticblood-lettingand the silliness
of grown men who ignite like
methane gas and attack the
nearest animate or inanimate ob
ject. The blurriness comes from
the desire for completely out

rageous comedy and a sharp, in
cisive satire on American sports,
as if Hill was alternately unsure
of the quality of his satire (it
could have been great) and in
serted idiotic sequences for
guaranteed laughter. Slap Shot
sells out, and as a result is an
unfunny, overlong, diluted mix
ture of overstated jokes. Even
The Bud News Bears, as unfo
cused as it was, managed to be
more consistent overall than
Slap Shot.
Sexually deprived
The story of a losing coach
(Newnmn) trying to inspire a los
ing team into victory suffers
from a plethora of sub-plots that
simply don't mesh together. The
coach has his nose into every
thing — his team's sex lives, his
opponents' sex lives, even the
owner's sex life — yet nothing
about everyone's dissolving
marriages ever coalesce into log
ical motivations for the charac
ters — unless it's because they're
all sexually deprived.
Michael Ontkean, for in
stance, plays a stubborn, upright
player who eventually comes
around to Newman's contention
that the team's entertainment
value exceeds their athletic abil
ity. He is last seen skating off the
ice wearing only a jock strap and
carrying a trophy. But since he
has been portrayed as the only
sensible person in the film, are
we supposed to believe that he
really would resort to the sen
sationalistic tactics that he did
and look like he was enjoying it?
The scene, only one among
others, jars the supposed intent
of the film, whatever it was, and
makes one wonder as one leaves
what, after all, Hill and Newman
and Dowd were actually trying
to say about bloodthirsty living.
Islands in the Stream
A Paramount releaee, produced by Peter Bart
and Max Palevaky. Directed by Franklin J.
Schaffner. Written by Denna Bart Petiteterc.

viewed March 31, 1977, JWA Screening Room,
Sen Franc laco.
Every so often there comes a
film that is so unique in its sen
sitivity, its beauty, and its sheer
quality that it jumps out from the
screen at you and your life is
never quite the same from that
evening forward. Two such
films were Alice Doesn't Live

Here Anymore and Dog Day Af
ternoon.
Now there is another —
Franklin Schaffner's Islands In
The Stream, with George C.
Scott, based on Ernest Heming
way's last novel, posthumously
published in 1970. The story of
an expatriate artist living in the
Bahamas in 1940, just as World
War II begins, is divided into
three sections — The Boys, The
Woman and The Journey — as
Thomas Hudson (Scott) first in
teracts with his three sons who
come to visit, then his ex-wife
(Claire Bloom), and finally with
European refugees he helps
smuggle into Cuba.
With rituals of manhood, the
importance of loyalty, the
abhorrence of apathy, and the
glory of heroism, the film com
ments on the ideals of love, fam
ily and sacrifice with simple
honesty. Ideals are there — they
may not be attainable, but they
should be strived for as long and
as often as possible.
Islands In The Stream is a uni
versal film about life that will
touch anyone who has ever
loved or hated their families, or
who has ever loved or hated their
life. It has a quality to it, an inde
scribable tenderness, which sets
it apart from most films which
strive for instant emotions.
The emotions of Islands In
The Stream go deeper than
simple corporeal shock. It
reaches into the cerebral con
sciousness, affecting the viewer

far more effectively and far
longer than most films. It has a
way of digging in and not letting
go.
While it has a pretentious ad
vertising campaign, the film also
has everything that the cam
paign says it has. Don't be put off
by the snobbishness of it — Is
lands In The Stream is so far
superior to other films that it
shouldn't be publicized in the
same way.
George C. Scott has never been
one of my favorite actors — until
now. He takes the part of Hud
son, and ingests it into himself,
protecting the investment of
Hemingway but at the same time
making the character all his
own. With his salt-and-pepper
beard, and his sons calling him
Papa, the resemblance to the au
thor is clear.
This is undoubtedly Scott's
best performance since Patton,
when he was also under Schaff
ner's direction (both won Oscars
for it). Could it really be seven
years ago? It's enough to make
one consider giving up movies
until Schaffner and Scott col
laborate again, because anything
is a disappointment after Islands
In The Stream.
The photography by Fred J.
Koenekamp done on the islands
of Kauai, particularly the land
scapes and the seascapes, are
breathtaking. The film is a stun
ning visual adventure as well as
a stunning emotional adventure.
