# Earl Klugh at Keystone S.F.
## 
### 
Talented jazz guitarist Earl
Klugh will be featured at San
Francisco's Keystone Korner
Tuesday, April 19 through Sun
day, April 24 (minors are wel
come).
Earl's last Bay Area appear
ance was at Zellerbach Au
ditorium where the audience
greeted him very enthusiasti
cally. True to form, Earl exhi
bited the vast wealth of his abil
ity with a soulful rendition of "I
Heard It Through The
Grapevine" and a sensitive solo
entitled "The April Fools."
Backed by a fine band, Earl was
in complete control throughout
the concert. The audience was
with him the whole way and
would not allow him to leave
without an encore. The concert
proved to be quite delightful.
Twenty-three year-old Klugh
combines diverse jazz influ
ences with a talent for texture
and rhythm to create a distinc
tive and exciting listening ex
perience. At 15, famed jazz man
Yuseff Lateef offered the young
musician a chance to record with
him. Naturally, Earl accepted. At

17, he met George Benson and
later joined Benson's band. The
interplay between these two
premier guitarists resulted in an
electrifying total sound.
Earl's next move was to Chick
Corea's legendary Return To
Forever, where Earl received an
education in electronics and de
veloped his searing, high-energy

mode of playing. Later, Earl left
to work with another jazz
legend, George Shearing. Fi
nally, he returned home to inter
grate the invaluable skills and
knowledge he had gained by his
association with some of the
greatest names in progressive
jazz. His two releases thus far,
Earl Klugh and Living Inside
Your Love, are both excellent.
