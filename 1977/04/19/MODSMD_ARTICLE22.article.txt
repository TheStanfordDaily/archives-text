Patricia Hearst pleads no contest
Los Angeles — Patricia Hearst, entering a surprise
plea, whispered the words "nolo contendere" yes
terday and was found guilty of armed robbery and
assault with a deadly weapon.
The judge who accepted her no contest plea and
declared her guilty under the law said he would
sentence her May 9.
The 23-year-old newspaper heiress, already under
• a seven-year federal sentence for bank robbery, faces
•the possibility of 15V2 years to life in prison, but she
could also receive straight probation, prosecutors
said.
She pleaded to two counts of an 11-count indict

ment. The refraining nine counts will be dismissed,
but the two counts — the most grave according to the
prosecution — carry additional accusations of
firearms use which increase the number of years of
Hearst's possible jail term.
The judge said, "I find the defendant guilty."
Dist. Atty. John Van de Kamp declined to reveal
what recommendation his office would make for
sentencing but said that a new California deter
minante sentencing law, which takes effect next
July, could reduce Hearst's potential penalty and
would remove the possibility of life in prison.
Carter asks for water project cut
Washington — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that Congress should kill 15 water projects
and cut funding for five others in order to save $4
billion in federal money and help preserve the envi
ronment.
He also urged Congress to delete funding for three
additional projects, but said he might recommend
full or partial funding for them after further analysis.
The president recommended full funding for the
remaining nine projects that had been on his "hit
list."
Carter placed 30 of the projects on the list last
month, saying they should be reviewed to see
whether they are wasteful, unsafe or environmen
tally unsound. Members of Congress in whose states
they are located have been fighting fiercely for them.
In announcing his decisions, Carter also urged
"major policy reforms" in dam safety, project evalu
ation standards, cost sharing with beneficiaries of
the projects, water conservation and the use of dams,
reservoirs and waterways to create jobs.
Carter said he does not intend to stop reviewing
the nation's water policies and programs. "Further
work needs to be done," he said, "and fundamental
improvements need to be made."
Labor Dept. inspections questioned
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday ag
reed to review the constitutionality ofcthe federal law
authorizing Labor Department inspectors to make
unannounced visits to factories and other work
places to check health and safety hazards.
The justices voted to hear the government's appeal

of a decision by a three-judge federal court in Idaho
striking down the law as a violation of the Fourth
Amendment protection of privacy.
The lower court ruling "would seriously impair
effective implementation of federal legislation de
signed to protect the health and safety of the nation's
workforce," warned attorneys from the Labor and
Justice Departments.
Barlow's Inc., a plumbing and heating installation
business in Pocatello, Idaho, filed the suit challeng
ing the statute after a court ordered the firm to admit
an inspector for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA).
The three-judge court declared the OSHA law un
constitutional on grounds that inspections con
ducted without court warrants violate the constitu
tional ban on unreasonable searches of private pre
mises.
Drought plagues state water supply
Sacramento — The State Water Project probably
won't be able to deliver any water to agricultural
customers next year if the drought continues this
winter, the state's water chief said yesterday.
Ronald Robie, director of the Department of Water
Resources, said the project had expected to provide
farmers with 10 per cent of what they normally re
ceive, if the drought continues.
But he said that estimate was being cut back to zero
because of worsening drought conditions.
"The main effect of this very dry spring will be
lower water levels in project reservoirs for all agen
cies," Robie said.
The State Water Project provides about five per
cent of all water used in California.
Robie made his comments as the state Drought
Information Center reported that stream run-off pro
jections had been revised downward in early April.
That means that water users who depend on
Northern California streams for their supply will
experience "continued" shortages this spring and
summer.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows tonight in mid 40s to
low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 60s near
the coast and the 70s to low 80s inland.
