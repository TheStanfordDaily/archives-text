# Urges sacrifices over disaster
## Carter talks to U.S. on energy 
### 
Washington (AP) —President Jimmy
Carter asked the nation last night to
make sacrifices and support what he
called his painful, unpopular prog
rams to conserve energy because "the
alternative may be a national catas
trophe."
"With the exception of preventing
war," Carter said in a television ad
dress, "this is the greatest challenge
our country will face during our
lifetimes. The energy crisis has not yet
overwhelmed us, but it will if we do
not act quickly."
Carter warned that the nation's oil
and gas supplies are running out and
that reserves in other parts of the world
will not be able to meet the rising de
mand for more than a few years longer.
He said his energy proposals "will
cause you to put up with inconveni
ences and to make sacrifices. Many of
these proposals will be unpopular."
However, he stressed, the energy
crisis "will get worse every day until
we act."
No details
Carter declined to unveil the details
of his program. The chief executive
plans to do that when he addresses
Congress tomorrow. Instead, he cited
specific goals to be achieved and the
principles used to formulate his prog
ram.
"We must be fair," he said. "Our
solutions must ask equal sacrifices
from every region, every class of
people, every interest group. Industry

wil 1 have to do its part to conserve, just
as consumers will. The energy pro
ducers deserve fair treatment, but we
will not let the oil companies pro
fiteer."
Seven goals
To meet the energy challenge, Carter
set seven goals to be met by the nation
by 1985:
—Reduce the growth rate of the U.S.
energy demand from its 3.5 per cent or
4 per cent a year to less than 2 per cent.
—Cut gasoline demand 10 per cent
below current levels.
—Cut oil imports, currently close to
nine million barrels per day, down to
about six million barrels a day.
—Establish a strategic petroleum re
serve of one billion barrels, enough to
keep the nation going through at least
a six-month interruption of petroleum
supplies.
—Increase coal production by about
two-thirds to more than one billion
tons a year.
—Insulate 90 per cent of American
homes and all new buildings.
—Use solar energy in more than 2.5
million houses.
Gasoline tax
A draft of White House proposals
obtained by news media showed that
Carter was seriously considering a
"standby" gasoline tax reaching as
high as 50 cents a gallon, taxes ranging
from $412 to $2500 on gas-guzzling
automobiles and price hikes on oil and
natural gas in general.
The energy draft also pointed to
mandatory standards for building in
sulation and appliance efficiency, and
measures to make power plants and
industries that burn oil or gas switch to
coal.
"I am sure each of you will find some
thing you don't like about the specifics
of our proposal," Carter said.
Painful sacrifices
"It will demand that we make sac
rifices and changes in our lives.
"To some degree the sacrifices will
be painful—but so is any meaningful
sacrifice. It will lead to some higher
costs, and to some greater inconveni
ences for everyone.
"But the sacrifices will be gradual,
realistic and necessary," Carter added.
"Above all, they will be fair."
Carter said his administration will
check data from oil and natural gas
companies "so that we will know their
true production, supplies, reserves
and profits."
In one of the few specific points of
his address, Carter said that "citizens
who insist on driving large, unneces
sarily powerful cars must expect to pay
more for that luxury."
But Carter said a tough energy prog

ram is essential because "the oil and
natural gas we rely on for 75 per cent of
our energy are running out.
"We must not be selfish or timid if
we hope to have a decent world for our
children and grandchildren. We sim
ply must balance our demand for
energy with our rapidly shrinking re
sources."
Carter said, "By acting now we can
control our future instead of letting the
future control us.
"If we fail to act soon, we will face an
economic, social and political crisis
that will threaten our free institu
tions."

—Reduce the growth rate of the U.S.
energy demand from its 3.5 per cent or
4 per cent a year to less than 2 per cent.
—Cut gasoline demand 10 per cent
below current levels.
—Cut oil imports, currently close to
nine million barrels per day, down to
about six million barrels a day.
—Establish a strategic petroleum re
serve of one billion barrels, enough to
keep the nation going through at least
a six-month interruption of petroleum
supplies.
—Increase coal production by about
two-thirds to more than one billion
tons a year.
—Insulate 90 per cent of American
homes and all new buildings.
—Use solar energy in more than 2.5
million houses.
Gasoline tax
A draft of White House proposals
obtained by news media showed that
Carter was seriously considering a
"standby" gasoline tax reaching as
high as 50 cents a gallon, taxes ranging
from $412 to $2500 on gas-guzzling
automobiles and price hikes on oil and
natural gas in general.
The energy draft also pointed to
mandatory standards for building in
sulation and appliance efficiency, and
measures to make power plants and
industries that burn oil or gas switch to
coal.
"I am sure each of you will find some
thing you don't like about the specifics
of our proposal," Carter said.
Painful sacrifices
"It will demand that we make sac
rifices and changes in our lives.
"To some degree the sacrifices will
be painful—but so is any meaningful
sacrifice. It will lead to some higher
costs, and to some greater inconveni
ences for everyone.
"But the sacrifices will be gradual,
realistic and necessary," Carter added.
"Above all, they will be fair."
Carter said his administration will
check data from oil and natural gas
companies "so that we will know their
true production, supplies, reserves
and profits."
In one of the few specific points of
his address, Carter said that "citizens
who insist on driving large, unneces
sarily powerful cars must expect to pay
more for that luxury."
But Carter said a tough energy prog

ram is essential because "the oil and
natural gas we rely on for 75 per cent of
our energy are running out.
"We must not be selfish or timid if
we hope to have a decent world for our
children and grandchildren. We sim
ply must balance our demand for
energy with our rapidly shrinking re
sources."
Carter said, "By acting now we can
control our future instead of letting the
future control us.
"If we fail to act soon, we will face an
economic, social and political crisis
that will threaten our free institu
tions."
Washington (AP) —President Jimmy
Carter asked the nation last night to
make sacrifices and support what he
called his painful, unpopular prog
rams to conserve energy because "the
alternative may be a national catas
trophe."
"With the exception of preventing
war," Carter said in a television ad
dress, "this is the greatest challenge
our country will face during our
lifetimes. The energy crisis has not yet
overwhelmed us, but it will if we do
not act quickly."
Carter warned that the nation's oil
and gas supplies are running out and
that reserves in other parts of the world
will not be able to meet the rising de
mand for more than a few years longer.
He said his energy proposals "will
cause you to put up with inconveni
ences and to make sacrifices. Many of
these proposals will be unpopular."
However, he stressed, the energy
crisis "will get worse every day until
we act."
No details
Carter declined to unveil the details
of his program. The chief executive
plans to do that when he addresses
Congress tomorrow. Instead, he cited
specific goals to be achieved and the
principles used to formulate his prog
ram.
"We must be fair," he said. "Our
solutions must ask equal sacrifices
from every region, every class of
people, every interest group. Industry

wil 1 have to do its part to conserve, just
as consumers will. The energy pro
ducers deserve fair treatment, but we
will not let the oil companies pro
fiteer."
Seven goals
To meet the energy challenge, Carter
set seven goals to be met by the nation
by 1985:
—Reduce the growth rate of the U.S.
energy demand from its 3.5 per cent or
4 per cent a year to less than 2 per cent.
—Cut gasoline demand 10 per cent
below current levels.
—Cut oil imports, currently close to
nine million barrels per day, down to
about six million barrels a day.
—Establish a strategic petroleum re
serve of one billion barrels, enough to
keep the nation going through at least
a six-month interruption of petroleum
supplies.
—Increase coal production by about
two-thirds to more than one billion
tons a year.
—Insulate 90 per cent of American
homes and all new buildings.
—Use solar energy in more than 2.5
million houses.
