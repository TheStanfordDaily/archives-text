### Randy David 
The University and the Chicano community are currently
discussing the future of the Chicano Affairs Office, accord
ing to Provost William Miller.
Cecilia Burciaga, adviser to the provost and assistant to
the president, now heads the Chicano Affairs Office. When
she took her position, she only agreed to stay in the position
until August, 1977, she said.
Various issues are being discussed including whetherthe
Office will function the same way, whether staffing will
remain the same, and how long the office will remain in
existence. Miller said. "The University is not committed to
eliminating the office," he added.
Burciaga said she is confident the office will not be ph
ased out.
"The internal inability to catch up with the needs of the
Chicano community and the external circumstances such
as the Bakke case makes it a difficult time to get rid of the

office in blanket form," she explained.
Chicano faculty, staff and students are working with
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for budget and planning
to devise a proposal. An ad hoc committee from theChicano
community led by Asst. Education Prof. Art Pacheco is
working with Bacchetti, according to Burciaga.
Members of the Chicano community unanimously agree
that it is "absolutely necessary to have a full-time replace
ment for Cecilia Burciaga," said junior Eddie Sosa, a
Chicano.
According to Burciaga, the Chicano community is look
ing for a full-time replacement for her, and hopes for posi
tions in the Personnel Office and the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
In a statement to the Faculty Senate, President Richard
Lyman stated, "The University should not close down the
office unless the functions of the office are being performed
elsewhere, and it is not clear that such is the case."
