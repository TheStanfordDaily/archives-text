# Fire set to recall petition, signatures called 'hoax'
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
Sen. Jim King set fire last night to a
petition seeking the recall of ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Chris Mathe after
King and Sen. Jeff Stoler announced to
the ASSU Senate they had decided
against submitting the petition.
Sen. Tim Ferguson objected to the
destruction of the petition, saying "I
don't believe the petitions are valid."
The senate had not examined the sig
natures on the petitions before they
were destroyed.
Stoler had previously claimed to
have 2000 signatures on petitions
seeking the recall for Mathe's violation
of a senate by-law requiring fee as
sessment refunds to be handed out in
White Plaza.
Stoler said he was not submitting
the petition because he felt Mathe was
sufficiently apologetic for his actions.
Earlier in the meeting Mathe
explained he refused to hand out fee
assessment rebates in White Plaza for
security reasons.

He said two security guards would
be needed to safeguard distribution
of refunds in White Plaza. He esti
mated costs for distributing the re
funds would be increased from the
current $120 to $500 or $600.
Vouchers
The senate voted 11 -3 to suspend the
portion of the Jan. 23 resolution requir
ing Mathe to distribute the refunds in
White Plaza. The senators instructed
him instead to hand out in White Plaza
vouchers which students can ex
change for money at the ASSU office.
When the senators lit the petition on
fire, Mathe said the destruction of the
petitions before it could be examined
"proves the signatures are not real or
Stoler and King wouldn't have de
stroyed them."
He added he felt the reputations of
himself and Asst. Financial Manager
Miles White had been damaged by the
publicity.
'You're next'
Mathe said he did not think the
threatening phone calls and notes he
and White, had received were funny.
Mathe said White was eating at a
Chinese restaurant when a waiter pre
sented him with a fortune cookie in
scribed with the words "you're next."
"The whole thing got started
through an error in the Daily," Stoler
asserted. He said the Daily was al
legedly told there were "16 or 15 sig
natures" on the petition but the Daily
misunderstood and quoted Hammer &
Coffin as saying "1650."
Stoler said, after the story and edito
rial were printed, they decided to per
petuate the error. "It got started rather
innocently and we did our best to carry
it out. I think we've done quite well. I
will defend what we did," Stoler said.
'Ridiculous' charge
"Stoler's charge that the Daily was
inaccurate is ridiculous. I support our
reporter completely," said Bonny
Rodden, Daily editor.

"Stoler called me over the weekend
and said he and King had been 'disin
genuous' with the Daily. How can we
take Stoler's word over the word of a
reporter when Stoler admits to deceiv
ing the Daily and then goes on to de
ceive the student body by carrying on
with his game," she asked after the
meeting.
Ferguson said while he "some
times" appreciated the "levity" the
two senators have brought to the se
nate this year, he felt "this hoax inci
dent blackened the names of students
who tried to control the outflow of
monies for philosophical reasons and
not for personal vendettas."
No one laughing
Addressing Stoler and King, Fergu
son continued, "If you look around, 1
don't think anyone is laughing any
more except yourselves."
A motion to censure Stoler and King
was tabled indefinitely, 11-5.
At the meeting, the senate also voted
to ratify the results of last week's elec
tion. Sen. J.J. Chao suggested some
method be instituted to distinguish
senior class officer ballots from those
of the general student body.
The senate also voted 11-1 to pass a
resolution submitted by Bruce Parker,
member of Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
to "urge Stanford University to vote in
favor of the shareholder resolutions
which call for non-expansion and/or
withdrawal of South African invest
ments."
The meeting ended with a 6-3 vote
favoring the adoption of Ferguson's
resolution: "Be it resolved that the
ASSU Senate believes Stanford Uni
versity needs a return of cheerleaders
about as much as it needs more nerds,
and asks the Athletic Department and
others pushing for the return of this
convention to let this sleeping dog
lie."

the ASSU Senate they had decided
against submitting the petition.
Sen. Tim Ferguson objected to the
destruction of the petition, saying "I
don't believe the petitions are valid."
The senate had not examined the sig
natures on the petitions before they
were destroyed.
Stoler had previously claimed to
have 2000 signatures on petitions
seeking the recall for Mathe's violation
of a senate by-law requiring fee as
sessment refunds to be handed out in
White Plaza.
Stoler said he was not submitting
the petition because he felt Mathe was
sufficiently apologetic for his actions.
Earlier in the meeting Mathe
explained he refused to hand out fee
assessment rebates in White Plaza for
security reasons.

He said two security guards would
be needed to safeguard distribution
of refunds in White Plaza. He esti
mated costs for distributing the re
funds would be increased from the
current $120 to $500 or $600.
Vouchers
The senate voted 11 -3 to suspend the
portion of the Jan. 23 resolution requir
ing Mathe to distribute the refunds in
White Plaza. The senators instructed
him instead to hand out in White Plaza
vouchers which students can ex
change for money at the ASSU office.
When the senators lit the petition on
fire, Mathe said the destruction of the
petitions before it could be examined
"proves the signatures are not real or
Stoler and King wouldn't have de
stroyed them."
He added he felt the reputations of
himself and Asst. Financial Manager
Miles White had been damaged by the
publicity.
'You're next'
Mathe said he did not think the
threatening phone calls and notes he
and White, had received were funny.
Mathe said White was eating at a
Chinese restaurant when a waiter pre
sented him with a fortune cookie in
scribed with the words "you're next."
"The whole thing got started
through an error in the Daily," Stoler
asserted. He said the Daily was al
legedly told there were "16 or 15 sig
natures" on the petition but the Daily
misunderstood and quoted Hammer &
Coffin as saying "1650."
Stoler said, after the story and edito
rial were printed, they decided to per
petuate the error. "It got started rather
innocently and we did our best to carry
it out. I think we've done quite well. I
will defend what we did," Stoler said.
'Ridiculous' charge
"Stoler's charge that the Daily was
inaccurate is ridiculous. I support our
reporter completely," said Bonny
Rodden, Daily editor.

"Stoler called me over the weekend
and said he and King had been 'disin
genuous' with the Daily. How can we
take Stoler's word over the word of a
reporter when Stoler admits to deceiv
ing the Daily and then goes on to de
ceive the student body by carrying on
with his game," she asked after the
meeting.
Ferguson said while he "some
times" appreciated the "levity" the
two senators have brought to the se
nate this year, he felt "this hoax inci
dent blackened the names of students
who tried to control the outflow of
monies for philosophical reasons and
not for personal vendettas."
No one laughing
Addressing Stoler and King, Fergu
son continued, "If you look around, 1
don't think anyone is laughing any
more except yourselves."
A motion to censure Stoler and King
was tabled indefinitely, 11-5.
At the meeting, the senate also voted
to ratify the results of last week's elec
tion. Sen. J.J. Chao suggested some
method be instituted to distinguish
senior class officer ballots from those
of the general student body.
The senate also voted 11-1 to pass a
resolution submitted by Bruce Parker,
member of Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
to "urge Stanford University to vote in
favor of the shareholder resolutions
which call for non-expansion and/or
withdrawal of South African invest
ments."
The meeting ended with a 6-3 vote
favoring the adoption of Ferguson's
resolution: "Be it resolved that the
ASSU Senate believes Stanford Uni
versity needs a return of cheerleaders
about as much as it needs more nerds,
and asks the Athletic Department and
others pushing for the return of this
convention to let this sleeping dog
lie."
Sen. Jim King set fire last night to a
petition seeking the recall of ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Chris Mathe after
