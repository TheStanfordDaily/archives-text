# 'Stanford' lingers in SRI's name
## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
More than two years have passed
since the Stanford Research Institution
(SRI) was supposed to remove "Stan
ford" from its name, but the change
# has yet to be made.
Separated from the University
January 13, 1970, SRI was given five
years to change its name to avoid in
ferences of connection with the Uni
versity. The Board of Trustees ex
tended the deadline to April 1, 1977.
According to Geoffrey Steel, general
counsel to SRI, the trustees "informally
extended" the deadline again for an
indefinite period.

"There has been informal discus
sion" of extension at trustees' meet
ings, said Provost William Miller, "but
no formal raising of the issue on the
agenda."
'No agreement'
"There has been no agreement to my
knowledge one way or another to fix a
definite time period," added Miller.
When questioned as to the reasons
for delay on the name change, Steel
replied, "We have run into a number of
technical problems, both with legal
aspects and from a corporation who
has initials identical to ours."
A small southern California insur
ance and real estate firm raised legal
objections in 1975 when SRI had at
tempted to use only its initials in its
name. The Stanford Real Estate and
Insurance of North Hollywood cur
rently uses the SRI acronym.
The legal tangle with the southern
California corporation prompted the
University trustees in December 1975
to grant the institute a two-year exten
sion of the time period.
Stanford affiliate
Originally a Stanford affiliate, SRI
was the target of extensive protests and
demonstrations by Stanford students
during 1969 for its Defense Depart
ment contracts. The April 3rd Move
ment (A3M), an organization of stu
dent political activists, demanded that
SRI cease all its chemical and biologi
cal warfare, counterinsurgency and
war-related research done there.
The militant A3M, which occupied

Encina Hall and staged a sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory for
nine days in April 1969, had de
manded that the University "integ
rate" SRI into Stanford for control by
students and professors.
While trustees said they "vigorously
endorse" a ban on research related to
biological and chemical warfare, they
put no condition on the termination of
SRI ties.
Rather than discontinue the re
search, the Board of Trustees voted to
make SRI an independent institution.
Discussion
Steel mentioned that over nine
months of discussions took place with
the southern California real estate
firm. "We had asked them about relin
quishing their name, but they disag
reed to it unless they could be paid a
substantial sum," said Steel. Steel
would not comment as to the figure of
that sum.
SRI has chosen a new name, "SRI
International," which the institute is
now going through legal processes to
acquire. According to Steel, "The Sec
retary of State of California at first was
not satisfied with the prospective new
name, feeling it was still too close to
the name of that other corporation, but
he has since then given his 0.K."
Steel said it would take only 30 to 60
days for the legal name change to take
effect.
Yet when asked why the name still
had not gone into effect after the ex-

piration of this deadline, Steel replied
"I was asked by the SRI board to hold

further elaborate on other possible
reasons for the delay.
"A lot of people are not expecially
anxious to see a name change, so
there's been no mad rush to do it,"
Steel added.

reasons for the delay.
"A lot of people are not expecially
anxious to see a name change, so
there's been no mad rush to do it,"
Steel added.
More than two years have passed
since the Stanford Research Institution
(SRI) was supposed to remove "Stan
ford" from its name, but the change
# has yet to be made.
Separated from the University
January 13, 1970, SRI was given five
years to change its name to avoid in
ferences of connection with the Uni
versity. The Board of Trustees ex
tended the deadline to April 1, 1977.
According to Geoffrey Steel, general
counsel to SRI, the trustees "informally
extended" the deadline again for an
indefinite period.

"There has been informal discus
sion" of extension at trustees' meet
ings, said Provost William Miller, "but
no formal raising of the issue on the
agenda."
'No agreement'
"There has been no agreement to my
knowledge one way or another to fix a
definite time period," added Miller.
When questioned as to the reasons
for delay on the name change, Steel
replied, "We have run into a number of
technical problems, both with legal
aspects and from a corporation who
has initials identical to ours."
A small southern California insur
ance and real estate firm raised legal
objections in 1975 when SRI had at
tempted to use only its initials in its
name. The Stanford Real Estate and
Insurance of North Hollywood cur
rently uses the SRI acronym.
The legal tangle with the southern
California corporation prompted the
University trustees in December 1975
to grant the institute a two-year exten
sion of the time period.
Stanford affiliate
Originally a Stanford affiliate, SRI
was the target of extensive protests and
demonstrations by Stanford students
during 1969 for its Defense Depart
ment contracts. The April 3rd Move
ment (A3M), an organization of stu
dent political activists, demanded that
SRI cease all its chemical and biologi
cal warfare, counterinsurgency and
war-related research done there.
The militant A3M, which occupied

Encina Hall and staged a sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory for
nine days in April 1969, had de
manded that the University "integ
rate" SRI into Stanford for control by
students and professors.
While trustees said they "vigorously
endorse" a ban on research related to
biological and chemical warfare, they
put no condition on the termination of
SRI ties.
Rather than discontinue the re
search, the Board of Trustees voted to
make SRI an independent institution.
Discussion
Steel mentioned that over nine
months of discussions took place with
the southern California real estate
firm. "We had asked them about relin
quishing their name, but they disag
reed to it unless they could be paid a
substantial sum," said Steel. Steel
would not comment as to the figure of
that sum.
SRI has chosen a new name, "SRI
International," which the institute is
now going through legal processes to
acquire. According to Steel, "The Sec
retary of State of California at first was
not satisfied with the prospective new
name, feeling it was still too close to
the name of that other corporation, but
he has since then given his 0.K."
Steel said it would take only 30 to 60
days for the legal name change to take
effect.
Yet when asked why the name still
had not gone into effect after the ex-
