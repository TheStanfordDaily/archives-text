## Support Band fee assessment 
### 
Rich Johnson

What do the following have in
common? 1) 1500 businessmen
gathered on Wall Street; 2) a stoned
Penn State student; 3) Mustang Ranch,
4) the U.S. Capitol; and 5) BoSchem
bechler.
Each has been victimized by the Le
land Stanford Junior University
Marching Band. Winding its way
through the lush beauty of Interstate
80, the LSJUMB has terrorized mill
ions of innocent bystanders with
cheers of "EMBO" and "Go Trees!"
Spreading the noble ideals of drugs,
sex and violence, the Incomparables
have Americans everywhere saying,
"Who are those guys, anyway?"
Marching into the nation's finest
stadiums in their now famous
amorphous blob formation, they have
convinced students and alums alike
that halftime is more than an exhibi
tion of trained penguins.
During the past five years, the Band
has played at more than 100 rallies for
fans from Lovelock, Nev., to Blueballs,
Pa., and any other place where mem
bers could grub a beer.
In addition to the Band itself, these
yearly invasions are notable because
they are funded solely by Stanford
students through fee assessments.
This student support is unique among
all college bands in the United States.
Nowhere has a band been so closely
tied to the spirit of its student body.
The LSJUMB is one of the few remain
ing institutions here at Stanford that
all students can enjoy.
But the future of the LSJUMB is in
doubt. Tomorrow and Thursday, the
fee assessment for the Band will ap
pear on the runoff ballot for senior
class officers. "So what?" you say.

"The Band always gets its fee assess
ment. Everyone likes the Band."
The fact is that unless Stanford stu
dents take on personal responsibility
for the Band, the assessment will fail. It
won't fail for reason of too many "no"
votes, but for reason of too many non
voters.
A voter turnout of 20 per cent of the
student population (2200) is necessary
to make the assessment results valid. If
last week's election turnout is any in
dication, the LSJUMB is in real trouble
and only you, the student, can save it.
It cannot be emphasized enough that
if you do not vote, your apathy will be
more effective than 10 votes against
the Band.
The effects of the Band's assessment
failure would go beyond the obvious
financial setback. Without student
funds, the Band loses its sense of self
sufficiency and direct responsibility to
the students. It becomes solely an arm
of the University subject to the limita
tions and bureaucracy of the administ
ration.
The Band will lose the major ele
ment that sets it apart from any other
band aroundâ€”its student support.
What will it take to avoid these un
wanted consequences? It will require
responsibility on the part of every stu
dent to take five minutes of his/her
time, cast a vote for the LSJUMB, and
save a part of what makes Stanford un
ique.
The Band is in trouble and needs
your help. Please vote tomorrow and
Thursday. There's more to Stanford
than "work, study and get rich."
