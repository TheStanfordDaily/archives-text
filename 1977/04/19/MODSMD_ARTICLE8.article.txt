## Senior class slates, South Africa 
### 
Sterling et al.
Sterling, Standing, Strike and Jones:
we're the "constructive workers with
crate ideas." But you can take us seri
ously as senior class candidates. We
want to spend a lot of time next year
providing our class with helpful ser
vices and fun activities.
In the last few weeks we've heard
from juniors suggesting events like
pre-football keggers and White Plaza
nooners. These are great additions to
the happy hours and two big social
events each quarter that we'd organize.
Our ideas include dances such as a
semi-formal evening in the City and
boat dance on the bay, sports like a day
on the green and old-fashioned spring
picnic, a senior snow skiing trip and a
talent show.
We've decided there is enough in
terest in our class (seven slates run
ning for office) to form a "Senior
Committee" made up of seniors who
want to help with class services and
events. We will also find one senior or
house associate (RA) in each residence
who will be responsible for distribut
ing senior newsletters twice each quar
ter.
We hope you know already how we
will carry out the officers' traditional
duties: holding a senior class vote on
the top five proposed commencement
speakers after seniors' registration day
suggestions and the administration's
input have been considered, sum
marizing CPPC and Alumni Contact
Service information valuable to

seniors and making Class of '78 direc
tories available at the beginning of the
year.
We want you to know too, that Peter
Jones is on our slate, although his
name isn't on the ballot. He received a
government job in Washington re
cently, which starts during spring
quarter, so he isn't registered now.
That's why his name isn't eligible for
the ballot even though he will be eligi
ble to serve as an officer next year
when he is once again registered.
In the past we have worked in such
positions as the social chairperson of
an eating club, RA of a freshman dorm,
president of a four-class dorm and
overseas campus social director. As a
senior class slate we have been to
gether since January, and as a group of
friends we work together well.
In the future, starting with the rest of
this quarter, we would like to be work
ing seriously for the fun of the next
senior class.

De Lapa et al.
You all know the issues: let's talk
about them. On the first issue: both
slates agree, but with some reserva
tion. On the second issue: our stand is

right, theirs is wrong; this point cannot
be argued. On the third issue: we're
wrong, they're right, but that shows
we're human. That's enough on the is
sues.
We're glad you're reading this â€”if
you weren't-, you might not vote for us,
and if you didn't vote for us, we'd most
likely lose. That would be discourag
ing because our parents always
wanted us to be senior class presi
dents. We can hear their words now:
"Kids, someday you're going to be
senior class presidents. Your stand on
the second issue is like no one else's."
Well, that day is near and we're pre
pared to meet the challenge. We're
ready to drink beer at the happy hours
(50 per cent of our slate is 21 or over).
We're ready to pick an intellectually
stimulating commencement speaker
(Did someone whisper, 'Billy Carter'?).
We're ready to go places no one has
gone to before (and if you're lucky,
we'll stay there.)
As must be obvious, we've had a
good time running our campaign.
We've enjoyed sitting out in White
Plaza, listening to bagpipes and guitar,
soaking up the sun, and, most of all,
talking to people. Our "off-the-wall"
attitude isn't indicative of any disre
gard for the seriousness of the office,
but simply is our way of approaching
this election.
We plan to continue having a good
time, and to make sure the senior class
has a good time also. For us, this means
doing a good job (and three out of four

of us think we can).
The job of senior class presidents re
quires time (ours), money (yours) and
organization (well, two out of three
isn't bad)..Yessiree Bob, we can make
confusion and we can work; ergo, we
can make confusion work. Q.E.D.

Worried?
If we're worried about a violent re
volt, we should remember the story
about a man treed by a bear. He im
plored: "Lord, please help me, but if
you can't help me, please don't help
that bear."
As long as we're propping up its
economy, South Africa can go ahead
arming itself and making only cosme
tic changes.
Bayers Narde, an Afrikaaner, head of
the Christian Institute in Johannes
burg, said: "End investments." Only
then will the South African govern
ment have to face reality and, as Assoc.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy pointed out, the U.S. govern
ment would then have no economic
interests to defend.
