# Thompson: a taste of 'Gonzo'
## 
### Jacob Young 
In the wake of Richard Nixon's
astounding victory in the 1972
presidential election, two remarka
ble books on the campaign ap
peared. One was The Boys on the
Bus by Timonthy Crouse. The other
was Fear and Loathing on the
Campaign Trail 1972, by Hunter S.
Thompson.
Both gave the "inside" story:
tales of endless lines, sleepless
nights and all-too-human candi
dates posing as saviors. Both were
in a new style, branded "new jour
nalism" by literary critics—a
strange mixture of stream of con
sciousness, fiction and old
fashioned political analysis.
But that was 1972. Before Water
gate, before Woodward and Berns
tein and before the journalist was
transformed into a white knight.
Thompson may no longer have a
special place in this world. Most
people have never heard of Fear
and Loathing (in Las Vegas or the
Campaign Trail). His peculiar style
of "gonzo" journalism has become
a fad; everyone else is in the act.
But Thompson surfaced briefly
here last night and gave the capac
ity crowd in Cubberley Auditorium

a taste of "gonzo," whether they
knew it or not.
Capacity was strictly the word.
The seats and aisles filled and from
7:30 p.m. until Thompson appeared
an hour later, people brought their
own folding chairs, hoping for
some empty aisle space.
During that restless hour, Bob
Moog and Dave Ford, both Stanford
Lovers of Unusual Trivia (SLUT),
kept the audience up by running
the highlight questions of last
week's Trivia Bowl by one more
time.
When he came on stage, there
was no apology for being late, no
claim to having much to say. For
Thompson, giving these speeches
is "bordering on the most bizarre
thing 1 could do." He promised not
to give a speech, but only to field
questions from the audience.
He promised a "hostile and an
tagonistic dialogue." None ever
emerged. Many of the inquiries were
in the vein of: who is your favorite
person (Peter Lorre, Idi Amin,
Khruschev). Not much room for
more than a stream of one-liners in
volving lots of drug references.
Thompson, through his former
employer, Rolling Stone, was one of

the first to solidly endorse Jimmy
Carter last spring. Rolling Stone
was perhaps responsible for carry
ing a good deal of its readership for
Carter as a result.
Thompson acknowledged he has
"some responsibility" for Carter's
victory, but added, "He's stuck with
me, I'm stuck with him; but he's
president."
He expressed fear, though, for the
"somber and solemn" tone of Car
ter's energy speech Monday night,
and said he feared "it was only a
warmup for Wednesday, which
will be a death knell." Carter is
scheduled to release details of his
energy conservaton plans today.
He also said he dreads the view of
recent years which journalists will
leave to history. Calling today's
journalism "mostly gossip,"
Thompson claims to have lost in
terest in journalism. He said he
would prefer to "rob liquor stores,
but people recognize me too eas
ily."
That was the tenor of the evening:
mostly fun, but deadly serious, too.
Thompson appeared uneasy sign
ing autographs and shaking hands
after it was all over.
He probably was.
