# Nationalize health care services
## 
### 
David Sartoris

One need only glance at the
daily newspaper to realize that
the present system of health care
in America is grossly in
adequate.
The malpractice issue remains
unsolved, costs continue to rise
and many patients are dissatis
fied with their physicians. It is
clear that the situation cannot
continue along its present
course and the trend toward
some form of organized national
health care has already man
ifested itself.
The controversial 1976 Na
tional Health Care Act, which
imposed strict restraints on med
ical schools in America is but
one recent example.
The pros and cons of
socialized medicine in this
country have been hotly debated
for some time. While opponents
tend to back their arguments
with the apparent failure of such
a plan in Britain, the advantages
of a well-organized American
system would be numerous.
Goals
Major goals would include a
more adequate geographical dis
tribution of doctors, quality
health care to all regardless of
economic status, training of a
larger number of physicians and
elimination of the currently
overloaded patient schedule
faced by many doctors.
A plan successful in meeting
these goals requires that the
physician's role in society be

equated with that of other public
service employes. A taxpayer
supported government salary
would eliminate the existing fi
nancial incentive for over
scheduling on the part of private
physicians, allowing more time
for the needs of each patient.
Less complaints regarding the
rushed, impersonal and non
caring manner of doctors would
also undoubtedly result.
In a public-oriented system,
the distribution problem might
be solved at the level of medical
school admissions. Individuals
who aspire to become police of
ficers, for example, usually do so
with the knowledge that, upon
completion of training, they will
be placed in a particular
(perhaps undesirable) area of the
city.
Commitment
Medical school applicants
might be required to make a
similar commitment, thus solv
ing the current problems of
numerous applications and as
sessment of applicant sincerity
faced by admissions commit
tees. A further improvement
might include public participa
tion in the evaluation of applic
ants; indeed, the patient is in a
better position to know what
constitutes a good doctor than
another physician.
The current physician shor
tage is obviously most directly
dealt with by increasing the
number of places in existing
medical schools, opening new
medical schools and facilitating
the return of qualified foreign
trained students.
However, more efficient use of
existing training facilities might
be made in several ways. At pre
sent, choice of a specialty is not
made until several years of learn
ing have been completed, much
of which will never be used by
the individual in practice. For

example, an extensive course in
cardiovascular physiology is
likely to be of little use to a der
matologist.
Tailoring programs
This point obviously does not
apply in more general areas such
as pediatrics, surgery and inter
nal medicine. Nevertheless, the
choice of a specialty prior to
medical school entrance would
allow tailoring of the individu
al's program to suit his/her par
ticular needs, with consequenmt
shortening of the duration of
medical training and the turning
out of a greater number of physi
cians per unit of time.
One might justly argue that
the average premedical student
lacks sufficient exposure to
know which area of medicine is
particularly appealing. How
ever, in a socialized system, the
luxury of choice might have to
be foregone in favor of the needs
of the public.
Medical schools could help
eliminate th current shortage of
primary care physicians, for
example, by preferentially ad
mitting those individuals with a
stated commitment to that par-

ticular specialty. Other means of
shortening the duration of medi
cal training are possible; North
western University Medical
School has been successful in
recent years with a six-year med
ical program for high school
graduates.
Thus, it is clear that a well
organized national health care
system is desirable as well as
feasible for America in the near
future. It must be emphasized
that such a plan, like any of
comparable magnitude, would
not be without its problems.
However, perhaps most impor
tantly, it would eliminate the
mistrust and animosity which
has developed between physi
cian and patient in recent years.
The simultaneous images of
the doctor as a cold, money
seeking capitalist and the pa
tient as a potential malpractice
suit are stifling to good will and
the healing process itself. Obvi
ously, failure to change this as
pect of the present situaton de
feats the purpose of the doctor
patient interaction.

One need only glance at the
daily newspaper to realize that
the present system of health care
in America is grossly in
adequate.
The malpractice issue remains
unsolved, costs continue to rise
and many patients are dissatis
fied with their physicians. It is
clear that the situation cannot
continue along its present
course and the trend toward
some form of organized national
health care has already man
ifested itself.
The controversial 1976 Na
tional Health Care Act, which
imposed strict restraints on med
ical schools in America is but
one recent example.
The pros and cons of
socialized medicine in this
country have been hotly debated
for some time. While opponents
tend to back their arguments
with the apparent failure of such
a plan in Britain, the advantages
of a well-organized American
system would be numerous.
Goals
Major goals would include a
more adequate geographical dis
tribution of doctors, quality
health care to all regardless of
economic status, training of a
larger number of physicians and
elimination of the currently
overloaded patient schedule
faced by many doctors.
A plan successful in meeting
these goals requires that the
physician's role in society be

equated with that of other public
service employes. A taxpayer
supported government salary
would eliminate the existing fi
nancial incentive for over
scheduling on the part of private
physicians, allowing more time
for the needs of each patient.
Less complaints regarding the
rushed, impersonal and non
caring manner of doctors would
also undoubtedly result.
In a public-oriented system,
the distribution problem might
be solved at the level of medical
school admissions. Individuals
who aspire to become police of
ficers, for example, usually do so
with the knowledge that, upon
completion of training, they will
be placed in a particular
(perhaps undesirable) area of the
city.
Commitment
Medical school applicants
might be required to make a
similar commitment, thus solv
ing the current problems of
numerous applications and as
sessment of applicant sincerity
faced by admissions commit
tees. A further improvement
might include public participa
tion in the evaluation of applic
ants; indeed, the patient is in a
better position to know what
constitutes a good doctor than
another physician.
The current physician shor
tage is obviously most directly
dealt with by increasing the
number of places in existing
medical schools, opening new
medical schools and facilitating
the return of qualified foreign
trained students.
However, more efficient use of
existing training facilities might
be made in several ways. At pre
sent, choice of a specialty is not
made until several years of learn
ing have been completed, much
of which will never be used by
the individual in practice. For

example, an extensive course in
cardiovascular physiology is
likely to be of little use to a der
matologist.
Tailoring programs
This point obviously does not
apply in more general areas such
as pediatrics, surgery and inter
nal medicine. Nevertheless, the
choice of a specialty prior to
medical school entrance would
allow tailoring of the individu
al's program to suit his/her par
ticular needs, with consequenmt
shortening of the duration of
medical training and the turning
out of a greater number of physi
cians per unit of time.
One might justly argue that
the average premedical student
lacks sufficient exposure to
know which area of medicine is
particularly appealing. How
ever, in a socialized system, the
luxury of choice might have to
be foregone in favor of the needs
of the public.
Medical schools could help
eliminate th current shortage of
primary care physicians, for
example, by preferentially ad
mitting those individuals with a
stated commitment to that par-

ticular specialty. Other means of
shortening the duration of medi
cal training are possible; North
