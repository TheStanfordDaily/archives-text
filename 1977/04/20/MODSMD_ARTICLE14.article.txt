Here it is, spring quarter of
senior year, and I'm ready to
party with my fellow seniors. I
seem to recall that there are
senior class officers responsible
for providing a time and place to
do so.
Where the hell are they and
what the hell have they been do
ing? Outside of one keg at the
chem gazebo, I have heard of no
thing. But it is possible there
have been functions that I just
didn't hear about.
So, could you please find out
what senior activities are plan
ned for the rest of the spring? If
they need suggestions, I'd like to
see beer and hand in White Plaza
on a sunny Friday afternoon.
The door is closing on our
Stanford undergraduacy and I
think we should all stagger out
together. Just tell me when and
where, and I'll be there.

Hey, your senior class officers
are hard at work planning ac
tivities for the rest of the quarter.
According to Senior Class
President Dave Treinis, your
suggestion has already been im
plemented. Beer and band ap
peared in White Plaza autumn
quarter, marking the first time
such a function had appeared.
Treinis said other activities
planned for this quarter include:
—a full-moon party for May 3
in the Quad. Of course, kissing
would abound at the stroke of
midnight;
—a senior no-talent show on
May 26 in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. This will be an all
campus event;
—a possible pool party at de-
Guerre. Two bands would be
stationed within the complex
and beer would be served nearby
(not within the pool complex it
self). This would take place
sometime in the afternoon;
—a minimum of four Zot's
happy hours; and
—Senior Class Day. This is a
luncheon the Saturday before
graduation and many senior ac
tivities, such as the presentation
of the senior gift and time cap

sule contents, occur then.
Keep your eyes open so you
don't miss any of these great
events. And if you have any
questions or comments, just give
Dave Treinis a call. He's got a lot
planned, and if anyone should
know what's happening, he
should.

Can you help on water conser
vation? The shower in Room
5029 in the basement of the Med
ical Center has a peculiar faucet
such that hot water can only be
obtained by running the water at
a very excessive flow rate.
Can you contact Plant Ser
vices to get this corrected?
Also, would you please pub
lish the name and phone
number of who to contact should
other people find similar
water-wasting situations on
campus?

What can be done about the
squeaky seats in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium? The Ticketron
computer selected one of these
seats for me for a recent concert.

I couldn't move or breathe for
two hours for fear of causing a
disturbance.
After the performance, I in
spected the underside of the seat
to see if I should come armed
with an oil can in the future.
There didn't seem to be any way
to oil the innards.
Thank you for addressing
your attention to this problem.

For problems at the Medical
Center, call Maintenance at
497-5555. I've already called
them concerning the shower.
For facilities on campus, the
place to call is Work Control
Center at Facilities and Plan
ning. The number is 497-2281. If
you find a squeaky seat in Din
kelspiel, call this number and
report which seat is bad. They
will take care of it.
Something "bugging you"?
