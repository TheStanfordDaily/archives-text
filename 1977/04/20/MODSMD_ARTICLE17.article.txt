# Environmentalists fight for rivers
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) —Environmentalists
are fighting a rear guard action to prevent
California's last free-flowing rivers from be
coming casualties of the state's drought.
Bolstered by two years of drought, a coali
tion of farming, labor and business interests
is trying to overturn the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act, the law that prevents the dam
ming of the rivers.
The act's opponents say dams would store
water that would ease the effects of future
dry years. But environmentalists say there
are less costly and less damaging ways to
expand the water supply.
"The idea that you can continue to modify
the natural system is a very serious one,"
said John Zierold, a Sierra Club lobbyist.
"When you dam up these rivers you threaten
life support systems, like estuaries, which
have both biological and economic value."
The controversy revolves around a 1972
law which bans dams on the north coast's
Smith, Klamath and Trinity rivers and their
tributaries and parts of the American River
near Sacramento.
Moratorium
The act also placed a 12-year moratorium
on the planning or building of dams on a
fifth north coast river system, the Eel.
Environmentalists contend the act's foes
have never lost interest in building dams on
the rivers, and the author of a bill to repeal
the act says the drought has made repeal a
possibility.
"If we don't do it now, I suppose we never
will," said Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino). "In
wet years no one is concerned."
Ayala's bill would repeal the act and re
quire the state to preserve free-flowing rivers
"to the extent feasible" considering the envi
ronment and "health, safety, welfare and
sustenance of the people."

It has backing, he says, from business,
labor and agricultural interests.
"1 think it's morally wrong to allow water
to flow out to sea simply because someone
wants to preserve the environment when at
the same time agriculture is facing a $3 bill
ion to $4 billion loss because of a lack of
water," he said.
Conservation
But environmentalists say that Ayala's
position ignores the problems that dam
building causes, and stress that must of the
state's water shortage could be alleviated
through conservation.
"There is a General Accounting Office re
port that shows that out of the water the
Bureau of Reclamation sends to farmers, 50
per cent of it is wasted through bad irrigation
techniques," said Mark Dubois, director of
Friends of the River.
Much of that water could be saved by lin
ing irrigation ditches or using sprinkler irri
gation systems instead of the more common
method of flooding irrigation ditches, he
said.
To the environmentalists, free-flowing
rivers have benefits that range from
economic to spiritual.
"I really find it difficult to put into words
the value of free-flowing rivers," said
Dubois. "There is a real magic that ought to
be preserved for future generations to
touch."
Spawning grounds
Dams also cut off salmon and steelhead
from spawning grounds, which if done in
too many places could mean extinction for
the fish, says Sen. Peterßehr(R-Tiburon),au
thor of the wild rivers act.
And environmentalists contend that dams
threaten estuaries, where much of the nutri
tion for commercial fish is generated.

Actually, only the Smith is completely
free of dams. The other north coast rivers
have headwater dams but are free-flowing
for most of their lengths. The American has
two dams near Folsom, but has free-flowing
stretches above and below them.
Environmentalists have been pushing to
include the five rivers in the federal wild
rivers system, which would give them more
protection, although Behr says federal dam
builders honor the state law.
But state water officials say they want to
include the wild rivers issue in an overall
federal water legislation package.
They say that introduction of the package
is being held up as they try to hammer out
compromises between conservationists and
other interests.
Legal dispute
There is also a legal dispute involved in
the controversy. Ayala has obtained an opin
ion from legislative counsel which says the
wild rivers act cannot block dam construc
tion on the Eel, Trinity or Van Duzen River,
an Eel tributary.
The opinion is based on a 1960 bond act
which said funds should be spent for
facilities that state officials "deem neces
sary" to meet water needs. To do that, the
state was authorized to build dams in the
water sheds of the Eel, Trinity and Klamath
rivers, among others.
Ayala contends the bond act takes prece
dence over the wild rivers act because the
bond act was approved by voters. Behr dis
agrees, saying the point is moot since the
bond money has been spent.
The conservationists have a powerful ally
in Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., who said in a
recent interview that he opposes repeal of
the act.

threaten estuaries, where much of the nutri
tion for commercial fish is generated.

Actually, only the Smith is completely
free of dams. The other north coast rivers
have headwater dams but are free-flowing
for most of their lengths. The American has
two dams near Folsom, but has free-flowing
stretches above and below them.
Environmentalists have been pushing to
include the five rivers in the federal wild
rivers system, which would give them more
protection, although Behr says federal dam
builders honor the state law.
But state water officials say they want to
include the wild rivers issue in an overall
federal water legislation package.
They say that introduction of the package
is being held up as they try to hammer out
compromises between conservationists and
other interests.
Legal dispute
There is also a legal dispute involved in
the controversy. Ayala has obtained an opin
ion from legislative counsel which says the
wild rivers act cannot block dam construc
tion on the Eel, Trinity or Van Duzen River,
an Eel tributary.
The opinion is based on a 1960 bond act
which said funds should be spent for
facilities that state officials "deem neces
sary" to meet water needs. To do that, the
state was authorized to build dams in the
water sheds of the Eel, Trinity and Klamath
rivers, among others.
Ayala contends the bond act takes prece
dence over the wild rivers act because the
bond act was approved by voters. Behr dis
agrees, saying the point is moot since the
bond money has been spent.
The conservationists have a powerful ally
in Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., who said in a
recent interview that he opposes repeal of
the act.
Sacramento (AP) —Environmentalists
are fighting a rear guard action to prevent
California's last free-flowing rivers from be
coming casualties of the state's drought.
Bolstered by two years of drought, a coali
tion of farming, labor and business interests
is trying to overturn the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act, the law that prevents the dam
ming of the rivers.
The act's opponents say dams would store
water that would ease the effects of future
dry years. But environmentalists say there
are less costly and less damaging ways to
expand the water supply.
"The idea that you can continue to modify
the natural system is a very serious one,"
said John Zierold, a Sierra Club lobbyist.
"When you dam up these rivers you threaten
life support systems, like estuaries, which
have both biological and economic value."
The controversy revolves around a 1972
law which bans dams on the north coast's
Smith, Klamath and Trinity rivers and their
tributaries and parts of the American River
near Sacramento.
Moratorium
The act also placed a 12-year moratorium
on the planning or building of dams on a
fifth north coast river system, the Eel.
Environmentalists contend the act's foes
have never lost interest in building dams on
the rivers, and the author of a bill to repeal
the act says the drought has made repeal a
possibility.
"If we don't do it now, I suppose we never
will," said Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino). "In
wet years no one is concerned."
Ayala's bill would repeal the act and re
quire the state to preserve free-flowing rivers
"to the extent feasible" considering the envi
ronment and "health, safety, welfare and
sustenance of the people."

It has backing, he says, from business,
labor and agricultural interests.
"1 think it's morally wrong to allow water
to flow out to sea simply because someone
wants to preserve the environment when at
the same time agriculture is facing a $3 bill
ion to $4 billion loss because of a lack of
water," he said.
Conservation
But environmentalists say that Ayala's
position ignores the problems that dam
building causes, and stress that must of the
state's water shortage could be alleviated
through conservation.
"There is a General Accounting Office re
port that shows that out of the water the
Bureau of Reclamation sends to farmers, 50
per cent of it is wasted through bad irrigation
techniques," said Mark Dubois, director of
Friends of the River.
Much of that water could be saved by lin
ing irrigation ditches or using sprinkler irri
gation systems instead of the more common
method of flooding irrigation ditches, he
said.
To the environmentalists, free-flowing
rivers have benefits that range from
economic to spiritual.
"I really find it difficult to put into words
the value of free-flowing rivers," said
Dubois. "There is a real magic that ought to
be preserved for future generations to
touch."
Spawning grounds
Dams also cut off salmon and steelhead
from spawning grounds, which if done in
too many places could mean extinction for
the fish, says Sen. Peterßehr(R-Tiburon),au
thor of the wild rivers act.
