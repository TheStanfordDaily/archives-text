### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
clobbered the UC-Davis Aggies
16-4 yesterday afternoon at
Davis. The non-league victory
brings the Cards' record to 37-14
for the season, but they remain
only 2-7 in league play.
Stanford wielded powerful
bats against Davis in the one
sided contest, and head coach
Mark Marquess said he was
pleased with the outcome.
Sophomore righthander Brian
Harrison turned in another good
performance for the Cardinals
picking up his eighth win of the
season.
The Cards started the game on
the right foot, scoring one run in
the top of the first inning. Pepe
Hinojosa doubled, moved over
to third base and scored on a
hard-hit ground ball by Mike
Codiroli.
The Aggies answered in the
bottom of the inning with two
runs, giving Stanford starter Rob
Irwin trouble, but Irwin settled
down and brought things under
control before too much damage
occurred.
Stanford tied the game in the
third inning scoring one un
earned run. The score remained
knotted at 2-2 until the sixth in
ning when the Cards split the
game wide open.
In the sixth the Cardinals
scored 10 runs on walks, key
Base hits and a grand slam by
catcher Bruce Walters.
Stanford started its big inning
when Kevin Triggs walked,
Dave Perez singled and Walters
sent Triggs home on a sacrifice

bunt that the Davis pitcher threw
away. After Pepe Hinojosa
struck out, Todd Krvin walked to
load the bases arid a sacrifice fly
by Codiroli scored Perez.
Randy Wong then walked to
load the bases once again and
Tom Guardino singled Walters
home. Gary Scott walked in
Ervin for Stanford's fourth run,
and an infield single by Triggs
scored Wong.
Perez then singled Guardino

home, leaving the bases loaded.
Sophomore Walters then step
ped up to the plate and belted a
grand slam home run to clear the
bases.
The Cards scored four more
runs in the eighth inning, three
of them unearned, to add insult
to injury. Davis fought back in a
last-ditch effort in the bottom of
the ninth adding two runs and
leaving Davis 12 runs short.
