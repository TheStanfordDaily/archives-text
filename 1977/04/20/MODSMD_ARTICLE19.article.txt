# Men, women head south
## Stanford netters seek Ojai crown 
### Jill Lieber 
"You can't judge the season by
one weekend," said Card tennis
coach Dick Gould yesterday. "If
in order to win everyone needs
to be emotionally high for each
match, then we can't say we've got
a better team than UCLA or 'SC."
Stanford's men's and women's
tennis teams compete in the Ojai
Intercollegiates Thursday
through Sunday. The Cards take
on Cal, UCLA and USC in the
four-team tourney.
Each men's team will enter six
singles players and three dou
bles teams in the 24-singles, 12
doubles draw. Top-seeded in
singles is USC's Bruce Manson,
followed by Bruin Ferdi Taygan
and the Cards' Matt Mitchell and
Bill Maze.
The men are coming off a 6-3
win over UCLA and a 7-2
triumph over USC. Three weeks
ago, the Cards edged Cal, 5-4,
without the help of Perry Wright
at the No. 3 singles spot.
UCLA is favored to win the
Ojai tournament and Gould
thinks that the Bruins will also
be rated No. 1 by the nation's
college coaches even though the
Cards beat them Thursday.
Who's the best?
"UCLA has only lost one
match this year," the Card men

tor said. "We've lost three. Last
Thursday we just barely won
two of our matches, 7-6, in the
third set. We found out that we
are capable of beating UCLA, but
we aren't going to have a home
court advantage again. It really
helps to have people up here
pulling for you."
Gould is not pessimistic about
the Ojai matches. He just doesn't
want to blow the wins over the
nation's No. 1 and No. 3 tennis
teams last weekend out of prop
ortion.
"Ojai is going to be tough," he
said. "We've got three key
matches right off the bat. Jimmy
Hodges meets Cal's No. 1 man
Cary Stansbury, who he beat 7-6
in the third set in the Nor Cals in
March. And since then,
Stansbury has beaten Manson
and Taygan.
"Lloyd Bourne meets Cal's No.
3 man, Chris Dunk, who has not
lost a match all year. And Johnny
Rast meets 'SC's Buzz Strode,
who's a hot and cold player."
Mitchell, Perry Wright and
Maze all have first-round byes.
Four biggies
Gould said he has confidence
inall of his players and added he
was especially pleased with four
of last weekend's matches:

—Maze showed he could stay
"cool" in his indoor victory over
Bruin frosh Van Winitsky, 6-4,
6-3. Maze avenged his embaras
sing 3-6, 4-6 loss to Winitsky
down in Los Angeles.
—The win at the No. 6 spot by
freshman Hodges over UCLA's
Jon Paley, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0, promp
ted Gould to say that he is very
happy with the "super" jobs this
year's freshmen are doing. )ust
two weeks ago, Paley killed
Hodges, 1-6, 3-6.
—Bourne beat USC netter
Charles Strode, 6-2, 6-4, after los
ing a heartbreaker, 1-6, 6-1, 4-6,
in Los Angeles.
—The No. 2 doubles duo of
Maze and Rast defeated Bruce
Nichols and John Austin of
UCLA, 6-1, 1-6, 7-6 (5-2) Thurs
day after suffering a 2-6, 4-6 loss
in Los Angeles.
"Right now I'd vote for UCLA
to be the No. 1 team in the coun
try," Gould said when asked
about the upcoming coaches'
rating. "I'd rank us second. Trin
ity third and USC fourth. But it
we win Ojai, I'll change my
vote."
Women's competition
Representing the Cards in the
women's division will be Susie
Hagey and Diane Morrison in

singles and the doubles team of
Pat Varga and Nancy Anderson.
Barb Jordan, who has been out of
action the past month, was plan
ning to return to action in the
doubles competition, but coach
Anne Hill says it is doubtful she
will compete.
Junior Nancy Rudd is entered
in the open competition of the
Ojai tournament.
The women lost two down
south to UCLA and USC over the
weekend, but both Hill and
Gould said good things came out
of their 5-4 loss to the Bruins and
the 7-2 trouncingby theTrojans.
"The women felt they went
down there and didn't do any
worse than the men did down
there," said Gould. "They've got
the caliber to come back. They
just need consistency and dedi
cation."
"Susie and Diane had pretty
good weekends," Hill said.
Hagey upset defending AIAW
champion Barb Halquist of
USC, 6-1, 6-3. Morrison beat
Susan Zaro of UCLA, 6-1, 6-1.
"They'll both be right in the
thick of things this weekend,"
said Hill.
The women finished second
last year.
