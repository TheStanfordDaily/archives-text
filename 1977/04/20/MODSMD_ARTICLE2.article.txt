# Lyman discusses protest

### Kurt Cobb 
It is "a little unlikely" the University
will take action against protesters who
blocked the entrance to the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) April 12, President Richard
Lyman said last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
Lyman added, though, that he had
not received any recommendation on
the matter from James Siena, legal ad
viser to the president.
Lyman said demonstrators on cam
pus should avoid the misconception
that "you haven't committed a crime
unless someone warns you you are
committing one."
He made the point in response to
protestors who have said they were not
asked to cease their blockade by public
safety officers before the officers led a
marine recruiter through the protes
ters.
All facts
Lyman added that he does not know
all facts about the incident, but said
Marvin Herrington, director of public
safety, had indicated he was coming
through the crowd before doing so.
The president also was asked about
the Board of Trustees' decision to abs
tain on six shareholder proxies dealing
with investments in South Africa by
companies which the University holds
shares in.
The trustees did not agree with the
resolutions' call for either no further
investment in South Africa or divest
ment, Lyman said. But, he said, the
trustees also did not feel it was approp
riate to vote with management against
the resolutions.
The abstentions
Lyman pointed out that the board is
sending letters to each company, exp
laining the meaning of the abstentions.
The trustees certainly favor equality
among the peoples of South Africa,
Lyman said, but he said he did not see
what good companies would do by
"pulling out of the situation."
Lyman said student protesters are ef
fective to the extent that they bring
attention to issues that might other
wise be neglected.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
will receive a thorough review by Pro
vost William Miller of the facts in her
tenure case, Lyman said. Bern was re
cently denied tenure by Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Royden.
