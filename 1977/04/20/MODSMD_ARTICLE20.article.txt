## Athletic anxieties 
### Jill Lieber 
Golfer Dave Stockton was asked at the start of
the Masters' tournament a few years ago to
name the player he most feared in that field of
golfing greats.
"Me," he answered without hesitation.
Athletic competition makes great mental
demands because the quick formulation and
execution of strategies are necessary. You must
remember and formulate all the basic
mechanics of your sport.
The rules, strategies, assessments of the
abilities of yourself and your opponents,
weather and the condition of the facilities must
be synthesized to make the correct response to
the pressure situation.
Anxieties, however, make these mental oper
ations difficult. They can easily distract you
from all the things you must keep in mind.
"In any sport you're dealing not only with the
pressure of the competition," said No. 1 Cardi
nal tennis player Matt Mitchell, "but an athlete
must deal with the challenge inside himself.
He's got to be able to handle himself emotion
ally so all his physical abilities can come out in
the end."
The brain picks up physiological manifesta
tions of anxiety — rapid heartbeat, nausea,
shortness of breath. These uncomfortable feel
ings are psychologically alarming and add
more mental distress, causing the heart rateto
climb even higher.
You get down on yourself when you miss an
easy shot in tennis. The physical manifestations
set in and make you irritable. When the next
shot comes up your emotions rule your effort
and you slam the ball — probably out, which
makes you even more mad.
"It's tough for any player to go out on the
courts and be tough everytime — and know that
he's there," said Mitchell. "If you can psych
yourself and not mentally sap yourself, then
you'll be a top-level player."
Stanford's top golfer Mike Peck said, "Most
people realize that golf is a mental game and
depends on self-confidence. When the pros
stand over the ball they think about how well
they'll hit it. But I think of how 1 don't want to

hit it and worry that I won't hit it right."
"You can talk yourself into anything you
want to," said two-time Olympic gold medalist
Mike Bruner. "How well you do depends on
your mental attitude — if it's positive or nega
tive — because everybody is just as good physi
cally."
Anxieties stemming from emotional relation
ships also have a prominent effect on athletic
performances. Freud argued that the energies of
creation are finite. Whether the act of creation
be child bearing, refining an emotional rela
tionship, the advancement of civilization or
perfecting an athletic performance, any energy
channeled away from that given act of creation
— artistic, athletic or scientific — is lost.
Therefore, for an athlete to reach the peak in
his performance, Freud said, a singleminded
channeling of his energies is required. If 50 per
cent of an athlete's energy goes into his social
life, that same 50 per cent is lost for his athletic
performance. And in the world of sports, less
than 100 per cent effort means losing.
"If you don't shut out girl friend problems
when you're competing," said Bruner, "you'll
lose. Going into a meet you can forget about
everything but the race — in your conscious
mind — but not in your subconscious."
"If relationships aren't frustrating and
academics aren't a grind, then athletics are not
confining," said swimmer Anne Brodell. "To a
point you can block out emotional problems
because in a meet, swimming is your job and
nothing else exists."
"Girls can affect my playing if things are
going badly," said freshman netter Peter Re
nnert. "The life of a tennis player is not condu
cive to having long-term relationships. You're
away a long time playing tournaments and
when you come home you feel differently.
People can't understand.
"Not having a long-term relationships has
been a sacrifice but I'm willing to make it. I want
to be a tennis player and I've got to work hard
now when I'm young. Right now I'd rather have
my life be tennis than girls."

been a sacrifice but I'm willing to make it. I want
to be a tennis player and I've got to work hard
now when I'm young. Right now I'd rather have
my life be tennis than girls."
Golfer Dave Stockton was asked at the start of
the Masters' tournament a few years ago to
name the player he most feared in that field of
golfing greats.
"Me," he answered without hesitation.
Athletic competition makes great mental
demands because the quick formulation and
execution of strategies are necessary. You must
remember and formulate all the basic
mechanics of your sport.
The rules, strategies, assessments of the
abilities of yourself and your opponents,
weather and the condition of the facilities must
be synthesized to make the correct response to
the pressure situation.
Anxieties, however, make these mental oper
ations difficult. They can easily distract you
from all the things you must keep in mind.
"In any sport you're dealing not only with the
pressure of the competition," said No. 1 Cardi
nal tennis player Matt Mitchell, "but an athlete
must deal with the challenge inside himself.
He's got to be able to handle himself emotion
ally so all his physical abilities can come out in
the end."
The brain picks up physiological manifesta
tions of anxiety — rapid heartbeat, nausea,
shortness of breath. These uncomfortable feel
ings are psychologically alarming and add
more mental distress, causing the heart rateto
climb even higher.
You get down on yourself when you miss an
easy shot in tennis. The physical manifestations
set in and make you irritable. When the next
shot comes up your emotions rule your effort
and you slam the ball — probably out, which
makes you even more mad.
"It's tough for any player to go out on the
courts and be tough everytime — and know that
he's there," said Mitchell. "If you can psych
yourself and not mentally sap yourself, then
you'll be a top-level player."
Stanford's top golfer Mike Peck said, "Most
people realize that golf is a mental game and
depends on self-confidence. When the pros
stand over the ball they think about how well
they'll hit it. But I think of how 1 don't want to

hit it and worry that I won't hit it right."
"You can talk yourself into anything you
want to," said two-time Olympic gold medalist
Mike Bruner. "How well you do depends on
your mental attitude — if it's positive or nega
tive — because everybody is just as good physi
cally."
Anxieties stemming from emotional relation
ships also have a prominent effect on athletic
performances. Freud argued that the energies of
creation are finite. Whether the act of creation
be child bearing, refining an emotional rela
tionship, the advancement of civilization or
perfecting an athletic performance, any energy
channeled away from that given act of creation
— artistic, athletic or scientific — is lost.
Therefore, for an athlete to reach the peak in
his performance, Freud said, a singleminded
channeling of his energies is required. If 50 per
cent of an athlete's energy goes into his social
life, that same 50 per cent is lost for his athletic
performance. And in the world of sports, less
than 100 per cent effort means losing.
"If you don't shut out girl friend problems
when you're competing," said Bruner, "you'll
lose. Going into a meet you can forget about
everything but the race — in your conscious
mind — but not in your subconscious."
"If relationships aren't frustrating and
academics aren't a grind, then athletics are not
confining," said swimmer Anne Brodell. "To a
point you can block out emotional problems
because in a meet, swimming is your job and
nothing else exists."
"Girls can affect my playing if things are
going badly," said freshman netter Peter Re
nnert. "The life of a tennis player is not condu
cive to having long-term relationships. You're
away a long time playing tournaments and
when you come home you feel differently.
People can't understand.
"Not having a long-term relationships has
been a sacrifice but I'm willing to make it. I want
to be a tennis player and I've got to work hard
now when I'm young. Right now I'd rather have
