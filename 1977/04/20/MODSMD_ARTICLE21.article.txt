## 
### 
Starting amid a pack of 2993
runners that assembled Monday
in rural Hopkinton for the 81st
running of the Boston Marathon.
1976 Stanford graduate Chris
Berka finished the gruelling
26-mile. 385-vard ordeal in
eighth place, having covered the
undulating route in 2:19:48.
Canadian Jerome Drayton, a
32-year-old runner from To
ronto, broke the finish tape in
downtown Boston in 2:14:46 to
win the prestigious event.

Berka, running for the West
Valley Track Club, finished
nearly a minute ahead of the next
runner, Jack Fultz, the 1976
winner of the Boston race.
In last year's U.S. Olympic
marathon trial in Eugene, Ore.,
Berka finished 21st in 2:22:56.
The 23-year-old runner was
hurt after the Olympic trial and
told Stanford cross country
coach Marshall Clark that he was
considering giving up running.
Fortunately, he scrapped

thoughts of a premature retire
ment.
"He trains himself, and he
trains himself hard," Clark said.
Berka runs on Sundays with a
group that at various times in
cludes Olympian Paul Geis; Ron
Wayne, the fourth-place finisher
in Monday's race; Stanford har
rier Roy Kissin.and former Stan
ford distance great Sandoval.
The Sunday runs are reportedly
of a very competitive nature.
Apparently, they also paid off.
