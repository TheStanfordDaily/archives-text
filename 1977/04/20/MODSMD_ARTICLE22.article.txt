# Two prep cagers sign with Cards
## 
### Chris Baker 
Jeff Ryan and Peter Lallas
had their minds made up even
before they signed national
letters of intent to attend
Stanford—they wanted to
spend four years playing bas
ketball on the Farm.
Lallas, a 6-foot-l guard from
Eugene, Ore., told the Eugene
Register-Guard in February
that he was going to come
here.
Ryan, a 6-7 forward from
Winnetka, 111., visited Rice,
Northwestern and Rollins
College, but he was sure that
this was the place for him.
"I sort of had my mind set
on coming here," Ryan said in
a telephone interview yester
day."I just wanted to make
sure. A major reason for com
ing here is that I place
academics above basketball."
Alumni brat
Lallas' father did some
graduate work here. He is now
executive dean at the Univer
sity of Oregon. Lallas' brother
attended law school here and
his sister is a first-year student
at the business school.
Lallas was not heavily re
cruited by Oregon or Oregon
State. A Eugene sports writer
said Oregon didn't go for Lai

las because he doesn't play
Oregon-style defense.
"Oregon and Oregon State
really didn't recruit me," said
Lallas. "A lot of people re
spect my decision (some
Oregonians feel that athletes
are as valuable as natural re
sources).
"I talked to the Oregon
coach, but my first choice was
Stanford. I attended the bas
ketball camp at Stanford last

summer and I got a chance to
meet the coaching staff."
Scoring champ
Lallas beat out crosstown
rival Dan Ainge, a prep All-
American, to win the league
scoring title with a 24.3 aver
age. Ainge averaged 23.8
points per contest.
Lallas, a three-time All-
District pick, led the District
SAAA League in scoring his
junior and senior seasons.

"He can do all the things
that are necessary," said assis
tant coach Rob Frederick.
"Lallas has got very good
quickness and he's a fine
shooter."
All-Chicago
Ryan, a two-time All-
Suburban Chicago forward,
averaged 19 points and 11 re
bounds per game for New
Trier East High School. He
scored 41 points and pulled
down 20 boards in a state reg
ional playoff game. In that
contest he set a tournament
record, hitting 20 of 29 field
goal attempts.
Frederick, who saw that
record-setting perfomance,
said. "We think he'll be a fine
outside shooter." Ryan
should give the Cards needed
outside shooting punch.
Though the forward spot
looks settled next year, with
Kimberly Helton and George
Schader returning, Ryan will
be content with his reserve
role.
"I just want to make a good
contribution to the team next
year. It will probably take me a
while to adjust," said Ryan.
Challenge
But the 6-7 forward looks
positively at the challenge

that playing in the Pacific-8
will present. "I'm real excited
about playing in the Pac-8. It's
an excellent league. I think it
will help me improve."
Lallas said that the fact that
Stanford hasn't had a winning
cage season since 1972-73
didn't bother him. "I don't
think you can judge a basket
ball program by its win-loss
record," he said.
Lallas and Ryan are the first
two recruits to announce they
are coming to Stanford. More
signings are expected before
the end of the month.
In other recruiting news
from around the
conference —The Los Angeles
Times reported Saturday that
Albert King, the nation's most
sought-after cage prospect,
has narrowed it down to
Arizona State and Maryland.
UCLA was making a big effort
to land King.
Washington State master
recruiter and coach George
Raveling has signed Tim Jan
kovich, a 6-1 All-State guard
from Kansas, and Dennis
Smith, a 6-5, 210-pound
sophomore from Saddleback
J.C. Raveling calls Smith "as
good a jumper as Harold
Rhodes."
