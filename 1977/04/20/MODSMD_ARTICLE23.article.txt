# Peter Rennert: 'I'll always be a New Yorker'

Freshman netter Peter Rennert is New
York through and through. The Great
Neck accent, the shoulder-length thick
wavy hair, the love for popular East Coast
sports such as lacrosse and hockey and the
bright-colored Lacoste shirts reveal Re
nnert's New York upbringing.
"You're so typically New York," I said
to Rennert in the middle of our interview
Monday night.
He blushed proudly. His eyes grew
large and his voice was excited, imagin
ing he'd found an East Coast comrade.
"I've got my New York breeding — the
stereotypical pushy, obnoxious New
Yorker," he said. "When you first get to
college you don't have any reputations.
But after a month or so here everyone
starts to act just like they did in high
school. You can't change your upbring
ing or your personality."
Rennert's friends back home envied the
fact he would be going to school in
California.
Blonde beauties
"The Easterner has a picture of Califor
nia girls. My friends all said, 'Wow, all
those blondes. Are you lucky.' What they
didn't realize is that I like brunettes.
"In December my family moved to Be
verly Hills. At last week's matches Dick
(Gould) introduced me to the crowd say
ing I was from Beverly Hills. I wished
he'd said I was from Great Neck. I love
being a New Yorker."
Rennert grew up with East Coast tennis
which he said was beneficial to the de
velopment of his well-rounded game. By
playing tennis in the East he played on all
types of surfaces, including clay. There
fore he is not strong on just one surface.
Rennert also was exposed to East Coast
players such as the noted transsexual
Renee Richards.
He to she
"I knew Richard Raskin when she was a
him," Rennert said. "We played together
at my tennis club. He is a good friend of
the family. He never had much facial hair
and when I was young I thought it was
sort of weird. Then I realized it was his
makeup.
"My mother went out to dinner with
him after the operation. I guess it was

good for him psychologically. He's more
at home with himself. It's still sort of
weird though. How would you like to see
someone in the same locker room with
you who used to use the other locker
room?"
Rennert decided to leave his home soil
and venture West for college. At the
Southern and Midwestern schools which
contacted him he knew he would've been
near the top of the team ladder but he
realized he wouldn't have advanced in
tennis or life.
"I was recruited by UCLA, USC and
Stanford. UCLA had no scholarships
open and I knew I'd only be a number
there. USC had no grass — there was no
green. But Stanford was beautiful and I
felt wanted.
"College tennis is big and Stanford is
the best as far as promoting goes. There
are big crowds at the matches. I wanted
some place where I could get an idea of
what it would be like when I was a pro.
Felt wanted
"When I visited here last year I walked
on the court and Perry Wright yelled, 'Hi,
Peter.' And I knew who he was but I had
never talked to him so I thought, 'Wow,
how does he know me?' I was so blind. It
was obvious Dick had told him I was com
ing."
The change from high school to college
tennis meant a new outlook on the game
for Rennert. Tennis was no longer an in
dividual sport, but was a team effort.
"In high school it was who got his pic
ture in the paper for that day,"he said.
"My high school team didn't lose a
match. And we won the county and state
championships.
"This year I played challenge matches
for the first time. Those matches broke the
team apart for a while. They are harder
than playing any individual match.
Split personalities
"You're always looking out for your
self," he said. "Every tennis player is
egotistical. Theartofbeing good is handl
ing any egotism. You've got to think
you're great to be the best. But you've also
got to be two people — the 'best' on the
court and 'regular' off the court."
Rennert played at the No. 5 spot all year

for the Cards but the last four matches he
has only competed on the No. 3 doubles
duo. He and frosh Jim Hodges won both of
their matches against UCLA and I ISC last
weekend. They downed the Bruins'
Paley-Graham, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0, and the Tro
jans' Strode-Franker, 6-4, 6-0.
"I was down at first (after frosh Lloyd
Bourne took his spot at No. 5)," he said.
"But now I realize that doubles are just as
important as singles. In the beginning l
was too busy feeling sorry for myself.
Grown up
"I've learned a lot about life through
playing tennis. I see how well I perform in
a pressure situation. I'm more self
assured and have a better view of myself. I
like to be uniqueand a complete person. If
I just played tennis or just went to school
that wouldn't make me complete."
The tennis brat stereotype, Rennert
pointed out, he himself has had to over
come when first meeting people. And he
does not want to only be known as a net
star.
"People think girls are the only ones
who get used," he said, "but guys get
used too. I've been in positions where
girls want to go to parties with me be
cause I'm a tennis player. That happened
at home all the time — but not here."
Comedian
The most witty member of the team,
Rennert spends a lot of time dishing out
sarcastic remarks. He loves to talk and
admits that he's hard to shut up. His mind
is always running too.
He whips up funny wisecracks.
In his serious moments he ponders his
school work.
And often he dreams.
The .other day while watching a dou
bles match he fabricated the ultimate ten
nis player.
"I'd put together Connors' backhand,
Newcombe or Borg's forehand, Tanner's
serve and Mitchell's volleys. Ah, Mitch
ell's volleys."
He smiled and continued, "Can you
imagine putting all those things together
— having all those shots? The most im
portant asset though is the perfect mind.
The pros all have fantastic confidence in
themselves. That's how they make up for
the shot they don't have."
