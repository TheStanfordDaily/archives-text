Carter to ask fuel price hike
Washington —President Jimmy Carter will ask
Congress to approve substantial price increases
for gasoline and other fuels, lawmakers briefed
by the White House on the president's energy
plan confirmed yesterday.
If the president's program is approved, it could
add about seven cents to each gallon of gasoline
by 1979 and another four or five cents a gallon by
1981, said Rep. Thomas Ashley, stressing that
this would be in addition to a possible standby
gasoline tax of up to 50 cents a gallon if U.S.
gasoline consumption continues to increase.
Carter will spell out his proposals in an address
to a joint House-Senate session this evening. On
Monday night, he said in a nationally televised
address that the United States faces a possible
national catastrophe unless stiff conservation
measures are adopted.
U.S. consumer agency proposed
Washington — Unaccustomed White House
support may bring success this year to long
standing efforts to establish a federal agency to
represent consumers.
Some businesses also are supporting those ef
forts, which began again yesterday on Capitol
Hill.
Esther Peterson, President Jimmy Carter's con
sumer adviser, and representatives of an insur
ance industry group and a major clothing man
ufacturer endorsed the proposal to establish an
Agency for Consumer Advocacy to represent
consumers before other federal agencies.
Other industry groups, including the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, were expected to con
tinue their opposition to the proposal at Senate

and House hearings this week.
In past years the House has passed bills three
times to establish the agency while the Senate
has passed them twice. But the measures were
opposed by the Nixon and Ford administrations.
In contrast, Carter strongly supports the prop
osal.
Draft deserters return, clear names
Indianapolis — Nils Swenson and Phillip
Lower returned to the United States just long
enough yesterday to officially get out of the U.S.
Army they deserted during the Vietnam war.
Swenson and Gower were the first to take ad
vantage of Carter's program offering less-than
honorable discharges from the army. They said
many other deserters also were returning merely
to clear their records, with no intentions of living
in the United States again.
The army said about 1700 deserters are eligible
for the program, which covers persons who de
serted between Aug. 4,1964, and March 13,1973.
Those who deserted from combat zones or have
other charges against them are ineligible.
Gower, who said he has been working as a
reporter in Wallaceburg, Ontario, said it wasn't
an emotional decision; it was a legal decision to
return to the United States.
He said Carter's program, which gives non
combat deserters less-than-honorable dis
charges, was more equitable than any gesture
that was made in the past. It may be the last
gesture that is made.
Higher farm support approved
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has ag
reed to support higher federal price supports for

major farm crops for the next four years, Agricul
ture Secretary Bob Bergland said yesterday.
The new levels will more than double the po
tential cost of the farm programs the president
submitted to Congress less than four weeks ago.
That proposal would have cost just under $1 bill
ion a year whereas the new administration prog
ram is expected to cost about $2 billion.
The news was greeted with quick action by the
Senate Agriculture Committee, which reportedly
has been under pressure from grain grower
groups to amend the original Carter proposal.
The committee quickly gave tentative approval
to a $2.28-per-bushel target price for corn — 53
cents higher than Carter originally proposed and
still 28 cents higher than he has indicated he will
support.
Target prices are the minimum price the gov
ernment believes farmers should get for their
crop. If the actual price falls below the target
price, the government makes up the difference
with direct payments to farmers.
Larger Redwood Nat'l Park urged
Washington — The Carter administration
urged Congress yesterday to add 48,000 acres to
Redwood National Park in northern California to
protect the giant redwoods from woodcutters'
saws.
Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus conceded that
1000 to 1100 jobs would be eliminated during the
first year of expansion. He pledged to do all he
can to ease the impact.
He said a task force of economists, foresters and
other specialists will make studies in the next 60
to 90 days to determine what actions can be taken
to lessen the impact.

Environmentalists have expressed fear that
continued cutting in the park area will lead to
flooding that could deposit enough silt at the
base of the giant trees to kill them.
On the other hand, officials in Humboldt
County, population 100,000, say expansion of
the park would devastate an already-shaky
economy, wiping out 2230 jobs.
Income rise sharpest in two years
Washington — Americans' personal income in
March registered the sharpest monthly rise in
nearly two years, the Commerce Department said
yesterday.
Government economists were quick to point
out that the March figure probably was the
sharpest-ever income increase from private
sources. The previous one-month record set in
1975 was primarily a result of a special one-time
bonus $50 payment to Social Security recipients.
The news of a $24.2-billion jump in personal
income for March bolstered views the economy
was showing signs of recovery. Personal income
in February had shown an increase of $20.2 bill
ion over that received in January.
