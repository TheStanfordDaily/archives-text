# Honor Code to change?
## 
### Mike Charison 
After two years of studying the
Honor Code, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) has sub
mitted its proposal for a new Honor
Code.
The new code would include minor
rewording of the present code, an em
phasis on preventing violations and a
set of interpretations and applications
of the code, according to SCLC Chair
man Philip Rhinelander.
The council submitted its proposals
to President Richard Lyman on Mon
day after unanimously adopting them
at a council meeting last Friday,
Rhinelander said.
The SCLC has the power to legislate
changes in the Honor Code under the
provisions in the University Legislative
and Judicial Charter. The group has
been meeting for two years to attempt
to iron out problems of vagueness in
the wording of the code and lack of
community knowledge about the
code.
Vagueness problems were attacked
mainly through proposed "Interpreta
tions and Applications of the Honor
Code." Interpretation through exam
ple is the method selected which
Rhinelander said the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), the student judicial
body, could use as guidelines.
If problems can't be resolved within
those guidelines, Rhinelander said,
then the SJC can come back to the
SCLC for a review or it may set its own
precedent.

Paragraph A of the present code,
which gives an overall definition of
the Honor Code, would remain essen
tially unchanged.
Paragraph B, dealing with faculty
trust of the students, includes a new
sentence in the proposal requiring fa
culty to avoid "academic procedures
that create temptations to violate the
Honor Code."
Closed book take-home exams are an
example of just such a temptation,
Rhinelander said. This helps place the
code emphasis on violation preven
tion, he said.
The provision of the present code
which allows students to take exams
out of the examination room provided
alternate seats are available, would
still be allowed under the new code,
but would be listed as an application of
the code, rather than a part of the code
itself.
Paragraph D of the present code
would be reworded and would become
paragraph C under the proposal. It calls
for student-faculty cooperation in es
tablishing "optimal conditions for
honorable academic work."
Rhinelander stressed the need for
such cooperation, calling the concept
of an Honor Code a "community thing.
The Honor Code puts obligations on
the student (to perform honorably), but
that doesn't mean the faculty doesn't
have a large obligation to help imple
ment this," Rhinelander said. "We felt
the faculty had been amiss on this
point."

The council asked that its new
Honor Code, when adopted, replace
the Honor Code text currently printed
on the cover of examination
blue books.
To improve public awareness of the
Honor Code's provisions, the SCLC
suggested that an "Honor Code Com
mission" be established to make "ar
rangements for educating all students
and faculty members" about the Honor
Code.
Rhinelander said his group made no
specific recommendations to the
proposed commission because "im
plementation (of the Honor Code
proposals) should be left to other or
ganizations." He said the SCLC is
charged only with issuing legislation.
The Honor Code Commission would
consist of representatives of students,
faculty and administraton under the
SCLC proposal.
The complete text of the SCLC prop
osal will be published as an ad in the
Daily tomorrow.
