### Bill Burger 
A charge of discrimination against
the University and Stanford Hospital
was filed with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) yes
terday by Nancy Fuller, a Medical
Center employe.
The charge makes 15 subcharges,
including that Fuller was: "denied
medical leave of absence, denied over
time pay for time worked, denied
proper classification and pay, denied
educational and training oppor
tunities, verbally abused and physi
cally threatened, and unjustly discip
lined and threatened with loss of my
(Fuller's) job."
Fuller, a licensed vocational nurse
and a phlebotomist (blood lab techni

cian) at the hospital has been
employed for eight years by the Uni
versity.
She claimed "throughout my entire
employment at Stanford 1 have been
discriminated against because of my
race, national origin and sex."
Fuller is of Hispanic descent.
Fuller filed a previous charge with
the EEOC on April 12. The allegations
in yesterday's charge are said by Fuller
to have occurred since April 12.
USE President Anne Schlagenhaft
said "USE has been involved in fight
ing grievances for minority and
women workers at the hospital for at
least six years. During that time we
have won far more of those grievances
than we've lost."

Because of USE's success in backing
the workers, Schlagenhaft said the
hospital has "attempted to lessen our
influence.
"The hospital has consistently ig
nored the problems of minority work
ers," said Schlagenhaft, "even exploit
ing them to protect themselves from
having to deal with unionization."
Alexander Castellanos, president of
the Chicano Medical Students, said
the group fully supports Fuller in her
case.
Olga Gueiia, chairperson of La
Alianza Latina, a group concerned
with the needs of persons of Hispanic
descent, said the group is "supporting
Nancy (Fuller) and what she's trying to
do. I think it's a very important case."
