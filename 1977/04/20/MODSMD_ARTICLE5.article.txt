# Provost advocates chem grade change
## 
### Randy David 
A statement by Provost William Mil
ler that he would favor changing an
undergraduate's grade is the first time
in University history that an adminis
trator has overruled a professor on
grading, according to Ombudsman
John Goheen.
In a confidential letter acquired by
the Daily, Miller wrote he favored
changing a j>rade Chemistry Prof. Wil
liam Bonner gave to sophomore Peter
Cohen from a B to an A-.
Cohen began his grievance over his
Chemistry 33 grade 13 months ago.
Bonner can appeal Miller's recom
mendaton to President Richard Ly
man. Bonner hung up, though, when
the Daily called him for comments on
the case.

According to Goheen, until 1974,
professors' grade decisions were final.
In 1974, he said, an academic grie
vance procedure was established, with
a chain of appeals from department
chairmen up to the president.
First case
This is the first case under the grie
vance procedure, Goheen said, where
a student has won an appeal.
Cohen said Herant Katchadourian,
dean of undergraduate studies, had
earlier recommended the change.
In his April 8 confidential letter to
Bonner and Cohen, Miller wrote, "it is
fair and proper for Mr. Cohen to re
ceive a grade of A-....1 would rule in
favor of awarding the A-."
According to Cohen, one answer on
his final exam was overlooked by the
teaching assistant (TA) grading his
exam. The answer overlooked was
worth six points and Cohen needed
five more points to earn an A in the
course. He then went to Bonner to have
the test regraded.
The six points
Bonner referred Cohen to the TA to
have the test regraded. According to
Cohen, the TA gave him the six points
for the question overlooked. After
looking through the test, the TA
awarded Cohen an additional three
points for partial credit on other
answers.
In a letter to Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Gerald
Lieberman documenting his side of
the story, Bonner alleged that Cohen
had talked the TA "unwittingly" into
giving him additional credit.
Bonner said he had the right to re
grade an entire test if a particular ans
wer were regraded by a TA. This did
not apply to answers overlooked in
grading. However, since the TA had
added the three additional points of
partial credit for other answers, Bon
ner had the right to regrade the test,
according to Cohen.
When Cohen went to Bonner with
his regraded final, Bonner accepted

the new grade, Cohen said. However,
when his total points for the quarter
were added, it was found that the score
for Cohen's first midterm had been re
corded incorrectly. Bonner then told
Cohen to leave that first midterm and
the final with him.
Nineteen points
The next day, Cohen found that
Bonner had regraded the final and
taken off 19 points.
Cohen said he was "shocked by
Bonner's regrading. He said he asked
Bonner to go over the test with him,
but Bonner "asked me to leave his of
fice," said Coh<m.
Cohen said he did not feel it was fair
for Bonner, who had not initially
graded the test, to regrade his exam.
Cohen then went to the TAs for as
sistance and they found other exams
with the same answers as Cohen's, but
with more points. According to Cohen,
the TAs agreed that Cohen deserved an
A.
'Another look'
Following the formal grievance pro
cedure, Cohen said he went to see
Douglas Skoog, vice chairman of the
department. "I asked Prof. Bonner to
look over the exam again," Skoog said,
"and basically have another look at
things." Bonner did not change his
opinion, Skoog said.
According to Cohen, Bonner re
garded the exam a second time after
Skoog talked with the professor. Bon
ner came out with a slightly higher
grade than the first time he regraded it,
Cohen said.
After waiting a couple of weeks,
Cohen said he talked to Chemistry De
partment Chairman Eugene Van
Tamelen. Van Tamelen talked with
Bonner, but nothing was resolved,
Cohen said.
Cohen then talked with Lieberman.
Lieberman said, "I wrote a memo on it
to the dean of undergraduate studies."
Lieberman then referred Cohen to
