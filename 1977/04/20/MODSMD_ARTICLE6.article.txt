# King says Cubans are in Zaire

Rabat, Morocco (AP) —The Moroccan expeditionary
force in Zaire has "absolutely certain" proof that Cuban
soldiers are among the invaders of southeastern Zaire, King
Hassan II said in an interview published yesterday.
The Moroccan king spoke at his Marrakech Palace to a
group of French reporters on Monday, and the text was
distributed by the official Moroccan News Agency.
Hassan said interrogation of a prisoner taken in fighting
west of Kolwezi, the copper-mining center of invaded
Shaba Province, showed that Cubans and white Angolans
were extensively employed in the command, logistics and
training structure of the invading force.
He added that the Cuban presence was also evident "from
the point of view of the logistics, arms supplies, command,
training and infiltration methods" of the invaders.
Cuba, Angola and the Soviet Union have denied any
involvement in the Zaire war, which they have termed a
"purely internal affair."
Hassan avoided any suggestion that theSovietUnion was
directly implicated in the invasion. But he said the attack
was part of a massive strategy to undermine pro-Western
regimes in Africa and the Middle East, particularly the
Sudan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
In other developments:
—The Zaire government said its troops have encircled
the important road and rail town of Mutshatsha, 60 miles
east of Kolwezi. A spokesman in Kinshasa said the town
was surrounded by "elite Pygmy bowmen," but he did not
say how many were involved.
Exiles invade
Mutshatsha fell to invading Katangan exiles on March 27.
The town of 5000 is located on the Benguela railroad from

Angola that the rebels reportedly use to bring in some of
their supplies.
—The Soviet news agency Tass cited a communique of
the rebel Front for the National Liberation of Congo, saying
that Moroccan and French troops were taking part in the
fighting. France has denied that any of its military mission
in Zaire is involved in the fighting and there was no confir
mation of Moroccans doing any fighting yet.
Hassan flew a 1000-man expeditionary corps to Shaba
this month, becoming the only country to send troops thus
far in response to an appeal for help by Zaire's President
Mobutu Sese Seko against rebels who invaded Shaba from
Angola on March 8 and occupied a third of the province.
The bulk of the invaders are Zairean exiles who were
driven into Angola after an unsuccessful struggle in the
1960s to win independence for Shaba, then called Katanga.
Some Moroccans were part of the United Nations force that
helped crush the secessionists then.
No U.S. aid
Hassan expressed regret that the United States, unlike
France, has refused to give Mobutu the logistic help he
requested. France provided plans to fly the Moroccans and
their supplies to Shaba.
The king said any direct intervention of American forces
"would give the present conflict a very dangerous dimen
sion," but added:
"The only thing we ask is that they (the United States)
should give material and moral aid to those who are fight
ing for an ideal close to that of the United States.
"This moral aid can go as far as putting a certain pressure
on the protagonists. On the material level, the United States
could go as far as helping the Zaireans obtain the means to
defend the integrity of their territory."
