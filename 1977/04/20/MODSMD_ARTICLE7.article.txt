When the Board of Trustees voted last
Tuesday to abstain on proxies calling for
reduced investment in South Africa, we
believe the board took the most effective
action it could to protest apartheid in
South Africa.
Demonstrators that day had asked the
trustees to vote "yes" on six shareholder
resolutions. These measures call for six
companies which the University has
holdings in either to end or stop expand
ing their investments in South Africa.
We see two problems with "yes" votes.
First, the University's holdings in these
companies are minute, compared to total
stock outstanding. Such shareholder re
solutions rarely draw more than 10 per
cent support, and "yes" votes from the
University would add little practical or
spiritual support to efforts to end apar
theid.
An abstention, however, is an unusual
step which draws far more attention to
the voter's position than a "yes" vote
which will count little in an election that
will be far from close.
Peter Bing, trustee president, is correct
in saying that the University can best call
attention to its position by abstaining on
the proxies, and writing to the firms in

volved, calling for them to accelerate
their efforts to break apartheid.
A second problem with "yes" votes is
that the resolutions do not squarely at
tack apartheid. If American companies
did divest, the groups that would buy
them out —either the South African gov
ernment or a foreign country—would be
even less concerned with fighting apar
theid than the U.S. corporations are.
A better way to seek change in South
Africa would be to require strict adher
ence to standards set down in the so
called "six principles" adopted by 12
major U.S. corporations with extensive
investment in that country.
Basically, the principles state those
corporations are committed to equal op
portunity in South Africa.
Therefore, we urge the University to
put forth its own shareholder proposals
to require each corporation with South
African investment to abide by the "six
principles" whether they initially sup
ported them or not.
Changing a system from within has
proven effective in the past. Divesting in
terest in a world trouble spot serves only
to further the problem—not correct it.
