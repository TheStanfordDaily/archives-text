# Senate hoax
## 
### 
D'ja hear the one about the time ASSU
Sen. Jeff Stoler and his friend Sen. Mike
King started a recall petition drive
against ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Mathe? Well, it turns out it was all a joke
and no one really wanted to kick Mathe
out anyway.
Isn't that hilarious?
Mathe wasn't laughing.
Neither were fulltime employes of the
A.SSU who work for and with Mathe and
whose security he was protecting by re
fusing to hand out thousands of dollars in
refunds in White Plaza.
Nor were ASSU senators and other
students whose concern for voluntary fee
assessments is genuine and who sup
ported the White Plaza proposal out of
principle.
Even Stoler himself looked downright
uncomfortable as he struggled to explain
to the senate Monday night why he had
perpetrated the hoax and helped lower

the senate's reputation among students to
a still more dismal abyss.
Perhaps justice will be done soon and
the senate will censure Stoler and King or
a real recall drive will force them from
office. Perhaps not. But either way, they
have done the ASSU and the body in
which they serve a great disservice by
staging this farce. More important, they
have sullied the reputation of an ASSU
officer whose record is above reproach.
In his defense, Stoler argued that he
didn't thinkup the hoax at all, but instead
was the innocent victim of a Daily error
in which "16 or 15" signatures became
"1650" in our story. He never could quite
get past his statement last Thursday that
he had 2000 signatures on his petitions,
though.
Maybe he would have been more hon
est to have admitted that he simply
couldn't recall.
