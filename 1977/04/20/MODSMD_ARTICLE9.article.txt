## Women's Band Caucus 
### 
Misrepresentation
The Women's Caucus of the Stanford Band
takes exception to several of Hal Mickelson's
statements in his recent letter (Daily, April
18).
In particular, we object to his misrepresen
tation of our concern about the esthetic attri
butes of new yell leaders. He suggested that
we would like to see "rugged suntanned
beefcake types" brought in as candidates.
The Women's Caucus of the Stanford Band
wants to make certain that newly-chosen
yell leaders meet certain minimum stan
dards. We won't insist on Greek god
physiques or Cannon of Iron endowments,
because we know we won't find any Robert
Redfords hanging around the Physics Tank.
You may recall the old saying, "Nine out

of 10 California men are studly and the 10th
one writes for the Chaparral."
Male Bandsmen have a role in the selec
tion of new pompon Dollies. This would be a
useful model for a woman's role in the selec
tion of new yell leaders. As our manager
says, the men try to find good dancers and
reject "trolls under the drawbridge" without
imposing unreasonably high standards of
physical beauty. "We don't look for Farrah
Fawcett-Majors, but we don't want any
toothless harpies, either."
Women in the Band have similar objec
tives. We've seen Jim Jett and Hal Mickelson
try to lead yells and we know what to avoid.
We want to make sure that Stanford yell
leaders have soothing voices, what passes
for wit and above-average legs.

We ask that the incumbent Dollies, the
Women's Band Caucus and female ASSU
representatives, as well as intercollegiate
sports representatives have a suitable part in
the selection process. We demand a chance
to weed out the obvious wimps, preferably
by a swimsuit competition.
And if Gary Cavalli shows up in some
rugby shorts instead of his usual tacky doub
leknits, we'll probably give him a chance.
