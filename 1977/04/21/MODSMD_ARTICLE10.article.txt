# New sexual menace: 'kidporn'
## 
### 
"Kidporn" is the newest por
nographic fashion.
Little Girls Together and Mop
pets magazines are porno
bestsellers.
Sex films of children can be
purchased from porn shops or
viewed at porn theaters (if you
can get there before the police
do).
"The younger, the better"
seems to be the message. Why
wade through Vladimir
Nabokov's complex novel in
search of 12-year-old "Lolita"
when six-year-old "Lollitots"
are available?
District attorneys are crusad
ing against "kidporn." So are
child welfare advocates, like Dr.
Judianne Densen-Gerber of New
York's Odyssey Institute. But it's
an uphill battle.
Porn shop and theater owners
"don't know" who distributes
the materials they purvey. The
distributors who can be tracked
down "don't know" who pro
duces the materials they distri
bute.
Shady business
Well, pornography has always
been a shadybusiness, at best, so
perhaps it was just too dark for
these operators to see with
whom they exchanged money
for merchandise.
But this latest kink in pornog
raphy is no laughing matter.
Children are being sexually
abused for the profit and "plea
sure" of adults.
They are entitled to their sex
uality, but on their own terms,
not on those of adults. Adult
sexual exploitation and manipu
lation of children is unmitigated
abuse.
For the civil libertarians,
"kidporn" creates a constitu
tional dilemma. Where do First
Amendment rights end and
child protection rights begin?
Those who defend the pornog
raphic degradation of adult
women aren't finding it easy to
defend such degradation of
children.
In one of several responses to
last quarter's discussion of por :
nography in this space, a writer
invoked what might be called
the "right of arousal." Some
poor folks, the letter pointed out,
just have to have a heavy dose of
pictorial sado-masochism before
they can enjoy sex.
Defenders
Apparently, there are some
who defend such a right.
Moreover, according to the San

Francisco Examiner (April 14),
these people also defend the
"rights of all consenting persons
to have sex, regardless of age,"
and have been petitioning the
state legislature for such a bill.
This group, whose slogan has
been, "sex before eight or it's too
late," is not the only one of its
kind.
Those of us who are appalled
by the pornographic exploita
tion of young children for fun
and profit should not be sur
prised by. its existence. In es
sence, it is a logical outgrowth of
the porno trade.

If society willingly accepts the
pornographic degradation of
one group (women), the door is
left wide open to degrading
another group (children). This
same kind of attitude is found in
racism. If one minority can be
oppressed, so can another.
And women and children
have more in common than por
nographic exploitation. They
have always been lumped to
gether, as in "Sell the women
and children into slavery"( B
ible), "Save the women and chil
dren" (Titanic) or "Who wants
to be left behind with the women
and children?" (Western
movies).
Neither group has ever had
legal rights equal with men.
Until well into this century, both
were ruthlessly exploited by
capitalist industry.
Women and children as
targets of the pornographer
should astonish no one, because
they are inextricably connected
in our thoughts and attitudes.
Answer?
What's the answer? Shall we
violate the constitutional rights
of the porn producers and adult
actors? Does a First Amendment
which protects Deep Throat also
protect Youthful Lust? And if it
does, do the adult actors in "kid
porn" go free from child
molesting charges, while non
filmed child molesters are pro
secuted?

The issue of "kidporn" only
serves to underscore the argu
ment of the last column in this
space on pornography, which
said that male sexuality often
centers on force and power,
rather than on sensuality or sex
ual sharing.
There will probably be those
who will blame the women's
movement for "kidporn."
Feminism has been accused of
causing the supposed recent in
crease in male impotence, using
the assumption that male sexul
ity retreats in the face of female
independence and assertive
ness. Could the same apply to
"kidporn"?
Some psychiatrists theorize
that the typical connoisseur of
child pornography is a timid,
inhibited sort of man who has
difficulty relating sexually to an
adult woman.
Does this mean that the wo
men's movement is to blame?
The answer is a resounding
"no"! The real culprit is the sort
of sexuality men have chosen to
fashion for themselves. Women
are growing less and less willing
to be oppressed, and we cer
tainly cannot permit children to
replace them for the sake of male
sexuality.

The time is here when male
sexuality has to be re-examined
and re-evaluated. Men need to
ask themselves what arouses
them and why.
No law in the world could
effectively regulated sexual de
sire and fantasy because no law
can control mental activity. But
it is necessary to control certain
destructive forms of sexual be
havior, and the use of children's
bodies to produce adult "thrills"
is one of these.
The concern here is not "What
is good for people?" but "What
is good for children?" Persons
who have been victims of incest
and other sexual abuse in child
hood testify that these experi
ences haunt them all of their
adult lives and that the trauma
prohibits their enjoyment of
normal adult sex relations.
Are we going to inflict this
kind of sexual hell on young
children in the name of profits
and perverse pleasures? Are we
going to construe the First
Amendment as permitting chil
dren to be degraded and
exploited for an adult's secret
fantasies?
