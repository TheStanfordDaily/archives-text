LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
( Following is a memo to President Richard Lyman, the
1 Steering Committee of the Senate of the Academic Council,
j the ASSU Council of Presidents, and chairperson, ASSU
( Senate from Prof. PH. Rhioelander, chairman of SCLC, on
\ the draft of the proposed Honor Code with interpretations
\ and applications.
) 1. Pursuant to Section D, 1, b of Appendix A to the
j Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, as amended, I
} transmit herewith a draft of proposed legislation which was
( unanimously adopted at a meeting of the SCLC on Friday,
( April 15, 1977. The proposed legislation includes a proposed
revision of the Honor Code together with a set of provisions
j governing its interpretation and application. Arrangements
) are being made for publication in the Stanford Daily and the
Campus Report as soon as possible.
j 2. Pursuant to Section D,l, c, the SCLC sets Thursday,
May 12, as the deadline for receiving written comments and
j suggested revisions. Such comments and suggestions may be
| forwarded to me at the Philosophy Department, Room 91E,
I or in care of James Siena at the President's Office,
j 3. The SCLC plans also to hold a public hearing on
\ campus on the evening of Tuesday, April 26, to receive oral
) comments and suggestions from interested members of the
University community. The hearing will be bejin at 7:30
( p.m. in the Meyer Forum Room.
( 4. The SCLC also submits the following supplementary
j recommendations which are not intended to constitute part
j of the proposed legislation but are regarded as necessary and
| desirable for its effective implementation:
I a. The customary statement which currently appears on
examination blue books should be eliminated and
j replaced by the full language of Paragraphs A,B, and C
| of the Honor Code as revised.
b. An Honor Code Commission, consisting of representa
( tives of students, faculty, and administration, should
j be established to make arrangements for educating all
) students and faculty members, (with particular atten
| tion to new students and new faculty) about the
Honor Code. This Commission should also be directed
and empowered to prescribe the form of affirmation
J of the Honor Code to be expected from students at
| registration and upon examination blue books.
j PROPOSED HONOR CODE
| Following is the text of the proposed Honor Code
( unanimously approved by the Student Conduct Legislative
\ Council April 15, 1977 Revisions and additions to present
j Code are italicized See explanatory notes.
) A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students,
( individually and collectively:
( 1) That they will not give or receive aid in examination; *
( that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in
; class work, in the preparation of reports, or any other
| work that is to be used by the instructor as the basis
( of grading;
( 2) That they will do their share and take an active part in
j seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold
) the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.
B The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the
( honor of its students by refraining from proctoring examina
Hons and from taking unusual and unreasonable precautions
j to prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above. The
j faculty will also avoid, as far as practicable, academic proceâ– 

dures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code.
C. While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to
set academic requirements, the students and faculty will
work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable
academic work.
Explanatory notes:
As to A The initial words "The Honor Code is" have
been incorporated into paragraph A. The order of the
subparagraphs has been shifted but without change of the
present wording.
As to B: The phrase "taking unusual and unreasonable
precautions" has been substituted for the phrase "otherwise
taking special steps" in the present code. The second sen
tence is an addition.
As to C: Paragraph C of the present Honor Code,
regarding taking examinations outside the examination room
when alternate seating is available now appears as Paragraph
2(f) of the Specific Interpretations and Applications. Para
graph D of the present Honor Code has become Paragraph C,
with the addition of a new introductory clause and a slight
rewording of the concluding phrase.
INTERPRETATIONS AND
APPLICATIONS OF THE
HONOR CODE
1. General
a) The Honor Code is agreed to by every student who
registers at Stanford University and by every instructor who
accepts an appointment.
b) The Honor Code provides a standard of honesty and
declares that compliance with that standard is to be ex
pected. It does not contemplate that the standard will be
self-enforcing but calls on students, faculty, and administra
tion to encourage compliance and to take reasonable steps to
discourage violations. If violations occur, procedures are
prescribed by the Legislative and Judicial Charter. However,
the Honor Code depends for its effectiveness primarily on the
individual and collective desire of all members of the commu
nity to prevent and deter violations rather than on pro
ceedings to impose penalties after violations have occurred.
c) It must be understood that the individual and collec
tive responsibility of the students for upholding the Honor
Code (including so-called third party responsibility) was not
imposed upon the students by the administration or the
faculty but was assumed by the students at their own
request. Without such student responsibility, the Honor Code
cannot be effectively maintained.
d) In interpreting and applying the general provisions of
the Honor Code, it should be kept in mind that although
primary responsibility for making the Code effective rests
with the students, faculty cooperation is essential, since the
faculty sets the academic requirements which students are to
meet. The faculty should endeavor to avoid academic require
ments and procedures which place honorable and conscien
tious students at a disadvantage. The faculty should also be
ready and willing to consult with students and should be
responsive to their suggestions in these matters.
2. Specific Interpretations and Applications
a. Third-p<*rty responsibility: A primary responsibility
assumed by students is to discourage violat is of the Honor
Code by others. Various methods are ( ssible. Drawing
attention to a suspected violation may stop it. Moral suasion
may be effective. Initiating formal procedures is a necessary
and obligatory remedy when other methods are inappropriate
or have failed Faculty members have like responsibilities
when suspected violations come to their attention.

b. "Proctoring": Proctoring means being present in the |
examination room for the purpose of preventing dishonesty. (
The prohibition against proctoring should not be construed
to prohibit the instructor from visiting the examination room (
briefly to answer questions or to make announcements (e.g., \
about the time remaining for completion). Nor does it )
prohibit the instructor from visiting the examination room in r
response to specific prior reports from students that cheating (
has been observed to investigate the basis for such reports. (
c. "Unusual and unreasonable precautions": In inter- )
preting and applying this provision, consideration should be )
given to standard procedures which are customary at Stan- 112
ford and the need for cooperation between students and (
faculty in making the Honor Code effective. The following \
situations are cited as examples: j
An instructor should not require students to identify |
themselves before being admitted to an examination room, or j
require students to submit in advance to being searched for (
notes or other materials, or maintain surveillance upon
students who leave the examination room. Nor should the
instructor take deliberate steps to invite dishonesty in order
to entrap students. Procedures of this kind would be unusual 1
and unreasonable. \
On the other hand, an instructor may require copies of an j
examination or test to be returned after the examination.
When possible, alternate seating should be provided and used )
for all examinations. To avoid controversy in any rereading j
or regrading of students' work, the instructor may take
measures by which the original work may be clearly identi- j
fied. An instructor who requires students to make up a )
missed test or examination may administer a different test or
examination of equivalent range and difficulty. Such proce- \
dures are not to be construed as unusual or unreasonable. j
d. "Procedures that create temptations to violate the )
Honor Code": Although students are expected to resit (
temptations to cheat, the faculty should endeavor to mini- \
mize inducements to dishonesty. j
Examples of undesirable procedures include the follow- J
ing: failure to give clear directions and instructions con- )
cerning course requirements; treating required work casually
as if it were unimportant; carelessness or inconsistency in (
maintaining security of examinations or tests; reusing an \
examination which is neither kept secure from public expo- ,i
sure nor made available to all students. If take-home exami- i
nations are given, they should not be closed-book examina- i
tions, nor should there be a specified time limit less than the
full period between the distribution of the examination and ,
its due date. Such procedures place honorable and consci
entious students in a difficult position and often at a |
disadvantage. j
e. Penalty grading: Under the Legislative and Judicial (
Charter, students are not to be penalized for violations of the
Honor Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as
therein provided. An instructor may lot, therefore, lower a j
student's grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence
of such formal proceedings unless the student is informed \
and gives consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty j
may, with ihe student's consent, request that the work be )
redone and resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted r
work. (
112. Taking tests outside the examination room: Provided )
that alternate seats are available, tests will be taken from the
classroom only with the consent of the instructor. (Adopted
by student referendum as an addition to the Honor Code in ;
1955.)
