# Newspapers fight pretrial press ban
## 
### 
Oakland (AP) â€” Two news
papers and a press club filed
legal papers yesterday in an ef
fort to head off a defense attempt
to ban press and public from a
pretrial hearing in the Chow
chilla mass kidnaping case.
Attorneys for Fred Woods and
Jarnes Schoenfeld, both 24, and
Richard Schoenfeld, 22, have
said they will ask Judge Leo
Deegan to clear the courtroom of
press and spectators for a hear
ing Tuesday in Alameda County
Superior Court.
In the hearing, the attorneys
will challenge the validity of a
mountain of evidence seized
under search warrants in four
counties in the aftermath of the

July 15 kidnaping of 26 Chow
chilla children and their school
bus driver.
The attorneys are expected to
aigue that the evidence should
not be used against Woods and
the Schoenfelds because, they
claim, it was obtained in viola
tion of search and seizure
safeguards of the U.S. Constitu
tion.
The defense team has indi
cated it will ask Judge Deegan, a
retired Riverside County
Superior Court judge appointed
to preside at the trial, to close the
hearing because testimony will
be based upon a sealed transcript
of the grand jury that indicted
Woods and the Schoenfelds.
Attorneys for the San Fran
cisco Examiner, the Oakland
Tribune and the East Bay Press
Club asked Judge Deegan yes
terday to allow them to intervene
in the hearing to oppose the mo
tion.
