# Films to explore 'Western Culture'

Could you imagine History
1,2 and 3, Art 1, the
Humanities series and
Philosophy 5 all squeezed
into one five-hour dose?
Dr. Francis Schaeffer, a
noted Christian thinker, has
attempted to do this in his
10-part film series, "How
Should We Then Live? The
Rise and Decline of Western
Thought and Culture."
Stanford's Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship will
show Schaeffer's film series
in three installments on April
25, May 2 and May 9 in
Kresge Auditorium.
Although Schaeffer is an
American, he has lived in
Switzerland for the past 30
years. There he founded
L'Abri Fellowship, a Christ
ian community called by
some, "a mission to intellec
tuals." Schaeffer has also
written many books on Chris
tianity and Western culture.
In his film series, Schaeffer
rallies all his thoughts and
probes the broad expanse
commonly called "Western
Culture," similar to Kenneth
Clark's Civi I isut ion and
Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Like Clark and Bronowski,
Schaeffer traveled to many
countries and continents to
film the series he narrates.

But the similarity between
Schaeffer's effort and others
like it abruptly ends there.
Schaeffer cries out like an Old
Testament prophet, saying
that Western Civilization is
doomed if i t does not return to
its roots in Biblical Christian
ity.
Schaetfer stands squarely
in the Reformation tradition.
He believes that the Bible is
the Word of God, the one ab
solute standard of all reality
for all time. Modern Western
culture, Schaeffer says, was
rooted in the absolutes of the
Bible.
His analyses, although
strongly Christian, are not
pulpit-pounding, jelly
minded rantings. Schaeffer
deftly sifts our culture with
all the intellectual verve of
any noted scholar. But
Schaeffer reaches conclu
sions rarely heard from mod
ern scholars.
Schaeffer explains that Fn
lightenment thinkers helped
divorce the West from its
Christian moorings, setting
us adrift in a world of relative
truth, where no absolutes
exist. This relative truth,
Schaeffer says, is responsible
tor the ruthless dictators,
rampant crime and bloated af
fluence of today, among other
things.
