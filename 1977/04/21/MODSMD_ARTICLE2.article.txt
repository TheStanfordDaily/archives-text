# Fundraising drive $8 million from goal
## 
### Gary Furlong 
The Campaign for Stanford, a $300
million five-year fundraising drive
that began in early 1972, is only $8
million from the goal.
The General Secretary's Office
(GSO) is primarily responsible for the
drive, according to Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice president for de
velopment, but the majority of the
fundraising is done by approximately
4500 volunteers.
The drive is divided into three main
funds, "major gifts, special gifts and
the annual fund," according to Cam
paign Countdown, a publication put
out by the GSO.
The three funds are headed by vol
unteer chairmen and each has a diffe
rent emphasis. The major gifts fund
handles gifts over $100,000, the spe
cial gifts fund handles gifts from $1000
to $100,000 and the annual fund gifts
under $1000, according to Dave Ful
ton, director of communication for the
GSO.
A lot from a few
"Most of the money comes from a
small amount of people" said Kevin
Callaghan, a fundraising organizer for
the GSO. He said that there is a pool of
100,000 potential donors made up of
alumni and friends of the University.
The pool is categorized on the basis of
gift history.
He said that 90,000 people in the
pool receive a telephone call once
every three years through an organized
telethon in which student and alumni
volunteers make around 30,000 calls

per year to solicit small donations.
Out of the other 10,000 potential
donors, he said, 6000 give about $100
per year on the average, with the other
4000 contributing larger amounts.
Telephone calls, personal contact
and a barrage of letters all play a part in
the fundraising process, Callaghan
said.
Thomas Flood, an alumnus and
seven-year veteran of telethons here,
said he has found an interesting trend.
Special group
"In the last few years we set up a
special group of engineering alumni
who specifically solicit other en
gineering alumni. Since then the aver
age amount of money pledged from
engineering graduates has gone up.

They seem to be able to relate to each
other much better," Flood said.
Callaghan, who is the director of the
engineering fund, said that he is
pleased with the results and said that
other schools in the University are also
represented by funds.
The majority of the funds raised do
not come through the various phone
and mail campaigns, but through
major gifts from corporations, founda
tions and large' personal gifts, accord
ing to Jon Cosovich, director of the
major gift fund. These make up 85 per
cent of the funds raised, Cosovich said.
Some of the large donations are
made on a matching funds basis, ac
cording to Cosovich. He gave as an
example a $15 million anonymous do

nation of which $11 million was
pledged to be paid only if the Univer
sity could raise another $11 million to
match it. All of the $11 million was
matched by last year, he said.
5o far, the campaign has only cost
the University about $20 million or
seven cents out of every dollar raised,
according to Cuthbertson.
The campaign organizers have set
April 30 as the deadline for the end of
the campaign, but are unsure whether
all $300 million will be raised by then.
"It's going right down to the wire."
said Richard E. Guggenhime, one of
the co-chairmen of the campaign.
"But, even if we go over a few weeks,
the campaign definitely isn't a fai
lure."

Thomas Flood, an alumnus and
seven-year veteran of telethons here,
said he has found an interesting trend.
Special group
"In the last few years we set up a
special group of engineering alumni
who specifically solicit other en
gineering alumni. Since then the aver
age amount of money pledged from
engineering graduates has gone up.

They seem to be able to relate to each
other much better," Flood said.
Callaghan, who is the director of the
engineering fund, said that he is
pleased with the results and said that
other schools in the University are also
represented by funds.
The majority of the funds raised do
not come through the various phone
and mail campaigns, but through
major gifts from corporations, founda
tions and large' personal gifts, accord
ing to Jon Cosovich, director of the
major gift fund. These make up 85 per
cent of the funds raised, Cosovich said.
Some of the large donations are
made on a matching funds basis, ac
cording to Cosovich. He gave as an
example a $15 million anonymous do

nation of which $11 million was
pledged to be paid only if the Univer
sity could raise another $11 million to
match it. All of the $11 million was
matched by last year, he said.
5o far, the campaign has only cost
the University about $20 million or
seven cents out of every dollar raised,
according to Cuthbertson.
The campaign organizers have set
April 30 as the deadline for the end of
the campaign, but are unsure whether
all $300 million will be raised by then.
"It's going right down to the wire."
said Richard E. Guggenhime, one of
the co-chairmen of the campaign.
"But, even if we go over a few weeks,
the campaign definitely isn't a fai
lure."
The Campaign for Stanford, a $300
million five-year fundraising drive
that began in early 1972, is only $8
million from the goal.
The General Secretary's Office
(GSO) is primarily responsible for the
drive, according to Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice president for de
velopment, but the majority of the
fundraising is done by approximately
4500 volunteers.
The drive is divided into three main
funds, "major gifts, special gifts and
the annual fund," according to Cam
paign Countdown, a publication put
out by the GSO.
The three funds are headed by vol
unteer chairmen and each has a diffe
rent emphasis. The major gifts fund
handles gifts over $100,000, the spe
cial gifts fund handles gifts from $1000
to $100,000 and the annual fund gifts
under $1000, according to Dave Ful
ton, director of communication for the
GSO.
A lot from a few
"Most of the money comes from a
small amount of people" said Kevin
Callaghan, a fundraising organizer for
the GSO. He said that there is a pool of
100,000 potential donors made up of
alumni and friends of the University.
The pool is categorized on the basis of
gift history.
He said that 90,000 people in the
pool receive a telephone call once
every three years through an organized
telethon in which student and alumni
volunteers make around 30,000 calls

per year to solicit small donations.
Out of the other 10,000 potential
donors, he said, 6000 give about $100
per year on the average, with the other
4000 contributing larger amounts.
Telephone calls, personal contact
and a barrage of letters all play a part in
the fundraising process, Callaghan
said.
