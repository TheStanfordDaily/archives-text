## Unique blend screened at P.A. festival 
### 
A unique blend of indepen
dent films ranging from compu
ter animation to seedy melod
rama was screened at the Palo
Alto Cultural Center last
weekend as part of the Second
Annual Palo Alto Film Festival.
Fifteen short films were selected
to be shown from over 60 entries
that were submitted by profes
sional and amateur filmmakers
from the Northern California
area. Seven films were awarded
the $200 in cash prizes in the
festival's three categories:
BmmisuperBinm junior (18 years
and under), Bmm/super Bmm
senior (19 years and over) and
16mm.

The trick to successful inde
pendent film production is in
novation in either ideas or
technique. Al Wong's "Working
Class," for example, the first
place winner in the 16mm
category, presents a brilliantly
distorted and mechanized view
of the San Franciso financial dis
trict.
Perhaps the most well
received film of the festival was a
five-minute short by David
Casci, 21, of Palo Alto, called
"Poppin Flesh." Using model
animation, the film reveals a
bizarre antagonism between the
commercial housewife and her
precious doughboy. The film is a
sardonic take-off, technically
well-made and nicely executed.
Two films by Fresno's Jim
Piper—both co-first-place win
ners in the senior super Bmm
category—were the most ad
mired at the festival. "Photo
Finish," which also received the
best of show award, is about a
photographer who urges a
wasted young woman to commit
suicide so that he has a photo
spread he thinks people want to
see.
Piper's "Picaresque," about a
young man and the pregnant girl
he leaves while she agonizes in

labor, is equally as disturbing as
"Photo Finish."
Other films that impressed
both judges and audience were
two by Kai Lenz, a student here.
The films, "Short" and"The
Hunt," were both clever anima
tions about houseflies.

Although many of the films in
the festival were seriously
flawed, all displayed at least one
original element. For this
reason, the Palo Alto Film Festi
val is an important event to the
community and independent
filmmakers.
