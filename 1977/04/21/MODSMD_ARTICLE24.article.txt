## 'Carmen Jones' direction disappoints 
### 
The Committee on Black Per
forming Arts began its opening
night performance of Carmen
Jones for a half-capacity crowd
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium; it
finished with something less
than that.
Oscar Hammerstein Jr. be
lieved Carmen to be "a perfect
wedding of story and music."
Sadly, this company's produc
tion resulted in a tragic divorce
between the cast and the direc
tor.
For you pre-meds, Carmen
Jones is an adaptation of Bizet's
grand opera, Carmen. Car men
Jones retains the plot and music
of the orginial, but changes the
dialogue and lyrics. Hammers
tein's version was written delib
erately in the black idiom. It
concerns the beautiful and
scornful Carmen Jones and her
torrid love affair with meek and
homely Joe.
Shortcomings blanketed
Juanita Lott, in the role of
Carmen, carried the show with
her acting and singing talents.
As beautiful as her voice, Lott
is to he commended on her fine
performance. With hands at hips
and a shake of the head, she be
came Carmen. Her voice was
pure and strong, her words
well-enunciated.
Sharing the limelight with
Lott was Cedric Cannon in the
role of Husky Miller, a prize
fighter and Carmen's last lover.
His portrayal was reminiscent of
Muhammed Ali without being
overdone. Cannon was by far the
finest male vocalist in the cast;
his voice was loud and clear, and
his words well-pronounced, a
factor which is very important
for preventing boredom in op
era.
Soon into the opera, it became
apparent thatCerald Chappell as
Joe. Carmen's penultimate lover,
was not chosen for his acting
ability. Chappell was unable to
convey the deep passion Joe felt
for Carmen or the bitter jealousy
that drove him to murder her. It
is unfortunate that director John
Cochran wasn't more in tune
with the role of Joe, as Chappell
showed great potential for its

development.
Neglected details
A number of details neglected
by the director were crucial to
the overall outcome of the pro
duction. Throughout the cafe
and country club scenes, the
same waiter could be seen traips
ing back and forth across the
stage. This was at first somewhat
annoying. Just as Carmen would
break into song, the wandering
waiter would cross behind her
witn a tray of empty glasses and
bottles. As the second act wore
on, the waiter began to take pre
cedence over the other actors.
An equally irritating detail
overlooked was the use of
break-away glass in the first act.
When Joe is bullied by his
sergeant (Gary Watson) over his
love for Carmen. Joe becomes
irate, smashing a bottle over the
sergeant's head. The use
of break-away glass was effec
tive, illiciting a gasp from the
audience. However, bits and
pieces of the glass were strewn
across the stage and for the re
mainder of the first act, cracks
and pops of the glass bits being
smashed could be heard over the

voices of the actors.
Awkward exit
The second dance number,
"African Waltz," was nicely
choreographed save for an awk
ward exit which left the dancers
leaping up a set of stairs.
With its low budget, low pool
of actors from which to select
and poor direction, it is no won
der that the Commitee on Black
Performing Arts production of
Carmen is not Broadway mate
rial.
The primary factor to Car
men's inability to be anything
more than a two-hour study
break seemed to be its poor di
rection. Cochran seemed aloof
from the cast, with neither party
cooperating with the other. The
curtain call exemplified this.
Prior to their bow, chorus
members looked at each other as
if to see who dared go first, then,
with a soft shoe reminiscent of
high school talent shows, made
their bow. This action was terri
bly out of place in what was sup
posedly a grand opera and I am
amazed the cast did this and
even more amazed the director
allowed it.

With professional ticket prices
and professional-sounding pub
licity, it is unfortunate that this
company's production of Car
men is at best a good alternative
to studying or Mary Tyler Moore
reruns.
Curmen will conclude its run
tomorrow, Saturday and Sun
day.
