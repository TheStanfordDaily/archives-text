# Feiffer's play probing, biting, witty
## 
### 
Jules Feiffer's Hold Me! is an
eclectic experiment, an
exhilarating enterprise underta
ken without precedent in his
own career or in the life of the
theatre.
For the theatre, this as
semblage of 40 sketches (over
600 cartoons were sifted by Pat
ten and Feiffer) were carefully
interwoven, methodically or
ganized into four principal sec
tions (two acts) and focused into
five principal characters: Ber
nard Mergendeiler, Feiffer's
alter ego (William Snikowski);
the Grown-up, Bernard's alter

ego in middle-age (Richard
Schaal); the Dancer, a young
lady in leotards who interprets
her life and ours through dance
(Anna Levine); a young woman,
a multi-faceted reflection of Ber
nard's triumphs and tribulations
with the opposite sex (Elayne
Heilveil); an older woman, the
young woman 20 years older,
but not proportionally wiser
(Rose Arrick).
Only You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown, a musical drawn
from the cartoons of Charles
Schultz, might be used for com
parison, but that would be an

academic exercise; Feiffer is in
finitely richer, devestatingly
more hysterical, and, more im
portantly, writing about the ex
periences of adults, infantile and
mature, in love and out of love,
developing the tools with which
to deal with the troubled present
and, if we believe Feiffer, an
even more uncertain future.
For theatregoers, Hold Me!
provides three distinctive de
lights: the exploration of human
relations, done with sagacity,
sarcasm and style by Feiffer; the
clean, concise, almost fluid, di
rection of Patten who integrates
the sketches into a whole that
powerfully develops a group of
fundamental themes ("trying to
get a hold of yourself, marriage
and relationships, paranoid
people, and extremism of all
forms" according to Richard Sc
haal) and examines the changes,
physical, psychological, and
pathological, produced by the
characters' experiences; and,
thirdly, five actors who propel
two dimensional archetypes
from the printed page into four
dimensional, fully fleshed
people.
Levine brings professional
ballet experience to her por
trayal of the Dancer who
dramatizes the most mundane
experiences in life (in "Dance of
the Mundane" and "Dance to

Torpor") and the most moving
with equal acuity and en
thusiasm (in the "Dance to
Hope," she continues dancing
although she is informed, mid
way, that she has been fired due
"to changing economic condi
tions").
In her presentation of the in
telligent, if slightly insane,
middle-aged woman. Arrick de
livers her lines with engaging ef
fectiveness: "When 1 tell a man
that I'm bright, they think that
I'm saying that I'm brighter.
They're right."
Snikowski and Schaal, Ber
nard younger and elder, respec
tively, dramatize, with uncanny
precision, the fears and follies of
modern existence.
Schaal, formerly a member of
Second City (perhaps the
greatest improvisational troupe
in the United States), de
monstrated his mastery of mime,
song and tap dancing (briefly
used in several of the sketches)
in a dramatic tour de force.
Heilveil, as the smashing
young woman who teases, tan
talizes and terrifies Bernard,
forcefully and successfully pre
sented several of the more dif
ficult sketches where a more
serious tone prevailed and no
gag line punctuated the conclu
sion.
