The Blue Dahlia Alan Ladd
and Veronica Lake star in this
competent murder-mystery/
detective thriller. Raymond
Chandler wrote the screenplay
in the late summer of his writing
career, a fact apparent in the
sophisticated suspense
producing techniques. Directed
by Marshall and with Doris
Dowling and William Bendix.
Tomorrow evening at 7:30 in
Cubberley. Admission $1 (Stan
ford Film Society).
The Philadelphia Story One of
the three favorite films of
Katherine Hepburn fans, this
cocktail-society comedy pro
vided her with a role which fit
her like a glove. Cary Grant plays

the ex-husband, James Stewart;
the next husband, of an arch,!
baffling, unpredictable upper
crust femme fcitule. Stewart may
be a bit out of his depth, but
Cukor's direction is a strong
point. Saturday evening at 8 and
10 in kresge. Admission $1 (Law
School Film Society).
(
i
The Front Woody Allen tries]
valiantly to save Walter Herns-!
tein's script — and nearly sue-;
ceeds — but the comedy never
gels. The situation is aggravated
by director Ritt's flat pacing and
inability to impart life to his sub
ject. Sunday evening at 7 and
9:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
Admission $.50 (Sunday Flicks).
