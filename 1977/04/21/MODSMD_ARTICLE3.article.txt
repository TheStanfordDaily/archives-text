# Better than regular x-ray
## Med Center purchases body scanner 
### Jim Monen 
The University's first production
model whole body scanner is under
assembly in the Medical Center's new
wing and will begin operation around
May 1, according to Dr. George Harell,
assistant professor of radiology.
The unit, fully titled a "Whole Body
Computed Tomographic (CT) Scan
ner," was developed by Varian As
sociates, which is selling this latest
model to the Medical Center for
$610,000, according to Arnold El
dridge of Varian.
The device consists of a rotating

x-ray scanner and a computer which
processes the x-ray signals and pro
duces a three-dimensional image.
A patient is placed on a table in the
device's huge scanning drum, and the
x-ray source and receiver rotate at op
posite poles once every three seconds
as they travel down the drum. In this
way, a series of cross-sectional images
are produced and fed into the compu
ter. The computer then resolves the
density differences detected by the
scanner and creates a highly-detailed
image of the entire body.
The scanner's high density

resolving ability is its main advantage
over regular x-ray. With the conven
tional technique, density differences
of less than two per cent cannot be
detected.
Using a CT head scanner, which can
resolve naturally-occurring densities
of .5 per cent, a superior image is pro
duced with only the slight discomfort
of lying on a flat bed for five minutes.
Another advantage of the scanner is
its ability to locate tumors and cancer
ous tissue more accurately than regu
lar x-ray. As a result, therapeutic radia
tion can be applied more precisely to

the infected area, without damaging
nearby tissue.
The University has been working
closely with Varian and will continue
extensive research of its own. Harell
predicted that "one of Stanford's major
contributions will be improvement of
the whole body scanner."
Pre-production model scanners
have been in operation here and at
other hospitals around the nation for
about three years. But the new model
cuts x-ray production rotation time
from six to three seconds.
