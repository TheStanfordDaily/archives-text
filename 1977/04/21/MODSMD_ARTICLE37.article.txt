Terrorists elude FBI search
Sail F'rancisco — The FBI has been dogging
the trail of the New World Liberation Front
(NWLF) lor nearly three years, but admits little
success so far in smashing the bomb-and-run
terrorist group.
"We are conducting our investigation to de
termine who they are," says FBI spokesman
Frank Perrone. "With each bombing we hope
to learn more and more which might help pin
point who they are."
The NWLF first surfaced in August 1974,
taking responsibility for a bomb blast at Gen
eral Motors offices in Burlingame south of
here, and has kept active since.
The FBI lists 49 terrorist bombings in the San
Francisco Bay area in 1975 and 1976. The
NWLF claimed responsibility for 28 of them.
The FBI said many of the bombings were un
claimed and a number of "one-shot" radical
groups took responsibility for others.
No one has been killed or injured as a result
of bombings acknowledged by the NWLF.
Recent attacks have centered on the Pacific
Gas & Electric Go,, which has been bombed
three times in the past 10 days, each incident
causing major damage to company transformer
stations. PG&E serves most of Northern and
central California.
The terrorists have demanded that PG&E
provide free electricity for the poor and elderly
on fixed incomes and that the utility stop seek
ing rate increases.
Another favorite target is the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors, the city's equivalent of a
city council, and various city officials. Bombs
have exploded at two supervisors' homes and

demands have followed for improved jail con
ditions.
Northwest faces energy rationing
Helena, Mont. — Officials say the Pacific
Northwest's seven million people face the
likelihood of stringent controls on electricity
usage this fall. Drought has dried up the water
for hydroelectric dams and voluntary conser
vation has not worked.
A proposal for mandatory controls was
drawn up Tuesday by representatives of the
area's governors, meeting as the Northwest
Electricity Task Force. The plan is to be pre
sented to the governors for review, but they are
not expected to act on it until the commission's
next meeting in May or June.
The first stage of mandatory controls would
restrict hours for retail shopping and commer
cial activity, prohibit most lighting for night
time sporting events, decorative purposes and
parking lots, restrict store signs and window
displays to nighttime business hours — which
also should be reduced — and ban the electri
cal heating of swimming pools.
Stage two, affecting all customers, could fol
low within a month or so, according to calcula
tions by Merrill Schultz of the Northwest
Power Pool.
Those would require "all customers" — re
sidential, commercial and industrial — to cut
consumption by "the percentage declared
necessary for the region to bring anticipated
resources and requirements into balance."
A third stage proposed by the group would
be even more drastic — rotating interruptions
of electrical service, probably for a few hours at

a time. Some large industrial users would be
ordered to cut usage by a certain percentage,
and some would be ordered to shut down.
The task force meeting, held here, came only
two months after a call in mid-February for
voluntary cutbacks of 10 per cent regionwide.
The task force was told only 32 per cent of that
goal has been reached.
Now, Schultz estimates, the 112 region has a
50-50 chance ot needing the mandatory con
trols.
House vote forbids Arab boycott
Washington — The House yesterday passed
legislation banning American companies and
their subsidiaries from cooperating in the Arab
boycott of Israel.
The trade export control bill also would im
pose a two-year ban on any export of Alaskan
crude oil and would ban any presidential em
bargo on agricultural exports unless Congress
approves.
Current U.S. policy just encourages Ameri
can businessmen to refuse to cooperate in the
Arab boycott.
Lawyer claims Nixon wronged
Washington — Richard Nixon's lawyer,
Herbert Miller, told the Supreme Court yester
day that Nixon's constitutional right to privacy
clearly is trampled by government seizure of
theformer president's tapes and papersand the
prospect of archivists rummaging through
them.
And, he warned, if a 1974 law directing the
seizure is allowed to stand, not even the jus
tices' own documents would be safe if Con

gress should choose to take them.
The possession and control of 42 million
pages of documents and 5000 hours of tape
generated by the Nixon administration have
been fought over in the courts since Nixon
resigned on Aug. 9, 1974.
The Supreme Court must decide whether
Congress had the constitutional right to pass
the law which, for the first time in the 200 years
of nationhood, deprived a president of his pap
ers.
Congress decided Nixon was an unreliable
custodian because of such incidents as the
18V2-minute gap in one tape recording and
numerous errors and omissions in transcrip
tions of tapes turned over to Congress.
Court rules slogans not required
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled
yesterday that drivers are not required to dis
play ideological messages such as "Live Free
or Die" that states put on auto license plates.
Using one family's objection to that motto on
New Hampshire license plates, the Supreme
Court said an individual can refuse to display
the messages on auto plates or other personal
property.
"We are faced with the question of whether a
state may constitutionally require an indi
vidual to participate in the dissemination of an
ideological message," the 7 to 2 majority of the
court said. "We hold that the state may not do
so."
The decision opens the door for citizens to
challenge slogans of other states such as North
Carolina, which displays "First in Freedom"
on its license plates. Whether it would apply to

Illinois, which stamps "Land of Lincoln" on its
plates, or other states with seemingly innocu
ous mottoes on license plates is not clear.
The court's opinion, written by Chief )ustice
Warren Burger, said New Hampshire residents
George and Maxine Maynard should not have
been forced to advertise a slogan they found
morally, ethically and religiously repugnant
because their beliefs are protected by the First
Amendment.
