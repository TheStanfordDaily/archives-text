# Tenure: a long administrative process
## Seeking excellence in research and teaching 
### Kathy Trafton 
It's a search for professors who are
both "research stars and teaching
stars," according to Norman Wessels,
chairman of the Biological Sciences
Department.
It's an "up or out process" according
to Provost William Miller.
Regardless of how it — the tenure
process — is viewed, tenure is some
thing that gets people here excited.
Generally, a faculty member attains
a tenure appointment through a
lengthy administrative process. "A fa
culty member who survives this pro
cess must be an impressive person,"
said Larry Diamond, chairperson of
the ASSU Task Force on Tenure and
Teaching Quality.
In certain circumstances, tenure is
instead automatically granted because
of length of service by a faculty
member. This rarely occurs, though.
'Some kind of status'
According to John Linvill, associate
dean of engineering, one must have
"attained some kind of status in the
profession" in order to be considered
for tenure.
The Electrical Engineering Depart
ment strives to achieve an overall ba
lance between faculty members who
are skilled at teaching and members
who are skilled at researching. Each
professor, however, need not be tops at

both, Linvill said.
The department provides oppor
tunities for all kinds, and it is therefore
flexible. "We try to have complemen
tarity," Linvill said.
Each professor should be somewhat
balanced as a teacher and a researcher,
Wessells said. "If we had a star in re
search who was abysmally dismal in
teaching, we wouldn't take him," he
explained. "Also, if a professor's re
search is weak, no matter how good a
teacher he is, we probably wouldn't
vote him in."
'Dried-out teachers'
Wessells noted that there seems to
be a lack of research ability in old,
dried-out teachers. "We're in a field
that's moving. We're afraid of teaching
courses that are out of date." If a pro
fessor has a tendency to drop behind
intellectually, then the department
does not want him. he said.
There are five points where a nega
tive decision can be made on a candi
date's tenure.
Although some are already granted
tenure when they come to the depart
ment. the tenure time clock typically
begins when a person is first ap
pointed, Linvill said. A reappointment
is made three years later after the de
partment is satisfied that he is the most
qualified candidate for the position he
holds. Associate professors are re

viewed every five years in the En
gineering Department.
Before the seventh year, "it is clear
to me and to my colleagues what the
prospects are for a given faculty
member," Linvill said. A faculty
member must leave if he has not been
granted tenure within seven years.
Junior faculty
The Biological Sciences Department
does not hire junior faculty unless
there is a potential permanent slot for
them within six years. "We only hire
people who are in a tenure line slot. If
they prove to be good enough then
they have a shot at tenure. We don't
hire people in competition with one
another for one slot." Wessells said.
Wessells said he appoints a commit
tee consisting of three faculty mem
bers, one graduate student and one
undergraduate to gather information
on the candidate. The committee then
writes a recommendation to the te
nured faculty members of the depart
ment.
The tenured faculty members meet,
review the candidate's credentials and
decide whether to recommend him for
tenure.
"I can't remember a case where
we've had a split vote in the Executive
Committee of the Electrical Engineer
ing Department. If we did, the majori
ty's decision would stand, but the split

would be transmitted to the next level
up," Linvill said.
To the dean
If the candidate has passed this
stage, his file goes to the dean of the
school. Both the dean's staff and the
school's Appointments and Promo
tions Committee review the file. They
make a recommendation to the dean,
who usually acts in accordance with
the recommendation.
If*the dean recommends tenure, the
file continues upward to the provost,
the president, and ultimately to the
advisory hoard of the faculty senate.
If at any point the candidate is not
recommended for tenure, he is denied
tenure unless he appeals the decision.
"If a faculty member believes he's
had an adverse decision, he may ap
peal up the administrative structure,"
Miller said.
If a candidate is turned down by his
department, he may appeal to the
dean. If the decision of the department
is sustained by the dean, further ap
peal may be made to the provost, pres
ident and advisory board.
Most appeals are not successful and
do not reach the advisory board, Miller
said. If a lot of appeals had succeeded,
he said, there might be some indica
tion the tenure evaluations process is
not satisfactory.

Don't pave our lawn!
Approximately 75 Roble Hall residents protested yesterday against having
their front lawn paved over. Residents said they were never notified that the
work was going to be done. They will meet with Acting Assoc. Dean Norman
Robinson before any more work is done.

"attained some kind of status in the
profession" in order to be considered
for tenure.
The Electrical Engineering Depart
ment strives to achieve an overall ba
lance between faculty members who
are skilled at teaching and members
who are skilled at researching. Each
professor, however, need not be tops at

both, Linvill said.
The department provides oppor
tunities for all kinds, and it is therefore
flexible. "We try to have complemen
tarity," Linvill said.
Each professor should be somewhat
balanced as a teacher and a researcher,
Wessells said. "If we had a star in re
search who was abysmally dismal in
teaching, we wouldn't take him," he
explained. "Also, if a professor's re
search is weak, no matter how good a
teacher he is, we probably wouldn't
vote him in."
'Dried-out teachers'
Wessells noted that there seems to
be a lack of research ability in old,
dried-out teachers. "We're in a field
that's moving. We're afraid of teaching
courses that are out of date." If a pro
fessor has a tendency to drop behind
intellectually, then the department
does not want him. he said.
There are five points where a nega
tive decision can be made on a candi
date's tenure.
Although some are already granted
tenure when they come to the depart
ment. the tenure time clock typically
begins when a person is first ap
pointed, Linvill said. A reappointment
is made three years later after the de
partment is satisfied that he is the most
qualified candidate for the position he
holds. Associate professors are re

viewed every five years in the En
gineering Department.
Before the seventh year, "it is clear
to me and to my colleagues what the
prospects are for a given faculty
member," Linvill said. A faculty
member must leave if he has not been
granted tenure within seven years.
Junior faculty
The Biological Sciences Department
does not hire junior faculty unless
there is a potential permanent slot for
them within six years. "We only hire
people who are in a tenure line slot. If
they prove to be good enough then
they have a shot at tenure. We don't
hire people in competition with one
another for one slot." Wessells said.
Wessells said he appoints a commit
tee consisting of three faculty mem
bers, one graduate student and one
undergraduate to gather information
on the candidate. The committee then
writes a recommendation to the te
nured faculty members of the depart
ment.
The tenured faculty members meet,
review the candidate's credentials and
decide whether to recommend him for
tenure.
"I can't remember a case where
we've had a split vote in the Executive
Committee of the Electrical Engineer
ing Department. If we did, the majori
ty's decision would stand, but the split

would be transmitted to the next level
up," Linvill said.
To the dean
If the candidate has passed this
stage, his file goes to the dean of the
school. Both the dean's staff and the
school's Appointments and Promo
tions Committee review the file. They
make a recommendation to the dean,
who usually acts in accordance with
the recommendation.
If*the dean recommends tenure, the
file continues upward to the provost,
the president, and ultimately to the
advisory hoard of the faculty senate.
If at any point the candidate is not
recommended for tenure, he is denied
tenure unless he appeals the decision.
"If a faculty member believes he's
had an adverse decision, he may ap
peal up the administrative structure,"
Miller said.
If a candidate is turned down by his
department, he may appeal to the
dean. If the decision of the department
is sustained by the dean, further ap
peal may be made to the provost, pres
ident and advisory board.
Most appeals are not successful and
do not reach the advisory board, Miller
said. If a lot of appeals had succeeded,
he said, there might be some indica
tion the tenure evaluations process is
not satisfactory.

Don't pave our lawn!
Approximately 75 Roble Hall residents protested yesterday against having
their front lawn paved over. Residents said they were never notified that the
work was going to be done. They will meet with Acting Assoc. Dean Norman
Robinson before any more work is done.
It's a search for professors who are
both "research stars and teaching
stars," according to Norman Wessels,
chairman of the Biological Sciences
Department.
It's an "up or out process" according
to Provost William Miller.
Regardless of how it — the tenure
process — is viewed, tenure is some
thing that gets people here excited.
Generally, a faculty member attains
a tenure appointment through a
lengthy administrative process. "A fa
culty member who survives this pro
cess must be an impressive person,"
said Larry Diamond, chairperson of
the ASSU Task Force on Tenure and
Teaching Quality.
In certain circumstances, tenure is
instead automatically granted because
of length of service by a faculty
member. This rarely occurs, though.

'Dried-out teachers'
Wessells noted that there seems to
be a lack of research ability in old,
dried-out teachers. "We're in a field
that's moving. We're afraid of teaching
courses that are out of date." If a pro
fessor has a tendency to drop behind
intellectually, then the department
does not want him. he said.
There are five points where a nega
tive decision can be made on a candi
date's tenure.
Although some are already granted
tenure when they come to the depart
ment. the tenure time clock typically
begins when a person is first ap
pointed, Linvill said. A reappointment
is made three years later after the de
partment is satisfied that he is the most
qualified candidate for the position he
holds. Associate professors are re

viewed every five years in the En
gineering Department.
Before the seventh year, "it is clear
to me and to my colleagues what the
prospects are for a given faculty
member," Linvill said. A faculty
member must leave if he has not been
granted tenure within seven years.
Junior faculty
The Biological Sciences Department
does not hire junior faculty unless
there is a potential permanent slot for
them within six years. "We only hire
people who are in a tenure line slot. If
they prove to be good enough then
they have a shot at tenure. We don't
hire people in competition with one
another for one slot." Wessells said.
Wessells said he appoints a commit
tee consisting of three faculty mem
bers, one graduate student and one
undergraduate to gather information
on the candidate. The committee then
writes a recommendation to the te
nured faculty members of the depart
ment.
The tenured faculty members meet,
review the candidate's credentials and
decide whether to recommend him for
tenure.
"I can't remember a case where
we've had a split vote in the Executive
Committee of the Electrical Engineer
ing Department. If we did, the majori
ty's decision would stand, but the split

would be transmitted to the next level
up," Linvill said.
To the dean
If the candidate has passed this
stage, his file goes to the dean of the
school. Both the dean's staff and the
school's Appointments and Promo
tions Committee review the file. They
make a recommendation to the dean,
who usually acts in accordance with
the recommendation.
If*the dean recommends tenure, the
file continues upward to the provost,
the president, and ultimately to the
advisory hoard of the faculty senate.
If at any point the candidate is not
recommended for tenure, he is denied
tenure unless he appeals the decision.
"If a faculty member believes he's
had an adverse decision, he may ap
peal up the administrative structure,"
Miller said.
If a candidate is turned down by his
department, he may appeal to the
dean. If the decision of the department
is sustained by the dean, further ap
peal may be made to the provost, pres
ident and advisory board.
Most appeals are not successful and
do not reach the advisory board, Miller
said. If a lot of appeals had succeeded,
he said, there might be some indica
tion the tenure evaluations process is
not satisfactory.

Don't pave our lawn!
Approximately 75 Roble Hall residents protested yesterday against having
their front lawn paved over. Residents said they were never notified that the
work was going to be done. They will meet with Acting Assoc. Dean Norman
Robinson before any more work is done.
