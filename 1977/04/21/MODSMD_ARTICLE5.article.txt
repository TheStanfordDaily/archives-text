# Carter's energy plan: price, tax increases
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter asked a hushed Congress
last night to enact a national energy
policy that raises prices and taxes for
energy and automobiles to encourage
conservation of dwindling resources.
"VVith the exception of preventing
war, this is the greatest challenge our
country will face during our
lifetimes," Carter told a joint session of
the Senate and House in a nationally
broadcast address.
Carter told the legislators, already
divided by allegiance to different reg
ions and interests, that he has learned
why a comprehensive energy policy
has not already been developed.
"It is a thankless job," Carter said,
"but it is our job, and I believe we have
a fair, well-balanced and effective plan
to present to you."
Tax gas-guzzlers
He urged enactment of legislation
that would tax gas-guzzling autos
anywhere from $449 for 1978 low
mileage models up to $2488 for 1985.
And he asked the lawmakers to ap
prove a plan that would add about
seven cents a gallon to the cost of
gasoline, fuel oil and other petroleum
products by 1980 through a series of
taxes on crude oil.
Carter's program threatened further
gasoline taxes starting at five cents a
gullon in 1979 as rising as high as 50
cents a gallon if U.S. gasoline con

sumption is not held down.
U.S. gasoline prices now are about
60 cents a gallon for regular, including
four cents of federal tax. By compari
son, the price in Creat Britain is about
$1.60 a gallon.
"1 don't expect much applause,"
Carter said near the start of his ill
minute speech. And he didn't get
much after receiving a warm round
when he entered the House chamber
where members of Congress, dip
lomats and officials awaited him and
where his family looked on.
Applause
The president was almost 20 mi
nutes into his speech when his state
ment that "immediate and total decon
trol of domestic oil and gas prices
would be disastrous" brought the first
round of handclapping. The next came
when he said producers should not be
allowed windfall profits.
In all, his speech was interrupted
eight times by applause.
But the political difficulties Carter
will face in having his proposals em
bodied in law showed clearly in the
first congressional reaction.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill said
Carter knows "this is his first major
fight." Other disagreements with
members of Congress, O'Neill said,
"were mere skirmishes. This is a bat
tle."
O'Neill said the gasoline tax would
be the hardest to get through Congress
and he personally did not see how it
would work to conserve gasoline.
Energy plan
Here are the major elements of Car
ter's energy plan as outlined before a
joint address to Congress last night:
—A standby gasoline tax increase,
starting at five cents per gallon and
rising to 50 cents after 10 years if
gasoline consumption fails to decline.
—A tax rising to a maximum $2488
by 1986 on each gas-guzzling car, ac
companied by a rebate of up to $493 for
fuel-efficient cars.
—Tax credits of up to $410 for
homeowners who insulate their
houses or take other steps to make their
residences more energy-efficient.
—Tax credits of up to $2000 for
homeowners who install solar heating
and cooling devices.
—Mandatory efficiency standards
on new appliances such as air

conditioners, furnaces, water heaters
and refrigerators.
—Forbidding utilities from charg
ing lower rates to industries and
businesses which use large amounts of
electricity or natural gas.
—Imposing a new tax on crude oil in
addition to the hike in gasoline taxes.
The crude oil tax could raise the price
of gasoline another seven cents per
gallon.
—Returning increased oil and
gasoline taxfis to consumers through a
federal tax rebate, likely starting at $15
and rising to $25. The rebate is in
tended to compensate low income
families hit hard by sharply higher
energy costs.
—Permitting all domestic crude oil
prices to rise to the current world
price, about $13 a barrel.
