# Residents stop Roble landscaping
## 
### 
Work on a landscaping project in
front of Roble Hall was halted yester
day after about 75 residents of the
dorm gathered to protest the paving
over of the front lawn.
The protest started just before noon
when residents returned from class
and found a tractor tearing up a small
triangle of grass. House associates at
the protest said that no one in the dorm
was told the landscaping work would
be done.
Norman Robinson, acting associate
dean of students, said that his office
had not been notified that the work
was scheduled and that he was "a bit
surprised" when he found out about it.
Robinson said the problem stemmed
from a "lack of communication" but
added that he was "not sure yet"
where the breakdown came.
Normally, he said, if any changes are
proposed that affect the housing sys
tem, "we would be consulted along
with the people in the dorms at the
stage when we're discussing what to
do."
Robinson added that he planned to
set up a meeting with students in the
dorm to "talk about what was sup
posed to happen and what will hap
pen."
Student sentiment at the protest was
unanimous in favor of replanting the
area with grass and Robinson later said
that he was "not all that happy about
paving over the front of Roble."
Robinson has postponed work on
the landscaping project until a deci
sion is made on whether to replant the
grass or to pave it over as planned.
The Roble project is part of a project
to upgrade the areas around student
residences by installing automatic
sprinkler systems. David Haskins,
house fellow in Roble, said "plant ser
vices told me this was an economy
move to save labor."
Sprinkler systems will be installed
at Lagunita Court, and Hurlburt ac
cording to plans obtained by the Daily.
