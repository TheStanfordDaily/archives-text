## Opinions Investment aids apartheid 
###

tThis is part one of a two-part
column on University invest
ment responsibility.)
How would you feel to know
that the quality of your Stanford
education is being enhanced by
the blood, sweat and tears —
literally—of the super-exploited
black majority in South Africa?
We believe this is the case; the
trustees —at least as indicated by
their actions —feel otherwise.
When Peter Bing, president of
the Board of Trustees, spoke to
125 protesters last Tuesday, be
agreed that the whole Stanford
community finds South African
apartheid abhorrent. Yet, the
University is deeply embroiled
in South Africa, owning nearly
900,000 shares, worth more than
$41 million, in nine companies
that have significant invest
ments in South Africa.
The University has been pre
sented with an opportunity
through stockholder resolu
tions, to have these nine com
panies either withdraw from
South Africa or stop any further
investment. The board, how
ever, has relinquished this op
portunity by abstaining on the
University's proxy votes for all
these resolutions.
In order to vote yes on a proxy,
three criteria must be met. The
undesirable acts or effects of the
company must be substantial;
substantial consensus exists in
the community on the undesira
bility of the acts or effects in
question; and the economic
costs to the University of taking
action are commensurate with
the probable effects of that ac
tion.
In today's article, we shall deal
with the first of these criteria: the
acts and effects of the company.
Tomorrow we will go on to dis
cuss the question of consensus
within the community and how
we feel the University should
deal with its South African in
vestments.
Bing has stated that the trus
tees decided to abstain on the
proxy votes because they be
lieved U.S. corporations can and

do play a progressive role in
South Africa, and therefore
should not pull out. However,
the University's own sources
contradict this claim.
The Investor Responsibility
Research Center, Inc., which is
funded by the University and
other institutional investors, has
done extensive research on the
U.S. business role in South Af
rica. The center concludes in its
report that "...the bulk of Ameri
can companies doing business
in South Africa probably are no
more innovative than South Af
rican or British or other foreign
business."
The author of this report, De
saix Meyers, was flown out from
the East Coast by the University
to participate in investment
forums here. Meyers was told by
David Jackson, executive direc
tor of the Institute of Personal
Management,' that American
companies generally are no
more progressive than indigen
ous South African companies.
Finally, Charles St. Thomas, an
American management consul
tant, found in his survey that
there is "little difference bet
ween American managers and
their South African counter
parts."
Even if it were true that
American companies were try
ing to improve conditions for the
blacks in South Africa, present
trends would demonstrate the
utt3r failure of their efforts.
Wage gap
The wage gap between blacks
and whites is widening; the "re
settlement" program is ac
celerating; police power is being
employed more and more rep
ressively. Meanwhile, American
investment continues to grow.
American involvement repre
sents 16 per cent of all private
investment in South Africa. The
total investment of 350 U.S. sub
sidiaries adds up to $1.5 billion.
U.S. banks recently loaned $2
billion, in part to protect earlier
loans and U.S. companies al
ready in South Africa, and in

part to provide direct aid to the
racist Vorster regime.
Opponents to American cor
porate withdrawal claim that
such action would not affect
South Africa or that it might
even strengthen it. Why then
does South Africa offer special
terms to foreign capital? Why
does the South African govern
ment advertise for U.S. invest
ment? Indeed, why was one of
the first responses to the Soweto
uprising last June, according to
the New York Times, a "new
multimillion dollar public rela
tions effort overseas—
particularly in the United
States"?
Investment needed
The answer should be clear.
South Africa's developed in
dustrial economy needs con
tinual foreign investment for a
number of reasons, not the least
of which is to provide revenue
for the massive military/police
budget which was just boosted
21 per cent to $2 billion.
Investment is also needed to
compensate for a poor balance of
payments (a 400 million deficit
with the U.S. in 1974). Finally,
South Africa needs American
technology for such things as
police computers (IBM), self
sufficient oil refining capacity
(Caltex), and communication
hardware (GE).
Thus, it becomes clear that
conditions for blacks are de
teriorating in South Africa, that
American qompanies are doing
little to counteract this decline,
and that American support is
crucial to the maintainence of
apartheid. Given the over
whelming evidence supporting
these propositions, the sincerity
of the University's claim that it
opposes American withdrawl
from South Africa in order to
promote progress in that country
must be seriously questioned.

South Africa's developed in
dustrial economy needs con
tinual foreign investment for a
number of reasons, not the least
of which is to provide revenue
for the massive military/police
budget which was just boosted
21 per cent to $2 billion.
Investment is also needed to
compensate for a poor balance of
payments (a 400 million deficit
with the U.S. in 1974). Finally,
South Africa needs American
technology for such things as
police computers (IBM), self
sufficient oil refining capacity
(Caltex), and communication
hardware (GE).
Thus, it becomes clear that
conditions for blacks are de
teriorating in South Africa, that
American qompanies are doing
little to counteract this decline,
and that American support is
crucial to the maintainence of
apartheid. Given the over
whelming evidence supporting
these propositions, the sincerity
of the University's claim that it
opposes American withdrawl
from South Africa in order to
promote progress in that country
must be seriously questioned.

How would you feel to know
that the quality of your Stanford
education is being enhanced by
the blood, sweat and tears —
literally—of the super-exploited
black majority in South Africa?
We believe this is the case; the
trustees —at least as indicated by
their actions —feel otherwise.
When Peter Bing, president of
the Board of Trustees, spoke to
125 protesters last Tuesday, be
agreed that the whole Stanford
community finds South African
apartheid abhorrent. Yet, the
University is deeply embroiled
in South Africa, owning nearly
900,000 shares, worth more than
$41 million, in nine companies
that have significant invest
ments in South Africa.
The University has been pre
sented with an opportunity
through stockholder resolu
tions, to have these nine com
panies either withdraw from
South Africa or stop any further
investment. The board, how
ever, has relinquished this op
portunity by abstaining on the
University's proxy votes for all
these resolutions.
In order to vote yes on a proxy,
three criteria must be met. The
undesirable acts or effects of the
company must be substantial;
substantial consensus exists in
the community on the undesira
bility of the acts or effects in
question; and the economic
costs to the University of taking
action are commensurate with
the probable effects of that ac
tion.
In today's article, we shall deal
with the first of these criteria: the
acts and effects of the company.
Tomorrow we will go on to dis
cuss the question of consensus
within the community and how
we feel the University should
deal with its South African in
vestments.
Bing has stated that the trus
tees decided to abstain on the
proxy votes because they be
lieved U.S. corporations can and

do play a progressive role in
South Africa, and therefore
should not pull out. However,
the University's own sources
contradict this claim.
The Investor Responsibility
Research Center, Inc., which is
funded by the University and
other institutional investors, has
done extensive research on the
U.S. business role in South Af
rica. The center concludes in its
report that "...the bulk of Ameri
can companies doing business
in South Africa probably are no
more innovative than South Af
rican or British or other foreign
business."
The author of this report, De
saix Meyers, was flown out from
the East Coast by the University
to participate in investment
forums here. Meyers was told by
David Jackson, executive direc
tor of the Institute of Personal
Management,' that American
companies generally are no
more progressive than indigen
ous South African companies.
Finally, Charles St. Thomas, an
American management consul
tant, found in his survey that
there is "little difference bet
ween American managers and
their South African counter
parts."
Even if it were true that
American companies were try
ing to improve conditions for the
blacks in South Africa, present
trends would demonstrate the
utt3r failure of their efforts.
Wage gap
The wage gap between blacks
and whites is widening; the "re
settlement" program is ac
celerating; police power is being
employed more and more rep
ressively. Meanwhile, American
investment continues to grow.
American involvement repre
sents 16 per cent of all private
investment in South Africa. The
total investment of 350 U.S. sub
sidiaries adds up to $1.5 billion.
U.S. banks recently loaned $2
billion, in part to protect earlier
loans and U.S. companies al
ready in South Africa, and in

part to provide direct aid to the
racist Vorster regime.
Opponents to American cor
porate withdrawal claim that
such action would not affect
South Africa or that it might
even strengthen it. Why then
does South Africa offer special
terms to foreign capital? Why
does the South African govern
ment advertise for U.S. invest
ment? Indeed, why was one of
the first responses to the Soweto
uprising last June, according to
the New York Times, a "new
multimillion dollar public rela
tions effort overseas—
particularly in the United
States"?

settlement" program is ac
celerating; police power is being
employed more and more rep
ressively. Meanwhile, American
investment continues to grow.
American involvement repre
sents 16 per cent of all private
investment in South Africa. The
total investment of 350 U.S. sub
sidiaries adds up to $1.5 billion.
U.S. banks recently loaned $2
billion, in part to protect earlier
loans and U.S. companies al
ready in South Africa, and in

part to provide direct aid to the
racist Vorster regime.
Opponents to American cor
porate withdrawal claim that
such action would not affect
South Africa or that it might
even strengthen it. Why then
does South Africa offer special
terms to foreign capital? Why
does the South African govern
ment advertise for U.S. invest
ment? Indeed, why was one of
the first responses to the Soweto
uprising last June, according to
the New York Times, a "new
multimillion dollar public rela
tions effort overseas—
particularly in the United
States"?
Investment needed
The answer should be clear.
South Africa's developed in
dustrial economy needs con
tinual foreign investment for a
number of reasons, not the least
of which is to provide revenue
for the massive military/police
budget which was just boosted
21 per cent to $2 billion.
Investment is also needed to
compensate for a poor balance of
payments (a 400 million deficit
with the U.S. in 1974). Finally,
South Africa needs American
technology for such things as
police computers (IBM), self
sufficient oil refining capacity
(Caltex), and communication
hardware (GE).
Thus, it becomes clear that
conditions for blacks are de
teriorating in South Africa, that
American qompanies are doing
little to counteract this decline,
and that American support is
crucial to the maintainence of
apartheid. Given the over
whelming evidence supporting
these propositions, the sincerity
of the University's claim that it
opposes American withdrawl
from South Africa in order to
promote progress in that country
must be seriously questioned.

tThis is part one of a two-part
column on University invest
ment responsibility.)
How would you feel to know
that the quality of your Stanford
education is being enhanced by
the blood, sweat and tears —
literally—of the super-exploited
black majority in South Africa?
We believe this is the case; the
trustees —at least as indicated by
their actions —feel otherwise.
When Peter Bing, president of
the Board of Trustees, spoke to
125 protesters last Tuesday, be
agreed that the whole Stanford
community finds South African
apartheid abhorrent. Yet, the
University is deeply embroiled
in South Africa, owning nearly
900,000 shares, worth more than
$41 million, in nine companies
that have significant invest
ments in South Africa.
The University has been pre
sented with an opportunity
through stockholder resolu
tions, to have these nine com
panies either withdraw from
South Africa or stop any further
investment. The board, how
ever, has relinquished this op
portunity by abstaining on the
University's proxy votes for all
these resolutions.
In order to vote yes on a proxy,
three criteria must be met. The
undesirable acts or effects of the
company must be substantial;
substantial consensus exists in
the community on the undesira
bility of the acts or effects in
question; and the economic
costs to the University of taking
action are commensurate with
the probable effects of that ac
tion.
In today's article, we shall deal
with the first of these criteria: the
acts and effects of the company.
Tomorrow we will go on to dis
cuss the question of consensus
within the community and how
we feel the University should
deal with its South African in
vestments.
Bing has stated that the trus
tees decided to abstain on the
proxy votes because they be
lieved U.S. corporations can and

do play a progressive role in
South Africa, and therefore
should not pull out. However,
the University's own sources
contradict this claim.
The Investor Responsibility
Research Center, Inc., which is
funded by the University and
other institutional investors, has
done extensive research on the
U.S. business role in South Af
rica. The center concludes in its
report that "...the bulk of Ameri
can companies doing business
in South Africa probably are no
more innovative than South Af
rican or British or other foreign
business."
The author of this report, De
saix Meyers, was flown out from
the East Coast by the University
to participate in investment
forums here. Meyers was told by
David Jackson, executive direc
tor of the Institute of Personal
Management,' that American
companies generally are no
more progressive than indigen
ous South African companies.
Finally, Charles St. Thomas, an
American management consul
tant, found in his survey that
there is "little difference bet
ween American managers and
their South African counter
parts."
Even if it were true that
American companies were try
ing to improve conditions for the
blacks in South Africa, present
trends would demonstrate the
utt3r failure of their efforts.

and whites is widening; the "re
