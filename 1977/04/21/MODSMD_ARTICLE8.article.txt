Facts
On Friday, April 15. the Daily published
an article entitled "TV Series on Italy 'Super
ficial,'" which, quite gratuitously, accused
me of saying silly things about Italy on tele
vision. Fortunately, I have kept the text of my
remarks, so that anyone interested may
judge their factual accuracy and literary
quality.
The authors say that I compared Porci con
le ali (Pigs with wings) with the master
pieces of Italian literature. This comparison
has not been made by me but by left-wing
Italian publications and reported in the
American press. But the main point of by
commentary was that this much-touted book
is mere pornography and unworthy of the
comparison.
The authors also attribute to me an evalua
tion of the Italian Socialist Party's motives
which I simply never made. Because the

Socialist Party contains so many tendencies,
each of its acts is moved by innumerable
contrasting intentions. It is undeniable,
however, that the socialists did help to open
the way to the communists' present role in
the country and that, day after day', they pub
licly press the Christian Democrats to give
the communists an even greater one.
Moreover, the authors identify me
wrongly. Indeed, nothing they say is accu
rate other than the statement that Italy is
"dominated by violence, chaos, strikes and
spreading leftism."
In their rush to discredit someone who
disagrees with them, the authors did not
bother with facts. They have given readers a
taste of what happens to those in Italy who
disagree with current trends.
