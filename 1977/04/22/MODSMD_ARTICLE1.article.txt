## Prof censured 
### Jordan Lorence 
President Richard Lyman has
sent a letter to Assoc. Anatomy Prof.
Donald Stilwell, censuring him for
professional misconduct, accord
ing to the University News Service.
The censure concerns allegations
that Stilwell sent a letter of recom
mendation to medical schools dis
cussing about 40 students without
the students' knowledge or permis
sion.
"A letter of censure is official in
dication of institutional disap
proval (of some faculty member's
action)," said James Siena, legal
adviser to the president.
Siena added censure is serious
and rarely done.
"No one has been censured dur
ing my seven years here," Siena
said.
The controversy began last fall
when an unidentified source gave a
copy of the letter to Robert
Hamrdla, assistant dean of under
graduate studies and director of the
Academic Information Center
(AIC). The AIC notified the students
involved.

Some of the students then signed
affidavits stating the letter was un
solicited by them and asking the
AIC to alert the appropriate medical
schools that the letter was not writ
ten by Stilwell in an official capac
ity.
refused to comment to
the Daily.
According to the University
News Service, an agreement was
worked out between attorneys for
Stilwell and the University under
the terms of the University's State
ment on Faculty Discipline.
Stilwell has agreed to refrain
from calling himself an adviser,
premedical or otherwise, according
to the news service. The news ser
vice said Stilwell has also agreed to
notify any student about whom he
writes in the future, unless the stu
dent has previously requested a re
commendation.
Stilwell will also send an annual
report to the dean of undergraduate
studies, listing the students for
whom he wrote letters and noting
which students requested the let
ters, the news service reported.
