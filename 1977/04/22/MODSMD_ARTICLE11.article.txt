# Investment aids apartheid

Gray, Jennings

(This is part two of a two-part column on
University investment responsibility.)
In yesterday's article, on the University's
investment policy, we dealt with the first of
the three criteria which are used to deter
mine how the University should vote on
shareholder resolutions. We demonstrated
how there can be no doubt that "the undesir
able acts or effect of the company are sub
stantial" when one is considering American
corporate presence in South Africa.
The second criteria mandates that before
the University can support a shareholder re
solution, "substantial consensus exists in
the community on the undesirability of the
acts or effects in question." By voting to abs
tain on all the shareholder resolutions cal
ling for non-expansion or withdrawal of
American companies from South Africa, the
trustees apparently decided consensus in
support of the resolutions did not exist here.
Like their conclusion on the first criteria, we
must here again seriously question the trus
tees' judgment.
Proxy votes for shareholder resolutions
are processed by an elaborate system. First
an advisory committee makes recommenda
tions to Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance. Augsburger in turn
makes recommendations to the trustees. The
trustees then make the actual decision.
The inadequacy of this system in deter
mining any of the three criteria, but espe
cially the one calling for a consensus, can be
seen in the case of the J.P. Stevens sharehol
der resolution that came up last quarter. De
spite the advisory committee's recommen
dation that the University vote yes on the
resolution, and the demonstration through

petitions of widespread community support
for the resolution, the University decided to
abstain.
Failing to get recognition of community
consensus through all th legitimate channels
set up, a number of protesters staged a sit-in
in Augsburger office. Though the University
failed to change its vote on the J.P. Stevens
resolution, it did grant one of the demands of
those sitting in: to hold a forum on corporate
responsibility.
The major issue before that forum, held
two weeks ago, is the issue still before us:
how is the University going to vote on the
shareholder resolutions concerning South
Africa?
The University would like us to believe
that abstaining on the proxy votes—instead
of actually voting against them—and writing
"letters of concern" will ultimately do the
most good for South African blacks by mak
ing American companies more "progres
sive" in that country. However, abstaining
on a proxy is not a neutral act. Abstention
means that the abstainer agrees with the
majority—in these cases, that will be man
agement, since these resolutions have little
chance of passing at this point. The impact of
such a vote can only be to support the status
quo.
As for the"letters of concern," there is no
evidence that chiding letters have any effect
on multi-million dollar international con
glomerates like General Electric, Standard
Oil or General Motors.
Augsburger's letter to J.P. Stevens elicited
an arrogant reply basically calling him a
dupe of ignorant students.
So, the question remains: what is to be

done? The Stanford Coalition for Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP) is presently
circulating petitions calling for an affirma
tive vote on the resolutions.
Bing told us that the trustees would recon
sider the issue if we could show community
consensus in favor of the resolutions. We
urge you to sign this petition.
In summary, we would like to present
three distinct arguments for supporting this
petition, and further argue something that is
not advocated on the petition: if the resolu
tions fail to pass, the University divests itself
of the stock it holds in those companies.
The first, more moderate argument is that
the University's actions in themselves could
never force these companies to withdraw
from South Africa. Voting for these resolu
tions is just a way to get these corporations to
seriously re-examine their practices in South
Africa.
The second, probably the more far-sighted
argument recognizes that mere reform is no
longer possible or adequate in South Africa.
Events are moving too quickly. The white
minority rule in Rhodesia is collapsing.
In light of these trends, one should see the
University's vote for the resolutions—and
divestment if they fail—as the first major
step to end all foreign investment in South
Africa.
The final argument is the moral argument.
The fact is that the return on companies in
vesting in South Africa is definitely en
hanced by the fact that the black population
is virtual slave labor.

solution, "substantial consensus exists in
the community on the undesirability of the
acts or effects in question." By voting to abs
tain on all the shareholder resolutions cal
ling for non-expansion or withdrawal of
American companies from South Africa, the
trustees apparently decided consensus in
support of the resolutions did not exist here.
Like their conclusion on the first criteria, we
must here again seriously question the trus
tees' judgment.
Proxy votes for shareholder resolutions
are processed by an elaborate system. First
an advisory committee makes recommenda
tions to Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance. Augsburger in turn
makes recommendations to the trustees. The
trustees then make the actual decision.
The inadequacy of this system in deter
mining any of the three criteria, but espe
cially the one calling for a consensus, can be
seen in the case of the J.P. Stevens sharehol
der resolution that came up last quarter. De
spite the advisory committee's recommen
dation that the University vote yes on the
resolution, and the demonstration through

petitions of widespread community support
for the resolution, the University decided to
abstain.
Failing to get recognition of community
consensus through all th legitimate channels
set up, a number of protesters staged a sit-in
in Augsburger office. Though the University
failed to change its vote on the J.P. Stevens
resolution, it did grant one of the demands of
those sitting in: to hold a forum on corporate
responsibility.
The major issue before that forum, held
two weeks ago, is the issue still before us:
how is the University going to vote on the
shareholder resolutions concerning South
Africa?
The University would like us to believe
that abstaining on the proxy votes—instead
of actually voting against them—and writing
"letters of concern" will ultimately do the
most good for South African blacks by mak
ing American companies more "progres
sive" in that country. However, abstaining
on a proxy is not a neutral act. Abstention
means that the abstainer agrees with the
majority—in these cases, that will be man
agement, since these resolutions have little
chance of passing at this point. The impact of
such a vote can only be to support the status
quo.
As for the"letters of concern," there is no
evidence that chiding letters have any effect
on multi-million dollar international con
glomerates like General Electric, Standard
Oil or General Motors.
Augsburger's letter to J.P. Stevens elicited
an arrogant reply basically calling him a
dupe of ignorant students.
So, the question remains: what is to be

done? The Stanford Coalition for Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP) is presently
circulating petitions calling for an affirma
tive vote on the resolutions.
Bing told us that the trustees would recon
sider the issue if we could show community
consensus in favor of the resolutions. We
urge you to sign this petition.
In summary, we would like to present
three distinct arguments for supporting this
petition, and further argue something that is
not advocated on the petition: if the resolu
tions fail to pass, the University divests itself
of the stock it holds in those companies.
The first, more moderate argument is that
the University's actions in themselves could
never force these companies to withdraw
from South Africa. Voting for these resolu
tions is just a way to get these corporations to
seriously re-examine their practices in South
Africa.
The second, probably the more far-sighted
argument recognizes that mere reform is no
longer possible or adequate in South Africa.
Events are moving too quickly. The white
minority rule in Rhodesia is collapsing.
In light of these trends, one should see the
University's vote for the resolutions—and
divestment if they fail—as the first major
step to end all foreign investment in South
Africa.
The final argument is the moral argument.
The fact is that the return on companies in
vesting in South Africa is definitely en
hanced by the fact that the black population
is virtual slave labor.

In yesterday's article, on the University's
investment policy, we dealt with the first of
the three criteria which are used to deter

shareholder resolutions. We demonstrated
how there can be no doubt that "the undesir
able acts or effect of the company are sub
stantial" when one is considering American
corporate presence in South Africa.
