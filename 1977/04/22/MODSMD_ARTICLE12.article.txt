# Mathe incident, proxy votes
## 
### 
Harmless hoax
I would like to respond to the
attacks which have been hurled
at ASSU Senator Jeff Stoler and
myself recently by the Daily in
connection with the "Recall
Mathe" incident.
My primary criticism is that
the Daily never printed our
reasons for our actions. Our goal
was to focus student attention on
the fact that ASSU Financial
Manager (Chris Mathe) had de
liberately disobeyed a Senate
by-law.
We wanted to make certain
that this would never happen
again. The by-law required
ASSU fee assessment refunds to
be made available in White
Plaza, instead of the ASSU of
fice. The intent of this by-law
was to make it easier for students
who wanted their money to get
it.
The Daily editorial said that
Mathe was correct in not hand
ing out money in White Plaza,
because there were not adequate
provisions for security.
Neither the Daily nor Mathe
ever considered alternative
means of carrying out the se
nate's intent. For example, on
Monday the senate adopted a
proposal of mine to give out
vouchers in White Plaza, which
could be redeemed in the ASSU
Office.
I'm certain that Mathe could
have come up with this idea, or a
similar one, if he had cared to
implement the senate's intent.
Furthermore, I stand by
Stoler's statement that he told
the Daily that we had "16 or 15"
signatures, and that the whole
plan arose when the Daily "mis
quoted him as saying '1615.' "
A brief look at the Daily indi
cates that it is not known for its
accuracy. First, the article on
Tuesday and editorial on Wed
nesday said that Stoler was
quoted as having "1650" signa
tures; the article which quoted
him, in the Daily of April 14,
said "1615."
Moreover, the editorial on
Wednesday which sought my
recall or censure didn't even get
my first name straight: I'm Jim

King, not Mike King.
Moreover, the Daily is guilty
as us of pulling a "hoax," be
cause of its gross negligence in
not checking out the truth of our
story.
A Daily reporter told me on
April 15 that she had had several
reports that our recall drive was
fictitious. A little investigation
would have revealed that very
few students had ever seen our
petitions.
We are sincerely apologetic
for any grief that we caused
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Mathe. I thought that he would
interpret our actions as a joke. I
mean, sending someone a
"threatening" note on the back
of a Chinese fortune cookie is not
very intimidating.
My point is that the Daily, by
not checking out the accuracy of
the story and by not printing the
evidence that it had been given,
was as guilty as us of perpetrat
ing the hoax.

No to abstention
The recent editorial (Daily,
April 20) endorsing the Board of
Trustees' abstentions on South
African proxy resolutions shows
not only a misunderstanding of
the importance of a "yes" proxy
vote, but an ignorance of the
facts of American presence in
South Africa.
University holdings as a per
cent of stock outstanding is an
irrelevant statistic when making
yes and no decisions. Whether
the University owned one or one
million shares of stock should
not affect its decisions to.support
human rights for South Africans.
Abstentions will not draw
more attention than a yes vote, as
the Daily asserts. First, absten
tions are not even registered as
shares being voted. Second, and
of crucial importiyice, if three
per cent of the shares voted are
voted yes, the resolutions will
automatically be included in a
company's resolutions for the
next year.
This would serve to keep
South African apartheid in the

public eye as well as maintain
ing pressure on American com
panies. Abstentions are not
counted toward this three per
cent goal. It should also be noted
that a letter to management, a
strategy favored by the Daily, is
in no way precluded by a yes
vote.
The Daily further posits that if
American companies do with
draw, groups "even less con
cerned with fighting apartheid"
might buy them out. The fact is
that the American business
community has made no efforts
to lobby for change within the
South African government.
And finally, by advocating
that the "Six Principles" be the
extent of U.S. reforms, the Daily
demonstrates a naive view of
conditions facing black South
Africans today. Even if all six re
forms could be implemented
(which they cannot under pre-

sent South African law), it
wouid still leave black South Af
ricans without the right to vote,
travel .freely, collectively bar
gain and many other basic
human rights.
Such superficial and simplis
tic reforms as the "Six Princi
ples" are hardly the way to "cor
rect" an ingrained and gov
ernmental ly supported system
of racism such as apartheid.
By abstaining, the board has
once again copped out on the
issue of South Africa. If instead
the trustees had shown moral
leadership and voted yes on the
proxies, they would truly have
been "exercising an influence in
behalf of humanity and civiliza
tion" as called for in the found
ing charter of the University.
