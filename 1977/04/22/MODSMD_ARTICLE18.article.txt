# In search of the ultimate pizza...
## 
### Harry Killas 
When only a pizza will do there's always Frankie, Johnny &
Luigi Too in Mountain View. But other places are closer. And
some of them rival Frankie's. Try Formico's if you can find it. Or
Jose's for a "Cuban" pizza. And Ramona's is worth a try, too.

When the food service blahs
strike or studies become too
tedious there are times when just
one thing will suffice — pizza.
And not the warm cardboard
prepared by the fast-food outlets
(or the grease and pepperoni
dished out at Stern Hall). It has to
he real pizza with, yes, a wheat
germ crust, gobs of mushrooms,
bountiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias .
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.
The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those
who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may he
jammed with five buddies into a

booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas —
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" — presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowi of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable
starter contains fresh carrots
and zucchini, cubes of ham and
beef and herbs. Fresh mus
hrooms ($1.50) sauteed in a wine
sauce and pungent with garlic
are always reliable for their juic
iness. Garlic bread (75 cents) is

another winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality — not only in
its pizzas — but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive
establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices (60
cents).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and con
tains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounded much
better than it tasted.
Ramon's pizzas are 10, 14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is possi
ble) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra

portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
was notable for its greaseless
ness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup oftheday, submarines, deli
sandwiches and hamburgers —
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beers and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss, it is because it tries to be
too many things to too many
people. Even so, the thoughtful
service, great atmosphere and
diverse menu make it a place to
visit often. Go early on weekends
to avoid the Stanford crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's. A year ago it changed
its name to Fiorello's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes inall Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brit
tle to sustain all items. A bit
more thickness would heighten
the pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their

pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make ever skeptic a devoted fan,
it is certainly worth trying.
(ose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but

less so with hum and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the
best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, u huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at HO cents. The house dres
sing combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but was applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups lrom Stan
ford sometimes entertain there
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here a
single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.
But what price convenience
and originality?
When only a pizza will do there's always Frankie, Johnny &

tains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounded much
better than it tasted.
Ramon's pizzas are 10, 14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is possi
ble) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra

portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
was notable for its greaseless
ness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup oftheday, submarines, deli
sandwiches and hamburgers —
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beers and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss, it is because it tries to be
too many things to too many
people. Even so, the thoughtful
service, great atmosphere and
diverse menu make it a place to
visit often. Go early on weekends
to avoid the Stanford crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's. A year ago it changed
its name to Fiorello's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes inall Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brit
tle to sustain all items. A bit
more thickness would heighten
the pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their

pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make ever skeptic a devoted fan,
it is certainly worth trying.
(ose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but

less so with hum and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the
best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, u huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at HO cents. The house dres
sing combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but was applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups lrom Stan
ford sometimes entertain there
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here a
single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.
But what price convenience
and originality?
When only a pizza will do there's always Frankie, Johnny &
Luigi Too in Mountain View. But other places are closer. And
some of them rival Frankie's. Try Formico's if you can find it. Or
Jose's for a "Cuban" pizza. And Ramona's is worth a try, too.

When the food service blahs
strike or studies become too
tedious there are times when just
one thing will suffice — pizza.
And not the warm cardboard
prepared by the fast-food outlets
(or the grease and pepperoni
dished out at Stern Hall). It has to
he real pizza with, yes, a wheat
germ crust, gobs of mushrooms,
bountiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias .
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.
The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those
who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may he
jammed with five buddies into a

booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas —
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" — presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowi of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable
starter contains fresh carrots
and zucchini, cubes of ham and
beef and herbs. Fresh mus
hrooms ($1.50) sauteed in a wine
sauce and pungent with garlic
are always reliable for their juic
iness. Garlic bread (75 cents) is

another winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality — not only in
its pizzas — but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive
establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices (60
cents).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and con
tains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounded much

(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, u huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at HO cents. The house dres
sing combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but was applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups lrom Stan
ford sometimes entertain there
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here a
single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.
But what price convenience
and originality?
When only a pizza will do there's always Frankie, Johnny &
Luigi Too in Mountain View. But other places are closer. And
some of them rival Frankie's. Try Formico's if you can find it. Or
Jose's for a "Cuban" pizza. And Ramona's is worth a try, too.

When the food service blahs
strike or studies become too
tedious there are times when just
one thing will suffice — pizza.
And not the warm cardboard
prepared by the fast-food outlets
(or the grease and pepperoni
dished out at Stern Hall). It has to
he real pizza with, yes, a wheat
germ crust, gobs of mushrooms,
bountiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias .
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.
The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those
who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may he
jammed with five buddies into a

booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas —
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" — presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowi of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable
starter contains fresh carrots
and zucchini, cubes of ham and
beef and herbs. Fresh mus
hrooms ($1.50) sauteed in a wine
sauce and pungent with garlic
are always reliable for their juic
iness. Garlic bread (75 cents) is

another winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality — not only in
its pizzas — but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive
establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices (60
cents).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and con
tains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounded much
better than it tasted.
Ramon's pizzas are 10, 14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is possi
ble) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra

portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
was notable for its greaseless
ness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup oftheday, submarines, deli
sandwiches and hamburgers —
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beers and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss, it is because it tries to be
too many things to too many
people. Even so, the thoughtful
service, great atmosphere and
diverse menu make it a place to
visit often. Go early on weekends
to avoid the Stanford crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's. A year ago it changed
its name to Fiorello's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes inall Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brit
tle to sustain all items. A bit
more thickness would heighten
the pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their

pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make ever skeptic a devoted fan,
it is certainly worth trying.
(ose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but

less so with hum and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the
best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, u huge plate of

woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices (60
cents).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and con
tains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounded much
better than it tasted.
Ramon's pizzas are 10, 14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is possi
ble) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra

portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
was notable for its greaseless
ness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup oftheday, submarines, deli
sandwiches and hamburgers —
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beers and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss, it is because it tries to be
too many things to too many
people. Even so, the thoughtful
service, great atmosphere and
diverse menu make it a place to
visit often. Go early on weekends
to avoid the Stanford crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's. A year ago it changed
its name to Fiorello's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes inall Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brit
tle to sustain all items. A bit
more thickness would heighten
the pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their

pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make ever skeptic a devoted fan,
it is certainly worth trying.
(ose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but

less so with hum and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the
best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, u huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at HO cents. The house dres
sing combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but was applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups lrom Stan
ford sometimes entertain there
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here a
single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.
But what price convenience
and originality?
When only a pizza will do there's always Frankie, Johnny &
Luigi Too in Mountain View. But other places are closer. And
some of them rival Frankie's. Try Formico's if you can find it. Or
Jose's for a "Cuban" pizza. And Ramona's is worth a try, too.

When the food service blahs
strike or studies become too
tedious there are times when just
one thing will suffice — pizza.
And not the warm cardboard
prepared by the fast-food outlets
(or the grease and pepperoni
dished out at Stern Hall). It has to
he real pizza with, yes, a wheat
germ crust, gobs of mushrooms,
bountiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias .
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.
The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those
who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may he
jammed with five buddies into a

booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas —
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" — presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowi of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable
starter contains fresh carrots
and zucchini, cubes of ham and
beef and herbs. Fresh mus
hrooms ($1.50) sauteed in a wine
sauce and pungent with garlic
are always reliable for their juic
iness. Garlic bread (75 cents) is

another winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality — not only in
its pizzas — but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive
establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
