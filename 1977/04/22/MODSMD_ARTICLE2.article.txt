# Take cue from Julian Bond
## Students to start NAACP chapter 
### Mark Funk 
Two students have begun a drive to
establish a chapter of a nationally
recognized civil rights organization
here.
Diane Burbie and Annette Murrell,
both freshmen, have been given the
go-ahead by officials of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) to form a
Stanford chapter.
Burbie initiated contact with the
NAACP last week and Murrell said she
hoped the new group might eventually
become the bulkhead for a permanent
minority coalition.
"We need this chapter so we can
give specific direction on political is
sues," Murrell said, noting that the
NAACP has attained national stature
and is still a potent political force.
"One'of the things 1 want this chapter
to do is educate people.
"My purpose is to make people
mad," Murrell said. "Anger gives way
to energy. Let's try to direct that energy
into issues like the Bakke case and
Niarobi schools (a private institution
in East Palo Alto). 1 am tired of other
people telling us what is going on in

South Africa or East Palo Alto which is
just over the bridge."
Meeting
A more immediate concern for Bur
bie and Murrell, however, are routine
organizational matters. For the
NAACP to officially recognize the
chapter, it needs to enroll a minimum
of 25 members. A meeting has been
called for 7 p.m. Monday in Ujamaa
large lounge and sign-up sheets have
been placed throughout the campus.
"We want to be organized for next
fall," Burbie said. Murrell added, "The
foundation has to be laid. We want to
get incoming freshmen involved next
year so we have to get established now
and define our goals."
Both Murrell and Burbie stressed
that the new chapter would not rival
other ethnic organizations on campus.
The original impetus to establish a
Stanford NAACP came from Julian
Bond when he spoke here April 11.
The Ceorgia legislator urged students
who wanted to get involved in the
civil rights movement to join the
NAACP. The organization, he said,
was the only one which still had con
siderable political clout.
Talk with Bond
"We talked with Bond after the
speech," Murrell said. "He embarras
sed me." She mentioned that the

NAACP had lost popularity among
younger blacks a'nd "Bond told me to
change my attitude toward the
NAACP."
The students are making a commit
ment to the NAACP at a transitional
point in its history. Under the gui
dance of longtime director Roy Wil
kens, it survived the Nixon years when
civil rights issues were placed on the
back burners and other minority or
ganizations faltered.
But Wilkens retired recently; he was
replaced by Benjamin Hooks, a former
Federal Communications Commis
sioner, after a drawn out internal
struggle among the group's leader
ship.
The NAACP also faces a possible fi
nancial crisis stemming from a series
of law suits in Mississippi.
St. ClairDrake, professor emeritus in
anthropology and sociology, said he
thought the establishment of an
NAACP chapter here "was a very heal
thy thing." He said the NAACP. has
always been an organization in which
"the college-trained segment of the
black community" — working with
"its white liberal friends" — could
promote change in the system.
'Vital part'
"The NAACP is a vital part of the
structure which has worked for the ex

tension of civil liberties," Drake said.
Drake, who helped found the youth
segment of the NAACP in the mid
-19305, said that he hoped there could
be "fruitful cooperation" between the
fledgling Stanford chapter and exist
ing branches in the mid-peninsula.
"I got tired of waiting for somebody
to come up and ask me to join some
thing," Murrell said. Burbie added,
'The only thing I am disappointed in
so far is that most of the people who
have signed up are black."

"My purpose is to make people
mad," Murrell said. "Anger gives way
to energy. Let's try to direct that energy
into issues like the Bakke case and
Niarobi schools (a private institution
in East Palo Alto). 1 am tired of other
people telling us what is going on in

South Africa or East Palo Alto which is
just over the bridge."
Meeting
A more immediate concern for Bur
bie and Murrell, however, are routine
organizational matters. For the
NAACP to officially recognize the
chapter, it needs to enroll a minimum
of 25 members. A meeting has been
called for 7 p.m. Monday in Ujamaa
large lounge and sign-up sheets have
been placed throughout the campus.
"We want to be organized for next
fall," Burbie said. Murrell added, "The
foundation has to be laid. We want to
get incoming freshmen involved next
year so we have to get established now
and define our goals."
Both Murrell and Burbie stressed
that the new chapter would not rival
other ethnic organizations on campus.
The original impetus to establish a
Stanford NAACP came from Julian
Bond when he spoke here April 11.
The Ceorgia legislator urged students
who wanted to get involved in the
civil rights movement to join the
NAACP. The organization, he said,
was the only one which still had con
siderable political clout.
Talk with Bond
"We talked with Bond after the
speech," Murrell said. "He embarras
sed me." She mentioned that the

NAACP had lost popularity among
younger blacks a'nd "Bond told me to
change my attitude toward the
NAACP."
The students are making a commit
ment to the NAACP at a transitional
point in its history. Under the gui
dance of longtime director Roy Wil
kens, it survived the Nixon years when
civil rights issues were placed on the
back burners and other minority or
ganizations faltered.
But Wilkens retired recently; he was
replaced by Benjamin Hooks, a former
Federal Communications Commis
sioner, after a drawn out internal
struggle among the group's leader
ship.
The NAACP also faces a possible fi
nancial crisis stemming from a series
of law suits in Mississippi.
St. ClairDrake, professor emeritus in
anthropology and sociology, said he
thought the establishment of an
NAACP chapter here "was a very heal
thy thing." He said the NAACP. has
always been an organization in which
"the college-trained segment of the
black community" — working with
"its white liberal friends" — could
promote change in the system.
'Vital part'
"The NAACP is a vital part of the
structure which has worked for the ex

tension of civil liberties," Drake said.
Drake, who helped found the youth
segment of the NAACP in the mid
-19305, said that he hoped there could
be "fruitful cooperation" between the
fledgling Stanford chapter and exist
ing branches in the mid-peninsula.
"I got tired of waiting for somebody
to come up and ask me to join some
thing," Murrell said. Burbie added,
'The only thing I am disappointed in
so far is that most of the people who
have signed up are black."
Two students have begun a drive to
establish a chapter of a nationally
recognized civil rights organization
here.
Diane Burbie and Annette Murrell,
both freshmen, have been given the
go-ahead by officials of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) to form a
Stanford chapter.
Burbie initiated contact with the
NAACP last week and Murrell said she
hoped the new group might eventually
become the bulkhead for a permanent
minority coalition.
"We need this chapter so we can
give specific direction on political is
sues," Murrell said, noting that the
NAACP has attained national stature
and is still a potent political force.
"One'of the things 1 want this chapter
to do is educate people.
"My purpose is to make people
