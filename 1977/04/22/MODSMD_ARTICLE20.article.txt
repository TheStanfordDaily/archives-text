# Pizza: Alpha Delts offer an alternative pie
## 
### Sue Rice 
Enterprising individuals at the Alpha Delt
house combine business and fun to bring hot
pizza to Stanford students three nights a week.
"It's an honest way to make a buck," said
Dave Woodard, co-manager of the Alpha Delt
pizza service. "It also serves as a vehicle for
exposing people to my house," adds Woodard,
hoping the operation will give the Alpha Delts
fraternity house a better image.
Woodard and co-manager Martin Slusser are
continuing the pizza tradition conceived by Jay
Farr, a former Alpha Delt and Stanford under
grad.
There are five people that make up the crew
every night, usually all members of the frater
nity. Each are paid $10 for their separate duties.
The five jobs include delivery via a motorcy
cle, making pizza doughs, garnishing theactual
pizza, cooking and manning the phones.
Party exchange
The Alpha Delta house gives the industrious
group liberty of the kitchen three nights a week.
In return, the operation gives the house por
tions of their profit, usually in the form of a
party.
"The operation is not really making good
money," Woodard said, but they haven't actu
ally determined the net profit so far. It has reco
vered from initial cost factors, like a warming
oven for the delivery motorcycle, which put the
service into the red.

The different pizzas range from a plain
cheese (V2 lb. of cheese is used) to an "every
thing" pizza, with the costs ranging from $3.50
to $4.50.
Curious greenery
One Stanford student called up and asked if
he could bring his own "greenery" to spice the
pizza up. Herbs, magical or otherwise, will be
cooked on request but must be supplied by the
individual, the student said.
The number of pizzas produced ranges from
30 to 60 per evening.
Because of Alpha Delts limited production,
the University is willing to approve the pizza
service. The University concern is that opera
tions like Alpha Delts don't have a negative
impact on Tresidder's business.
Tresidder monopoly
"We want to maintain a monopoly," stated
Dan Williams, associate dean of students and
director of TDS. The Tresidder food service
doesn't carry its full weight and must be in
sured needed money won't be taken away by
alternative student services, he added.
Even though the Italian house might start a
pizza delivery of their own next year, Woodard
doesn't fear competition.
"It won't make a big difference, in fact I take it
as a compliment that someone else wants to
copy us," he commented. Regardless of com
petition, business will be good because "on a
college campus there is usually an unlimited
supply of pizza eaters," Woodard added.
