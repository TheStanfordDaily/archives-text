I graduated from Stanford in
lune 1976, and am now a
graduate student here. I was
wondering if you could find out
where I can get a copy of the
1976 Froshhook, and possibly
the Class of '77 also? -C.Y.
The Stanford Quad office has
back issues of many Froshbooks,
and business manager Mamie
Shih says that both the class of
1976 and class of 1977 issues are
available. The cost of the 1976
Kroshbook is $2.50; the 1977 one
is $3.
The Quad office is located in
the Storke Publications Building
and is open Monday through
Friday from 2 to 4 p.m.
Can you ask the Palo Alto
Traffic Control Department or
the responsible government
agency to install a sensor at the
traffic lights at the corner of
Hansen Way and El Camino
Heal just south of Page Mill Road
near Kinney Shoe store?
Motorists who use El Camino
Real every day can testify that

those lights can really hinder the
flow of traffic at rush hours. I
frequently just sit on El Camino
Real at the Hansen Way traffic
lights because they turn red,
even though no cur ever comes
out of Hansen Way.
They can at least turn the
lights into blinker lights from 11
p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thank you for investigating
the matter. -M.C.
El Camino Real is completely
under state control, Palo Alto
has nothing to do with the traffic
signals. So, I called the Califor
nia State Traffic Engineer's Of
fice in San Francisco and talked
to Ed Wong, who is an associate
electrical engineer there.
He said that there are "sensors
on all approaches." So the signal
shouldn't behave the way you
describe unless, "one of the de
tectors isn't working."
State employes are out every
day checking the streets, but
they can't catch everything, so
Wong was glad you brought the

matter to his attention. "We will
definitely look into it,"he said.

Many thanks for the educa
tional information on the stack
on the roof of the Terman En
gineering Building. My question
is, "What color are they going to
paint the perchloric acid stack?
Red tile or the familiar stone
masonry?" -R.N.B.
Unfortunately, the stack is
made of stainless steel, so it
won't become a mini-Hoover
Tower bedecked with red tile.
But Gary Rotzin, assistant to the
manager of University construc
tion, says that the architect is
now in the process of designing
an enclosure.
This would "possibly be made
of redwood slat," and would
cover the machinery around the
bottom of the stack.
The stack itself however, will
still be visible. But that's okay.
After all, isn't redwood fairly
consistent with the "Stanford
Image?"

they can't catch everything, so
Wong was glad you brought the

matter to his attention. "We will
definitely look into it,"he said.

Many thanks for the educa
tional information on the stack
on the roof of the Terman En
gineering Building. My question
is, "What color are they going to
paint the perchloric acid stack?
Red tile or the familiar stone
masonry?" -R.N.B.
Unfortunately, the stack is
made of stainless steel, so it
won't become a mini-Hoover
Tower bedecked with red tile.
But Gary Rotzin, assistant to the
manager of University construc
tion, says that the architect is
now in the process of designing
an enclosure.
This would "possibly be made
of redwood slat," and would
cover the machinery around the
bottom of the stack.
The stack itself however, will
still be visible. But that's okay.
After all, isn't redwood fairly
consistent with the "Stanford
Image?"

I graduated from Stanford in
lune 1976, and am now a
graduate student here. I was
wondering if you could find out
where I can get a copy of the
1976 Froshhook, and possibly
the Class of '77 also? -C.Y.
The Stanford Quad office has
back issues of many Froshbooks,
and business manager Mamie
Shih says that both the class of
1976 and class of 1977 issues are
available. The cost of the 1976
Kroshbook is $2.50; the 1977 one
is $3.
The Quad office is located in
the Storke Publications Building
and is open Monday through
Friday from 2 to 4 p.m.
Can you ask the Palo Alto
Traffic Control Department or
the responsible government
agency to install a sensor at the
traffic lights at the corner of
Hansen Way and El Camino
Heal just south of Page Mill Road
near Kinney Shoe store?
Motorists who use El Camino
Real every day can testify that

those lights can really hinder the
flow of traffic at rush hours. I
frequently just sit on El Camino
Real at the Hansen Way traffic
lights because they turn red,
even though no cur ever comes
out of Hansen Way.
They can at least turn the
lights into blinker lights from 11
p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thank you for investigating
the matter. -M.C.
El Camino Real is completely
under state control, Palo Alto
has nothing to do with the traffic
signals. So, I called the Califor
nia State Traffic Engineer's Of
fice in San Francisco and talked
to Ed Wong, who is an associate
electrical engineer there.
He said that there are "sensors
on all approaches." So the signal
shouldn't behave the way you
describe unless, "one of the de
tectors isn't working."
State employes are out every
day checking the streets, but
they can't catch everything, so
Wong was glad you brought the

matter to his attention. "We will
definitely look into it,"he said.
