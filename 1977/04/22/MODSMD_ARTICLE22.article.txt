# Paolo Soleri builds a dream
## 
### Frances Draper 
An overt lowing crowd
gathered in Kresge Auditorium
to hear Italian-born architect
Paolo Soleri speak about Ar
cosanti, his ecologically
oriented, model town of the fu
ture now under construction in
central Arizona, 70 miles north
of Phoenix.
Soleri s Wednesday speech be
came somewhat confusing when
he began to explain his belief in
the spiritual evolution of man
kind to the final state of nirvana.
It was unclear just how his urban
models for towns of 3000 people
up to towns for one million fit
into this spiritual evolution of
mankind.
Soleri seems to believe that his
ecological urban models will
cure society of pollution, energy
waste, segregation, opulence
and greed, creating an "ecologi
cal and psychological sanity."
When asked how he expected
so many people to live in such a
highly condensed area, har
moniously working and grow
ing together, Soleri repliedinex
tremely vague and general
terms, without meeting theques
tion head-on.
Old problem
"Mankind has been working
on this problem for thousands of
years," he said, and, after all,

Something "bugging you?"

"crowding is life."
Arcosanti is being built as a
prototype and testing ground for
Soleri's concept of arcology —
the fusion of architecture and
ecology. The main goal of arcol
ogy is to effectively deal with
urban problems of energy, pollu
tion, transportation and land
consumption.
Since construction of Ar
cosanti began in 1970, morethan
2500 students and professionals
have taken part in the project. It
is planned to be 25 stories high,
covering 10 acres.
One of the dominant features
of Arcosanti will be the absence
of automobiles and therefore, the
absence of highways, garages,
parking lots and gas stations.
Extensive use of greenhouses
will be made both for food pro
duction and as solar energy col
lectors from which the energy
will be redirected to meet the
heating and cooling needs of the
community.
Pay to work
Soleri is trying to attract stu
dents to attend a four-day semi
nar and then work in the project
for six-week periods. The stu
dents pay him $510 to work. He
admitted this policy only allows
affluent students to take part in
the project, but argued that the
project is consumer-oriented
and consumers are the affluent
class.
The Arcosanti complex pre
sently consists of residences,
drafting studios, metal, wood
and electrical workshops, a
ceramics facility and foundry, a
four-story living, restaurant and
exhibition complex (near com

pletion) and a 25-meter solar
heated swimming pool (under
construction). The project has
been recognized as an official
bicentennial site, both by the
state and the nation.
Soleri worked with Frank
Lloyd Wright for V/z years in the

1940s and came from Italy to live
in the United States in 1955.
Soleri founded the Cosanti
Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
in 1956.. It is the organization
through which Soleri carries out
his philosophical education and
construction work.

"crowding is life."
Arcosanti is being built as a
prototype and testing ground for
Soleri's concept of arcology —
the fusion of architecture and
ecology. The main goal of arcol
ogy is to effectively deal with
urban problems of energy, pollu
tion, transportation and land
consumption.
Since construction of Ar
cosanti began in 1970, morethan
2500 students and professionals
have taken part in the project. It
is planned to be 25 stories high,
covering 10 acres.
One of the dominant features
of Arcosanti will be the absence
of automobiles and therefore, the
absence of highways, garages,
parking lots and gas stations.
Extensive use of greenhouses
will be made both for food pro
duction and as solar energy col
lectors from which the energy
will be redirected to meet the
heating and cooling needs of the
community.
Pay to work
Soleri is trying to attract stu
dents to attend a four-day semi
nar and then work in the project
for six-week periods. The stu
dents pay him $510 to work. He
admitted this policy only allows
affluent students to take part in
the project, but argued that the
project is consumer-oriented
and consumers are the affluent
class.
The Arcosanti complex pre
sently consists of residences,
drafting studios, metal, wood
and electrical workshops, a
ceramics facility and foundry, a
four-story living, restaurant and
exhibition complex (near com

pletion) and a 25-meter solar
heated swimming pool (under
construction). The project has
been recognized as an official
bicentennial site, both by the
state and the nation.
Soleri worked with Frank
Lloyd Wright for V/z years in the

1940s and came from Italy to live
in the United States in 1955.
Soleri founded the Cosanti
Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
in 1956.. It is the organization
through which Soleri carries out
his philosophical education and
construction work.
An overt lowing crowd
gathered in Kresge Auditorium
to hear Italian-born architect
Paolo Soleri speak about Ar
cosanti, his ecologically
oriented, model town of the fu
ture now under construction in
central Arizona, 70 miles north
of Phoenix.
Soleri s Wednesday speech be
came somewhat confusing when
he began to explain his belief in
the spiritual evolution of man
kind to the final state of nirvana.
It was unclear just how his urban
models for towns of 3000 people
up to towns for one million fit
into this spiritual evolution of
mankind.
Soleri seems to believe that his
ecological urban models will
cure society of pollution, energy
waste, segregation, opulence
and greed, creating an "ecologi
cal and psychological sanity."
When asked how he expected
so many people to live in such a
highly condensed area, har
moniously working and grow
