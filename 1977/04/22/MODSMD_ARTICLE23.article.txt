## 
### Kath Scanlon 
Four law students will be tak
ing their cases all the way to the
"Supreme Court" Friday at the
finals of the 1977 Moot Court
Competition, tobe held at 3:15 in
Kresge.
"It's set up just as if these stu
dents were arguing before the
Supreme Court," said Rick
Alber, vice president of the Stan
ford Law School Moot Court
Board. The contestants choose to
argue either prosecution or de
fense in a hypothetical case.
This year's case involves the
legality of the ban on attorney
advertising. "Two lawyers put
an ad in the paper advertising
that they are lawyers, give good
service, etc. — that is, they sol
icit business," explained Alber.
"Advertising is illegal under
current codes of professional re
sponsibility. They go through
disciplinary proceedings in
their state — we put them in a
hypothetical state — they are
disbarred, and they appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court."

The attorneys are attacking t he
provisions prohibiting advertis
ing on the grounds that the rules
violate either the First Amend
ment or the Sherman Antitrust
Act.
TheHonorable David Bazelon,
Chief Judge for the Court of Ap
peals of the District of Columbia
circuit; the Honorable Leon Hig
ginbotham, District Judge in the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania;
and the Honorable Stanley
Mosk, Associate Justice of the
California Supreme Court will
act as the U.S. Supreme Court
and judge the competition. "We
wrote and asked (them to
come)," said Alber. "They come
at our expense."
"Any law student who wanted
to (could enter)," according to
Alber. "Initially there was a
pretty small turnout, but we've
had semifinals and we've pared
it down to four people." These
four are Jack Bogdanski, Dave
Fairweather and Dave Hayes, all
second year law students, and
Bob Percival, third year.
