# Stewart Meacham at l-Center
## Vietnam's rebuilding continues 
### Greg Vandenberg 
"The Vietnamese are going to make it,
there's just no doubt about it." In a confident
tone, a recent American visitor to the
Socialist Republic of Vietnam described
conditions in the country forged from North
and South Vietnams.
Stewart Meacham, a member of the
American Friends Service Committee
(AFSC) delegation, detailed at Bechtel Inter
national Center on Wednesday his 18 day
motorcade tour from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh
City (Saigon) which ended in mid-February.
He and five other members of the AFSC, a
peace organization long opposed to the
American war efforts in Southeast Asia, ex
perienced an uplift upon their return to Vie
tnam he said, since many of them last saw
the country amid the ravages of the late six
ties.
Now the Vietnamese have peacefully un
ited the country and the sensation that they
will rebuild their economy "comes through
very strongly," according to Meacham.
Resettlement
Rural resettlement of the farmlands re
mains the primary and most difficult task for
the Vietnamese. Meacham claimed that the
American solution to a Vietnamese victory
in the sixties and early seventies was mass
urbanization of the populace. The displace
ment of people to the cities was to have iso
lated the southerners from northern influ
ences. In the meantime, productive farmland
became battlegrounds and the South Viet
namese had to import most of their food.
Meacham reported signs of progress all
along their north-south route. Dikes, de
stroyed during the war, have been rebuilt
thereby halting tidewater intrusion upon
previously fertile lands.
Yet, with its limited resources, the gov

ernment is only gradually developing outly
ing areas. Unemployed families from the
cities, primarily members of the displaced
farming communities of the sixties, are settl
ing into "new economic zones," he said.
Still active mines
Problems have arisen, however. Land
mines and personnel bombs still abound in
most of these zones and many farmers un
knowingly detonate the explosives. As a
consequence, Meacham said, many oxen
have been killed leaving the farmers them
selves to pull the plows.
Outside observers, including Meacham,
believe that the farmlands will be rehabili
tated sooner than expected, probably within
10 years. Defoliated land, areas treated dur
ing the war to prevent plant growth and
eliminate enemy cover, is expected to start
regenerating sooner than previously fore
seen.
Changes abound in the cities as well,
Meacham said. Children that begged on the
streets of Saigon during the war to survive
now have a place in orphanages so "they can
(eventually) make a positive contribution to
it (society)." A hospital in the town ofQuang
Ngai, located in the northern area of South
Vietnam, has greatly improved since his last
visit there in the late sixties. Meacham said
he sensed greater expertise and organization
among the medical staff.
Addressing the issue of retribution of
South Vietnamese army officers, he said that
non-commissioned officers, having received
a three day "re-education" course at the end
of the war, are now normal citizens. On the
other hand, approximately 50,000 higher
ranking officers are still in re-education cen
ters.
With regard to foreign relations, many

high level Vietnamese officials foresee
"terms of friendship with the United States
despite the record of the past." They qualify
this view believing that there is a difference
"between American Imperialists, aggressors
and the American people," Meacham said.
The Vietnamese hope for relations is tem
pered with the expectation of "substantial
assistance from the U. 5.," he said.
Government leaders in Hanoi also in
formed the AFSC delegation that American
businesses, particularly oil companies, hope
to invest in the two year old socialist coun
try. Meacham said that trade policy, as of yet
unformulated, is forthcoming. The expected
ground rules will stipulate considerable Vie
tnamese control of foreign-owned opera
tions, he said.
Human rights
In response to a question concerning
human rights in Vietnam, Meacham detailed
a visit to a Catholic service in Hanoi. He
stated that such rights of the people have
"not (been) trampled underfoot."
The AFSC delegates also witnessed the
dedication of a wood screw factory in Hanoi.
The AFSC had supplied the materials and
machinery for the plant as part of its effort to
help rebuild the country.
Meacham, active with the AFSC since
1957, most recently served for five years as
director of the Quaker International Affairs
Seminars program in Singapore with his
wife. That program served as a means of dis
cussing pertinent issues of community or
ganization, paramedical training and social
development projects in Thailand, In
donesia and the Philippines.
The address, sp6nsored by the Volunteers
in Asia (VIA) and Bechtel International
Center, is part of a three month speaking tour
for Meacham.
