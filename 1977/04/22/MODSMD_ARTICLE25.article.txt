## campus theater/marc zasada Production key in Ram's Head's 'Fiddler' 
### 
The serio-comic musical goes
back to the days of Mozart opera
and seems proven with time to
be among the most enchanting of
musical species. Fiddler on the
Hoof, perhaps the most success
ful modern venture in this genre,
is to the producer an all but no
risk proposition. I have never yet
seen it entirely fail to work its
peculiar magic on an audience.
Ram's Head, led by director
Paul Edwards, producer Douglas
Bedard, and choreographer Ann
Mai muth-Onn has put together a
production which should not be
missed by even the most jaded of
Fiddler fans.
Fiddler has been called a
one-man show — and with jus
tification — for though we see
the humor and tragedy of the vil
lage Anatevka, the drama is fo
cused on Tevye, the dairyman
whose strength of character; ir
repressible gaiety, and sheer
Jewishness dominate the story
from beginning to end. Not true
of the Ram's Head presentation,

where the color, the music, the
life of the village overwhelm
Tevye's personal drama with
somewhat unfortunate results.
Gruff humor
Kevin Cavanaugh brings to the
part of Tevye the proper gruff
ness of manner, the proper
humor, even the proper (if unde
finable) Jewishness — as well as
an absolutely superior singing
voice — and yet somehow fails
to establish the kind of stage pre
sence so necessary to the part.
His interpretation emphasizes
perhaps a bit too much the
oafishness of Tevye, the clumsi
ness of the man in dealing with
the world. His Tevye is too much
the "wise fool" of serio
comedy. Often, it seems strained
and artificial when he affects the
growling bass of Zero Mostel in
asking "Why me?" of God.
Enough said. Many, many
times Cavanaugh, with some
superb direction by Edwards,
manages to evoke the magic of
Fiddler, and throughout he is

supported by a cast which fairly
radiates energy and joy.
The real highlights of the
show, however, are the fresh and
ebullient choreography of Ms.
Malmuth-Onn, the adroit pro
duction of Douglas Bedard, and
the villagers of Anatevka. Each
production number is wonder
fully intricate, colorful, and
musically excellent. The sets
(designed by Roy Holliday, Katie
Solow, and Michael Ellis) spin
and descend with dazzling effi
ciency, and always convince de
lightfully through abstraction.
Superior song
The singing throughout is
well above college-musical qual
ity, and music director Sam
Spigelman keeps an exceptional
and spirited chorus in fine ba
lance with the vocally strong
principals and a spirited or
chestra. The dancers, too
numerous to list, execute amaz
ing and originally choreog
raphed "bottle" and "Russian"
dances, and the crowd dancing

throughout is not only spectacu
larly machinated, but convinc
ingly semetic.
And now at last we come to the
principals. Liza kinsell is superb
in the part of Golde, Tevye's
strong, quarrelsome, and long
suffering wife. Her voice is one
of the best in the cast, and she
plays the part with just the right
mixture of stereotypical
Jewish-mother-shrewish ness
and human sympathy.
Nancy Jamison, as Tevye's el
dest of five daughters, is evenly
professional in portraying
Tzeitel's delicacy of manner and
strength of character. An actress!
Her opposite, Clark Sterling in
the part of the tailor Motel, is at
times just a bit too weak and ef
feminate, but redeems himself
nicely with his well-sung
"Miracle of Miracles."
Mary Setrakian gives us a con
vincing and evenly sympathetic
Hodel, and her "Far from the
Home I Love" succeeds admira
bly. Robert Human, as her radi
cal lover, Perchik, is strong, like
able, and credible — as well as
supplying a voice which really
shines in his "Now I Have Every
thing."
High level drama
Beth Turner, as the disinher
ited third daughter, Chava, fairly
sparkles in "Matchmaker," and
keeps up a high level of drama
until the end. Stephen Pascal
gives the cleanest-cut and least
mysterious Fyedka (Chava's
Russian lover) I have seen, and
though he is a bit stiff at the start,
he soon warms to the part, and
plays off Chava smoothly.
Susan Nicol plays the match
maker Yente with the approp
riate blend of biddying and
hammed comedy. Wayne Peate,

as the russian constable, is a bit
too evil and unctuous to be as
sympathetic as the author
meant, but is on the whole ac
ceptable.
David Parker does not make as
much as he might have out of the
part of Lazar Wolf, the disap
pointed butcher, but is enjoyable
nonetheless. Jeff Terry injects a
lot of interest into his tiny role of
the beggar. Susan Spinrad and
Donna Robinson are approp
riately underfoot as the youngest
of Tevye's daughters.
Much was made in the prog
ram notes of the verissimo aimed
for in the Ram's Head produc
tion. The producers researched,
lectured, and tried always to ap
proximate the culture, dress,
mannerisms — the spirit of
turn-of-the-century Russian
Jewry.
Not having been there, I can
not evaluate the success of these
attempts. But I can say that they
have given the cast the so neces
sary spirit of "joy in the face of
suffering," and breathed in the
rich liveliness which is the es
sence of Fiddler on the Roof.
The play continues tonight
and tomorrow night at Mem
Aud. Curtain is at 8.
