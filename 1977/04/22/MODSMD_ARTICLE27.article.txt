## Mingus carries on legend 
### 
Charles Mingus' one night
stand in San Francisco's Creat
American Music Hall Monday
night proved that after 40 years,
he is still one of the foremost
bass players and composers on
the jazz scene.
The people with whom Min
gus has played in his career read
like a Who's Who of jazz greats.
Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker,
Dizzie Gillespie and Max Roach
are just a few of the jazz masters
with whom Mingus has been as
sociated.
Mingus' connection with
Duke Ellington, for example, has
had a profound influence on his
compositions over the years.
Most Mingus compositions are
parts of old jazz classics which
lie has synthesized into intricate,
highly complex pieces. The bas
sist works with the time signa
ture and the melody of the old
classics to produce a unique and
entertaining sound.
So it was no wonder that the
two sets consisted entirely of
tunes written by Mingus.
The first tune, "Remember
Rockefeller to Attica" gave the
audience a taste of the deftly
moving hands of Mingus as well
as the strong back-up and solo
ability of his four-piece band.

On drums, Dannie Richmond
provided the backbone for the
changing rhythms, while Ricky
Ford (tenor saxaphone) and Jack
Walrath (trumpet) played syn
copated duets with ease and Bob
Nelams rounded out the sound
on piano.
Always the showman, Mingus
stopped playing when it was his
turn to solo in the first song. In
stead of playing, he put his
elbow on the piano and started to
talk to the piano player. The
music stopped altogether as
Mingus chatted with the musi
cians. Finally, closing his eyes,
he launched the band back into
the song, finishing it with the
long-awaited solo.
By doing the unexpected,
Mingus teases the audience and
gets them to listen that much
more. In a song entitled "Shades
of Blue" he played an extended

solo, slipping in the melody of
"When Johnny Comes Marching
Home," to the delight of the full
house.
Between songs Mingus was as
quick with his wit as he was with
his bass playing. Dressed in
black, the stout Mingus looked
like the king and the court jester
rolled into one.
His last two songs were from
his latest album entitled
Changes. The songs featured
solos by Richmond and Ford.
After a standing ovation, Min
gus played a duet with
Richmond on vocals singing, "If
You Could See Me Now."
"If you'd like to hear some
more, we are going on a plane to
New Orleans tomorrow," Min
gus said.
"Why don't you all come
along."
I'd like to take him up on that.

Ford (tenor saxaphone) and Jack
Walrath (trumpet) played syn
copated duets with ease and Bob
Nelams rounded out the sound
on piano.
Always the showman, Mingus
stopped playing when it was his
turn to solo in the first song. In
stead of playing, he put his
elbow on the piano and started to
talk to the piano player. The
music stopped altogether as
Mingus chatted with the musi
cians. Finally, closing his eyes,
he launched the band back into
the song, finishing it with the
long-awaited solo.
By doing the unexpected,
Mingus teases the audience and
gets them to listen that much
more. In a song entitled "Shades
of Blue" he played an extended

solo, slipping in the melody of
"When Johnny Comes Marching
Home," to the delight of the full
house.
Between songs Mingus was as
quick with his wit as he was with
his bass playing. Dressed in
black, the stout Mingus looked
like the king and the court jester
rolled into one.
His last two songs were from
his latest album entitled
Changes. The songs featured
solos by Richmond and Ford.
After a standing ovation, Min
gus played a duet with
Richmond on vocals singing, "If
You Could See Me Now."
"If you'd like to hear some
more, we are going on a plane to
New Orleans tomorrow," Min
gus said.
"Why don't you all come
along."
I'd like to take him up on that.
Charles Mingus' one night
stand in San Francisco's Creat
American Music Hall Monday
night proved that after 40 years,
he is still one of the foremost
bass players and composers on
the jazz scene.
The people with whom Min
gus has played in his career read
like a Who's Who of jazz greats.
Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker,
Dizzie Gillespie and Max Roach
are just a few of the jazz masters
with whom Mingus has been as
sociated.
Mingus' connection with
Duke Ellington, for example, has
had a profound influence on his
compositions over the years.
Most Mingus compositions are
parts of old jazz classics which
lie has synthesized into intricate,
highly complex pieces. The bas
sist works with the time signa
ture and the melody of the old
classics to produce a unique and
entertaining sound.
So it was no wonder that the
two sets consisted entirely of
tunes written by Mingus.
The first tune, "Remember
Rockefeller to Attica" gave the
audience a taste of the deftly
moving hands of Mingus as well
as the strong back-up and solo
ability of his four-piece band.

On drums, Dannie Richmond
provided the backbone for the
changing rhythms, while Ricky
Ford (tenor saxaphone) and Jack
Walrath (trumpet) played syn
copated duets with ease and Bob
Nelams rounded out the sound
on piano.
