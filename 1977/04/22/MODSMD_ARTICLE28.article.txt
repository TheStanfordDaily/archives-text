# Modern Quartet in Oakland
## 
### 
Jazz, like other art forms, is labeled by move
ments. Following the big-band days was the bebop
movement, started by Charlie Parker and Dizzy
Gillespie. Then, after a transition period of hard
bop, came "cool" jazz in the early '50s. Two artists
are associated with "cool" jazz: Miles Davis and
John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet, who will
perform at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland next
Monday at 8 p.m.
Lewis organized the MJQ in 1952. It was a time
for small combos. The music is soft, unassuming
and structured: essentially, everything that bebop

wasn't. Lewis, the pianist, draws from classical
romanticism in his compositions. The MJQ is not
without its blues, though, and they play them with
driving swing.
Lewis formed the MJQ with Milt Jackson who
plays vibes. They were both previously with Gil
lespie. Bassist Percy Heath and Drummer Connie
Kay comprise the rest of the quartet. In 1957. the
MJQbecame the first jazz group to play in a serious
concert hall in Germany. The Congress Hall in
West Berlin was host.
