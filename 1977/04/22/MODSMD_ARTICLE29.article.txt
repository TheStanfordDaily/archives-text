## Hot hitting Hinojosa Compact Card packs big wallop 
### Cathy Dickerson 
At 5-foot-7, 160 pounds, the
Cardinal's compact leadoff bat
ter steps up to the plate and laces
another line drive for a base hit.
He's junior Pepe Hinojosa, Stan
ford's hot-hitting leftfielder who
currently leads the team with an
impressive .385 league batting
average.
"Being a smaller batter I've
learned to hit the ball to all
fields," remarks Hinojosa. "This
gives me a real advantage at bat
since the defense has a hard time
setting up against me. By scatter
ing my hits throughout the field,
I can't be played as a strict pull
hitter or whatever, and so I get on
more often."
Slow start
Pepe got off to a slow start this
year due to cracking t he knuckle
of his little finger on his right
hand three weeks into the sea
son. Teammate Randy Wong
took Hinojosa's spot in the
lineup for a couple of weeks
while he was out and hit the ball
well in place of Hinojosa.
While his knuckle was in
jured, Pepe had to change his

grip slightly. But as soon as the
finger healed, he resumed his
old grip and worked his way
back into the lineup.
"Nothing really changed; not
my stance or swing or anything.
I'm doing pretty much the same
thing now as I did before I got
injured."
Hinojosa's current hot streak
included two 4-for-5 games in
the San Jose State Spartan Clas
sic Baseball Tournament. The
junior from Sunnyvale collected
all three tournament honors —
the Charlie Hustle Award, MVP
and the top batter award — while
leading the Cards to the tourney
championship.
He hasn't stopped hitting the
ball.
"I guess it's just one of those
hot streaks that batters have,"
Pepe admits modestly, "it's not
like I'm hitting the ball solidly
all the time. Sometimes I hit the
ball hard and sometimes it just
drops in for a base hit. I'd have to
say my success has been a com
bination of luck and being 100
per cent healthy again."
Having Pepe back on the roster

helped the club in the last couple
of games. Besides his threaten
ing bat, he also has three of the
team's league RBIs. One of the
Card's biggest problems this sea
son has been leaving men
stranded.
"My function as lead-off batter
is just to get on base," states
Hinojosa. "If I get a hit with a
man on — an RBI — it helps, but
I'm not relied on to do that.
When I come up to bat, I don't
think of bringing the runners
home; I just try to make contact."
Looking forward to this com
ing weekend, Pepe hopes to keep
hitting against the league lead
ers — use.
"Coach Marquess stresses in
tensity for all our games," com
ments Hinojosa, "but beating SC
means something special to all
of us. We've got a certain feeling,
a desire to beat them."
Stanford meets the Trojans in
a three-game home stand this
weekend starting today at Sun
ken Diamond. Today the two
teams play at 2:30 p.m. and then
on Saturday and Sunday they

meet for single games starting at
1 p.m.
Career aspirations
As far as Pepe's career plans
go, he hasn't ruled out baseball,
but he says he won't be disap
pointed if he doesn't get into the
major leagues.
"Being realistic, I'm thinking
more toward my industrial en
gineering major for my future
but I hate to put baseball out of
my mind."
This summer he's hoping to
get a job in the industrial en
gineering field, but if he can't,
he'll stay in the area and most
likely play on one of the local
teams. Either way, he'll defi
nitely be back at Stanford next
year.
