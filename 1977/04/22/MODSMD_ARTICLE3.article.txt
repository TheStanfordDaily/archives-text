# Friends, staff rally to protest firing of cook
## 
### 
About 30 students and staff mem
bers held a noon rally outside Encina
Hall yesterday to protest the firing of
Branner cook Lindsey Taylor.
After brief speeches by Jim Berk,
former USE president, and Taylor, the
group marched to Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert Au
gsberger's office and presented Dan
DeYoung, director of service opera
tions, with a batch of petitions asking
that Taylor be rehired.
DeYoung received the petitions, but
refused to respond to questions from
the group, saying that he would not
discuss the case because "it is under
arbitration."
Taylor said he was fired from his job
March 10 for insubordination but
"they (the food service management)
never did give me a definite reason."
He said that the conflict which led to
his firing started in September when
Janice Marks became the Branner food
service manager.
At the rally, Taylor claimed that
Marks made him follow recipes pre
cisely and did not allow him any lee
way in preparing food. He said that in
previous years, he was given some dis
cretion in following the recipes.
Marks refused to comment.
Berk said at the rally that Taylor was
"not a hot shot organizer" for the
union but was only "concerned about
doing his job well." He claimed that
Taylor's dismissal was "not necessary
and not required."
Berk added that "this is a very im
portant case in the food service" and
said that the workers in the food ser
vice "have been kowtowing for too
long."
A large number of students were in
the group that presented the petitions
to DeYoung. One ex-Branner resident
said Taylor was popular with the stu
dents when he lived in the dorm. The
student said there was "little question
of who is right in the eyes of the stu
dents."
