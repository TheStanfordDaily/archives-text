# DiBiaso signs cage star
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Basketball coach Dick Dißiaso
announced yesterday that Mark
Pitchford, a two-time All-
Washington D.C. eager, has
signed a national letter of intent
to attend Stanford. Earlier in the
week Dißiaso announced the
signing of two other prep bas
ketball stars, 6-foot-l Peter Lal
las from Eugene, Ore., and 6-7
Jeff Ryan from Winnetka, 111.
The 6-4 Pitchford averaged
19.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and
four assists per game while lead
ing St. John's Military Academy
to a 27-4 record and the
Washington D.C. city champ
ionship.
Later this spring, Pitchford
will play for the Washington
D.C. All-Star team against the
visiting Russian Junior All-
Stars.
Pitchford's team was also
ranked 10th nationally by Bas
ketball Weekly and first among
the nation's Catholic schools.
Clutch player
"Mark is a great prospect,"
Dißiaso said. "He's really
proven it under pressure. He
scored 30 points in the city
championship game before 8000
people."
"He fits in well with what we
hope will be our style of play
from now on — the fast break."
Pitchford is familiar with the
fast break as St. John's played a
pressing, aggressive, fast
breaking game. At St. John's
Pitchford played under Joe Gal
lagher, one of the nation's win
ningest high school coaches.
Shooting strength
"I feel 1 can adapt to any style
of play," Pitchford said yester
day. "My main forte is shooting

but I feel I can drive to the hole
against a man-to-man defense.
"This year I played small for
ward but I think coach Dißiaso
plans for me to play guard. This
summer I'm going to work on my
penetration."
But Dißiaso demands more
from his players than just of
fense. Pitchford called himself
"an aggressive type player," one
who "dives for the loose ball."
Tourney MVP
The senior from Chevy Chase,
Md., was named Outstanding
Player in this year's Knights of
Columbus Tournament in D.C.
The K of C Tournament annu
ally fields the top eight teams in
the eastern United States. St.
John's lost in the finals to un
beaten West Philadelphia, the
No. 1 ranked prep team in the
nation, despite 16 first-quarter
points by Pitchford.
Pitchford chose to sign with
Stanford for the academics here
and a chance to play in the
Pacific-8.
"It's a great conference with

UCLA twice a year and USCand
the Arizona schools coming in."
Likes Dißo
Dißiaso was another factor in
Pitchford's decision to attend
the Farm.
"Coach Dißiaso is really easy
to talk to. He's only been there
two years and he's really turned
the program around. I see only a
bright future."
"Mark also has definite lead
ership qualities," Dißiaso said of
his latest recruiting coup.
Team leader
Pitchford assumed leadership
as co-captain of the St. John's
squad, a position of which he
seemed particularly proud.
"I like to accept challenges,"
Pitchford said. "I liked there
sponsibility of being captain.
"I go to a military school and
leadership is something that I'm
not unfamiliar with.
"I like challenges and I feel
that's why I did well in the city
championships. I like to meet
them head on. That's how I'm
going to approach Stanford."

Dißiaso was another factor in

two years and he's really turned

"Mark also has definite lead

Pitchford assumed leadership
as co-captain of the St. John's

"I like to accept challenges,"
Pitchford said. "I liked there

Basketball coach Dick Dißiaso
announced yesterday that Mark
Pitchford, a two-time All-
Washington D.C. eager, has
signed a national letter of intent
to attend Stanford. Earlier in the
week Dißiaso announced the
signing of two other prep bas
ketball stars, 6-foot-l Peter Lal
las from Eugene, Ore., and 6-7
Jeff Ryan from Winnetka, 111.
The 6-4 Pitchford averaged
19.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and
four assists per game while lead
ing St. John's Military Academy
to a 27-4 record and the
Washington D.C. city champ
ionship.
Later this spring, Pitchford
will play for the Washington
D.C. All-Star team against the
visiting Russian Junior All-
Stars.
Pitchford's team was also
ranked 10th nationally by Bas
ketball Weekly and first among
the nation's Catholic schools.
Clutch player
"Mark is a great prospect,"
Dißiaso said. "He's really
proven it under pressure. He
scored 30 points in the city
championship game before 8000
people."
"He fits in well with what we
hope will be our style of play
from now on — the fast break."
Pitchford is familiar with the
fast break as St. John's played a
pressing, aggressive, fast
breaking game. At St. John's
Pitchford played under Joe Gal
lagher, one of the nation's win
ningest high school coaches.
Shooting strength
"I feel 1 can adapt to any style
of play," Pitchford said yester
day. "My main forte is shooting

but I feel I can drive to the hole
against a man-to-man defense.
"This year I played small for
ward but I think coach Dißiaso
