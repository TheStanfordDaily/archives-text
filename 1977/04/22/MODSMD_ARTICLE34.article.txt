### 
The Student Athletic Commit
tee requested yesterday that all
students fill out and mail in the
questionnaires dealing with
Stanford athletics that students
received several weeks ago in the
mail. SAC member George
Pegelow said that a large re
sponse to the survey will give the
survey greater validity.
