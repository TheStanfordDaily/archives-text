Coach Payton Jordan's cin
dermen take a break from dual
meet competition this weekend
to compete in the Mount San An
tonio Relays today and tomor
row in Walnut.
Stanford has entered four in
dividuals and four relay teams in
the southern California meet.
"We are most anxious to
maximize our relay combina
tions, particularly in the 400 and
the 800," Jordan said. "The
competition will be extremely
hot."
Sprinters Marvin Holmes,
James Lofton, Cordon Banks and
Alan Sheats will team together
for both the 400- and 800-meter
relays.
The Cards' dash foursome has
a best of 39.8 in the 400 but wil 1
be up against the likes of Olym

pic 200-meter gold medalist Don
Quarrie and his Tobias Strider
teammates and Olympian Robert
Taylor and the Philadelphia
Pioneers.
For the Cards quartet to run in
the mid-39 second range, Jordan
said, "Our passes are going to
have to be absolutely perfect —
we're going to have to really
move the stick through the
zone."
Half-milers Scott Hickman,
Paul McCarthy, Mark Hadley
and Dave Wells will share the
baton in the two-mile relay
while Tom Shellworth (440),
Wells (880), Steve Crowley
(1320) and Jeff Parietti (mile)

relay. Shellworth will also run
the 400-meter intermediate hur
