## Athletic haberdashery in Encina 
### Julie Fiedler 
In the market for some jogging togs?
How about some Adidas tennis shoes?
Want something a little more fashiona
ble? How about a warm-up suit or a
jacket? Go look for them in Encina gym.
You might find it at the Gym Store.

Are you turned on by a piece of
cloth that has "Stanford"
emblazoned across the top of it?
Then the Stanford gym store is
your type of place.
But you might not have heard
of it.
Located in the bowels of En
cina Gym alongside a water
cooler, a coke machine and 14
steps from the IM office, the gym
store caters to Stanford jockdom.
All types
"We get all kinds in here,"
says gym stoi-e'manager John
Cavalli. He notes that his cozy
establishment receives a fair
amount of tourist trade and adds
that parents of students and op
posing teams often stop in to

pick up souvenirs.
The student clientele varies,
too.
"We get ail kinds around
here," Cavalli says. "Around
noontime we get a lot of running
freaks."
This was not always the case,

however. Encina used to be a re
stricted area. Females were for
bidden. Aside from depriving
the gym store of approximately
40 per cent of the available mar
ket here, he was also forced to
endure the presence of brazen
males: "I used to call it the BA

parade."
Cavalli joined the Stanford
staff in 1975 (the store is owned
and operated by the Stanford
athletic department). "I feel as if
I've adopted 10,000 new sons
and daughters since I started
here. Of all the jobs I've had this
is by far the most rewarding. I
love being around young girls
and kids. ... It keeps me
young."
Before Cavalli came out here
he ran "the best Italian restaur
ant in New Jersey." He did that
for about five years and also
worked for Hartz Mountain, Inc.,
before coming west.
Smiles
Cavalli's responsibilities in
clude buying for the store, in
ventory control, assignment of
lockers and handling the towel
exchange and laundry system.
He does all with a smile and a
kind word, according to those he
works around. "I come here fre
quently just to talk to the
people," one student said who
was browsing through some
merchandise.
The store carries a wide vari
ety of "Stanford" clothing —
T-shirts, shorts, various hats and
jackets.
And athletic equipment. Of all
sorts.
Squash racket
If you want a swim suit you
can get it there. Need a racket
ball? How about a squash racket?
The gym store carries top brand
names in many products includ
ing Adidas, Champion, Addin,
Munsingwear, Tretorn and
Puma — just to name a few.
"I come here because it's
cheaper and there are nice
people here," another browser
said.
Cavalli, whose son Gary heads
up the Sports Information De
partment, is aided by full-time
assistant Bruce Barnes and five
student employes.
