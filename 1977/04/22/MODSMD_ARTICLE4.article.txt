# Stanford action 'seems unlikely'
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
It "seems unlikely" that the Univer
sity will take any disciplinary action
against the students who were in
volved in the April 13 confrontation at
the Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC), according to James
Siena, legal adviser to the president.
"The decision is all but final," said
Siena, who has final responsibility in
the matter. He will give President
Richard Lyman his decision today.
The demonstrators still face the pos
sibility of charges being filed by the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office in Palo Alto.
"It's up to the DA to take what action
he thinks is warranted," said Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs.
Informal meeting
Representatives of the de
monstrators were informed of the
probable decision of the University at
an informal two-hour meeting yester
day between the representatives,
Rosenzweig, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington.
Rosenzweig said he "thought it was
a good meeting" and that one result
would be that future demonstrations
would be "more predictable and less
volatile."
Chris Coleman, one of the de
monstrator representatives, termed the
meeting "constructive."
"It was just a matter of improving
communications," he said.
Coleman said as a result of the meet
ing he feels that police will make an
effort to communicate at future de
monstrations, and will be able to "pick
us out of a crowd and talk to us."
Misconception
Lyman said Tuesday on KZSU's
Campus Conference .that de
monstrators on campus should avoid
the misconception that "you haven't
committed a crime unless someone

warns you you are committing one."
Whether the police gave the de
monstrators any warning before forc
ing their way through the group re
mains unresolved, Coleman said.
"It no longer matters at this point,"
he said.
Both sides strove to clarify their pos
itions in an effort to increase mutual
understanding and lessen the element
of surprise in the future, Rosenzweig
said.
The meeting came about in the wake
of an attempt by a group of about 25
students to block the entrance of a
marine recruiter to the CPPC a week
ago.
What exactly transpired during the
minute long struggle between police,
Capt. Paul kroeger and the de
monstrators at the rear entrance of the
CP PC has remained unclear because of
contradictory reports.

of surprise in the future, Rosenzweig
said.
The meeting came about in the wake
of an attempt by a group of about 25
students to block the entrance of a
marine recruiter to the CPPC a week
ago.
What exactly transpired during the
minute long struggle between police,
Capt. Paul kroeger and the de
monstrators at the rear entrance of the
CP PC has remained unclear because of
contradictory reports.

Marine recruiter Paul Kroeger pushes past protesters gathered before the
Career Planning and Placement Center last week. Police, administrators
and representatives of the demonstrators held an informal meeting yester
day at which the representatives of the protesters were told that it seems
unlikely the University will press charges against the protesters.
It "seems unlikely" that the Univer
sity will take any disciplinary action
against the students who were in
volved in the April 13 confrontation at
the Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC), according to James
Siena, legal adviser to the president.
"The decision is all but final," said
Siena, who has final responsibility in
the matter. He will give President
Richard Lyman his decision today.
The demonstrators still face the pos
sibility of charges being filed by the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office in Palo Alto.
"It's up to the DA to take what action
he thinks is warranted," said Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs.
Informal meeting
Representatives of the de
monstrators were informed of the
probable decision of the University at
an informal two-hour meeting yester
day between the representatives,
Rosenzweig, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington.
Rosenzweig said he "thought it was
a good meeting" and that one result
would be that future demonstrations
would be "more predictable and less
volatile."
Chris Coleman, one of the de
monstrator representatives, termed the
meeting "constructive."
"It was just a matter of improving
communications," he said.
Coleman said as a result of the meet
ing he feels that police will make an
effort to communicate at future de
monstrations, and will be able to "pick
us out of a crowd and talk to us."
Misconception
Lyman said Tuesday on KZSU's
Campus Conference .that de
monstrators on campus should avoid
the misconception that "you haven't
committed a crime unless someone

warns you you are committing one."
Whether the police gave the de
monstrators any warning before forc
ing their way through the group re
mains unresolved, Coleman said.
"It no longer matters at this point,"
he said.
Both sides strove to clarify their pos
itions in an effort to increase mutual
understanding and lessen the element
of surprise in the future, Rosenzweig
said.
