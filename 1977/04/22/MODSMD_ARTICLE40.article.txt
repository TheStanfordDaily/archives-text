High court refuses Watergate appeal
Washington — The Supreme Court has voted not
to review the Watergate cover-up convictions of
former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell and Nixon White
House aides H.R. HaJdeman and John Ehrlichman,
National Public Radio reported yesterday.
The station said the justices voted 5 to 3 at the
court's secret, weekly conference last Friday to deny
the three men's request for review. An announce
ment of the decision is being delayed by Chief Justice
Warren Burger because he hopes to convince two
other justices to switch their vote in favor of hearing
the case, the report said.
Mitchell and Haldeman have remained free pend
ing their appeal to the high court.
Ehrlichman, also convicted of conspiracy in the
so-called "Plumbers" burglary of the office of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist, entered the Swift Trail Fed
eral Prison Camp at Stafford, Ariz., last October to
begin serving his sentences, pending appeal. He was
sentenced to 20 months to five years in the Plumbers
case.
Quoting Supreme Court sources. National Public
Radio reporter Nina Totenberg said the three justices
who voted to review the case were Burger and Jus
tices Harry Blackmun and Lewis Powell Jr., all ap
pointed to the high court by former President
Richard Nixon.
The report said Burger hopes to sway Justices John
Stevens and Bryon White to change their votes.
U.S., Cuba resume maritime talks
Washington — The Carter administration is con
sidering the assignment of American diplomats in
Cuba for the first time since the 1961 break in rela
tions between the two nations.

At the same time, sources here said yesterday that
U.S.-Cuban maritime talks will be resumed shortly
in Havana with Terence Todman, the assistant sec
retary of state for inter-American ijffairs, heading the
U.S. delegation.
These developments suggest acceleration toward
the restoration of relations with Cuba after a break of
more than 16 years. However, one official here said,
"It's premature to expect that we would have some
one down there next week."
Todman would be the highest-ranked American
diplomat to go to Cuba since the United States broke
with the Castro regime.
Martial law enacted in Pakistan
Islamabad, Pakistan — Prime Minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto imposed martial law on three cities yes
terday in an attempt to stem growing political un
rest.
The decree bans all political activity and agitation
in the violence-torn cities of Karachi, Lahore and
Hyderabad.
It was the fourth time martial law has been im
posed since Pakistan gained independence in 1947.
The last was in 1969.
The three cities have been focal points for six
weeks of demonstrations by Bhutto's political oppo
nents, who claim the March 7 national elections
were rigged: They demand Bhutto's resignation and
dissolution of the National Assembly, in which the
prime minister's party won two-thirds of the seats.
Almost 200 persons have been killed in election
related violence in Pakistan since mid-January.
Administration tabs funds for Namibia
Washington — The Carter administration has de

cided to set up a $100-million contingency fund to
ease the transition to an independent Namibia once
the territory is set free by South Africa, informed
sources said yesterday.
John Gilligan, the new administrator of the
Agency for International Development, will an
nounce the action in testimony to Congress today,
the sources said.
South Africa's retention of the predominantly
black territory is opposed by most members of the
United Nations, and the administration supports the
transition to a majority rule.
The fund is designed to assist white landowners
who sell to blacks as well as give economic support
to a black-run Namibian government once it is
formed.
'Life without parole' bill defeated
Sacramento — A life-without-parole bill that sup
porters view as an alternative to the death penalty
fell one vote short of passage yesterday after a some
times bitter Senate debate.
But the measure's author, Sen. Milton Marks
(R-San Francisco), said he hoped to pick up enough
support for a future vote that would send the bill to
the Assembly.
"I think I have a pretty good chance of getting it,"
he said after the measure went down to defeat, 20-17.
Twenty-one votes were needed for passage.
The bill would provide a sentence of life without
possibility of parole for 16 crimes, including treason
and several types of first-degree murder.
