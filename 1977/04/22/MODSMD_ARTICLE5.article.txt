# 3,4,5 still up for grabs in spring housing draw

What treats await those students
who have yet to participate in the 1977
housing draw?
Numbers 3, 4, 5 and 5000 are among
the nearly 2700 numbers that remain
to be selected.
The spring housing draw ends today
at 4 p.m., but "if there is still a line
we'll stay open until the last person
has drawn," said Jean Kitaji, housing
office supervisor.
Kitaji stressed however, that the
housing office "encourages everyone
to get there as early as possible."
The number of students drawing has
averaged about 800 a day since Tues
day, Kitaji said, and the housing office
expects about the same today. Kitaji
noted that there had been "only about
2300 students so far" who have drawn.
Last year, 3586 students partici
pated in the draw, Kitaji said. She
added that the total number this year
should increase next week when the

housing office draws from the remain
ing numbers for students at overseas
campuses.
Props for this year's draw have been
donated by the Parker Brothers board
game company. The housing office
wanted to use the game "Monopoly"
as a theme, Kitaji said, and "needed
permission to use their board."
Not only did Parker Brothers okay
the idea, said Kitaji, but they donated
the houses and hotels that are included
with each draw number.
Kitaji said Parker Brothers also do
nated several board games which will
be awarded to persons drawing num
bers 1 and 5000 and to a few of those
students drawing the worst numbers.
Tresidder Union has included tic
kets to complimentary drinks at the
Transition with the draw numbers as
they have in previous years.
Results of round one will be availa
ble in early May, Kitaji said, and round
two results should be ready two to
three weeks later.
