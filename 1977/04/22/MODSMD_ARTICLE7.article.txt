# New COP has plans aplenty
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
Although the new ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP) only took office this
week, members already have many
plans in the making.
For the past week, they have been
meeting with President Richard
Lyman and Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
"We're trying to meet everybody to
find out what the hell's going on and
let people know what we're about,"
explained Co-president Clenn Jordan.
The new council consists of four
co-presidents instead of a president
and three vice presidents as was previ
ously the case.
The duties have been divided
among the four members. Greg Larson
will deal primarily with the improve
ment of teaching, advising, de
partmental associations, club sports,
ASSU services to students and
graduate student issues. Steve Westly
will work with University internships,
course requirements, gay rights,
fraternities and election reform. Co-op
housing, conservation and recycling,
and gay issues will be under the direc
tion of AnneHenkels. Jordan will take
charge of minority affairs and graduate
student issues.
Dance soon
The COP members are currently
working on holding an all-campus
dance in White Plaza three or four
weeks from now. They are presently
waiting to learn whether the ASSU can
legally distribute liquor. The event, if

held, will be open to graduate students
and off campus people, Westly said.
Another COP plan is to visit dormit
ory study breaks to meet students and
get their input. "We're making a big
effort to be more visible to the stu
dents," said Westly.
The COP has also submitted a prop
osal to get work study grants for three
students .to assist them. Two of the
students would be administrative as
sistants working on "substantive is
sues like being a student liason to the
overseas task force," said Larson. The
other student would be an office per
son handling correspondence and
scheduling theCOP's meetingsand ac
tivities such as study breaks.
Big job
"One of the biggest jobs we have
spring quarter is working on the
Nominations Committee," remarked
Henkels. The Nominations Committee
is composed of six students appointed
by the ASSU and is chaired by a COP
member (probably Jordan), said Lar
son.
The committee interviews and
selects students who are interested in
being members of University commit
tees such as the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aid, the Committee on Trustees, the
Committee to the President and about
25 others.
"Our chief priority is to publicize
the Nominations Committee so we can
get students who are involved and en
thusiastic," commented Henkels.

Henkels is also working with "Half
the Sky," an organization composed of
several women's groups on campus —
Battered Women, Women Against
Rape, Gay Women and others — to es
tablish one central women's center
where all women's groups can meet.
A Graduate Student Association
(GSA) is also a future possibility. This
association, which graduate student
Deric Jennings has been working on
for some time, would be similar to the
ASSU's function for undergraduates,
according to Larson.
The GSA would include a Student
Liason Committee distributing a
monthly newsletter on grad student is
sues, an Academic Affairs Committee
to work on improving the Teaching
Assistant (TA) and Research Assistant
(RA) programs, Graduate Awards
Committee responsible for fellow
ships, a Social Committee and Student
Affairs Committee to : mprove social
life and services for graduate students.
Jennings has applied for the Pierce
Memorial Award offered by the
Alumni Association. If received, the
$750 grant will get GSA off the ground,
said Jordan.
Grad booklet
An Approaching Stanford booklet
for graduate students is also being
planned for either this summer or next,
depending on how quickly University
funds can be mobilized to finance it.
said I^rson.
Jordan is also "looking into the
