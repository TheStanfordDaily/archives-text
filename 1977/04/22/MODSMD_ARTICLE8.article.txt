## Opinions The
						use of education 
### 
What the heck are you doing
here? If you are here to get a job
and not an education, then go get
a job.
As 1 approach the end of my
undergraduate career and very
possibly the last of my full-time
formal education, it dawned on
me that 1 had better figure out
what 1 have spent doing these
last four years.
1 knew that 1 wasn't here just to
get a job. But if an education
could be worth $H,()00 a year on
its own merits, I didn't know
what that merit was. After all,
there are a lot of people in this
world who get along just fine
without a college education.
Then suddenly, as 1 looked
back at my four years of social
science and humanities courses
in preparation for impending job
interviews, I figured out what 1
have gotten along with all of this
education.
It' was embarrassingly obvi
ous; it was in the preface of al
most every book I had read and
most of my professors had
started off their opening lectures
with an explanation of educa
tion: I was being given a means
by which to process the scads of
information with which my life
had been and would be inun
dated.
Some teachers called these

means "paradigms," some cal
led them "models," some "net
works," some "systems," some
"cells" and others "atoms."
Whichever name they chose
(depending on their field ot con
centration), they were all talking
about different conceptions of

reality.
There is no question that edu
cation is a very self-centered
pursuit. Only you can decide
which conception of reality you
best understand and can best
deal with. From this conception,
you can draw materials for sort
ing through your future observa
tions and reactions.
This is not to say that once you
receive a college degree on June
X of 19XX you automatically can
understand the world. Your col
lege education is merely an in
troduction to all of the realms of
understanding which could

exist in your life.
As you continue studying, you
may concentrate on one of these
realms or you may look for more
ways of looking at the world
which you have never ap
proached before.
The advantage of having an
education is that you have the
choice between different con
ceptions of the world. You are
not limited to the conceptions
which you happen to run across
in your daily life. Yours is the
ability to explore and seek out
different ways of answering the
questions which will occur to
you, both sacred and profane.
While you are Stanford, you
will receive more or less infor
mation, depending on how good
a student you are and how much
you study. If you don't study at
all, chances are that you will
come out of Stanford with little
introduction to the various sys
tems of knowledge which exist.
Itmay also be within therealm
of possibility that if you study
too much without taking the
time to relate these systems to
the world around you, you will
end up the same.
As 1 leave Stanford, I have a
feeling that I have just an inkling
of what lies beyond.
