Name the tyrannical leader in
George Orwell's 1984. Now,
name the tyrannical pig in Or
well's other dystopia, Animal
Farm.
1 suspect that you probably
had a harder time remembering
Napoleon of Animal Farm than
big Brother of 1984. Given the
fact that Animal Farm was writ
ten about a past event, the Rus
sian revolution, and that 1984
was written as u warning for the
future, and given recent disclo
sures about the secret bombing
of Cambodia and CIA payoffs to
foreign leaders, it's not surpris
ing that we are more sensitive to
the threat of Hig brother.
It's too bad, however, that in
being on guard against the spec
ter of Big Brother, an external
threat, we ignore the equally in
sidious threat of the Napoleon
which may lurk inside us all.
Last Tuesday, I had the un
settling experience of witnes
sing a sizable rally (in these
apathetic times 100 people is
sizable for any issue not directly
affecting Stanford students),
protesting the presence of a
Marine Corps recruiter at the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC).
The picketers were disturbed
by the corps' questionable hand
ling of the Pendleton 14. They
cared enough to come out and
make their feelings known.
Unfortunately, the de
monstrators chose to show their
antipathy for the presence of
things military by linking arms
in front of the entr
ances so that the marine recrui
ter would have to listen to them
before entering.
It wouldn't take too much im
agination to construe this as an

attempt to force one's ideas on
someone else. When Martin
Luther King protested the segre
gated Atlanta bus system, he
boycotted buses. The Atlanta
boycotters never physically pre
vented anyone from using a bus.
I suppose the bitter lesson of the
'60s might be that sterner mea
sures must be taken than
boycotts and publicity cam
paigns, that force must be met by
force.
After the security guards,
without warning, stormed
through the phalanx to permit
the marines to meet their ap
pointment, the protesters re
grouped to discuss their next
move. The speakers repeatedly
labeled the episode yet another
instance of the marines' habit of
using force before negotiation.
Even though I've never consi
dered blocking a doorway a good
example of reasoned persuasion,
I was pleased to see so many
people agree that arguing with
physical force is a bad thing.
In the midst of these exhortat
ory speeches which had as much
substance as a nominating
speech at a political convention,
a man on a bicycle spoke up.
Showing great calm, he argued
quite eloquently that no matter
what the marine recruiter came
to preach, as an American in
America, he had a right to say it.
Oddly, the immediate reaction
of the protesters was not to re
spond with reasoned arguments.
Instead, about 15 people, un
doubtedly carried away by the
strength of their convictions,
surrounded the man on the bicy
cle and started shouting at him.
The more emotional ones ac
cused him of being a Bircher and
an advocate of racism.
Some of the more reasonable
members of the group argued
that they were on private prop
erty paid for by Stanford stu
dents and therefore the recruiter
had no right to freely express his
views here. Most shouted that
the marines teach people to kill
and therefore can't come here to
say anything.
The man on the bicycle earned
my enduring admiration by
keeping his cool and calmly ar
guing back that precisely the
same reasoning was used to keep
anarchists and communists out
of this country.
He might have amplified this
by pointing out that the com
munists were denied the right of
free assembly because they ad
vocated the violent overthrow of
the United States. I'm sure that
the surrounding horde had no
violent intentions; but, if you've
ever been engulfed by 15 people,
all of whom are shouting at you,
you would know that their
strongest argument is usually
physical intimidation.
Somehow, it seemed odd that
people with such a dim view of
their fellows' ability to critically

evaluate the marine's pitch
would be optimistic enough to
believe armies unnecessary.
Meanwhile, the rest of the de
monstrators marched in tight
rank and file with military preci
sion down to the trustees meet
ing. I last heard the battal ion vot
ing on whether it should march
in chanting or clapping. I sus
pect they settled on something
like, "hup, 2, 3, 4."
I'm not picking on last Tues
day's demonstrators because
they represent the worst of us,
but because in many ways they
represent the best of us. They
were disturbed enough by the
racism at Camp Pendleton to
make a sincere attempt to do
something about it.
Few others here care enough
about the injustices of the out
side world to put in comparable
effort. My point is not that these
are hypocritical or stupid
people. My point is that they are
people and they should be aware
of the fact.
We should recognize the fact
that being able to spot the frail
ties of others does not make us
any less vulnerable to the same
foibles. We are, after all, fellow
human beings, not superior crea
tures. We should realize that it is
a greater shame to resort to phys
ical intimidation, name calling
and attempts to suppress an
tithetical opinions as forms of
argument when we, ourselves,
know that such behavior is mor
ally bankrupt.
We should realize that Animal
Farm has too much to say to us
for us to relegate it to the status of
a dim junior high memory of a
satire on bad revolutionaries. We
should realize that it's not di
rected just at Stalin and Trotsky,
but at us.
It is fine to feel things strongly
through the heart; but, before we
act, even in reaction to the most
reprehensible behavior, we must
think. If we recognize the pru
dence of critically appraising
our own behavior, if we heed
what Alexander Pope wrote in
his Essay on Man,
know then thyself, presume
not God to scan.
The proper study of mankind
is man
Placed on the isthmus of a
middle state
A being darkly wise and
rudely great:
With too much knowledge for
the skeptic side,
With too much weakness for
the stoic's pride...,
then perhaps when we do get our
chance to build a society free of
racism and Big Brotherism, his
torians of the future, when look
ing through the window of our
farmhouse of today, might be
able to tell the pigs from the
people.

evaluate the marine's pitch
would be optimistic enough to
believe armies unnecessary.
Meanwhile, the rest of the de
monstrators marched in tight
rank and file with military preci

I'm not picking on last Tues
day's demonstrators because
they represent the worst of us,
but because in many ways they
represent the best of us. They
were disturbed enough by the
racism at Camp Pendleton to
make a sincere attempt to do
something about it.
Few others here care enough
about the injustices of the out
side world to put in comparable
effort. My point is not that these
are hypocritical or stupid
people. My point is that they are
people and they should be aware
of the fact.
We should recognize the fact
that being able to spot the frail
ties of others does not make us
any less vulnerable to the same
foibles. We are, after all, fellow
human beings, not superior crea
tures. We should realize that it is
a greater shame to resort to phys
ical intimidation, name calling
and attempts to suppress an
tithetical opinions as forms of
argument when we, ourselves,
know that such behavior is mor
ally bankrupt.
We should realize that Animal
Farm has too much to say to us
for us to relegate it to the status of
a dim junior high memory of a
satire on bad revolutionaries. We
should realize that it's not di
rected just at Stalin and Trotsky,
but at us.
It is fine to feel things strongly
through the heart; but, before we
act, even in reaction to the most
reprehensible behavior, we must
think. If we recognize the pru
dence of critically appraising
our own behavior, if we heed
what Alexander Pope wrote in
his Essay on Man,
know then thyself, presume
not God to scan.

Name the tyrannical leader in
George Orwell's 1984. Now,
name the tyrannical pig in Or
well's other dystopia, Animal
Farm.
1 suspect that you probably
had a harder time remembering
Napoleon of Animal Farm than
big Brother of 1984. Given the
fact that Animal Farm was writ
ten about a past event, the Rus
sian revolution, and that 1984
was written as u warning for the
future, and given recent disclo
sures about the secret bombing
of Cambodia and CIA payoffs to
foreign leaders, it's not surpris
ing that we are more sensitive to
the threat of Hig brother.
It's too bad, however, that in
being on guard against the spec
ter of Big Brother, an external
threat, we ignore the equally in
sidious threat of the Napoleon
which may lurk inside us all.
Last Tuesday, I had the un
settling experience of witnes
sing a sizable rally (in these
apathetic times 100 people is
sizable for any issue not directly
affecting Stanford students),
protesting the presence of a
Marine Corps recruiter at the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC).
The picketers were disturbed
by the corps' questionable hand
ling of the Pendleton 14. They
cared enough to come out and
make their feelings known.
Unfortunately, the de
monstrators chose to show their
antipathy for the presence of
things military by linking arms
in front of the entr
ances so that the marine recrui
ter would have to listen to them
before entering.
It wouldn't take too much im
agination to construe this as an

attempt to force one's ideas on
someone else. When Martin
Luther King protested the segre
gated Atlanta bus system, he
boycotted buses. The Atlanta
boycotters never physically pre
vented anyone from using a bus.
I suppose the bitter lesson of the
'60s might be that sterner mea
sures must be taken than
boycotts and publicity cam
paigns, that force must be met by
force.
After the security guards,
without warning, stormed
through the phalanx to permit
the marines to meet their ap
pointment, the protesters re
grouped to discuss their next
move. The speakers repeatedly
labeled the episode yet another
instance of the marines' habit of
using force before negotiation.
Even though I've never consi
dered blocking a doorway a good
example of reasoned persuasion,
I was pleased to see so many
people agree that arguing with
physical force is a bad thing.
In the midst of these exhortat
ory speeches which had as much
substance as a nominating
speech at a political convention,
a man on a bicycle spoke up.
Showing great calm, he argued
quite eloquently that no matter
what the marine recruiter came
to preach, as an American in
America, he had a right to say it.
Oddly, the immediate reaction
of the protesters was not to re
spond with reasoned arguments.
Instead, about 15 people, un
doubtedly carried away by the
strength of their convictions,
surrounded the man on the bicy
cle and started shouting at him.
The more emotional ones ac
cused him of being a Bircher and
an advocate of racism.
Some of the more reasonable
members of the group argued
that they were on private prop
erty paid for by Stanford stu
dents and therefore the recruiter
had no right to freely express his
views here. Most shouted that
the marines teach people to kill
and therefore can't come here to
say anything.
The man on the bicycle earned
my enduring admiration by
keeping his cool and calmly ar
guing back that precisely the
same reasoning was used to keep
anarchists and communists out
of this country.
He might have amplified this
by pointing out that the com
munists were denied the right of
free assembly because they ad
vocated the violent overthrow of
the United States. I'm sure that
the surrounding horde had no
violent intentions; but, if you've
ever been engulfed by 15 people,
all of whom are shouting at you,
you would know that their
strongest argument is usually
physical intimidation.
Somehow, it seemed odd that
people with such a dim view of
their fellows' ability to critically

evaluate the marine's pitch

Luther King protested the segre
gated Atlanta bus system, he
boycotted buses. The Atlanta
boycotters never physically pre
vented anyone from using a bus.
I suppose the bitter lesson of the
'60s might be that sterner mea
sures must be taken than
boycotts and publicity cam
paigns, that force must be met by
force.
After the security guards,
without warning, stormed
through the phalanx to permit
the marines to meet their ap
pointment, the protesters re
grouped to discuss their next
move. The speakers repeatedly
labeled the episode yet another
instance of the marines' habit of
using force before negotiation.
Even though I've never consi
dered blocking a doorway a good
example of reasoned persuasion,
I was pleased to see so many
people agree that arguing with
physical force is a bad thing.
In the midst of these exhortat
ory speeches which had as much
substance as a nominating
speech at a political convention,
a man on a bicycle spoke up.
Showing great calm, he argued
quite eloquently that no matter
what the marine recruiter came
to preach, as an American in
America, he had a right to say it.
Oddly, the immediate reaction
of the protesters was not to re
spond with reasoned arguments.
Instead, about 15 people, un
doubtedly carried away by the
strength of their convictions,
surrounded the man on the bicy
cle and started shouting at him.
The more emotional ones ac
cused him of being a Bircher and
an advocate of racism.
Some of the more reasonable
members of the group argued
that they were on private prop
erty paid for by Stanford stu
dents and therefore the recruiter
had no right to freely express his
views here. Most shouted that
the marines teach people to kill
and therefore can't come here to
say anything.
The man on the bicycle earned
my enduring admiration by
keeping his cool and calmly ar
guing back that precisely the
same reasoning was used to keep
anarchists and communists out
of this country.
He might have amplified this
by pointing out that the com
munists were denied the right of
free assembly because they ad
vocated the violent overthrow of
the United States. I'm sure that
the surrounding horde had no
violent intentions; but, if you've
ever been engulfed by 15 people,
all of whom are shouting at you,
you would know that their
strongest argument is usually
physical intimidation.
Somehow, it seemed odd that
people with such a dim view of
their fellows' ability to critically

evaluate the marine's pitch
would be optimistic enough to
believe armies unnecessary.
Meanwhile, the rest of the de
monstrators marched in tight
rank and file with military preci
sion down to the trustees meet
ing. I last heard the battal ion vot
ing on whether it should march
in chanting or clapping. I sus
pect they settled on something
like, "hup, 2, 3, 4."
I'm not picking on last Tues
day's demonstrators because
they represent the worst of us,
but because in many ways they
represent the best of us. They
were disturbed enough by the
racism at Camp Pendleton to
make a sincere attempt to do
something about it.
Few others here care enough
about the injustices of the out
side world to put in comparable
effort. My point is not that these
are hypocritical or stupid
people. My point is that they are
people and they should be aware
of the fact.
We should recognize the fact
that being able to spot the frail
ties of others does not make us
any less vulnerable to the same
foibles. We are, after all, fellow
human beings, not superior crea
tures. We should realize that it is
a greater shame to resort to phys
ical intimidation, name calling
and attempts to suppress an
tithetical opinions as forms of
argument when we, ourselves,
know that such behavior is mor
ally bankrupt.
We should realize that Animal
Farm has too much to say to us
for us to relegate it to the status of
a dim junior high memory of a
satire on bad revolutionaries. We
should realize that it's not di
rected just at Stalin and Trotsky,
but at us.
It is fine to feel things strongly
through the heart; but, before we
act, even in reaction to the most
reprehensible behavior, we must
think. If we recognize the pru
dence of critically appraising
our own behavior, if we heed
what Alexander Pope wrote in
his Essay on Man,
know then thyself, presume
not God to scan.
The proper study of mankind
is man
Placed on the isthmus of a
middle state
A being darkly wise and
rudely great:
With too much knowledge for
the skeptic side,
With too much weakness for
the stoic's pride...,
then perhaps when we do get our
chance to build a society free of
racism and Big Brotherism, his
torians of the future, when look
ing through the window of our
farmhouse of today, might be
able to tell the pigs from the
people.

Name the tyrannical leader in
George Orwell's 1984. Now,
name the tyrannical pig in Or
well's other dystopia, Animal
Farm.
1 suspect that you probably
had a harder time remembering
Napoleon of Animal Farm than
big Brother of 1984. Given the
fact that Animal Farm was writ
ten about a past event, the Rus
sian revolution, and that 1984
was written as u warning for the
future, and given recent disclo
sures about the secret bombing
of Cambodia and CIA payoffs to
foreign leaders, it's not surpris
ing that we are more sensitive to
the threat of Hig brother.
It's too bad, however, that in
being on guard against the spec
ter of Big Brother, an external
threat, we ignore the equally in
sidious threat of the Napoleon
which may lurk inside us all.
Last Tuesday, I had the un
settling experience of witnes
sing a sizable rally (in these
apathetic times 100 people is
sizable for any issue not directly
affecting Stanford students),
protesting the presence of a
Marine Corps recruiter at the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC).
The picketers were disturbed
by the corps' questionable hand
ling of the Pendleton 14. They
cared enough to come out and
make their feelings known.
Unfortunately, the de
monstrators chose to show their
antipathy for the presence of
things military by linking arms
in front of the entr
ances so that the marine recrui
ter would have to listen to them
before entering.
It wouldn't take too much im
agination to construe this as an

attempt to force one's ideas on
someone else. When Martin
Luther King protested the segre
gated Atlanta bus system, he
boycotted buses. The Atlanta
boycotters never physically pre
