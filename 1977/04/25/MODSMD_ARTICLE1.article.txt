# Law students argue case in mock court
## 
### Jordan Lorence 
May a state restrict the right of attor
neys to advertise the availability and
cost of legal services?
Four law students grappled with
this question Friday before a mock
U.S. Supreme Court in the 25th annual
Marion Rice Kirkwood moot court
competition.
John Bogdanski and Robert Percival
won top honors over the other two
finalists, David Hayes and David Fair
weather. Friday's final round culmi
nated months of research, brief
writing and two nights of oral presen
tations for the four finalists and other
law students in the competition.
Each of the finalists submitted a 30-
page brief and presented oral argu
ments before a three-man "Supreme
Court."
Judges
One of the moot court judges, Justice
Stanley Mosk of the California Sup
reme Court, wrote the majority's opin
ion in the Bakke case. Justice David
Bazelon, a federal appeals judge for
Washington, D.C., and Justice Leon
Higginbotham, a federal judge from
Pennsylvania, completed the legal
triumvirate.
The justices sat at a red-draped table
on the stage of Kresge Auditorium.
Each of the four contestants — three of
whom wore three-piece suits — ad
dressed the court from a podium
placed in front of the judges.
Hayes started the competition by ar
guing that the advertising ban violated
the First Amendment and theSherman
Anti-trust Act. Before he could draw a
second breath, the judges began pep
pering him with questions.
Higginbotham was especially
thorough — at times, menacing. With
his eyebrows raised in doubt, he
probed every corner of each counsel's
arguments with his deep voice. The
real Supreme Court justices frequently
interrupt and badger the lawyers who
appear before them, more in an at
tempt to better understand the issues
than to frustrate the lawyers' presenta
tions.
Not all serious
The competition was not entirely an
intense, serious affair. At one point,
Mosk asked Bogdanski whether a state
could constitutionally ban laetrile and
saccharine. Bogdanski said that a state
could ban harmful products and their
advertising but added:
"1 submit to you that legal services
are not harmful to the public." The
court did not dispute his point.
After all the finalists had argued be
fore the court, the justices retired to
determine the winners. In moot court
competitions, the judges do not decide
the case, only pick the winners. Bog
danski was selected as the best overall
advocate. Percival was picked as the
author of the best brief and the second
best overall advocate.

Hayes started the competition by ar
guing that the advertising ban violated
the First Amendment and theSherman
Anti-trust Act. Before he could draw a
second breath, the judges began pep
pering him with questions.
Higginbotham was especially
thorough — at times, menacing. With
his eyebrows raised in doubt, he
probed every corner of each counsel's
arguments with his deep voice. The
real Supreme Court justices frequently
interrupt and badger the lawyers who
appear before them, more in an at
tempt to better understand the issues
than to frustrate the lawyers' presenta
tions.
Not all serious
The competition was not entirely an
intense, serious affair. At one point,
Mosk asked Bogdanski whether a state
could constitutionally ban laetrile and
saccharine. Bogdanski said that a state
could ban harmful products and their
advertising but added:
"1 submit to you that legal services
are not harmful to the public." The
court did not dispute his point.
After all the finalists had argued be
fore the court, the justices retired to
determine the winners. In moot court
competitions, the judges do not decide
the case, only pick the winners. Bog
danski was selected as the best overall
advocate. Percival was picked as the
author of the best brief and the second
best overall advocate.
