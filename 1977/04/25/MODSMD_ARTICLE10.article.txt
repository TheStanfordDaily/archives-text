# Activists' arguments irrational
## 
### 
David Deacon

In today's publications, we
find so many smears, distor
tions, and irrationalities that one
may be tempted, on seeing yet
another example of the same, to
toss the article into the garbage
bin and ignore it. However, it is
dangerous to follow this policy
— as people become accustomed
to seeing garbage in print, they,
in effect, forget that it stinks. It is
my purpose here to exhibit the
depth of irrationality to which
modern "activists" will stoop, if
unopposed.
One Don Moonshine, who is
presently agitating against the
Bakke decision, provides us
with an instructive example. In
his recent letters to the Daily, he
has asserted that the University
is "racist and sexist and elitist"
on the grounds that too many
white middle-class students at
tend Stanford, the University is
committed to intellectual excel
lence, Stanford does not grant
complete financial aid packages
to its students, the Hoover In
stitution does not support com
munism and the list goes on.
One is tempted, as I said, to
throw this kind of assertion into
the garbage can, because the
"evidence" is simply irrelevant
to the conclusion.
No argument has been pre
sented, and no counter
argument is possible except: It
doesn't follow.
Equivocation
But the technique being used
is more subtle. Practitioners of
this technique proceed by using
a word with a strong emotional
connotation such as "racist," but

switch the meaning of the term
when applying it to the oppo
nent.
The attempt is made to turn
the emotions of an inattentive
reader against the opponent
without having to justify such a
condemnation. Observe how
Moonshine uses this technique.
His conclusion is that Stan
ford is racist. The grounds are
that the admissions office dis
criminates in favor of intelli
gence and achievement instead
of in favor of certain groups
deemed by the authorities (such
as Moonshine?) to be
"minorities."
Now this does not support the
assertion that the University ac
cepts the principle of racism,
namely that a man's value is de
termined by his race. And yet he
calls Stanford's policy racist.
What, then, is his conception of
racism?
If you were ever able to pin
him down, his position would
come down to something like:
the proper principle of action is
always to go out of your way to
help minorities, and anybody
who doesn't do so is racist.
This, of course, is a variant of
the principle that a man's value
is determined by his race, only in
this case, "minorities" are the
select few who are more deserv
ing of admission to Stanford
than the rest of us.
Moonshine obviously does
not care to oppose racism for in
fact he implicitly supports it.
What, then, is his purpose? Let
us look at the effects of his word
garbling, and judge his purpose
therefrom. The first result of his

technique in the minds of his
victims is that the legitimate
meaning of the concept "ra
cism" is wiped out.
If a concept is stretched so far
that it includes its contradiction
then it is no longer a concept but
has been turned into a bromide.
And yet man's mind cannot
function without concepts.
Moonshine is no defender of
man's mind.
Force
But when reason is aban
doned, the only other way to
deal with men is by force. And
here is where Moonshine really
finds himself on home turf. As
he says in his article (Daily
March 28) on behalf of the Stan
ford Coalition Against the Bakke
Decision, what he wants is a
"broad-based united front... for
future actions."
Don't expect those actions to
include rational persuasion —
that's not what he wants: again I
let him speak for himself: "Let
there be not doubt about it: the
revolution will come."
However, power seekers of
this sort only succeed by default.
They succeed by inverting the
meanings of words, by ad
hominem attacks, by every per
version of reason in the book.
But these techniques only work
until someone identifies them
for what they are; then the game
is up.
Therefore, if your goal is to de
fend freedom (and it sorely lacks
competent defenders), don't let
the manipulators destroy reason
— for it is your only defense.

find so many smears, distor
tions, and irrationalities that one
may be tempted, on seeing yet
another example of the same, to
toss the article into the garbage
bin and ignore it. However, it is
dangerous to follow this policy
— as people become accustomed
to seeing garbage in print, they,
in effect, forget that it stinks. It is
my purpose here to exhibit the
depth of irrationality to which
modern "activists" will stoop, if
unopposed.
One Don Moonshine, who is
presently agitating against the
Bakke decision, provides us
with an instructive example. In
his recent letters to the Daily, he
has asserted that the University
is "racist and sexist and elitist"
on the grounds that too many
white middle-class students at
tend Stanford, the University is
committed to intellectual excel
lence, Stanford does not grant
complete financial aid packages
to its students, the Hoover In
stitution does not support com
munism and the list goes on.
One is tempted, as I said, to
throw this kind of assertion into
the garbage can, because the
"evidence" is simply irrelevant
to the conclusion.
No argument has been pre
sented, and no counter
argument is possible except: It
doesn't follow.
Equivocation
But the technique being used
is more subtle. Practitioners of
this technique proceed by using
a word with a strong emotional
connotation such as "racist," but

switch the meaning of the term
when applying it to the oppo
nent.
The attempt is made to turn
the emotions of an inattentive
reader against the opponent
without having to justify such a
condemnation. Observe how
Moonshine uses this technique.
His conclusion is that Stan
ford is racist. The grounds are
that the admissions office dis
criminates in favor of intelli
gence and achievement instead
of in favor of certain groups
deemed by the authorities (such
as Moonshine?) to be
"minorities."
Now this does not support the
assertion that the University ac
cepts the principle of racism,
namely that a man's value is de
termined by his race. And yet he
calls Stanford's policy racist.
What, then, is his conception of
racism?
If you were ever able to pin
him down, his position would
come down to something like:
the proper principle of action is
always to go out of your way to
help minorities, and anybody
who doesn't do so is racist.
This, of course, is a variant of
the principle that a man's value
is determined by his race, only in
this case, "minorities" are the
select few who are more deserv
ing of admission to Stanford
than the rest of us.
Moonshine obviously does
not care to oppose racism for in
fact he implicitly supports it.
What, then, is his purpose? Let
us look at the effects of his word
garbling, and judge his purpose
therefrom. The first result of his

technique in the minds of his
victims is that the legitimate
meaning of the concept "ra
cism" is wiped out.
If a concept is stretched so far
that it includes its contradiction
then it is no longer a concept but
has been turned into a bromide.
And yet man's mind cannot
function without concepts.
Moonshine is no defender of
man's mind.
Force
But when reason is aban
doned, the only other way to
deal with men is by force. And
here is where Moonshine really
finds himself on home turf. As
he says in his article (Daily
March 28) on behalf of the Stan
ford Coalition Against the Bakke
Decision, what he wants is a
"broad-based united front... for
future actions."
Don't expect those actions to
include rational persuasion —
that's not what he wants: again I
let him speak for himself: "Let
there be not doubt about it: the
revolution will come."
However, power seekers of
this sort only succeed by default.
They succeed by inverting the
meanings of words, by ad
hominem attacks, by every per
version of reason in the book.
But these techniques only work
until someone identifies them
for what they are; then the game
is up.
Therefore, if your goal is to de
fend freedom (and it sorely lacks
competent defenders), don't let
the manipulators destroy reason
— for it is your only defense.
