Sexism
In the recent election the band
printed an advertisement to pass
its fee assessments. The ad
pictured a woman's ample bust
protruding from a LSJUMB
t-shirt. The caption read "We
Need Your Support" followed
by A through DD reasons why.
The band is known for its
"clever" sexual humor. How
ever, there is a fine line between
sexual humor and sexist humor.
The band crossed that line
Imagine the poster showing a
frontal view of a man's crotch
(even though I'm not sure if
jock-straps come in A through
DD sizes). I doubt the members
would have found this equally
amusing. A measure of sexism is
whether men and women can be
interchanged in a given situa
tion. Unless the band can argue
that the woman could just as
humorously been replaced by a
man, the ad was sexist (disre

garding the issue of whether
anyone should ever be presented
as a sexual object). If the band
does believe a man could have
been substituted then they are
still left to explain why there
were no such posters.
Too bad the band didn't have
"the balls" to make a non-sexist
advertisement.

Concerning the letter in "Bug
Me" (Daily, April 20) about
senior class activities, the
senior class presidents are sorry
if "5.5.," the author of the letter,
had only heard about one out of
five of our happy hours.
Publicity is certainly a prob
lem for us; there are only four
senior class presidents and 1500

seniors. We advise that seniors
regularly check "Once Around
the Quad" as all senior activities
have been and will continue to
be announced there. In addition,
posters are hung around "The
Claw" in White Plaza, and smal
ler signs are posted throughout
the campus.
Senior Newsletters are on the
walls of every dorm and house
on campus; the Spring newslet
ter will appear Monday, April
25. Our worst problem has been
reaching off-campus seniors ( we
apologize to them) and our best
advice is that they follow OATQ
more closely.
We would appreciate any con
structive suggestions (leave
them in the ASSU loft) on adver
tising technique.

Congratulations
We would like to congratulate
the new ASSU Council of Presi

dents — Glenn Jordan, Greg Lar
son, Anne Henckels and Steve
Westley, and wish them much
success in what will undoub
tedly be an exciting year. We
offer our support and encour
agement.
Above and beyond that, we
want to sincerely thank all of the
fantastic peoplg who have
helped us wage what we con
sider a successful campaign.
Without your moral and manual
support we would not have sur
vived the high highs and low
lows.
It is people like you that make
it all worth the while. We love
you.

We have lived at "558
Mayfield" for a full academic
year and have witnessed the
jaded stares of residents fondly

admiring their Danish-cut furni
ture behind those locked doors
with the 1/3 hour fire ratings.
Again the University has
made a dreadful mistake that
will very likely cause the social
death of 50 students for the sec
ond year in a row (so to speak).
YettheUniversity has allowed
the perpetuation of this non
theme, non-priority, nameless
"Holiday Inn" strategically lo
cated in the bustling heart of
Stanford.
We therefore feel it our solemn
duty to forewarn those who have
drawn in the sub-50s that they
have condemned themselves toa
year in the socially malignant
anomaly at 558 Mayfield Av
enue. May they rest in peace.

In the recent election the band
printed an advertisement to pass
its fee assessments. The ad
pictured a woman's ample bust
protruding from a LSJUMB
t-shirt. The caption read "We
Need Your Support" followed
by A through DD reasons why.
The band is known for its
"clever" sexual humor. How
ever, there is a fine line between
sexual humor and sexist humor.
The band crossed that line
Imagine the poster showing a
frontal view of a man's crotch
(even though I'm not sure if
jock-straps come in A through
DD sizes). I doubt the members
would have found this equally
amusing. A measure of sexism is
whether men and women can be
interchanged in a given situa
tion. Unless the band can argue
that the woman could just as
humorously been replaced by a
man, the ad was sexist (disre

garding the issue of whether
anyone should ever be presented
as a sexual object). If the band
does believe a man could have
been substituted then they are
still left to explain why there
were no such posters.
Too bad the band didn't have
"the balls" to make a non-sexist
advertisement.

Concerning the letter in "Bug
Me" (Daily, April 20) about
senior class activities, the
senior class presidents are sorry
if "5.5.," the author of the letter,
had only heard about one out of
five of our happy hours.
Publicity is certainly a prob
lem for us; there are only four
senior class presidents and 1500

seniors. We advise that seniors
regularly check "Once Around
the Quad" as all senior activities
have been and will continue to
be announced there. In addition,
posters are hung around "The
Claw" in White Plaza, and smal
ler signs are posted throughout
the campus.
Senior Newsletters are on the
walls of every dorm and house
on campus; the Spring newslet
ter will appear Monday, April
25. Our worst problem has been
reaching off-campus seniors ( we
apologize to them) and our best
advice is that they follow OATQ
more closely.
We would appreciate any con
structive suggestions (leave
them in the ASSU loft) on adver
tising technique.

Congratulations
We would like to congratulate
the new ASSU Council of Presi

success in what will undoub
tedly be an exciting year. We
offer our support and encour
agement.
Above and beyond that, we
want to sincerely thank all of the

sider a successful campaign.
Without your moral and manual
support we would not have sur

It is people like you that make
it all worth the while. We love
