# Socialized medicine needs evaluation

In his recent article (Daily April
20), David Sartoris touches
lightly upon a number of issues
involving medical care delivery
and the nationalization of health
care services. I should like to
point out that the issues are not
that simple, and that neither Sar
toris' "facts" nor his solutions
are universally agreed upon.
These issues deserve more
careful scrutiny, if only because
they may mean the expenditures
of billions of dollars, the dis
placement of careers, and the
alteration of health services in
America.
First, the "current physician
shortage" has never been
adequately demonstrated; it is a
fiction of after-dinner speakers.
There are societies with fewer
physicians and better objective
standards of health care than the
United States, and conversely.
It has not been proven that
more doctors are needed; gobs of
money spent in increasing the
number of physicians may be
misspent. At most, the "physi

cian shortage" could be maldis
tributions with regard to geog
raphy, specialty and availability.
However, all efforts to define
maldistributions — and to estab
lish criteria to correct them —
have met with questionaable
success.
Second, Sartoris describes
the National Health Care Act of
1976 as a manifestation of "the
trend toward some form of or
ganized national health care." It
is no such thing. It is an attempt
to alleviate a putative shortage of
physicians in putative primary
care practices and to distribute
new physicians to putatively
physician-short areas. By no
stretch of the imagination will it
effect the delivery of health care
to most of the nation.
Third, I would like to agree
with Sartoris that a national
health system is imminent. But
"the medical care crisis" of the
early '70s was only a political
reality. It was never carefully de
fined, and was used as a tool for a
band of political interests at an

advantage time.
Over 600 bills dealing with na
tional health insurance were in
troduced in Congress between
1970 and 1974. The political
conditions have since evapo
rated. It is highly unlikely that a
synoptic and socially optimal
system will be adopted in the
near future.
Instead we may have to limp
along with the system we have,
suffering occasional well-meant
and impractical ameliorations.
It has been popular to write
laundry lists of goals for national
health insurance. (See, for
example, Herman Somers and
Anne Somers, "Major Issues in
National Health Insurance" (The
Millbunk Memorial Fund Quar
terly 50:177-210). But no one has
ever before suggested that put
ting physicians on salary will
decrease tfcieir use by the insured
public; evidence to the contrary
is quite well established.
It is unlikely that the national
cost of health care will remain
stable or decrease when national

health is introduced; insurance
is an established cause of infla
tion. (Martin Feldstein, in tes
timony to the Senate Subcom
mittee on Health, March, 1977,
pp. 216-19.)
Sartoris' desire is for "quality
health care to all regardless of
economic status" — a desire
shared by man. But for policy
makers, physicians and the pub
lic alike, this desire is not
enough.
National health care will have
the effect of redistributing re
sources, and this should be done
efficiently, with the greatest so
cial benefit exhaused from the
national expenditure.
But how is such a goal to be
fulfilled? A socially optimal
scheme may be achieved in
economic research and careful
thought on the real causes of in
adequate health care, but never
through pretty phrases and
cliched assumptions.
