# Admissions policies not racist

William C. Chace

Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig has
been reprimanded by Geoffrey
Creighton (Daily, April 7) for
engaging in levity at the expense
of Steven Hansch and Don
Moonshine. In their attack on
undergraduate admissions,
Hansch and Moonshine raise
serious questions, Creighton ar
gues; but unseemly Rosenzweig,
tragically impaired by a
"highly-evolved sense of
humor," is an elitist.
1 myself have of late been ac
cused of elitism, and by Moon
shine himself (Daily, April 6); he
has also found in me a "con
sciousness" that has rendered
me a racist and a sexist. In
meditating on these accusations,
I gradually sense rising within
me the telltale signs of levity. I
feel myself drawn irresistibly to
the belief that the arguments of
my adversary are absurd. The
rules of decorum therefore call to
me to retire from the enterprise
of answering him; I fear that in
doing so I might prove no more
than witty and right.
No discrimination
I shall steel myself, then, to say
only a few things: no dis

criminatory result of the current
admissions policy has yet to be
discovered by anyone, including
Moonshine, although he vag
uely alludes to such a result; the
admission of minority students
to Stanford continues apace with
remarkable energy and force, al
though he would pretend that
such affirmative action has been
retarded or given up; minority
students, contrary to his asser
tion, are indeed accorded a real
advantage in the "self-help"
component of financial aid; and
a considerable number of Stan
ford students might, I suspect,
take very strong exception to his
theory that they are no more than
the makings of "the necessary
intellectual manpower for the
perpetuation of oppressive in
stitutions."
The core of Moonshine's
thesis is that this university de
fines "intellectual excellence "
in ways prejudicial to minorities
and favorable to capitalism. (He
apparently possesses an under
standing of such excellence free
of these flaws, but he chooses not
to reveal it.)
He declines to recognize that
in its adherence to affirmative

action programs the Office of
Admissions does recognize the
deprivations to which minority
applicants have heen subjected
and evaluates their credentials
accordingly.
And in his murky efforts to
prove a link between Stanford
and oppressive capitalism, he
gestures toward a "host" of ac
tivities but specifies only three:
SRI, the Hoover Institution, and
the electronics industry of the
Santa Clara Valley.
But he knows that SRI and
Stanford parted company in
1970, and that the Hoover Instit
tuion is primarily a research lib
rary proud of a semi-autonomy
on this campus which simply
makes it unknown, for good or
for ill, to the mass of Stanford
students.
And the Santa Clara Valley is
there, but what of it? Some Stan
ford graduates do work in its in
dustries, but most do not. Some
faculty members consult there,
but most do not.
Whatever the activities of

those industries, Stanford is not
their necessary and efficient
cause. Nor can Stanford put an
end to those activities, even
should it wish. As it turns out,
there are things beyond the
reach of this university.
Stanford is not an ivory-tower,
nor does it pretend to be; but of
its lack of leverage on the Ameri
can economy there can be no
doubt. To argue otherwise is to
fear complexities, and to engage
in a mechanical and childish
Marxism.
1 now depart as soberly &s I
came, noting as I go that I am as
ignorant of Moonshine's con
sciousness as he is apparently
knowledgeable about mine. Be
tween us also seems to lie a dis
tinction in our abilities as mak
ers of argument: he is the more
persuasive the further he re
moves himself from the facts.
