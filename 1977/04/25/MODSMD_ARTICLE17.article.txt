# In S. Africa, Chile
## Computers for oppression? 
### 
New York (AP) â€” The question isn't new, but it
seems increasingly troublesome in a world in
which computer technology opens broad pos
sibilities for sophistication in political oppression.
Should a company sell a computer to a "fascist"
government, perhaps extending its capability for
tracking down its enemies?
The question has been posed the past four years
to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM),
the world's biggest manufacturer of data proces
sing equipment.
Now a group of church-related stockholders,
unhappy with what they see as IBM's moral per
formance, plans to raise the question again at the
corporation's annual meeting today.
The National Council of Churches and an af
filiate, Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibil
ity, plan to publicly ask IBM to stop all sales and
service of computers to the governments of South
Africa and Chile. IBM, for its part, plans no major
policy statement on the matter, which has come up
with regard to South Africa for the past four years,
a spokesman said.
"Our policy is that we obey U.S. laws and those
of other countries where we do business. We
would not knowingly sell computers for illegiti

mate purposes including the abridgment of human
rights," he said.
U.S. laws require government licensing for the
sale of computers that might pose national security
or defense questions. But the laws generally do not
regulate sales of their systems that could be put toa
variety of uses.
The church groups charge that IBM and other
computer companies have been supplying equip
ment for "questionable" purposes to South Africa
and Chile and other Latin American countries.
"A computer is a strategic product that can be
used in ways that assist them in keeping their
populations oppressed," said Timothy Smith of
the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.
"If you are going to sell a computer to South
Africa for the identification passbook system, you
become a partner in the mechanism of racial op
pression in South Africa," he argued.
Likewise, the Rev. William Wipfler, director of
Latin American affairs for the National Council of
Churches, said his group frequently is given re
ports that computers are adding new sophistica
tion to secret police agencies in Chile, which was
condemned for its use of torture in a United Na
tions report.
