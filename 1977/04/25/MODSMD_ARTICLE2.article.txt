# 1800 acres burned so far in forest fire

Yreka (AP) — California's biggest
forest fire of this drought year was con
tained last evening after burning 2000
acres of dry brush and timber in
Klamath National Forest.
Spokesmen said they had no esti
mate of when the fire would be offi
cially controlled and said 500 fire
fighters were expected to be on the
10-mile fire line through today.
Bob Dimmick, spokesman of the
U.S. Forestry division, said about 500
men battled the blaze about 25 miles
northwest of Yreka, including three
special crews called up from the state
Department of Corrections.
The blaze — codenamed "Buc
khorn" after a nearby ridge — was
about 60 per cent contained by about
11 a.m., he said. Damage was esti
mated at $2 million.
There were no evacuations and no
structures in the path of the blaze,
Dimmick said. No injuries were re
ported.
A forecast of high winds, threaten
ing gusts up to 30 miles-an-hour,
could hamper the effort, Dimmick
said. "The fire is stable unless we get
those winds," he said. "If we get those
winds we're probably in trouble."
Ten ground tankers and 12 bulldoz
ers were used to douse the flames and
dig fire lines.
The fire broke out Saturday after
noon north of State Highway 96 near
the Oregon border and swept over 300
acres in five hours. Crews continued
working through the night.
The area's timber and groundcover
is unusually dry and brittle because of
the state's stubborn drought, Dimmick
observed, causing the blaze to burn
with an intense heat comparable to a
late summer fire.
