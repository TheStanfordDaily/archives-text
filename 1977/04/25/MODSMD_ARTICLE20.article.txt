## UCLA cops team crown Mitchell wins Ojai title 
### 
Matt Mitchell disposed of both
UCLA's and USC's No. 1 men to
claim the singles title yesterday
in the Ojai Intercollegiate Tennis
Tournament.
Mitchell downed Southern
Cal's Bruce Manson 6-0, 6-3, in
yesterday's singles finals to take
the individual crown. Saturday
the Stanford sophomore beat
Ferdi Taygan, UCLA's top man
and the top-ranked amateur in
the nation, in straight sets, 6-2,
6-2, to advance to the finals.
Manson, on the other hand,
took three sets before defeating
Mitchell's teammate Bill Maze,
4-6, 6-3, 6-3, in the other semifi
nal match.
Although Manson seemed real
enough when he downed Maze
on Saturday, he appeared a bit
listless as Mitchell had an easy

time with him. Manson did not
come to the net nor did he
scramble after Mitchell's pas
sing shots which fell for win
ners.
Sick Manson
Mitchell excused Manson
after the match by saying that the
Trojan star had been under the
weather for the last month and
that the crowd had not seen the
real Manson in their match.
Perry Wright and Mitchell
teamed in the doubles final as
the sophomore from Palo Alto
went for a sweep of the tourna
ment titles.
But UCLA's Jon Paley-Tony
Graham ended thoughts of a
Mitchell double as they downed
the Stanford pair, 6-3, 6-4.
The doubles title was the

crowning match for the Bruins
who had clinched the team
championship (the Thatcher
Cup) before yesterday's competi
tion even began.
Mitchell and Wright had ad
vanced to the finals by defeating
Mike Newbury and Andy Luc
chesi of USC on Saturday, 7-6
(5-2), 6-4.
Stanford was resigned to sec
ond place while USC finished
third and California came in last.
Stanford finished third in last
year's Ojai competition.
In the women's play. Stanford
All-America Diane Morrison de
feated UC-Irvine's Jean
Nachand, 6-2,6-3, in the quarter
finals but fell to top-seeded Bar
bara Hallquist of USC, 6-2, 2-6,
2-6 in Saturday's semifinal
match.
