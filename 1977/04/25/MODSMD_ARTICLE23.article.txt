# Albritton, Parietti shine in Mt. SAC
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Shot putter Terry Albritton and 5000-
meter runner Jeff Parietti finished third in
their events to top showings by Stanford
athletes in the 19th Mount San Antonio Col
lege Relays.
Albritton, continuing to improve after a
pair of preseason injuries cut sharply into his
performance, broke his school outdoor mark
with a put of 65-3V2.
In addition to injuries to his hand and leg,
heavy weight training has kept Albritton
from reaching the distances he recorded dur
ing the indoor season when he topped 70
feet.
"Every athlete has up and down cycles,'
Albritton said. "You can't enjoy the highs,
unless you have the lows.
Recycled
"My body demanded another recycling.
I'm working to get my strength back. The

down cycles are nice. Right now I'm tearing
down the muscles in my arm."
"Usually you gear training so that you'll
feel good for the end of the season," Albrit
ton said. (The Pacific-8 Championships are
two weeks after this Saturday's Big Meet
with California.)
Parietti ran his best 5000 of the season
Saturday with a 14:23 clocking.
Back of the pack
The senior from Mercer Island, Wash.,
lagged 15 yards behind the leaders in the
back of the pack early in the race but moved
ahead of such notables as Olympian Paul
Geis and Ralph Serna to finish third. John
Gomez, a member of the Mexican Olympic
team, won the race in 14:08.
The 400-meter relay foursome of Marvin
Holmes, James Lofton, Gordon Banks and
Alan Sheats placed fourth in 40.2, as San
Jose State's Dedy Cooper edged Sheats at the

finish to give the Spartans third in 40.18.
"The best race of the day for us should
have been the 800 relay," Stanford coach
Payton Jordan said. He labelled it a "com
plete disaster."
Relay fiasco
Stanford's four sprinters — Holmes, Lof
ton, Banks, Sheats — lined themselves in an
order that the Cards had not used all season.
This came as a surprise to many — including
Jordan.
"I had gone up to the top of the stadium to
get a better view of their passes and didn't
know what was happening when Banks
lined up in the blocks," Jordan said.
"When they took it upon themselves to
change things completely, they also took
themselves right out of the race."
Race walker Sandy Briscoe, a Stanford
junior, finished third in the women's five
kilometer race.

ing the indoor season when he topped 70
feet.
"Every athlete has up and down cycles,'
Albritton said. "You can't enjoy the highs,
unless you have the lows.
Recycled
"My body demanded another recycling.
I'm working to get my strength back. The

down cycles are nice. Right now I'm tearing
down the muscles in my arm."
"Usually you gear training so that you'll
feel good for the end of the season," Albrit
ton said. (The Pacific-8 Championships are
two weeks after this Saturday's Big Meet
with California.)
Parietti ran his best 5000 of the season
Saturday with a 14:23 clocking.
Back of the pack
The senior from Mercer Island, Wash.,
lagged 15 yards behind the leaders in the
back of the pack early in the race but moved
ahead of such notables as Olympian Paul
Geis and Ralph Serna to finish third. John
Gomez, a member of the Mexican Olympic
team, won the race in 14:08.
The 400-meter relay foursome of Marvin
Holmes, James Lofton, Gordon Banks and
Alan Sheats placed fourth in 40.2, as San
Jose State's Dedy Cooper edged Sheats at the

finish to give the Spartans third in 40.18.
"The best race of the day for us should
have been the 800 relay," Stanford coach
Payton Jordan said. He labelled it a "com
plete disaster."
Relay fiasco
Stanford's four sprinters — Holmes, Lof
ton, Banks, Sheats — lined themselves in an
order that the Cards had not used all season.
This came as a surprise to many — including
Jordan.
"I had gone up to the top of the stadium to
get a better view of their passes and didn't
know what was happening when Banks
lined up in the blocks," Jordan said.
"When they took it upon themselves to
change things completely, they also took
themselves right out of the race."
Race walker Sandy Briscoe, a Stanford
junior, finished third in the women's five
kilometer race.
