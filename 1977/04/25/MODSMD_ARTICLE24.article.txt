# But USC takes 2 of 3
## Card nine snaps Trojan skein 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
handed undefeated USC its first
loss in Pacific-8 league play yes
terday after dropping games Fri
day and Saturday, 20-4 and 9-4.
Stanford turned the tables on the
Trojans yesterday winning 11-3
and totaling 10 hits, including a
grand slam by first basemanTom
Guardino.
Sophomore lefthander Rob
Irwin went the distance for the
Cardinals, turning in an excel

lent performance, yielding only
six hits and giving up no earned
runs.
Stanford suffered two losses to
the No. 7 ranked Trojans on Fri
day and Saturday afternoons in
front of two of the largest home
crowds this season. USC col
lected a total of 35 hits in the first
two games of the series, includ
ing six home runs.
Big hits
Home runs and big hits have
beaten Stanford now in three out

of four of its league series. In
their first meeting with Stanford,
the Trojans tagged Card hurlers
for five home runs. Then in Stan
ford's second league matchup,
UCLA whacked six home runs,
helping the Bruins sweep that
series.
With the exception of those
series, the Cardinals have been
contenders in every game
they've played, proven by their
38-16 season record.
"It's a very tough league,"

coach Mark Marquess com
mented, contemplating the dis
parity between Stanford's sea
son record and league record.
"Often times a team, even
though they don't look that im
pressive early in the season,
plays their best in league."
"We played well and got the
key hits in the San Jose Tourna
ment, but we're not doing that
now. We haven't played poorly
. . . we've been beaten."
Hitting hard
USC put on a "very good
show" over the weekend, play
ing the best ball they've played
all season. They hit Stanford re
lievers Larry Kuhn, Rick
Hallstead and Bruce Davis hard
in the ninth inning of Friday's
game, knocking out 11 hits for 11
runs before the Cards could re
tire the side.
Stanford starter Brian Harri
son, although pitchingoneofhis
finest performances of the year,
was also tagged for nine hits in
Saturday's game while Stanford
piled up seven hits but brought
in only four runs. The loss puts
Harrison at 8-4 for the year.
Stanford comeback
Yesterday the Trojans jumped
out to a three-run lead in the top
of the third inning, threatening
Stanford for the last time. In the
bottom of the inning, the Cards
scored seven runs on four walks,
a couple key basehits and a
homerun with the bags bulging
by Guardino.
Stanford worked its way
through three Trojan relievers,
adding three more runs in the
fourth and another in the fifth,
while Irwin held USC to just two
hits for the rest of the game.
Coach Marquess called
baseball an "up and down
sport," and this weekend proved
that.
But you can bet that in two
weeks when the Cardinals meet
UCLA at home, they're going to
be "up."

yesterday.

The Stanford baseball team
handed undefeated USC its first
loss in Pacific-8 league play yes
terday after dropping games Fri
day and Saturday, 20-4 and 9-4.
Stanford turned the tables on the
Trojans yesterday winning 11-3
and totaling 10 hits, including a
grand slam by first basemanTom
Guardino.
Sophomore lefthander Rob
Irwin went the distance for the
Cardinals, turning in an excel

lent performance, yielding only
six hits and giving up no earned
runs.
Stanford suffered two losses to
the No. 7 ranked Trojans on Fri
day and Saturday afternoons in
front of two of the largest home
crowds this season. USC col
lected a total of 35 hits in the first
two games of the series, includ
ing six home runs.
Big hits
Home runs and big hits have
beaten Stanford now in three out

of four of its league series. In
their first meeting with Stanford,
the Trojans tagged Card hurlers
for five home runs. Then in Stan
ford's second league matchup,
UCLA whacked six home runs,
helping the Bruins sweep that
series.
With the exception of those
series, the Cardinals have been
contenders in every game
they've played, proven by their
38-16 season record.
"It's a very tough league,"

coach Mark Marquess com
mented, contemplating the dis
parity between Stanford's sea
son record and league record.
"Often times a team, even
though they don't look that im
pressive early in the season,
plays their best in league."
"We played well and got the
key hits in the San Jose Tourna
ment, but we're not doing that
now. We haven't played poorly
. . . we've been beaten."
Hitting hard
USC put on a "very good
show" over the weekend, play
ing the best ball they've played
all season. They hit Stanford re
lievers Larry Kuhn, Rick
Hallstead and Bruce Davis hard
in the ninth inning of Friday's
game, knocking out 11 hits for 11
runs before the Cards could re
tire the side.
Stanford starter Brian Harri
son, although pitchingoneofhis
finest performances of the year,
was also tagged for nine hits in
Saturday's game while Stanford
piled up seven hits but brought
in only four runs. The loss puts
Harrison at 8-4 for the year.
Stanford comeback
Yesterday the Trojans jumped
out to a three-run lead in the top
of the third inning, threatening
Stanford for the last time. In the
bottom of the inning, the Cards
scored seven runs on four walks,
a couple key basehits and a
homerun with the bags bulging
by Guardino.
Stanford worked its way
through three Trojan relievers,
adding three more runs in the
fourth and another in the fifth,
while Irwin held USC to just two
hits for the rest of the game.
Coach Marquess called
baseball an "up and down
sport," and this weekend proved
that.
But you can bet that in two
weeks when the Cardinals meet
UCLA at home, they're going to
be "up."
