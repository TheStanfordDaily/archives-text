# Spikers win Nor Cal tourney
## Cards earn regional slot 
### Stacy Geiken 
Stanford won the Northern California Confer
ence Championships in Chico Friday to help sec
ure its berth in the NCAA regionals.
The Cardinals downed California in the first
match of the conference tournament, 15-3, 15-10,
15-13. The Cards also beat the Bears in three
straight games in competition earlier this season.
According to volleyball coach Art Lambert, the
Cards "won easily" and substituted frequently be
cause they were "confident of winning."
The Cards' three-game win over the Bears put
them in the finals against Chico State on its home
turf.
Homecourt advantage
The Cards not only had to face Chico State in the
finals, but about 1000 Chico volleyball fans as
well, Lambert said.
"It was like we were against the whole gym,"
setter Andy Fishburn said.
During one volley in the first game, Fishburn
said that it looked like Chico was going to be
tough.
"But once that was overcome," Fishburn said,
"we just plowed right through."
"That's the first time we really had it all together
against a good team," Fishburn added.
Wendell Birkhofer, who had to sit out the Chico
game because of a persistent back injury, said that
the fans made it known who they were for.
Sounds of silence
"But pretty soon, there was dead silence," Bir
khofer said. The silence came after the Cards
opened up a 10-2 lead.
Birkhofer said that in previous play against
tough teams, the Cards "usually let up" but "Art
(Lambert) gave a great pep talk" and the team
"poured it on," winning 15-5, 15-5 in the last two
games.
"Duralde was so psyched and he played superb

volleyball," Birkhofer added.
Lambert said that the Card defense "blocked
very, very well," and the offense "put down a lot of
balls."
Coach feels 'super' *
Fifteen minutes after hearing of the Cards' reg
ional selection, Lambert said that it felt "super"
and added that selection was a "giant step" for
Northern California schools and Stanford in par
ticular.
"Under intercollegiate rules (Stanford vol
leyball was a club sport last year) this is the first
time a northern school has been selected for NCAA
regional competition," Lambert said.
The regionals begin Friday night in Santa Bar
bara.
"We are delighted to be in the regionals," said
Lambert.
Lambert also said that the Cards "will be at full
strength" with Birkhofer being the "only question
mark" because of injury.
UCLA beatable
UCLA lost to Pepperdine and USC to help the
Cards gain a berth in the regionals.
Ironically, it is the No. 1 seeded team — UCLA —
that the Cards face in the four-team playoff in Santa
Barbara.
The Cards lost to UCLA, 15-12, 15-10, 15-9, ear
lier this season. But Card players have maintained
recently that they are capable of giving UCLA a
much tougher game.
"We know how they (UCLA) play, if we go all
out, we could win," Fishburn said.
If the Cards do win, they then have a shot at the
NCAA Championships May 6.
The team seems to be playing consistent, high
quality volleyball and Birkhofer's attitude reflects
that confidence:
"That night (against Chico) our team would
have given any team in the country a good match."
