# Watson third in New Orleans Open
## 
### 
New Orleans (AP) — Un
heralded Jim Simons charged
out of the pack with a pair of 67s
and held off an even more
obscure member of the pro golf
tour, Stan Lee, to win the
$175,000 New Orleans Open
tournament Sunday.
With the field playing 36 holes
Sunday because rain forced
postponement of play Thursday,
Simons finished with a 15-
under-par total of 273 on the
7080-yard Lakewood Country
Club course. Lee shot rounds of
70 and 69 Sunday for 276.
Lee, 24, held the lead briefly in
his final, erratic round. He
bogeyed the ninth and 11 holes,
strung together four straight bir
dies to get back in the chase but
knocked himself back out of it by

finishing with three straight
bogeys.
Watson passed
Simons, starting from three
strokes off the pace, passed up
Masters champion Tom Watson
en route to victory. After starting
with two 68s, Watson finished
71-70 Sunday for 277.
The victory was Simons' first
in five years on the pro tour, and
his $35,000 check moved him
from 42nd to 10th on this year's
money-winning list.
The 26-year-old's previous
best finish was a tie for third at
Inverrary last February. Lee, a
hometown favorite from Baton
Rouge who is in his second year
on the tour, had won only $203
this year until he picked up
$19,950 Sunday.

Lou Graham and Ben Cren
shaw finished at 10-under-par
278. Graham, the 1975 U.S.
Open champion, shot a pair of
69s Sunday while Crenshaw
carded 71-69.
One up
Simons held a one-stroke lead
over Watson, Lee and Ed
Dougherty going into the final
18 holes Sunday.
Simons' 67 for the day's first
round included a pair of chip
ins. Playing the back nine first,
he found the hole from 25 feet on
No. 16 and from 50 feet on No.
18.
Simons appeared to be in
command approaching the 17th

hole in his final round. However",
he pushed his tee shot into the
gallery on the 210-yard par-3
and had to chip out and putt
twice from 20 feet for bogey.
This was happening while Lee
hammered in his fourth con
secutive birdie on the 15th,
deadlc .king the tournament
until over the final
three h les.

$175,000 New Orleans Open
tournament Sunday.
With the field playing 36 holes
Sunday because rain forced
postponement of play Thursday,
Simons finished with a 15-
under-par total of 273 on the
7080-yard Lakewood Country
Club course. Lee shot rounds of
70 and 69 Sunday for 276.
Lee, 24, held the lead briefly in
his final, erratic round. He
bogeyed the ninth and 11 holes,
strung together four straight bir
dies to get back in the chase but
knocked himself back out of it by

finishing with three straight
bogeys.
Watson passed
Simons, starting from three
strokes off the pace, passed up
Masters champion Tom Watson
en route to victory. After starting
with two 68s, Watson finished
71-70 Sunday for 277.
The victory was Simons' first
in five years on the pro tour, and
his $35,000 check moved him
from 42nd to 10th on this year's
money-winning list.
The 26-year-old's previous
best finish was a tie for third at
Inverrary last February. Lee, a
hometown favorite from Baton
Rouge who is in his second year
on the tour, had won only $203
this year until he picked up
$19,950 Sunday.

Lou Graham and Ben Cren

278. Graham, the 1975 U.S.
Open champion, shot a pair of
69s Sunday while Crenshaw
carded 71-69.

secutive birdie on the 15th,
