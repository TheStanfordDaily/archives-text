Experts to cap North Sea oil spill
Stavanger, Norway — American experts
will try today to cap a runaway oil well that has
been spewing millions of gallons of crude oil
into the North Sea.
Norwegian authorities said yesterday the
12-mile-long slick flowing from the offshore
well had begun to dissipate and was turning
away from the coasts of Norway and Denmark.
The Phillips Petroleum Co. said the decision
to seal off the leak at drilling platform "Bravo"
was made yesterday after specialists from a
Houston, Tex., company were set down by
helicopter on the oil-covered midsea rig.
Phillips said they found that the rig had es
caped damage when a pipe exploded Friday
night, setting off a 180-foot-high geyser of oil
that spilled into the surrounding sea.
The specialists, Boots Hansen and Richard
Hattenberg of the Red Adair Oil Well Fire and
Blowout Prevention Co., reported the blowout
was partial and that an underwater safety valve
was keeping some of the oil from spilling.
A Phillips spokesman estimated the capping
operation would take one to three days, de
pending on weather conditions.
He said another well would be drilled at the
spill site to relieve some of the pressure forcing
oil into the sea at the rate of 49,000 gallons an
hour.
Meanwhile, officials were also mapping
plans for cleaning up the slick, estimated at
between two and five miles wide. Hans Bugge,
chief of the Norwegian cleanup operation, said
crews would use special equipment to skim the
oil from the water starting today.
Phillips spokesman Sto Lerdal estimated the
spill as of yesterday at between 1.7 millionand
2.2 million gallons. The largest oil spill on
record was 2.9 million gallons, which poured
from the supertanker Torrey Canyon off south
eastern England in May 1967.
Gov't troops gain in Zaire
Lubudi River, Zaire — Government troops,
moving slowly along roads mined by retreat
ing Katangan rebels, sought yesterday to encir
cle the key railroad junction town of Mut
shatsha.
The town is the main goal of a 10-day-old

Zairean counter-offensive against the Katan
ga ns who invaded from Angola March 8.
Troops advanced cautiously down the same
dusty roads the invaders used in their attack
toward the copper mining town of Kolwezi in
Shaba province, formerly known as Katanga.
An estimated 2000 Katangan exilesareinthe
invasion army. They are led by veterans ot the
late Moise Tshombe's paramilitary police
force, who fled to Angola after the failure of
Tshombe's first attempt in the early 1900s to
severe the mineral-rich province from the rest
of the country.
Fighting erupts in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian troops and tanks
battled radical Palestinian guerrillas for the
second straight day yesterday on the outskirts
of Beirut's Sabra Palestinian refugee camp.
Unofficial reports said at least two persons
were killed in the fighting near Beirut's inter
national airport. But Palestinian sources said
the number of casualties could not be deter
mined immediately because ambulances were
unable to reach the battle area.
In Israel yesterday, a newspaper quoted De
fense Minister Shimon Peres, who has taken
over the duties of prime minister, as saying
Israel would intervene to protect Christian vil
lages in south Lebanon from Palestinian guer
rillas.
The Syrians used Russian-made T54 and
T62 tanks and columns of armored personnel
carriers to lay siege to radical guerrilla stron
gholds at the Sabra camp.
The outbreak of fighting followed the kidnap
of a radical guerrilla leader Thursday and the
slaying oftwoSyrian soldiers Friday, allegedly
by Palestinian radicals.
UN report raps energy concern
New York — Estimates compiled by experts
at a U.N. conference disagree with President
Jimmy Carter's televised warning that "we are
now running out of gas and oil." They hold
that the world probably has enough of both for
another hundred years.
A newly issued summary report of last
summer's conference says the dozens of
specialists who attended generally agreed that

oil and gas from conventional sources "would
last at least until about the time period 2020-
2030."
The summary said the consensus at the con
ference was that, as rising prices make it
economical to tap new sources, "additional
petroleum and gas resources would most prob
ably be available, albeit at a substantially
higher cost . . . during the period of transition
to the use of renewable energy sources, even if
this transition period should last a hundred
years or more."
Governors urge NW oil route
Olympia, Wash. — Governors of several
north-western and north-central states urged
yesterday that the state of Washington become
a transshipment point for Alaskan crude oil to
their landlocked refineries.
The governors' resolution indicated a dis
trust of the Canadian government and propos
als that Alaskan oil be tunneled to the Midwest
through an existing Canadian pipeline.
But the governors said they believed it was
strictly up to Washington state to determine
where an oil port should be located.
Washington Gov. Dixy Lee Ray said adoption
of the resolution did not mean she was ready to
set aside the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s plan to
ship crude from Alaska to Washington and
then via pipelines, including Canadian ones,
to midwestern states.
The governors and representatives of 13
states met behind closed doors all day to dis
cuss the question of shipment of Alaskan oil to
interior U.S. points.
Supplies of Canadian oil to refineries to
those states are being cut off and the refineries
are looking to Washington state as a possible
funnel through which Alaskan oil could flow.
Dirty air might prevent coal use
Washington — Some areas with severe air
pollution problems, such as California and
New York City, might be exempted from man
datory conversion to coal under President Car
ter's new energy program. White House energy
adviser James Schlesinger said yesterday.
"There will probably be some parts of the
country where we will be unable to burn coal,"

Schlesinger said.
He made his remarks on the CBS television
program Face The Nation.
Schlesinger said the goal to achieve one bill
ion tons of coal production by 1985 probably
will not mean a lessening of environmental
standards.
"We are attempting to avoid any rollback of
environmental protection," he said. "But some
states have unique problems. Air pollution is a
far more serious problem in California than it is
elsewhere."
Experts see lower farm prices
Sacramento — Two economists said yester
day the drought will probably be less costly
than has been predicted.
Eric Thor was quoted by The Sacramento
Bee as saying the price of fresh vegetables may
rise in late summer and early fall, but he
doesn't see any major price increases for other
crops. He had earlier predicted higher costs for
rice, beef, fruit and other products.
He now says fruits and vegetables for can
ning will be in ample supply.
Although Thor said beef prices may rise late
in the year, "that's not due just to the present
drought. It's due to a couple of years of drought
and it's due to drought in other areas of the
country."
He added that dairy farmers are paying more
for feed, but this doesn't mean the state De
partment of Food and Agriculture will permit
boosts in milk prices.
Pauline Sweezey, chief economist for the
state Department of Finance, said the drought
loss, even in farm income, should be only
about half the most recent estimate of the De
partment of Food and Agriculture.
Sweezey estimates farm income to drop
about $500 million, or five per cent. She said a
preliminary study shows there might not be
large impact on the state as a whole.
The most recent estimate of the Department
of Food and Agriculture puts the loss at bet
ween $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.
Brown criticizes ecoiogists
San Francisco — Covernor Edmund Brown
Jr. voiced criticism of environmental lobbyists

in a newspaper interview yesterday, saying
Californians concerned with the state's ecolog
ical health were not being well represented.
In an interview with the San Francisco
Examiner. Brown said the lobbyists "seem to
be losing their effectiveness."
In the wide-ranging talk, Brown also had
some harsh words for San Francisco school
officials whom he said lacked initiative. And
he shrugged off suggestions he was making a
second run for the presidency.
Brown reiterated a promise to veto any bill
that increases local taxes in the face of court
mandated school financing reforms.
Brown said he supported the school finance
reform bill introduced by Assemblyman Leroy
Greene (D-Sacramento) that was offered up in
the wake of the Serrano decision by the
California Supreme Court.

Washington — Some areas with severe air
pollution problems, such as California and
New York City, might be exempted from man
datory conversion to coal under President Car
ter's new energy program. White House energy
adviser James Schlesinger said yesterday.
"There will probably be some parts of the
country where we will be unable to burn coal,"

Schlesinger said.
He made his remarks on the CBS television
program Face The Nation.
Schlesinger said the goal to achieve one bill
ion tons of coal production by 1985 probably
will not mean a lessening of environmental
standards.
"We are attempting to avoid any rollback of
environmental protection," he said. "But some
states have unique problems. Air pollution is a
far more serious problem in California than it is
elsewhere."
Experts see lower farm prices
Sacramento — Two economists said yester
day the drought will probably be less costly
than has been predicted.
Eric Thor was quoted by The Sacramento
Bee as saying the price of fresh vegetables may
rise in late summer and early fall, but he
doesn't see any major price increases for other
crops. He had earlier predicted higher costs for
rice, beef, fruit and other products.
He now says fruits and vegetables for can
ning will be in ample supply.
Although Thor said beef prices may rise late
in the year, "that's not due just to the present
drought. It's due to a couple of years of drought
and it's due to drought in other areas of the
country."
He added that dairy farmers are paying more
for feed, but this doesn't mean the state De
partment of Food and Agriculture will permit
boosts in milk prices.
Pauline Sweezey, chief economist for the
state Department of Finance, said the drought
loss, even in farm income, should be only
about half the most recent estimate of the De
partment of Food and Agriculture.
Sweezey estimates farm income to drop
about $500 million, or five per cent. She said a
preliminary study shows there might not be
large impact on the state as a whole.
The most recent estimate of the Department
of Food and Agriculture puts the loss at bet
ween $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.
Brown criticizes ecoiogists
San Francisco — Covernor Edmund Brown
Jr. voiced criticism of environmental lobbyists

in a newspaper interview yesterday, saying
Californians concerned with the state's ecolog

In an interview with the San Francisco
Examiner. Brown said the lobbyists "seem to
be losing their effectiveness."
In the wide-ranging talk, Brown also had
some harsh words for San Francisco school
officials whom he said lacked initiative. And
he shrugged off suggestions he was making a
second run for the presidency.
Brown reiterated a promise to veto any bill
that increases local taxes in the face of court
mandated school financing reforms.
Brown said he supported the school finance
reform bill introduced by Assemblyman Leroy
Greene (D-Sacramento) that was offered up in
the wake of the Serrano decision by the
California Supreme Court.

Experts to cap North Sea oil spill
Stavanger, Norway — American experts
will try today to cap a runaway oil well that has
been spewing millions of gallons of crude oil
into the North Sea.
Norwegian authorities said yesterday the
12-mile-long slick flowing from the offshore
well had begun to dissipate and was turning
away from the coasts of Norway and Denmark.
The Phillips Petroleum Co. said the decision
to seal off the leak at drilling platform "Bravo"
was made yesterday after specialists from a
Houston, Tex., company were set down by
helicopter on the oil-covered midsea rig.
Phillips said they found that the rig had es
caped damage when a pipe exploded Friday
night, setting off a 180-foot-high geyser of oil
that spilled into the surrounding sea.
The specialists, Boots Hansen and Richard
Hattenberg of the Red Adair Oil Well Fire and
Blowout Prevention Co., reported the blowout
was partial and that an underwater safety valve
was keeping some of the oil from spilling.
A Phillips spokesman estimated the capping
operation would take one to three days, de
pending on weather conditions.
He said another well would be drilled at the
spill site to relieve some of the pressure forcing
oil into the sea at the rate of 49,000 gallons an
hour.
Meanwhile, officials were also mapping
plans for cleaning up the slick, estimated at
between two and five miles wide. Hans Bugge,
chief of the Norwegian cleanup operation, said
crews would use special equipment to skim the
oil from the water starting today.
Phillips spokesman Sto Lerdal estimated the
spill as of yesterday at between 1.7 millionand
2.2 million gallons. The largest oil spill on
record was 2.9 million gallons, which poured
from the supertanker Torrey Canyon off south
eastern England in May 1967.
Gov't troops gain in Zaire
Lubudi River, Zaire — Government troops,
moving slowly along roads mined by retreat
ing Katangan rebels, sought yesterday to encir
cle the key railroad junction town of Mut
shatsha.
The town is the main goal of a 10-day-old

Zairean counter-offensive against the Katan
ga ns who invaded from Angola March 8.
Troops advanced cautiously down the same
dusty roads the invaders used in their attack
toward the copper mining town of Kolwezi in
Shaba province, formerly known as Katanga.
An estimated 2000 Katangan exilesareinthe
invasion army. They are led by veterans ot the
late Moise Tshombe's paramilitary police
force, who fled to Angola after the failure of
Tshombe's first attempt in the early 1900s to
severe the mineral-rich province from the rest
of the country.
Fighting erupts in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian troops and tanks
battled radical Palestinian guerrillas for the
second straight day yesterday on the outskirts
of Beirut's Sabra Palestinian refugee camp.
Unofficial reports said at least two persons
were killed in the fighting near Beirut's inter
national airport. But Palestinian sources said
the number of casualties could not be deter
mined immediately because ambulances were
unable to reach the battle area.
In Israel yesterday, a newspaper quoted De
fense Minister Shimon Peres, who has taken
over the duties of prime minister, as saying
Israel would intervene to protect Christian vil
lages in south Lebanon from Palestinian guer
rillas.
The Syrians used Russian-made T54 and
T62 tanks and columns of armored personnel
carriers to lay siege to radical guerrilla stron
gholds at the Sabra camp.
The outbreak of fighting followed the kidnap
of a radical guerrilla leader Thursday and the
slaying oftwoSyrian soldiers Friday, allegedly
by Palestinian radicals.
UN report raps energy concern
New York — Estimates compiled by experts
at a U.N. conference disagree with President
Jimmy Carter's televised warning that "we are
now running out of gas and oil." They hold
that the world probably has enough of both for
another hundred years.
A newly issued summary report of last
summer's conference says the dozens of
specialists who attended generally agreed that

oil and gas from conventional sources "would
last at least until about the time period 2020-
2030."
The summary said the consensus at the con
ference was that, as rising prices make it
economical to tap new sources, "additional
petroleum and gas resources would most prob
ably be available, albeit at a substantially
higher cost . . . during the period of transition
to the use of renewable energy sources, even if
this transition period should last a hundred
years or more."
Governors urge NW oil route
Olympia, Wash. — Governors of several
north-western and north-central states urged
yesterday that the state of Washington become
a transshipment point for Alaskan crude oil to
their landlocked refineries.
The governors' resolution indicated a dis
trust of the Canadian government and propos
als that Alaskan oil be tunneled to the Midwest
through an existing Canadian pipeline.
But the governors said they believed it was
strictly up to Washington state to determine
where an oil port should be located.
Washington Gov. Dixy Lee Ray said adoption
of the resolution did not mean she was ready to
set aside the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s plan to
ship crude from Alaska to Washington and
then via pipelines, including Canadian ones,
to midwestern states.
The governors and representatives of 13
states met behind closed doors all day to dis
cuss the question of shipment of Alaskan oil to
interior U.S. points.
Supplies of Canadian oil to refineries to
those states are being cut off and the refineries
are looking to Washington state as a possible
funnel through which Alaskan oil could flow.

toward the copper mining town of Kolwezi in
Shaba province, formerly known as Katanga.
An estimated 2000 Katangan exilesareinthe

Fighting erupts in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian troops and tanks
battled radical Palestinian guerrillas for the
second straight day yesterday on the outskirts
of Beirut's Sabra Palestinian refugee camp.
Unofficial reports said at least two persons
were killed in the fighting near Beirut's inter
national airport. But Palestinian sources said
the number of casualties could not be deter
mined immediately because ambulances were
unable to reach the battle area.
In Israel yesterday, a newspaper quoted De
fense Minister Shimon Peres, who has taken
over the duties of prime minister, as saying
Israel would intervene to protect Christian vil
lages in south Lebanon from Palestinian guer
rillas.
The Syrians used Russian-made T54 and
T62 tanks and columns of armored personnel
carriers to lay siege to radical guerrilla stron
gholds at the Sabra camp.
The outbreak of fighting followed the kidnap
of a radical guerrilla leader Thursday and the
slaying oftwoSyrian soldiers Friday, allegedly
by Palestinian radicals.
UN report raps energy concern
New York — Estimates compiled by experts
at a U.N. conference disagree with President
Jimmy Carter's televised warning that "we are
now running out of gas and oil." They hold
that the world probably has enough of both for
another hundred years.
A newly issued summary report of last
summer's conference says the dozens of
specialists who attended generally agreed that

oil and gas from conventional sources "would
last at least until about the time period 2020-
2030."
The summary said the consensus at the con
ference was that, as rising prices make it
economical to tap new sources, "additional
petroleum and gas resources would most prob
ably be available, albeit at a substantially
higher cost . . . during the period of transition
to the use of renewable energy sources, even if
this transition period should last a hundred
years or more."
Governors urge NW oil route
Olympia, Wash. — Governors of several
north-western and north-central states urged
yesterday that the state of Washington become
a transshipment point for Alaskan crude oil to
their landlocked refineries.
The governors' resolution indicated a dis
trust of the Canadian government and propos
als that Alaskan oil be tunneled to the Midwest
through an existing Canadian pipeline.
But the governors said they believed it was
strictly up to Washington state to determine
where an oil port should be located.
Washington Gov. Dixy Lee Ray said adoption
of the resolution did not mean she was ready to
set aside the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s plan to
ship crude from Alaska to Washington and
then via pipelines, including Canadian ones,
to midwestern states.
The governors and representatives of 13
states met behind closed doors all day to dis
cuss the question of shipment of Alaskan oil to
interior U.S. points.
Supplies of Canadian oil to refineries to
those states are being cut off and the refineries
are looking to Washington state as a possible
funnel through which Alaskan oil could flow.
Dirty air might prevent coal use
Washington — Some areas with severe air
pollution problems, such as California and
New York City, might be exempted from man
datory conversion to coal under President Car
ter's new energy program. White House energy
adviser James Schlesinger said yesterday.
"There will probably be some parts of the
country where we will be unable to burn coal,"

Schlesinger said.
He made his remarks on the CBS television
program Face The Nation.
Schlesinger said the goal to achieve one bill
ion tons of coal production by 1985 probably
will not mean a lessening of environmental
standards.
"We are attempting to avoid any rollback of
environmental protection," he said. "But some
states have unique problems. Air pollution is a
far more serious problem in California than it is
elsewhere."
Experts see lower farm prices
Sacramento — Two economists said yester
day the drought will probably be less costly
than has been predicted.
Eric Thor was quoted by The Sacramento
Bee as saying the price of fresh vegetables may
rise in late summer and early fall, but he
doesn't see any major price increases for other
crops. He had earlier predicted higher costs for
rice, beef, fruit and other products.
He now says fruits and vegetables for can
ning will be in ample supply.
Although Thor said beef prices may rise late
in the year, "that's not due just to the present
drought. It's due to a couple of years of drought
and it's due to drought in other areas of the
country."
He added that dairy farmers are paying more
for feed, but this doesn't mean the state De
partment of Food and Agriculture will permit
boosts in milk prices.
Pauline Sweezey, chief economist for the
state Department of Finance, said the drought
loss, even in farm income, should be only
about half the most recent estimate of the De
partment of Food and Agriculture.
Sweezey estimates farm income to drop
about $500 million, or five per cent. She said a
preliminary study shows there might not be
large impact on the state as a whole.
The most recent estimate of the Department
of Food and Agriculture puts the loss at bet
ween $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.
Brown criticizes ecoiogists
San Francisco — Covernor Edmund Brown
Jr. voiced criticism of environmental lobbyists

in a newspaper interview yesterday, saying
Californians concerned with the state's ecolog
ical health were not being well represented.
In an interview with the San Francisco
Examiner. Brown said the lobbyists "seem to
be losing their effectiveness."
In the wide-ranging talk, Brown also had
some harsh words for San Francisco school
officials whom he said lacked initiative. And
he shrugged off suggestions he was making a
second run for the presidency.
Brown reiterated a promise to veto any bill
that increases local taxes in the face of court
mandated school financing reforms.
Brown said he supported the school finance
reform bill introduced by Assemblyman Leroy
Greene (D-Sacramento) that was offered up in
the wake of the Serrano decision by the
California Supreme Court.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy through today with chance of

Experts to cap North Sea oil spill
Stavanger, Norway — American experts
will try today to cap a runaway oil well that has
been spewing millions of gallons of crude oil
into the North Sea.
Norwegian authorities said yesterday the
12-mile-long slick flowing from the offshore
well had begun to dissipate and was turning
away from the coasts of Norway and Denmark.
The Phillips Petroleum Co. said the decision
to seal off the leak at drilling platform "Bravo"
was made yesterday after specialists from a
Houston, Tex., company were set down by
helicopter on the oil-covered midsea rig.
Phillips said they found that the rig had es
caped damage when a pipe exploded Friday
night, setting off a 180-foot-high geyser of oil
that spilled into the surrounding sea.
The specialists, Boots Hansen and Richard
Hattenberg of the Red Adair Oil Well Fire and
Blowout Prevention Co., reported the blowout
was partial and that an underwater safety valve
was keeping some of the oil from spilling.
A Phillips spokesman estimated the capping
operation would take one to three days, de
pending on weather conditions.
He said another well would be drilled at the
spill site to relieve some of the pressure forcing
oil into the sea at the rate of 49,000 gallons an
hour.
Meanwhile, officials were also mapping
plans for cleaning up the slick, estimated at
between two and five miles wide. Hans Bugge,
chief of the Norwegian cleanup operation, said
crews would use special equipment to skim the
oil from the water starting today.
Phillips spokesman Sto Lerdal estimated the
spill as of yesterday at between 1.7 millionand
2.2 million gallons. The largest oil spill on
record was 2.9 million gallons, which poured
from the supertanker Torrey Canyon off south
eastern England in May 1967.
Gov't troops gain in Zaire
Lubudi River, Zaire — Government troops,

Jr. voiced criticism of environmental lobbyists

in a newspaper interview yesterday, saying
Californians concerned with the state's ecolog
ical health were not being well represented.
In an interview with the San Francisco
Examiner. Brown said the lobbyists "seem to
be losing their effectiveness."
In the wide-ranging talk, Brown also had
some harsh words for San Francisco school
officials whom he said lacked initiative. And
he shrugged off suggestions he was making a
second run for the presidency.
Brown reiterated a promise to veto any bill
that increases local taxes in the face of court
mandated school financing reforms.
Brown said he supported the school finance
reform bill introduced by Assemblyman Leroy
Greene (D-Sacramento) that was offered up in
the wake of the Serrano decision by the
California Supreme Court.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy through today with chance of
sprinkles or light showers. Patches of fog or
low clouds along the coast nights and morn
ings. Clearing tomorrow. Slightly cooler days.

and tomorrow in the 60s and low 70s.
Experts to cap North Sea oil spill
Stavanger, Norway — American experts
will try today to cap a runaway oil well that has
been spewing millions of gallons of crude oil
into the North Sea.
Norwegian authorities said yesterday the
12-mile-long slick flowing from the offshore
well had begun to dissipate and was turning
away from the coasts of Norway and Denmark.
The Phillips Petroleum Co. said the decision
to seal off the leak at drilling platform "Bravo"
was made yesterday after specialists from a
Houston, Tex., company were set down by
helicopter on the oil-covered midsea rig.
Phillips said they found that the rig had es
caped damage when a pipe exploded Friday
night, setting off a 180-foot-high geyser of oil
that spilled into the surrounding sea.
The specialists, Boots Hansen and Richard
Hattenberg of the Red Adair Oil Well Fire and
Blowout Prevention Co., reported the blowout
was partial and that an underwater safety valve
was keeping some of the oil from spilling.
A Phillips spokesman estimated the capping
operation would take one to three days, de
pending on weather conditions.
He said another well would be drilled at the
spill site to relieve some of the pressure forcing
oil into the sea at the rate of 49,000 gallons an
hour.
Meanwhile, officials were also mapping
plans for cleaning up the slick, estimated at
between two and five miles wide. Hans Bugge,
chief of the Norwegian cleanup operation, said
crews would use special equipment to skim the
oil from the water starting today.
Phillips spokesman Sto Lerdal estimated the
spill as of yesterday at between 1.7 millionand
2.2 million gallons. The largest oil spill on
record was 2.9 million gallons, which poured
from the supertanker Torrey Canyon off south
eastern England in May 1967.
Gov't troops gain in Zaire
Lubudi River, Zaire — Government troops,
moving slowly along roads mined by retreat
ing Katangan rebels, sought yesterday to encir
cle the key railroad junction town of Mut
shatsha.
The town is the main goal of a 10-day-old

Zairean counter-offensive against the Katan
ga ns who invaded from Angola March 8.
Troops advanced cautiously down the same
dusty roads the invaders used in their attack
toward the copper mining town of Kolwezi in
Shaba province, formerly known as Katanga.
An estimated 2000 Katangan exilesareinthe
invasion army. They are led by veterans ot the
late Moise Tshombe's paramilitary police
force, who fled to Angola after the failure of
Tshombe's first attempt in the early 1900s to
severe the mineral-rich province from the rest
of the country.
Fighting erupts in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian troops and tanks
battled radical Palestinian guerrillas for the
second straight day yesterday on the outskirts
of Beirut's Sabra Palestinian refugee camp.
Unofficial reports said at least two persons
were killed in the fighting near Beirut's inter
national airport. But Palestinian sources said
the number of casualties could not be deter
mined immediately because ambulances were
unable to reach the battle area.
In Israel yesterday, a newspaper quoted De
fense Minister Shimon Peres, who has taken
over the duties of prime minister, as saying
Israel would intervene to protect Christian vil
lages in south Lebanon from Palestinian guer
rillas.
The Syrians used Russian-made T54 and
T62 tanks and columns of armored personnel
carriers to lay siege to radical guerrilla stron
gholds at the Sabra camp.
The outbreak of fighting followed the kidnap
of a radical guerrilla leader Thursday and the
slaying oftwoSyrian soldiers Friday, allegedly
by Palestinian radicals.
UN report raps energy concern
New York — Estimates compiled by experts
at a U.N. conference disagree with President
Jimmy Carter's televised warning that "we are
now running out of gas and oil." They hold
that the world probably has enough of both for
another hundred years.
A newly issued summary report of last
summer's conference says the dozens of
specialists who attended generally agreed that

oil and gas from conventional sources "would
last at least until about the time period 2020-
2030."
The summary said the consensus at the con
ference was that, as rising prices make it
economical to tap new sources, "additional
petroleum and gas resources would most prob
ably be available, albeit at a substantially
higher cost . . . during the period of transition
to the use of renewable energy sources, even if
this transition period should last a hundred
years or more."
Governors urge NW oil route
Olympia, Wash. — Governors of several
north-western and north-central states urged
yesterday that the state of Washington become
a transshipment point for Alaskan crude oil to
their landlocked refineries.
The governors' resolution indicated a dis
trust of the Canadian government and propos
als that Alaskan oil be tunneled to the Midwest
through an existing Canadian pipeline.
But the governors said they believed it was
strictly up to Washington state to determine
where an oil port should be located.
Washington Gov. Dixy Lee Ray said adoption
of the resolution did not mean she was ready to
set aside the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s plan to
ship crude from Alaska to Washington and
then via pipelines, including Canadian ones,
to midwestern states.
The governors and representatives of 13
states met behind closed doors all day to dis
cuss the question of shipment of Alaskan oil to
interior U.S. points.
Supplies of Canadian oil to refineries to
those states are being cut off and the refineries
are looking to Washington state as a possible
funnel through which Alaskan oil could flow.
Dirty air might prevent coal use
Washington — Some areas with severe air
pollution problems, such as California and
New York City, might be exempted from man
datory conversion to coal under President Car
ter's new energy program. White House energy
adviser James Schlesinger said yesterday.
"There will probably be some parts of the
country where we will be unable to burn coal,"

Schlesinger said.
He made his remarks on the CBS television
program Face The Nation.
Schlesinger said the goal to achieve one bill
ion tons of coal production by 1985 probably
will not mean a lessening of environmental
standards.
"We are attempting to avoid any rollback of
environmental protection," he said. "But some
states have unique problems. Air pollution is a
far more serious problem in California than it is
elsewhere."
Experts see lower farm prices
Sacramento — Two economists said yester
day the drought will probably be less costly
than has been predicted.
Eric Thor was quoted by The Sacramento
Bee as saying the price of fresh vegetables may
rise in late summer and early fall, but he
doesn't see any major price increases for other
crops. He had earlier predicted higher costs for
rice, beef, fruit and other products.
He now says fruits and vegetables for can
ning will be in ample supply.
Although Thor said beef prices may rise late
in the year, "that's not due just to the present
drought. It's due to a couple of years of drought
and it's due to drought in other areas of the
country."
He added that dairy farmers are paying more
for feed, but this doesn't mean the state De
partment of Food and Agriculture will permit
boosts in milk prices.
Pauline Sweezey, chief economist for the
state Department of Finance, said the drought
loss, even in farm income, should be only
about half the most recent estimate of the De
partment of Food and Agriculture.
Sweezey estimates farm income to drop
about $500 million, or five per cent. She said a
preliminary study shows there might not be
large impact on the state as a whole.
The most recent estimate of the Department
of Food and Agriculture puts the loss at bet
ween $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.
