# IRS taxes federal grad grant

Graduate and postgraduate students
who receive grants under the National
Research Service Award (NRSA) prog
ram will now have to pay income tax
on the money received, according to a
ruling by the Internal Revenue Ser
vice.
Normally, all financial support aid
to graduate students is tax-free. The
NRSA grants are the only ones affected
by the IRS ruling.
According to Sponsored Projects Of
ficer D-Ann Downey, the ruling by the
IRS was made because it feels that re
cipients of the awards must perform
work in order to receive funds.
But Downey stated the University
takes the view that work is not being
performed. She said that these stu
dents are in training, and quite fre
quently classes are required.
The Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare (HEW) which is re
sponsible for the NRSA program, is
appealing the decision.
But HEW and the University both
contend that the final responsibility
for paying the taxes and fighting the
decision rests with the recipients of
the funds.
NRSA money is awarded for re
search in the health sciences and af
fects approximately 250 graduate stu
dents and 210 post-graduate students,

according to Maurine Buma in the
Controller's Office.
Buma said the University will com
ply for 1977, which means the Univer
sity will send out 1099 forms for all
recipients of NRSA grants.
She pointed out that this most af
fects graduate students who have not
had to file any tax returns in the past.
IRS 1099 forms have always been filed
for post-graduate researchers since
only $3600 per year in research grants
is tax deductable.
Downey said she is advising all
graduate students affected to file in
come tax returns, even if the NRSA
money was their only source of in
come, stating they believe the money
they receive from HEW is non-taxable.
Graduate students normally receive
$3900 per year plus tuition benefits,
according to Downey.
The real danger, said Downey, is
that people who must file, may not file
at all.
Downey also said that because the
IRS made the ruling so late in fiscal
1976, she does not see how it can hold
students responsible for paying taxes
on this income earned last year.
Downey and Buma both said the first
time they heard of the ruling was dur
ing the second week of March, even
though a letter advising institutions
was sent out by HEW on Jan. 28, 1977.

Downey also said she is sending a
memo to all students, research fellows
and supervisors in NRSA programs
explaining what has happened.
She said that she found out about the
IRS ruling through a student, and has
never been formally notified by the
IRS.
"To me, they are at fault for not
notifying anyone," said Downey.
Buma said that even if the IRS deci
sion is upheld, the University is not
under any obligation to withhold
funds for taxes from the NRSA grants
because no employe-employer rela
tionship exists.
