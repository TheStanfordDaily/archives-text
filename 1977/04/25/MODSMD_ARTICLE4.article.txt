Islamabad, Pakistan (AP) — The
government jailed 48 leading opposi
tion politicians yesterday in a coun
teroffensive against a six-week-old
campaign of street protests against
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Most leaders of the opposition coali
tion, the Pakistan National Alliance
(PNA), are already in jail, and the new
wave of arrests included acting PNA
chief Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan and
other second-echelon leaders in major
cities.
The PNA promptly announced that
Pir Pagaro, a bearded political leader
from southern Sind province, had
been named its new acting head.
It also called for a march on the Na
tional Assembly next Saturday in this
capital city to press its demands for
Bhutto's ouster and the resignation of
other officeholders. The march ini
tially was set for tomorrow, the day the
assembly opens a 15-day session.
Boycott
ThePNA is boycotting theassembly,
charging that Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party (PPP) rigged the March
7 elections to gain a two-thirds major
ity in the assembly.
No major violence was reported yes
terday.
Almost 200 persons have been killed
in clashes between rival political
groups and security forces since the
elections.
Opposition sources said Nasrullah
Khan was planning to meet with army
generals in Islamabad as the head of a
three-man PNA delegation when he
was arrested. The army has intervened
in some past Pakistani political crises,
and the PNA has asked the military not
to follow Bhutto's orders.
Others arrested included Jan
Mohammed Abbasi, Syed Mohammed
Zafar, Wazir Ali, Ihsan Elahi Zaheer
and Begum Nasim Wali Khan, a
woman PNA leader.
'Unconstitutional'
In Lahore, an elder opposition
leader. Maulana Abul Aala Maudoodi,
charged that the martial law imposed
on Karachi, Lahore and Hyderabad
Friday was "unconstitutional and il
legal."

"It is quite evident that at least 95
per cent of the population is against
Mr. Bhutto and his unrepresentative
government," said Maudoodi, one of
the few opposition leaders not in jail.
"This also means the national army is
being used against the nation to keep
an unpopular government in power."
He said antigovernment demonstra
tions must continue, even under the
martial law.
In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and
Islamabad, the PNA mounted a pro
cession to protest the killing of one of
its supporters by PPP men on Friday.
After the march, Maulana Fateh
Mohammd, a PNA leader, told a crowd
of 5000 they should carry on with the
anti-Bhutto campaign. He also urged
people to stop buying newspapers to
protest the censorship imposed on
domestic reports of the antigovern
ment demonstrations.

per cent of the population is against
Mr. Bhutto and his unrepresentative
government," said Maudoodi, one of

an unpopular government in power."

Islamabad, the PNA mounted a pro

from southern Sind province, had
been named its new acting head.
