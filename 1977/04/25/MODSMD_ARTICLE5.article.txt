# 'Sao Paulo needs decentralization'
## 
### 
Planning and governing in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, should be decentralized
to encourage social change and effi
ciency, according to Jorge VVilheim,
secretary of economy and planning of
the state of Sao Paulo.
Wilheim also said substantial
changes in the legal and taxation sys
tems would be needed to improve the
quality of life for the residents of Sao
Paulo.
Wilheim participated in a three-day
conference here this weekend in
which scholars and government offi
cials from England, Brazil and the Un
ited States met to discuss the problems
of urban development in Manchester,
England and Sao Paulo.
In a speech Thursday entitled "Is
Sao Paulo Governable?", Wilheim said
centralized decisions are currently
popular in many authoritarian gov
ernments.
He said technocrats in many of these
countries have produced "centralized
decisions, power and frequently mis
takes whose seriousness is propor
tionate to the power that has caused
them."
In an interview, Wilheim said con
sultation with regional heads "has
pedgagogical meaning. Participation
is a way of diminishing risks of cen
tralized decisions."
He said several new concepts and
institutional changes would have to be
undertaken to "adjust a democratic life
to the country's structural
peculiarities."
He defined "democratic life" as "the
best and fairest people's representa
tion one can achieve in order to induce

and support political decisions that re
flect public interest."
He said some of Sao Paulo's topical
problems could be improved by reor
ganizing the national budget.
"Taxes on unoccupied urban land
that are being retained for speculation
should be selectively raised," he said,
adding that landownership rights
should be separated from building
rights.
Wilheim noted the importance of
comparing the problems of the two
cities focused on in the conference. He
said many problems in Brazil could be
better solved through a historical
study of the urban development in
Manchester.
