Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (AP) â€”
Ethiopia's leftist military rulers an
nounced yesterday they had closed the
consulates of the United States and
five other countries in war-torn Eritrea
province.
The order came a day after the gov
ernment closed down four other U.S.
facilities in Ethiopia, saying they con
tradicted the ideology of the Ethiopian
socialist revolution.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said
the U.S., Italian and Sudanese consu
lates and the honorary consulates of
Belgium, France and Britain in Eritrea,
Ethiopia's northernmost province,
were closed effective Saturday.
Consular officials were given four
days to leave the country. Neither
order affected the U.S. Embassy here.
No reason
No reason was immediately given
for shutting down the consulates.
Guerrillas of the Eritrean Liberation
Front (ELF), who have been fighting
for 16 years to win independence for
Eritrea, claimed earlier this month
they were closing in on Asmara, the
Eritrean capital, and would "liberate"
the province this year.
About 100 American staff members
and 200 dependents, including 46 of
ficers assigned to the military advisory
program, were affected by the expul
sion order, which reportedly was con
veyed to the U.S. Embassy only a few
hours before it was made public.
The closings followed an escalation
in anti-American and anti-Sudanese
statements over the past week by the
increasingly pro-Soviet military coun
cil, which rules the country under the
leadership of Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile
Mariam.

President Jaafar el-Numairy of
neighboring Sudan has openly aided
the ELF' rebels.
Aid halted
The Carter administration halted $6
million in military assistance to
Ethiopia in February because of al
leged violations of human rights.
Under the late Emperor Haile Selassie,
Ethiopia had been entirely dependent
on the United States for its military
equipment.
Meanwhile in Washington, the State
Department protested the short period
the Ethiopian government is allowing
for closing the facilities. But U.S.
spokesmen said that the United States
had been planning to phase out the
obsolete kagnew station and to cut the
military mission in half.
There also has been persistent
speculation in Addis Ababa that the
30-month-old military government
was preparing to reduce the U.S. pre
sence in Ethiopia as part of its move
away from the West and toward Mos
cow.
Since Carter halted military aid to
Ethiopia, it has reportedly taken deliv
ery of 31 T34 tanks, 40 armored per
sonnel carriers and six antiaircraft
guns from the Soviet Union.
Weapons use
Observers in neighboring Kenya be
lieved the weapons might be destined
for use against the ELF. Eritrea, on the
Red Sea, is Ethiopia's only outlet to the
sea and Mengistu has repeatedly said
the government will never let it sec
ede.
Eritrea, a former Italian colony, was
federated with the Addis Ababa gov
ernment in 1952 and integrated into
Ethiopia in 1962.
The military regime is also struggl
ing against guerrilas of the rightist
Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU)
and scattered armed resistance in at
least seven of the nation's 14 pro
vinces.
Gun battles between opponents and
supporters of the government are a
regular occurrence in Addis Ababa
and other Ethiopian towns.
The leftist military officers came to
power in a gradual takeover that began
in February 1974. Emperor Haile
Selassie was deposed on Sept. 12,1974
and in November of that year 60 politi
cal prisoners were executed.
The secretive military council has
been wracked by internal upheavals
ever since.
Mengistu consolidated his position
as the military strongman in early Feb
ruary following a wave of violence that
left 11 persons dead. Major targets of
the government attack were the leftist
Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary
Army and the rightwing EDU.
