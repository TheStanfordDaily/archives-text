# Yell leader try outs to start on Thursday
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
The ball rests on the visitor's 19-
yard line late in the fourth quarter and
the Cardinals, trailing by three, have
fourth and a long yard to go for a first
down.
Sensing that the crowd won't be
satisfied with a tie, yell leaders soon
have the entire stadium thundering
out its wishes.
GO, GO, GO
Although one can only guess what
the coach chose to do in this fictional
gridiron battle, the word is "GO" for
yell leaders here on the Farm.
A search for five innovative and

energetic yell leaders begins Thursday
with an organizational meeting at
noon in Maples Pavilion, a student
alumni committee pushing the yell
leader resurrection decided Friday.
Reporting mixed student body input
of apprehensive skepticism and
guarded optimism, the committee ag
reed to continue with plans to hold a
campus-wide tryout and selection of
yell leaders.
The purpose of the short meeting
Thursday is to explain selection
criteria to potential yell leaders and to
schedule individual interviews and
tryouts. Tryouts are open to all under
graduates.
Interviews of prospective Krazy
Georges (or Krazy Georgettes) by a
six-member panel begin next Monday.
Representatives from the Band, Dol
lies, Athletic Department, ASSU,
Inter-Fraternity Council and KZSU
make up the interview committee.
Tryouts will be held the following
week either indoors in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium or Maples Pavilion or
outdoors in White Plaza or the field
next to Florence Moore.
Each person trying out will be re
quired to lead an individual interpre
tation of the Axe Yell. In addition, yell
leader candidates will have a chance to
do any other yell or routine they de
sire.
A panel of 50 to 100 students, staff
and alumni will judge the tryouts.
Final selection will be based on inter
views and tryouts.
Any student or staff member want
ing to help judge the tryouts should
contact Gary Gavalli, sports informa
tion director, at the Athletic Depart
ment.
Next year's yell leaders will travel to
certain away football and basketball
games with the cost of travel and inci
dentals underwritten by the Athletic
Department.
