# Stanford Daily Opinions
## COP term worthwhile 
### 
On a number of occasions re
cently, I've been asked whether
my experience on the ASSU
Council of Presidents has been a
good one. After all, what the hell
has a superannuated graduate
student to gain from playing in
the sandbox with the rest of the
"kindergarten contingent"?
A great deal, actually. How
better to learn about an institu
tion and its functioning ihan to
roll up one's sleeves and become
involved in attempts to improve
it?
For an aspiring university pro-

fessor — or indeed for a prospec
tive member of any organization
— there are volumes in such ex
perience whose largest lessons
will never be written; they are
not really translatable. There is
much to be said for the "doing."
But the ASSU can offer a par
ticularly fascinating, though at
times incredibly exasperating,
educational perspective. Those
who choose to can learn and ac
complish much, though the con
sequences of one's efforts are
seldom externally visible or in
ternally satisfying in any im

mediate sense. But dealing with
the experience — and experi
ence with the dealing — is in
valuable.
Those who only see the
sandbox miss the point entirely.
The ASSU is admittedly beset
with serious problems, and is so
distant right now from what it
could and should be, that the
prevalent cynicism is certainly
understandable.
The failure of vision lies in not
grasping the underlying struc
tural causes of the ASSU's cur
rent ineffectiveness and of the

students' widespread alienation
from their association. The de
sperate need for reform, espe
cially in the absence of alterna
tive structural prototypes, calls
for a perspective so broad
reaching that the immediate
prospects for viable student gov
ernment at Stanford are not en
couraging. The needed overhaul
is truly monumental.
The more general point,
though, is that end results are
never the whole story. Just as
education does not really mean
learning transient facts and

theories, in the same sense that
success at enjoying life has very
little to do with externally visi
ble accomplishments, commun
ity involvement is not best done
for either self-serving or "altruis
tic" purposes.
The primary benefits of par
ticipation in one's social envi
ronment, whatever the particu
lar milieu, are educational and
personal, to my view.
After all, what learning ex
perience is ultimately more val
uable (or rewarding) than that of
developing a more realistic
awareness of what you can ex
pect to achieve, and how best to
go about doing so (and enjoying
it) in various circumstances? De
spite its passing frustrations, the
office thus offers its holders a
rare if not unique perspective.
To return to the original ques
tion: has my year on the COP
been worthwhile? Absolutely
and without question. But
would 1 do it again? Not on your
life! After a year, the experience
begins to wear.
The ASSU is in capable hands,
which I am sure will be seldom
empty! Let us give our new
Council of Presidents whatever
support we can, and as much
(hopefully constructive) criti
cism as they deserve, during the
coming year.
They have their work cut out
for them.

The ASSU is admittedly beset
with serious problems, and is so
distant right now from what it
could and should be, that the
prevalent cynicism is certainly
understandable.
The failure of vision lies in not
grasping the underlying struc
tural causes of the ASSU's cur
rent ineffectiveness and of the

students' widespread alienation
from their association. The de
sperate need for reform, espe
cially in the absence of alterna
tive structural prototypes, calls
for a perspective so broad
reaching that the immediate
prospects for viable student gov
ernment at Stanford are not en
couraging. The needed overhaul
is truly monumental.
The more general point,
though, is that end results are
never the whole story. Just as
education does not really mean
learning transient facts and

theories, in the same sense that
success at enjoying life has very
little to do with externally visi
ble accomplishments, commun
ity involvement is not best done
for either self-serving or "altruis
tic" purposes.
The primary benefits of par
ticipation in one's social envi
ronment, whatever the particu
lar milieu, are educational and
personal, to my view.
After all, what learning ex
perience is ultimately more val
uable (or rewarding) than that of
developing a more realistic
awareness of what you can ex
pect to achieve, and how best to
go about doing so (and enjoying
it) in various circumstances? De
spite its passing frustrations, the
office thus offers its holders a
rare if not unique perspective.
To return to the original ques
tion: has my year on the COP
been worthwhile? Absolutely
and without question. But
would 1 do it again? Not on your
life! After a year, the experience
begins to wear.
The ASSU is in capable hands,
which I am sure will be seldom
empty! Let us give our new
Council of Presidents whatever
support we can, and as much
(hopefully constructive) criti
cism as they deserve, during the
coming year.
They have their work cut out
for them.

On a number of occasions re
cently, I've been asked whether
my experience on the ASSU
Council of Presidents has been a
good one. After all, what the hell
has a superannuated graduate
student to gain from playing in
the sandbox with the rest of the
"kindergarten contingent"?
A great deal, actually. How
better to learn about an institu
tion and its functioning ihan to
roll up one's sleeves and become
involved in attempts to improve
it?
For an aspiring university pro-

fessor — or indeed for a prospec
tive member of any organization
— there are volumes in such ex
perience whose largest lessons
will never be written; they are
not really translatable. There is
much to be said for the "doing."
But the ASSU can offer a par
ticularly fascinating, though at
times incredibly exasperating,
educational perspective. Those
who choose to can learn and ac
complish much, though the con
sequences of one's efforts are
seldom externally visible or in
ternally satisfying in any im

mediate sense. But dealing with
the experience — and experi
ence with the dealing — is in
valuable.
Those who only see the
sandbox miss the point entirely.
