# Group lobbying brings results
## 
### Mike Charison 
The University pays approxi
mately $22,000 each year to belong
to groups which lobby higher edu
cation viewpoints to Congress and
the state government, according to
Robert Freelen, director of govern
ment relations.
Handing together with institu
tions having similar concerns en
hances the power of all members to
promote their viewpoint, I'reelen
said.
And in recent years these groups
have become more effective, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president of public affairs.
On the national level, the Univer
sity makes its views known through
organizations such as the National
Association of Independent Col
leges and Universities (NAICU), the
Association of American Univer
sities (AAU), the Council for Ad
vancement and Support of Educa
tion (CASE) and the American
Council on Education (ACE).
In California, the University uses
the services of the Association of
Independent California Colleges
and Universities (AICCU) and
AICCU lobbyist Jonathan Brown.
Nothing new
According to Rosenzweig, mem
bership in organizations such as
these is nothing new. Most of the
time, any University input on prop

used legislation is in the form ot
lobbying through these groups.
In special cases, the University
presents testimony before a com
mittee on a bill. However, Univer
sity people who testify, said
Rosenzweig, "usually testify in
their capacity as experts rather than
as representatives of the Univer
sity."
The University presently has no
registered lobbyists with Congress
or the state legislature, according to
the Congressional Record and the
State Office of Political Reform.
In 1970, the University engaged a
law firm in Washington D.C.. to
represent the University before the
Senate on a proposed bill which
would have required institutions to
reveal the names of students con
victed of campus disruption, ac
cording to Rosenzweig. But, "that
was a one-time thing," he said.
Travel
Rosenzweig and Kreelen, how
ever, occasionally travel to
Washington, where they meet with
government officials and try to find
out "what's going on and see how
our interests might be affected,"
said Rosenzweig.
Freelen said one of his main
duties is to keep a close eye on legis
lation introduced before the various
legislative bodies.
If a bill contains provisions

which affect theUniversity, Freelen
said, he sends a copy of the prop
osal to the appropriate department
ol theUniversity toran analysis, re
questing that tfi«* department let
him know il it is something his of
fice should explore further.
If it is an important issue, he will
look into the bill further and check
with CASE, NAICl and other or
ganizations to determine what they
plan to do about it.
In extreme cases, he said, the
University will get involved in a
lobbying process directly. This
more often occurs on the state level,
he said.
Land reform hill
An example is a land reform bill
which was introduced in the state
assembly last session. The bill
would have required that all ag
ricultural land presently existing
remain agricultural. The University
holds some 8000 acres of land,
much of it presently in this categ
ory. In this case, the University lob
bied to have an amendment intro
duced which would exempt educa
tional institutions.
"When someone drafts a bill,
there is no way to anticipate all the
consequences of that bill," Freelen
said. "So the major job we have is to

there are occasionally uninten-

Freelen said membership in all of
the national organizations except
AAU cost about $1001) per year
while AAU membership costs
$4500. Membership in ATCCU was
considerably more: $15,000 to
$16,000 per year. He said AICCU
membership costs more because
there are fewer members and be
cause dues are based on enrollment
and endowment.
"That may seem somewhat dis
proportionate," he said, "but over
1000 Stanford students are winners
of California state scholarships and
that means about $2 million each
year.
"The principal focus of AICCU is
to monitor that program. It's an
enormous benefit to the private in
stitutions in the state," Freelen
said.
Freelen said the University does
not lobby government agencies for
funding research proposals.

to monitor that program. It's an
enormous benefit to the private in

have become more effective, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president of public affairs.
On the national level, the Univer
sity makes its views known through
organizations such as the National
Association of Independent Col
leges and Universities (NAICU), the
Association of American Univer
sities (AAU), the Council for Ad
vancement and Support of Educa
tion (CASE) and the American
Council on Education (ACE).
In California, the University uses
the services of the Association of
Independent California Colleges
and Universities (AICCU) and
AICCU lobbyist Jonathan Brown.
Nothing new
According to Rosenzweig, mem
bership in organizations such as
these is nothing new. Most of the
time, any University input on prop

used legislation is in the form ot
lobbying through these groups.
In special cases, the University
presents testimony before a com
mittee on a bill. However, Univer
sity people who testify, said
Rosenzweig, "usually testify in
their capacity as experts rather than
as representatives of the Univer
sity."
The University presently has no
registered lobbyists with Congress
or the state legislature, according to
the Congressional Record and the
State Office of Political Reform.
In 1970, the University engaged a
law firm in Washington D.C.. to
represent the University before the
Senate on a proposed bill which
would have required institutions to
reveal the names of students con
victed of campus disruption, ac
cording to Rosenzweig. But, "that
was a one-time thing," he said.
Travel
Rosenzweig and Kreelen, how
ever, occasionally travel to
Washington, where they meet with
government officials and try to find
out "what's going on and see how
our interests might be affected,"
said Rosenzweig.
Freelen said one of his main
duties is to keep a close eye on legis
lation introduced before the various
legislative bodies.
If a bill contains provisions

which affect theUniversity, Freelen
said, he sends a copy of the prop
osal to the appropriate department
ol theUniversity toran analysis, re
questing that tfi«* department let
him know il it is something his of
fice should explore further.
If it is an important issue, he will
look into the bill further and check
with CASE, NAICl and other or
ganizations to determine what they
plan to do about it.
In extreme cases, he said, the
University will get involved in a
lobbying process directly. This
more often occurs on the state level,
he said.
