# Malaise of Stanford's spring
## 
### 
In some ways, the current state
of things around here lends itself
to an ambivalence of mood over
the course of Stanford and of our
own lives.
Perhaps the weather is setting
the tone. By traditional Califor
nia standards, this last month
has been a gem â€” the sunniest
and warmest of any of the four
springs I've spent here.
And yet like the bank account
of even the wealthiest of us, our
sunshine is a resource that can
not forever be drawn upon with
out depositing our due.
The impending horror of
drought causes each bright, clear
day to lose some of its cheer.
Aside from the impoverishment
of lives which this calamity
would bring, there is the more
immediate, trivial lament that
Stanford itself doesn't look so
good dressed in brown.
Likewise, recent events on
campus can elicit some mixed
feelings.
Uplift
Koran untempered uplift, one
need only look at a couple of
grand-scale voluntary efforts:
the first Stanford Trivia Bowl
and tho Ram's Head production
of Fiddler on the Roof.
Juniors Bob Moog and Andy
Baker, not content with comp
laining, as many of us do, about
the grim seriousness with which
so many approach their Stanford
days, put together a trivia com
petition that provided a few
laughs to all who took part.
Particularly for us first-round
losers, the Trivia Bowl was only
a momentary hiatus between
classes. For Moog and Baker, it
was the product of hours of pre
paration and unpaid effort to en
rich the Stanford community.
Fiddler on the Roof was all of
that, on a grander scale. As an
old high school thespian, aware

of the sweat and tears that go into
the most banal of three-act com
edies, I can only marvel at the
production of a 3V2-hour quality
musical by students on bor
rowed time.
And at that, Fiddler was but a
paragon for the countless dorm
plays and other cultural produc-

tions put on by students as
sideshows of their talents.
Events such as these cause one to
regret that for so many students,
Stanford consists of their classes
and the library.
Second thoughts
Other student efforts bring on
a few second thoughts, however.
Political causes, and the ac
tivists who lead movements for
them, are a mainstay of the col
lege campus. On a more serious
level, they contribute to our lives
just as do the cultural stagings,
exposing us to points of view
that exist outside mainstream
academia.
Seemingly forever, college
communities have benefitted
from activists who promulgate
their ideas through the campus
press and organize or attend
meetings of the "concerned."
More recently, a new dimen
sion, that of the protest demonst
ration and occasional confronta
tion, has been added to the ac
tivist's repertoire. One is temp
ted to encourage those who give
action to their beliefs, often at

the risk of being razzed by an
offended majority, and at the
same time to bemoan the relative
ideological slumber of the Stan
ford campus.
Showdown
But the recent showdown at
the Placement Center can't help
but remind us of the tumult of
the early '70s and cause us to
wonder whether the bookish
ness of today's students might
really result in Stanford being a
more reasoned place now than it
was then.
The insistence of campus ac
tivists that Stanford apply moral
considerations to its investment
and recruiting policies seems at
first a very laudable proposition.
The problem with the applica
tion of moral criteria to institu
tional policy is that few moral
judgments are uniformly shared.
This fact becomes clear when
any particular group of moralists
seeks to convey its righteousness
by enforcing it on the commun
ity-
Such was the case at the CPPC
when a group of protesters
banded together to prevent
physically the entrance of a
Marine recruiter whom the rules
of the institution permitted.
Precisely at the commission of
that act of force (and it is silly to
deny that it was anything but

that), the effort of the protesters
ceased to be an intellectual one.
The group effectively decreed it
self possessed of a superior mor
ality and empowered to enforce
that morality on all.
Prescribing policies
Though 1 tend to agree with
the demonstrators' stance on
military recruiting, I've never
felt that my moral beliefs allow
me to prescribe unilaterally the
policies of an institution with
which 1 voluntarily associated
myself.
It is a sad fact that among those
who have wished to change
human behavior through his
tory, force has usually been fal
len back upon when ideas have
failed. In this regard, it is no cre
dit to the protesters that in the
aftermath of their blockade, they
tried to ignore or shout down the
few who sought to challenge
their beliefs.
If what we saw at the CPPC is a
return to the bullying of the eariy
'70s and a natural outgrowth of
campus political activism, then
there exists (aptly) a moral to the
story, for our campus and our
times: in every library addict, as
in every cloud, there exists a
silver lining.
