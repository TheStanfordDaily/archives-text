# Former agent says CIA leak intentional

Los Angeles (AP) — Former
CIA agent Victor Marchetti tes
tified yesterday that a top-secret
project allegedly leaked to the
Russians was once used as "a
dog and pony show" to entertain
congressmen considerng the
CIA budget.
After Marchetti's testimony,
U.S. District Court Judge Robert
Kelleher adjourned until today,
saying he expects the case then
will go to the jury after a final
lengthy session.
Marchetti, author of a con
troversial and heavily censored
book called The CIA and the
Cult of Intelligence, testified
under subpoena by defense at
torneys for Christopher Boyce,
charged with conspiring to sell
secrets to the Soviet Union.
Among the allegedly stolen
materials was the Pyramider Pro
ject, a global satellite spy com
munication network under
study by TRW Systems Inc. of
Redondo Beach, where Boyce
worked as a clerk in the coding
section.
Boyce was expected to testify
today.
Marchetti said the Pyramider
idea was brilliant but "would
never work."
"It was such a flimsy concept
at the time," be said of the pro
ject as he knew it in 1968, "just
an idea. Some people had reser

vations about it."
Thus, the CIA decided in 1968
to include the project in what he
called "a dog and pony show"
for congressional budget com
mittees.
"Why not tell Congress about
it? It's an interesting and fas
cinating program and if it didn't
work it would at least help pass
this year's budget" or perhaps
even serve to confuse the Rus
sians, Marchetti recalled.
"It might 'beep' down some
thing and the Soviets would go
bananas trying to figure out what
we were doing when in fact we
were doing nothing," he said.
Marchetti said as assistant to
the deputy director of theCIA he
helped prepare the budget pre
sentation seeking out interesting
projects, including Pyramider,
to show the committees.
Marchetti said Pyramider
"consisted of an orbiting satel
lite that would pass over certain
cities in denied areas like Russia
and at certain points in time and
would be able to communicate
with agents who would be
equipped with a very small re
ceiver and transmitter."
But he said those who told him
about it "did not seem to have
much faith in it. They seemed to
think it would technically be
almost an impossibility."
On cross-examination by the
government, Marchetti said the
1972 study of Pyramider's
feasibility—a document al
legedly stolen by Boyce —was
more complex than the plans he
saw in 1968.

to show the committees.
Marchetti said Pyramider
"consisted of an orbiting satel
lite that would pass over certain
cities in denied areas like Russia
and at certain points in time and
would be able to communicate
with agents who would be
equipped with a very small re
ceiver and transmitter."
But he said those who told him
about it "did not seem to have
much faith in it. They seemed to
think it would technically be
almost an impossibility."
On cross-examination by the
government, Marchetti said the
1972 study of Pyramider's
feasibility—a document al
legedly stolen by Boyce —was
more complex than the plans he
saw in 1968.
Los Angeles (AP) — Former
CIA agent Victor Marchetti tes
tified yesterday that a top-secret
project allegedly leaked to the
Russians was once used as "a
dog and pony show" to entertain
congressmen considerng the
CIA budget.
After Marchetti's testimony,
U.S. District Court Judge Robert
Kelleher adjourned until today,
saying he expects the case then
will go to the jury after a final
lengthy session.
Marchetti, author of a con
troversial and heavily censored
book called The CIA and the
Cult of Intelligence, testified
under subpoena by defense at
torneys for Christopher Boyce,
charged with conspiring to sell
secrets to the Soviet Union.
Among the allegedly stolen
materials was the Pyramider Pro
ject, a global satellite spy com
munication network under
study by TRW Systems Inc. of
Redondo Beach, where Boyce
worked as a clerk in the coding
section.
Boyce was expected to testify
today.
Marchetti said the Pyramider
idea was brilliant but "would
never work."
"It was such a flimsy concept
at the time," be said of the pro
ject as he knew it in 1968, "just
an idea. Some people had reser

vations about it."
Thus, the CIA decided in 1968
to include the project in what he
called "a dog and pony show"
for congressional budget com
mittees.
"Why not tell Congress about
it? It's an interesting and fas
cinating program and if it didn't
work it would at least help pass
this year's budget" or perhaps
even serve to confuse the Rus
sians, Marchetti recalled.
"It might 'beep' down some
thing and the Soviets would go
bananas trying to figure out what
we were doing when in fact we
were doing nothing," he said.
Marchetti said as assistant to
the deputy director of theCIA he
helped prepare the budget pre
sentation seeking out interesting
projects, including Pyramider,
to show the committees.
Marchetti said Pyramider
"consisted of an orbiting satel
lite that would pass over certain
cities in denied areas like Russia
and at certain points in time and
would be able to communicate
with agents who would be
equipped with a very small re
ceiver and transmitter."
But he said those who told him
about it "did not seem to have
much faith in it. They seemed to
think it would technically be
almost an impossibility."
On cross-examination by the
government, Marchetti said the
1972 study of Pyramider's
feasibility—a document al
legedly stolen by Boyce —was

saw in 1968.
