# Pete Wilson: ecology and expansion are possible

Urban sprawl is not only harmful to the envi
ronment, but is also harmful to the business cli
mate, according to San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson.
Speaking last week in Kresge Auditorium, Wil
son, considered by many to be a strong Republican
contender in the 1978 gubernatorial election, ad
vocated land use regulation and managed growth
policies.
"It's because of the certainty that my community
is growing that I have felt it an absolute necessity
to exert pressure ... in attempting to see to it that
that growth is steered into the existing urbanized
part of the city," said Wilson.
Wilson's attention has become focused on urban
sprawl because San Diego, the 10th largest city in
the United States, is one of the fastest growing
major urban areas in the nation.
Low tax rate
Citing reduction of tax rates as proof that his
measures are succeeding, Wilson said San Diego's
tax rate is the second lowest among the 10 major
cities in the state, is 27 per cent below the average
of those cities and the lowest since 1911.
He said he and his appointees have tried to
"manage residential growth and its costs" and are
"aggressively seeking new jobs for San Diego

people already living there in need of employ
ment."
He explained that he is concentrating on growth
policies because low density urban development
results in the hiring of additional city personnel
and increased need for public services, which
means increased taxes.
A recent study on his efforts, said Wilson, shows
that taxpayers will save $221 million in city and
school taxes between 1978 and 1995.
Business climate
Expanding from a local political emphasis to
statewide interests, Wilson cited a professional
study which ranked California's business climate
47th among the continental states.
He blamed this poor ranking on the state's busi
ness taxes (highest in the nation) and state and
local taxes (second highest in the nation).
"If we are to see a restoration of the climate of
opportunity, we are going to have to balance our
environmental health with our economic health,"
said Wilson.
"We can make it clear that we welcome clean
industry, that in fact we are going to aggressively
compete for it,"he said, "and when we do, we \vi I.
find that we have done something to improve the
quality of life in California."
