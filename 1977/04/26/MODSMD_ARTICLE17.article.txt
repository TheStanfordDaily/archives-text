# Efforts to cap oil spill blocked by weather

Stanvanger, Norway (AP) â€”
A total calm followed by gale
force winds and 20-foot waves
yesterday blocked efforts to cap
the three-day-old spill of oil
from the Bravo rig in the North
Sea and to contain the spreading
slick.
The offshore oil well operated
by the Phillips Petroleum Co. of
Bartlesville, Okla., continued to
spew out natural gas and 49,000
gallons of crude oil every hour,
feeding a slick already 20 miles
long and three miles wide in
Norway's Ekofisk oil field.
Two experts from the Red
Adair oil-well trouble-fighting
team of Houston, Tex., Boots

Hansen and Richard Hattenberg,
had planned to start operations
to cap the well early yesterday.
But the morning calm created
a dangerous concentration of
explosive gas and prevented the
men from mounting the Bravo
platform. They ware expected to
try again today.
In the evening, gale-force
winds developed, cancelling
plans by Phillipsand Norwegian
authorities to surround the slick
with booms and begin collecting
the oil into tankers with special
skimming equipment.
Waves in the area were said to
be more than 20 feet high, mak
ing the use of floating booms

impossible. But experts said the
storm, with winds of up to 43
knots, could also serve to break
down the spill naturally.
The wind turned southwes
terly, moving the slick toward
the southern Norwegian coast.
The Norwegian Metereological
Institute said the southwesterly
winds are expected to continue
for three days, pushing the oil 45
miles toward the coast.
The Ekofisk field is about 170
miles from the southern tip of
Norway. Winds first blew the
slick toward the Danish coast at
Jutland, and then shifted Sunday
night, pushing it toward the

Scottish coast 200 miles to the
west.
Officials said they have de
cided not to use special chemi
cals on the oil slick to break it up
unless it comes seriously close to
shore. Sea-life experts have
warned that the dispersant
chemicals might destroy rich
mackerel spawning grounds in
the sea.
Phillips spokesman Kjeti 1
Folme said the company had re
ceived Norwegian government
approval for its plans to cap the
pipe, bringing oil up from
10,000 feet beneath the sea floor.
He said at best, the operation

would take two or three days.
The rig "blew" on Friday dur
ing routine maintenance. With
all production from the Ekofisk
field shut down, Norway is los
ing an estimated $300,000 a day
in revenues.
Folme said Hansen and Hat
tenberg were on board the pipe
laying barge Tuctoalongside the
Bravo rig.
