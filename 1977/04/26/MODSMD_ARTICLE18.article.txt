## From 'rhinestone pop' to shining stars in Bay Area Jazz David miller Grover sparkles 
### 
Following a repetitive set by
Herbie Hancock, ('.rover
Washington )r. sparkled Friday
night before a one-quarter capac
ity crowd at the Circle Star
Theatre in San Carlos.
Hancock, who could have
been a jazz legend, has reverted
to rhinestone pop, playing
funky, simplistic chordal
changes that lack the fluid es
sence of jazz.
Once a sideman for Miles
Davis, Freddie I luhbard, Quincy
Jones, Milt Jackson and other
jazz greats, Hancock now sur
rounds himself with mediocre
musicians — guitarist Wah Wah
Watson in particular.
Watson, whose popularity has
soared recently, bent the same
two riffs for the entire set.
Benny Maupin's sax work and
Hancock's acoustic-sounding
electronic piano solos on songs
like "Centle Thoughts" and"It
Remains to be Seen" were the
group's highpoints.
When Grover Washington
came out, backed by his
Philadelphian band and a string
and horn section put together for
the evening, the mood instantly
changed.
With pianist Sid Simmons,
guitarist Richard Lee, bassist
Tvron Brown, drummer Pete
Vincent, percussionsist Dr.
Gibbs, and the incredible con
c.ertmaster John Blake on synth
esizers and solo violin,
Washington gave an innovative,
sensitive, diverse performance.

Washington's fluid music was
newer, more complex and acous
tic, tighter, and less repetitive
than Hancock's. Lee's guitar
work put Wah Wall Watson to
shame.
Washington's composition
"Love Song 170U" featured
sweet, baroque-like melodies
blending into intense jazz and
eerie string movements.
"Storm King," a Bob James
original, and "Funk Foot" by
violinist John Blake exhibited
driving wild rhythms, moments
of big band sound, clear compli
cated tonal mixtures, and fast,
full piano and violin solos.
"AVSV," which stands for "A
Very Special Vibe," was a soft,
delicate number by bassist
Brown.
Each song was different and
new. And throughout all of them
Washington's touching, com
manding and constantly chang
ing saxophone lines arched like
flowing crystal.
Washington's musicianship
could not, however, cure the
serious atmosphere problems of
(he Circle Star Theatre, which
features a revolving stage.
Plagued by over-priced, wat
ery drinks, a roller-derby ap
pearance and a dizzying stage
that continually snatches the
musicians from view just as the
visual excitement and intensity
of their performance begin to
take hold, theCircleStar Theatre
is a terrible place to see a jazz
concert.
