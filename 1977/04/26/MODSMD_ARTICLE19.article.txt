# 'Caribou' on campus

### 
Year of the Caribou, a strik
ingly beautiful, as well as
significant film, is a
documentary of one family's
self-sufficient existence in
northern Alaska, 85 miles
from the Arctic Circle.
The film-makers, Fred and
Elaine Meader, became dis
enchanted with modern soci
ety 15 years ago and the film
is a description of the life they
carved for themselves and
their son out of the apparently
inhospitable Brooks Range.
The major events, both recur
rent and unique, of the year
before their return to "civili
zation" constitute the sub

stance of the work, out of
which emerges a compelling
statement about the more im
portant issues of life. The dif
ferent rhythm of time mea
sured through seasons and
the different identity of man
mirrored in "unspoiled" na
ture are captured in the beaut
iful, color cinematography.
As a documentary, Year of
the Caribou is admirably un
encumbered: the people on
both sides of the camera are
notably un-self-conscious
and the sweeping shots of
lake and mountains breathe
purity.
