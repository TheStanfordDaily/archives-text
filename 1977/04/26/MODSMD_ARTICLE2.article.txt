# Flat rate utility fee angers frats, co-ops
## 
### Thatcher Freund 
The flat-rate utility fee which the
University plans to institute next year
for student living on campus is un
equitable, some fraternity and co-op
house managers say.
Co-ops and fraternities have paid
individual utility hills in the past, but
next year, as part of its housing rate
changes, the University will charge
each student $166 for utilities.
Matt Weinger, house manager for
the Kappa Sigma fraternity, asserted
that the University "will be charging
us 15 per cent more (next year) than
we've paid in the past."
Terra House residents seem to be
equally upset with the new flat rate.
According to figures available at the
Row office. Terra is using much less
electricity than other comparable resi
dences.
Figures for average monthly
kilowatt hours per student from Oc
tober 1975 to June 1976 range from 168
at Terra and 176 at ZAP. to 263 at the

Kappa Alpha house and 289 at the
Theta Delt house.
Heidi Schellman, who is leading the
reaction at Terra, said students at Terra
"don't like the idea of subsidizing was
tage at other houses." Schellman said
she would like to see some method of
creating an incentive to conserve
energy.
Tom Hornbeak, assistant director of
Row housing, said charging each stu
dent the same utility fee is "part of the
continuing attempt by housing man
agement to average University costs
among students."
"It's fair to average costs," Hornbeak
said, because "Stanford follows an
equity principle in its residence sys
tem."
TheCowell cluster houses and many
of the fraternities were using a great
deal of steam and electricity despite
the fact that they were billed sepa
rately, he said. "In part this was be
cause the buildings were poorly de
signed for energy conservation."

But Joe Wender, financial manager
at Columbae House, said everyone at
Columbae "feels pretty powerless."
"As 1 see it," YVender said, "there's
no way to fight it unless there are
further breakdowns" of costs.
The fraternities in particular are
concerned with other aspects of the
new housing rates. One complaint
shared by many fraternity house man
agers is that the fraternities will be
charged the same fee for residential
education as most dormitories.
Fees for Residential Education go to
the "field staff" of the housing office,
which includes dormitory and Row

housing offices and resident assistants
(HAs), and to certain program fees.
Many fraternities feel that RAs play
an insignificant role in fraternity life.
Slusser said "the RAs' function in a
fraternity is minimal. Our own officers
can certainly provide the functions of
an KA."
The University disagrees, however.
"The University residential offices
agree that there is a role" for the RA in
a fraternity, Uornbeak said. There are
emergencies that arise, he said, adding
that the RA provides certain counsel
ing functions, and maintains a con
tinuity for the houses.

the fact that they were billed sepa
rately, he said. "In part this was be
cause the buildings were poorly de
signed for energy conservation."

But Joe Wender, financial manager
at Columbae House, said everyone at
Columbae "feels pretty powerless."
"As 1 see it," YVender said, "there's
no way to fight it unless there are
further breakdowns" of costs.
The fraternities in particular are
concerned with other aspects of the
new housing rates. One complaint
shared by many fraternity house man
agers is that the fraternities will be
charged the same fee for residential
education as most dormitories.
Fees for Residential Education go to
the "field staff" of the housing office,
which includes dormitory and Row

housing offices and resident assistants
(HAs), and to certain program fees.
Many fraternities feel that RAs play
an insignificant role in fraternity life.
Slusser said "the RAs' function in a
fraternity is minimal. Our own officers
can certainly provide the functions of
an KA."
The University disagrees, however.
"The University residential offices
agree that there is a role" for the RA in
a fraternity, Uornbeak said. There are
emergencies that arise, he said, adding
that the RA provides certain counsel
ing functions, and maintains a con
tinuity for the houses.


Frats, co-ops upset
Columbae House is one of a number of small houses
concerned with the flat-rate utility fee to be charged to

residents next year. This year each fraternity and co-op
is billed according to what they use and each resident
pays a share of that.
The flat-rate utility fee which the
University plans to institute next year
for student living on campus is un
equitable, some fraternity and co-op
house managers say.
Co-ops and fraternities have paid
individual utility hills in the past, but
next year, as part of its housing rate
changes, the University will charge
each student $166 for utilities.
Matt Weinger, house manager for
the Kappa Sigma fraternity, asserted
that the University "will be charging
us 15 per cent more (next year) than
we've paid in the past."
Terra House residents seem to be
equally upset with the new flat rate.
According to figures available at the
Row office. Terra is using much less
electricity than other comparable resi
dences.
Figures for average monthly
kilowatt hours per student from Oc
tober 1975 to June 1976 range from 168
at Terra and 176 at ZAP. to 263 at the

Kappa Alpha house and 289 at the
Theta Delt house.
Heidi Schellman, who is leading the
reaction at Terra, said students at Terra
"don't like the idea of subsidizing was
tage at other houses." Schellman said
she would like to see some method of
creating an incentive to conserve
energy.
Tom Hornbeak, assistant director of
Row housing, said charging each stu
dent the same utility fee is "part of the
continuing attempt by housing man
agement to average University costs
among students."
"It's fair to average costs," Hornbeak
said, because "Stanford follows an
equity principle in its residence sys
tem."
TheCowell cluster houses and many
of the fraternities were using a great
deal of steam and electricity despite
the fact that they were billed sepa
rately, he said. "In part this was be
