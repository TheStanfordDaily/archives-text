## J.L. Ponty jazz 'jewel' 
### 
The extravagant labels cur
rently applied to it not
withstanding, the idea of virtu
ousity can be conceived of quite
simply: given the question,
"Will i know it when 1 hear (or
see, or otherwise experience)
it?" an unequivocally affirma
tive answer is possible only in
the presence of the real thing.
The real thing was present at
the San Jose Center for the Per
forming Arts last Thursday
evening in the person of Jean Luc
Ponty. The most recent claimant
to the throne of the electric-jazz
violinists, Ponty has come a long
way since his pre-John
McLaughlin days. He has the po
tential to go fart her stil 1, but even
at his present stage of develop
ment, he is one of the brightest
jewels in the electric crown of
jazz.
Playing a set of pieces from his
three post-McLaughlin albums,
Ponty showed that he learned
his lesson well from the first jazz
musician to take impeccable in
strumental mastery into the
realm of electronic amplifica
tion. In fact, Ponty's perfor
mance showed that he has ar
rived at pre-eminence in that
branch of music referred to as
jazz-rock.
Delicate potential
His most serious shortcoming
at present was especially man
ifest in the acoustic "Garden of
Babylon." The undeniable truth
is that Ponty lacks the piercing,
pure beauty of much of

McLaughlin's (and to a lesser
degree, Chick Corea's,) work.
"Garden of Babylon" was com
petent, but Ponty and bis band,
Darryl Stuermer on guitar, Alan
Zavod on keyboards, Steve
Smith on drums and Ralph
Armstrong on bass, failed to shift
from the power of the electric
mode into the delicate aesthetic
potential of unamplified strings.
This weakness served, how
ever, to underscore Ponty's great
strength: a raw, rippling vitality,
characteristic of a grasp of the
primal element in music which
bypasses intellectual percep
tion. It was the loss of this spon
taneous expression of life which
crippled McLaughlin (and no
number of personnel changes is
likely to bring it back), while
Larry Coryell's insufficient en
dowment of it prevented him
from challenging McLaughlin's
supremacy during his rule of
jazz-rock. But Ponty is thriving
by its virtue.
In the title track from Imugi
nary Voyage and selections from
Aurora, Ponty's violin generated
streams of multi-colored aural
sparks which soared into the
blackness and faded out of sight
with magnetic glow. The soloist
wove his runs, both stupefying
in their speed and compelling in
their melodic improvisation,
into the background of palpable
rhythms familiar yet utterly orig
inal.
Accompaniment
One measure of a musician is
the quality of the musicians with
whom he plays. From scrutiny in
the light of this criterion, Ponty
emerges no less a master.
Stuermer's guitar work was
pivotal in this regard: he stood to
suffer most in comparison, both
to Ponty himself and to the other
guitarists with whom Ponty has
played.
lie came through excellently,
not trying to compete with Pon
ty's (and McLaughlin's) dazzl
ing digital dexterity, but build

ing stunningly complex layers ot
improvisation on the melodic
premise.
Zavod on keyboards did not
quite reach the same summit, a
result occasioned, perhaps, by
the inevitable dilution of atten
tionattendant upon the presence
of too many electronic play
things—on each of which tin;
keyboardist is obliged to take a
few licks.
Bassist Armstrong is a recent
addition to Ponty's retinue and
as such harmonized with the
band surprisingly well. Even
more importantly, Armstrong
proved himself worthy of Pon
ty's patronage with a searing
solo toward the end of the set
during which he seemed to set a
new upper limit on the speed
with which the instrument can
be played.
No Cobham
Smith on drums achieved the
same adequacy as Zavod; he
does not, unfortunately, possess
the sense for innovative rhythm
of a Billy Cobham.
Vocalist-guitarist Michael
Franks opened the show and
seemed to be the main attraction
for about a third of the audience.
He played an entertaining set,
highlig'hted by "Popsicle Toes,"
but one kept wishing for some
thing more than his Mose
Allison-esque singing: his
acoustic guitar sounded in such
fine tune, it seemed a pity he
didn't feel comfortable enough
with it to take a full-fledged solo
in front of his excellent band.
But Franks' lack of true ac
complishment, that is, his lack of
virtuousity, was betrayed in the
response he elicited from the
audience: when he left the stage,
he received the minimal
applause necessary to warrant
an encore; when Ponty left, the
audience stood as one and clap
ped, cheered, whistled and ul
timately screamed for more than
two minutes before the maestro
returned.


Soft light
Mary Lou Williams and her trio will appear at the Keystone
Korner San Francisco tonight through May 8. Williams' fluid
piano style and longevity in jazz have earned her a prominent
place in almost everyone's personal jazz hall of fame.

rently applied to it not
withstanding, the idea of virtu
ousity can be conceived of quite
simply: given the question,
"Will i know it when 1 hear (or
see, or otherwise experience)
it?" an unequivocally affirma
tive answer is possible only in
the presence of the real thing.
The real thing was present at
the San Jose Center for the Per
forming Arts last Thursday
evening in the person of Jean Luc
Ponty. The most recent claimant
to the throne of the electric-jazz
violinists, Ponty has come a long
way since his pre-John
McLaughlin days. He has the po
tential to go fart her stil 1, but even
at his present stage of develop
ment, he is one of the brightest
jewels in the electric crown of
jazz.
Playing a set of pieces from his
three post-McLaughlin albums,
Ponty showed that he learned
his lesson well from the first jazz
musician to take impeccable in
strumental mastery into the
realm of electronic amplifica
tion. In fact, Ponty's perfor
mance showed that he has ar
rived at pre-eminence in that
branch of music referred to as
jazz-rock.
Delicate potential
His most serious shortcoming
at present was especially man
ifest in the acoustic "Garden of
Babylon." The undeniable truth
is that Ponty lacks the piercing,
pure beauty of much of

McLaughlin's (and to a lesser
degree, Chick Corea's,) work.
"Garden of Babylon" was com
petent, but Ponty and bis band,
Darryl Stuermer on guitar, Alan
Zavod on keyboards, Steve
Smith on drums and Ralph
Armstrong on bass, failed to shift
from the power of the electric
mode into the delicate aesthetic
potential of unamplified strings.
This weakness served, how
ever, to underscore Ponty's great
strength: a raw, rippling vitality,
characteristic of a grasp of the
primal element in music which
bypasses intellectual percep
tion. It was the loss of this spon
taneous expression of life which
crippled McLaughlin (and no
number of personnel changes is
likely to bring it back), while
Larry Coryell's insufficient en
dowment of it prevented him
from challenging McLaughlin's
supremacy during his rule of
jazz-rock. But Ponty is thriving
by its virtue.
In the title track from Imugi
nary Voyage and selections from
Aurora, Ponty's violin generated
streams of multi-colored aural
sparks which soared into the
blackness and faded out of sight
with magnetic glow. The soloist
wove his runs, both stupefying
in their speed and compelling in
their melodic improvisation,
into the background of palpable
rhythms familiar yet utterly orig
inal.
Accompaniment
One measure of a musician is
the quality of the musicians with
whom he plays. From scrutiny in
the light of this criterion, Ponty
emerges no less a master.
Stuermer's guitar work was
pivotal in this regard: he stood to
suffer most in comparison, both
to Ponty himself and to the other
guitarists with whom Ponty has
played.
lie came through excellently,
not trying to compete with Pon
ty's (and McLaughlin's) dazzl
ing digital dexterity, but build

ing stunningly complex layers ot
improvisation on the melodic
premise.
Zavod on keyboards did not
quite reach the same summit, a
result occasioned, perhaps, by
the inevitable dilution of atten
tionattendant upon the presence
of too many electronic play
things—on each of which tin;
keyboardist is obliged to take a
few licks.
Bassist Armstrong is a recent
addition to Ponty's retinue and
as such harmonized with the
band surprisingly well. Even
more importantly, Armstrong
proved himself worthy of Pon
ty's patronage with a searing
solo toward the end of the set
during which he seemed to set a
new upper limit on the speed
with which the instrument can
be played.
No Cobham
Smith on drums achieved the
same adequacy as Zavod; he
does not, unfortunately, possess
the sense for innovative rhythm
of a Billy Cobham.
Vocalist-guitarist Michael
Franks opened the show and
seemed to be the main attraction
for about a third of the audience.
He played an entertaining set,
highlig'hted by "Popsicle Toes,"
but one kept wishing for some
thing more than his Mose
Allison-esque singing: his
acoustic guitar sounded in such
fine tune, it seemed a pity he
didn't feel comfortable enough
with it to take a full-fledged solo
in front of his excellent band.
But Franks' lack of true ac
complishment, that is, his lack of
virtuousity, was betrayed in the
response he elicited from the
audience: when he left the stage,
he received the minimal
applause necessary to warrant
an encore; when Ponty left, the
audience stood as one and clap
ped, cheered, whistled and ul
timately screamed for more than
two minutes before the maestro
returned.

Korner San Francisco tonight through May 8. Williams' fluid
piano style and longevity in jazz have earned her a prominent
place in almost everyone's personal jazz hall of fame.

withstanding, the idea of virtu
ousity can be conceived of quite
simply: given the question,
"Will i know it when 1 hear (or
see, or otherwise experience)
it?" an unequivocally affirma
tive answer is possible only in
the presence of the real thing.
The real thing was present at
the San Jose Center for the Per
forming Arts last Thursday
evening in the person of Jean Luc
Ponty. The most recent claimant
to the throne of the electric-jazz
violinists, Ponty has come a long
way since his pre-John
McLaughlin days. He has the po
tential to go fart her stil 1, but even
at his present stage of develop
ment, he is one of the brightest
jewels in the electric crown of
jazz.
Playing a set of pieces from his
three post-McLaughlin albums,
Ponty showed that he learned
his lesson well from the first jazz
musician to take impeccable in
strumental mastery into the
realm of electronic amplifica
tion. In fact, Ponty's perfor
mance showed that he has ar
rived at pre-eminence in that
branch of music referred to as
jazz-rock.
Delicate potential
His most serious shortcoming
at present was especially man
ifest in the acoustic "Garden of
Babylon." The undeniable truth
is that Ponty lacks the piercing,
pure beauty of much of

McLaughlin's (and to a lesser
degree, Chick Corea's,) work.
"Garden of Babylon" was com
petent, but Ponty and bis band,
Darryl Stuermer on guitar, Alan
Zavod on keyboards, Steve
Smith on drums and Ralph
Armstrong on bass, failed to shift
from the power of the electric
mode into the delicate aesthetic
potential of unamplified strings.
This weakness served, how
ever, to underscore Ponty's great
strength: a raw, rippling vitality,
characteristic of a grasp of the
primal element in music which
bypasses intellectual percep
tion. It was the loss of this spon
taneous expression of life which
crippled McLaughlin (and no
number of personnel changes is
likely to bring it back), while
Larry Coryell's insufficient en
dowment of it prevented him
from challenging McLaughlin's
supremacy during his rule of
jazz-rock. But Ponty is thriving
by its virtue.
In the title track from Imugi
nary Voyage and selections from
Aurora, Ponty's violin generated
streams of multi-colored aural
sparks which soared into the
blackness and faded out of sight
with magnetic glow. The soloist
wove his runs, both stupefying
in their speed and compelling in
their melodic improvisation,
into the background of palpable
rhythms familiar yet utterly orig
inal.
Accompaniment
One measure of a musician is
the quality of the musicians with
whom he plays. From scrutiny in
the light of this criterion, Ponty
emerges no less a master.
Stuermer's guitar work was
pivotal in this regard: he stood to
suffer most in comparison, both
to Ponty himself and to the other
guitarists with whom Ponty has
played.
lie came through excellently,
not trying to compete with Pon
ty's (and McLaughlin's) dazzl
ing digital dexterity, but build

ing stunningly complex layers ot
improvisation on the melodic
premise.
Zavod on keyboards did not
quite reach the same summit, a
result occasioned, perhaps, by
the inevitable dilution of atten
tionattendant upon the presence
of too many electronic play
things—on each of which tin;
keyboardist is obliged to take a
few licks.
Bassist Armstrong is a recent
addition to Ponty's retinue and
as such harmonized with the
band surprisingly well. Even
more importantly, Armstrong
proved himself worthy of Pon
ty's patronage with a searing
solo toward the end of the set
during which he seemed to set a
new upper limit on the speed
with which the instrument can
be played.
No Cobham
Smith on drums achieved the
same adequacy as Zavod; he
does not, unfortunately, possess
the sense for innovative rhythm
of a Billy Cobham.
Vocalist-guitarist Michael
Franks opened the show and
seemed to be the main attraction
for about a third of the audience.
He played an entertaining set,
highlig'hted by "Popsicle Toes,"
but one kept wishing for some
thing more than his Mose
Allison-esque singing: his
acoustic guitar sounded in such
fine tune, it seemed a pity he
didn't feel comfortable enough
with it to take a full-fledged solo
in front of his excellent band.
But Franks' lack of true ac
complishment, that is, his lack of
virtuousity, was betrayed in the
response he elicited from the
audience: when he left the stage,
he received the minimal
applause necessary to warrant
an encore; when Ponty left, the
audience stood as one and clap
ped, cheered, whistled and ul
timately screamed for more than
two minutes before the maestro
returned.


Soft light
Mary Lou Williams and her trio will appear at the Keystone
Korner San Francisco tonight through May 8. Williams' fluid
piano style and longevity in jazz have earned her a prominent
place in almost everyone's personal jazz hall of fame.
