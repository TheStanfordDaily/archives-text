## Frank Sinatra at the Circle Star: the old magic is still there 
### 
A sold-out Circle Star Theatre
crowd of middle-aged bobby
soxers let out a roar as Frank
Sinatra bounded youthfully to
the stage and sang a disco ver
sion of "All or Nothing At All."
Yes, hi s eyes are still very blue.
Frank Sinatra is 61 years old.
He was discovered in a small
New Jersey nightclub in 1939,
where he was working as a sing
ing head-waiter, by big-band
leader Harry James. He origi
nally recorded "All or Nothing
At All" that year with James.
* * *
His voice has aged. He sang
"My Funny Valentine," to a loud
ovation of fans who were either
unaware of or, more likely, un
concerned with the fact that he
screeched at the high notes of the
bridge.
I have determined, upon hear
ing a host of idle comments, that
no celebrity has a worse reputa
tion among young people than
Frank Sinatra (save Richard Ni
xon). A young person's picture:
he's a gangster, he's in the Mafia,
he owns half of Las Vegas, he
hates the press, he's punched
out several reporters, he's been
banned from a lot of countries,
he's a reactionary, he's good
friends with Nixon and Agnew,
his music is dull.
Sinatra sang "I Write the
Songs" and forgot the lyrics.
Example: "I sing the songs that
made ka da da da sing." That's
okay. The Beatles did it too.
Imagine you have never heard
of Frank Sinatra. You go to
someone's house and the person
is playing the album One More
For the Road. (It was very im
portant to Sinatra to make the
group of songs on an album have

an overall meaning.) The first
song is "Come Fly With Me."
Perhaps the style isn't appealing
to you, but you can't ignore The
Voice. Sinatra sings like a trom
bone; a trombone played by
Tommy Dorsey.
Dorsey was the god of the
big-band leaders in the late '30s
and '40s, but more than that, his
tone on the trombone was like
liquid glass; smooth, flowing,
and cool. He played ballads with
unfaultering vibrato and up
tempo jazz with rakish confi
dence and brassy punch.
It was with Dorsey's band,
who outbid Harry James in 1940,
that Sinatra learned to sing. He
listened night after night to Dor
sey's playing and finally trans
lated the style from trombone to
voice. He especially emulated
Dorsey's lyric phrasing and the
technique of breathing through
the notes.
Sinatra sings songs like he
means them. The words create a
feeling of casual conversation
with a friend as he bends the
melody and slides to and from
the notes. It's the Sinatra mood.
★ * *
He sang a few songs I was un
familiar with ("Where or When"
and"I Love My Wife") and then
the orchestra began a famous
Nelson Riddle arrangement. It
was "For Once in My Life," and
the old Sinatra was back. He
warmed up, finally, and began to
swing with typical Sinatra body
language: dance steps and leaps,
directions for the orchestra, and
poses for pretty photographers.
Sinatra broke with Dorsey in a
daring and dangerous move, in
1942, to set out on a soio career.
He made it. On Columbus Day,
1944, 30,000 bobby-soxers

rioted at the Paramount Theatre
in Times Square. (Swooning
didn't start with Elvis or the Bea
tles.) In one of his biographies,
Sinatra explains the reaction:
"Perfectly simple; it was the war
years and there was a great lonel
iness, and I was the boy in every
corner drug-store, the boy who'd
gone off drafted to the war.
That's all."

He sang "My Kind of To wn," a
Sinatra classic from the early
'60s. With a drink in one hand,
he stood still in the center of the
revolving stage, and belted out
the tune just like the record. He
received a standing ovation.
Sinatra never performs or re
cords before 8 p.m. He wi 11 often
drag the whole orchestra and
technical crew out at 3 a.m. to

rehearse. Between songs he fills
with one-liners and additional
anecdotes. "Did you know Alex
Haley was adopted?" Earlier in
the day, he had thrown out the
first basebal 1 at the Giants' Open
ing Day."I haven't been outside
since I was eleven."
The late '40s: Sinatra got in a
fight with an entertainment col
umnist which led to a lawsuit

and much undue harassment
from the press (which was to
continue forever); he started a
career in the movies and was less
than a box office hit; he had seri
ous marital troubles with his
first wife Nancy; Columbia Re
cords' Mitch Miller wanted
Sinatra to record gimicky songs
which were becoming a fad;
Sinatra broke with Columbia; his
CBS television program failed;
he lost his voice.
Comeback: Sinatra married
Ava Gardner and flew to Africa
with her where she was filming a
movie (he had no job). In 1953,
he flew back to Hollywood and
talked Columbia Pictures into
letting him play "Maggio" in
"From Here To Eternity." He
won an Oscar for Best Support
ing Actor. Sinatra was suddenly
in great demand again and the
money came rolling in. He began
to build a kingdom around the
Sands Hotel in Las Vegas.
* * *
He sang "Sorry Seems to Be
the Hardest Word" by Elton John
and Barry Manilow's "See the
Show Again." Both failed to
convey any mood. Next, Sinatra
lurched into a disco version of
Cole Porter's "Night and Day,"
one of the earliest Sinatra clas
sics. It almost made me ill.
Capitol Records recorded
Sinatra during most of the '50s,
but he became disenchanted
with them and formed his own
company, Reprise Records, in
1961. New arrangers included
Count Basie and Quincy Jones.
Bing Crosby, Dean Martin,
Sammy Davis, Jr. all signed with
Reprise.
The press was continually
concerned with Sinatra and his
women. It's impossible to tell a

fact from a rumor unleashed by a
vindictive reporter. (Dean Mar
tin said, "When Sinatra dies
they're giving his zipper to the
Smithsonian.")
Sinatra married Mia Farrow
and subsequently Barbara Marx.
He almost drowned in Hawaii,
in 1964.
His son was kidnapped and re
turned safely in 1963.
The lights dropped and only
one spotlight was left on his face.
Smoke rings from his cigarette
bent around the microphone.
His lips parted and he slid into
"Send in the Clowns," his
post-Nixon hit. When he paused
at the end of a phrase the audi
ence seemed to hold its breath.
Sinatra's business endeavors
in Nevada (he owned North
Shore Tahoe's Cal-Neva Lodge
for a time) coupled with frequent
trips to Havana, caused him to be
linked to the Mafia by many re
porters. He always denied any
connection. Politically, he was
good friends with President
Kennedy and campaigned heav
ily for him. In later years, he has
been seen with Reagan, Agnew
and Nixon.
Sinatra's generosity began
early and never ended. He paid
for whole tours out of his pocket
to raise money for charities.
Handicapped children, Jerry
Lewis' Telethon, and Israel were
the most popular. During the
Gary, Indiana race riots in 1946,
he spoke at high schools that re
fused to admit blacks.
* * *
Sinatra finished with two up
tempo classics, "I've Got You
Under My Skin" and"The Lady
is a Tramp." It was a long stand
ing ovation.

Frank Sinatra
A sold-out Circle Star Theatre
crowd of middle-aged bobby
soxers let out a roar as Frank
Sinatra bounded youthfully to
the stage and sang a disco ver
sion of "All or Nothing At All."
Yes, hi s eyes are still very blue.
Frank Sinatra is 61 years old.
He was discovered in a small
New Jersey nightclub in 1939,
where he was working as a sing
ing head-waiter, by big-band
leader Harry James. He origi
nally recorded "All or Nothing
At All" that year with James.
* * *
His voice has aged. He sang
"My Funny Valentine," to a loud
ovation of fans who were either
unaware of or, more likely, un
concerned with the fact that he
screeched at the high notes of the
bridge.
I have determined, upon hear
ing a host of idle comments, that
no celebrity has a worse reputa
tion among young people than
Frank Sinatra (save Richard Ni
xon). A young person's picture:
he's a gangster, he's in the Mafia,
he owns half of Las Vegas, he
hates the press, he's punched
out several reporters, he's been
banned from a lot of countries,
he's a reactionary, he's good
friends with Nixon and Agnew,
his music is dull.
Sinatra sang "I Write the
Songs" and forgot the lyrics.
Example: "I sing the songs that
made ka da da da sing." That's
okay. The Beatles did it too.
Imagine you have never heard
of Frank Sinatra. You go to
someone's house and the person
is playing the album One More
For the Road. (It was very im
portant to Sinatra to make the
group of songs on an album have

an overall meaning.) The first
song is "Come Fly With Me."
Perhaps the style isn't appealing
to you, but you can't ignore The
Voice. Sinatra sings like a trom
bone; a trombone played by
Tommy Dorsey.
Dorsey was the god of the
big-band leaders in the late '30s
and '40s, but more than that, his
tone on the trombone was like
liquid glass; smooth, flowing,
and cool. He played ballads with
unfaultering vibrato and up
tempo jazz with rakish confi
dence and brassy punch.
It was with Dorsey's band,
who outbid Harry James in 1940,
that Sinatra learned to sing. He
listened night after night to Dor
sey's playing and finally trans
lated the style from trombone to
voice. He especially emulated
Dorsey's lyric phrasing and the
technique of breathing through
the notes.
Sinatra sings songs like he
means them. The words create a
feeling of casual conversation
with a friend as he bends the
melody and slides to and from
the notes. It's the Sinatra mood.
★ * *
He sang a few songs I was un
familiar with ("Where or When"
and"I Love My Wife") and then
the orchestra began a famous
Nelson Riddle arrangement. It
was "For Once in My Life," and
the old Sinatra was back. He
warmed up, finally, and began to
swing with typical Sinatra body
language: dance steps and leaps,
directions for the orchestra, and
poses for pretty photographers.
Sinatra broke with Dorsey in a
daring and dangerous move, in
1942, to set out on a soio career.
He made it. On Columbus Day,
1944, 30,000 bobby-soxers

rioted at the Paramount Theatre
in Times Square. (Swooning
didn't start with Elvis or the Bea
tles.) In one of his biographies,
Sinatra explains the reaction:
"Perfectly simple; it was the war
years and there was a great lonel
iness, and I was the boy in every
corner drug-store, the boy who'd
gone off drafted to the war.
That's all."

He sang "My Kind of To wn," a
Sinatra classic from the early
'60s. With a drink in one hand,
he stood still in the center of the
revolving stage, and belted out
the tune just like the record. He
received a standing ovation.
Sinatra never performs or re
cords before 8 p.m. He wi 11 often
drag the whole orchestra and
technical crew out at 3 a.m. to

rehearse. Between songs he fills
with one-liners and additional
anecdotes. "Did you know Alex
Haley was adopted?" Earlier in
the day, he had thrown out the
first basebal 1 at the Giants' Open
ing Day."I haven't been outside
since I was eleven."
The late '40s: Sinatra got in a
fight with an entertainment col
umnist which led to a lawsuit

and much undue harassment
from the press (which was to
continue forever); he started a
career in the movies and was less
than a box office hit; he had seri
ous marital troubles with his
first wife Nancy; Columbia Re
cords' Mitch Miller wanted
Sinatra to record gimicky songs
which were becoming a fad;
Sinatra broke with Columbia; his
CBS television program failed;
he lost his voice.
Comeback: Sinatra married
Ava Gardner and flew to Africa
with her where she was filming a
movie (he had no job). In 1953,
he flew back to Hollywood and
talked Columbia Pictures into
letting him play "Maggio" in
"From Here To Eternity." He
won an Oscar for Best Support
ing Actor. Sinatra was suddenly
in great demand again and the
money came rolling in. He began
to build a kingdom around the
Sands Hotel in Las Vegas.
* * *
He sang "Sorry Seems to Be
the Hardest Word" by Elton John
and Barry Manilow's "See the
Show Again." Both failed to
convey any mood. Next, Sinatra
lurched into a disco version of
Cole Porter's "Night and Day,"
one of the earliest Sinatra clas
sics. It almost made me ill.
Capitol Records recorded
Sinatra during most of the '50s,
but he became disenchanted
with them and formed his own
company, Reprise Records, in
1961. New arrangers included
Count Basie and Quincy Jones.
Bing Crosby, Dean Martin,
Sammy Davis, Jr. all signed with
Reprise.
The press was continually
concerned with Sinatra and his
women. It's impossible to tell a

fact from a rumor unleashed by a
vindictive reporter. (Dean Mar
tin said, "When Sinatra dies
they're giving his zipper to the
Smithsonian.")
Sinatra married Mia Farrow
and subsequently Barbara Marx.
He almost drowned in Hawaii,
in 1964.
His son was kidnapped and re
turned safely in 1963.
The lights dropped and only
one spotlight was left on his face.
Smoke rings from his cigarette
bent around the microphone.
His lips parted and he slid into
"Send in the Clowns," his
post-Nixon hit. When he paused
at the end of a phrase the audi
ence seemed to hold its breath.
Sinatra's business endeavors
in Nevada (he owned North
Shore Tahoe's Cal-Neva Lodge
for a time) coupled with frequent
trips to Havana, caused him to be
linked to the Mafia by many re
porters. He always denied any
connection. Politically, he was
good friends with President
Kennedy and campaigned heav
ily for him. In later years, he has
been seen with Reagan, Agnew
and Nixon.

bent around the microphone.

"Send in the Clowns," his
post-Nixon hit. When he paused

Sinatra's business endeavors
in Nevada (he owned North
Shore Tahoe's Cal-Neva Lodge
for a time) coupled with frequent
trips to Havana, caused him to be
linked to the Mafia by many re
porters. He always denied any
connection. Politically, he was
good friends with President
Kennedy and campaigned heav

been seen with Reagan, Agnew
and Nixon.
Sinatra's generosity began
early and never ended. He paid
for whole tours out of his pocket

Handicapped children, Jerry

he spoke at high schools that re

Frank Sinatra
A sold-out Circle Star Theatre
crowd of middle-aged bobby
soxers let out a roar as Frank
Sinatra bounded youthfully to
the stage and sang a disco ver
sion of "All or Nothing At All."
Yes, hi s eyes are still very blue.
Frank Sinatra is 61 years old.
He was discovered in a small
New Jersey nightclub in 1939,
where he was working as a sing
ing head-waiter, by big-band
leader Harry James. He origi
nally recorded "All or Nothing
At All" that year with James.
* * *
His voice has aged. He sang
"My Funny Valentine," to a loud
ovation of fans who were either
unaware of or, more likely, un
concerned with the fact that he
screeched at the high notes of the
bridge.
I have determined, upon hear
ing a host of idle comments, that
no celebrity has a worse reputa
tion among young people than
Frank Sinatra (save Richard Ni
xon). A young person's picture:
he's a gangster, he's in the Mafia,
he owns half of Las Vegas, he
hates the press, he's punched
out several reporters, he's been
banned from a lot of countries,
he's a reactionary, he's good
friends with Nixon and Agnew,
his music is dull.
Sinatra sang "I Write the
Songs" and forgot the lyrics.
Example: "I sing the songs that
made ka da da da sing." That's
okay. The Beatles did it too.
Imagine you have never heard
of Frank Sinatra. You go to
someone's house and the person
is playing the album One More
For the Road. (It was very im
portant to Sinatra to make the
group of songs on an album have

an overall meaning.) The first
song is "Come Fly With Me."
Perhaps the style isn't appealing
to you, but you can't ignore The
Voice. Sinatra sings like a trom
bone; a trombone played by
Tommy Dorsey.
Dorsey was the god of the
big-band leaders in the late '30s
and '40s, but more than that, his
tone on the trombone was like
liquid glass; smooth, flowing,
and cool. He played ballads with
unfaultering vibrato and up
tempo jazz with rakish confi
dence and brassy punch.
It was with Dorsey's band,
who outbid Harry James in 1940,
that Sinatra learned to sing. He
listened night after night to Dor
sey's playing and finally trans
lated the style from trombone to
voice. He especially emulated
Dorsey's lyric phrasing and the
technique of breathing through
the notes.
Sinatra sings songs like he
means them. The words create a
feeling of casual conversation
with a friend as he bends the
melody and slides to and from
the notes. It's the Sinatra mood.
★ * *
He sang a few songs I was un
familiar with ("Where or When"
and"I Love My Wife") and then
the orchestra began a famous
Nelson Riddle arrangement. It
was "For Once in My Life," and
the old Sinatra was back. He
warmed up, finally, and began to
swing with typical Sinatra body
language: dance steps and leaps,
directions for the orchestra, and
poses for pretty photographers.
Sinatra broke with Dorsey in a
daring and dangerous move, in
1942, to set out on a soio career.
He made it. On Columbus Day,
1944, 30,000 bobby-soxers

rioted at the Paramount Theatre
in Times Square. (Swooning
didn't start with Elvis or the Bea
tles.) In one of his biographies,
Sinatra explains the reaction:
"Perfectly simple; it was the war
years and there was a great lonel
iness, and I was the boy in every
corner drug-store, the boy who'd
gone off drafted to the war.
That's all."

He sang "My Kind of To wn," a
Sinatra classic from the early
'60s. With a drink in one hand,
he stood still in the center of the
revolving stage, and belted out
the tune just like the record. He
received a standing ovation.
Sinatra never performs or re
cords before 8 p.m. He wi 11 often
drag the whole orchestra and
technical crew out at 3 a.m. to

rehearse. Between songs he fills
with one-liners and additional
anecdotes. "Did you know Alex
Haley was adopted?" Earlier in
the day, he had thrown out the
first basebal 1 at the Giants' Open
ing Day."I haven't been outside
since I was eleven."
The late '40s: Sinatra got in a
fight with an entertainment col
umnist which led to a lawsuit

and much undue harassment
from the press (which was to
continue forever); he started a
career in the movies and was less
than a box office hit; he had seri
ous marital troubles with his
first wife Nancy; Columbia Re
cords' Mitch Miller wanted
Sinatra to record gimicky songs
which were becoming a fad;
Sinatra broke with Columbia; his
CBS television program failed;
he lost his voice.
Comeback: Sinatra married
Ava Gardner and flew to Africa
with her where she was filming a
movie (he had no job). In 1953,
he flew back to Hollywood and
talked Columbia Pictures into
letting him play "Maggio" in
"From Here To Eternity." He
won an Oscar for Best Support
ing Actor. Sinatra was suddenly
in great demand again and the
money came rolling in. He began
to build a kingdom around the
Sands Hotel in Las Vegas.
* * *
He sang "Sorry Seems to Be
the Hardest Word" by Elton John
and Barry Manilow's "See the
Show Again." Both failed to
convey any mood. Next, Sinatra
lurched into a disco version of
Cole Porter's "Night and Day,"
one of the earliest Sinatra clas
sics. It almost made me ill.
Capitol Records recorded
Sinatra during most of the '50s,
but he became disenchanted
with them and formed his own
company, Reprise Records, in
1961. New arrangers included
Count Basie and Quincy Jones.
Bing Crosby, Dean Martin,
Sammy Davis, Jr. all signed with
Reprise.
The press was continually
concerned with Sinatra and his
women. It's impossible to tell a

fact from a rumor unleashed by a
vindictive reporter. (Dean Mar
tin said, "When Sinatra dies
they're giving his zipper to the
Smithsonian.")
Sinatra married Mia Farrow
and subsequently Barbara Marx.
He almost drowned in Hawaii,
in 1964.
His son was kidnapped and re
turned safely in 1963.
The lights dropped and only
one spotlight was left on his face.
Smoke rings from his cigarette
bent around the microphone.

Frank Sinatra
A sold-out Circle Star Theatre
crowd of middle-aged bobby
soxers let out a roar as Frank
Sinatra bounded youthfully to
the stage and sang a disco ver
sion of "All or Nothing At All."
Yes, hi s eyes are still very blue.
Frank Sinatra is 61 years old.
He was discovered in a small
New Jersey nightclub in 1939,
where he was working as a sing
ing head-waiter, by big-band
leader Harry James. He origi
nally recorded "All or Nothing
At All" that year with James.
* * *
His voice has aged. He sang
"My Funny Valentine," to a loud
ovation of fans who were either
unaware of or, more likely, un
concerned with the fact that he
screeched at the high notes of the
bridge.
I have determined, upon hear
ing a host of idle comments, that
no celebrity has a worse reputa
tion among young people than
Frank Sinatra (save Richard Ni
xon). A young person's picture:
he's a gangster, he's in the Mafia,
he owns half of Las Vegas, he
hates the press, he's punched
out several reporters, he's been
banned from a lot of countries,
he's a reactionary, he's good
friends with Nixon and Agnew,
his music is dull.
Sinatra sang "I Write the
Songs" and forgot the lyrics.
Example: "I sing the songs that
made ka da da da sing." That's
okay. The Beatles did it too.
Imagine you have never heard
of Frank Sinatra. You go to
someone's house and the person
is playing the album One More
For the Road. (It was very im
portant to Sinatra to make the
group of songs on an album have

an overall meaning.) The first
song is "Come Fly With Me."
Perhaps the style isn't appealing
to you, but you can't ignore The
Voice. Sinatra sings like a trom
bone; a trombone played by
Tommy Dorsey.
Dorsey was the god of the
big-band leaders in the late '30s
and '40s, but more than that, his
tone on the trombone was like
liquid glass; smooth, flowing,
and cool. He played ballads with
unfaultering vibrato and up
tempo jazz with rakish confi
dence and brassy punch.
It was with Dorsey's band,
who outbid Harry James in 1940,
that Sinatra learned to sing. He
listened night after night to Dor
sey's playing and finally trans
lated the style from trombone to
voice. He especially emulated
Dorsey's lyric phrasing and the
technique of breathing through
the notes.
Sinatra sings songs like he
means them. The words create a
feeling of casual conversation
with a friend as he bends the
melody and slides to and from
the notes. It's the Sinatra mood.
★ * *
He sang a few songs I was un
familiar with ("Where or When"
and"I Love My Wife") and then
the orchestra began a famous
Nelson Riddle arrangement. It
was "For Once in My Life," and
the old Sinatra was back. He
warmed up, finally, and began to
swing with typical Sinatra body
language: dance steps and leaps,
directions for the orchestra, and
poses for pretty photographers.
Sinatra broke with Dorsey in a
daring and dangerous move, in
1942, to set out on a soio career.
He made it. On Columbus Day,
1944, 30,000 bobby-soxers

rioted at the Paramount Theatre
in Times Square. (Swooning
didn't start with Elvis or the Bea
tles.) In one of his biographies,
Sinatra explains the reaction:
"Perfectly simple; it was the war
years and there was a great lonel
iness, and I was the boy in every
corner drug-store, the boy who'd
gone off drafted to the war.
That's all."

He sang "My Kind of To wn," a
Sinatra classic from the early
'60s. With a drink in one hand,
he stood still in the center of the
revolving stage, and belted out
the tune just like the record. He
received a standing ovation.
Sinatra never performs or re
cords before 8 p.m. He wi 11 often
drag the whole orchestra and
technical crew out at 3 a.m. to

rehearse. Between songs he fills
with one-liners and additional
anecdotes. "Did you know Alex
Haley was adopted?" Earlier in
the day, he had thrown out the
first basebal 1 at the Giants' Open
ing Day."I haven't been outside
since I was eleven."
The late '40s: Sinatra got in a
fight with an entertainment col
umnist which led to a lawsuit

and much undue harassment
from the press (which was to
continue forever); he started a
career in the movies and was less
than a box office hit; he had seri
ous marital troubles with his
first wife Nancy; Columbia Re
cords' Mitch Miller wanted
Sinatra to record gimicky songs
which were becoming a fad;
Sinatra broke with Columbia; his
CBS television program failed;
he lost his voice.
Comeback: Sinatra married
Ava Gardner and flew to Africa
with her where she was filming a
movie (he had no job). In 1953,
he flew back to Hollywood and
talked Columbia Pictures into
letting him play "Maggio" in
"From Here To Eternity." He
won an Oscar for Best Support
ing Actor. Sinatra was suddenly
in great demand again and the
money came rolling in. He began
to build a kingdom around the
Sands Hotel in Las Vegas.
* * *
He sang "Sorry Seems to Be
the Hardest Word" by Elton John
and Barry Manilow's "See the
Show Again." Both failed to
convey any mood. Next, Sinatra
lurched into a disco version of
Cole Porter's "Night and Day,"
one of the earliest Sinatra clas
sics. It almost made me ill.
Capitol Records recorded
Sinatra during most of the '50s,
but he became disenchanted
with them and formed his own
company, Reprise Records, in
1961. New arrangers included
Count Basie and Quincy Jones.
Bing Crosby, Dean Martin,
Sammy Davis, Jr. all signed with
Reprise.
The press was continually
concerned with Sinatra and his
women. It's impossible to tell a

fact from a rumor unleashed by a
vindictive reporter. (Dean Mar
tin said, "When Sinatra dies
they're giving his zipper to the
Smithsonian.")
Sinatra married Mia Farrow
and subsequently Barbara Marx.
He almost drowned in Hawaii,
in 1964.
His son was kidnapped and re
turned safely in 1963.
The lights dropped and only
one spotlight was left on his face.
Smoke rings from his cigarette
bent around the microphone.
His lips parted and he slid into
"Send in the Clowns," his
post-Nixon hit. When he paused
at the end of a phrase the audi
ence seemed to hold its breath.
Sinatra's business endeavors
in Nevada (he owned North
Shore Tahoe's Cal-Neva Lodge
for a time) coupled with frequent
trips to Havana, caused him to be
linked to the Mafia by many re
porters. He always denied any
connection. Politically, he was
good friends with President
Kennedy and campaigned heav
ily for him. In later years, he has
been seen with Reagan, Agnew
and Nixon.
Sinatra's generosity began
early and never ended. He paid
for whole tours out of his pocket
to raise money for charities.
Handicapped children, Jerry
Lewis' Telethon, and Israel were
the most popular. During the
Gary, Indiana race riots in 1946,
he spoke at high schools that re
fused to admit blacks.
