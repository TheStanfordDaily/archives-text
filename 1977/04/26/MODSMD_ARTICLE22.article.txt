## 'Bullshot' dazzles 
### 
Bullshot Crummond is a play
to be seen, if only to witness the
extraordinary things Mark
Blankfield can do with his face. I
personally all but fell in love
with Blankfield and his protrud
ing walleyes, but other reactions
were in evidence all around me
last Saturday night at the Hip
podrome Theatre on Broadway
in San Francisco. Shrieks, chor
tles and guffaws were some of
the more unrefined audience tri
butes to the satire's split-second
timing and brilliant repartee.
Bullshot parodies an old
British detective series whose
hero was called Bulldog Drum
mond. This I discovered by read
ing one of the more worshipful
reviews posted outside the thea
ter. It isn't essential to an under
standing of the plot.
Moreover, understanding the
plot isn't essential at all. It's a
quite simple, beat-the-nasty-
Germans and rescue-the
drooling blonde affair. This
leaves one free to concentrate en
tirely on the acting, script and
special effects—a welcome op
portunity, since by themselves
they demand such rapt attention
that the 15-minute intermission
seemed ages longer than the two
one-hour acts.
Cab Covay portrays Bullshot
as a skillful mix of the deadpan
and the ridiculous.
John Achorn, as his arch-rival,
Otto Von Brunno, is enthralling,
most notably in one scene in
volving a backdrop and four
under-three-second costume
changes. While Otto carries on a
conversation with Scalerioni, a
would-be hired killer, the audi
ence is left guessing until the last
minute if Achorn really is play
ing both characters. He is, of
course, but he does not betray
himself even by a bit of
gangsterish material protruding
from under his Brunno dressing
gown.
Brandis Kemp, as Rosemary,
was similarly skillful as a foggy,
lisping floozy whose unique
quality of lascivious naivete was

one of the more original bits.
Blankfield undoubtedly
stole the otherwise unstealable
show. He plays a total of seven
parts —from a painfully proper
British waiter at the "Cahrltahn"
tearoom to a hunchback named
Marovich—all of which are en
tirely different, yet all of which
share the ability to raise their
right eyebrow to astonishing
heights. But the supreme mo
ment (more like two moments)
came when, as Marovich,
Blankfield struck his entire hand
inside his ear.
Bullshot Crummond is writ
ten, produced and performed by
its cast. I'm not ashamed to
admit I couldn't find one thing to
criticize in the production. But
in my raving I've saved what
was, for me, the play's most en
dearing quality, until the last.
By means of its remarkable
comic agility, dazzling effects —
from puppetry to light shows—
and, above all, its unique imagi
nation, Bullshot succeeds in a
task which has hitherto caused
strong men to weep. Through its
parody, funny enough in itself,
Bullshot actually patronizes the
British.

last Saturday night at the Hip
podrome Theatre on Broadway
in San Francisco. Shrieks, chor
tles and guffaws were some of
the more unrefined audience tri
butes to the satire's split-second
timing and brilliant repartee.
Bullshot parodies an old
British detective series whose
hero was called Bulldog Drum
mond. This I discovered by read
ing one of the more worshipful
reviews posted outside the thea
ter. It isn't essential to an under
standing of the plot.
Moreover, understanding the
plot isn't essential at all. It's a
quite simple, beat-the-nasty-
Germans and rescue-the
drooling blonde affair. This
leaves one free to concentrate en
tirely on the acting, script and
special effects—a welcome op
portunity, since by themselves
they demand such rapt attention
that the 15-minute intermission
seemed ages longer than the two
one-hour acts.
Cab Covay portrays Bullshot
as a skillful mix of the deadpan
and the ridiculous.
John Achorn, as his arch-rival,
Otto Von Brunno, is enthralling,
most notably in one scene in
volving a backdrop and four
under-three-second costume
changes. While Otto carries on a
conversation with Scalerioni, a
would-be hired killer, the audi
ence is left guessing until the last
minute if Achorn really is play
ing both characters. He is, of
course, but he does not betray
himself even by a bit of
gangsterish material protruding
from under his Brunno dressing
gown.
Brandis Kemp, as Rosemary,
was similarly skillful as a foggy,
lisping floozy whose unique
quality of lascivious naivete was

one of the more original bits.
Blankfield undoubtedly
stole the otherwise unstealable
show. He plays a total of seven
parts —from a painfully proper
British waiter at the "Cahrltahn"
tearoom to a hunchback named
Marovich—all of which are en
tirely different, yet all of which
share the ability to raise their
right eyebrow to astonishing
heights. But the supreme mo
ment (more like two moments)
came when, as Marovich,
Blankfield struck his entire hand
inside his ear.
Bullshot Crummond is writ
ten, produced and performed by
its cast. I'm not ashamed to
admit I couldn't find one thing to
criticize in the production. But
in my raving I've saved what
was, for me, the play's most en
dearing quality, until the last.
By means of its remarkable
comic agility, dazzling effects —
from puppetry to light shows—
and, above all, its unique imagi
nation, Bullshot succeeds in a
task which has hitherto caused
strong men to weep. Through its
parody, funny enough in itself,
Bullshot actually patronizes the
British.
Bullshot Crummond is a play
to be seen, if only to witness the
extraordinary things Mark
Blankfield can do with his face. I
personally all but fell in love
with Blankfield and his protrud
ing walleyes, but other reactions
were in evidence all around me
