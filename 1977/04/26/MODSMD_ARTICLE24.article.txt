## Spring Opera produces pleasant variety 
### 
The Spring Opera is a San
Francisco tradition. Presenting
popular opera in English at
popular prices in the relatively
intimate Curran Theater, this
company provides good enter
tainment as well as good opera.
The Spring Opera achieves out
standing results with simple
sets, a small orchestra, and
young singers.
Four operas are presented this
season. Bizet's Carmen and
Donizetti's Viva la Mama are
sold out, although rush tickets
may be purchased for $3. I at
tended opening night of the
other two — Mozart's Titus and a
triple bill of three one-act operas:
Monteverdi's The Combat, Gus
tav Hoist's Savitri, and
Ullmann's The Emperor of At
lantis.
The three works of the triple
bill complimented each other
well — all pictured death as a
compassionate figure. Because
its history is one of the most un
usual in operatic history, the
audience especially anticipated
the American premiere of The
Emperor of Atlantis.
Prison camp composition
In 1941, the Nazis created a
concentration camp at There
sienstadt as a model institution
to offset rumors of brutality and
to house prisoners with interna
tional connections. As a result,
the camp accumulated tremend
ous artistic and cultural talent.
Fine conductors, performers and
composers interned there pro
duced excellent performances of
the standard repetoire, as well as
forays into theatre and cabaret.
The Nazis encouraged these
performances and often invited
dignitaries.
While at the camp, two in
mates — Victor Ullmann and
Paul Klein — decided to com
pose an opera, writing the music
and the libretto respectively.
However, when complete, SS
censors found the thinly dis
guised allegory too sensitive and
banned it. Klein and Ullmann
were later sent to Auschwitz,
where they perished in 1944.
The opera was recently disco
vered by Kenny Woodward (who
conducts the production) and
has received rave reviews in
Europe.
It is the story of an empire in
which Death, portrayed as a be
nevolent gentleman, becomes
disgusted with modern life and
decides to quit his job. No one
dies. Immortality is a bittersweet
gift, for it sentences man to suffer
eternally in the modern world.
The Emperor tries to convince
his people to use their immortal
ity to embark on world conquest,
but they are not fooled and the
country becomes chaotic. The
Emperor pleads with Death to re
turn but he agrees to do so only if
the Emperor will he the first vic
tim. The Emperor accepts his
death, and order is restored.
The plot is laced with allegor
ical references to the Nazi re
gime, delivered with bitter irony
and grim humor. Death, the

hero, is a sage who sees th>3 value
of human brotherhood.
Original score
The music is exceptionally
moving. Employing 14 instru
ments, including saxophone and
banjo, it is a strikingly original
score. The style can only be de
scribed as a synthesis of Kurt
Weill and Gian-Carlo Me notti (in
their less lyric moments] 1 , mixed
with a dose of grim introspec
tion.
The singing in the Spring
Opera production was of high
quality, especially the ironic,
mocking voice of William
Dansby (Death). Effective stag
ing (a concentration camp lit
with bare lightbulbs), approp
riate costuming (Death in a black
visored cap and a long frock
coat) and Woodward's incisive
baton added to a memor able per
formance.
I'm sure this work v/ill be a
great success on the East Coast

and will become a favorite of col
lege groups. The audience at this
American premiere responded
enthusiastically. They were
applauding more than a good
performance.
Death in India
Gustav Hoist's Savitri (1908)
is a product of his fascination
with India. It portrays the
triumph of a woman defying
Death, who has come to take her
husband. Death, as in The Em
peror, is a compassionate figure.
Savitri is a warm mystical
work, with a truly enchanting
score. Indian motifs swirl
around chromatic vocal pas
sages, matching the simple but
stunning sets. Several multi
colored curtains, sweeping
down in gentle curves, form the
stylized room where the action
takes place. The effect is radiant
and profoundly Indian, while
lighting effects allow Death to

disappear mysteriously.
Lorna Meyers has a rich full
voice, conveying Savitri's
warm-blooded love of life. James
Courtney suffered from intona
tion problems in the difficult
chromatic passages, but his
natural sonority created a noble
image of Death. Satvayan, sung
by John Duhykers, failed to
handle the high tenor part
adequately, but acted with con
vincing naivete.
Anonymous combat
Monteverdi's The Combat
(1624) is a relic from the dawn of
operatic history. However, de
spite its age, it is a charming lit
tle work. The plot chronicles the
story of two lovers who meet
anonymously in mortal combat.
(Once again, death is compas
sionate.)
The work is not as inspired as
some of the composer's major
operas, but the highly descrip
tive score is gently moving. Ken

Remo, as Testo the narrator,
complimented Monteverdi's
music with a light and agile
tenor voice, managing the coun
tertenor part through liberal use
of falsetto.
Rare Mozart
Despite the composer's fame,
Mozart's final opera — La
Clemenza di Tito — is rarely
seen nowadays. The reasons are
obvious: an insipid plot (tragedy
without death or an antagonist),-
repetitive and unimaginative
lyrics; and lengthy, mundane
secco recitative.
The plot revolves around
Titus, a Roman emperor. Several
of his subjects, who also happen
to be his best friends, try to kill
him. He pardons the traitors
with a plea for humanity to the
audience: "Must we resort to
violence?" Only in the modern
age have playwrights been able
to make a single moral decision
into a two-act work, and the 18th
century conception seems trite
by our standards. It is worth
while to note, however, that
Titus was a great success for a
century after Mozart's death.
Rush job
Opera seria was a dead form in
Mozart's day, because of stolid
lyrics and music. This rush job
(Mozart was handed a libretto
and given two weeks to write the
opera) hardly resurrected the old
form — a job which had to be left
to Verdi and Wagner. Only the
finale of the first act and the two
arias accompanied by clarinet
(which remind one immediately
of,the Clarinet Concerto) show
any originality.
The Spring Opera attempts to
dodge the soporific recitatives
by eliminating them and adding
a set of actors borrowed from
ACT. Two parallel productions
on the same stage: the singers
perform in modern dress, while
costumed actors bridge the arias
together. The program notes as
sert that the two groups, who oc
casionally act simultaneously,
display the universal import of
the plot; but si nee the si ngers are
convincing actors, the members
of ACT are unnecessary — in
deed, a distraction.
Fine vocalists save the pro
duction. Carol Vaness (Vitellia)
has a powerful, exciting voice,
although it occasionally escapes
the confines of classic style,
Brenda Boozer (Sextus) is the
star of the show; a bright, sharp
voice which tackled the colorat
ura part with ease.
Only Vincenzo Manno as
Titus was a disappointment. Al
though a convincing actor and
possessed of considerable stage
presence, his voice is poor. The
high notes are bellowed, with
out form or intonation.
I enjoyed Titus but I don't re
commend it for inexperienced
listeners. Catch the triple bill in
stead.
Titus will be repeated Thurs
day, April 28; the triple bill will
be presented Sunday, April 30
and Friday, May 6. All perfor
mances are at 8 p.m. at the Cur
ran Theater, San Francisco.

Quasimodic
Mark Blankfield plays the hunchback Marovich, as well as six
other characters, in a production of Bullshot Crummond at the
Hippodrome Theatre in San Francisco.
The Spring Opera is a San
Francisco tradition. Presenting
popular opera in English at
popular prices in the relatively
intimate Curran Theater, this
company provides good enter
tainment as well as good opera.
The Spring Opera achieves out
standing results with simple
sets, a small orchestra, and
young singers.
Four operas are presented this
season. Bizet's Carmen and
Donizetti's Viva la Mama are
sold out, although rush tickets
may be purchased for $3. I at
tended opening night of the
other two — Mozart's Titus and a
triple bill of three one-act operas:
Monteverdi's The Combat, Gus
tav Hoist's Savitri, and
Ullmann's The Emperor of At
lantis.
The three works of the triple
bill complimented each other
well — all pictured death as a
compassionate figure. Because
its history is one of the most un
usual in operatic history, the
audience especially anticipated
the American premiere of The
Emperor of Atlantis.
Prison camp composition
In 1941, the Nazis created a
concentration camp at There
sienstadt as a model institution
to offset rumors of brutality and
to house prisoners with interna
tional connections. As a result,
the camp accumulated tremend
ous artistic and cultural talent.
Fine conductors, performers and
composers interned there pro
duced excellent performances of
the standard repetoire, as well as
forays into theatre and cabaret.
The Nazis encouraged these
performances and often invited
dignitaries.
While at the camp, two in
mates — Victor Ullmann and
Paul Klein — decided to com
pose an opera, writing the music
and the libretto respectively.
However, when complete, SS
censors found the thinly dis
guised allegory too sensitive and
banned it. Klein and Ullmann
were later sent to Auschwitz,
where they perished in 1944.
The opera was recently disco
vered by Kenny Woodward (who
conducts the production) and
has received rave reviews in
Europe.
It is the story of an empire in
which Death, portrayed as a be
nevolent gentleman, becomes
disgusted with modern life and
decides to quit his job. No one
dies. Immortality is a bittersweet
gift, for it sentences man to suffer
eternally in the modern world.
The Emperor tries to convince
his people to use their immortal
ity to embark on world conquest,
but they are not fooled and the
country becomes chaotic. The
Emperor pleads with Death to re
turn but he agrees to do so only if
the Emperor will he the first vic
tim. The Emperor accepts his
death, and order is restored.
The plot is laced with allegor
ical references to the Nazi re
gime, delivered with bitter irony
and grim humor. Death, the

hero, is a sage who sees th>3 value
of human brotherhood.
Original score
The music is exceptionally
moving. Employing 14 instru
ments, including saxophone and
banjo, it is a strikingly original
score. The style can only be de
scribed as a synthesis of Kurt
Weill and Gian-Carlo Me notti (in
their less lyric moments] 1 , mixed
with a dose of grim introspec
tion.
The singing in the Spring
Opera production was of high
quality, especially the ironic,
mocking voice of William
Dansby (Death). Effective stag
ing (a concentration camp lit
with bare lightbulbs), approp
riate costuming (Death in a black
visored cap and a long frock
coat) and Woodward's incisive
baton added to a memor able per
formance.
I'm sure this work v/ill be a
great success on the East Coast

and will become a favorite of col
lege groups. The audience at this
American premiere responded
enthusiastically. They were
applauding more than a good
performance.
Death in India
Gustav Hoist's Savitri (1908)
is a product of his fascination
with India. It portrays the
triumph of a woman defying
Death, who has come to take her
husband. Death, as in The Em
peror, is a compassionate figure.
Savitri is a warm mystical
work, with a truly enchanting
score. Indian motifs swirl
around chromatic vocal pas
sages, matching the simple but
stunning sets. Several multi
colored curtains, sweeping
down in gentle curves, form the
stylized room where the action
takes place. The effect is radiant
and profoundly Indian, while
lighting effects allow Death to

disappear mysteriously.
Lorna Meyers has a rich full
voice, conveying Savitri's
warm-blooded love of life. James
Courtney suffered from intona
tion problems in the difficult
chromatic passages, but his
natural sonority created a noble
image of Death. Satvayan, sung
by John Duhykers, failed to
handle the high tenor part
adequately, but acted with con
vincing naivete.
Anonymous combat
Monteverdi's The Combat
(1624) is a relic from the dawn of
operatic history. However, de
spite its age, it is a charming lit
tle work. The plot chronicles the
story of two lovers who meet
anonymously in mortal combat.
(Once again, death is compas
sionate.)
The work is not as inspired as
some of the composer's major
operas, but the highly descrip
tive score is gently moving. Ken

Remo, as Testo the narrator,
complimented Monteverdi's
music with a light and agile
tenor voice, managing the coun
tertenor part through liberal use
of falsetto.
Rare Mozart
Despite the composer's fame,
Mozart's final opera — La
Clemenza di Tito — is rarely
seen nowadays. The reasons are
obvious: an insipid plot (tragedy
without death or an antagonist),-
repetitive and unimaginative
lyrics; and lengthy, mundane
secco recitative.
The plot revolves around
Titus, a Roman emperor. Several
of his subjects, who also happen
to be his best friends, try to kill
him. He pardons the traitors
with a plea for humanity to the
audience: "Must we resort to
violence?" Only in the modern
age have playwrights been able
to make a single moral decision
into a two-act work, and the 18th
century conception seems trite
by our standards. It is worth
while to note, however, that
Titus was a great success for a
century after Mozart's death.
Rush job
Opera seria was a dead form in
Mozart's day, because of stolid
lyrics and music. This rush job
(Mozart was handed a libretto
and given two weeks to write the
opera) hardly resurrected the old
form — a job which had to be left
to Verdi and Wagner. Only the
finale of the first act and the two
arias accompanied by clarinet
(which remind one immediately
of,the Clarinet Concerto) show
any originality.
The Spring Opera attempts to
dodge the soporific recitatives
by eliminating them and adding
a set of actors borrowed from
ACT. Two parallel productions

perform in modern dress, while
costumed actors bridge the arias
together. The program notes as

Anonymous combat
Monteverdi's The Combat
(1624) is a relic from the dawn of
operatic history. However, de
spite its age, it is a charming lit
tle work. The plot chronicles the
story of two lovers who meet
anonymously in mortal combat.
(Once again, death is compas
sionate.)
The work is not as inspired as
some of the composer's major
operas, but the highly descrip

Remo, as Testo the narrator,
complimented Monteverdi's
music with a light and agile
tenor voice, managing the coun
tertenor part through liberal use
of falsetto.
Rare Mozart
Despite the composer's fame,
Mozart's final opera — La
Clemenza di Tito — is rarely
seen nowadays. The reasons are
obvious: an insipid plot (tragedy
without death or an antagonist),-
repetitive and unimaginative
lyrics; and lengthy, mundane
secco recitative.
The plot revolves around
Titus, a Roman emperor. Several
of his subjects, who also happen
to be his best friends, try to kill
him. He pardons the traitors
with a plea for humanity to the
audience: "Must we resort to
violence?" Only in the modern
age have playwrights been able
to make a single moral decision
into a two-act work, and the 18th
century conception seems trite
by our standards. It is worth
while to note, however, that
Titus was a great success for a
century after Mozart's death.
Rush job
Opera seria was a dead form in
Mozart's day, because of stolid
lyrics and music. This rush job
(Mozart was handed a libretto
and given two weeks to write the
opera) hardly resurrected the old
form — a job which had to be left
to Verdi and Wagner. Only the
finale of the first act and the two
arias accompanied by clarinet
(which remind one immediately
of,the Clarinet Concerto) show
any originality.
The Spring Opera attempts to
dodge the soporific recitatives
by eliminating them and adding
a set of actors borrowed from
ACT. Two parallel productions
on the same stage: the singers
perform in modern dress, while
costumed actors bridge the arias
together. The program notes as
sert that the two groups, who oc
casionally act simultaneously,
display the universal import of
the plot; but si nee the si ngers are
convincing actors, the members
of ACT are unnecessary — in
deed, a distraction.
Fine vocalists save the pro
duction. Carol Vaness (Vitellia)
has a powerful, exciting voice,
although it occasionally escapes
the confines of classic style,
Brenda Boozer (Sextus) is the
star of the show; a bright, sharp
voice which tackled the colorat
ura part with ease.
Only Vincenzo Manno as
Titus was a disappointment. Al
though a convincing actor and
possessed of considerable stage

I enjoyed Titus but I don't re

Hippodrome Theatre in San Francisco.
The Spring Opera is a San

popular opera in English at
popular prices in the relatively
intimate Curran Theater, this
company provides good enter
tainment as well as good opera.
The Spring Opera achieves out
standing results with simple
sets, a small orchestra, and
young singers.
Four operas are presented this
season. Bizet's Carmen and
Donizetti's Viva la Mama are
sold out, although rush tickets
may be purchased for $3. I at
tended opening night of the
other two — Mozart's Titus and a
triple bill of three one-act operas:
Monteverdi's The Combat, Gus
tav Hoist's Savitri, and
Ullmann's The Emperor of At
lantis.
The three works of the triple
bill complimented each other
well — all pictured death as a
compassionate figure. Because
its history is one of the most un
usual in operatic history, the
audience especially anticipated
the American premiere of The
Emperor of Atlantis.
Prison camp composition
In 1941, the Nazis created a
concentration camp at There
sienstadt as a model institution
to offset rumors of brutality and
to house prisoners with interna
tional connections. As a result,
the camp accumulated tremend
ous artistic and cultural talent.
Fine conductors, performers and
composers interned there pro
duced excellent performances of
the standard repetoire, as well as
forays into theatre and cabaret.
The Nazis encouraged these
performances and often invited
dignitaries.
While at the camp, two in
mates — Victor Ullmann and
Paul Klein — decided to com
pose an opera, writing the music
and the libretto respectively.
However, when complete, SS
censors found the thinly dis
guised allegory too sensitive and
banned it. Klein and Ullmann
were later sent to Auschwitz,
where they perished in 1944.
The opera was recently disco
vered by Kenny Woodward (who
conducts the production) and
has received rave reviews in
Europe.
It is the story of an empire in
which Death, portrayed as a be
nevolent gentleman, becomes
disgusted with modern life and
decides to quit his job. No one
dies. Immortality is a bittersweet
gift, for it sentences man to suffer
eternally in the modern world.
The Emperor tries to convince
his people to use their immortal
ity to embark on world conquest,
but they are not fooled and the
country becomes chaotic. The
Emperor pleads with Death to re
turn but he agrees to do so only if
the Emperor will he the first vic
tim. The Emperor accepts his
death, and order is restored.
The plot is laced with allegor
ical references to the Nazi re
gime, delivered with bitter irony
and grim humor. Death, the

hero, is a sage who sees th>3 value
of human brotherhood.
Original score
The music is exceptionally
moving. Employing 14 instru
ments, including saxophone and
banjo, it is a strikingly original
score. The style can only be de
scribed as a synthesis of Kurt
Weill and Gian-Carlo Me notti (in
their less lyric moments] 1 , mixed
with a dose of grim introspec
tion.
The singing in the Spring
Opera production was of high
quality, especially the ironic,
mocking voice of William
Dansby (Death). Effective stag
ing (a concentration camp lit
with bare lightbulbs), approp
riate costuming (Death in a black
visored cap and a long frock
coat) and Woodward's incisive
baton added to a memor able per
formance.
I'm sure this work v/ill be a
great success on the East Coast

and will become a favorite of col
lege groups. The audience at this
American premiere responded
enthusiastically. They were
applauding more than a good
performance.
Death in India
Gustav Hoist's Savitri (1908)
is a product of his fascination
with India. It portrays the
triumph of a woman defying
Death, who has come to take her
husband. Death, as in The Em
peror, is a compassionate figure.
Savitri is a warm mystical
work, with a truly enchanting
score. Indian motifs swirl
around chromatic vocal pas
sages, matching the simple but
stunning sets. Several multi
colored curtains, sweeping
down in gentle curves, form the
stylized room where the action
takes place. The effect is radiant
and profoundly Indian, while
lighting effects allow Death to

disappear mysteriously.
Lorna Meyers has a rich full
voice, conveying Savitri's
warm-blooded love of life. James
Courtney suffered from intona
tion problems in the difficult
chromatic passages, but his
natural sonority created a noble
image of Death. Satvayan, sung
by John Duhykers, failed to
handle the high tenor part
adequately, but acted with con

scribed as a synthesis of Kurt
Weill and Gian-Carlo Me notti (in
their less lyric moments] 1 , mixed
with a dose of grim introspec
tion.
The singing in the Spring
Opera production was of high
quality, especially the ironic,
mocking voice of William
Dansby (Death). Effective stag
ing (a concentration camp lit
with bare lightbulbs), approp
riate costuming (Death in a black
visored cap and a long frock
coat) and Woodward's incisive
baton added to a memor able per
formance.
I'm sure this work v/ill be a
great success on the East Coast

and will become a favorite of col
lege groups. The audience at this
American premiere responded
enthusiastically. They were
applauding more than a good
performance.
Death in India
Gustav Hoist's Savitri (1908)
is a product of his fascination
with India. It portrays the
triumph of a woman defying
Death, who has come to take her
husband. Death, as in The Em
peror, is a compassionate figure.
Savitri is a warm mystical
work, with a truly enchanting
score. Indian motifs swirl
around chromatic vocal pas
sages, matching the simple but
stunning sets. Several multi
colored curtains, sweeping
down in gentle curves, form the
stylized room where the action
takes place. The effect is radiant
and profoundly Indian, while
lighting effects allow Death to

disappear mysteriously.
Lorna Meyers has a rich full
voice, conveying Savitri's
warm-blooded love of life. James
Courtney suffered from intona
tion problems in the difficult
chromatic passages, but his
natural sonority created a noble
image of Death. Satvayan, sung
by John Duhykers, failed to
handle the high tenor part
adequately, but acted with con
vincing naivete.
Anonymous combat
Monteverdi's The Combat
(1624) is a relic from the dawn of
operatic history. However, de
spite its age, it is a charming lit
tle work. The plot chronicles the
story of two lovers who meet
anonymously in mortal combat.
(Once again, death is compas
sionate.)
The work is not as inspired as
some of the composer's major
operas, but the highly descrip
tive score is gently moving. Ken

Remo, as Testo the narrator,
complimented Monteverdi's
music with a light and agile
tenor voice, managing the coun
tertenor part through liberal use
of falsetto.
Rare Mozart
Despite the composer's fame,
Mozart's final opera — La
Clemenza di Tito — is rarely
seen nowadays. The reasons are
obvious: an insipid plot (tragedy
without death or an antagonist),-
repetitive and unimaginative
lyrics; and lengthy, mundane
secco recitative.
The plot revolves around
Titus, a Roman emperor. Several
of his subjects, who also happen
to be his best friends, try to kill
him. He pardons the traitors
with a plea for humanity to the
audience: "Must we resort to
violence?" Only in the modern
age have playwrights been able
to make a single moral decision
into a two-act work, and the 18th
century conception seems trite
by our standards. It is worth
while to note, however, that
Titus was a great success for a
century after Mozart's death.
Rush job
Opera seria was a dead form in
Mozart's day, because of stolid
lyrics and music. This rush job
(Mozart was handed a libretto
and given two weeks to write the
opera) hardly resurrected the old
form — a job which had to be left
to Verdi and Wagner. Only the
finale of the first act and the two
arias accompanied by clarinet
(which remind one immediately
of,the Clarinet Concerto) show
any originality.
The Spring Opera attempts to
dodge the soporific recitatives
by eliminating them and adding
a set of actors borrowed from
ACT. Two parallel productions
on the same stage: the singers
perform in modern dress, while
costumed actors bridge the arias
together. The program notes as
sert that the two groups, who oc
casionally act simultaneously,
display the universal import of
the plot; but si nee the si ngers are
convincing actors, the members
of ACT are unnecessary — in
deed, a distraction.
Fine vocalists save the pro
duction. Carol Vaness (Vitellia)
has a powerful, exciting voice,
although it occasionally escapes
the confines of classic style,
Brenda Boozer (Sextus) is the
star of the show; a bright, sharp
voice which tackled the colorat
ura part with ease.
Only Vincenzo Manno as
Titus was a disappointment. Al
though a convincing actor and
possessed of considerable stage
presence, his voice is poor. The
high notes are bellowed, with
out form or intonation.
I enjoyed Titus but I don't re
commend it for inexperienced
listeners. Catch the triple bill in
stead.
Titus will be repeated Thurs
day, April 28; the triple bill will
be presented Sunday, April 30
and Friday, May 6. All perfor
mances are at 8 p.m. at the Cur
ran Theater, San Francisco.

The Spring Opera is a San
Francisco tradition. Presenting
popular opera in English at
popular prices in the relatively
intimate Curran Theater, this
company provides good enter
tainment as well as good opera.
The Spring Opera achieves out
standing results with simple
sets, a small orchestra, and
young singers.
Four operas are presented this
season. Bizet's Carmen and
Donizetti's Viva la Mama are
sold out, although rush tickets
may be purchased for $3. I at
tended opening night of the
other two — Mozart's Titus and a
triple bill of three one-act operas:
Monteverdi's The Combat, Gus
tav Hoist's Savitri, and
Ullmann's The Emperor of At
lantis.
The three works of the triple
bill complimented each other
well — all pictured death as a
compassionate figure. Because
its history is one of the most un
usual in operatic history, the
audience especially anticipated
the American premiere of The
Emperor of Atlantis.
Prison camp composition
In 1941, the Nazis created a
concentration camp at There
sienstadt as a model institution
to offset rumors of brutality and
to house prisoners with interna
tional connections. As a result,
the camp accumulated tremend
ous artistic and cultural talent.
Fine conductors, performers and
composers interned there pro
duced excellent performances of
the standard repetoire, as well as
forays into theatre and cabaret.
The Nazis encouraged these
performances and often invited
dignitaries.
While at the camp, two in
mates — Victor Ullmann and
Paul Klein — decided to com
pose an opera, writing the music
and the libretto respectively.
However, when complete, SS
censors found the thinly dis
guised allegory too sensitive and
banned it. Klein and Ullmann
were later sent to Auschwitz,
where they perished in 1944.
The opera was recently disco
vered by Kenny Woodward (who
conducts the production) and
has received rave reviews in
Europe.
It is the story of an empire in
which Death, portrayed as a be
nevolent gentleman, becomes
disgusted with modern life and
decides to quit his job. No one
dies. Immortality is a bittersweet
gift, for it sentences man to suffer
eternally in the modern world.
The Emperor tries to convince
his people to use their immortal
ity to embark on world conquest,
but they are not fooled and the
country becomes chaotic. The
Emperor pleads with Death to re
turn but he agrees to do so only if
the Emperor will he the first vic
tim. The Emperor accepts his
death, and order is restored.
The plot is laced with allegor
ical references to the Nazi re
gime, delivered with bitter irony
and grim humor. Death, the

hero, is a sage who sees th>3 value
of human brotherhood.
Original score
The music is exceptionally
moving. Employing 14 instru
ments, including saxophone and
banjo, it is a strikingly original
score. The style can only be de
scribed as a synthesis of Kurt
Weill and Gian-Carlo Me notti (in
their less lyric moments] 1 , mixed
with a dose of grim introspec
tion.
The singing in the Spring
Opera production was of high
