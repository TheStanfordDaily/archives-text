# Symphony/ted libbey
## Russian program lackluster 
### 
Two works from the Russian repertoire were
performed by the San Francisco Symphony the
week before last under th e direction of guest con
ductor Kazimierz Kord. In the first of them,
Tchaikovsky's durable Piano Concerto No. 1 in
B-flat minor, French pianist Jean-Bernard Pom
mier was featured as soloist.
The performance provec 1 to be a lackluster affair.
A tentative entrance by t he horn section in the
opening bar set the trajectory for the entire move
ment â€” playing in all sect ions sank to the level of
shapeless routine with only the slightest sense of
profile to relieve the tedium.
The strings were major offenders throughout,
failing repeatedly to produce the generous tone for
which the music calls.
Interestingly, tone was the one resource which
pianist Pommier had in steady supply. But his
articulation often verged on the frenetic, with
wholesale faking and an abundance of wrong
notes. >
Tchaikovsky gives the piano free rein in this
concerto, placing its first flight of soloistic fantasy
only a few bars after the initial statement of the
opening subject. Pommier's rocky treatment of the
passage, probably the result of opening night
nerves, left many in the audience incredulous.
Fortunately, he recovered his poise in subsequent
solos, although his playing was far more effective
in the movement's lyrical pages than in its furious
climaxes, which he had a tendency to shamelessly
showboat.
The performance as a w hole went flat before the
cadenza, and neither Kord nor Pommier could re
vive it until the final few bars of the first move
ment.
Everything in place
With the second movement, however, the two
were far more successful. Everything was in place,
and, since there was no temptation to overstate,
Pommier shaped his phrases effectively, with
playing that was clear, light, and accurate.
In the concerto's finale the orchestra showed
itself once again to bo short on intensity. The
strings were still not putting themselves into the
music, and Kord contributed very little from the
podium, even missing a change in tempo near the
beginning of the movement.
Pommier, on the other hand, after having settled
down in the andante, tossed off the solo with ap
lomb. This time, everything he did worked, in
cluding the parallel octaves which had been his
undoing in the tirst movement.
The orchestra, with unfail ing i nsti net for the end

of a piece, came alive in the final 30 seconds,
giving the coda the kind of treatment the whole
concerto deserved.
The second work on the program, Symphony
No. 10 in E minor Dmitri Shostakovitch, brought a
change for the better, though not the best.
From beginning to end the orchestra was more
involved than it had been in the Tchaikovsky. The
strings, in particular, made an effort to impart
weight and fulness of sonority to the music, which
dwells in darkness for three quarters of an hour
before emerging into the light at the end of the
finale.
Ominous exordium
The first movement, described as "an ominous E
minor exordium" by one critic, is nearly equal in
length to the remaining three movements com
bined. It was particularly well-played in Wednes
day's performance, and proved to be the high point
of the evening. Kord's conducting wasforceful and
incisive, eliciting an exceptional intensity of
sound from the orchestra. The brass, which had
failed to do anything remarkable in the
Tchaikovsky, obtained momentary splendor with
fine playing in the movement's impassioned
climaxes.
There was a falling-off, however, in the remain
ing movements of the piece. Kord seemed less than
fullv in command during the scherzo.
The third movement, an allegretto that owes
much to Mahler, was marred by an inadequate
performance from the solo horn, whose attacks
were consistently mushy in pianissimo. Kord,
however, had a better grasp of this movement, and
succeeded in bringing out its striking changes of
character without losing its momentum. The end
ing was particularly well-staged.
Oboist Mark Lifschey uncorked the solo of the
evening during the slow introduction to the fourth
movement, and his playing proved infectious to
the rest of the wind section. The violins attempted
to follow suit in the ensuing allegro, but were
hindered by some initial slips. They regained their
bearings in time for some excellent scales in mea
sured tremolo, and held themselves together
through the rest of the movement. Distressingly
uneven throughout the concert, the brass re
mained true to form by starting off well and getting
completely out of hand by the end.
As he had in the Scherzo, Kord seemed to be
overly timid in his approach to the music. Instead
of transcendence he achieved a colorless gaiety in
the finale that relinquished the work's hold on the
audience rather than strengthening it.
