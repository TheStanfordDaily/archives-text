Hussein visits Carter for talks
Washington — king Hussein of Jordan, who
has been cautious in discussing prospects for a
Middle East peace, told President Jimmy Carter
last night he feels "more encouraged and more
hopeful than 1 have for a long time" as a result of
talks at the White House.
During their first meeting earlier yesterday.
Carter and Hussein discussed possible ways of
admitting the Palestinians to Arab-Israeli negoti
ations.
There was no public mention of the Palestinian
issue, which in some ways is as troubling to I lus
sein as it is to the Israelis.
He fought a bloody war with Palestinian com
mandos in 1970 and 1971. Palestinian demands
for statehood might be fulfilled, with U.S. sup
port, on former Jordanian territory occupied by
Israel.
At a summit meeting of all Arab states in 1974,
representation rights over the Palestinians was
taken from Hussein and given solely to the Pales
tine Liberation Organization.
But since Israel, with the backing of the United
States, refused to deal with Yasir Arafat's group,
the administration and the Arabs have been
scrambling for a way to have the Palestinian view
point expressed at the Ceneva peace confer
ence they hope to reconvene before the end ot the
year.
Israel prefers to deal directly with Hussein,
considering the king to be the most conciliatory
of all Arab leaders.
UC research expenditures audited
Berkeley — University of California faculty
members are being warned to keep close tabs on
how federal research money is spent as a result of
government audits challenging up to $5 million
of university expenditures.
In a report to be presented to the UC-Berkeley
Academic Senate today, UC Business and Fi
nance Vice President John Perkins says there is a
federal auditing crackdown because of a "sig
nificant change in the federal-university rela
tionship."
The nine-campus UC system gets about $250
million for some 8000 federal projects, said uni
versity spokeswoman Sarah Molla.
Earlier this year, the Department of Health,

Education and Weliare, which oversees federal
research, asked UC to return from $4 to $5 million
that HEW said had been improperly accounted
for.
The university is challenging the govern
ment's figures and has been negotiating to re
solve accounting discrepancies.
The final settlement will probably take several
more months, Gross said, adding two areas ot
contention have been resolved.
The government initially found 100 cases
where consultants had been improperly ac
counted for. The final settlement found two cases
of error, with $810 to be returned, Gross said.
The government had said $57,000 was miss
pent for general purpose equipment. The settle
ment called for a return ot $4500, he said.
Gross said the government audited a sample ot
the university's projects and then extrapolated to
get the total figure.
"They can use a sample to determine there's a
problem," Gross said, but not to "establish the
amount we have to repay. This is hard money and
we want hard evidence."
Firefighters battle to control blaze
Yreka — Rain and hail aided weary firefighters
yesterday as they battled to control California's
worst forest fire of the drought-parched year.
The stubborn blaze, which blackened more
than two million board feet of timber on 2200
dust-dry acres about 25 miles northwest ot here,
was expected to be controlled by tonight, a Na
tional Forest Service spokesman said.
Ernie Weinberg said the fire had caused an
estimated $1 million damage to the watershed.
The blaze swept across HHO acres of Klamath
National Forest land and about 1320 acres of pri
vate property, mostly owned by International
Paper Co., he said
The fire started Saturday afternoon on private
land within a half-mile of a road. The specific
cause was still undetermined, but officials said it
appeared to have been man-caused.
The blaze was contained Sunday evening after
crews struggled to dig fire lines around the
perimeter in intense heat spurred by the unsea
sonably dry tinder.
Weinberg said some of the crews had minor
burns, but no serious injuries were reported.

AIM leader ordered extradited
Sacramento - - A state appeals court yesterday
ordered Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. to extradite
American Indian Movement leader Dennis Banks
to South Dakota on a warrant stemming from a
riot-assault conviction.
The Third District Court of Appeals issued its
ruling one week after attorneys for California and
South Dakota e rgued in a hearing over South
Dakota's bid for Bank's return.
Brown's legal affairs secretary, J. Anthony
Kline, said he would strongly urge Brown to ap
peal the ru 1 irig, which he said was unpre
cedented, to the state supreme court.
Banks fled to California after his conviction on
riot and assault with a deadly weapon charges
stemming from a 1973 Cluster County riot at a
courthouse.
The Democr a tic governor's office fought South
Dakota's request for extradition, arguing it was
studying allegations that Banks' life would be in
danger if he returned to South Dakota.
Charles Battles, a Los Angeles attorney who
represented South Dakota at the hearing, said the
court yesterday ordered Brown to issue a gover
nor's warrant "to have Banks arrested and have
him delivered up to South Dakota."
Banks' location was not immediately known.
Battles added that Banks could also fight the
extradition v/arrant once he was arrested. Kline
said the court also noted that its order did not
"end the matter" because Banks could fight it.
School finance bill clears assembly
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown. Jr.'s
five-year, $3-billion school finance bill, which
would narrow the gap between rich and poor
school districts, narrowly cleared the state as
sembly yesterday.

school finance system since the state supreme
court ruled this year that the system discrimi
nated against districts with little taxable wealth.
The 55-2 1 vote, one more than the needed
two-thirds majority, masked considerable oppos
ition to the measure, particularly its effect on
districts with high property wealth and many
poor people,, like San Francisco.
The threi; San Francisco assemblymen, and

several others from the outlying areas, voted for
the bill reluctantly in hopes that the author, As
semblyman Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento), can
persuade Brown to increase the funding.
Assembly Speaker l.eo McCarthy (D-San Fran
cisco), said he voted for it because of a "general
faith" that Greene "is going to find a way to
recognize the problems ot urban districts with a
high concentration of foreign-language students
and kids with special educational problems."

Hussein visits Carter for talks
Washington — king Hussein of Jordan, who
has been cautious in discussing prospects for a
Middle East peace, told President Jimmy Carter
last night he feels "more encouraged and more
hopeful than 1 have for a long time" as a result of
talks at the White House.
During their first meeting earlier yesterday.
Carter and Hussein discussed possible ways of
admitting the Palestinians to Arab-Israeli negoti

There was no public mention of the Palestinian
issue, which in some ways is as troubling to I lus
sein as it is to the Israelis.
He fought a bloody war with Palestinian com
mandos in 1970 and 1971. Palestinian demands
for statehood might be fulfilled, with U.S. sup

Israel.
At a summit meeting of all Arab states in 1974,
representation rights over the Palestinians was
taken from Hussein and given solely to the Pales

But since Israel, with the backing of the United
States, refused to deal with Yasir Arafat's group,
the administration and the Arabs have been

UC research expenditures audited
Berkeley — University of California faculty
members are being warned to keep close tabs on
how federal research money is spent as a result of
government audits challenging up to $5 million
of university expenditures.
In a report to be presented to the UC-Berkeley
Academic Senate today, UC Business and Fi
nance Vice President John Perkins says there is a
federal auditing crackdown because of a "sig
nificant change in the federal-university rela
tionship."
The nine-campus UC system gets about $250
million for some 8000 federal projects, said uni
versity spokeswoman Sarah Molla.
Earlier this year, the Department of Health,

Education and Weliare, which oversees federal
research, asked UC to return from $4 to $5 million
that HEW said had been improperly accounted
for.
The university is challenging the govern
ment's figures and has been negotiating to re
solve accounting discrepancies.
The final settlement will probably take several
more months, Gross said, adding two areas ot
contention have been resolved.
The government initially found 100 cases
where consultants had been improperly ac
counted for. The final settlement found two cases
of error, with $810 to be returned, Gross said.
The government had said $57,000 was miss
pent for general purpose equipment. The settle
ment called for a return ot $4500, he said.
Gross said the government audited a sample ot
the university's projects and then extrapolated to
get the total figure.
"They can use a sample to determine there's a
problem," Gross said, but not to "establish the
amount we have to repay. This is hard money and
we want hard evidence."
Firefighters battle to control blaze
Yreka — Rain and hail aided weary firefighters
yesterday as they battled to control California's
worst forest fire of the drought-parched year.
The stubborn blaze, which blackened more
than two million board feet of timber on 2200
dust-dry acres about 25 miles northwest ot here,
was expected to be controlled by tonight, a Na
tional Forest Service spokesman said.
Ernie Weinberg said the fire had caused an
estimated $1 million damage to the watershed.
The blaze swept across HHO acres of Klamath
National Forest land and about 1320 acres of pri
vate property, mostly owned by International
Paper Co., he said
The fire started Saturday afternoon on private
land within a half-mile of a road. The specific
cause was still undetermined, but officials said it
appeared to have been man-caused.
The blaze was contained Sunday evening after
crews struggled to dig fire lines around the
perimeter in intense heat spurred by the unsea
sonably dry tinder.
Weinberg said some of the crews had minor
burns, but no serious injuries were reported.

AIM leader ordered extradited
Sacramento - - A state appeals court yesterday
ordered Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. to extradite
American Indian Movement leader Dennis Banks
to South Dakota on a warrant stemming from a
riot-assault conviction.
The Third District Court of Appeals issued its
ruling one week after attorneys for California and
South Dakota e rgued in a hearing over South
Dakota's bid for Bank's return.
Brown's legal affairs secretary, J. Anthony
Kline, said he would strongly urge Brown to ap
peal the ru 1 irig, which he said was unpre
cedented, to the state supreme court.
Banks fled to California after his conviction on
riot and assault with a deadly weapon charges
stemming from a 1973 Cluster County riot at a
courthouse.
The Democr a tic governor's office fought South
Dakota's request for extradition, arguing it was
studying allegations that Banks' life would be in
danger if he returned to South Dakota.
Charles Battles, a Los Angeles attorney who
represented South Dakota at the hearing, said the
court yesterday ordered Brown to issue a gover
nor's warrant "to have Banks arrested and have
him delivered up to South Dakota."
Banks' location was not immediately known.
Battles added that Banks could also fight the
extradition v/arrant once he was arrested. Kline
said the court also noted that its order did not
"end the matter" because Banks could fight it.
School finance bill clears assembly
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown. Jr.'s
five-year, $3-billion school finance bill, which
would narrow the gap between rich and poor
school districts, narrowly cleared the state as
sembly yesterday.
It was the first time either house of the legisla
ture had approved a revamping of California's
school finance system since the state supreme
court ruled this year that the system discrimi
nated against districts with little taxable wealth.
The 55-2 1 vote, one more than the needed
two-thirds majority, masked considerable oppos
ition to the measure, particularly its effect on
districts with high property wealth and many
poor people,, like San Francisco.
The threi; San Francisco assemblymen, and

several others from the outlying areas, voted for
the bill reluctantly in hopes that the author, As
semblyman Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento), can
persuade Brown to increase the funding.
Assembly Speaker l.eo McCarthy (D-San Fran
cisco), said he voted for it because of a "general
faith" that Greene "is going to find a way to
recognize the problems ot urban districts with a
high concentration of foreign-language students
and kids with special educational problems."

Hussein visits Carter for talks
Washington — king Hussein of Jordan, who
has been cautious in discussing prospects for a
Middle East peace, told President Jimmy Carter
last night he feels "more encouraged and more
hopeful than 1 have for a long time" as a result of
talks at the White House.
During their first meeting earlier yesterday.
Carter and Hussein discussed possible ways of
admitting the Palestinians to Arab-Israeli negoti

There was no public mention of the Palestinian
issue, which in some ways is as troubling to I lus

He fought a bloody war with Palestinian com

Israel.
At a summit meeting of all Arab states in 1974,
representation rights over the Palestinians was
taken from Hussein and given solely to the Pales

But since Israel, with the backing of the United
States, refused to deal with Yasir Arafat's group,
the administration and the Arabs have been
scrambling for a way to have the Palestinian view
point expressed at the Ceneva peace confer

Israel prefers to deal directly with Hussein,

UC research expenditures audited
Berkeley — University of California faculty
members are being warned to keep close tabs on
how federal research money is spent as a result of
government audits challenging up to $5 million
of university expenditures.
In a report to be presented to the UC-Berkeley
Academic Senate today, UC Business and Fi
nance Vice President John Perkins says there is a
federal auditing crackdown because of a "sig
nificant change in the federal-university rela
tionship."
The nine-campus UC system gets about $250
million for some 8000 federal projects, said uni
versity spokeswoman Sarah Molla.
Earlier this year, the Department of Health,

Education and Weliare, which oversees federal
research, asked UC to return from $4 to $5 million
that HEW said had been improperly accounted
for.
The university is challenging the govern
ment's figures and has been negotiating to re
solve accounting discrepancies.
The final settlement will probably take several
more months, Gross said, adding two areas ot
contention have been resolved.
The government initially found 100 cases
where consultants had been improperly ac
counted for. The final settlement found two cases
of error, with $810 to be returned, Gross said.
The government had said $57,000 was miss
pent for general purpose equipment. The settle
ment called for a return ot $4500, he said.
Gross said the government audited a sample ot
the university's projects and then extrapolated to
get the total figure.
"They can use a sample to determine there's a
problem," Gross said, but not to "establish the
amount we have to repay. This is hard money and
we want hard evidence."
Firefighters battle to control blaze
Yreka — Rain and hail aided weary firefighters
yesterday as they battled to control California's
worst forest fire of the drought-parched year.
The stubborn blaze, which blackened more
than two million board feet of timber on 2200
dust-dry acres about 25 miles northwest ot here,
was expected to be controlled by tonight, a Na
tional Forest Service spokesman said.
Ernie Weinberg said the fire had caused an
estimated $1 million damage to the watershed.
The blaze swept across HHO acres of Klamath
National Forest land and about 1320 acres of pri
vate property, mostly owned by International
Paper Co., he said
The fire started Saturday afternoon on private
land within a half-mile of a road. The specific
cause was still undetermined, but officials said it
appeared to have been man-caused.
The blaze was contained Sunday evening after
crews struggled to dig fire lines around the
perimeter in intense heat spurred by the unsea
sonably dry tinder.
Weinberg said some of the crews had minor
burns, but no serious injuries were reported.

represented South Dakota at the hearing, said the
court yesterday ordered Brown to issue a gover

AIM leader ordered extradited
Sacramento - - A state appeals court yesterday
ordered Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. to extradite
American Indian Movement leader Dennis Banks
to South Dakota on a warrant stemming from a
riot-assault conviction.
The Third District Court of Appeals issued its
ruling one week after attorneys for California and
South Dakota e rgued in a hearing over South
Dakota's bid for Bank's return.
Brown's legal affairs secretary, J. Anthony
Kline, said he would strongly urge Brown to ap
peal the ru 1 irig, which he said was unpre
cedented, to the state supreme court.
Banks fled to California after his conviction on
riot and assault with a deadly weapon charges
stemming from a 1973 Cluster County riot at a
courthouse.
The Democr a tic governor's office fought South
Dakota's request for extradition, arguing it was
studying allegations that Banks' life would be in
danger if he returned to South Dakota.

represented South Dakota at the hearing, said the
court yesterday ordered Brown to issue a gover
nor's warrant "to have Banks arrested and have
him delivered up to South Dakota."
Banks' location was not immediately known.
Battles added that Banks could also fight the
extradition v/arrant once he was arrested. Kline
said the court also noted that its order did not
"end the matter" because Banks could fight it.
School finance bill clears assembly
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown. Jr.'s
five-year, $3-billion school finance bill, which
would narrow the gap between rich and poor
school districts, narrowly cleared the state as
sembly yesterday.
It was the first time either house of the legisla
ture had approved a revamping of California's
school finance system since the state supreme
court ruled this year that the system discrimi
nated against districts with little taxable wealth.
The 55-2 1 vote, one more than the needed
two-thirds majority, masked considerable oppos
ition to the measure, particularly its effect on
districts with high property wealth and many
poor people,, like San Francisco.
The threi; San Francisco assemblymen, and

several others from the outlying areas, voted for
the bill reluctantly in hopes that the author, As
semblyman Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento), can
persuade Brown to increase the funding.
Assembly Speaker l.eo McCarthy (D-San Fran
cisco), said he voted for it because of a "general
faith" that Greene "is going to find a way to
recognize the problems ot urban districts with a
high concentration of foreign-language students
and kids with special educational problems."

Hussein visits Carter for talks
Washington — king Hussein of Jordan, who
has been cautious in discussing prospects for a
Middle East peace, told President Jimmy Carter
last night he feels "more encouraged and more
hopeful than 1 have for a long time" as a result of
talks at the White House.
During their first meeting earlier yesterday.
Carter and Hussein discussed possible ways of
admitting the Palestinians to Arab-Israeli negoti
ations.
There was no public mention of the Palestinian
issue, which in some ways is as troubling to I lus
sein as it is to the Israelis.
He fought a bloody war with Palestinian com
mandos in 1970 and 1971. Palestinian demands
for statehood might be fulfilled, with U.S. sup
port, on former Jordanian territory occupied by
Israel.
At a summit meeting of all Arab states in 1974,
representation rights over the Palestinians was
taken from Hussein and given solely to the Pales
tine Liberation Organization.
But since Israel, with the backing of the United
States, refused to deal with Yasir Arafat's group,
the administration and the Arabs have been
scrambling for a way to have the Palestinian view
point expressed at the Ceneva peace confer
ence they hope to reconvene before the end ot the
year.
Israel prefers to deal directly with Hussein,
considering the king to be the most conciliatory
of all Arab leaders.
UC research expenditures audited
Berkeley — University of California faculty
members are being warned to keep close tabs on
how federal research money is spent as a result of
government audits challenging up to $5 million
of university expenditures.
In a report to be presented to the UC-Berkeley
Academic Senate today, UC Business and Fi
nance Vice President John Perkins says there is a
federal auditing crackdown because of a "sig
nificant change in the federal-university rela
tionship."
The nine-campus UC system gets about $250
million for some 8000 federal projects, said uni
versity spokeswoman Sarah Molla.
Earlier this year, the Department of Health,

Education and Weliare, which oversees federal
research, asked UC to return from $4 to $5 million
that HEW said had been improperly accounted
for.
The university is challenging the govern
ment's figures and has been negotiating to re
solve accounting discrepancies.
The final settlement will probably take several
more months, Gross said, adding two areas ot
contention have been resolved.
The government initially found 100 cases
where consultants had been improperly ac
counted for. The final settlement found two cases
of error, with $810 to be returned, Gross said.
The government had said $57,000 was miss
pent for general purpose equipment. The settle
ment called for a return ot $4500, he said.
Gross said the government audited a sample ot
the university's projects and then extrapolated to
get the total figure.
"They can use a sample to determine there's a
problem," Gross said, but not to "establish the
amount we have to repay. This is hard money and
we want hard evidence."
Firefighters battle to control blaze
Yreka — Rain and hail aided weary firefighters
yesterday as they battled to control California's
worst forest fire of the drought-parched year.
The stubborn blaze, which blackened more
than two million board feet of timber on 2200
dust-dry acres about 25 miles northwest ot here,
was expected to be controlled by tonight, a Na
tional Forest Service spokesman said.
Ernie Weinberg said the fire had caused an
estimated $1 million damage to the watershed.
The blaze swept across HHO acres of Klamath
National Forest land and about 1320 acres of pri
vate property, mostly owned by International
Paper Co., he said
The fire started Saturday afternoon on private
land within a half-mile of a road. The specific
cause was still undetermined, but officials said it
appeared to have been man-caused.
The blaze was contained Sunday evening after
crews struggled to dig fire lines around the
perimeter in intense heat spurred by the unsea
sonably dry tinder.
Weinberg said some of the crews had minor
burns, but no serious injuries were reported.
