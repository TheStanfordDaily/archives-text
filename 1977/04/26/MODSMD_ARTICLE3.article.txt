# Carter seeks ceiling on hospital expenses

Washington (AF) — Fresident
Jimmy Carter asked Congress yester
day to impose a government ceiling on
rapidly rising hospital costs. He said
his plan could save consumers, the
government and health insurance
companies $2 billion the first year and
$5.5 billion in 1980.
The legislation sent to Capitol Hill
by C'aiter would limit the overall in
crease in hospital bills at most
facilities to nine per cent in the fiscal
vear beginning Oct. 1.
However. Health, Education and
Welfare Secretary Joseph Califano ad
mitted that loopholes and exceptions
for some hospitals could mean cost in
creases nationally will run as high as
10 per cent but "certainly not more
than that."
Health care costs have been rising 15

per cent a year, twice the national in
flation rate. At that rate, hospital costs,
which currently total $55 billion a
year, would double in five years. Hos
pital costs represent 40 per cent of an
nual health care costs, which are ex
pected to total $160 billion this year.
The administration has termed the
hospital cost containment plan "the
first step in making national health in
surance financially feasible."
Few consumers would feel the im
pact of the proposed ceiling im
mediately because the government,
Blue Cross and commercial insurance
carriers pay about 90 per cent of the
nation's hospital bills.
But the program eventually would
benefit more people by slowing the
rate of tax increases and health insur
ance premiums.

number of cars remains at seven, this car replacing the
oldest one on the force. Patrol cars generally last about
two years.
