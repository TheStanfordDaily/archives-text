# Zaire claims recapturing of major Shaba rail town
## 
### 
Kinshasa. Zaire (AP) — The Zaire
government claimed yesterday that it
has recaptured a key rail town from
katangan invaders in Shaba province
and that the rebels were retreating
back, toward Angola.
Diplomatic sources could not con
firm that Mutshatsha had been reta
ken, When reporters visiteii Shaba on
Sunday the government's front lines
were along the Lubudi River, 20 miles
east of the town and 50 miles west of
the copper-mining center of kolwe. i.
The reporters were told by army < -
ficers that it would take several days i ■
retake Mutshatsha because retreating
rebels had planted mines along the dirt
road parallel to the Benguela railroad
that runs through Mutshatsha and on
to the Angolan coast. Some officers
said the town of 20,000 had been de
serted and abandoned hy the rebels.
President Mobubu Sese Seko, who
flew to Shaba with the reporters,
stayed behind saying he wanted to

personally set foot into Mutshatsha.
There was no immediate word on
whether he had.
End of invasion?
Some observers here said the fall of
the town, a month after it was captured
by the rebels, could spell the end of the
seven-week-old invasion of the
copper-rich Shaba province, formerly
called Katanga.
But although the government re
ported that the rebels were retreating
back to Dilolo on the Angolan border,
some diplomats said they may be dis
persing into the sparsely populated
countryside in preparation for a prot
racted guerrilla war.
About 2000 Katangan exiles, led by
gendarmes who mounted an unsuc
cessful fight for the independence of
the southeastern province in the
19H0s, invaded from Angola on March
8 and occupied a third of their home
land.
After a two-week lull in the fighting,
the government launched ;i counterof
fensive last week, backed up by 1500
Moroccan troops loaned by King Has
san 11.
New help for Mobutu was reported
from South Korea, where a pro
government newspaper said the coun
try had decided to send Zaire $100,000
worth of military uniforms and medi
cal supplies.
No pygmies
Mobutu's government had previ
ously reported that pygmy warriors
armed with poisoned arrows had sur
rounded Mutshatsha. But one general
in Shaba told newsmen he hadn't seen
any pygmies, and other officers said
the 150 to 300 warriors had been pul
led out because their training "didn't
fit in" with the situation or terrain.
The war-zone, a 3000-foot-high

plateau, is covered with six-foot-high
elephant grass, and the pygmies stand
about four feet tall.
Reporters who visited Shaba on
Sunday said that for the most part the
war has been a quiet one. Only two
clashes with the rebels were reported
as of Sunday, a four-hour firefight on
April Ii and another small engage
ment a few days later.
