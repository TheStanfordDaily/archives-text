# Experiments may allay DNA fears

### Kim Hatamiya 
Scientists here have devised exper
iments with recombinant DNA which
mav prove that many of the feared
hazards of the controversial gene
s[ it ing technique do not exist. The
researchers also believe ways can be
found to avoid potential risks.
Ronald Davis, assistant professor of
biochemistry at the School of
Medicine, said experiments done
under controlled conditions should
negate the fear that an organism would
be created in the laboratory that "could
take over the world."
DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, carries
genetic traits in all living organisms.
Recombinant DNA involves recombin
ing DNA components.
Davis and his colleague, John Came
ron, combined genes from a simple or
ganism, baker's yeast, with lambda
bacteriophage, a virus that can growin
bacteria.
Davis and Cameron recombined the
yeast and virus genes to see if any one
gene or group of genes would make the
bacteriophage grow better than ,K "
original organism. They insert"'! vir
tually every gene from the y<
common organism km wn to h,-
less to humans, into tin
chromosome.
Davis and Cameron then (
resulting organisms con'aii
combinant DNA for many gen
until the strongest one emerg lis
one gene, from perhaps 10.000 les
in yeast, allowed the bacteriophage to
grow best.
However, when the original or
ganism was also added to those con
taining recombinant DNA, it always
emerged as the strongest organism.
From these results. Davis and Came
ron concluded that no recombinant
DNA can be made from the original
yeast genes which would result in a
superior growth rate for the recombin
ant organism.
Davis said he suspected the effects of
DNA recombination on the growth of
organisms range from having no effect
at all to having a detrimental one. The
researchers said they believe their
work demonstrates this absolutely for
at least one organism, yeast.
But Davis said that preliminary ex
periments with higher recombinant
DNA organisms reveal that they too
make bacteria grow worse, not better.
The advantage of this technique is
that scientists will now be able to find
the gene sequence they are looking for
quickly, without a random search.
