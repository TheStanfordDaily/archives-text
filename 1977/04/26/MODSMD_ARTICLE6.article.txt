## Socialized medicine plan 
### 
Robert J. Segal

As though David Sartoris' fantasy on socialized
medicine were not annoying enough for publica
tiononce, the Daily had t he gal 1 to publish it twice!
Perhaps the puerile diatribe was printed twice in
hopes of getting a response from the (conservative)
medical community. This response will certainly
Hot be worth printing twice, but perhaps worth
reading en passant.
The advantages of socialized medicine which
are mentioned would result in more doctors, more
compassionate doctors, better educated in less
time, treating patients successfully in godforsaken
places, having been chosen by laymen, for pre
ordained specialization.
One need only look at certain pre-paid health
care plans (or aspects of the Veterans Administra
tion system) to see how salaried physicians can
have less incentive for compassion than private
practioners.
'Socialization'
In fact, physicians may gravitate towards situa
tions of "socialization" to avoid emotional in
volvement with patients. Furthermore, with the
expected increase in utilization of health-care
facilities that would accompany socialization,
waiting time would be increased, and rushed doc
tors would be more rushed.
There is ever reason to expect the system to be
swamped with minor complaints of healthy pa
tients. who would not otherwise have sought med
ical care.
Shortening the curriculum of a future der
matologist by excluding cardiovascular physiol
ogy, as Sartoris suggests, might be a fatal error.
True, one doesn't need to know the details of
myocardial excitation-contraction coupling to
tieat a case of warts. But not all skin diseases are
limited to the skin. Patients have had cardiac ar-

rusts from local anesthesia (as an allergic reaction)
and resuscitation requires knowledge of cardiac
physiology.
As an example, some ot the early cardiac
pacemakers can be inhibited by the el ectr ic current
used to control bleeding in some dermatologic
procedures.
If future dermatologists are to be denied know
ledge of cardiac physiology in Sartoris' hypotheti
cal medical school, what else will they be pre
vented from learning? And who will benefit?
1 take strong issue with the statement, "Indeed,
the patient is in a better position to know what
constitutes a good doctor than another physician."
Could the same be said for veterinarians?
Don't get me wrong — doctors are patients
themselves from time to time, and it is easy totell if
the physician acts compassionately, and if the
treatment works, but medicine is a science as well
as an art, and one must be judged by his peers.
Noble sentiments
The sentiments expressed by Sartoris are noble,
and I, too, would like to see improvements in the
areas he singles out. However, these are complex
problems, and even if medicine were socialized by
fiat, it would create more problems than it would
solve.
Of course, we are moving slowly towards in
creasing socialization of medicine and federal
regulations, hut this is being done deliberately,
with some intelligence.
I was going to respond to Sartoris'article the first
time it was published, but it took the second publi
cation to overcome my considerable inertia.
Perhaps you should publish everything controver
sial twice.

hopes of getting a response from the (conservative)
medical community. This response will certainly
Hot be worth printing twice, but perhaps worth
reading en passant.
The advantages of socialized medicine which
are mentioned would result in more doctors, more
compassionate doctors, better educated in less
time, treating patients successfully in godforsaken
places, having been chosen by laymen, for pre
ordained specialization.
One need only look at certain pre-paid health
care plans (or aspects of the Veterans Administra
tion system) to see how salaried physicians can
have less incentive for compassion than private
practioners.
'Socialization'
In fact, physicians may gravitate towards situa
tions of "socialization" to avoid emotional in
volvement with patients. Furthermore, with the
expected increase in utilization of health-care
facilities that would accompany socialization,
waiting time would be increased, and rushed doc
tors would be more rushed.
There is ever reason to expect the system to be
swamped with minor complaints of healthy pa
tients. who would not otherwise have sought med
ical care.
Shortening the curriculum of a future der
matologist by excluding cardiovascular physiol
ogy, as Sartoris suggests, might be a fatal error.
True, one doesn't need to know the details of
myocardial excitation-contraction coupling to
tieat a case of warts. But not all skin diseases are
limited to the skin. Patients have had cardiac ar-

rusts from local anesthesia (as an allergic reaction)
and resuscitation requires knowledge of cardiac
physiology.
As an example, some ot the early cardiac
pacemakers can be inhibited by the el ectr ic current
used to control bleeding in some dermatologic
procedures.
If future dermatologists are to be denied know
ledge of cardiac physiology in Sartoris' hypotheti
cal medical school, what else will they be pre
vented from learning? And who will benefit?
1 take strong issue with the statement, "Indeed,
the patient is in a better position to know what
constitutes a good doctor than another physician."
Could the same be said for veterinarians?
Don't get me wrong — doctors are patients
themselves from time to time, and it is easy totell if
the physician acts compassionately, and if the
treatment works, but medicine is a science as well
as an art, and one must be judged by his peers.
Noble sentiments
The sentiments expressed by Sartoris are noble,
and I, too, would like to see improvements in the
areas he singles out. However, these are complex
problems, and even if medicine were socialized by
fiat, it would create more problems than it would
solve.
Of course, we are moving slowly towards in
creasing socialization of medicine and federal
regulations, hut this is being done deliberately,
with some intelligence.
I was going to respond to Sartoris'article the first
time it was published, but it took the second publi
cation to overcome my considerable inertia.
Perhaps you should publish everything controver
sial twice.
