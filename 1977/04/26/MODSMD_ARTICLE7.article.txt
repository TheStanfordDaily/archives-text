# Cultural identity important

As the recent television
blockbuster Roots proved, one's
family origins should not be for
gotten. Through a basic know
ledge of our past, claim some
psychologists, we can come to a
better understanding of our
selves.
Not that we should all go out
and hire a genealogist to tell us
that our great-great uncle wore
an iron bra and sang barber shop
harmony. Rather, suffice it to say
that it's good for your psyche to
know from whence you came.
Some people have no desire to
vault way back in time in search
of their family trees. Personally,
I'm scared to death of finding out
that I am a direct descendant of
Catherine the Creat's horse. 1,
like many others, am totally
satisfied with maintaining a
strong cultural identity with my
home state.
Of course, such a cultural
identity is superficial. One
might create deeper personal
sentiments by tracing one's fam
ily back to Africa, Mesopotamia
or the La√ürea tar pits.
However, the home state of a
student who is a thousand miles
away from his or her family can
also come to have a special
meaning.
Individuality
By identifying with his/her
home state, a student can main
tain a sense of individuality.
And here, where the student
body often seems homogeneous,
individuality is important.
In fact, some find the home
state identification so strong that
they would rather refer to them
selves as Hoosiers, Badgers or
Buckeyes, than Irish-Catholics,
Slavs or Ashkenazies. Neverthe

less, I maintain that a geographic
identity is just as legitimate as a
cultural identity.
Judging from what I've re
cently seen on campus, spring
time here is dangerous to out
of-staters. In this picture-perfect
weather situation, everyone
seems to make wild attempts to
California-ize themselves.
When people from the north,
east, south or midwest attempt to
abandon their roots and blend
into the West Coast environ
ment. the outcome is just plain
weird.
For example, a freshman from
Texas exposed himself much too
suddenly to the Bay Area's heat
without humidity. Being from
the South, he was not used to
such a climate. As a result of the
injuries he sustained, he must
now get a daily fix of humidity
by spending 10 minutes in a
phone booth that has been con
verted into a sauna.
Sprained ankle
Then there's the sophomore
from Bleetly, N.D., who awk-

wardly tried to blend in with the
skateboard crowd. He sprained
his ankle when he attempted a
running startonan upside-down
skateboard.
I really feel sorry for the girl
from Bix, Maine. She broke eight
teeth because she thought that
puka shell necklaces were
strung with candy. This is prob
ably also psychological, but I
break out in hives whenever 1 at
tempt to wear those shirts with
the two little bare feet embroi
dered on the front.
So, a word of caution to those
out-of-staters who try to aban
don their roots. Keep tab on the
state of your health. Yes, I realize
that "when in Rome, do as the
Romans do;" however, the
California lifestyle must be ap
proached gradually and with all
due respect to your geographic
origin. It is certainly no fun to be
on a first-name basis with every
nurse at Cowell.
