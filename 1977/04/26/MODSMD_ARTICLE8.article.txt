# Letter: Wall location controversial

Albers' Wall

I don't think that Lorenz Eitner under
stands why people are opposed to Al
bers Wall.Heseems tothink (Daily, April 13)
that Stanford students are a bunch of unap
preciative "Philistines," blindly opposed to
all that is art. There may be some truth to
that, but for me and the people I've talked to.
the main objection to Stanford's latest piece
of "art" is the proposed location.
There are few open grassy areas near the
center of campus. The plot in front of the
Physics Tank is one of them, and on any

sunny day, you can see lots of people out
sunning themselves or playing frisbee.
At night there is a beautiful view of the
Tank through the arches of the Quad. 1
would object to anything obstructing that
space (even the Mona Lisa!), and I particu
larly object to a 54 feet long, nine feet tall
"plain white brick wall" going there.
Eitner and Albert Elsen must have a very
strange set of priorities to want to substitute
a dubious work of technology for an irrep
laceable and enjoyable piece of nature.
Perhaps all is not lost. Protests to the ap

propriate authorities (President Richard
Lyman, Director of Facilities and Properties
Oscar Nelson, Vice President and Provost
William Miller, Vice President of Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig, etc.) might relocate
the wall before it goes up this summer.
If not, I suppose both our primitive tastes
and Eitner's apparent need for artistic out
rage will be partly satisfied by those who
will redecorate the wall to reflect their own
artistic sensibilities â€”at least an attempt at
art for the people.
