# Researchers here may have discovered subatomic quark
## 
### Mark Schleiss 
Evidence pointing toward the exis
tence of the quark — a subatomic par
ticle with a fractional charge less than
that of the electron — was reported
yesterday by Physics Prof. William
Fairbank and graduate student George
Laßue at the annual meeting of the
American Physical Society in
Washington, D.C.
"These findings are quite revolutio
nary," said Physics Department
Chairman Walter Meyerhof, "and that
makes them difficult to accept unless
they are confirmed by researchers here
and elsewhere. If the findings are con
firmed, they will have a major impact
on the future of physics."
Until now the quark has existed only
in theory as a basic building block of
matter to explain some anomalies
turned up in particle research.
The smallest known electric charges
in nature are those of the electron and
proton with a single negative and posi
tive charge respectively. According to
the quark theory, one quark would
have either one-third or two-thirds of
an electron charge. Scientists had pre
viously been unable, however, to iso
late evidence of the quark charge.
'Cannot explain'
In Washington yesterday, Fairbank
announced "evidence for fractional
charges on matter close to one-third of
an electron charge . . . which we can
not explain by magnetic or electric
multiple forces.
"This discovery is tentative, 1
think," said Fairbank. "We have two
cases where we have been unable to
account for the third of a charge by any
spurious forces, and we are unable to
explain it by any other means but say
ing it really is a fractional charge."
Scientists have attempted to sepa
rate protons into quark pairs (one-third
plus two-thirds equals one proton) by
bombarding them with particles from
high-energy accelerators and cosmic
rays, but to no avail. Actual separation
into quarks is generally considered
impossible.
Fairbank and Laßue, along with

former graduate student Arthur
Hebard of Bell Laboratories, centered
their research around free quarks exist
ing in nature. Unable to find other
quarks with which to mate, these
"free" quarks can attach themselves to
other matter.
Free quarks
The Stanford investigators tried to
find free quarks using tiny niobium
metal balls for matter. The procedure
they used involved measuring charge
in eight of the spheres, each about
one-quarter the size of the ball on a
ball-point pen.
Out of eight balls, the scientists were
able to make the net force on six of
them equal. On two they could not.
The charge that was left over, accord
ing to Laßue, was "on one of the balls
very close to minus one-third of a
charge, and on the other very close to
plus one-third of a charge."
After careful examination, the scien
tists were satisfied that other forces
such as magnetism did not cause the
ball to "mimic" the effect of a frac
tional charge.
A possible hint of the real source of
the fractional charges came from prep
aration of the balls for the experiment
by heating them. Three balls were
heated on a tungsten surface, five on a
niobium surface.

Two of those first three were those
carrying the fractional charges. The
rest were all neutnj. Fairbank specu
lated that the tungsten may have been
the original source of both fractional
charges.
"So this seems to be evidence that
fractional charge exists on matter,"
Fairbank said. "In order to be sure that
this is really so, we will examine many
more balls. If this is really the answer,
we can tell what material they are on
and how abundant they are."
Fairbank emphasized that the
charges were not actual evidence that
the quark had been separated.
"The next step would be to try to
separate them out by their electrical
properties from other matter and ob
serve exactly what they (quarks) are. It
is an inference to think that this is the
same as finding the quark, although
that's what some people will con
clude."
Accompanying Faribank's group to
Washington is Physics Prof. Burton
Richter, 1976 Nobel Laureate in
Physics. Richter will speak to the
Washington conference today on the
psi particle research that won the
Nobel prize for him.
Richter said the research he is doing
is related to Fairbank's and Laßue's
but has no direct connections.

quark theory. Fairbank announced yesterday he had
made the "tentative" discovery of a fractional charge of
an electron.
Evidence pointing toward the exis
tence of the quark — a subatomic par
ticle with a fractional charge less than
that of the electron — was reported
yesterday by Physics Prof. William
Fairbank and graduate student George
Laßue at the annual meeting of the
American Physical Society in
Washington, D.C.
"These findings are quite revolutio
nary," said Physics Department
Chairman Walter Meyerhof, "and that
makes them difficult to accept unless
they are confirmed by researchers here
and elsewhere. If the findings are con
firmed, they will have a major impact
on the future of physics."
Until now the quark has existed only
in theory as a basic building block of
matter to explain some anomalies
turned up in particle research.
The smallest known electric charges
in nature are those of the electron and
proton with a single negative and posi
tive charge respectively. According to
the quark theory, one quark would
have either one-third or two-thirds of
an electron charge. Scientists had pre
viously been unable, however, to iso
late evidence of the quark charge.
'Cannot explain'
In Washington yesterday, Fairbank
announced "evidence for fractional
charges on matter close to one-third of
an electron charge . . . which we can
not explain by magnetic or electric
multiple forces.
"This discovery is tentative, 1
think," said Fairbank. "We have two
cases where we have been unable to
account for the third of a charge by any
spurious forces, and we are unable to
explain it by any other means but say
ing it really is a fractional charge."
Scientists have attempted to sepa
rate protons into quark pairs (one-third
plus two-thirds equals one proton) by
bombarding them with particles from
high-energy accelerators and cosmic
rays, but to no avail. Actual separation
into quarks is generally considered
impossible.
Fairbank and Laßue, along with

former graduate student Arthur
Hebard of Bell Laboratories, centered
their research around free quarks exist
ing in nature. Unable to find other
quarks with which to mate, these
"free" quarks can attach themselves to
other matter.
Free quarks
The Stanford investigators tried to
find free quarks using tiny niobium
metal balls for matter. The procedure
they used involved measuring charge
in eight of the spheres, each about
one-quarter the size of the ball on a
ball-point pen.
Out of eight balls, the scientists were
able to make the net force on six of
them equal. On two they could not.
The charge that was left over, accord
ing to Laßue, was "on one of the balls
very close to minus one-third of a
charge, and on the other very close to
plus one-third of a charge."
After careful examination, the scien
tists were satisfied that other forces
such as magnetism did not cause the
ball to "mimic" the effect of a frac
tional charge.
A possible hint of the real source of
the fractional charges came from prep
aration of the balls for the experiment
by heating them. Three balls were
heated on a tungsten surface, five on a
niobium surface.

Two of those first three were those
carrying the fractional charges. The
rest were all neutnj. Fairbank specu
lated that the tungsten may have been
the original source of both fractional
charges.
"So this seems to be evidence that
fractional charge exists on matter,"
Fairbank said. "In order to be sure that
this is really so, we will examine many
more balls. If this is really the answer,
we can tell what material they are on
and how abundant they are."
Fairbank emphasized that the
charges were not actual evidence that
the quark had been separated.
"The next step would be to try to
separate them out by their electrical
properties from other matter and ob
serve exactly what they (quarks) are. It
is an inference to think that this is the
same as finding the quark, although
that's what some people will con
clude."

Washington is Physics Prof. Burton
Richter, 1976 Nobel Laureate in
Physics. Richter will speak to the
Washington conference today on the
