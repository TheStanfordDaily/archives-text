Did Roger Hardy, former pres
ident of United Stanford
Employees (USE), sell the work
ers out when the union contract
with the University was
negotiated? Of course not. Did
he secretly meet alone with
management and consciously
make agreements detrimental to
the interest of workers? Of
course not. Certainly no such
evidence has been produced.
Nor can anyone deny that it
was at the insistence of the
negotiating team that Hardy met
alone with Douglas Barton, head
of employe relations. Should the
negotiating team have given this
authorization to Hardy? Of
course not!
The character assassination of
Hardy made hy Jim Berk in a
headlined article in Employees
Organize, under the guise of a
letter to the editor, could be in
terpreted as an unprincipled,
last-minute attempt to influence
the election.
Were Hardy guilty of anti
union acts, this information
should have been made public
during negotiations and in the
weeks following the signing of
the contract long before the elec
tion.
Union leaders in the past have
made deals with employers for
their own personal benefit or in
the belief that they knew what
was best for Workers. No negotia
tions should be held in secret.
No labor leader should be en
trusted with the authority to
meet and negotiate alone with
management a contract affecting
hundreds of workers for several
years.
No member of the negotiating
team who passively or actively
acquiesced to Hardy's meeting
alone witli Barton can disclaim
responsibility for the results of
such meetings. Such power
given to an experienced labor
leader is inexcusable. Such
power given to an inexperienced
one is reprehensible.
Those of us who voted for
Hardy for president were well
aware of his shortcomings.

Those who refrained from or
voted against him were, by and
large, opposed to Berk's political
philosophy, his personality
and/or methods of work. They
were fearful that because of Har
dy's inexperience, he would be
dominated and manipulated by
Berk, becoming his stooge and
mouthpiece.
Before Hardy had the oppor
tunity to learn or be oriented on
the job, he was thrust into
negotiating a contract under the
nost adverse conditions. It was
an overwhelmingly difficult task
that would have taxed the
abilities of an experienced labor
leader.
In my opinion, no one indi
vidual or group in USE at pre
sent has the capability, experi
ence or personality to negotiate a
long-term contract with an
employer of theUniversity's size
and strength.
Justified criticism can be
leveled against Hardy and the
negotiating team as well as the
contract representatives for re
fusing to take advantage of the
expert help available from our
parent organization, the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) and from the Santa Clara
LaborCouncil. It was, after all, at
their initiative that a break
through in negotiations was
made and the 1973 strike settled
with a satisfactory first contract.
Did we not join and become
part of the national labor move
ment because of the support and
strength such affiliation with the
AFL-CIO could give us? Had we
secured the backing of our inter
national SEIU, not only would
we have gained an experienced
organizer and negotiator, but our
leadership would also have
gained the confidence of our
membership necessary to secure
our justified needs and rights.
We can learn from our inex
perience and mistakes and pro
ceed to build a stronger United
Stanford Employees union.
