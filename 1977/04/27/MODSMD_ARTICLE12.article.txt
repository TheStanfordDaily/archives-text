# Interview: Randy Stone hill
## A 						new kind of rock musician 
### Karen Caesar 
Maybe you've seen those blue
posters around campus, adver
tising Randy Stonehill. Maybe
you haven't. Or maybe you've
heard someone in your house or
dorm say he is a "Christian rock
singer," and maybe you were in
trigued.
Or maybe you were turned off.
But should you have precon
ceived notions of what a Christ
ian rock singer should look like,
sound like, and act like, prepare
to heave them overboard. Randy
Stonehill will destroy them all.
In a phone interview last
week, Stonehill discussed his
music, his life and his Christian
ity, which is what he will do this
Friday night at 8 in Kresge Au
ditorium. Don't expect hard
core, preachy evangelism; ex
pect a funny, personable, homey
kind of guy who plays good
guitar and looks a little like Rod
Stewart.
He's had an interesting life,

this 25 year old rock singer from
San Jose. He began taking drugs
when he was 14, formed his own
rock band at 15, and from there
his life took a nosedive.
But the man's a. survivor. He
became a Christian and took
time to develop his musical ta
lent; he has two albums bellind
him, and is currently cutting a
third. Seven years in the busi
ness have taught him a lot.
Stereotype
Stonehill spoke frankly of the
difficulties in being accepted as
a Christian musician. "The main
problem I have faced is the
stereotype that comes with being
a Christian," he said. "People
expect to get this 'message'
rammed down their throats, and
they expect to get propagan
dized and I don't do that."
What does he do, then? Does
he tell his audiences how he be
came a Christian? "I don't do any
of that kind of 'pat' stuff," he
said. "I just kind of 'share from

the hip' what God has done with
me. Maybe it's more sharing my
viewpoints of things, sharing
about important issues from the
new perspective I have."
He's quick to emphasize the
informality of the evening. "It's
not speechmaking and it's not
giving little pat answers to
things. It's just sharing a little
love and speaking about my vis
ion of things from the new
perspective that I have in the
Lord."
But while he does have a mes
sage for his audiences, he works
hard to avoid alienating them.
"It's a matter of communicat
ing that message tastefully and
artistically and in love," he said,
"and I think that's starting to
happen now."
Humor
Humor plays an integral role
in a Randy Stonehill concert.
"People tend to remember the
things they laugh at," he said. "1

think it's important for us to be
able to laugh at ourselves. When
we look at ourselves and at all
the contradictions in our lives
and all our funny little habits,
there is a lot to laugh at, so I
guess 1 approach a lot of things at
a humorous level."
Yet S tone lull is sensitive to his
audience. His timing em
phasizes this; he realizes that
people have come to be enter
tained, and he is careful to give
them what they have come for.
"There are times to be heavy and
times to be light," he said. "I try
to discern which is which."
Insights
When he talks about the evolu
tion of Christian rock, his in
sights are immediately apparent.
He has been with it almost since
its genesis and even though it is
his livelihood, does not hesitate
to note its weaknesses.
"Quality has been sacrificed
for Christian cliches, and cliches
don't really speak," he said.

"That's been the problem, along
with a kind of false view of
spirituality." He said that Christ
ians frequently lose touch with
reality for a while, much to the
detriment of the music.
Yet there are Christian musi
cians who have been very suc
cessful. Paul Stookey (of Peter,
Paul and Mary), Barry McCuire
(remember "On the Eve of De
struction?"), Larry Norman, and
now Randy Stonehill. Stonehill
described these musicians as
. a handful of artists who are
specifically called to write
music that's going to really bring
Christ down to kind of a 'street
level'. . . where people can un
derstand how personal God is,
and where God can really be ac
cessible instead of some uptight
cosmic being in an ivory tower."
Is there anything Stonehill
wants his audience to know be
fore he comes here? "I would
want them to know that I'm just a
person like anybody else, and I
believe the only difference bet
ween a Christian and anybody
else is not that we're 'spiritual
giants' or that we're better than
anybody else, but simply that we
know in Whom we believe, and
we know where hope is."
