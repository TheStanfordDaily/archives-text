What is the statue out in front of the San Francisco
Airport?
-D.C.
It is called "Statue of Peace" and was done by
Benny Buffano. The statue has been at the airport
since around the late '50s, at which time it was
located in Lot 1. It has since been relocated and
now occupies a position near the main thorough
ways.

Why do all library books have two little penciled
in marks on the title page? This bugs me.
-C.W.R. 11l
"They're 'tick marks' " said Asst. Chief Libra
rian Richard Pollard. These little marks are used to
indicate what categories the book is entered under
in the University main catalogs.
Usually librarians underline the first initial of

the author's last name. But if the author used a
pseudonym, like Mark Twain, then the real name,
Samuel Clemens, would be written in, and the "C"
underlined. If there are more than three authors,
Pollard said that the book would be catalogued by
its title.
Tick marks also indicate whether a book has
been catalogued, so if someone in the catalog de
partment opens the book, it is immediately evident
that the book has been done.
Personally, 1 don't find them too annoying. They
seem to be simple and efficient. So just don't let
them "tick you off" too much!
