### Cathy Dickerson 
Stanford's baseball squad lost
a seesaw contest, 12-9, to the
Galluping Gaels of St. Mary's
College yesterday at Sunken
Diamond.
St. Mary's jumped out to a
four-run lead in the first two
frames, ripping Stanford starter
Bruce Fiala for four hits, with the
damage coming on centerfielder
Tim O'Hara's three-run home
run. Freshman Larry kuhn came
on in relief of Fiala in the top of
the third.
Stanford goes ahead
With one down in the third,
second baseman Todd Ervin
singled and Larry Reynolds and
Gary Scott walked to load the
bases. After Mike Codiroli fan
ned, Tom Guardino laced a line
drive back through the box off
the St. Mary's pitcher's leg to score
Ervin and Reynolds. An infield
error brought Scott home to give
the Cards the lead.
St. Mary's answered with one
run in the fourth to tie the con
test, then went ahead in the fifth
frame when a hit-by-a-pitch bat
ter, two doubles, a sacrifice fly
and a home run were good for
four runs.

Stanford drew within one run
of the Gaels in the bottom of the
fifth when shortstop Dave Perez
walloped a three-run homer over
the fence in left-center.
Contest sealed
St. Mary's iced the contest in
the eighth when it scored three
runs off southpaw John Yandle.
Yandle, who relieved kuhn in
the sixth, walked Gael second
baseman Reid Gotthardt, yielded
a single to designated hitter
Terry Van Hook, then was tug
ged by Curt Cannedy for a three
run home run.
A two-out rally by the Cardi
nals in the ninth fell short.
Last chance
Trailing by three after picking
up one run in the eighth, Perez
touched reliever Devallon
Harper for a single. Pepe
Hinojosa walked so that Ervin
became the potential tying run
as he stepped to the plate. Alter
battling to a full count, Harper
caught Ervi n looking to retire t he
side and end the contest.
The Cardinals travel to Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo this
weekend for a three-game non
conference series.
Stanford's next Pacific-8 con

tests will be here against the
