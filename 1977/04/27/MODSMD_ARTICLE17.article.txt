# Dettamanti named water polo coach
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Dante Dettamanti, coach of
UC-Santa Barbara's successful
water polo team, has been hired
to replace Art Lambert as the
Stanford water polo coach, the
Athletic Department announced
Monday. Lambert, who led the
Cardinals to the NCAA crown
last fall, resigned last month to
devote his energies to Stanford's
volleyball teams.
Dettamanti led UCSB to a
fourth-place finish in the 1976
NCAA Championships. His
overall record at Santa Barbara
was 42-29, including the 1976
I'CAA championship.
Sitting in Lambert's office
next to the Cards' NCAA team
trophy on Monday, Dettamanti
said, "I'm excited to have a
chance to work with athletes of
this caliber. Being the champs
puts pressure on me individu
ally.
Damned either way
"Following Coach Lambert,
you're in a position as a coach
where you're damned if you do
and you're damned if you don't.
If you don't win, people ask
what's wrong, and if you do win,
people say well look at all the
talent he inherited."
Dettamanti's Santa Barbara
squad met Stanford several
times last season, including a 7-6
defeat by the Cards in the NCAA
semifinals, so the new coach is
familiar with Stanford's prog
ram.
"I will continue to take advan
tage of the team's weapons —
speed, quickness and fine out
standing shooting — with an of
fense emphasizing the fast break
with what we call the counter
attack.
"There will be no radical

changes," Dettamanti said about
next year's team. "My offense
will be slightly different with
more picks and screens.
Adjustment
"The major difference will be
that the team has to adjust to a
new coach and 1 have to adjust to
new players."
Dettamanti will familiarize
himself with the Cardinals this
summer when he coaches the
Stanford AAU team. He will also
be the assistant coach of the U.S.
water polo team which will
compete in the World University
Student Cames in Bulgaria later
this year.
A 1965 graduate of UC-Davis,
Dettamanti coached at Davis,
UCLA and Occidental before
taking the helm for three years at
Santa Barbara.
The 34-year-old Dettamanti
will also join Debbie Meyer as an
assistant to Cardinal swimming
coach Jim Gaughran. While at
Oxy, Dettamanti led theTigers to
four winning seasons, including
a conference title and a second
place finish in the NAIA Champ
ionships in 1974.

taking the helm for three years at
Santa Barbara.
The 34-year-old Dettamanti
will also join Debbie Meyer as an
assistant to Cardinal swimming
coach Jim Gaughran. While at
Oxy, Dettamanti led theTigers to
four winning seasons, including
a conference title and a second
place finish in the NAIA Champ
ionships in 1974.

Dante Dettamanti, coach of
UC-Santa Barbara's successful
water polo team, has been hired
to replace Art Lambert as the
Stanford water polo coach, the
Athletic Department announced
Monday. Lambert, who led the
Cardinals to the NCAA crown
last fall, resigned last month to
devote his energies to Stanford's
volleyball teams.
Dettamanti led UCSB to a
fourth-place finish in the 1976
NCAA Championships. His
overall record at Santa Barbara
was 42-29, including the 1976
I'CAA championship.
Sitting in Lambert's office
next to the Cards' NCAA team
trophy on Monday, Dettamanti
said, "I'm excited to have a
chance to work with athletes of
this caliber. Being the champs
puts pressure on me individu
ally.
Damned either way
"Following Coach Lambert,
you're in a position as a coach
where you're damned if you do
and you're damned if you don't.
If you don't win, people ask
what's wrong, and if you do win,
people say well look at all the
talent he inherited."
Dettamanti's Santa Barbara
squad met Stanford several
times last season, including a 7-6
defeat by the Cards in the NCAA
semifinals, so the new coach is
familiar with Stanford's prog
ram.
"I will continue to take advan
tage of the team's weapons —
speed, quickness and fine out
standing shooting — with an of
fense emphasizing the fast break
with what we call the counter
attack.
"There will be no radical

changes," Dettamanti said about
next year's team. "My offense
will be slightly different with
more picks and screens.
Adjustment
"The major difference will be
that the team has to adjust to a
new coach and 1 have to adjust to
new players."
Dettamanti will familiarize
himself with the Cardinals this
summer when he coaches the
Stanford AAU team. He will also
be the assistant coach of the U.S.
water polo team which will
compete in the World University
Student Cames in Bulgaria later
this year.
A 1965 graduate of UC-Davis,
Dettamanti coached at Davis,
UCLA and Occidental before
taking the helm for three years at
Santa Barbara.
The 34-year-old Dettamanti
will also join Debbie Meyer as an
assistant to Cardinal swimming
coach Jim Gaughran. While at
Oxy, Dettamanti led theTigers to
four winning seasons, including
a conference title and a second
place finish in the NAIA Champ
ionships in 1974.
