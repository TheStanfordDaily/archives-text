Frailty, thy name is woman.'
â€”William Shakespeare
Hamlet, Act I, Scene II
Ah. Bard, you are a master wordsmith; you write
with such style, such flair, but . . . but you really
don't know women all that well.
Take a look around. Those athletes you see lining
up for a scrum or handling lacrosse sticks with such
ease, they are hardly what you might call frail.
I mean, really Bill, would you want to mix it up
with them out there on the rugby field?
Hardly, I think. You might soil your ruffles.
Bard, these aren't your demure, stay-at-home
Elizabethian women. These are well-trained
athletes with the strength, stamina and finesse to
play high-caliber competition.
They compete in everything from crew to field
hockey to soccer. Football remains one of the few
sports women here have yet to tackle on an in
terscholastic level.
No, Stanford women do not shy away from con
tact sports.
On the contrary, women's soccer coach Phil
Wright told us he had so many players try out that
he had to draw up a JV schedule so everyone would
have a chance to play.
Bard, how can you say the female of the species
is frail?
Energetic, hard-working, agile, but never frail.
