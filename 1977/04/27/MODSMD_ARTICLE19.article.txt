# Men, women play today
## Netters host San Diego 
### 
There's no rest for a tennis
player.
After coming off last week's
four-day Ojai Intercollegiate
tournament, the Card men and
women netters return to dual
match action today. The men
take on No. H ranked Pepperdine
while the women go against San
Jose State. Both matches begin at
2:30 at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
Coach Dick Could was "not
overly pleased" about the Cards'
second place showing at Ojai.
"We were out of contention
early because we lost our first
three opening round matches,"
he said. No. 4 man John Rast lost
to Charles Strode of USC, 4-6,
4-6; frosh Jim Hodges lost toCary
Stansbury of Cal; and trosh
Lloyd Bourne was downed by
Cal's Chris Dunk, 4-6. 1-6.
The big news out of the Ojai
tourney however, was sopho
more Matt Mitchell's copping of
the first place honors. Mitchell
defeated UCLA's Ferdi Taygan
in straight sets in the semifinals
before knocking off Manson, 6-0,
6-3, in the title match.
Just two weeks before, Mitch
ell lost to Manson, 6-2, 6-0 in Los
Angeles and last weekend in
Maples Pavilion was defeated by

the Trojan junior, 7-6 (5-2), 6-4.
"Matt played both matches at
Ojai against Taygan and Manson
with more calmness and author
ity than he did up here indoors,"
Could said.
The Cards will have to get
back "in the groove" for dual
matches this afternoon against
Pepperdine as it has a win over
No. 2 ranked Trinity already this
season. Could is unsure of the
character of the team, however,
because it is made up of "a lot of
foreigners."
The Card women welcome
back top sophomore Barb Jordan

into the starting lineup. Jordan
has been sitting out almost two
months due to tendinitis in her
shoulder.
Coach Anne Hill said sopho
more Diane Morrison will not be
playing against the Spartans be
cause "she played a long hard
tournament last weekend." Mor
rison lost in the semis at Ojai to
eventual titlist Barb Hallquist of
USC, 6-2, 2-6, 2-6.
Susie Hagey, who defaulted
early at Ojai because of illness,
will not return to the lineup to
day.

6-3, in the title match.
Just two weeks before, Mitch
ell lost to Manson, 6-2, 6-0 in Los
Angeles and last weekend in
Maples Pavilion was defeated by

the Trojan junior, 7-6 (5-2), 6-4.
"Matt played both matches at
Ojai against Taygan and Manson
with more calmness and author
ity than he did up here indoors,"
Could said.
The Cards will have to get
back "in the groove" for dual
matches this afternoon against
Pepperdine as it has a win over
No. 2 ranked Trinity already this
season. Could is unsure of the
character of the team, however,
because it is made up of "a lot of
foreigners."
The Card women welcome
back top sophomore Barb Jordan

into the starting lineup. Jordan
has been sitting out almost two
months due to tendinitis in her
shoulder.
Coach Anne Hill said sopho
more Diane Morrison will not be
playing against the Spartans be
cause "she played a long hard
tournament last weekend." Mor
rison lost in the semis at Ojai to
eventual titlist Barb Hallquist of
USC, 6-2, 2-6, 2-6.
Susie Hagey, who defaulted
early at Ojai because of illness,

overly pleased" about the Cards'
second place showing at Ojai.
"We were out of contention
early because we lost our first
three opening round matches,"
he said. No. 4 man John Rast lost
to Charles Strode of USC, 4-6,
4-6; frosh Jim Hodges lost toCary
Stansbury of Cal; and trosh
Lloyd Bourne was downed by
Cal's Chris Dunk, 4-6. 1-6.

tourney however, was sopho
more Matt Mitchell's copping of
the first place honors. Mitchell

6-3, in the title match.
