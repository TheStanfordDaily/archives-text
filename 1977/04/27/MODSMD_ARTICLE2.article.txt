# Grads hope to recall senators

A petition to hold a recall election
for ASSU Graduate Senators Tom De
vine, Jim King and Jeff Stoler is cur
rently being circulated among
graduate students here.
Both the petition and a letter to
graduate students explaining its pur
pose were written and distributed by
former Council of Presidents (COP)
member Deric Jennings.
Jennings claimed he had "in hand
about 100 signatures" of the 800 vali
dated graduate signatures necessary to
hold the recall election.
"The recent episode with (ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Chris) Mathe is not
the only reason I'm doing this," stated
Jennings. "This was characteristic of
the kind of behavior tha-t's been going
on all year."
Earlier this month, Stoler had led an
effort to recall Mathe because he had
refused to follow a senate resolution to
issue spring fee assessment refunds in
White Plaza.
None of the three senators, who are
Hammer & Coffin members, said they
weiu seriously concerned about Jen
nings'attempt to hold a recall election.
Devine said he thought that getting
upset over this petition "would be like
President Carter being worried be
cause Idi Amin threatens to invade the
United States and cut a path 60 miles
wide from Atlanta to the sea."
Law student King said since his fi
nals wil I be over in two weeks, he con

siders the petition "ridiculous" be
cause "by the time this would go into
effect, our term would be over."
Senate Chairman Dave Sharp agreed
with King, saying he could not foresee
Jennings getting enough signatures to
hold an election. Assuming an elec
tion is held, "we'll be so close to the
end of the quarter that the Elections
Commissioner would probably post
pone the election until fal 1, so it has no
effect on this year's senate," Sharp
said.
"It's funny that he (Jennings) doesn't
see the parallel between what he's
doing and what we did," Stoler com
mented. Stoler explained that by his,

King's and Devine's fake attempt to re
call Mathe, "we were trying to set a
precedent. We never had the intention
of taking his office away from him."
In his letter, Jennings stressed that
"a contrary precedent needs to be es
tablished" to the problem now that
"ASSU senators seem to view them
selves as unaccountable."
Sharp said both senators and COP
members are not accountable.
"Their only accountability is if they
want to run for reelection. On this
basis, the senate is even more account
able than the COP. This is a problem
that is not going to be solved by a peti
tion like this," Sharp added.
