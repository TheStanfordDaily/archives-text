Gas forces oil spill clean-up halt
Stavanger, Norway — A choking concentra
tion of gas yesterday forced an American-led
team to suspend efforts to cap a blown-out well
that has sent millions of gallons of oil gushing
into the North Sea in past four days.
The six-man team, led by two blow-out
specialists from Texas, were evacuated from an
offshore oil platform in Norway's Ekofisk field
after a calm developed, meaning the winds
were no longer dispersing the volatile gas es
caping from the 10,000-foot deep
well. Weather forecasts for today indicated it
might be possible to resume efforts to cap the
runaway well at daybreak.
A reddish scar of crude petroleum fed by oil
sluicing out of the well at about 44,000 gallons
an hour continued spreading from the rig into
the sea. Impaired visibility made precise mea
surements impossible, but the slick split into
two sectors, covering an estimated HO,OOO
acres.
A spokesman for the Oklahoma-based Phil
lips Petroleum do., operator of the Bravo 14
well that burst open during maintenance oper
ations Friday, said the blow-out team of Hoots
Hansen and Richard Hattenberg worked eight
hours on the rig before retreating to a mainte
nance barge called the Choctaw.
Red Adair, the Texas oil fire and blow-out
expert whose firm is in charge of the capping
attempts, has warned of a possible chain reac
tion effect to other North Sea wells if one of the
wells ever catches fire.
Dutch oil experts who surveyed the oil slick
said they felt sure that if the leak is capped
before week's end, the oil will break down be
fore reaching any coast. The Ekofisk field lies
between Norway, Denmark »nd Scotland, and
the slick has drifted in various directions with
changes in the wind.
Local rulings favored on busing
Washington — School officials in Dayton,
Ohio, now forced by a federal court to bus some
J 000 students to achieve racial desegregation,

"should be freeat this point in theirattempt to
make a fine school system," the Supreme Court
was told yesterday.
Dayton attorney David Creer, representing
the city's Board of Education, told the justices
that the lower court's busing order put into
effect last fall should be set aside.
The court's plan to make all six public
schools in Dayton reflect roughly the same ra
cial composition of the school district as a
whole "cannot be justified" as a remedy for the
traces of segregation found after a 1972 suit
was filed, Greer said.
The Supreme Court ruling, expected before
the court term ends in June, could have a tar
reaching effect on the nation's school systems.
A majority of the justices have indicated in
recent rulings that they may be ready to con
fine the power of federal judges to remedy ra
cial desegregation in schools.
The court in recent months has set aside
sweeping busing orders for Austin, Texas, and
Indianapolis schools, sending both cases back
to lower courts with instructions to find more
limited remedies.
In a concurring opinion in the Austin case,
Justice Lewis Powell Jr. said remedies must fit
the amount of discrimination and indicated
the court will require persons charging racial
discrimination to prove discriminatory intent
by school officials.
That requirement differs dramatically from
thecourt's reasoning ina 197' A decision involv
ing a Denver school. The court majority ruled
then that federal judges could order system
wide solutions when they find intentional ra
cial discrimination in part of a school system.
Administration opposes co-ops
Washington — The Carter administration
parted company with consumer groups yes
terday and opposed legislation designed to en
courage development of consumer coopera
tives.
The legislation would establish a new fed
eral agency to make an annual $250 million in

low-interest loans to nonprofit consumer
owned co-ops. Supporters say the loan prog
ram would encourage the growth of food and
service cooperatives.
Consumer groups say the co-ops lower
prices to consumers while industry groups say
they provide unfair competition to businesses
trying to make a profit.
Roger Altman, assistant Treasury
secretary-designate, told Congress yesterday
that the Carter administration wants a two-year
study before determi ni ng whether t he program
should be established.
House rejects pay raise
Washington — The House voted 23H-179 yes
terday for a symbolic rejection of the $12,900
annual pay raise that members of Congress
began receiving in February.
The vote struck from a target budget resolu
tion the funds equivalent to the $7-million cost
of the raise.
Rep. Otis Pike (D-N.Y.), who offered an
amendment to delete the money, left no doubt
that he intended the vote as a test of sentiment
on continuing t he raise. The resolution is to set
spending goals for the year beginning Oct. 1.
Hut chairman Robert Giaimo (D-Conn.) of the
Budget Committee, insisted the vote was not
on the pay raise.
"If you want a vote on the pay raise, you wil I
get it sooner than you think," Giaimo told the
House. "You will get it when we vote on the
appropriation."
The resolution before the House is a prelimi
nary one and not binding. Mandatory spend
ing ceilings for the coming fiscal year will be
set by a second resolution in the fall.
Press allowed in kidnap hearings
Oakland — A Superior Court judge refused
yesterday to bar press and spectators from pret
rial hearings at the Chowchilla mass kidnap
case, but granted defense attornevs a long
delay to appeal his ruling.
Judge Leo Deegan, a retired Riverside
County Superior Court judge assigned to the
case in Alameda County Superior Court, said

that judges should not resort to the extreme
measure of closing court proceedings to the
public unless keeping them open would pose a
"very grave threat to the defense of the trial."
He said he did not believe that keeping pro
ceedings open would present such a threat in
this case.
Deegan denied a second request by two
newspapers to reopen the court record, closed
from public view by an earlier order handed
down in Madera County Superior Court.
Deegan did agree, however, to instruct the
court clerk that only certain parts of the record
in the sensational case should be sealed, in
cluding a grand jury transcript and evidence
obtained in search warrants.
The defense wants the court to throw out the
evidence obtained through a volley of search
warrants issued in the days after the July 15,
197 ft kidnaping of 2B Chowchilla school chil
dren anil their bus driver.
The victims were held captive in a buried
moving van in a Livermore quarry, owned by
defendant Frederick Woods' family. They dug

their way out after 17 hours.
Woods and the two other defendants, James
and Richard Schoenfeld, each were indicted
on 27 counts of kidnaping and 1H counts of
armed robbery. They are being held at the Oak
land Courthouse jail in lieu of $1 million bail
each.
