# Sorority issue may go to board

The Housing Office intends to ask the Board of Trustees
to remove the ban on sororities, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson said last night on KZSU's Campus
Conference.
Robinson said he plans to go to the June meeting to ask
the trustees about revoking the ban. "Having the ban pre
cludes the possibility" of having the option of subjective
selectivity for women, Robinson said.
There is general agreement, he said, "that if we have
fraternities which have the ability to select their own mem
bers, we have to have the same privilege for WDmen."
Robinson added that such housing would not necessarily
have to be called sororities.
When asked about the controversial new flat-rate utility
billing to each student. Robinson said, "I'm not opposed to

having some method of letting each house pay its own
utility fees directly."
But, he said, "savings shouldn't be offset by administra
tive costs incurred in going to the differential billing sys
tem."
Robinson was asked by KZSU newsman Jim Moroney if
the University is "behind the fraternity system." Robinson
responded by saying that "fraternities can be positive living
groups." Neither he nor Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons are "trying to do away with them." Robinson said.
Manzanita Park will be in use a while longer, too, Robin
son said. "We would like to be able to replace" the trailers,
he commented, "but there is no way that we can get rid of
them until we have something else to take their place."
"Otherwise," Robinson said, "we'd be dislodging 450
students."
