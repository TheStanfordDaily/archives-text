# SWOPSI conducts nuclear symposium

Arthur Lall, former Indian represen
tative to a disarmament conference,
will present a view from India tonight
as part of SWOPSI's nuclear prolifera
tion symposium, according to
SWOPSI Codirector Tom Graham.
The four-part symposium, which
runs through next Wednesday, is
being held in conjunction with a
SWOPSI course entitled "Nuclear Pro
liferation: Prospects for Control."
Graham is an instructor and cofoun
der of the class, as well as being coor
dinator of the symposium.
The symposium opened Monday,
with Senior Energy Specialist Warren
Donnelly of the Congressional Re
search Service speaking on the role of
the United States in controlling prolif
eration.
According to Graham, Donnelly said
the United States has grown consider
ably more aware of the problem since
last fall, yet no easy solution is going to
be found.
Graham cited President Jimmy Car
ter's slowdown of the breeder reactor
program as a first step toward control.
Graham said Carter's move was based
on the assumption that "other nations
would follow suit."
The breeder reactor has been

criticized on the grounds that it re
quires substantial amounts of
plutonium and advanced technology
to function, which could instead be
combined to manufacture a bomb.
Students in the SWOPSI class will
prepare a report on the proliferation
problem based on information gleaned
from the symposium and faculty
speeches to the workshop.
These faculty members include
Henry Rowan of the Business School,
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
and delegate to the arms limitation
talks, and Phillip Farley from the Arms
Control and Disarmament Program
here.
Graham said he expects the report to
be "controversial."
The symposium will conclude with
an exploration of the possibilities of
proliferation through terrorism by
Princeton Engineering Prof. Theodore
Taylor on Monday and a panel discus
sion next Wednesday.
The panel will consist of representa
tives of the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission, the Arms Control Associa
tion, the Electric Power Research Insti
tute and Sen. John Glenn's office.
All meetings are held at 7:30 p.m. in
Room 290 of the Law School.
