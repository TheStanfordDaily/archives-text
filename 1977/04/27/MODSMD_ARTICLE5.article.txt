# Taiwanese students here trade spying charges

Some Taiwanese students at Stanford say
they are being watched by other Taiwanese
students acting as government "spies" who
report "disloyal" or "subversive" activities
to Taiwan's government. Others say there is
no evidence to support such allegations.
One thing is certain though. A tense but
quiet struggle exists among Taiwanese stu
dents here.
"If people find out about this interview, I
could be arrested if 1 return to Taiwan," one
Taiwanese student here said in an interview
with the Daily. Some others who were in
terviewed said much the same thing.
All Taiwanese sources asked for anonym
ity because they said they feared reprisals if
they were quoted by name.
One student said he was asked at another
university to help report on fellow
Taiwanese students by a student member of
the Kuomintang (KMT) party, the ruling
Chinese Nationalist party in Taiwan.
The New York Times reported the case of
Ch'en Yu-hui, a former student at the Uni
versity of Hawaii. Ch'en was found by
Taiwanese government agents in Japan,
brought back to Taiwan, and sentenced to
seven years in prison. Ch'en was arrested
because he had been seen reading mainland
Chinese publications while at the univer
sity, the Times said.
Although students critical of Taiwan are
not always treated so harshly by the gov
ernment, those who return home with the
"bandit" label face ridicule in the public
press, difficulty in finding employment and
close watch by the police, according to stu
dents here. Students may be arrested at any
time should the government begin to detect
political instability.
Two Taiwanese students interviewed
here presented another view. One student
said he was a KMT member. The other said
he was not. Both say accounts of surveil

lance activities are only rumors. "I've never
heard or seen any evidence to prove these
rumors true," one student said.
The KMT party member encouraged stu
dents to speak up if they have any evidence
of surveillance activity so they can "clear up
any misunderstandings." The two students
said they have read materials from main
land China, although they regard them as
propagandistic.
Both students admit to a struggle between
two factions of Taiwanese students on
American campuses. They say when
Taiwanese students first come to the United
States they find a somewhat freer atmos
phere here and come in contact with infor
mation critical of the government in
Taiwan.
Some Taiwanese students here criticized
the government openly, the two students
said. When students who support KMT rule
responded to the criticism, they were
labeled "government spies," the two stu
dents said.
Other spies
The other students interviewed, who
claim government informers exist, say they
themselves are often accused of being
"communist spies." And accusations have
continued to fly back and forth.
The KMT party member said that late one
night this year someone painted the words
"KMT spy" on his car because of his open
support for the government.
The non-KMT student interviewed along
with the KMT member said that although he
is not extremely active in politics, he still
feels strongly about supporting the KMT.
The KMT member said he was born on the
mainland and his family fled to Taiwan
after the Communist takeover. Both* his
grandfathers and his five uncles left behind
were killed because they had been landhol
ders.
He said, "I will never forgive the Com
munist Chinese and I will continue to help

the Taiwanese government in whatever way
I can."
The other Taiwanese students inter
viewed nevertheless say they not only fear
for themselves, but also for relatives still in
Taiwan. Parents are notified and sometimes
threatened when their children studying in
the United States have engaged in "unac
ceptable activities."
Students here explained what they be
lieve prompted the surveillance. Prior to
1972. the KMT was already watching sus
pected members of the Taiwan Indepen
dence Movement. The movement, made up
largely of exiles, advocates independence
for Taiwan from both mainland China and
KMT rule.
In 1970, two students from the movement
tried to assassinate Chiang Ching-kuo, the
late President Chiang Kai-shek's son, who
was visiting the United States at the time.
The government continues to denounce and
repress the movement both at home and ab
road, acgording to students here.
In 1972, a dispute with Japan over posses
sion of the small island of Tiao-yu Tai
brought new pressure on the Taiwanese
government. The island had been of little
importance to either country until oil was
discovered in the continental shelf near the
island.
The Taiwanese government backed off
from a confrontation to avoid possible re
percussions from the large Japanese in
vestment in Taiwan, students here
explained.
Taiwanese students in the United States
began to criticize the government openly
and strongly for retreating so readily from
the disputes, students say. Students said the
government then realized they posed a
threat. The government then began shifting
the emphasis of its surveillance network
toward students.

fellow Taiwanese students on college campuses in this country to the Taiwan
government. Students from Taiwan disagree as to whether the government actually
conducts surveillance activities of students.

quiet struggle exists among Taiwanese stu
dents here.
"If people find out about this interview, I
could be arrested if 1 return to Taiwan," one
Taiwanese student here said in an interview
with the Daily. Some others who were in
terviewed said much the same thing.
All Taiwanese sources asked for anonym
ity because they said they feared reprisals if
they were quoted by name.
One student said he was asked at another
university to help report on fellow
Taiwanese students by a student member of
the Kuomintang (KMT) party, the ruling
Chinese Nationalist party in Taiwan.
The New York Times reported the case of
Ch'en Yu-hui, a former student at the Uni
versity of Hawaii. Ch'en was found by
Taiwanese government agents in Japan,
brought back to Taiwan, and sentenced to
seven years in prison. Ch'en was arrested
because he had been seen reading mainland
Chinese publications while at the univer
sity, the Times said.
Although students critical of Taiwan are
not always treated so harshly by the gov
ernment, those who return home with the
"bandit" label face ridicule in the public
press, difficulty in finding employment and
close watch by the police, according to stu
dents here. Students may be arrested at any
time should the government begin to detect
political instability.
Two Taiwanese students interviewed
here presented another view. One student
said he was a KMT member. The other said
he was not. Both say accounts of surveil

lance activities are only rumors. "I've never
heard or seen any evidence to prove these
rumors true," one student said.
The KMT party member encouraged stu
dents to speak up if they have any evidence
of surveillance activity so they can "clear up
any misunderstandings." The two students
said they have read materials from main
land China, although they regard them as
propagandistic.
Both students admit to a struggle between
two factions of Taiwanese students on
American campuses. They say when
Taiwanese students first come to the United
States they find a somewhat freer atmos
phere here and come in contact with infor
mation critical of the government in
Taiwan.
Some Taiwanese students here criticized
the government openly, the two students
said. When students who support KMT rule
responded to the criticism, they were
labeled "government spies," the two stu
dents said.
Other spies
The other students interviewed, who
claim government informers exist, say they
themselves are often accused of being
"communist spies." And accusations have
continued to fly back and forth.
The KMT party member said that late one
night this year someone painted the words
"KMT spy" on his car because of his open
support for the government.
The non-KMT student interviewed along
with the KMT member said that although he
is not extremely active in politics, he still
feels strongly about supporting the KMT.
The KMT member said he was born on the
mainland and his family fled to Taiwan
after the Communist takeover. Both* his
grandfathers and his five uncles left behind
were killed because they had been landhol
ders.
He said, "I will never forgive the Com
munist Chinese and I will continue to help

the Taiwanese government in whatever way
I can."
The other Taiwanese students inter
viewed nevertheless say they not only fear
for themselves, but also for relatives still in
Taiwan. Parents are notified and sometimes
threatened when their children studying in
the United States have engaged in "unac
ceptable activities."
Students here explained what they be
lieve prompted the surveillance. Prior to
1972. the KMT was already watching sus
pected members of the Taiwan Indepen
dence Movement. The movement, made up
largely of exiles, advocates independence
for Taiwan from both mainland China and
KMT rule.
In 1970, two students from the movement
tried to assassinate Chiang Ching-kuo, the
late President Chiang Kai-shek's son, who
was visiting the United States at the time.
The government continues to denounce and
repress the movement both at home and ab
road, acgording to students here.
In 1972, a dispute with Japan over posses
sion of the small island of Tiao-yu Tai
brought new pressure on the Taiwanese
government. The island had been of little
importance to either country until oil was
discovered in the continental shelf near the
island.
The Taiwanese government backed off
from a confrontation to avoid possible re
percussions from the large Japanese in
vestment in Taiwan, students here
explained.
Taiwanese students in the United States
began to criticize the government openly
and strongly for retreating so readily from
the disputes, students say. Students said the
government then realized they posed a
threat. The government then began shifting
the emphasis of its surveillance network
toward students.

This is the form that Kuomintang informers allegedly use for reporting the activities of
fellow Taiwanese students on college campuses in this country to the Taiwan
government. Students from Taiwan disagree as to whether the government actually
conducts surveillance activities of students.
Some Taiwanese students at Stanford say
they are being watched by other Taiwanese
students acting as government "spies" who
report "disloyal" or "subversive" activities
to Taiwan's government. Others say there is
no evidence to support such allegations.

ity because they said they feared reprisals if
they were quoted by name.
One student said he was asked at another
university to help report on fellow
Taiwanese students by a student member of
the Kuomintang (KMT) party, the ruling
Chinese Nationalist party in Taiwan.
The New York Times reported the case of
Ch'en Yu-hui, a former student at the Uni
versity of Hawaii. Ch'en was found by
Taiwanese government agents in Japan,
brought back to Taiwan, and sentenced to
seven years in prison. Ch'en was arrested
because he had been seen reading mainland
Chinese publications while at the univer
sity, the Times said.
Although students critical of Taiwan are
not always treated so harshly by the gov
ernment, those who return home with the
"bandit" label face ridicule in the public
press, difficulty in finding employment and
close watch by the police, according to stu
dents here. Students may be arrested at any
time should the government begin to detect
political instability.
Two Taiwanese students interviewed
here presented another view. One student
said he was a KMT member. The other said
he was not. Both say accounts of surveil

lance activities are only rumors. "I've never
heard or seen any evidence to prove these
rumors true," one student said.
The KMT party member encouraged stu
dents to speak up if they have any evidence
of surveillance activity so they can "clear up
any misunderstandings." The two students
said they have read materials from main
land China, although they regard them as
propagandistic.
Both students admit to a struggle between
two factions of Taiwanese students on
American campuses. They say when
Taiwanese students first come to the United
States they find a somewhat freer atmos
phere here and come in contact with infor
mation critical of the government in
Taiwan.
Some Taiwanese students here criticized
the government openly, the two students
said. When students who support KMT rule
responded to the criticism, they were
labeled "government spies," the two stu
dents said.
Other spies
The other students interviewed, who
claim government informers exist, say they
themselves are often accused of being
"communist spies." And accusations have
continued to fly back and forth.
The KMT party member said that late one
night this year someone painted the words
"KMT spy" on his car because of his open
support for the government.
The non-KMT student interviewed along
with the KMT member said that although he
is not extremely active in politics, he still
feels strongly about supporting the KMT.
The KMT member said he was born on the
mainland and his family fled to Taiwan
after the Communist takeover. Both* his
grandfathers and his five uncles left behind
were killed because they had been landhol
ders.
He said, "I will never forgive the Com
munist Chinese and I will continue to help

the Taiwanese government in whatever way
I can."
The other Taiwanese students inter
viewed nevertheless say they not only fear
for themselves, but also for relatives still in
Taiwan. Parents are notified and sometimes
threatened when their children studying in
the United States have engaged in "unac
ceptable activities."
Students here explained what they be
lieve prompted the surveillance. Prior to
1972. the KMT was already watching sus
pected members of the Taiwan Indepen
dence Movement. The movement, made up
largely of exiles, advocates independence
for Taiwan from both mainland China and
KMT rule.
In 1970, two students from the movement
tried to assassinate Chiang Ching-kuo, the
late President Chiang Kai-shek's son, who
was visiting the United States at the time.
The government continues to denounce and
repress the movement both at home and ab
road, acgording to students here.
In 1972, a dispute with Japan over posses
sion of the small island of Tiao-yu Tai
brought new pressure on the Taiwanese
government. The island had been of little
importance to either country until oil was
discovered in the continental shelf near the
island.
The Taiwanese government backed off
from a confrontation to avoid possible re
percussions from the large Japanese in
vestment in Taiwan, students here
explained.
Taiwanese students in the United States
began to criticize the government openly
and strongly for retreating so readily from
the disputes, students say. Students said the
government then realized they posed a
threat. The government then began shifting
the emphasis of its surveillance network
toward students.
(Tomorrow: reports from other campuses on
KMT informers.)


Keeping an eye on the population? ""*
This is the form that Kuomintang informers allegedly use for reporting the activities of
fellow Taiwanese students on college campuses in this country to the Taiwan
government. Students from Taiwan disagree as to whether the government actually
conducts surveillance activities of students.
