## Opinions Support stock resolutions 
### 
Gray, Jennings

In editing the latter part of our
article on University corporate
investment responsibility
(Daily, April 22) "for brevity,
clarity and style,"apparently the
exigencies of space took prece
dence over the other two de
sideratum, resulting not only in
less clarity and poorer style, but
in the omission of some crucial
content.
These omissions made our
contentions appear nonsensical.
The article as it appeared, for
example, promised to make an
argument for divestiture, but
then it never delivered on the
promise, for the argument itself
had been cut out.
We would like, therefore, to
restate —this time without the
deletions —and take the occa
sion to expand our three distinct
arguments advocating that the
University vote in favor of the
shareholder resolutions calling
for non-expansion or with
drawal from South Africa, and
that the University divest itself
of its stock in these companies if
the resolutions fail to pass.
The first, more moderate ar
gument is that the University's
actions in themselves could
never force these companies to
withdraw from South Africa.
Voting for the resolutions is just
a way to get these corporations to
take some serious steps in
liberalizing their practices in
South Africa.
Re-examine involvement
Divestiture would be espe
cially effective in forcing the
companies to re-examine their
involvement in South Africa be
cause a divestment by the Uni
versity on moral grounds would
have a real (if slight) effect on t he
market standing of even gigantic
firms like General Electric and
General Motors. Divestiture
would be a statement in the only
terms these corporations
u ndersta nd—money.
The second, probably more
far-sighted argument, recog
nizes that mere reform is no

longer possible or adequate in
South Africa. Events are moving
too quickly. The white minority
rule in Rhodesia is collapsing.
In F'rance, South Africa's
major arms supplier, there is a
strong possibility that the left
wil 1 come to power next year and
halt armament shipments to the
Vorster regime, thus cutting
deeply into South Africa's milit
ary muscle.
In every other major foreign
investor nation, there are strong
anti-apartheid movements that
are growing every day. Around
the world, concerned people
who previously despaired at
changing the abhorrent apar
theid system, now draw hope
and inspiration from the South
African blacks themselves, who,
beginning with last summer's
uprisings, have begun to throw
off their own shackles.
Blacks' stand
And what do the South Afri
can blacks themselves say about
foreign investment? Almost
universally they call for ending
it. They know that the only way
they shall ever achieve long
range liberation is by accepting
the temporary suffering that will
result from the withdrawal of
foreign investments.
For every liberalizing step
forward the blacks have seen five
backward in the last few years.
The South African government
is pushing forward to drive
another four million blacks and
coloreds out of the cities onto the
desolate Bantustans in what will
be the greatest forced migration
in peacetime.
The Vorster regime has re
centlyboosted its military/police
budget by 21 per cent. It is pre
paring to fight rather than sac
rifice a standard of living for the
whites, which, built on the backs
of the blacks, is one of the high
est in the world.
This leads us to our final ar
gument, the moral argument.
Until recently the return on U.S.
investment has been higher in

South Africa than in most de
veloping and many developed
countries, and the size of U.S.
investment there has grown
steadily over the last two de
cades.
Blood money
The University is in fact di
rectly, investing in South Africa
through these companies The
return on that investment is un
deniably enhanced by the fact
that the black population of
South Africa is virtual slave
labor. This is blood money and,
every other argument aside, we
should have none of it.
Lest this sound like mere
rhetoric, it should not be forgot
ten that everyday life—and
death—is a nightmare for the
blacks in South Africa. Statistics
can only begin to convey the full
picture. The whites, making up
less than 20 per cent of the popu
lation, own 87 per cent of the
land.
Over a thousand blacks are ar
rested each day and fined a
month's wages for pass book vio
»atons. Since June, over 500
blacks have been shot down in
the streets. Six thousand blacks
have been arrested. At least 18
have died in prison—Amnesty
International says they were tor
tured to death. Infant mortality
among blacks is almost 50 per
cent.
For us, these and other
speakable horrors of the most
virulently racist society on earth
demand serious action. This
University's money is giving di
rect support to the racist —many
would say downright fascist—
regime in South Africa. The very
least the University could do is
support the shareholder resolu
tions calling for withdrawal
from South Africa and divest its
stock in those companies that
fail to withdraw.
