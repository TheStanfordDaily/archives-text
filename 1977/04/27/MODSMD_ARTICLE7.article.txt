## 'Kidporn,' quarter system 
### 
Feminist slogans
About Shannon Blando's col
umn on "kidporn": I can see the
reason for specific indignation
but why the broadside against
men?
There is also a lively tradition
of adult female sexuality di
rected to children, exploiting
them if you will. You can find
references to this in Rabelais,
Colette, etc.
Far graver than this imbalance
in her remarks is the failure to
understand the complementary
role of the sexes. Men, tradition
al ly, have been drawn to both the
upper (superego) pole of the
psyche and the lower, the id,
more than women.
This is their characteristic
strength and compensatory vul
nerability. Mature women have
always understood this, even as
they all-too-humanly called men
"dogs" (common in my day).
Maybe all this will change,
though I doubt it; recent signs
indicate otherwise. In any event,
chip-on-the-shoulder feminist
slogans won't help anything.

Critical thinking
Since arriving at Stanford, I
have given much thought to the
advantages and disadvantages of
the semester system vis-a-vis the
present quarter system. After
months of introspection, I can
only conclude that the quarter
system stunts intellectual
creativity and initiative, and
causes undue pressure on the
student.
Of course, we are all familiar
with the arguments for and
against the semester system. We
all know that the possibility of
change has been studied previ
ously.
I am reminded of the many
speeches which all freshmen
hear at one time or another dur
ing their first weeks here.
Professors and administrators
alike proclaim a purpose of an
education here to be the de
velopment of critical reading,
writing and thinking abilities.
But I wonder how one learns
to do anything "critically" with
out sufficient time to synthesize
material, or even to think about
thinking critically. Each one of
us knows all too well the time

constraints which are such an
inherent part of the present sys
tem.
After examining the question
of a semester system, I would
hope that enough interest wil 1 be
generated to begin to study the
potentiality for change. Perhaps
we will learn that the quarter
system remains the only viable
system, but, in the process, we
will learn something about criti
cal thinking which is, after all,
one of the tenets of a Stanford
education.

As a Stanford old-timer, I am
interested in a statement in the
April 20 issue of the Daily which
reporter Randy David attributed
to Ombudsman John Goheen.
The article ("Provost Advocates
Chem Grade Change") states that
"until 1974 professors' grade
decisions were final."
Such a rule may indeed have
been on the books and was prob
ably enforced where the grades
in question were awarded by te
nured members of the faculty.
But, for the untenured, such a
rule was not operative, at least
during the late 19205.
A case I vividly recall con
cerned the awarding of "D" to a
student who conceivably should
have been flunked. Naturally,
then, the class teacher was
amazed and outraged to learn
that the grade had been changed
to a "B" by the executive head of
her department (not the present
writer's department).
Strong protests only elicited
the statement that a decision
made by a department head was
final and no reasons for his deci
sion need by given. It may have
been only a coincidence that the
father of the student was a very
close friend of the department
chairman.

Smokescreens
When confronted with dif
ficult and complex issues and
when trying to convince others
of one side of the argument or the
other, we often find it useful to
divert the focus of the dispute
away from the real issues and
toward other, more black-and

white issues. Marko Kong's col
umn (Daily, April 22) is an excel
lent example of this.
In that column, Fong chose to
interpret the issue over marine
recruiting as one of free speech
or free assembly: "No matter
what the marine recruiter came
to preach, as an American in
America, he had a right to say
it."
By alluding to the guarantees
of the Bill of Rights (over which
most Americans are in agree
ment), Fong has ennobled the
marine recruiter's activity by
shrouding him in the American
flag and Constitution.
Let us not be confused by this
mistake. What is at stake here is
not the recruiter's right to es
pouse a strong national defense,
machismo, discipline or the
superiority of American democ
racy to godless communism.
In fact, if that is the marine
recruiter's objective, he can stay
home, since many University fa
culty and athletic coaches indoc
trinate students with those same
values already, without his help.
Let us not be misled, I say, by
those who pronounce "come
one, come all" to all points of
view: the guarantee of free
speech is not at issue here. The
marine recruiter uses the Career
Planning and Placement Center
to recruit, to attract students into
the marines: and it is by no
means clear that he has a right to
do so.
This, then, is the issueat hand:
given the evidence of the
marines' imperialist activities in
the Dominican Republic. Cuba
and Indochina, of the racism
which is tacitly encouraged
within the corps and of the
human "qualities" which the
marines espouse (blind obedi
ence, merciless brutality, na
tional and sexual chauvinism),
does the University choose to aid
and abet those activities and at
titudes by permitting its
facilities to be used for the pur
pose of attracting students into
that career?
This is the issue, not the de
magogic smokescreens which
have been put forth by others. If
we are to debate this issue at all,
let us debate it on relevant
grounds.

Critical thinking
Since arriving at Stanford, I
have given much thought to the
advantages and disadvantages of
the semester system vis-a-vis the
present quarter system. After
months of introspection, I can
only conclude that the quarter
system stunts intellectual
creativity and initiative, and
causes undue pressure on the
student.
Of course, we are all familiar
with the arguments for and
against the semester system. We
all know that the possibility of
change has been studied previ
ously.
I am reminded of the many
speeches which all freshmen
hear at one time or another dur
ing their first weeks here.
Professors and administrators
alike proclaim a purpose of an
education here to be the de
velopment of critical reading,
writing and thinking abilities.
But I wonder how one learns
to do anything "critically" with
out sufficient time to synthesize
material, or even to think about
thinking critically. Each one of
us knows all too well the time

constraints which are such an
inherent part of the present sys
tem.
After examining the question
of a semester system, I would
hope that enough interest wil 1 be
generated to begin to study the
potentiality for change. Perhaps
we will learn that the quarter
system remains the only viable
system, but, in the process, we
will learn something about criti
cal thinking which is, after all,
one of the tenets of a Stanford

As a Stanford old-timer, I am
interested in a statement in the
April 20 issue of the Daily which
reporter Randy David attributed
to Ombudsman John Goheen.
The article ("Provost Advocates
Chem Grade Change") states that
"until 1974 professors' grade
decisions were final."
Such a rule may indeed have
been on the books and was prob
ably enforced where the grades
in question were awarded by te
nured members of the faculty.
But, for the untenured, such a
rule was not operative, at least
during the late 19205.
A case I vividly recall con
cerned the awarding of "D" to a
student who conceivably should
have been flunked. Naturally,
then, the class teacher was
amazed and outraged to learn
that the grade had been changed
to a "B" by the executive head of
her department (not the present
writer's department).
Strong protests only elicited
the statement that a decision
made by a department head was
final and no reasons for his deci

been only a coincidence that the
father of the student was a very
close friend of the department

Smokescreens
When confronted with dif
ficult and complex issues and
when trying to convince others
of one side of the argument or the
other, we often find it useful to
divert the focus of the dispute
away from the real issues and
toward other, more black-and

white issues. Marko Kong's col
umn (Daily, April 22) is an excel
lent example of this.
In that column, Fong chose to
interpret the issue over marine
recruiting as one of free speech
or free assembly: "No matter
what the marine recruiter came
to preach, as an American in
America, he had a right to say
it."
By alluding to the guarantees
of the Bill of Rights (over which
most Americans are in agree
ment), Fong has ennobled the
marine recruiter's activity by
shrouding him in the American
flag and Constitution.
Let us not be confused by this
mistake. What is at stake here is
not the recruiter's right to es
pouse a strong national defense,
machismo, discipline or the
superiority of American democ
racy to godless communism.
In fact, if that is the marine
recruiter's objective, he can stay
home, since many University fa
culty and athletic coaches indoc
trinate students with those same
values already, without his help.
Let us not be misled, I say, by
those who pronounce "come
one, come all" to all points of
view: the guarantee of free
speech is not at issue here. The
marine recruiter uses the Career
Planning and Placement Center
to recruit, to attract students into
the marines: and it is by no
means clear that he has a right to
do so.
This, then, is the issueat hand:
given the evidence of the
marines' imperialist activities in
the Dominican Republic. Cuba
and Indochina, of the racism
which is tacitly encouraged
within the corps and of the
human "qualities" which the
marines espouse (blind obedi
ence, merciless brutality, na
tional and sexual chauvinism),
does the University choose to aid
and abet those activities and at
titudes by permitting its
facilities to be used for the pur
pose of attracting students into
that career?
This is the issue, not the de

advantages and disadvantages of
the semester system vis-a-vis the
present quarter system. After
months of introspection, I can
only conclude that the quarter
system stunts intellectual
creativity and initiative, and
causes undue pressure on the
student.
Of course, we are all familiar
with the arguments for and
against the semester system. We
all know that the possibility of
change has been studied previ
ously.
I am reminded of the many
speeches which all freshmen
hear at one time or another dur
ing their first weeks here.
Professors and administrators
alike proclaim a purpose of an
education here to be the de
velopment of critical reading,
writing and thinking abilities.
But I wonder how one learns
to do anything "critically" with
out sufficient time to synthesize
material, or even to think about
thinking critically. Each one of
us knows all too well the time

constraints which are such an
inherent part of the present sys
tem.
After examining the question
of a semester system, I would
hope that enough interest wil 1 be
generated to begin to study the
potentiality for change. Perhaps
we will learn that the quarter
system remains the only viable
system, but, in the process, we
will learn something about criti
cal thinking which is, after all,
one of the tenets of a Stanford
education.

As a Stanford old-timer, I am
interested in a statement in the
April 20 issue of the Daily which
reporter Randy David attributed
to Ombudsman John Goheen.
The article ("Provost Advocates
Chem Grade Change") states that
"until 1974 professors' grade
decisions were final."
Such a rule may indeed have
been on the books and was prob
ably enforced where the grades
in question were awarded by te
nured members of the faculty.
But, for the untenured, such a
rule was not operative, at least
during the late 19205.
A case I vividly recall con
cerned the awarding of "D" to a
student who conceivably should
have been flunked. Naturally,
then, the class teacher was
amazed and outraged to learn
that the grade had been changed
to a "B" by the executive head of
her department (not the present
writer's department).
Strong protests only elicited
the statement that a decision
made by a department head was
final and no reasons for his deci
sion need by given. It may have
been only a coincidence that the
father of the student was a very
close friend of the department
chairman.

Smokescreens
When confronted with dif
ficult and complex issues and
when trying to convince others
of one side of the argument or the
other, we often find it useful to
divert the focus of the dispute
away from the real issues and
toward other, more black-and

white issues. Marko Kong's col
umn (Daily, April 22) is an excel
lent example of this.
In that column, Fong chose to
interpret the issue over marine
recruiting as one of free speech
or free assembly: "No matter
what the marine recruiter came
to preach, as an American in
America, he had a right to say
it."
By alluding to the guarantees
of the Bill of Rights (over which
most Americans are in agree
ment), Fong has ennobled the
marine recruiter's activity by
shrouding him in the American
flag and Constitution.
Let us not be confused by this
mistake. What is at stake here is
not the recruiter's right to es
pouse a strong national defense,
machismo, discipline or the
superiority of American democ
racy to godless communism.
In fact, if that is the marine
recruiter's objective, he can stay
home, since many University fa
culty and athletic coaches indoc
trinate students with those same
values already, without his help.
Let us not be misled, I say, by
those who pronounce "come
one, come all" to all points of
view: the guarantee of free
speech is not at issue here. The
marine recruiter uses the Career
Planning and Placement Center
to recruit, to attract students into
the marines: and it is by no
means clear that he has a right to
do so.
This, then, is the issueat hand:
given the evidence of the
marines' imperialist activities in
the Dominican Republic. Cuba
and Indochina, of the racism
which is tacitly encouraged
within the corps and of the
human "qualities" which the
marines espouse (blind obedi
ence, merciless brutality, na
tional and sexual chauvinism),
does the University choose to aid
and abet those activities and at
titudes by permitting its
facilities to be used for the pur
pose of attracting students into
that career?
This is the issue, not the de
magogic smokescreens which
have been put forth by others. If
we are to debate this issue at all,
let us debate it on relevant
grounds.

Feminist slogans
About Shannon Blando's col
umn on "kidporn": I can see the
reason for specific indignation
but why the broadside against
men?
There is also a lively tradition
of adult female sexuality di
rected to children, exploiting
them if you will. You can find
references to this in Rabelais,
Colette, etc.
Far graver than this imbalance
in her remarks is the failure to
understand the complementary
role of the sexes. Men, tradition
al ly, have been drawn to both the
upper (superego) pole of the
psyche and the lower, the id,
more than women.
This is their characteristic
strength and compensatory vul
nerability. Mature women have
always understood this, even as
they all-too-humanly called men
"dogs" (common in my day).
Maybe all this will change,
though I doubt it; recent signs
indicate otherwise. In any event,
chip-on-the-shoulder feminist
slogans won't help anything.
