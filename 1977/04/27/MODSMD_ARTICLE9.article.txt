# Switch focus from victimless crimes
## 
### 
The Libertarian Party has been
leading the fight to legalize "vic
timless" crimes, which is an ef
fort that everyone, especially
conservatives should vigorously
support.
The prohibition of victimless
crimes, that is criminal activity
which leaves no victims, illus
trates a mixture of intolerance to
diversity, and myopic gov
ernmental paternalism to protect
people from their own alleged
incompetence and poor judg
ment.
Gonservatives have quite
rightly opposed most of the ab
surd forms of governmental in
terference, but have all too fre
quently forgotten that "moral be
liefs concerning matters of con
duct which do not directly inter
fere with the protected sphere of
other persons do not justify con
cern." (Friedrich von Hayek).
Governmental interference
with the rights of adults to live
their own lives in their own
ways is legitimate only when
those activities deleteriously af
fect society, and the rights of
others.
Interference predicated upon
the protection of'someone "from
themself," or upon a distaste for
someone's private mores, is an
tithetical to a free society, and
the notion that your life is your
own, not the government's.
Laws against certain forms of
gambling, private sexual con
duct, and drug use are the most
prevalent forms of governmental
interference on "moral issues,"

and they have rightly come
under increasing attack.
Social consequences
However, at this point, those
in favor of such regulations are
likely to interject that these ac
tivities do leave victims. It is in
fact true that most activities do
have some effect on the rest of
society, given the interrelated
ness of our society.
Gambling is the area with the
widest social approval of legali
zation. This is in part the result
of the recognition that the objec
tions to gambling are essentially
moral in nature. Gambling may
be wasteful, silly, and personally
harmful, but the effects on soci
ety are not so egregious as to
warrant suppression.
Personal feelings are also not
germane to government regula
tion of sexual activities. Though
I morally object to homosexual
activity and prostitution, I can
not support government inter
ference with these private
cosensual activities.
Any possible interest in pre
venting private homosexual
contacts between consenting
adults is infinitesimal compared
to the outrageous nature of the
government interference with an
intensely private act.
Prostitution
Prostitution is a more difficult
issue, since the effects on society
tend to be greater. Yet its possi
bly deleterious effects could
probably be better controlled if
the activity was not ineffectively
suppressed and pushed under

ground.
Again, we are faced with an
activity that is morally repulsive
to many. But the freedom of the
individual must not be weighed
against personal abhorrence of
the activity, but its social costs.
The suppression of drug use is
another major area of con
troversy. Government regulation
in this area borders on the absurd
with the suppression of the use
of laetrile (apricot pits). Though
medical evidence suggests that

laetrile is ineffective in treating
cancer, there is no evidence that
it is harmful.
The idea of the decriminaliza
tion of marijuana use has been
growing in respectability. Ore
gon led the way in 1973, and
seven other states have followed.
The fact that no significant in
crease in use has been reported
in those states, and that an esti
mated 50 million Americans
have tried it, shows the ineffec
tiveness of the government's at
tempts at suppression.
It is not unreasonable to con
clude that parents and other au
thorities could more effectively
control marijuana use by minors
if it was legal (Psychology To
day, December 1976).
The justification for the sup
pression is its alleged danger
ousness. There are dozens of
conflicting studies on the possi
bility of sexual impairment,
psychosis, brain damage,
chromosome damage, birth de
fects, and amotivational syn
drome.
Though the potential of
dangerousness is enough to dis
suade me from trying, or using it
(in addition to its illegality), I
can't help but note the difference
in the conclusiveness of the evi
dence of the danger of cigarettes.
Most of my fellow conserva
tives would balk at the thought
of banning cigarettes — anf
rightly so. Cigarette smoking
should be prohibited when it
would endanger the lives of
others (e.g., in public places),
but individuals have the right to
decide to risk death by smoking.
Individual rights
Deaths and health care costs
pose substantial social burdens,

but the right of the individual
outweighs those costs. The same
should go for marijuana. It may
vei y well be'dangerous, but
shouldn't competent adults have
the right to weigh the risks and
choose themselves?
In the case of marijuana,
Daniel X. Freedman of the Uni
versity of Chicago accurately
noted that "Nobody can tell you
it's harmless. Each person must
decide for himself what he wants
to do."
Again, the social costs must be
carefully weighed against the
rights of individuals for self
determination. Suppression is
not valid because something is
in some sense morally "bad,"
but only if such suppression is
necessary to protect the society
and the rights of others.
Another consideration, which
is quite pragmatic, is that the
opportunity costs of suppressing
victimless crimes must be taken
into account. In other words,
how many "victim-filled"
crimes have been committed
while the police and courts were
suppressing victimless crimes?
It has been estimated that fully
1/3 of the nine million plus ar
rests each year are for victimless
crimes — too many by any stan
dard. The states which have
legalized or decriminalized var
ious victimless crimes have
found that the switch of re
sources to violent crimes has
freed police and judges to fight
violent crime, and jail space for
serious offenders.
Norval Morris, dean of the
University of Chicago Law
School and an expert on victim
less crimes, has noted that,
"Many states have come to
realize that it's difficult if not
impossible to fight serious crime
and still enforce laws on pot
smoking and drunkenness."
Thus our society, especially
my fellow conservatives, must
face the issue of victimless
crimes. Governmental interfer
ence is not justified by intoler
ance of diversity, or stupid gov
ernmental paternalism. Rather,
it is only justified if the right to
individual freedom is out
weighed by the social costs of it.
And this equation of interests
must reflect the shortage of law
enforcement resources and the
rising incidence of crime. The
suppression of violent crime de
serves priority — I personally
fear the murderer more than the
prostitute, the armed robber
more than the pot smoker, and
therapist mOrethan thegambler.
