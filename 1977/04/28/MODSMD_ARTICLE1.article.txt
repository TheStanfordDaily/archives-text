# GOP thrust parried, tax cut passed
## 
### 
WashingtonAP)—The Senate defeated
two Republican proposals for perma
nent income tax cuts yesterday and
then voted a new tax break for persons
who provide a home for an elderly de
pendent.
The defeat of the GOP proposals oc
curred as Senate Democrats rallied to
President Jimmy Carter.
And Carter won another fiscal vic
tory when the House, considering a
draft budget for next year, restored
$4.1 billion in authority for the De
fense Department. The action brought
military spending back to Carter's re
commended level of $120.1 billion
after the Budget Committee had voted
to reduce it.
On a 44 to 31 vote, the Senate
adopted an amendment by Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) that would allow a
tax credit of $250 a year for a person
who keeps a dependent 65 years or
older in his home. The provision, if it
becomes law, would be retroactive to
Jan. 1, 1977.
Domenici said the $430 million es
timated cost of the amendment was
misleading—that the proposal actu
ally would save the government
money by cutting down federal spend
ing for housing and medical care for
the elderly.
The House acted after being told
Carter had personally made a last
minute appeal to Speaker Thomas
O'Neill for his defense estimate. The
vote was 225 to 184.
The Senate action supported Carter
in his insistence that further perma
nent tax cuts should await a promised
thorough tax reform proposal later this
year. The president said he would veto
any measures passed now that contain
such cuts.
The Senate rejected, 58 to 39, a GOP
proposal that would have cut rates on
taxable incomes below $20,000, with

most relief going to taxpayers in
middle-and lower-income brackets.
Flat cut
The Senate then defeated, 62 to 32, a
second Republican proposal for a flat
10 per cent cut in all individual in
come tax rates.
In their arguments for tax cuts, Se
nate Republicans hit hard at the
themes that Carter's stimulus package
now contains little for what they called
the overburdened middle-income tax
payer and that high taxation is dam
pening business confidence needed
for job-creating investments.
Democrats responded that the
Shimulus bill is not the proper vehicle
for major permanent tax changes and
that the Republican proposals have no
chance of becoming law.
Carter has said he would veto any

tax cut now, and instead has urged that
consideration of tax reduction await
his tax reform proposals in the future.
"It was a mistake to first offer the $50
rebates and then withdraw them and
offer nothing in their place," said Se
nate Republican Leader Howard Baker
of Tennessee. "It left us with no alter
native but the Republican initiative."
But Chairman Russell Long of the
Finance Committee said that even if
the Senate were to agree to the Repub
lican proposals, the House would
never accept them.
However, Carter's policy suffered a
potential setback when the Senate
Budget Committee, working on the
fiscal plan for the present year, left
room that could be used for a
Republican-style tax cut.
As originally adopted, the 1977

budget resolution provided for the $50
tax rebates and other payments to most
Americans that Carter had proposed.
After the president withdrew the
proposal, citing an improving
economy, his economic spokesmen
began urging Congress to "close the
hole" left by the end of the rebate plan
so there would be less temptation to
use the leeway for new spending.
The House Budget committee ad
justed the revenue figure accordingly.
But the Senate committee voted 10 to
three yesterday to retain almost the
original revenue estimates.
If the Senate committee's recom
mendation holds up when Congress
takes final action, the resulting budget
could accommodate a permanent tax
cut or revival of the payments plan if
the economy were judged to need it.

"It was a mistake to first offer the $50
rebates and then withdraw them and

of Tennessee. "It left us with no alter
native but the Republican initiative."
But Chairman Russell Long of the
Finance Committee said that even if
the Senate were to agree to the Repub
lican proposals, the House would
never accept them.
However, Carter's policy suffered a
potential setback when the Senate
Budget Committee, working on the
fiscal plan for the present year, left
room that could be used for a
Republican-style tax cut.
As originally adopted, the 1977

budget resolution provided for the $50
tax rebates and other payments to most
Americans that Carter had proposed.
After the president withdrew the
proposal, citing an improving
economy, his economic spokesmen
began urging Congress to "close the
hole" left by the end of the rebate plan
so there would be less temptation to
use the leeway for new spending.
The House Budget committee ad
justed the revenue figure accordingly.
But the Senate committee voted 10 to
three yesterday to retain almost the
original revenue estimates.
If the Senate committee's recom

takes final action, the resulting budget
could accommodate a permanent tax
cut or revival of the payments plan if
the economy were judged to need it.

WashingtonAP)—The Senate defeated
two Republican proposals for perma
nent income tax cuts yesterday and
then voted a new tax break for persons
who provide a home for an elderly de
pendent.
The defeat of the GOP proposals oc
curred as Senate Democrats rallied to
President Jimmy Carter.
And Carter won another fiscal vic
tory when the House, considering a
draft budget for next year, restored
$4.1 billion in authority for the De
fense Department. The action brought
military spending back to Carter's re
commended level of $120.1 billion
after the Budget Committee had voted
to reduce it.
On a 44 to 31 vote, the Senate
adopted an amendment by Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) that would allow a
tax credit of $250 a year for a person
who keeps a dependent 65 years or
older in his home. The provision, if it
becomes law, would be retroactive to
Jan. 1, 1977.
Domenici said the $430 million es
timated cost of the amendment was
misleading—that the proposal actu
ally would save the government
money by cutting down federal spend
ing for housing and medical care for
the elderly.
The House acted after being told
Carter had personally made a last
minute appeal to Speaker Thomas
O'Neill for his defense estimate. The
vote was 225 to 184.
The Senate action supported Carter
in his insistence that further perma
nent tax cuts should await a promised
thorough tax reform proposal later this
year. The president said he would veto
any measures passed now that contain
such cuts.
The Senate rejected, 58 to 39, a GOP
proposal that would have cut rates on
taxable incomes below $20,000, with

most relief going to taxpayers in
middle-and lower-income brackets.
Flat cut
The Senate then defeated, 62 to 32, a
second Republican proposal for a flat
10 per cent cut in all individual in
come tax rates.
In their arguments for tax cuts, Se
nate Republicans hit hard at the
themes that Carter's stimulus package
now contains little for what they called
the overburdened middle-income tax
payer and that high taxation is dam
pening business confidence needed
for job-creating investments.
Democrats responded that the
Shimulus bill is not the proper vehicle
for major permanent tax changes and
that the Republican proposals have no
chance of becoming law.
Carter has said he would veto any

tax cut now, and instead has urged that
consideration of tax reduction await
his tax reform proposals in the future.
"It was a mistake to first offer the $50
rebates and then withdraw them and
offer nothing in their place," said Se
