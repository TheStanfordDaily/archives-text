# Fong's marines' protest reporting

I feel it's imperative to re
spond to the many half-truths
and misrepresenttaions of fact
which Marko Fong's column
(Daily, April 22) on the marine/
South African Investment de
monstration contained. Except
for his arguments against the use
of non-violent civil disobedi
ence, most of Fong's points were
discussed fairly. What I most
take issue with, however, is
Fong's biased reporting of the
events upon which he based his
article, which seemed an at
tempt to portray 200 peaceful
students as an extremist
paramilitary organization.
Fong cited Dr. Martin Luther
King's Atlanta bus boycott as an
argument against nonviolent re
sistance, because "boycotters
never physically prevented any
one from using a bus." He failed

to mention, however, that not
only King, but other leaders such
as Mahatma Ghandi and Cesar
Chavez have often employed
civil disobedience to publicize
their convictions — King led
numerous sit-ins which pre
vented patrons from entering
segregated restaurants, and il
legal marches which blocked
streets.
No physical threat
Activist leaders had spoken
with the marine that morning to
inform him that a symbolic act of
resistance would be taken. The
demonstrators who linked arms
at the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) were
by no means a physical threat to
him — indeed, they were risking
their own safety in the face of
trained police who could, and
did, use violence against them.

This brings me to my main
criticism of Fong's journalistic
techniques: his rather jaundiced
word choice in accounts of the
demonstrators' conduct.
Fong used the term "phalanx"
to describe 35 people standing
arm-in-arm before the door; to
normal eyes they looked more
like a Balkan folk dance group
than a battle line of soldiers.
He depicted the arguing bicyc
list as "surrounded" by a
"horde" whose strongest
counter-argument was "physi
cal intimidation." It's true some
people shouted at the cyclist, but
they didn't try to shout him
down. They quieted to let him
speak when he wanted to. Fong
certainly wouldn't have been
able to recount the cyclist's
words if 15 people had been
drowning the man out with sh
outs. Moreover, the word "sur
rounded" is rarely invoked to
describe confrontation by a loose
semicircle of people . . . and I'm
sure the cyclist didn't feel en
dangered in the least.
Word choice
Now for what can only be con
strued as a deliberate slander:
"Meanwhile, the rest of the de
monstrators marched in tight
rank and file with military pre
cision down to the trustees meet
ing. I last heard thebattaJion vot
ing on whether it should march
chanting or clapping. I suspect
they settled on something like
'Hup, two, three four.' " The stu
dents had voted to walk three
and four abreast in order to ap
pear peacefully organized,
rather than as an unruly mob,
just as Martin Luther King's pro
testers had marched in the
South. Anyone who saw the
photos in recent issues of Cam
pus Report or the Stanford Ob
server could see how aptly
"tight rank and file with military
precision" describes men and
women clapping, conversing,
and definitely not marching in
step or in tight columns. Finally,
unlike more professional jour
nalists from the Observer and
Campus Report, Fong didn't
stick around to witness the "bat
talion" vote to enter the R&D

building quietly and leave
chanting only if the trustees re
fused to meet with two student
representatives.
Officials 'safe'
I might add that after the trus
tee meeting, Chairman of the
Board Peter Bing and officials
including President Lyman felt
safe enough to appear before the
"horde," or "battalion," and
hear a list of demands read,
without even donning bullet
proof vests. By a consensus
among the protesters they were
neither insulted, cat-called, nor
shouted at once during the half
hour Bing spent conversing with
them.
Because I'm a creative writing
major I'm acutely aware of how
choice of heavily colored words
can subtly influence a reader's
mood. Fong has a right to air his
opinions on civil disobedience,
but in documenting events he
should strive for objectivity, in-

stead of building his arguments
upon slanted journalism.
Over zealousness
The main point of Fong's arti
cle is excellent —that wellmean
ing people can become over
zealous and behave irresponsi
bly, thus weakening a basically
good cause. (I contend that the
demonstrators in this case be
haved reasonably.) But Fong's
misrepresentation of facts upon
whicb his points are based
weakens what might have
otherwise been a well-written ar
ticle.
All of us who participated in
the demonstration were firmly
committed to non-violence. I re
sent Fong's couched attempt to
undermine our efforts to unify
the community on a crucial is
sue, and appeal to him to please
be a little fairer to peaceful, con
cerned people next time around.
