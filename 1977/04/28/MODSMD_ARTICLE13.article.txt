# Mass burial for 114 victims of Canary Islands plane crash
## 
### 
Westminister (AP) — Exactly one month after the
jumbo jet collision that took 590 lives, the 114
bodies that could not be identified will be buried
together in a mass grave at an Orange County
cemetery.
An interdenominational memorial service was
scheduled before the victims were to be buried at
Westminster Memorial Park, which donated the
75-foot by 75-foot gravesite. A single plaque will
list the dead. About 75 of the 114 unidentified
bodies were determined to be from Southern
California.
The March 27 collision between a Pan Am 747
and a KLM 747 on the runway at Santa Cruz de
Tenerife in the Canary Islands killed 330 Ameri
cans on the Pan Am aircraft and all 250 people on
board the Dutch jet. Sixty-six persons survived the
crash.
The crash, which occurred on a fog-shrouded

runway on the island off West Africa, apparently
resulted from a communications mixup between
the pilots and the Spanish control tower.
The English-speaking air traffic controllers
never gave clearance for takeoff to the KLM jet,
according to a tape recording of the instructions
recovered from the crash site, yet the Dutch pilot
apparently was under the impression he had been
given clear.) nee and began speeding up for takeoff.
The Pan Am jetliner was still moving toward the
KLM jet, which it had been following into position
for takeoff. The Dutch plane lifted off partially,
sheering the top of the Pan Am jumbo jet.
Thirty-seven persons aboard the Pan Am plan
were all from the same Southern California retire
ment community of Leisure World nestled in the
rolling Laguna Hills about 15 miles southeast of
the cemetery here.
Only 10 survived.
