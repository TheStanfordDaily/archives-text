# Students protest tuition increases
## 
### 
(CPS) — Nearly 2000 angry
University of Miami (UM) stu
dents converged on the school's
central administration building
April 20, demonstrating against
the administration's alleged fai
lure to adequately justify a re
cent tuition increase.
The building, Ashe House,
was occupied by almost 300 stu
dents armed with 40 loaves of
bread and a good supply of
peanut butter and jelly.
Soon after the students en
tered Ashe House, UM President
Henry Stanford summoned
police. After several hours of un
successful negotiating, 30 stu
dents, including Student Body
President Susan Havey, were ar
rested.
According to Alan Mar'cus,
editor-in-chief of the campus
newspaper, the students were

protesting a tuition hike of $200
for the 1977-78 academic year,
which was the fifth increase im
posed by the UM Board of Trus
tees during the last six years.
In all, the tuition at UM has
escalated by $1200 since 1970-
71, resulting in the current an
nual fee of $3500 for under
graduates enrolled at the "pri
vate, international, independent
university," as the official let
terhead reads.
Marcus said the turnout was
"earth-shattering for UM" and
explained that the student's
principal demand was that the
Board of Trustees and president
set up a meeting with student
representatives to discuss the
tuition jump and justify its
necessity by producing the
school's itemized budget charts.
During the week of April 11,
Havey and other members of the
student government asked Stan
ford to meet with them at the
president's office so that the
trustees could present the
budget and specify why it was
necessary for the university to
increase tuition once again, said
Marcus.
Stanford felt nothing would
come of such a meeting, saying
that he'd "already made broad
budgetary material available,"
hut offered to speak with the
student leaders at the campus
cafeteria April 15.
Disagreeing, Havey and about
23 others, Marcus reported,
staged a sit-in for more than six
hours at Stanford's office in
Ashe House while the president

waited, symbolically, at the
cafeteria for two hours.
Negotiations stopped entirely
and nothing more was ac
complished, said Marcus, until
the mass demonstration and
siege of Ashe.
Although the demonstration
was peaceful, Marcus said Stan
ford called police on campus.
Nine squad cars and one paddy
wagon arrived with about 20 of
ficers. A spokesman for the Coral
Gables police said some 60 city
policemen and 12 county riot
squad officers were also availa
ble and on standby.
Many of the students in the
building left quietly when told
they would be arrested. How
ever, Havey, released on $500
bond, says about 120 stayed.
Havey was first to be arrested.
A reporter on the scene quoted
her as saying: "I believe the stu
dent body here. 1 can't believe
the administration chose not to
meet with us. 1 love everyone
here because they had the cour
age to stand up for what they be
lieved."
Although a dramatic show,
Marcus explained, "Except for
the students getting busted, no
thing's happened. The president
says he'll meet with them but be
lieves there was 'no merit to the
protest,' and still hasn't agreed
to allow student review of the
budget."
In a related incident, more
than 2500 students of New
York's state and city university
systems' marched into New
York's capital city March 20, to

protest Governor John Carey's
proposed budget which cuts full
"funding of the state Tuition As
sistance Program that many stu
dents, unable to win scholar
ships or produce enough money
to cover tuition, have relied
upon.
And at the University of Mon
tana in Missoula where non
resident tuition is to be in
creased by $400 and resident by
$36, campus newspaper Editor
Barbara Miller said that two
philosophy students had pre
pared a petition that asks the
Board of Regents to justify the
need for the hike.
Well above 2500 signatures
have been gathered, Miller re
ported, ard on April 28 the two
independent organizers plan to
lead a column of students to the
post office when they mail the
completed petitions to the re
gents.
"The tuition situation should
get more and more interesting as
things go on," she said.

(CPS) — Nearly 2000 angry
University of Miami (UM) stu
dents converged on the school's
central administration building
April 20, demonstrating against
the administration's alleged fai
lure to adequately justify a re
cent tuition increase.
The building, Ashe House,
was occupied by almost 300 stu
dents armed with 40 loaves of
bread and a good supply of
peanut butter and jelly.
Soon after the students en
tered Ashe House, UM President
Henry Stanford summoned
police. After several hours of un
successful negotiating, 30 stu
dents, including Student Body
President Susan Havey, were ar
rested.
According to Alan Mar'cus,
editor-in-chief of the campus
newspaper, the students were

protesting a tuition hike of $200
for the 1977-78 academic year,
which was the fifth increase im
posed by the UM Board of Trus
tees during the last six years.
In all, the tuition at UM has
escalated by $1200 since 1970-
71, resulting in the current an
nual fee of $3500 for under
graduates enrolled at the "pri
vate, international, independent
university," as the official let
terhead reads.
Marcus said the turnout was
"earth-shattering for UM" and
explained that the student's
principal demand was that the
Board of Trustees and president
set up a meeting with student
representatives to discuss the
tuition jump and justify its
necessity by producing the
school's itemized budget charts.
During the week of April 11,
Havey and other members of the
student government asked Stan
ford to meet with them at the
president's office so that the
trustees could present the
budget and specify why it was
necessary for the university to
increase tuition once again, said
Marcus.
Stanford felt nothing would
come of such a meeting, saying
that he'd "already made broad
budgetary material available,"
hut offered to speak with the
student leaders at the campus
cafeteria April 15.
Disagreeing, Havey and about
23 others, Marcus reported,
staged a sit-in for more than six
hours at Stanford's office in
Ashe House while the president

waited, symbolically, at the
cafeteria for two hours.
Negotiations stopped entirely
and nothing more was ac
complished, said Marcus, until
the mass demonstration and
siege of Ashe.
Although the demonstration
was peaceful, Marcus said Stan
ford called police on campus.
Nine squad cars and one paddy
wagon arrived with about 20 of
ficers. A spokesman for the Coral
Gables police said some 60 city
policemen and 12 county riot
squad officers were also availa
ble and on standby.
Many of the students in the
building left quietly when told
they would be arrested. How
ever, Havey, released on $500
bond, says about 120 stayed.
Havey was first to be arrested.
A reporter on the scene quoted
her as saying: "I believe the stu
dent body here. 1 can't believe
the administration chose not to
meet with us. 1 love everyone
here because they had the cour
age to stand up for what they be
lieved."
Although a dramatic show,
Marcus explained, "Except for
the students getting busted, no
thing's happened. The president
says he'll meet with them but be
lieves there was 'no merit to the
protest,' and still hasn't agreed
to allow student review of the
budget."
In a related incident, more
than 2500 students of New
York's state and city university
systems' marched into New
York's capital city March 20, to

protest Governor John Carey's
proposed budget which cuts full
"funding of the state Tuition As
sistance Program that many stu
dents, unable to win scholar
ships or produce enough money
