Dear Duca,
I would like to know why Stanford supplies the
house associates (RAs) with the grades of all the
students in their dorms every quarter. I am
shocked that such a policy is allowed (Certainly,
the RAs in my dorm have no qualifications which
should privilege them to see my scores).
I am outraged. I believe that most students
would agree that their right to privacy has been
trampled, if only they knew of this outrageous
policy.
Is this policy legal? How can we protect our
privacy?
Melanie
Dear Melanie,
It is not the RAs, but the resident fellows whoare
entrusted with the students' grades, because: 1)
They are responsible for the academic problems of
those residing in the dorm; or 2) for possible so
called mechanical errors.
Discretion is one of the qualifications of the resi
dent fellow's job, and it is only very special cases
they are referring to their colleagues.
Of course, 1 quite agree with you that students
are entitled to their privacy, exceptional cases only
confirming this rule. Should you still feel "out
raged," please come to see me.

Dear Duca,
I am an attractive, 29-year-old virgin. In youi
opinion should I be proud or mortified'. 1 ' I have
never been tempted-indeed I suspect lam missing
a hormone-lwt even were I now, I've decided I've
something of a record and just for the novelty of it
should hold out for the fireworks on my wedding
night, presuming / have one. On the other hand it
would seem most everyone else is getting in a lot of
practice and I'm a little worried my honeymoon
could be a bust for my inexperience.
A senior
Dear Senior.
No, you shouldn't feel "proud" nor "mortified"
nor "missing a hormone" for still being a virgin at
29, because, first, you are true to yourself, and,
second, because The Day Will Dawn or The Night
Will Fall, when you will at last be able to abandon
yourself completely and unconditionally.
As for fearing a lack of practice, believe me,
human nature being what it is, you will catch up
very soon with a little help from your partner's
adult experience, no doubt.
So perk up, ecstasy will be even greater for hav
ing known how to wait intelligently, though, of
course, impatiently,
DUCA
