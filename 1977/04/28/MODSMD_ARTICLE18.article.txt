# Electric bike, trike industry booming
## 
### 
Chicago (AP) â€” An inventor
and manufacturer of electric
bikes and trik.es says 10 million
of the vehicles may be on Ameri
can streets in the years ahead as
an alternative to gasoline-fueled
transport.
Joe O'Neill, who rigged his
first electric motor to a bike
when he was 12, holds a patent
on an electric power pack that
can be installed on any bicycle.
He's assistant to the president of
a New Jersey firm that markets
its own electric bicycles and
tricycles.
He predicted that within five
years, the young electric bike in
dustry will have about 10 per
cent of the bicycle market as
people search for energy-saving
methods of close-in transporta
tion.

O'Neill is among 100
exhibitors at the Electric Vehicle
Expo here, which features
exhibits ranging from a battery
powered ambulance to a city
bus.
Others
The exhibits include two other
electric bike manufacturers,
Palmer Industries of Endicott,
N.Y., and Lyman Metal Products
Corp., of Norwalk, Conn.
Public interest in the show has
proven so great that sponsors
had to change the telephone
number of the press room Tues
day because of the large number
of calls from people wanting in
formation.
"I built my first electric bicycle
in 1939 with a six-volt starting
motor and battery," O'Neill said.
"I kept it on a week and was very

unhappy with it. It was all too
heavy. When the gas crunch
came along in 1974 1 dug that old
idea out and as far as electric
bikes are concerned, we're No. 1
in the world."
O'Neill said his company has
since sold about 15,000 units,
including the power packs,
bicycles and tricycles.
"Elderly citizens really go for
our tricycles," he said in an in
terview. "Our three-wheel groc
ery getter goes eight to 10 miles
per hour...This is the big number
with senior citizens and we get
some very lovely letters from
these people."
No license required
O'Neill said his firm, General
Engines Co., has sold about 2000
tricycles. In 25 states, he said, no
drivers license or helmet is re

quired. The motorized tricycle
costs about $395.
O'Neill's Electroped is a con
ventional bicycle equipped with
an electrical drive unit on the
front wheel.
"When 1 developed this, 1
didn't want to destroy the bicy
cle itself, so to speak," O'Neill
said. "You can release a handle
on the device which disengages
the drive motor from the bicycle
and the bicycle is still a bicycle."
The bicycle rides about 20
miles without needing a re
charge and costs about $295.
The power pack alone sel Is for
$160and weighs2B pounds. Top
speed without pedaling is 15
miles per hour. Pedaling with
the unit engaged allows a top
speed of 25 miles per hour,
O'Neill said.
