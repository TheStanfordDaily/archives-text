# Some Sierra rivers to run dry

### 
Sacramento (AP) —Many
northern California rivers that
flow out of the Sierras will run
dry this summer for the first time
since 1931, the U.S. weather
bureau predicted yesterday.
So will the Truckee and Car
son that flow east toward
Nevada, said Robert Burnash,
head of the bureau's
California-Nevada River Fore
cast Center.
The difference is that reser
voirs, which didn't exist in 1931,
will keep water in the lower
reaches of most streams, Bur
nash said. The headwaters,
above the reservoirs, will be as
dry as they were in 1931.

Burnash predicted the
Cosumnes will go dry above
Michigan Bar in May, followed
by the Tule in June, barring un
likely heavy thunderstorms.
His forecast says the
Mokelumne and Carson will
nearly disappear in July.
In August, he predicted
there'll be only a trickle in the
headwaters of the Truckee, the
middle and south forks of the
American, the Bear, Merced,
Tuolumne and Stanislaus.
"A primary factor in determin
ing which streams will be com
pletely dry will be the tempera
tures during the summer
months," he said.

"A few streams having ex
tremely small flows during cool
periods may disappear during
periods of hot weather."
On the coast, the Eel, Russian,
Napa and Noyo are expected to
be dry or nearly dry except
where there are reservoirs.
Small flows are expected to
continue on the Smith, Klamath,
Trinity, Mad and Mattole Rivers
and Redwood Creek on the north
coast.
Some of the coastal streams
went nearly dry in recent years,
Burnash said. He said there was
only a trickle in the Noyo in 196H
and in the Mad in 1970 and in
the North Fork of the Eel in 1959.
