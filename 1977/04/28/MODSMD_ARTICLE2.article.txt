# Marine protesters won't be charged

The Palo Alto District Attorney's of
fice announced yesterday that no
charges will be filed against any de
monstrators in the anti-marine rally
April 13.
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Fahrenholz
cited conflicting evidence and prob
lems with identifying the protestors as
the reasons for dropping the case.
"The major discrepancy in evi
dence," Fahrenholz said, "is what
exactly was said before the physical
conflict occurred. That was the main
thing that troubled me.
"On top of that," he added, "who to
prosecute and for what, and how
exactly to identify everyone were all
problems."
Rear entrance
At the April 13 demonstration,
about 25 protesters blocked the rear
entrance to the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
Marine recruiter Paul Kroeger, who
had an appointment to meet a student
inside the CPPC, was escorted through
the barricade by Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington and several other
public safety officers.
"No one was badly injured," Her
rington said. "There were a couple of
things that were done to me intention
ally that I took exception to, but it was
done in the heat of the moment."
However, the final decision and re
sponsibility was with the District At
torney (DA), Herrington said.
'Means nothing'
Clarifying his position on campus,
Herrington said, "In relation to the
University, 1 am a law enforcement of
ficer. A student standing as a student
means nothing to me as such. I view
everything in terms of people's
rights."
On the protesters' side, relief was
evident.
"Glad to hear it," said Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC) member Mike
Jennings.
Protester's group spokesman Chris
Coleman said he was also relieved by
the decision.
'Our lawyer'
"The DA talked to our lawyer and
asked us for a statement," Coleman

said. "It gave our side of the case. I
guess it was good enough to end this
whole thing."
This decision effectively puts the
whole issue to rest, since the Univer
sity already decided at a meeting on
April 21 not to take any action. The
students, who at one time were con
sidering their own legal action, are
also willing to let the matter lie.
"We have no plans for legal action
against Herrington," Coleman said.
