## Film/howard baldwin Meaders: 'a very strong antipathy to civilized life' 
### 
You are alone. Isolated. Not just behind-closed
doors-alone-isolated. You are 50 miles from your
nearest neighbor. Eighty-five above the Arctic
Circle. Far, far away from everything — books . . .
bottles . . . McDonald's. What do you miss the
most?
Fred and Elaine Meader, filmmakers of Year of
the Caribou, feeling "a very strong antipathy to
civilized life," as characterized in the Eisenhower
decade by bourgeois, complacent, living on
wall-to-wall carpeting, left the United States.
Searching for something as far away from the
"Coca-Cola culture" as possible, they toured
Europe, Mexico and Canada as vagabonds: camp
ing, mountain-climbing and writing.
Why did they take off? Fred simply did not want
to conform. He wanted to retain his individuality
at all costs, yet all his alternatives were acutely

'We had the freedom and
time to live the way we
wanted."

unpromising. He says, "In order to think diffe
rently, we had to live differently — without a de
fensive, reactive, negative posture against culture.
I had to maintain my own sense of what life was
about."
In British Columbia, they built a log cabin. "We
felt right at home. We didn't need things. We had
the freedom and time to live the way we wanted,"
says Fred. Elaine, on the other hand, found what
she calls problematic difficulties in rejecting an
entire culture. She felt an intense psychological
isolation. Eventually, though, through adaption,
through the isolation, she found roots in the wil
derness.
Eventually their search led them to that isolated
spot above the Arctic Circle, to an abandoned
prospector's cabin on ? lake, as far away from de
velopment as possible, but close enough to the tree
line to provide them with wood. They stayed for 15
years, with only a few trips back to civilization.
What did they miss? As Elaine says, "1 missed
the exhileration of social interaction." She notes
that isolation is, after all, unnatural, and that there
is a perceptible sense of vitality with a group of

people in a room.
But Fred adds that they never missed tangible
things. They missed music, a primal need, enough
to purchase a battery-operated record player.
Other than that, Fred said, "We don't miss things

"There's a sense of con
tinuity, a sense of relation
ship to the world."

— "titillation objects,' I call them. We're happy
with a simple diet."
But, more important in determining the key to
the Meader's happiness in the wilderness is what
they missed during their returns to civilization.
Elaine says she misses "the ability to relate to ev
erything. Life there is calmer and less fragmented.
There's a sense of continuity, a sense of relation
ship to the world. You are aware of the sunrise and
the sunset. You can begin a thought in the morning
and it's not broken by phone calls."
The film, showing here Saturday night with Fred
and Elaine answering questions afterwards, shows
their primitive yet comfortable existence in the
Alaskan wilderness. The title refers to the caribou
deer who migrate through their valley annually,
who are the Meader's chief source of nourishment
and staple items.
The idea for the film originally cameabout when
Fred, needing money for medical expenses, be
came a hunter's guide, and then progressed to
filming the hunter's expeditions. Then, he "fell in
love with the concept of movement," and felt that
he had to share his perception of the world with
the civilized world. Somehow, he had to translate
his experience to this culture, for he felt the need
for communication. Film fulfilled that need.
And although he calls films and filmmaking ter
ribly draining, and denies the desire to make any
more, he feels very strongly about Year of the
Caribou, with good reason. It is a film of beautiful
scenery and a strangely alluring lifestyle. The
Meader's Alaska is a place we would all like to
escape to sometimes.
(Year of the Caribou will be shown in Memorial
Auditorium Saturday night at 8:30 p.m.)

You are alone. Isolated. Not just behind-closed
doors-alone-isolated. You are 50 miles from your
nearest neighbor. Eighty-five above the Arctic
Circle. Far, far away from everything — books . . .
bottles . . . McDonald's. What do you miss the
most?
Fred and Elaine Meader, filmmakers of Year of
the Caribou, feeling "a very strong antipathy to
civilized life," as characterized in the Eisenhower
decade by bourgeois, complacent, living on
wall-to-wall carpeting, left the United States.
Searching for something as far away from the
"Coca-Cola culture" as possible, they toured
Europe, Mexico and Canada as vagabonds: camp
ing, mountain-climbing and writing.
Why did they take off? Fred simply did not want
to conform. He wanted to retain his individuality
at all costs, yet all his alternatives were acutely

'We had the freedom and
time to live the way we
wanted."

unpromising. He says, "In order to think diffe
rently, we had to live differently — without a de
fensive, reactive, negative posture against culture.
I had to maintain my own sense of what life was
about."
In British Columbia, they built a log cabin. "We
felt right at home. We didn't need things. We had
the freedom and time to live the way we wanted,"
says Fred. Elaine, on the other hand, found what
she calls problematic difficulties in rejecting an
entire culture. She felt an intense psychological
isolation. Eventually, though, through adaption,
through the isolation, she found roots in the wil
derness.
Eventually their search led them to that isolated
spot above the Arctic Circle, to an abandoned
prospector's cabin on ? lake, as far away from de
velopment as possible, but close enough to the tree
line to provide them with wood. They stayed for 15
years, with only a few trips back to civilization.
What did they miss? As Elaine says, "1 missed
the exhileration of social interaction." She notes
that isolation is, after all, unnatural, and that there
is a perceptible sense of vitality with a group of

people in a room.
But Fred adds that they never missed tangible
things. They missed music, a primal need, enough
to purchase a battery-operated record player.
Other than that, Fred said, "We don't miss things

"There's a sense of con
tinuity, a sense of relation
ship to the world."

— "titillation objects,' I call them. We're happy
with a simple diet."
But, more important in determining the key to
the Meader's happiness in the wilderness is what
they missed during their returns to civilization.
Elaine says she misses "the ability to relate to ev
erything. Life there is calmer and less fragmented.
There's a sense of continuity, a sense of relation
ship to the world. You are aware of the sunrise and
the sunset. You can begin a thought in the morning
and it's not broken by phone calls."
The film, showing here Saturday night with Fred
and Elaine answering questions afterwards, shows
their primitive yet comfortable existence in the
Alaskan wilderness. The title refers to the caribou
deer who migrate through their valley annually,
who are the Meader's chief source of nourishment
and staple items.
The idea for the film originally cameabout when
Fred, needing money for medical expenses, be
came a hunter's guide, and then progressed to
filming the hunter's expeditions. Then, he "fell in
love with the concept of movement," and felt that
he had to share his perception of the world with
the civilized world. Somehow, he had to translate
his experience to this culture, for he felt the need
for communication. Film fulfilled that need.
And although he calls films and filmmaking ter
ribly draining, and denies the desire to make any
more, he feels very strongly about Year of the
Caribou, with good reason. It is a film of beautiful
scenery and a strangely alluring lifestyle. The
Meader's Alaska is a place we would all like to
escape to sometimes.
