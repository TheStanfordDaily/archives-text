## Come one, Kamal, at Flint Center 
### 
Anyone who has not been to
DeAnza College's Flint Center is
either lazy or a philistine. A
painless 20 minute drive away,
Flint is as attractive an au
ditorium as any in the Bay Area
and in fact does attract the very
best names in the performing
arts.
A case in point is Flint's guitar
series which featured Andres
Segovia and Carlos Montoya,
among others, and which ended
last Sunday with the young clas
sical guitarist Turan-Mirza
Kamal.
Great hopes
At 24 years of age, Kamal
clearly belongs to the new gen
eration of classical guitarists, the
first modern one which does not
have to contend with wide
spread indifference to (or depre
cation of) its instrument or its
repertoire. It also has available
the tutorship of a number of vir
tuosos of the highest order.
Kamal has taken full advantage
of this resource, having studied
under Segovia, Emilio Pujol, Ju
lian Bream and John Williams.
It is not surprising, then, that
great hopes are pinned on the
young Tatar; the question latent
in the reviews of his perfor
mances is, as explicitly put in
the Honolulu Sunday Adver
tiser, "Is Kamal the next
Segovia?"
It seemed Sunday that Kamal
was setting out to answer that
question in the affirmative. The
composers on the program were
varied in age and origin, (from
the Englishman John Dowland
of the sixteenth century to the
Mexican Agustin Barrios of the
twentieth century) but the pieces
were uniformly difficult.
Strategy
As Kamal unfolded the first
two selections, "Mounsiers Al
maine" by the Elizabethan
Daniell Batchelar and Fernando
Sor's "Largo non T ,nto," his
strategy became apparent. With

the former's flashy runs of six
teenth notes, impressive but not
taxing for a pre-eminent
guitarist, and the manifold op
portunities for affecting melodic
and rhythmic interpretation in
the slower strains of the latter,
Kamal could win the audience
over and then gather his strength
during the "modern" "Theme,
Varie et Finale" (by Manuel
Ponce, a piece long a favorite of
Segovia) for the supreme test.
Bach's "Praeludium" from the
"Fourth Lute Suite." With his
brilliance thus unequivocally es
tablished, he could frolic
through de la Maza's pair of An
dalusian dances, "Petenera"
and "Zapateudo," before the in
termission and afterward devote
himself to the more innovative
second half of the program.
Unfortunately, things started
to go awry for Kamal almost im
mediately. The difference bet
ween perfection of tone and gen
eral disaster can be as little as a
tenth of an inch with the guitar,
and if the player himself is even
slightly out of adjustment he can
expect the problem to be appa
rent in his playing. By all out
ward indications, Kamal's left
hand was in some manner ailing.
He navigated through the runs
of "Mounsiers" admirably but
was inclined toward fuzziness in
the chordal passages. At one
point he almost lost his com
mand of the piece altogether but
made a quick recovery. He
seemed better during "Largo
non Tanto," but he relapsed into
severe fuzziness and buzzing
during the third piece.
Formidable pieces
Bach transcriptions for guitar
are almost without exception
pieces for an accomplished mas
ter. Their complexity and tech
nical difficulty are such that
only after many years of experi
ence with a particular piece can
the guitarist hope to gain true
command of it. Kamal was obvi

ously not in command ot any
thing at the threshold of
"Praeludium" but he made a
brave attempt, not even losing
confidence after a false start. But
the inevitable was to occur:
midway through the second
movement he faltered, made a
partial recovery, and faltered
again, finally coming to a com
plete standstill. After an agoniz
ing pause, he mumbled an apol
ogy and limped through the final
movement. So even in top form
he may not yet be a Segovia, but
he did prove himself a true pro
fessional by following his fail ure
with creditable versions of de la
Maza's dances.
He made several substitutions
and rearrangements in the sec

ond half in an attempt to give the
audience their due and by and
large played six entertaining
pieces. Any doubt as to his re
silience was banished by a
breath-taking performance of
Barrios' "Le Catedral." A pair of
self-composed pieces from a
suite originally for orchestra
were each very impressive. Con
cluding with Albeniz' "Sevilla,"
Kamal earned the warm
applause which he received.
Guitar aff iciandos of another age
or country might not have been
so forgiving, demanding im
mediate fulfillment of any
claims to greatness, but the au
dience at Flint apparently
elected to reserve judgment for
the future.

ditorium as any in the Bay Area
and in fact does attract the very
best names in the performing
arts.
A case in point is Flint's guitar
series which featured Andres
Segovia and Carlos Montoya,
among others, and which ended
last Sunday with the young clas
sical guitarist Turan-Mirza
Kamal.
Great hopes
At 24 years of age, Kamal
clearly belongs to the new gen
eration of classical guitarists, the
first modern one which does not
have to contend with wide
spread indifference to (or depre
cation of) its instrument or its
repertoire. It also has available
the tutorship of a number of vir
tuosos of the highest order.
Kamal has taken full advantage
of this resource, having studied
under Segovia, Emilio Pujol, Ju
lian Bream and John Williams.
It is not surprising, then, that
great hopes are pinned on the
young Tatar; the question latent
in the reviews of his perfor
mances is, as explicitly put in
the Honolulu Sunday Adver
tiser, "Is Kamal the next
Segovia?"
It seemed Sunday that Kamal
was setting out to answer that
question in the affirmative. The
composers on the program were
varied in age and origin, (from
the Englishman John Dowland
of the sixteenth century to the
Mexican Agustin Barrios of the
twentieth century) but the pieces
were uniformly difficult.
Strategy
As Kamal unfolded the first
two selections, "Mounsiers Al
maine" by the Elizabethan
Daniell Batchelar and Fernando
Sor's "Largo non T ,nto," his
strategy became apparent. With

the former's flashy runs of six
teenth notes, impressive but not
taxing for a pre-eminent
guitarist, and the manifold op
portunities for affecting melodic
and rhythmic interpretation in
the slower strains of the latter,
Kamal could win the audience
over and then gather his strength
during the "modern" "Theme,
Varie et Finale" (by Manuel
Ponce, a piece long a favorite of
Segovia) for the supreme test.
Bach's "Praeludium" from the
"Fourth Lute Suite." With his
brilliance thus unequivocally es
tablished, he could frolic
through de la Maza's pair of An
dalusian dances, "Petenera"
and "Zapateudo," before the in
termission and afterward devote
himself to the more innovative
second half of the program.
Unfortunately, things started
to go awry for Kamal almost im
mediately. The difference bet
ween perfection of tone and gen
eral disaster can be as little as a
tenth of an inch with the guitar,
and if the player himself is even
slightly out of adjustment he can
expect the problem to be appa
rent in his playing. By all out
ward indications, Kamal's left
hand was in some manner ailing.
He navigated through the runs
of "Mounsiers" admirably but
was inclined toward fuzziness in
the chordal passages. At one
point he almost lost his com
mand of the piece altogether but
made a quick recovery. He
seemed better during "Largo
non Tanto," but he relapsed into
severe fuzziness and buzzing
during the third piece.
Formidable pieces
Bach transcriptions for guitar
are almost without exception
pieces for an accomplished mas
ter. Their complexity and tech
nical difficulty are such that
only after many years of experi
ence with a particular piece can
the guitarist hope to gain true
command of it. Kamal was obvi

ously not in command ot any
thing at the threshold of
"Praeludium" but he made a
brave attempt, not even losing
confidence after a false start. But
the inevitable was to occur:
midway through the second
movement he faltered, made a
partial recovery, and faltered
again, finally coming to a com
plete standstill. After an agoniz
ing pause, he mumbled an apol
ogy and limped through the final
movement. So even in top form
he may not yet be a Segovia, but
he did prove himself a true pro
fessional by following his fail ure
with creditable versions of de la
Maza's dances.
He made several substitutions
and rearrangements in the sec

ond half in an attempt to give the
audience their due and by and
large played six entertaining
pieces. Any doubt as to his re
silience was banished by a
breath-taking performance of
Barrios' "Le Catedral." A pair of
self-composed pieces from a
suite originally for orchestra
were each very impressive. Con
cluding with Albeniz' "Sevilla,"
Kamal earned the warm
applause which he received.
Guitar aff iciandos of another age
or country might not have been
so forgiving, demanding im
mediate fulfillment of any
claims to greatness, but the au
dience at Flint apparently
elected to reserve judgment for
the future.

among others, and which ended
last Sunday with the young clas
sical guitarist Turan-Mirza
Kamal.
Great hopes
At 24 years of age, Kamal
clearly belongs to the new gen
eration of classical guitarists, the
first modern one which does not
have to contend with wide
spread indifference to (or depre
cation of) its instrument or its
repertoire. It also has available
the tutorship of a number of vir
tuosos of the highest order.
Kamal has taken full advantage
of this resource, having studied
under Segovia, Emilio Pujol, Ju
lian Bream and John Williams.
It is not surprising, then, that
great hopes are pinned on the
young Tatar; the question latent
in the reviews of his perfor
mances is, as explicitly put in
the Honolulu Sunday Adver
tiser, "Is Kamal the next
Segovia?"
It seemed Sunday that Kamal
was setting out to answer that
question in the affirmative. The
composers on the program were
varied in age and origin, (from
the Englishman John Dowland
of the sixteenth century to the
Mexican Agustin Barrios of the
twentieth century) but the pieces
were uniformly difficult.
Strategy
As Kamal unfolded the first
two selections, "Mounsiers Al
maine" by the Elizabethan
Daniell Batchelar and Fernando
Sor's "Largo non T ,nto," his
strategy became apparent. With

the former's flashy runs of six
teenth notes, impressive but not
taxing for a pre-eminent
guitarist, and the manifold op
portunities for affecting melodic
and rhythmic interpretation in
the slower strains of the latter,
Kamal could win the audience
over and then gather his strength
during the "modern" "Theme,
Varie et Finale" (by Manuel
Ponce, a piece long a favorite of
Segovia) for the supreme test.
Bach's "Praeludium" from the
"Fourth Lute Suite." With his
brilliance thus unequivocally es
tablished, he could frolic
through de la Maza's pair of An
dalusian dances, "Petenera"
and "Zapateudo," before the in
termission and afterward devote
himself to the more innovative
second half of the program.
Unfortunately, things started
to go awry for Kamal almost im
mediately. The difference bet
ween perfection of tone and gen
eral disaster can be as little as a
tenth of an inch with the guitar,
and if the player himself is even
slightly out of adjustment he can
expect the problem to be appa
rent in his playing. By all out
ward indications, Kamal's left
hand was in some manner ailing.
He navigated through the runs
of "Mounsiers" admirably but
was inclined toward fuzziness in
the chordal passages. At one
point he almost lost his com
mand of the piece altogether but
made a quick recovery. He
seemed better during "Largo
non Tanto," but he relapsed into
severe fuzziness and buzzing
during the third piece.
Formidable pieces
Bach transcriptions for guitar
are almost without exception
pieces for an accomplished mas
ter. Their complexity and tech
nical difficulty are such that
only after many years of experi
ence with a particular piece can
the guitarist hope to gain true
command of it. Kamal was obvi

ously not in command ot any
thing at the threshold of
"Praeludium" but he made a
brave attempt, not even losing
confidence after a false start. But
the inevitable was to occur:
midway through the second
movement he faltered, made a
partial recovery, and faltered
again, finally coming to a com
plete standstill. After an agoniz
ing pause, he mumbled an apol
ogy and limped through the final
movement. So even in top form
he may not yet be a Segovia, but
he did prove himself a true pro
fessional by following his fail ure
with creditable versions of de la
Maza's dances.
He made several substitutions
and rearrangements in the sec

ond half in an attempt to give the
audience their due and by and
large played six entertaining
pieces. Any doubt as to his re
silience was banished by a
breath-taking performance of
Barrios' "Le Catedral." A pair of
self-composed pieces from a
suite originally for orchestra
were each very impressive. Con
cluding with Albeniz' "Sevilla,"
Kamal earned the warm
applause which he received.
Guitar aff iciandos of another age
or country might not have been
so forgiving, demanding im
mediate fulfillment of any
claims to greatness, but the au
dience at Flint apparently
elected to reserve judgment for
the future.
