## MJQ's cool jazz has crowd on its feet 
### 
Bizarre costumes, colored
strobe lights, walls of amplifiers,
and the pleasant smell of stale
tobacco and cheap grass create
the energy that punctuates the
pop music scene.
None of this was in evidence
Monday night at Oakland's
Paramount Theatre, when four
men in black suits, white shirts,
and black bowties, walked on
stage to four acoustic instru
ments, and played a program of
cool jazz that had the audience
on their feet before the final
chord progression was resolved.
It was the Modern Jazz Quartet,
touring the country on their 25th
anniversary.
The group didn't play a gi«,
they performed a concert. There
was a printed program, the
pieces were arranged and exe
cuted with accuracy, with only
the solos "open," and the mem
bers didn't say a single word to
the audience or to each other.
The spontaneity was controlled
and the atmosphere dignified.

The result of this style, which
probably sounds like imprison
ment to many jazz musicians, is
that the attention and energy
comes almost completely from
the music. Thus, when the "hot"
solo happens, the audience and
players react with exuberance.
The sound of the MJQ is clear
and precise. This is because it is
made up of four rhythm instru
ments, three of them percussion:
piano (John Lewis), vibes (Milt
Jackson), bass (Percy Heath) and
drums and percussion (Connie
Kay).
There is no spit, valve oil, in
tonation or tuning to cloud the
rhythms or notes. Each cymbal
beat is audible. Each note of a
long vibes run is distinct.
The emphasis of the MJQ is on
arrangements. Many of the tunes
began with a classical interplay
of vibes and piano and then fell
into swing. Lewis bases his
compositions on Debussy-style
lyricism.
Jackson's pieces were mostly

medium-tempo blues. They also
played pieces by Charlie Parker,
Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonius
Monk.
I was disappointed to note in
the program that they were
going to play Cershwin's "Sum
mertime." Every jazz band plays
an arrangement of "Summer
time" and 1 couldn't conceive of
the MJQ presenting an original
version of the classic. They did.
It began with the piano and
vibes exchanging the melody
with a steady ascending riff
while the bass was picking out
the roots of the chords in the
upper range. Most musical peaks
come at high volume. The MJQ
climaxes a piece at the quietest
point.
"Summertime" reached such
a low volume that Jackson was
barely grazing the keys. The
group proved the paradox that
"less is more."
The second to last piece was a
John Lewis arrangement of the
Adagio movement from "Con

cierto de Aranjuez," a guitar
concerto by Joaquin Rodrigo.
Mostly written out, the piece
jumped from soft passages of
Lewis' chords embellished with
Jackson's Spanish vibes riffs, to
fast salsa-latin rhythms, em
phasized with an array of per
cussion toys played by Connie
Kay, and to swing sections with
short solos. One great theme was
built on another.
Lewis' solos are sparse like
Basie, but much more tonal.
Lewis always strived for
simplicity, partly because he
wanted jazz to have a wider ap
peal.
"The audience for jazz can be
widened if we strengthen our
work with structure. If there is
more of a reason for what's going
on, there'll be more overall
sense, and therefore, more in
terest for the listener.
"I do not think, however, that
the sections in this 'structured
jazz' — both the improvised and
written sections — should take

on too much complexity. The
total effect must be within the
mind's ability to appreciate
through the ear."
Jackson plays smoothly, run
ning up and down the vibes with
great speed and deftness. When
he finishes a solo, he takes a few
steps back, puts his hands down,
and rolls his eyes like Ed Sulli
van.
Bassist Percy Heath wasn't
featured until the second encore
when he played a melodic,
bluesy, extended solo. He
should have had more solos; yet
he seemed quite surprised when
Lewis stopped playing and nod
ded to him the first time.
The MJQ temporarily dis
banded in 1974. This is their first
tour since, which accounts for
the standing ovation they re
ceived before they began to play.
It was their playing, however,
which has been described as
sounding like "loose change,"
that caused the three standing
ovations after the finale and two
encores.

through the ear."
Jackson plays smoothly, run
ning up and down the vibes with
great speed and deftness. When
he finishes a solo, he takes a few
steps back, puts his hands down,
and rolls his eyes like Ed Sulli
van.
Bassist Percy Heath wasn't
featured until the second encore
when he played a melodic,
bluesy, extended solo. He
should have had more solos; yet
he seemed quite surprised when
Lewis stopped playing and nod
ded to him the first time.
The MJQ temporarily dis
banded in 1974. This is their first
tour since, which accounts for
the standing ovation they re
ceived before they began to play.
It was their playing, however,
which has been described as
sounding like "loose change,"
that caused the three standing
ovations after the finale and two
encores.
Bizarre costumes, colored
strobe lights, walls of amplifiers,
and the pleasant smell of stale
tobacco and cheap grass create
the energy that punctuates the
pop music scene.
None of this was in evidence
Monday night at Oakland's
Paramount Theatre, when four
men in black suits, white shirts,
and black bowties, walked on
stage to four acoustic instru
ments, and played a program of
cool jazz that had the audience
on their feet before the final
chord progression was resolved.
It was the Modern Jazz Quartet,
touring the country on their 25th
anniversary.
The group didn't play a gi«,
they performed a concert. There
was a printed program, the
pieces were arranged and exe
cuted with accuracy, with only
the solos "open," and the mem
bers didn't say a single word to
the audience or to each other.
The spontaneity was controlled
and the atmosphere dignified.

The result of this style, which
probably sounds like imprison
ment to many jazz musicians, is
that the attention and energy
comes almost completely from
the music. Thus, when the "hot"
solo happens, the audience and
players react with exuberance.
The sound of the MJQ is clear
and precise. This is because it is
made up of four rhythm instru
ments, three of them percussion:
piano (John Lewis), vibes (Milt
Jackson), bass (Percy Heath) and
drums and percussion (Connie
Kay).
There is no spit, valve oil, in
tonation or tuning to cloud the
rhythms or notes. Each cymbal
beat is audible. Each note of a
long vibes run is distinct.
The emphasis of the MJQ is on
arrangements. Many of the tunes
began with a classical interplay
of vibes and piano and then fell
into swing. Lewis bases his
compositions on Debussy-style
lyricism.
Jackson's pieces were mostly

medium-tempo blues. They also
played pieces by Charlie Parker,
Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonius
Monk.
I was disappointed to note in
the program that they were
going to play Cershwin's "Sum
mertime." Every jazz band plays
an arrangement of "Summer
time" and 1 couldn't conceive of
the MJQ presenting an original
version of the classic. They did.
It began with the piano and
vibes exchanging the melody
with a steady ascending riff
while the bass was picking out
the roots of the chords in the
upper range. Most musical peaks
come at high volume. The MJQ
climaxes a piece at the quietest
point.
"Summertime" reached such
a low volume that Jackson was
barely grazing the keys. The
group proved the paradox that
"less is more."
The second to last piece was a
John Lewis arrangement of the
Adagio movement from "Con

cierto de Aranjuez," a guitar
concerto by Joaquin Rodrigo.
Mostly written out, the piece
jumped from soft passages of
Lewis' chords embellished with
Jackson's Spanish vibes riffs, to
fast salsa-latin rhythms, em
phasized with an array of per
cussion toys played by Connie
Kay, and to swing sections with
short solos. One great theme was
built on another.
Lewis' solos are sparse like
Basie, but much more tonal.
Lewis always strived for
simplicity, partly because he
wanted jazz to have a wider ap
peal.
"The audience for jazz can be
widened if we strengthen our
work with structure. If there is
more of a reason for what's going
on, there'll be more overall
sense, and therefore, more in
terest for the listener.
