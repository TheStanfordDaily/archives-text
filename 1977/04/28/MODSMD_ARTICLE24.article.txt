and Katherine Hepburn in
their second MGM collabora
tion, a spoof rich in winning
theatrics. Directing the story
of a husband and wife facing
off as prosecutor and defense

and quickly drops, the issue
of equality between the sexes.

Cool Hand Luke Paul
Newman in one of the
stronger misfit-as-hero films
of the '60s. The title role was
tailored to Newman's fit by
Donn Pearce and Frank Pier
son and hence he walks
through the picture in
macho splendor. Watch for
the youthful Dennis Hopper
as one of the prisoners. Satur
day evening at 7 and 9:30 in
Bishop. Admission $1 (Radi

cal Film Series).
Next Stop, Greenwich Vil
lage Shelley Winters (be
lieve it or not) sparkles in
Mazursky's satire of the "Vil
lage" scene of the '50s. The
pace alternates between
being completely frenetic and
the beatnik's equivalent of
"laid-back." Saturday even
ing at 8 and 10 in Kresge.
Admission $1 (Law School
Film Society).
The Story of Adele H. Truf
faut has embarked on a per
sonal renaissance after his
series of competent but con
ventional films of the late '60s
and early '70s. Day for Night
was his declaration of inde
pendence from those films;
Adele H. is a masterpiece of
artistic intelligence and pas
sion. Isabelle Adjani is in the
title role as Victor Hugo's
daughter. Sunday evening at

7 and 9:15 in Memorial. Ad
mission $.50 (Sunday Flicks).
Banditi a Or
gosolo Documentary
film-maker DeSeta combined
fiction and elements from his
own medium to produce one
of the earliest (1961) films in
the style which came to be
known as cinema verite. His
torically and cinematically
fascinating, but a little
punishing in its earnestness.
Tuesday evening at 8 in
Kresge. Admission $1.25 (Ita
lian Film Series).
Kuhle Wampe Brecht's
most noted essay in the
medium of film is a rejection
of virtually every aspect of
German cinema â€” including
such a non-exclusively Ger
man device as the plot. 1932
was a year of political tension
in Germany and the already

politically-oriented Brecht
was inspired to make this film
a purely political creation, at
the expense of everything
else in it. Dudow directed.
Wednesday evening at 7:30 in
Kresge. Admission $.50
(German Film Series).
Playtime Tati's hugely en
tertaining urban-Parisian
visual comedy gently bewails
the passing of the old
fashioned substance (in the
literal sense) of the city. Tati's
protagonist, M. Hulot,
watches as all types of
ephemera are perpetrated on
a group of tourists: the plate
glass door so spotless and
well-oiled that it is impossi
ble to determine whether the
doorman actually opens it or
mimes the action. Wednes
day evening at 7:30 and 9:30
in Bishop. Admission $1.25
(French Film Series).
