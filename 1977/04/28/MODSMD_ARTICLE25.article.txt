## Country isn't make believe 
### 
Luxury Liner
Emmylou Harris
Warner Bros.
"Making believe that you still love
me, It's leaving me alone and so
blue."
The listener is making believe
that Emmylou Harris is not a
New York-bred folksinger from

the Greenwich Village club cir
cuit, and making believe that she
has ridden the trains she sings
of, and seen the river deltas she
describes.
Yet, her voice is so convinc
ingly sweet. The fiddles and
guitars which accompany her
have that genuine country
twang. Einmylou makes us be
lieve.
Luxury Liner, her most recent
release, is full-fledged country
music. It is a lot closer to the real
thing than the songs ofher popu
lar peer Linda Ronstadt.
The guitar picking of Brian
Ahern (who also produced and
engineered the album) and Al
bert Lee on the title track are
standouts in bluegrass talent.

But most of the numbers stay
with traditional one-two-three
rhythm countryballads.the kind
that whine wistfully with
romantic longing: "When 1 Stop
Dreaming" ("That's when I stop
loving you"), and "I'll be your
San Antone Rose."
Dolly Parton joins in on the
vocals in "Making Believe," and
vocalist Fayssoux Starling en
ters into a rare musical dialogue
between two female voices in
"Hello Stranger."
Luxury Liner is an excellent
album. Those who like country
music a la Ronstadt and Dolly
Parton should add Emmylou
Harris to their list.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)
