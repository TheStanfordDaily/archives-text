### Bill Burger 
The Stanford Hospital has received a
one-year accreditation from the Joint
Commission of Accreditation of Hos
pitals (JCAH) and the California Medi
cal Association (CMA).
The maximum accreditation a hos
pital can receive is two years. One-year
accreditations are issued when a hos
pital has deficiencies the groups be
lieve can be corrected within a year.
Accreditation can also be denied for
severe deficiencies.
Two concerns of the surveyors re
ceiving special attention are "de
ficiencies due to the high utilization of
the hospital and a lack of space," ac
cording to Hofmann.
This is the third consecutive one
year accreditation for the hospital.
The long-awaited decision relieves
what Dr. Clayton Rich, vice president
of medical center affairs, called in Feb
ruary "serious and urgent" state of af
fairs.
Surveyors from the two groups in
spected the hospital in January. They
reviewed the medical staff's organiza
tion, treatment of patients, and
documentation and evaluation of med
ical care.
The surveyor's recommendations
included improving the hospital's
corporate bylaws, medical staff
bylaws, service responsibilities within
the medical staff, departmental meet
ings, medical records and aspects of
physical facilities.
Spyros Andreopoulos, information
officer for the Medical Center, said "20
to 30 of the items on their (JCAH-CMA)
list have been corrected."
Dr. A. Walter Hoover, JCAH acting
program director, concurred with this
assessment, reporting that "many of
the problems cited by surveyors have
been corrected."
Hoover, in his report to the hospital,
said the JCAH and the CMA "com
mends the work that you have done
thus far toward achieving accredita
tion, but recognizes . . . that some
specific areas deserve special atten
tion."
All concerns of the surveyors are
now being address, Paul Hofmann, di
rector of the hospital and clinics, said.
A task force of senior management and
some physicians has been formed, ac
cording to Hofmann, to study the re
maining problems.
