A * by an event denotes tickets available at the Tresidder Ticket Office. Send all notices by the
preceding the week of publication to Spectrograph, Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Bldg , Stanford, OA
94305

"Spectograph," published each Thursday in the
Daily, attempts an exhaustive listing of events for
the week in entertainment and the arts as well as
discussions and lectures of interest to the Stanford
community.
Events listed occur both on the campus and in
the Bay Area.
Every effort will be made to include all notices
received prior to the deadline, but the Daily re
serves the right to edit "Spectrograph" according
to length; hence, there can be no absolute guaran
tee that an event will appear.
