Pope, Anglicans hold meeting
Vatican City — The archbishop of Canterbury
arrived yesterday for a series of meetings and
prayers with Pope Haul VI in an ecumenical
swing that may remove some of the obstacles to
unity of the Roman Catholic and Anglican
churches.
Donald Coggan was greeted by Jan Cardinal
Willebrands, who heads the Vatican's Secretariat
for Christian Unity, on his arrival from London.
The primate of the Church of England and
spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican
Communion, including Episcopalians in the Un
ited States, will meet twice with the Pope during
his three-day visit to Rome. The two religious
leaders will also pray together in the Vatican's
Sistine Chapel.
The meeting is the third such visit by an ar
chbishop of Canterbury since a 1960 meeting be
tween Geoffrey Pisher and Pope John XXIII
started healing a 400-year-old schism in the
Church.
The Anglican Church was established four
centuries ago by King Henry VIII who rejected
papal authority after Rome refused his divorce
from Catherine of Aragon.
The British party will leave Rome on Saturday
for Istanbul and talks with the patriarch of the
Eastern Orthodox Church, Demetrios I.
Oil blamed for record trade deficit
Washington — A 22 per cent increase in oil
imports resulting from unusually cold winter
pushed U.S. trade into a record monthly deficit of
$2.4 billion in March, the government reported
yesterday.
The trade deficit for the first three months of
1977 totaled $5.9 billion, which was greater than
the entire 1976 deficit and close to the record
yearly deficit of $6.4 billion in 1972.
Courtnay Slater, chief Commerce Department
economist, said the growing deficits are almost
entirely the result of increasing oil imports from
the oil-exporting nations.
The Carter administration saw the March trade
report as additional ammunition for the energy
program the president proposed last week. "This

underscores the importance of energy conserva
tion and the reducing of dependence on foreign
oil," said Slater, who prefers that designation.
While Slater said she expects substantial
monthly deficits will continue lor the remainder
of this year, she added, "It is reasonable to expect
some leveling off" of oil imports now that spring
is here.
Water rations cut on East Bay
Oakland — Girding for a long, dry summer,
officials have tightened water rations tor more
than a million people, while some businesses
and residents in the Bay Area complain they just
can't live with their allotments.
New water-use restrictions were voted lues
day for 1.1 million residents east of San Fran
cisco. The allotments are aimed at cutting water
use by 35 per cent, up from the 25 per cent offi
cials previously thought would be enough.
A spokesman for the Oakland Water District
said it expects Pardee Reservoir, its main source
of water in normal times, to go dry by the end of
the year.
In Oakland, San Francisco and Marin County,
some businesses and homeowners are beginning
to chafe under rationing they say is too strict or
unfair.
Carter asks for uranium control
Washington — President Jimmy Carter asked
Congress yesterday to put some legal teeth in his
nuclear nonproliferation efforts, which he
termed "one of mankind's most pressing chal
lenges."
In a special message, Carter called for quick
enactment of a new law regulating exports of
American-produced uranium to foreign buyers.
If Congress agrees, a new law would under
score Carter's stated objective to ban exports of
uranium reprocessing plants that would be capa
ble of producing the plutonium that is used in
nuclear weapons.
It also would give congressional sanction to a
policy of denying uranium exports to any nation
— other than those that have already done so —

that detonates a nuclear explosive device, or fails
to abide by safeguards for uranium usage estab
lished by the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
CIA costs may be made public
Washington — The director of the CIA said
yesterday that despite some rish, the over-all cost
of U.S. intelligence activities could be made pub
lic. But a cost breakdown — even by agencies —
would be helpful to the nation's enemies, he said.
"There is a risk in every disclosure, but all of us
feel the responsibility to be as open with the
country as possible, so the need warrants the risk
being taken," Adm. Stansfield Turner told the
Senate Intelligence committee.
However, three former CIA directors, William
Colby, Richard Helms and George Bush, took
sharp exception to revealing any details of intel
ligence spending. They warned that while an
over-all figure might not mean much by itself, its
publication would lead to inevitable demands for
further disclosures.
Unofficial estimates of the annual cost of U.S.
intelligence activities have ranged from $4 bill
ion upward, generally hidden as expenditures
for various other activities in the federal budget.
Brown unveils anti-crime bills
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown. Jr. yes
terday unveiled an eight-point anti-crime pac
kage which he said was aimed at making Califor
nia a more secure place to live.
The package's major proposal would alter the
state's current probation subsidy program, which
now pays about $23 million to county probation
departments each year.
The program, signed into law in 1965 by
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, was designed to lower
commitments to state prison and compensate
counties for the cost of their local probation prog
rams.
Counties now are paid up to $4000 per inmate
each year for numerical reductions below their
projected commitment rate to state facilities,
state officials said.
Brown also advocated letting county boards of

supervisors spend the state money now spent on
probation programs for any criminal justice pur
pose they select.
FBI warned against law breaking
Washington — FBI Director Clarence Kelley
was told yesterday there is no excuse for FBI
agents to break the law, even if approval is given
by higher governmental officials.
Kelley also was summoned to a House hearing
next week to explain protests within the FBI
against the indictment of an FBI agent for al
legedly illegal mail opening and wiretapping.
At a Senate hearing, Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-
Conn.), told kelley: "You can't legalize law
breaking in this country." In the Nuernburg trials
of Nazi war criminals, "this nation of all nations"
rejected the idea that an illegal act could be ex
cused because it was done on orders, Weicker
added.
Kelley and his aides were questioned about the
recent indictment of John Kearney, a former FBI
supervisor in the bureau's New York City office.
The indictment, which Kelley said has had a
bad effect on FBI morale, accuses Kearney of il
legal wiretapping, mail opening and conspiracy
in connection with surveillance activities in the
early 1970s against Weatherman, a suspected
underground terrorist organization.
■ Kelley said he had not asked the attorney gen
eral to drop the case against Kearney but only to
review it in light of the Justice Department's de
cision not to prosecute CIA agents involved in a
mail opening operation.
