Correction
The article in yesterday's Daily may
have incorrectly implied that the two
Taiwanese students interviewed who
claim that no KMT informers exist on
campus were interviewed together.
This was not the case.
The KMT student was incorrectly
quoted as being born in mainland
China. None of the Taiwanese students
interviewed were born in mainland
China. It was the non-KMT student's
family which fled the mainland when
the communists took over, not the fam
ily of the KMT member.
