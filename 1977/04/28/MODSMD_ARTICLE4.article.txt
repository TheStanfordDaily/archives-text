# Soviet human rights fight growing, says Litvinov
## 
### Jacob Young 
"The greatest development in
human rights in the Soviet Union has
been to make incidents of arrest pub
lic," Soviet dissident Pavel Litvinov
said here last night.
Litvinov, editor of the Chronicle of
Human Rights in the Soviet Union, is
considered by many to be a leader in
the democratic wing of the Soviet
human rights movement.
The struggle for human rights is
growing in the Soviet Union, Litvinov
said, and "despite many arrests, new
supporters continue to come."
Support necessary
But he also warned that interna
tional support for Soviet dissidents is
necessary if the movement is to sur
vive.
"I support President Jimmy Carter's

stand on human rights. But his support
may not continue without support
from the American people," he said.
Trained as a physicist, Litvinov
moved into the area of human rights
after the arrest of several of his friends
for subversive activities. He was expel
led from his position as a physics in
structor at Moscow's Institute of Preci
sion Chemical Technology in 1968.
Arrested
Litvinov was arrested for his part in
a demonstration protesting the Soviet
invasion of Czechoslovakia, and spent
four years in Siberian exile. He is the
grandson of former Soviet foreign
minister Maxim Litvinkov. who held
that position in Stalin's regime until
he was removed from office.
According to Litvinkov. another
major problem for the Soviet human

rights movement is the relative lack of
freely flowing information about dis
sident activities in the whole nation.
From the public media in the Soviet
Union "you will know about many
pleasant facts — some collective has
made its quota of cows or a shortage of
some product is nearly over. Any bad
news about crime will come not from
Moscow, but from New York," hesaid.
Soviet censorship is so widespread,
Litvinkov said, "even pictures on a
matchbox cannot be published with
out official approval. Often even the
word 'censorship' cannot be printed.
No one can even say that censorship
exists."
No Xerox
This makes it exceedingly difficult
for literature on the human rights

movement to circulate. "You can't just
go to a Xerox machine in Moxcow to
make copies," he said.
However, he also said there is wide
spread underground circulation of
typed philosophy manuscripts and
Soviet fiction. He also said these typed
manuscripts often make it out of the
Soviet Union and are published ab
road. Many then return to the Soviet
Union in bound form.
The future of Soviet human rights
"depends on international support
especially in the West. I hope things
will become, not only more human,
but more flexible in the Soviet Union,"
he said.
Litvinov's appearance was spon
sored by the Hoover Institution and the
Committee on Russian and East Euro
pean Studies.

after the arrest of several of his friends
for subversive activities. He was expel
led from his position as a physics in
structor at Moscow's Institute of Preci
sion Chemical Technology in 1968.
Arrested
Litvinov was arrested for his part in
a demonstration protesting the Soviet
invasion of Czechoslovakia, and spent
four years in Siberian exile. He is the
grandson of former Soviet foreign
minister Maxim Litvinkov. who held
that position in Stalin's regime until
he was removed from office.
According to Litvinkov. another
major problem for the Soviet human

rights movement is the relative lack of
freely flowing information about dis
sident activities in the whole nation.
From the public media in the Soviet
Union "you will know about many
pleasant facts — some collective has
made its quota of cows or a shortage of
some product is nearly over. Any bad
news about crime will come not from
Moscow, but from New York," hesaid.
Soviet censorship is so widespread,
Litvinkov said, "even pictures on a
matchbox cannot be published with
out official approval. Often even the
word 'censorship' cannot be printed.
No one can even say that censorship
exists."
No Xerox
This makes it exceedingly difficult
for literature on the human rights

movement to circulate. "You can't just
go to a Xerox machine in Moxcow to
make copies," he said.
However, he also said there is wide
spread underground circulation of
typed philosophy manuscripts and
Soviet fiction. He also said these typed
manuscripts often make it out of the
Soviet Union and are published ab
road. Many then return to the Soviet
Union in bound form.
The future of Soviet human rights
"depends on international support
especially in the West. I hope things
will become, not only more human,
but more flexible in the Soviet Union,"
he said.
Litvinov's appearance was spon
sored by the Hoover Institution and the
Committee on Russian and East Euro
pean Studies.


Pavel Litvinov
"The greatest development in
human rights in the Soviet Union has
been to make incidents of arrest pub
lic," Soviet dissident Pavel Litvinov
said here last night.
Litvinov, editor of the Chronicle of
Human Rights in the Soviet Union, is
considered by many to be a leader in
the democratic wing of the Soviet
human rights movement.
The struggle for human rights is
growing in the Soviet Union, Litvinov
said, and "despite many arrests, new
supporters continue to come."
Support necessary
But he also warned that interna
tional support for Soviet dissidents is
necessary if the movement is to sur
vive.
"I support President Jimmy Carter's

stand on human rights. But his support
may not continue without support
from the American people," he said.
Trained as a physicist, Litvinov
moved into the area of human rights
after the arrest of several of his friends
for subversive activities. He was expel
led from his position as a physics in
structor at Moscow's Institute of Preci
sion Chemical Technology in 1968.
