# Kuomintang activity alleged
## Taiwanese informers reported on other campuses 
### Kurt Cobb Second of three parts 
Reports of informers among the
Taiwanese student community are not
restricted to Stanford. So far, there
have been reports of such surveillance
on at least nine other college campuses
including UC-Berkeley and the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT).
An incident at MIT illustrates what
may be going on, mostly because the
school itself decided to investigate the
occurrence. The investigation was un
dertaken by Louis Menand 111, special
assistant to the provost at MIT, who
subsequently filed a report.
According to the report, on Feb. 6,
1976, the Social Action Coordinating
Committee (SAAC) of MIT sponsored a
forum on the Taiwan Training Prog
ram conducted by MIT for the Taiwan
government.
The program was training 15
Taiwanese students in technology
applicable to missile guidance.
Consulate member
Several Taiwanese students present
at the forum criticized the program,
the report said. Also present were a
Taiwan consulate member and a
Taiwanese MIT student who took pic
tures of the forum.
Menand reported that some
Taiwanese students and members of
the SACC suspected the picture-taker
of being an informer for the Kuomin

tang (KMT â€”the ruling Chinese
Nationalist party in Taiwan).
After the meeting, they immediately
approached him and demanded his
film. At first the picture-taker refused
to surrender the film, saying it was his
property.
Eventually a patrolman was sum
moned and he mediated an exchange,
the report said. The picture-taker sur
rendered the film. In exchange, vid
eotape on which the forum and ensu
ing incident had been recorded was
erased so other Taiwanese students
would not find out about the incident.
His scrapbook
The picture-taker claimed he was
simply taking pictures for his scrap
book, Menand wrote in the report.
Many snapshots were of MIT. seeming
to support the student's claim.
Some pictures, however, were of in
dividuals who attended the forum, and
one was of the SACC booth in the
building which advertised the forum.
After interviews with students, fa
culty and the consular official in
volved in the incident, Menand con
cluded there was sufficient informa
tion "to warrant a further and more
detailed inquiry by some national
education group into foreign surveil
lance activities by home governments
on their own nationals in this coun
try."
Menand noted frequently that al
though there is no hard evidence, stu

dents believe they are being watched
and conduct their lives accordingly.
'Phone calls'
Last spring, the University of
Chicago's Chicago Maroon, wrote that
Taiwanese students reported receiv
ing "threatening phone calls and
anonymous letters warning them to
stop participating in certain ac
tivities."
A University of Florida student from
Taiwan submitted a signed affidavit to
the Gainesville Sun which said he had
been asked to spy on his fellow coun
trymen.
Because of a request from MIT and
widespread concern about the prob
lem, the National Association of
Foreign Student Advisers decided last
year to set up a commission to investi
gate the matter.
The commission reported its initial
findings this year. It came to essen
tially the same conclusion as Menand,
who said the Taiwanese government
"may operate a nationwide surveil
lance system to watch its students in
the United States.
Return to Taiwan
Taiwanese students here say even
though they are being watched, the re
lative freedom they enjoy while in the
United States makes some wish to re
main here. One student said he is not
sure he wants to return to Taiwan
under the present conditions.

Taiwan, or the Republic of China
(ROC), is a small island off the coast of
mainland China with a population of
16 million.
Eighty-six percent are indigenous
Taiwanese and 14 per cent are Chinese
mainlanders who followed the
Kuomintang to Taiwan in 1949 after
the Communist takeover.
The ROC constitution guarantees
freedom of speech, press, religion, re
sidence, assembly and petition. The
government, controlled by the KMT
party, has continued to abrogate these
rights under the provisions of martial
law which was declared in May 1949
and continues to this day, according to
Amnesty International (AI).
State of siege
The ROC government says it is still
in a state of siege with Communist
China and claims the ROC government
is the legitimate government of all
China. It says the siege and thus mar
tial law will continue until the "com
munist rebellion" on the mainland has
ended.
The government consists of five
main branches or yuans, the executive,
legislative, judicial, examination and
control. The highest legislative yuan
consists largely of members elected on
the mainland in 1948.
These members are theoretically
freely elected, but since elections on
the mainland are now impossible, they
hold their seats for life. Because of the

inevitable attrition in the body's size,
elections were recently held for 22 of
the 452 seats in 1969, the AI briefing
says.
The KMT, however, continues to
dominate elections, partly because
opposing candidates are warned and
sometimes incarcerated for statements
judged "contrary to national policy,"
according to the AI briefing.
Arrested
In one case, a local Taiwanese can
didate in the December 1975 elections,
Pai Ya-tsan, was arrested for publish
ing a campaign statement consisting of
29 questions addressed to Premier
Chiang Ching-kuo, son of late Presi
dent Chiang Kai-shek.
The questions dealt with corruption,
foreign policy, martial law and other
sensitive areas, said the AI brief. Pai
Ya-tsan was tried in secret and sen
tenced to life imprisonment.
According to ). Bruce Jacobs in an arti
cle in China Quarterly, the real power
in the government rests with the
KMT's Central Standing Committee.
He explains that since there is much
overlap in party and government or
gans, the distinction between them is
essentially formal. Membership of the
committee is controlled by party lead
ers.
The ROC has long received exten
sive American support. The United
States gave the ROC over $2.6 billion
in grants and credits from the end of

World War II to 1976, according to the
1976 U.S. Statistical abstract.
The New York Times reported the
United States has sold more than $500
million in arms to the ROCsince 1975.
Estimates of U.S. investments run in
the hundreds of millions uf dollars.
Checked carefully
According to students here, mail be
tween Taiwan and Hong Kong is al
ways checked carefully and a sampl
ing is made of mail from other areas.
The press is carefully censored.
Sometimes entire issues are with
held like the "Nixon Visits Peking"
issue. Students here say they need to
obtain a permit from Taiwanese police
for any social or political gathering.
The government maintains a Fed
eral Bureau of Investigation similar to
the United States' and also a police
organization called the Taiwan Garri
son Command (TGC). The TGC is able
to arrest and detain persons without
charge for indefinite periods, accord
ing to the A 1 brief. Trials of political
and some serious criminal offenders
are held in secret by military courts,
while other cases are tried in civilian
courts.
AI estimates there may be as many as
8000 political prisoners in Taiwan, al
though the government admits to only
400 political detainees.
