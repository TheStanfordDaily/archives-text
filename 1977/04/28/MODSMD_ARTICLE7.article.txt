## Opinions Letters to the editor Idi Amin, griffins, Band's sexism 
### 
Amin justified
Idi Amin of Uganda has been
publicly called "a crazed,
syphilitic butcher, who has kil
led thousands senselessly." He
has also been accused of pulling
the trigger of the gun that re
cently killed a bishop, this last
accusation unproven. At the re
cent Afro-Arab conlerence in
Egypt his harsh and brutal rule
brought him "snubs" from the
more "humane" oil rich leadrs,
who also refused him monetary
aid.
But for the sake of brevity let
us assume he is guilty of all ac
cusations. What I can't figure out
is why he is taking these actions
out on whites and blacks alike,
on clerics and why he and other
African countries so dislike
whites and clerics since they
have been the recipients of so
much from the outside world.
Decades ago missionaries, un
invited went to Africa to spread
the word of God, and while
doing so also taught Africans to
wear clothes, worship a different
deity than the one they had, and
to do away with tribal cere
monies. In short, they changed
their entire culture and way of
living all in the name of salva
tion.
Where in the Bible does it say
to disrupt and change pure cul
tures which were God given to
start with, and in the name of
salvation — from what?
They also were given by the
outside world slavery, syphilis
in place of yaws, guns in place of
spears, military uniforms with
medals in place of necklaces and
loin cloths, wars in place of tri
bal laws, and they had their
lands literally raped because of
their natural resources plus
many other benefits.
Is it any wonder that the "en
lightened" Africa produces
leaders like Amin?
I have seen a poster depicting
God saying to Earth below him,
"I want all of you people on
Earth to vacate by the first of the

month, I have a new client who
is interested in the property."
Verily I say, this poster is no
joke; it is a damning prophecy.

May I please take a moment to
respond to Bruce Anderson's ar
ticle (Daily, March 30). Ander
son wrote a very interesting
piece on griffins.
I have been collecting griffins
for almost 10 years now and my
collection totals over 1200 of
these wonderful, magic friends.
In the course of adding to my
collection, I have done a great
deal of studying and research on
these truly magnificent crea
tures.
In the second paragraph of his
story, Anderson states, "Advo
cates claim that the griffin repre
sents dignity, power and grace.
Griffins are purported to have
been moral, intelligent creatures
that were fierce and awesome
fighters, attacking from air and
land." All of this is true but there
is more. Griffins are highly ethi
cal creatures and are only fierce
and awesome fighters when that
which they are guarding is
threatened. They are not openly
aggressive without provocation.
In view of the loss of dignity
that the native American has suf
fered in so many ways in this
country, and, conversely, being
aware of the great dignity that
griffins possess, I cannot help
but feel that they are a perfect
choice to represent California's
finest school.
After all, I assume you want
your athletes to be winners and
griffins really do not like to lose!
Onward Griffins!

Bill Graham Presents
Band's campaign
I think that everyone would
agree with Julia and Nea
Brown's letter (Daily, April 25)

declaiming the use of sexist pub
licity materials in the Band's re
cent fee assessment campaign.
There are, however, more impor
tant points involved than just the
inability to interchange male
and female symbols.
The Band itself in its adminis
tration and membership is not a
sexist organization. There are
women on the staff and there are
many women who participate in
the Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers (SMUT) meetings,
when the policies and half-time
shows are planned out.
How, then, could the Band
stoop to such low humor? Quite
simply because they knew that
this was the way to succeed; this
sexist advertising campaign
brought out IV2 times the
number of students who voted in

the Council of Presidents elec
tion. This is, in fact, the most
frightening aspect of the
campaign—not that the Band
crossed "the fine line between
sexual humor and sexist
humor," but that such crossing
was appreciated hy such a large
number of students!
The Band's job is to be clever
throughout theyear. This is most
difficult; the law of averages says
that not everyone can be pleased
constantly with the quality of the
humor. Therefore, the shocking
element of the fee assessment
campaign is not that the Band
told this particular joke, but that
so many of our peers laughed.

Is it any wonder that the "en

leaders like Amin?
I have seen a poster depicting
God saying to Earth below him,
"I want all of you people on
Earth to vacate by the first of the

Verily I say, this poster is no
joke; it is a damning prophecy.

May I please take a moment to
respond to Bruce Anderson's ar
ticle (Daily, March 30). Ander
son wrote a very interesting
piece on griffins.
I have been collecting griffins
for almost 10 years now and my
collection totals over 1200 of
these wonderful, magic friends.
In the course of adding to my
collection, I have done a great
deal of studying and research on
these truly magnificent crea
tures.
In the second paragraph of his
story, Anderson states, "Advo
cates claim that the griffin repre
sents dignity, power and grace.
Griffins are purported to have
been moral, intelligent creatures
that were fierce and awesome
fighters, attacking from air and
land." All of this is true but there
is more. Griffins are highly ethi
cal creatures and are only fierce
and awesome fighters when that
which they are guarding is
threatened. They are not openly
aggressive without provocation.
In view of the loss of dignity
that the native American has suf
fered in so many ways in this
country, and, conversely, being
aware of the great dignity that
griffins possess, I cannot help
but feel that they are a perfect
choice to represent California's
finest school.
After all, I assume you want
your athletes to be winners and
griffins really do not like to lose!
Onward Griffins!

Band's campaign
I think that everyone would
agree with Julia and Nea
Brown's letter (Daily, April 25)

declaiming the use of sexist pub
licity materials in the Band's re
cent fee assessment campaign.
There are, however, more impor
tant points involved than just the
inability to interchange male
and female symbols.
The Band itself in its adminis
tration and membership is not a
sexist organization. There are
women on the staff and there are
many women who participate in
the Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers (SMUT) meetings,
when the policies and half-time
shows are planned out.
How, then, could the Band
stoop to such low humor? Quite
simply because they knew that
this was the way to succeed; this
sexist advertising campaign
brought out IV2 times the
number of students who voted in

the Council of Presidents elec
tion. This is, in fact, the most
frightening aspect of the
campaign—not that the Band
crossed "the fine line between
sexual humor and sexist
humor," but that such crossing
was appreciated hy such a large
number of students!
The Band's job is to be clever
throughout theyear. This is most
difficult; the law of averages says
that not everyone can be pleased
constantly with the quality of the
humor. Therefore, the shocking
element of the fee assessment
campaign is not that the Band
told this particular joke, but that
so many of our peers laughed.

Amin justified
Idi Amin of Uganda has been
publicly called "a crazed,
syphilitic butcher, who has kil
led thousands senselessly." He
has also been accused of pulling
the trigger of the gun that re
cently killed a bishop, this last
accusation unproven. At the re
cent Afro-Arab conlerence in
Egypt his harsh and brutal rule
brought him "snubs" from the
more "humane" oil rich leadrs,
who also refused him monetary
aid.
But for the sake of brevity let
us assume he is guilty of all ac
cusations. What I can't figure out
is why he is taking these actions
out on whites and blacks alike,
on clerics and why he and other
African countries so dislike
whites and clerics since they
have been the recipients of so
much from the outside world.
Decades ago missionaries, un
invited went to Africa to spread
the word of God, and while
doing so also taught Africans to
wear clothes, worship a different
deity than the one they had, and
to do away with tribal cere
monies. In short, they changed
their entire culture and way of
living all in the name of salva
tion.
Where in the Bible does it say
to disrupt and change pure cul
tures which were God given to
start with, and in the name of
salvation — from what?
They also were given by the

cates claim that the griffin repre
sents dignity, power and grace.
Griffins are purported to have
been moral, intelligent creatures
that were fierce and awesome
fighters, attacking from air and
land." All of this is true but there
is more. Griffins are highly ethi
cal creatures and are only fierce
and awesome fighters when that
which they are guarding is
threatened. They are not openly
aggressive without provocation.
In view of the loss of dignity
that the native American has suf
fered in so many ways in this
country, and, conversely, being
aware of the great dignity that
griffins possess, I cannot help
but feel that they are a perfect
choice to represent California's
finest school.
After all, I assume you want
your athletes to be winners and
griffins really do not like to lose!
Onward Griffins!

Bill Graham Presents
Band's campaign
I think that everyone would
agree with Julia and Nea
Brown's letter (Daily, April 25)

declaiming the use of sexist pub
licity materials in the Band's re
cent fee assessment campaign.
There are, however, more impor
tant points involved than just the
inability to interchange male
and female symbols.
The Band itself in its adminis
tration and membership is not a
sexist organization. There are
women on the staff and there are
many women who participate in
the Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers (SMUT) meetings,
when the policies and half-time
shows are planned out.
How, then, could the Band
stoop to such low humor? Quite
simply because they knew that
this was the way to succeed; this
sexist advertising campaign
brought out IV2 times the
number of students who voted in

the Council of Presidents elec
tion. This is, in fact, the most
frightening aspect of the
campaign—not that the Band
crossed "the fine line between
sexual humor and sexist
humor," but that such crossing
was appreciated hy such a large
number of students!
The Band's job is to be clever
throughout theyear. This is most
difficult; the law of averages says
that not everyone can be pleased
constantly with the quality of the
humor. Therefore, the shocking
element of the fee assessment
campaign is not that the Band
told this particular joke, but that
so many of our peers laughed.
