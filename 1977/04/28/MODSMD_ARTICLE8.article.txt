# 'Drinker's supplement' harmful

Barry Bakin

I would like to protest against
the "Drinker's supplement"
(Daily, April 19). Alcoholism
among young people is increas
ing at an alarming rate and any
such promotions are bound to
worsen the problem.
Some of my friends tried to
show me that the supplement
was actually critical of alcohol
and was just an exercise in jour
nalistic coverage, but I don't be
lieve it. Any expose concerning
drinking in which every adver
tisement plugs a bar or liquor, is
one whose goals are confusing
and contradictory.
For example, I would be wary
of a TV expose of multinational
corporations sponsoed by Exxon
or IBM. Also, it is hard to take
seriously an article entitled,
"Preteen drinking on the rise"
when it is surrounded by beer
promotions and pictures of stu
dents clustered around kegs.
'Flexible commodity'
Incidentally, amidst all of
these advertisements comes the

statement from the article on the
sociology class: "It's a flexible
commodity, appropriate for
happy occasions as well as de
pressive fits. It's also overcom
mercialized. A plethora of liquor
advertisements leer from the
pages of magazines, billboards,
the tube...." Maybe newspapers
should be added to this list.
As I perused the ad on the final
page showing a bikini
cladwoman being ogled by some
male students, I couldn't help
but recall the statements in the
same article concerning the
"sexist tinge" to the marketing
of drinking.
The very title "Drinker's sup
plement" implies articles writ
ten for drinkers by drinkers with
the goal of increasing the acces
sibility, desirability and profita
bility of drinking.
Glorify drinking
Just as a "Skier's supplement"
implies articles and features
which would promote and
glorify skiing, so does a "Drink

er's supplement." The differ
ence of course, is that drinking
has been identified as a much
greater social problem than ski
ing.
I am very concerned about the
sentiments expressed in the cap
tion in the photo panorama of
Stanford drinkers on page 11:
"No matter how much pain and
tribulation you may be going
through at any moment, relief is
only as far away as a friend with
a bottle."
Statements like this can only
encourage an upswing in drink
ing and coming from the Daily,
givesa stamp of official approval
to escaping from one's problems
through alcohol. When 47 per
cent of the students asked indi
cate they drink specifically to get
drunk, there is something wrong
with their environment.
Friendship better
If one of every two people is
trying to leave a system, then
there is somehthing wrong with
that system and efforts should be

made to rectify the problem, not
make it easier to escape it, as in
this instance promoting drink
ing. The Daily would hold a
much better attitude if it
changed its caption to "Relief is
only as far away as a friend!"
Placing one's trust and confi
dence in one's friends is much
healthierthan seeking the bottle.
I am curious as to whether the
Daily would consider running a
"Smoker's supplement," con
cerning an activity which is not
illegal but still has detrimental
societal aspects and would
probably be considered as inap
propriate for such coverage.
I feel that alcoholism is a sub
ject which the Daily should be
investigating for its negative as
pects and the consequences of its
existence in the University
community, not one which
should be utilized for promo
tional and commercial purposes.

If one of every two people is
trying to leave a system, then
there is somehthing wrong with
that system and efforts should be

made to rectify the problem, not
make it easier to escape it, as in
this instance promoting drink
ing. The Daily would hold a
much better attitude if it
changed its caption to "Relief is
only as far away as a friend!"
Placing one's trust and confi
dence in one's friends is much
healthierthan seeking the bottle.
I am curious as to whether the
Daily would consider running a
"Smoker's supplement," con
cerning an activity which is not
illegal but still has detrimental
societal aspects and would
probably be considered as inap
propriate for such coverage.
I feel that alcoholism is a sub
ject which the Daily should be
investigating for its negative as
pects and the consequences of its
existence in the University
community, not one which
should be utilized for promo
tional and commercial purposes.

I would like to protest against
the "Drinker's supplement"
(Daily, April 19). Alcoholism
among young people is increas
ing at an alarming rate and any
such promotions are bound to
worsen the problem.
Some of my friends tried to
show me that the supplement
was actually critical of alcohol
and was just an exercise in jour
nalistic coverage, but I don't be
lieve it. Any expose concerning
drinking in which every adver
tisement plugs a bar or liquor, is
one whose goals are confusing
and contradictory.
For example, I would be wary
of a TV expose of multinational
corporations sponsoed by Exxon
or IBM. Also, it is hard to take
seriously an article entitled,
"Preteen drinking on the rise"
when it is surrounded by beer
promotions and pictures of stu
dents clustered around kegs.
'Flexible commodity'
Incidentally, amidst all of
these advertisements comes the

statement from the article on the
sociology class: "It's a flexible
commodity, appropriate for
happy occasions as well as de
pressive fits. It's also overcom
mercialized. A plethora of liquor
advertisements leer from the
pages of magazines, billboards,
the tube...." Maybe newspapers
should be added to this list.
As I perused the ad on the final
page showing a bikini
cladwoman being ogled by some
male students, I couldn't help
but recall the statements in the
same article concerning the
"sexist tinge" to the marketing
of drinking.
The very title "Drinker's sup
plement" implies articles writ
ten for drinkers by drinkers with
the goal of increasing the acces
sibility, desirability and profita
bility of drinking.
Glorify drinking
Just as a "Skier's supplement"
implies articles and features
which would promote and
glorify skiing, so does a "Drink

er's supplement." The differ
ence of course, is that drinking
has been identified as a much
greater social problem than ski
ing.
I am very concerned about the
sentiments expressed in the cap
tion in the photo panorama of
Stanford drinkers on page 11:
"No matter how much pain and
tribulation you may be going
through at any moment, relief is
only as far away as a friend with
a bottle."
Statements like this can only
encourage an upswing in drink
ing and coming from the Daily,
givesa stamp of official approval
to escaping from one's problems
through alcohol. When 47 per
cent of the students asked indi
cate they drink specifically to get
drunk, there is something wrong
with their environment.
