# Carter energy plan

Last week, President Jimmy
Carter unveiled before Congress
and the country the most com
prehensive energy package ever
presented by a president. Highly
controversial, it stands as a sup
reme test of Carter's ability to
lead the country and to hang
tough under pressure.
Although there are some as
pects of the plan which are
deeply troubling, the mere fact
that Carter has put words into
action is a refreshing change. It
is clear that he has forced the
hand of a do-nothing Congress
which has been rousted out of a
four-year slumber during which
it has shown tremendous irres
ponsibility by balking at one of
the most pressing issues this
country faces.
Carter's plan has little regard
for special interest groups and
lobbyists, and it strikes at tender
spots of nearly every American.
Yet the hope that something—
finally—is going to be done
about the existing energy di
lemma is a relief to those of us
who care about the welfare of
this country beyond the next 10
years.
The strengths of Carter's pac
kage are many, and while we
will not attempt to present an
analysis of each of Carter's prop
osals, we will consider the most
important aspects.
Tax credit
The best proposal which Car
ter has put forth is one which
would allow a special 10 per
cent tax credit for industries that
undertake energy conservation
measures such as "co
generation" of electricity and
usable steam and heat. The po
tential benefit to a company
which pursues such energy
saving methods goes beyond the
tax credit; for if a company is
given the tax credit, it will be
able to lower the price of its
commodities, which would
bring increased sales, increased
production due to higher de
mand, and — more importantly,
— increased profits. Not only
that, but such a measure would
tend to reduce the federal
bureaucracy because fewer tax
dollars would have to be hand
led by fewer hands.
Another proposal which offers
a clear-cut solution to a specific
energy problem is tax incentives
for nearly 22 million homes
which install solar power units
for heating and cooling.

Yet another promising prop
osal is the one which provides
tax breaks for businesses and
homeowners who insulate
buildings to meet desired stan
dards. One of the worst wastes of
energy is the leakage of heated
and cooled air through poorly
insulated walls and ceilings.
The Energy Research and De
velopment Agency (ERDA) has
estimated that utility bills could
be reduced by as much as 25 per
cent if homes and buildings
were properly insulated.
Along with the bright spots,
however, there are a couple of
dangerous disappointments
which strike at the very heart of
the notion that Americans are
free to rule themselves. The
worst proposal is the standby
gasoline tax, which would be
levied in five-cent increments
beginning in if gasoline
consumption were not reduced
by 10 per cent. This proposal
makes government bigger and
more powerful while endanger
ing the personal freedom of
every American. Nobel Prize
winning economist Milton
Friedman criticized the proposal
for "nationalizing the produc
tion and distribution of energy.
The provision, says Friedman,
"introduces the hands of the
bureaucrats into every stage of
pricing, production and con
sumption."
If Carter's goal is to discourage
gasoline consumption and to
encourage alternate energy
sources, clearly the best option
would be to deregulate the price
of oil and allow the free market
to do the rest.
No stimuli
Again, quoting Friedman:
"All of the various taxes have the
desirable objective of restricting
consumption, but they do no
thing to stimulate supply. Sim
ply letting the market price rule
would have exactly the same ef
fect on consumption, but it
would also have a much stronger
effect on production, in the
sense that it would give people
an incentive to produce new
sources of energy and of crude
oil. This is a one-armed ap
proach, with all the emphasis on
consumption and very little, ex
cept in words, on production."
The free market will satisfy all
of Carter's objectives—
discouragement of waste, en
couragement of alternate

sources and more efficient util
ity of energy appliances—
without government interfer
ence, which is the arch-enemy of
a truly democratic society.
Another disturbing proposal
is the one which levies a
graduated tux on automobiles
getting less than 13 miles per
gallon of gas. Again, this prop
osal tends to increase the federal
bureaucracy and put govern
ment in a place where it should
not be. Again, the solution is to
rely on the free market.
Gas costs
It is clear that with deregula
tion of gas prices, it would get
more and more expensive to own
a gas-guzzling automobile and
more and more practical to own
a smaller and more efficient
auto. Moreover, cities such as
New York and Boston—where
mass transit is terrible —and Los
Angeles and Houston—where
mass transit is non-existent —
would be encouraged to make
mass transit a top priority.
The Carter plan presents
strong encouragement and hope
to an America that has been held
in limbo on the energy crisis for
half a decade by Congress. For
once, Congress cannot refuse to
act, for Carter has pulled the
political strings which have
forced the lackadaisical Con
gress to do something. For that,
he must be thanked whole
heartedly.
In addition, he must be re
spected for disregarding the
hordes of special interest groups
which have stifled the legisla
tive branch for a decade.
Socialized energy
On the other hand, Carter has
proposed measures which are
clearly the first steps toward
socializing energy.With sociali
zation comes a denial of the
basic American right of indi
vidual freedom. This fact must
be recognized and acted upon,
and it is up to the conservative
leaders in the House and Senate
to be spokesmen for this cause.
The preservation of individual
freedom must be our overriding
priority. It must be preserved,
and this is not contradictory to
the creation of a responsible
energy policy. Dependence on
the free market, in deference to
Carter, is the ultimate answer.
