PG&E needs bright well
educated civil, electrical or
mechanical engineers to
work on difficult and com
plex problems.
The burden is heavy. The
problems are many. It's
our job to provide enough
energy for the essential
needs of the public and the
tremendous environmental
housecleaning job that needs
to be done in waste recy
cling, smog-free rapid transit,
fume incineration, and
water purification. All of
these tasks will require large
amounts of gas and electric
energy.
If you're genuinely con
cerned about people and the
environment, and are man
or woman enough to work
for realistic solutions to near
impossible problems—PG&E
would welcome your help.
The pay is good and we'll
give you all the responsi
bility you can handle.

view, contact John Clemson,

ment Office at
