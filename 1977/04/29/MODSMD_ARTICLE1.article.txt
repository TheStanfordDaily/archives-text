# Taiwanese argue over whether consulate does spying
## 
### Kurt Cobb Last of three parts 
The San Francisco consulate of Taiwan is
the hub of surveillance activities against
Taiwanese students on the west coast, ac
cording to Taiwanese students here.
The consulate, however, firmly denies
participation in any surveillance activities.
Kien Shien, assistant consul for cultural
affairs, said, "This office is strictly for stu
dent service. I haven't heard of anything"
like this in government.
Most sources asked for anonymity be
cause they said they fear reprisals if quoted
by name.
Taiwanese students here say the Kuomin
tang party (KMT â€”the ruling Nationalist
Chinese party in Taiwan) has student mem
bers on this campus and around the United
States who conduct the surveillance ac
tivities. These informers are said to meet
two or three times a year to report progress
and discuss strategy.
Lake Tahoe
In a series of copyrighted articles, the
Daily Californian reported a mpeting of the
supposed KMT surveillance organization,
the "Anti-Communist Patriotic League," at
Lake Tahoe in June 1975. An agenda of the
meeting was obtained by the Daily Califor
nian.
Topics on that agenda included "gaining
control of the Chinese Students Associations
on each campus and disrupting pro
communist activities...damaging the repu
tations of the heads of pro-communist
groups, publishing newsletters and expos
ing leftist activities," according to the story.
One source here said a similar meeting
was also held last year at Lake Tahoe with

almost identical subjects being discussed.
One Taiwanese student here, a KMT
member, confirmed that both Tahoe meet
ings took place. He said he had attended the
meetings, but did not consider the persons
participating in them as part of a special
group.
"Any (Taiwanese) student can join the
group," he said. He also said he had not
heard the group called by the name men
tioned above.
Student opinions
He said the meetings were sponsored by
the Taiwanese government for the purpose
of eliciting student opinions on such
foreign policy topics as Taiwan's relations
with the United States and Communist
China.
Taiwanese students here say they can
identify several students here whom they
strongly suspect are KMT informers.
They say they have no hard proof, and that
because of the secretiveness of KMT opera
tions, such proof is virtually impossible to
obtain.
After all, they say, proof would require
showing that reports are actually being
made to consulate officials or that money or
other compensation was given to a student
from the government. The latter criterion
poses a further problem in that many
students, KMT and non-KMT, are here on
government scholarships.
Students here also say their passports are
renewed every three years, but "for people
who make trouble, every three to six
months."
They say the consulate in San Francisco
used to revoke passports of some outspoken
critics of the government, an action which
required offenders to return home im

mediately.
This procedure, however, made it too
easy for these students to claim they were
being persecuted on political grounds and
thus seek political asylum. Only one stu
dent, though, said he knew of a case where
political asylum had been granted.
Consul George Chao of the San Francisco
consulate denied the use of three and six
month renewal periods for certain
passports.
He said almost all passports are issued for
three years and renewed for three years,
with the sole exception of special two-year
passports issued to students who are train
ing in the United States for a specific gov
ernment job and whose expenses are paid
by the government. Chao also said, "We
have never revoked any passports."
Although informing activities may not be
illegal in themselves, U.S. Asst. Atty. John
O'Connor said anyone working as an agent
for a foreign country must register with the
U.S. government. Failure to do so is a fed
eral offense, even if the agent is not paid.
He said registration causes an agent to
lose his effectiveness since any illicit ac
tivities which he participates in come under
the close scrutiny of the U.S. government.
Recourse to courts
He also said all foreign nationals are pro
tected by U.S. law while in the United States
and have recourse to U.S. courts.
Taiwanese students here say informers do
their work for a number of reasons. Some do
it out of loyalty to the party. Others, because
they are on government or party scholar
ships, feel obligated to cooperate with those
paying for their education.
Still others may do it for cash. To students

living abroad who find it difficult to pay
even their basic expenses, the money pro
vides plenty of incentive.
Students here say KMT informers have
had less to report in recent years. It is now
more difficult for Taiwanese students to ob
tain permanent visas in the United States
due to higher unemployment in this coun
try and lower quotas for immigrants al
lowed in from each country.
Since many more are forced to return
home now than before, Taiwanese students
are afraid to do anything which might make
the government hostile toward them. Even
those who do obtain visas still fear for rela
tives living in Taiwan.
No oppression
A letter sponsored by two Taiwanese stu
dents and endorsed by 82 others appeared
in the Feb. 25 Daily denying that political
oppression exists in Taiwan. The last parag
raph of that letter said, "Any person who
may be interested in interviewing each or
any of these individuals is encouraged to do
so."
Five Taiwanese students who signed the
letter responded anonymously to a Daily
questionnaire saying they disagreed with
statements made in the letter. Of the 51 per
sons who responded, 46 said they sup
ported the statements made in the letter.
Two respondents who disagreed with some
statements said they feared reprisals if they
did not sign the letter. The three others who
disagreed with parts of the letter did not say
why they signed it.
The "atmosphere of fear" which pervades
Taiwanese student life here, students say,
profoundly affects their ability to study and
their social lives.
