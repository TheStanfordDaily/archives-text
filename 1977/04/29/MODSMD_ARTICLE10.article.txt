# ERA: It's nothing to 'DeCrow' about
## 
### 
Leaders of the National Or
ganization for Women (NOW)
shocked and embarrassed many
last week with their belligerent
and oftentimes idiotic rhetoric
on the Equal Rights Amend
ment.
Last week, NOW held its con
vention in Detroit. Stung by re
cent legislative defeats for the
ERA, the NOW leaders mounted
the soapbox and flailed away at
ERA opponents who have frus
trated the amendment's ratifica
tion.
Members of NOW are under
standably worried that the prop
osed Equal Rights Amendment
may never become part of the
Constitution. The ERA has fal
tered badly in recent months.
The amendment is three states
short of complete ratification. So
far this year, at least nine states
have refused to approve it. Many
of the unratified states will not
consider it until after the
November 1978 election. When
the legislatures convene in 1979,
there will be little time left be
fore the March 22, 1979 dead
line.
Convention
Feminists are so concerned
that the ERA may fail that the
Detroit convention centered on
planning strategy to insure the
amendment's ratification.

But some of NOW's leaders got
swept away by the frenzy of the
convention and spewed forth
statements that would have been
better left unsaid.
For example, Kathy Hartman,
coordinator of NOW's conven
tion, vented her bile about ERA

opponents:
"People (legislators) in those
states welshed on their prom
ises. Unfortunately, not until
after (the elections in) 1978 can
we show them what happens to
people who welsh on their
promises."
Hartman indulged in sour
grapes, but then added a threat to
"haunt" all ERA opponents:
"Candidates who have the
backing of the United Auto
Workers would never cross the
UAW after they were elected. We
don't have that kind of power
yet, but we hope to."
What is that supposed to
mean? "Sieg heil, mein
fuhreress?" When, in our sup
posedly democratic nation, do
pressure groups like NOW
"own" a candidate they help
elect? Who is she, an important
leader of an influential feminist
group, or a cigar-chomping
Tammany boss?
New strategy
But the strangest statement
was saved for the outgoing head
of NOW, Karen DeCrow. Last
Friday, at a convention address,
she outlined NOW's strategy for
getting the ERA passed.
DeCrow urged President
Jimmy Carter to strip all gov
ernment contracts from states
that have not ratified the ERA
and cut off all federal funds to
those states. Yup, you read cor
rectly. Cut off all federal funds to
the stubborn southern states.
That means stop all food stamp
payments, halt all Social Sec
urity checks to the blind, the el
derly and the crippled, even pull
the plugs in all VA hospital in
tensive care units. Maybe NOW
could smuggle a female terrorist
squad (the girlillas?) into the
South to blow up all the TVA
dams and flood those unrepen
tant states.
If by some crazy fluke Carter
could convince Congress to go

along with such a suggestion, %
the ERA would be doomed. In
tense public outrage would in
sure that anti-ERA legislators
were elected to defeat the ERA,
but good. Lawsuits would erupt
in court to challenge such
heavy-handed, possibly uncon
stitutional federal tactics.
Aid cutoff
Some people might see no
thing wrong with such an aid
cutoff. Well, suppose the leaders
of the Prohibition Party had ad
vocated cutting off all federal
funds to states that would not
approve the prohibition
amendment? Or what if anti- "
abortionists asked the president
to deny funds to any states that
would not pass the proposed
Human Life Amendment? The
federal government would be
given terrible power if it could
railroad constitutional changes
through by starving out dissent
ing states.
Maybe Carter could show the
folly of DeCrow's suggestion by
selective implementation. What
would DeCrow think if Carter
cut off funds for federally
funded abortions and closed®
every southern office of federal
agencies that enforced anti-sex
discrimination laws?
What is saddest of all is that
DeCrow's ERA war whoops
made her look even sillier when
she spoke of reconciliation and a
new society of tenderness and
love in her speech before the
convention. She added that
women should avoid the
"separatism" of the male
dominated world. I think she
meant that women should not be
selfish, arrogant, caustic, ruth
less and manipulative as some^ :
men with power have been at
times.
Stumbling ERA
But DeCrow's words stumble
feebly against her obvious call to
bust a few heads for the ERA.
One might ask then, if the pas
sage of the Equal Rights
Amendment will mean the lib
eration of women to become like
DeCrow and Hartman, how will
that "liberation" benefit any
one?
Or to put it another way: for
many years, women were taught
to be quiet, submissive®'
motherly, compassionate and
longsuffering. What advantage
will women's liberation bring if
it breaks these "oppressive" '
stereotypes and allows, even en- •
courages, women to become ar
rogant, male-like bastards they
are supposedly fighting so hard
not to be?
