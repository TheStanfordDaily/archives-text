# Bug Me"

I noticed in a recent "Bug Me" column that
Pomeone wrote in about water conservation on
campus. The Stanford Energy Office and Tresi ci
der Union are co-sponsoring an energy/
water conservation awareness campaign this quar
ter, which will culminate in the Stanford Energy
Faire May 19-22 at Tresidder.
In the meantime, we have a suggestion box in the
downstairs lobby at Tresidder for people to put
their energy/water saving ideas in. The box is
emptied at least every other day, and Carl Johnson
of the Energy Office is seeing to it that the sugges
tions get delivered to the people who have control
over the problem areas.

Okay folks, here's your chance to remedy any
energy/water wasting conditions you find on cam
pus. If you have any questions, contact Carl
Johnson or Diana Conklin at Tresidder Union.

It has been rumored that the architects that de
signed the Northwestern University Library forgot
to take into account the weight of the books it
would house. Thus the library is slowly sinking
into the landfill upon which it was built.
Is this a reasonable rumor?

Getting to the heart of the matter, I called the
Daily Northwestern. They replied to the question
with an emphatic "NO!" The library was built in
1970, and rumors about it sinking have been cir
culating ever since then.
