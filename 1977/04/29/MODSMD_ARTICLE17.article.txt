# The 						people's car

Serra House residents found the parking lot
had moved inside Wednesday as a handful
of ambitious Serrans moved sophomore
Sally Voss' Volkswagon into the house's

lounge. Voss, a golf team member, was in
Arizona for a tournament at the time. But
Stern Hall employes took a rather dim view of
the project and ordered the car back to its
more orthodox position.
