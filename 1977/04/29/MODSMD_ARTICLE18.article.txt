# Differences remain in Vietnam
## 
### 
Saigon, Vietnam (AP) The Communist
victory two years ago this Saturday brought
about a political reunification of Vietnam for
the first time in 30 years but has failed to
eliminate completely the differences bet
ween the North and South in living stan
dards, economic systems and ways of life.
A 1000-mile trip from Hanoi to Saigon by
road and air disclosed a still Spartan way of
life in the North and a relatively affluent one
in the South. A free-market system still pre
vails in the southern sector with food and
consumer goods more in abundance than in
the North.
Despite the differences in the way north
erners and southerners live, the outward
signs of reunification are there. The red flag
with its gold star centerpiece flies over Ho
Chi Minh City, as the Communists have re
named Saigon.
For nearly 450 miles down Highway 1
from Hanoi, the scene is one of furious activ
ity. The roads are jammed with Soviet- and
Chinese-made trucks, carrying building
materials for reconstruction.
Road rebuilding
Women in conical straw hats and white
leggings crack rocks by hand to rebuild the
bomb-damaged road. Every bridge on the
road was destroyed by U.S. bombing. Some
have been temporarily repaired.
Men and women work until after dark,
bringing in produce, or labor in construction
gangs building canals and dikes. Schools
operate on three shifts a day.
The north has been severely hampered by
a drought and unseasonably cold weather
which has caused a 1.2 million-ton shortfall
in food production, according to sources in
Vietnam.
Rice reportedly is being mixed with corn
in the state-run shops. The rice ration is
about 25 to 30 pounds a month, but it in
creases for factory workers and those who do
manual labor. Rice is also sold on a free mar
ket, when it is available, at about double the

normal price of 60 cents a kilogram (2.2
pounds).
Chinese rice ring
In the south, according to well-informed
sources, the rice trade is still run by a
Chinese rice ring in Saigon's Cholon sector.
It buys from the farmers of the fertile Mekong
Delta at a higher price than the government
offers and sells at inflated black market
prices.
The Communists appear to be moving
slowly to come to grips with the free market
system in the south although a North Viet
namese cadre, a political group leader, pre
dicted it would be eliminated in three to four
years.
But the Communists are working steadily
to increase their political control in the
south. Sources in Vietnam said precinct
committees had been set up in all the major
cities and towns of the south, down to the
street and block level.
The committees are known among south
erners as "street guerrillas" and are respon
sible for everything from running schools to
street sweeping, food distribution, security
and reporting serious crimes and or any
thing smacking of anti-Communist political
agitation.
No all-out effort
So far, sources in Vietnam say, the Com
munists have made no all-out effort to collec
tivize farms in the south or use force to move
people to "New Economic Zones," under
populated and undeveloped areas.
"They have taken the nonviolent option,"
one source said. "They learned their lesson
in 1954-55 when thousands in the north
were killed resisting collectivization."
However, in both north and south the gov
ernment is implementing a huge transfer of
the population to the New Economic Zones.
Saigon's population, estimated at four
million at the end of the war, has been cut by
500,000, and the aim is to reduce it to 1.5
million.

Sources in Hanoi, who have been to the
New Economic Zones, say the government is
able to get people in Saigon to move by refus
ing to give subsidized rice to those without
employment certificates.
Reliable sources estimate that
400,000 people in the south have been set-f
tied into New Economic Zones since the
program began in the fall of 1975. The figure
in the north is not known, although the
Hanoi government has said it plans to move
900,000 people out of the Red River Delta,
and eventually resettle 10 million people by
1980. '
Estimates on the number of South Viet
namese soldiers, officials, politicians,
businessmen and other anti-Communists
who are still under detention in "reeduca
tion camps" varies from 60,000 to 100,000.
A North Vietnamese cadre said the camps
involve a mixture of physical labor and polit
ical indoctrination but no brutality or execu
tions. g
One visitor to a re-education camp saicfl
some of the interns were being given
weekend passes to visit their families.
Massive aid is flowing into the north from
the Soviet Union and East European bloc
nations. On the docks at Haiphong, 60 miles
east of Hanoi, work is continuing to repair
damage caused by U.S. bombing.
But in the south, Saigon bustles almost as
much as it did before the Communist victory
that drove out the Americans and their free
spending Gls. One still can buy American
cigarettes, television sets and stereo equip
ment, but supplies of these seem to be di
minishing. g
People still buzz around on motor
in Saigon, while the bicycle remains the
chief mode of transport in Hanoi.
But southerners are hesitant to talk of the
political situation. Many visitors to Saigon
say they get the impression the South Viet
namese consider themselves second-class
citizens to the northerners.
