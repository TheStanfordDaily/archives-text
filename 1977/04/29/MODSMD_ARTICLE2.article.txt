# Move to reactivate Phi Psi frat begins
## 
### Wil Nixon George Anders 
In an effort to revive the Phi Kappa
«Bsi (Phi Psi) fraternity here, about 20
Bids have been issued to students this
week, according to Allan Amen, one of
two Phi Psi members here.
Amen said he thinks Phi Psi may
have a house on campus for its all-male
fraternity by the 1978-79 school year.
Currently, there is a Phi Psi co-op on
campus. Amen said, though, that the
co-op has "only the Phi Psi name" and
/io ties to the national Phi Psi organiza
tion.
He said he has contacted members of
the co-op about the possibility of join
ing the fraternity, but said most frat
members will be recruited across cam
pus.
'A good core'
Tim Moore, a representative of the
fraternity's national office, said the
group hopes to pledge "10 to 15 guys
which would be a good core to start
with."

Amen, though, said "if we get six or
eight members out of the 20, that's
great."
Moore, Amen and sophomore Mark
Reinecke, the other Phi Psi member
here, conducted a rush for new mem
bers the past two weeks. Rush func
tions included barbecues and a party
in Manzanita Park. About 300 persons
came to the events, Amen said.
Members next year will meet once a
week and try to generate more interest
in the fraternity, Amen said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson said the University would
consider housing for the fraternity
when it had "enough members to fill a
house and perhaps more." He said the
Phi Psi frat would not have a house
next year.
No fight planned
If the University eventually denies
housing to the frat, "we don't plan to
fight anyone," Amen said. "If we
could just have a central place to meet,
that'd be OK."
Amen said he became interested in
Phi Psi because it was "the only frater
nity I knew of that wanted to get back
on campus" and because the new frat
"would not have to conform to set
stereotyped." .
Phi Psi alumni in the local area are
financially supporting the revival ef
fort, said Moore, and will probably end
up donating $5OO to $6OO.
The fraternity has an undisclosed
amount of money in a local bank ac
count remaining from its previous
chapter here. However, none of this
money has been used for the current
Phi Psi campaign.
Begun in 1891, according to Moore,
Phi Psi was the first fraternity here.
Several years ago the Phi Psi house
became a co-op in the University draw
system when membership in the
fraternity had dwindled to eight or
nine members.
The Phi Psi fraternity will hold a
private cocktail bid party tonight.
Amen stressed the advantages of a new
fraternity, saying it is "a smaller, more
personal type set-up."

fraternity, saying it is "a smaller, more
personal type set-up."
In an effort to revive the Phi Kappa
«Bsi (Phi Psi) fraternity here, about 20
Bids have been issued to students this
week, according to Allan Amen, one of
two Phi Psi members here.
Amen said he thinks Phi Psi may
have a house on campus for its all-male
fraternity by the 1978-79 school year.
Currently, there is a Phi Psi co-op on
campus. Amen said, though, that the
co-op has "only the Phi Psi name" and
/io ties to the national Phi Psi organiza
tion.
He said he has contacted members of
the co-op about the possibility of join
ing the fraternity, but said most frat
members will be recruited across cam
pus.
'A good core'
Tim Moore, a representative of the
fraternity's national office, said the
group hopes to pledge "10 to 15 guys
which would be a good core to start
with."

Amen, though, said "if we get six or
eight members out of the 20, that's
great."
Moore, Amen and sophomore Mark
Reinecke, the other Phi Psi member
here, conducted a rush for new mem
bers the past two weeks. Rush func
tions included barbecues and a party
in Manzanita Park. About 300 persons
came to the events, Amen said.
Members next year will meet once a
week and try to generate more interest
in the fraternity, Amen said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson said the University would
consider housing for the fraternity
when it had "enough members to fill a
house and perhaps more." He said the
Phi Psi frat would not have a house
next year.
No fight planned
If the University eventually denies
housing to the frat, "we don't plan to
fight anyone," Amen said. "If we
could just have a central place to meet,
that'd be OK."
Amen said he became interested in
Phi Psi because it was "the only frater
nity I knew of that wanted to get back
on campus" and because the new frat
"would not have to conform to set
stereotyped." .
Phi Psi alumni in the local area are
financially supporting the revival ef
fort, said Moore, and will probably end
up donating $5OO to $6OO.
The fraternity has an undisclosed
amount of money in a local bank ac
count remaining from its previous
chapter here. However, none of this
money has been used for the current
Phi Psi campaign.
Begun in 1891, according to Moore,
Phi Psi was the first fraternity here.
Several years ago the Phi Psi house
became a co-op in the University draw
system when membership in the
fraternity had dwindled to eight or
nine members.
The Phi Psi fraternity will hold a
private cocktail bid party tonight.
Amen stressed the advantages of a new
fraternity, saying it is "a smaller, more
personal type set-up."
