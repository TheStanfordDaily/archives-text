# Big Meet: Up for grabs?
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
"There's no way we can beat
em on paper but that's the
ily place we can't beat them,"
ickcoach Payton Jordan said of
morrow's Big Meet with
ilifornia.
"The only ones who can de
de the meet are the athletes, no
le can win it on paper."
Jordan is right, on paper the
jars are 20- to 30-point favo
rs in the 83rd renewal of the
g Meet. Cal has the upper hand
the distance events, the high
lrdles and all of the field
-ents except the shot put and
ng jump. The sprints and the
lays appear to be a tossup.
"Cal has a lot of depth," Jordan
id, "but if we can get a lot of
;st places we can turn things
ound."

The meet begins at 1:15 p.m.
in Stanford Stadium and tomor
row's winner will take the series
lead, both schools having won
40 meets with two ending in ties.
Early events that may be keys
to the final outcome of the meet
include the javelin, the 500-
meter run and the 400-meter re
lay.
The Bears have three javelin
throwers who have surpassed
215 feet while top Card spear
tosser Ricky Brown has a best of
213-1. Jordan said the event is up
for grabs.
Fans
Cardinal senior Steve Crowley
(3:49.7) and Cal's Andy Clifford
(3:45.4) matchup in a promising
1500. While Clifford has a better
time than Crowley, the veteran
Stanford runner has proven

himself during big competi
tions. Clifford's one advantage
may be that he is one of few run
ners anywhere with his own
rooting section.
The 400-meter relay could be a
dead heat as the Card foursome
of Marvin Holmes, James Lofton,
Gordon Banks and Alan Sheats
has a best of 39.8 while Cal's
quartet of Holden Smith, Wesley
Walker, Paul Wallace and Keith
Taylor have run 39.78.
The mile relay, the last event
of the meet, will be equally
clean. The Cards have a best of
3:10.8, identical to Cal's sea
sonal best. It's a hard race to fi
gure.
Then again, so is the whole
meet. So shred the paper and
head to the stadium.

1500. While Clifford has a better
time than Crowley, the veteran
Stanford runner has proven

himself during big competi
tions. Clifford's one advantage
may be that he is one of few run
ners anywhere with his own
rooting section.
The 400-meter relay could be a
dead heat as the Card foursome
of Marvin Holmes, James Lofton,
Gordon Banks and Alan Sheats
has a best of 39.8 while Cal's
quartet of Holden Smith, Wesley
Walker, Paul Wallace and Keith
Taylor have run 39.78.
The mile relay, the last event
of the meet, will be equally
clean. The Cards have a best of
3:10.8, identical to Cal's sea
sonal best. It's a hard race to fi
gure.
Then again, so is the whole
meet. So shred the paper and
head to the stadium.
