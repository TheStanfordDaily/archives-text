## Women breeze by San Jose State, 7-2 Card netters stick Pepperdine, 8-1 
### 
Stanford's men and women
netters host the University of
San Diego today at 2:30 after
successful matches Wednesday
with Pepperdine and San Jose
State. The University of San
Diego is ranked the No. 4 team in
the NCAA college division and
Coaches Dick Gould and Anne
Hill look for a tough workout to
day.
"Matt (Mitchell) and Bill
(Maze) will not be playing to
day," Gould said. "They have
both been playing so many
matches that I want to give them
a rest for the Berkeley match
Saturday. We've been going
solid for two months."
Gould plans to go with Perry
Wright in the No. 1 spot fol
lowed by Jim Hodges, John Rast,
Lloyd Bourne, Peter Rennert and
either Alejandro Cortes or Steve
Valelly.
"Without Bill and Matt we're
really going to have to work
hard," Gould said. "We don't
know all that much about San
Diego because they have a lot of
foreigners on the team."
Wednesday in the Cards'
match with Pepperdine, Gould
moved frosh Jim Hodges up to
the No. 4 position and sopho
more Rast down to the No. 5
spot. Gould said he is not sure if
the position change is perma
nent at this point.

"I'm trying to look at all the
guys in the second half of the
lineup," Gould explained. Five
of the top seven men will play
tomorrow in singles, however.
Hill was very pleased with No.
1 woman Barb Jordan who re
turned to the lineup Wednesday
after sitting out nearly two
months. Jordan is easing her way
back into collegiate play from a
bout with tendinitis in her
shoulder.
"Barb started a bit nervous,"
Hill said of the sophomore's 6-3,
6-0 performance over San Jose
States' Jennifer Davidson. "Once
she got going she played pretty
well. You could tell she hadn't
played in a while."

Hill had Jordan play singles
for her first match back because
Hill thought the overheads and
net play of doubles competition
could aggravate Jordan's shoul
der. Today, however, Jordan will
team up for doubles with
sophomore Pat Varga.

John McEnroe, the top ranking
high school tennis player in the
United States, has returned his
letter of intent to enroll at Stan
ford University, tennis coach
Dick Gould announced yester
day.
McEnroe, a senior at Trinity
School in Manhattan, N.Y., is
ranked second in the National
18's and recently recorded
straight-set victories over, pro
fessionals Charlie Pasarell and
Bob Lutz in a pro tour stop at
Virginia Beach.
