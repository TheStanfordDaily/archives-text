# Spikers meet Bruins in regionals
## 
### 
Making its first appearance
ever in NCAA regional play, the
Stanford volleyball team takes
on defending national champion
UCLA today in Santa Barbara.
The Bruins are top seeded in the
four-team tournament, followed
by UC-Santa Barbara, Pepper
dine and Stanford.
Last weekend, Stanford won
its second consecutive Northern
California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball league title, defeating
California and Chico State.
Cardinal coach Art Lambert
said Stanford's selection to the
NCAA Regionals is a "giant
step" for Northern California
schools, and for Stanford in par
ticular.
It marks the first time a Nor-
Cal school has been involved in
the regional play.
Stanford met UCLA twice dur
ing the regular season, losing
both matches, yet Lambert feels
his team is better prepared to
give the Bruins a strong chal
lenge.
"The key to our success has
been the defense," says Lambert.
"The entire front line has been
aggressive. The individual per
formance of senior Tom Duralde
has been outstanding."
Starters in addition to Duralde
will be seniors Andy Fishburn
and Rich Rand and freshmen
Rod Fletcher, Tom Grimes and
Kim Lum.
Stanford finished regular sea
son play with an 11-3 record.
