### 
Steve Crandell, a 6-foot-6V2
forward from Santa Barbara
High has signed a national letter
of intent to enroll at Stanford,
basketball coach Dick Dißiaso
announced yesterday.
Crandell averaged 15 points
and 10 rebounds this year. He
shot 49 per cent from the field
and 84 per cent from the line to
earn All-CIF second team hon
ors.
Crandell played for a ball con
trol team which averaged 49
points a game while allowing 4 0.
Santa Barbara was 61-14 in
Crandell's three years on the var
sity.
Dißiaso said Crandell's
"biggest assets are his defensive

ability and his offensive re
bounding. But he's also a fine
outside shooter and ball hand
ler."
Santa Barbara has produced
some fine basketball players, in
cluding Jamal Wilkes of the Gol
den State Warriors and Don Ford
of the Los Angeles Lakers.
In other recruiting news, USC
announced that 6-9 All-NorCal
center Cliff Robinson has signed
a letter of intent to enroll. Robin
son averaged 25 points and 18
rebounds to lead Oakland's
Castlemont High School to a
20-6 record. USC has also signed
CIF 4-A Player of the Year Purvis
Miller of Compton High School.
