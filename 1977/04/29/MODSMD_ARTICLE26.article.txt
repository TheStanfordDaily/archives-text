# Steve Crowley: running out of time
## 
### Jill Lieber 
Steve Crowley is on the verge
of making the big time.
The senior has been touted
this track season as the next
Stanford man to run a sub-four
minute mile. His fastest 1500
meters this spring is 3:49.7
which converts to a 4:08 mile.
Crowley has two problems in
reaching his historic time. No,
physiologically he can break
four minutes. His coaches agree
he hasn't yet reached his poten
tial as a runner. And, yes, he has
the dedication and self
determination to drop seconds
off his existing personal best.
What holds him back is his
weak knees and the fact that only
four meets remain in his "or
ganized" track career.
Hampered by injuries
"Steve has had a series of in
juries that have hampered him in
getting his time down," said
coach Marshall Clark. "We've
had a tough time getting his
speed to where we want it to be.
He hasn't been able to do as
much • distance work as in the
past. It has been frustrating for
him. A lesser athlete would've
dropped the sport."
Due to pounding the pave
ment in overdistance work last
fall, Crowley has had cartilage
and tendon problems in both
knees. An orthopedic surgeon
suggested an operation after he

found a slight tear in his right
knee. But Crowley believes that
after operations knees are never
quite the same and chose to
compromise by going easy on
his distance training this season.
"In the beginning of the year,"
Crowley said, "I'd go out on road
runs and end up walking back
five miles my knees bothered me
so much. I think I was mostly
bummed because I couldn't
hitch a ride back.
"It was frustrating. I thought,
'Hell, what am I going to do
about this?' I knew I had to get in
endurance work so I restruc
tured my road runs into two
workouts a day and ran on grass
instead of hard surfaces."
Pain pinnacle
In February and March the
hardest training months for a
runner the pain was at its
peak. Crowley had to whirlpool
his legs before workout and ice
them after.
"After workouts at night I'd be
sitting studying and just little
slight movements of my knees
would cause pain to shoot into
them," he said. "It felt like a
headache centered in my knee
joint. And the pain would pound
when I laid in bed."
"I've watched Steve ever since
his junior year in high school,"
Clark said. "He has never run the
big times that he is capable of
and that bothers him and me.
He's going on to med school and

I don't know how much time
he'll have to train after this
year."
"In high school I progressed
fairly well," Crowley said. He
was second as a senior in the
California state prep meet. "I had
one of the better times in the Un
ited States my senior year. And it
bothers me because I am won
dering when and how I'm going
to do it (run a sub-four minute
mile). There's a little barrier that
keeps me from dropping down.
"I was thinking the other day
how much I wish I had another
track season to be on a team
and have organized workouts."
Clutch performer
Crowley is an under-pressure
runner with a nose for the tape.
He always wins when he has
to. A lot of mental preparation
goes into the few short minutes
of performance on the track.
Crowley finds his mind drifting
off to the race at odd times dur
ing the week.
"I try not to dwell on the race
too much," he said. "A few days
before I've got a good idea of how
I'm going to run. Beforehand I go
over the kind of pace I want to go
out in and when I'm going to
make a move and kick.
"I have visions of accelerating
and pulling away from everyone
of having a lot left and being
able to use it."

While Crowley.is warming u
before the race, he tries not t
think about his competitior
And what is on his mind at th
starting line?
Tight laces
"I worry about whether c
not my shoe laces are tied tight,
he said. "Constantly throughoc
the race my body is giving m
signs. I can tell in the first la
how I'm going to do. If I feel I ca:
run well I try to fight that and g
on and push myself. That has
lot of psychological power.
"My body dictates changes ii
strategy in a race. If I'm runninj
smooth and easy then I go out 01
pace. You test yourself and th
others during the first laps."
A runner has a psychologica
edge over his opponent by th
way he goes about passinj
others in the race.
"You've got to pass with au
thority," Crowley said. "G<
quickly and move back into th
first lane. When you start to pas
you better be damn sure you can
Sometimes they just go with yoi
and move up. That shows then
they're feeling good and give
them a psychological edge."
Overseas
Crowley has never been temp
ted to give up running. Last yea
he never really got in shape unti
after the track season because o
two quarters of non-traininj
while overseas in Cliveden. Hi
didn't look like the same Stevi
Crowley out on the track th(
same guy who took sixth in th<
Pac-8 the year before.
"I trained pretty
fall quarter whenl was there," hi
said, "but winter I traveled a lot
It was hard to run by myself anc
the sun went down at 4 o'clock,
kept on saying, "Well, I'll star
running tomorrow.'
"I thought about red-shirtin
last year but didn't think i
would be financially feasibl
and I wanted to graduate 01
time. Last season was frustratinj
but I never wanted to quit no
once I got into it and committee
myself."
Crowley has thought abou
quitting in the middle of a raci
—but he never has actually quit
"I've always held it upon my
self to finish a race," he said
"There is a humilating elemen
in dropping out.
"A lot of distance runners ar
stoics. You're willing to g(
through suffering because it'
necessary to get in shape. I ma]
not hold this attitude when I'n
40 but it's a challenge. Then
is personal satisfaction in win
ning races. You build confi
dence in yourself by winning
races or running fast times."

Steve Crowley
Steve Crowley is on the verge
of making the big time.
The senior has been touted
this track season as the next
Stanford man to run a sub-four
minute mile. His fastest 1500
meters this spring is 3:49.7
which converts to a 4:08 mile.
Crowley has two problems in
reaching his historic time. No,
physiologically he can break
four minutes. His coaches agree
he hasn't yet reached his poten
tial as a runner. And, yes, he has
the dedication and self
determination to drop seconds
off his existing personal best.
What holds him back is his
weak knees and the fact that only
four meets remain in his "or
ganized" track career.
Hampered by injuries
"Steve has had a series of in
juries that have hampered him in
getting his time down," said
coach Marshall Clark. "We've
had a tough time getting his
speed to where we want it to be.
He hasn't been able to do as
much • distance work as in the
past. It has been frustrating for
him. A lesser athlete would've
dropped the sport."
Due to pounding the pave
ment in overdistance work last
fall, Crowley has had cartilage
and tendon problems in both
knees. An orthopedic surgeon
suggested an operation after he

found a slight tear in his right
knee. But Crowley believes that
after operations knees are never
quite the same and chose to
compromise by going easy on
his distance training this season.
"In the beginning of the year,"
Crowley said, "I'd go out on road
runs and end up walking back
five miles my knees bothered me
so much. I think I was mostly
bummed because I couldn't
hitch a ride back.
"It was frustrating. I thought,
'Hell, what am I going to do
about this?' I knew I had to get in
endurance work so I restruc
tured my road runs into two
workouts a day and ran on grass
instead of hard surfaces."
Pain pinnacle
In February and March the
hardest training months for a
runner the pain was at its
peak. Crowley had to whirlpool
his legs before workout and ice
them after.
"After workouts at night I'd be
sitting studying and just little
slight movements of my knees
would cause pain to shoot into
them," he said. "It felt like a
headache centered in my knee
joint. And the pain would pound
when I laid in bed."
"I've watched Steve ever since
his junior year in high school,"
Clark said. "He has never run the
big times that he is capable of
and that bothers him and me.
He's going on to med school and

I don't know how much time
he'll have to train after this
year."
"In high school I progressed
fairly well," Crowley said. He
was second as a senior in the
California state prep meet. "I had
one of the better times in the Un
ited States my senior year. And it
bothers me because I am won
dering when and how I'm going
to do it (run a sub-four minute
mile). There's a little barrier that
keeps me from dropping down.
"I was thinking the other day
how much I wish I had another
track season to be on a team
and have organized workouts."
Clutch performer
Crowley is an under-pressure
runner with a nose for the tape.
He always wins when he has
to. A lot of mental preparation
goes into the few short minutes
of performance on the track.
Crowley finds his mind drifting
off to the race at odd times dur
ing the week.
"I try not to dwell on the race
too much," he said. "A few days
before I've got a good idea of how
I'm going to run. Beforehand I go
over the kind of pace I want to go
out in and when I'm going to
make a move and kick.
"I have visions of accelerating
and pulling away from everyone
of having a lot left and being
able to use it."

While Crowley.is warming u
before the race, he tries not t
think about his competitior
And what is on his mind at th
starting line?
Tight laces
"I worry about whether c
not my shoe laces are tied tight,
he said. "Constantly throughoc
the race my body is giving m
signs. I can tell in the first la
how I'm going to do. If I feel I ca:

I don't know how much time
he'll have to train after this
year."
"In high school I progressed
fairly well," Crowley said. He
was second as a senior in the
California state prep meet. "I had
one of the better times in the Un
ited States my senior year. And it
bothers me because I am won

Clutch performer
Crowley is an under-pressure
runner with a nose for the tape.
He always wins when he has
to. A lot of mental preparation
goes into the few short minutes
of performance on the track.
Crowley finds his mind drifting
off to the race at odd times dur
ing the week.
"I try not to dwell on the race
too much," he said. "A few days
before I've got a good idea of how
I'm going to run. Beforehand I go
over the kind of pace I want to go
out in and when I'm going to
make a move and kick.
"I have visions of accelerating
and pulling away from everyone
of having a lot left and being
able to use it."

While Crowley.is warming u
before the race, he tries not t
think about his competitior
And what is on his mind at th
starting line?
Tight laces
"I worry about whether c
not my shoe laces are tied tight,
he said. "Constantly throughoc
the race my body is giving m
signs. I can tell in the first la
how I'm going to do. If I feel I ca:
run well I try to fight that and g
on and push myself. That has
lot of psychological power.
"My body dictates changes ii
strategy in a race. If I'm runninj
smooth and easy then I go out 01
pace. You test yourself and th
others during the first laps."
A runner has a psychologica
edge over his opponent by th
way he goes about passinj
others in the race.

Steve Crowley
Steve Crowley is on the verge
of making the big time.
The senior has been touted
this track season as the next
Stanford man to run a sub-four
minute mile. His fastest 1500
meters this spring is 3:49.7
which converts to a 4:08 mile.
Crowley has two problems in
reaching his historic time. No,
physiologically he can break
four minutes. His coaches agree
he hasn't yet reached his poten
tial as a runner. And, yes, he has
the dedication and self
determination to drop seconds
off his existing personal best.
What holds him back is his
weak knees and the fact that only
four meets remain in his "or
ganized" track career.
Hampered by injuries
"Steve has had a series of in
juries that have hampered him in
getting his time down," said
coach Marshall Clark. "We've
had a tough time getting his
speed to where we want it to be.
He hasn't been able to do as
much • distance work as in the
past. It has been frustrating for
him. A lesser athlete would've
dropped the sport."
Due to pounding the pave
ment in overdistance work last
fall, Crowley has had cartilage
and tendon problems in both
knees. An orthopedic surgeon
suggested an operation after he

found a slight tear in his right
knee. But Crowley believes that
after operations knees are never
quite the same and chose to
compromise by going easy on
his distance training this season.
"In the beginning of the year,"
Crowley said, "I'd go out on road
runs and end up walking back
five miles my knees bothered me
so much. I think I was mostly
bummed because I couldn't
hitch a ride back.
"It was frustrating. I thought,
'Hell, what am I going to do
about this?' I knew I had to get in
endurance work so I restruc
tured my road runs into two
workouts a day and ran on grass
instead of hard surfaces."
Pain pinnacle
In February and March the
hardest training months for a
runner the pain was at its
peak. Crowley had to whirlpool
his legs before workout and ice
them after.
"After workouts at night I'd be
sitting studying and just little
slight movements of my knees
would cause pain to shoot into
them," he said. "It felt like a
headache centered in my knee
joint. And the pain would pound
when I laid in bed."
"I've watched Steve ever since
his junior year in high school,"
Clark said. "He has never run the
big times that he is capable of
