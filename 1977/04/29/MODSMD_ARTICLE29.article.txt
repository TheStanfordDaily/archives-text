.S., Cuba agree on fishing areas
Washington The United States and Cuba
nounced agreement on fishing rights yes
rday, prompting the State Department to
edict that chances are good for improving
lations in other areas.
Asst. Secretary of State Terence Todman
igotiated the fishing agreements during a
ree-day visit to Havana, the first such trip by
1 American diplomat in more than 16 years,
le face-to-face diplomacy was widely viewed
a symbol of an improved climate between
ashington and Havana.
Todman also conferred with Cuba's foreign
inister on a broad range of other issues and
id he sees a possibility for "gradual and con
ant improvement in relations."
The stage for the maritime negotiations was
t eight weeks ago when both countries ex
nded their jurisdiction over fishing rights
)() miles out to sea. Because Cuba is only 90
lies from the U.S. coast, the boundaries over
pped, creating possible jurisdictional con
cts.
The two countries agreed on a new boundary
idway between their respective coasts.
Agreement also was reached permitting
aban fishermen to catch a limited amount of
sh in the American fishing zone outside the
ammon boundary area. No figures were given

on the amount or species of fish Cubans would
be allowed to take from U.S. waters.
Todman said the fishing agreements are
similar to those already in effect with 10 other
countries.
President Jimmy Carter said two weeks ago
that the United States is attempting to deter
mine whether improved relations with Cuba
are possible on a "measured and reciprocal"
basis.
Todman said the Cubans "seem to under
stand" that any move toward reconciliation
cannot be made on the basis of unilateral con
cessions by the United States.
"The Cubans know they could take measures
which would be well received here," Todman
said.
If the Cubans interfere in the internal affairs
of foreign countries, he said, "this obviously
will affect the possibility of normalization."
Oil field closed, leak continues
Stavanger, Norway Fearing a chain
reaction fire that could set the heart of the
North Sea ablaze, the Norwegian government
yesterday ordered its Ekofisk offshore oil field
closed after a "well killer" team failed three
times to cap a six-day-old blowout.
Phillips Petroleum Co., operator of the
runaway well, was reported to be flying in new

equipment for another attempt today at stop
ping the gushing oil and further massive pollu
tion of the sea.
Norwegian officials estimated that the well,
170 miles west of this Norwegian oil center,
had sprayed 6V2 million gallons of crude oil
into the surrounding waters by noon yester
day.
Phillips officials told reporters that a "blow
out preventer," or valve, at the top of the well
had been mistakenly bolted on upside down
last Friday, only hours before the blowout oc
curred.
But the officials insisted that the error did
not cause the blowout. They acknowledged,
however, that it severely impeded the Texan
led troubleshooting team's attempts to seal the
well.
Government reports indicated, meanwhile,
that the pollution problem created by the spil
lage was less than originally feared.
They said that by yesterday morning the size
of the slick being fed by the Bravo well dwin
dled through evaporation and the action of the
waves to about 270 square miles, half of what it
was Wednesday.
The government's decision to close the well
came after pressure from left-wing members of
parliament in Oslo. The order temporarily shut
down 30 wells in the Ekofisk Alpha and Bravo
zones'. The wells produced 9.8 million barrels
69 million gallons of oil in March.
Watergate lawyers to claim bias
Washington Attorneys for the convicted
Watergate cover-up defendants hope to receive
permission today to tell the Supreme Court
why a news report about the court requires the
justices to reverse the convictions.
The lawyers for former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and ex-White House aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman stand ready to
tell the justices that the new report, if accurate,
is an unprecedented leak from the court's
closed deliberations and has made it impossi
ble for them to get fair treatment of the appeals.
Ultimately; the unusual circumstances of the

case could determine whether Mitchell and
Haldeman ever go to prison for crimes a jury in
1976 determined they had committed.
The news reports that surfaced last week
said the court had voted to deny the appeals of
all three officials of farmer President Richard
Nixon's administration. Chief Justice Warren
Burger has declined to comment on the re
ports.
Leaks about who discussed what during
those sessions are rare, and last week's report,
if accurate, is believed to be the first time a
court decision was made public before being
officially announced.
If they get the green light, lawyers are ex
pected to attempt to show that the court was
tainted by the news report.
Handicapped regulation signed
Washington After weeks of demonstra
tions by handicapped persons, Health, Educa
tion and Welfare Sec. Joseph Califano Jr.
signed a far-reaching regulation yesterday that
is designed to give equal educational and
employment opportunities to the handicap
ped.
The regulation implements a section of the
1973 Rehabilitation Act that bars recipients of
federal funds from discriminating against the
estimated 35 million handicapped citizens in
the United States.
It affects federally supported schools, col
leges, health and welfare institutions. The
HEW regulation will serve as a model for simi
lar measures that now must be written by all
other government agencies.
London institute criticizes Carter
London In a report critical of Carter ad
ministration policies, an authoritative research
institute said today that the Soviet Union is
steadily building and modernizing its military
power while the West wavers.
The International Institute for Strategic
Studies said in its annual survey that President
Jimmy Carter's disarmament policies
"smacked of obsolete concepts" and his

human rights statements had destroyed the
cordiality and trust in East-West relations.
The institute's study of the world military
balance also said that in contrast to backing
and filling i n the West, the Soviet arms buildup
has gone ahead and "in almost every area
seems to outpace the intensity and scope of
Western military programs."

President Jimmy Carter said two weeks ago
that the United States is attempting to deter

Todman said the Cubans "seem to under

Oil field closed, leak continues
Stavanger, Norway Fearing a chain
reaction fire that could set the heart of the
North Sea ablaze, the Norwegian government
yesterday ordered its Ekofisk offshore oil field
closed after a "well killer" team failed three
times to cap a six-day-old blowout.
Phillips Petroleum Co., operator of the
runaway well, was reported to be flying in new

equipment for another attempt today at stop
ping the gushing oil and further massive pollu
tion of the sea.
Norwegian officials estimated that the well,
170 miles west of this Norwegian oil center,
had sprayed 6V2 million gallons of crude oil
into the surrounding waters by noon yester
day.
Phillips officials told reporters that a "blow
out preventer," or valve, at the top of the well
had been mistakenly bolted on upside down
last Friday, only hours before the blowout oc
curred.
But the officials insisted that the error did
not cause the blowout. They acknowledged,
however, that it severely impeded the Texan
led troubleshooting team's attempts to seal the
well.
Government reports indicated, meanwhile,
that the pollution problem created by the spil
lage was less than originally feared.
They said that by yesterday morning the size
of the slick being fed by the Bravo well dwin
dled through evaporation and the action of the
waves to about 270 square miles, half of what it
was Wednesday.
The government's decision to close the well
came after pressure from left-wing members of
parliament in Oslo. The order temporarily shut
down 30 wells in the Ekofisk Alpha and Bravo
zones'. The wells produced 9.8 million barrels
69 million gallons of oil in March.
Watergate lawyers to claim bias
Washington Attorneys for the convicted
Watergate cover-up defendants hope to receive
permission today to tell the Supreme Court
why a news report about the court requires the
justices to reverse the convictions.
The lawyers for former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and ex-White House aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman stand ready to
tell the justices that the new report, if accurate,
is an unprecedented leak from the court's
closed deliberations and has made it impossi
ble for them to get fair treatment of the appeals.
Ultimately; the unusual circumstances of the

case could determine whether Mitchell and
Haldeman ever go to prison for crimes a jury in
1976 determined they had committed.
The news reports that surfaced last week
said the court had voted to deny the appeals of
all three officials of farmer President Richard
Nixon's administration. Chief Justice Warren
Burger has declined to comment on the re
ports.
Leaks about who discussed what during
those sessions are rare, and last week's report,
if accurate, is believed to be the first time a
court decision was made public before being
officially announced.
If they get the green light, lawyers are ex
pected to attempt to show that the court was
tainted by the news report.
Handicapped regulation signed
Washington After weeks of demonstra

signed a far-reaching regulation yesterday that
is designed to give equal educational and
employment opportunities to the handicap

The regulation implements a section of the
1973 Rehabilitation Act that bars recipients of
federal funds from discriminating against the
estimated 35 million handicapped citizens in
the United States.
It affects federally supported schools, col
leges, health and welfare institutions. The
HEW regulation will serve as a model for simi

other government agencies.
London institute criticizes Carter
London In a report critical of Carter ad

institute said today that the Soviet Union is

The International Institute for Strategic

The institute's study of the world military

has gone ahead and "in almost every area

igotiated the fishing agreements during a
ree-day visit to Havana, the first such trip by
1 American diplomat in more than 16 years,

a symbol of an improved climate between

Todman also conferred with Cuba's foreign

ant improvement in relations."
The stage for the maritime negotiations was
t eight weeks ago when both countries ex
nded their jurisdiction over fishing rights
)() miles out to sea. Because Cuba is only 90
lies from the U.S. coast, the boundaries over
pped, creating possible jurisdictional con
cts.
The two countries agreed on a new boundary
idway between their respective coasts.
Agreement also was reached permitting
aban fishermen to catch a limited amount of
sh in the American fishing zone outside the
ammon boundary area. No figures were given

on the amount or species of fish Cubans would
be allowed to take from U.S. waters.
Todman said the fishing agreements are
similar to those already in effect with 10 other
countries.
President Jimmy Carter said two weeks ago
that the United States is attempting to deter
mine whether improved relations with Cuba
are possible on a "measured and reciprocal"
basis.
Todman said the Cubans "seem to under
stand" that any move toward reconciliation
cannot be made on the basis of unilateral con
cessions by the United States.
"The Cubans know they could take measures
which would be well received here," Todman
said.
If the Cubans interfere in the internal affairs
of foreign countries, he said, "this obviously
will affect the possibility of normalization."
Oil field closed, leak continues
Stavanger, Norway Fearing a chain
reaction fire that could set the heart of the
North Sea ablaze, the Norwegian government
yesterday ordered its Ekofisk offshore oil field
closed after a "well killer" team failed three
times to cap a six-day-old blowout.
Phillips Petroleum Co., operator of the
runaway well, was reported to be flying in new

equipment for another attempt today at stop
ping the gushing oil and further massive pollu
tion of the sea.
Norwegian officials estimated that the well,
170 miles west of this Norwegian oil center,
had sprayed 6V2 million gallons of crude oil
into the surrounding waters by noon yester
day.
Phillips officials told reporters that a "blow
out preventer," or valve, at the top of the well
had been mistakenly bolted on upside down
last Friday, only hours before the blowout oc
curred.
But the officials insisted that the error did
not cause the blowout. They acknowledged,
however, that it severely impeded the Texan
led troubleshooting team's attempts to seal the
well.
Government reports indicated, meanwhile,
that the pollution problem created by the spil
lage was less than originally feared.
They said that by yesterday morning the size
of the slick being fed by the Bravo well dwin
dled through evaporation and the action of the
waves to about 270 square miles, half of what it
was Wednesday.
The government's decision to close the well
came after pressure from left-wing members of
parliament in Oslo. The order temporarily shut
down 30 wells in the Ekofisk Alpha and Bravo
zones'. The wells produced 9.8 million barrels
69 million gallons of oil in March.
Watergate lawyers to claim bias
Washington Attorneys for the convicted
Watergate cover-up defendants hope to receive
permission today to tell the Supreme Court
why a news report about the court requires the
justices to reverse the convictions.
The lawyers for former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and ex-White House aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman stand ready to
tell the justices that the new report, if accurate,
is an unprecedented leak from the court's
closed deliberations and has made it impossi
ble for them to get fair treatment of the appeals.
Ultimately; the unusual circumstances of the

case could determine whether Mitchell and
Haldeman ever go to prison for crimes a jury in
1976 determined they had committed.
The news reports that surfaced last week
said the court had voted to deny the appeals of
all three officials of farmer President Richard
Nixon's administration. Chief Justice Warren
Burger has declined to comment on the re
ports.
Leaks about who discussed what during
those sessions are rare, and last week's report,
if accurate, is believed to be the first time a
court decision was made public before being
officially announced.
If they get the green light, lawyers are ex
pected to attempt to show that the court was
tainted by the news report.
Handicapped regulation signed
Washington After weeks of demonstra
tions by handicapped persons, Health, Educa
tion and Welfare Sec. Joseph Califano Jr.
signed a far-reaching regulation yesterday that
is designed to give equal educational and
employment opportunities to the handicap
ped.
The regulation implements a section of the
1973 Rehabilitation Act that bars recipients of
federal funds from discriminating against the
estimated 35 million handicapped citizens in
the United States.
It affects federally supported schools, col
leges, health and welfare institutions. The
HEW regulation will serve as a model for simi
lar measures that now must be written by all
other government agencies.
London institute criticizes Carter
London In a report critical of Carter ad
ministration policies, an authoritative research
institute said today that the Soviet Union is
steadily building and modernizing its military
power while the West wavers.
The International Institute for Strategic
Studies said in its annual survey that President
Jimmy Carter's disarmament policies
"smacked of obsolete concepts" and his

human rights statements had destroyed the
cordiality and trust in East-West relations.
The institute's study of the world military
balance also said that in contrast to backing
and filling i n the West, the Soviet arms buildup
has gone ahead and "in almost every area
seems to outpace the intensity and scope of
Western military programs."
