KZSU elections
KZSU last night announced the results of the
election for next year's station officers. New
officers are: station manager, Jon Morris; prog
ram director, Mike Lopez; business manager,
Denise O'Leary, and chief engineer, Ron
Kwang.
Officers were elected by the KZSU staff. All
new terms will begin on June 12.
High court case denied
A United Stanford Employee's petition to
the California State Supreme Court for a hear
ing to review campus parking fees has been
denied by the court.
This will leave standing a unanimous deci
sion of the California Court of Appeals which
called the current fee structure "reasonable
and orderly."
Correction
The Radical Film Series presentation of Cool
Hand Luke will be this evening at 7 and 9:30,
not-Saturday as reported in yesterday's
Cinemascope.
