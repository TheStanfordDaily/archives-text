# Childcare program facility approved
## 
### William Sposato 
After an exhaustive search, the ad
hoc Committee on Childcare has de
cided to build a new facility for the
Stanford New Afterschool Program
(SNAP), according to committee
chairperson Sandy Chapek.
SNAP, which until last year was lo
cated at the Lucille Nixon Elementary
School, handles children from ages 5
to 9 after they are released from school
each day. Chapek said there is a real
need for this type of care, especially
among student parents.
The facility will be constructed as an
addition to the Escondido Village

Center and will cost approximately
$70,000. Chapek said this cost is much
lower than if a new building were re
quired.
The addition will be funded by a
loan from the Escondido Village Hous
ing reserve fund, but Chapek said fun
draising efforts will reduce the amount
of money to be borrowed from this
fund. The ASSU Senate has donated
$2OO to the cause.
Roger Kairns of the Facilities Plan
ning Office, who is in charge of the
construction, said he hopes the addi
tion will be completed by September.
He also said the University will use

the same architect who designed the
village center, and Kairns hopes actual
design work will start shortly.
Chapek said the new location for
SNAP will be an excellent one because
many children will be going to school
across the street at Escondido Elemen
tary School.
SNAP has been without any facility
for all of this year after it was displaced
from Nixon School. Chapek said the
Committee on Childcare looked into
all available facilities before deciding
to build a new center.
None of the empty buildings could
have met licensing requirements for
childcare center, according to Chapek.
Chapek stated the new center would
cost parents between $BO and $lOO per
month, depending on how much they
are able to pay in donations.
Donations will be used to reduce the
initial debt to the Escondido Village
Housing reserve fund, and thus reduce
the rent SNAP will have to pay.
The Council on Childcare, which
will consist of students, staff members
and faculty wives, has been estab
lished to handle fundraising, publicity
and coordination between childcare
facilities.
At the present time, there are three
other childcare centers which serve
the University community. They are
the Bing Nursery School, run by the
Psychology Department, the Chil
dren's Center of the Stanford Com
munity and the Escondido Village
Nursery.
Chapek said that none of these cen
ters meet the need of everyday care for
the five to nine age group.
The new SNAP center will accom
modate 40 children, which according
to Chapek is not enough, but she said,
"40 is better than none."

and coordination between childcare
facilities.
At the present time, there are three
other childcare centers which serve
the University community. They are
the Bing Nursery School, run by the
Psychology Department, the Chil
dren's Center of the Stanford Com
munity and the Escondido Village
Nursery.
Chapek said that none of these cen
ters meet the need of everyday care for
the five to nine age group.
The new SNAP center will accom
modate 40 children, which according
to Chapek is not enough, but she said,
"40 is better than none."
After an exhaustive search, the ad
hoc Committee on Childcare has de
cided to build a new facility for the
Stanford New Afterschool Program
(SNAP), according to committee
chairperson Sandy Chapek.
SNAP, which until last year was lo
cated at the Lucille Nixon Elementary
School, handles children from ages 5
to 9 after they are released from school
each day. Chapek said there is a real
need for this type of care, especially
among student parents.
The facility will be constructed as an
addition to the Escondido Village

Center and will cost approximately
$70,000. Chapek said this cost is much
lower than if a new building were re
quired.
The addition will be funded by a
loan from the Escondido Village Hous
ing reserve fund, but Chapek said fun
draising efforts will reduce the amount
of money to be borrowed from this
fund. The ASSU Senate has donated
$2OO to the cause.
Roger Kairns of the Facilities Plan
ning Office, who is in charge of the
construction, said he hopes the addi
tion will be completed by September.
He also said the University will use

the same architect who designed the
village center, and Kairns hopes actual
design work will start shortly.
Chapek said the new location for
SNAP will be an excellent one because
many children will be going to school
across the street at Escondido Elemen
tary School.
SNAP has been without any facility
for all of this year after it was displaced
from Nixon School. Chapek said the
Committee on Childcare looked into
all available facilities before deciding
to build a new center.
None of the empty buildings could
have met licensing requirements for
childcare center, according to Chapek.
Chapek stated the new center would
cost parents between $BO and $lOO per
month, depending on how much they
are able to pay in donations.
Donations will be used to reduce the
initial debt to the Escondido Village
Housing reserve fund, and thus reduce
the rent SNAP will have to pay.
The Council on Childcare, which
will consist of students, staff members
and faculty wives, has been estab
lished to handle fundraising, publicity
and coordination between childcare
facilities.
At the present time, there are three
