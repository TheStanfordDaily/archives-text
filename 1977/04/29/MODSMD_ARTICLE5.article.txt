# Fac Sen ponders salary disclosure
## 
### Bill Sing 
A preliminary report recommending that University fa
culty salaries be disclosed through a series of graphs was
discussed by the Faculty Senate yesterday.
Also, discussion on the faculty's role in defining a "sub
stantial consensus" on the University's moral respon
sibilities in South African corporate investments con
cluded yesterday without any action taken by the senate.
On the issue of faculty salary disclosure, the senate was
presented a report by the Ad Hoc Task Force on Disclosure
of Academic Salaries which recommended the use of
graphs displaying the median, lower quartile and upper
quartile salary levels of faculty in various schools and de
partments, plotted against years in rank in the professoriate.
"The idea behind greater salary disclosure," says the
report, "is to give individual faculty, and the administra
tion they deal with, a reasonable idea of how their salary
compares with others."
Such graphs, says the report, would serve as "a basis for
informed salary decisions based on merit"
The University's policy is to base salaries on merit and
not on any seniority system.
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornsbusch, a member of the
task force, said such a scheme "would make for better bar
gaining" among faculty with their department heads and

deans, and would put more pressure on administrative of
fices to justify their judgments of faculty merit.
While such graphs would be informative, they would not
violate the confidentiality of individual faculty members'
salaries, added Dornbusch.
The task force will report back to the senate at some future
date.
On the issue of University investment responsibility, As
soc. English Prof. Ronald Rebholz criticized the Universi
ty's Commission on Investment Responsibility for its "pas
sive" role in failing to educate and listen to the faculty and
the rest of the University community.
The commission had recommended earlier this month
that the University abstain on shareholder proxies to limit
or end U.S. corporate invertment in South Africa.
"The professoriate is a vital constituency of the Univer
sity," said Assoc. Political Science Prof. David Abernethy.
"When the University acts as a single institution —as it
must when considering how to vote stock shares represent
ing its partial ownership of other private sector
institutions—the faculty have a right and responsibility to
know what their University is doing and to have at least
advisory inputs into the process of making decisions."
Discussions on the investment responsibility issue will
probably continue at the next senate meeting May 12.
