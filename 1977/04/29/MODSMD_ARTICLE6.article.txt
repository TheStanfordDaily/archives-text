# AIM leader vows to fight extradition

leader Dennis Banks said in an inter
view here yesterday he would "abide
by the laws of California" if the state
supreme court orders Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. to extradite him but he
would not necessarily return to South
Dakota.
He said unless the airplane trans
porting him flies directly to South
Dakota, he would have "attorneys
armed with writs of habeas corpus" at
every possible intermediary stop bet
ween California and South Dakota.
Law Prof. John Kaplan explained the
proposed scheme would force courts
in the state where the plane landed to
decide whether Banks should be ex
tradited.
Kaplan called the plan "absurdly
hypothetical because if they have any
brains they'll fly him direct."
'Fight extradition'
"My goal is to fight extradition,"
Banks said after addressing about 50
persons in Meyer Forum Room yester
day morning.
The state Third District Court of Ap
peals ordered Brown Monday to extra
dite Banks who jumped bail in South
Dakota in 1975 to avoid sentencing on
an assault charge.

Banks said yesterday his lawyers
"have been in contact with him
(Brown) and he's going to appeal to the
California Supreme Court."
Banks spoke here as part of a sym
posium yesterday on Native Ameri
cans and the Administration of Justice
sponsored by the Stanford American
Indian Organization.
During his talk, Banks said the ad
ministration of justice for native
Americans is unbalanced. Referring to
Lady Justice, he said, "I would be
blindfolded too if I knew the kind of
justice going on. She is ashamed of the
administration of justice."
Banks advocated improving condi
tions of native Americans by institut
ing a native American judicial review
committee and a special native Ameri
can Social Security fund.
He said the current Social Security
system is unfair because the average
life expectancy for a native American
is 44, while it is 70 for an average
white.

He said employers and employes
should put money in a special pension
fund for native Americans instead of in
the Social Security system.
'Happily ever after'
"A special native American Social
Security fund should be established so
we can retire at 40 years and we can
live happily ever after, for the next four
or five years," Banks said.
The purpose of a judicial review
committee would be "to examine
policies that exist in five Plains
states."
He quoted figures from Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and
South Dakota where the percentage of
prison inmates who are native Ameri
cans is much greater than the percen
tage of native Americans in the state
populations.
Banks noted, for example, that out of
Minnesota's population of 3.8 million,
.4 per cent were native Americans.
However, in the state penitentiary 12
per cent of the 1600 inmates were na
tive Americans.
He also mentioned Montana had a
population 3.7 per cent of which
was native American while the state
prison population was 33 per cent na
tive American.
Emphasizing the historical mis
treatment of native Americans, Banks
traced legislation which he said was
"aimed at destroying native American
societies, aimed at destroying the re
ligion of native American people."
He said native Americans are treated
more severely than whites when
charged with the same crimes. He
cited a case which he said concerned
two identical murders. Bail for the na
tive American was set at $lOO,OOO. The
white's bail was $5OOO.
Banks criticized the policy that a
white man cannot be extradited if he
commits a crime'on a reservation.
Banks said two warrants are out for
South Dakota Atty. Gen. William
Janklow in connection with a rape of a
teenage girl on Rosebud Indian Reser
vation. Banks said the warrants cannot
be served outside the reservation.
Banks said he has been called many
names. Pounding his chest, he said,
"I just introduce myself as a savage. It's
hard to be a savage."
