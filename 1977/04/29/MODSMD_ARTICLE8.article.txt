## Trivia Bowl, Fiddler, Stonehill

Trivia Bowl, Fiddler
I wish to express my ambiva
lent thanks to Tim Ferguson for
his left-handed compliment re
garding the first Stanford Trivia
Bowl (Daily, April 26). By coupl
ing his praise for the Trivia Bowl
with an attack on last week's
Career Planning and Placement
Center demonstration Ferguson
has completely confused what
serves only as a diversion with
that which truly "enriches" this
community.
Far from being an "untem
pered uplift," I found that most
of the Trivia Bowl participants
attacked the contest with the
same "grim seriousness" with
which they enter Meyer.
Nevertheless, the Trivia Bowl
coaxed hundreds out of
libraries to enjoy the competi
tion. What troubles me is the
vivid contrast between the large
turn-outs for such entertaining
productions as the Trivia Bowl
and Fiddler on the Roof and the
marked apathy of today's "more
reasoned" students concerning
the important issues here.
Ferguson believes the
"bookishness" of students de
monstrates some new and en
lightened moral force.
I beg to differ with the reactio
nary conservatism of Ferguson.
Students who protest the
policies of this university march
not to impose their ethics on
others, but rather to encourage
the silent majority to at least
think about the problems at
hand. I agree that few moral
judgments are shared by all, but I
fear that many of those library
addicts of the majority have not
paused to make any judgment.
There is a time for fun and
games, and there is a time for
some sober consideration of the
meaning of the actions of the
university and ourselves. The
Trivia Bowl is an example of the
former. The university's active
military recruiting policy and
tacit consent to South African
racism through its investment
policy are examples of the latter.
These are the real issues that de
serve to draw us out of the lib
raries.

Schaeffer, Stonehill
This week Stanford is blessed
by the advent, on celluloid, of
Dr. Francis Schaeffer, presuma
bly a doctor of divinity; and, in
the flesh of Randy Stonehill,
"gifted guitarist and incisive
songwriter." One might safely
infer from the Ã¼biquitous posters
for Schaeffer's film series and
the Stonehill concert that these
events constitute attempts to
Chistianize the viewer/listener.
One cannot, however, discern
from the posters and leaflets just
who is sponsoring these events.
For example, who or what is
"Inter-Varsity," the group so
generously enabling us to trace
"The Rise and Decline of West
ern Thought and Culture"?
If Stanford's "Christians" de
sire to further tighten their
stranglehold on truth, they
might well acknowledge the true
nature and intent of their shaky
efforts to entrap audiences for
their message.
If the gays and Republicans
are coming out in the open, why
not the "Christians"?

Malaise of Spring
I am writing this letter in re
sponse to Andy Baker's response
to Tim Ferguson's article enti
tled "Malaise of Stanford's
Spring." Although Baker
criticizes the article for its
ideological position I found it
full of "good times" and I am in
favor of every student having a
silver lining even the ones who
aren't married to Meyer Library.
Baker also neglects to point
out that the paragraphs concern
ing the Trivia Bowl and Fiddler
on the Roof were both well writ
ten and intellectually stimulat
ing.
It should be clarified that
Baker is not representing the of
ficial Stanford Lovers of Un
usual Trivia (S.L.U.T.) position
in his letter. The Executive
Committee of our organization
held in a special closed meeting
and decided that I was to be the

S.L.U.T. spokesman on this
issue of the Ferguson letter.
Therefore, in the name of the
S.L.U.T. I submit the following:
For 10 points each define the
following concepts found in the
Ferguson and Baker letters.
1. BOOKISHNESS
2. LAUDABLE PROPOSITION
3. REACTIONARY CONSER
VATISM
4. B.S. (BREEZY SPECULA
TION)

Jewish Center fire
Speaking for the Hillel Foun
dation at Stanford, I would like
to call attention to the Daily's
non-coverage of the arson at the
Jewish Community Center in
Palo Alto. I was amazed to learn
that this news event was not
given one word of ink in Stan
ford's paper.
On Easter Sunday, a fire was
set at the Jewish Community
Center, causing heavy damage to
the facilities. This deserved

newspaper coverage; arson is in
trinsically newsworthy in a
small town like Palo Alto, if only
because it doesn't happen very
often. The Palo Alto Times re
ported it on page one the next
day, and devoted front page
space in later days as later de
velopments unfolded.
Coverage of this event was
particularly important to Stan
ford. The Jewish Community
Center is the coordinator of
every kind of Jewish activity
which involves Midpeninsula
Jewry.
For at least 1200 Jewish Stan
ford students, hundreds of
Jewish faculty and staff, and
other concerned citizens, the
fate of this Center is of vital sig
nificance. Yet the Daily chose to
ignore these real concerns en
tirely.
Third, the fire had a potential
religious meaning. It was un
known for days whether the fire
was malicious mischief, a ran
dom arson, an act of anti-Semitic
violence, or something still dif
ferent. Although the evidence
now points toward a lack of
anti-Semitic motive, it appeared
possible initially that this was
such an act.
Clearly such conduct would
be a major news item; the recent
incidents involving Congrega
tion B'nai Emunah and the Nazi
Party in San Francisco were co
vered by all news services, in
cluding the Daily. I feel the Daily
was lax in its journalistic duty by
ignoring the potential implica
tions of this arson.
Considering the nature of
much of the Daily's content, I
cannot accept the argument that
space was inadequate to allow
coverage of the incident. News
events should still have priority
over less urgent and important
matters.
I do not know whether the fai
lure of the Daily to cover the
Jewish Community Center story
was due to oversight, willful
neglect, or just indifference to
the concerns of the Stanford
Jewish communtiy.
I hope the Daily will recognize
the need for corrective action in
the future, and accord to the
Jewish community the press
coverage it deserves.
