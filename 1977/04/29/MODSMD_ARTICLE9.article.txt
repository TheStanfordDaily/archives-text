# Farmworker's week
## 
### David Catanzarite 
May 1 marks the start of Na
tional Farmworker Week; at this
time, I'd like to call attention to
the progress of the farmworker
movement that has grown up in
this country in the past 10 years.
Due largely to the efforts of Cesar
Chavez and the United Farm
Workers union (UFW), one of the
most dispossessed groups in
society, namely the migrant
workers, have taken a significant
first step in their struggle to
achieve the dignity and rights af
forded most other working
people in the United States.
They have built a powerful,
historical labor movement virtu
ally from scratch against united
opposition from some of the
world's largest corporations
(growers such as Tenaco and
Union Pacific). The key to their
success lies in their firm com
mitment to two important
philosophies non-violent
coercion through boycott and

civil disobedience, and an em
phasis on interracial coopera
tion.
California growers have
employed violent strikebreakers
and brutal local police, as in The
Grapes of Wrath, to intimidate
workers and keep them from or
ganizing; they imported first
Filipinos and, more recently,
dispossessed Arabs and Por
tuguese; which they sought to
segregate and bring into compet
ition on racial lines against Mex
ican and black migrant workers.
Thanks to the vision and faith
of farmworkers within the
movement, neither grower tactic
was allowed to succeed.
Through boycott and civil
disobedience, the UFW has suc
ceeded in publicizing their
cause, thereby fostering tre
mendous support among prog
ressives the world over.
We in the cities need the
farmworkers for their hard work.

For this reason May 1 has been
designated as Farmworker In
terdependence Day. On this day,
farmworkers and their friends all
over the state will celebrate the
interdependence of races, urba
nites and ruralites, laborers, and
non-laborers.
It is sponsored by the United
Farm Workers, the Santa Clara
County Council of Churches,
and various community organi
zations, and will give recogni
tion to all who have helped built
the union the farmworkers in
the fields and their supporters in
the cities.
On behalf of the farmworkers,
we of the Stanford United Farm
Workers Support Committee
wish to invite our friends in the
community to help us celebrate.
