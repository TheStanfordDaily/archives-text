It was obvious that Dan was a born leader as evidenced by his being the
co-captain of the 1963 Stanford track team as well as holding the Stanford
long jump record until this past year. He was also active in the Sigma Chi
social fraternity. Dan is an Elder in the Morman Church and is active in the
YMCA.
Dan was fortunate — it only took him two years to find the Quiet Company.
Perhaps you can be more fortunate by beginning your career right out of
college as I did. To see if a Northwestern Mutual career would make sense to
