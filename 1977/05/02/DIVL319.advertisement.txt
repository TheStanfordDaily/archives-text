"Deliriously
erotic."*
:;: "This fantasy, as enchanting as it is enchanted, will fill
appreciative readers with the same joy in youth amidst
surging nature A Midsummer Night's Dream still weaves.
"Seamus Cullen has created a world similar in some
ways to that of Tolkien: it possesses that certain shim
mer. Yet he has done Tolkien one better hv making his
world deliriously erotic.
"The tale is both classic and fresh, the story of a quest
beginning 'once upon a time, many years hence' when
our world has been reduced to atomized ashes.
"But to give more than a hint of Astra and Flondrix
would be to diminish its magic" —Houston Chronicle
