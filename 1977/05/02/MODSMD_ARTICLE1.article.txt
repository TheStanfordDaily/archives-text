# 'Daily' case appealed to high court
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The City of Palo Alto has petitioned
the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
decision of two lower courts that a 1971
search of the Daily offices by Palo Alto
Police was unconstitutional.
The city argues the decisions will
severely curtail the ability of police
and other investigative agencies to
gather evidence against suspects.
In his 1972 decision, Federal District
Judge Robert Peckham ruled that the
search violated both the First and
Fourth Amendments, and on Feb. 2,
1977, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld that decision.
Peckham said police should use the
"least drastic means" available when
seeking evidence from nonsuspects.
The police obtained a search war
rant giving the Daily no advance warn
ing, rather than a subpoena, a less dras
tic option the Daily could have attemp
ted to quash.
The case, Stanford Daily vs.
Zurcher, is a result of a raid on Daily
offices by four Palo Alto policemen on
April 12, 1971. Equipped with a search
warrant, police went through files,
desks and wastebaskets looking for
photographic evidence to use against
participants in an April 9, 1971 riot at
the Stanford hospital.
Warrant-free sanctuaries
In their petition, the city's attorneys
argue that the decision "sets the stage
for virtually warrant-free sanctuaries.
Thus, the premises of a friend,
sweetheart, or relative can safely con
ceal evidence or the ill-gotten gains of
the criminal."
Peckham said the search violated
the Fourth Amendment protection
against "unreasonable search and sei
zure." He warned law enforcement
agencies to be especially careful when
First Amendment interests are in
volved. In such cases he said, "the
subpoena should always be preferred
to a search warrant."
The search of the Daily offices was
the first known time in U.S. history
police used a warrant to search a news
organization for evidence, according
to Jerome Falk Jr. who argued the Dai
ly's case before the appeals court.
Since that search several radio sta
tions and newspapers have experi
enced similar raids.
Falk said it will probably be October
before the high court decides whether
it will hear the case and Falk added he
thinks the court will refuse. Daily
lawyers have 23 days left to file a rebut
tal to the city's petition.
