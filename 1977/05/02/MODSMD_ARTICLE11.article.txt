Collective guilt?
The Chabad Synagogue arson to
which the Rev. Wendy Smith referred
recently (Daily, April 18) was a de
plorable, uncivilized act. Neverthe
less, her vague invocation of history to
support an insinuation that Christians
were responsible was a flimsy excuse
indeed for her attempt at perpetrating
a collective guilt on us for the act.
If the situation were as bad as
she insinuates, her "shame" would not
be sufficient to exonerate us—despite
her position as acting dean of the
chapel. Is she trying to stir up another
religious war? Or does she simply
overestimate her atonement capabil
ity?
Perhaps Smith, not fully aware of
the implications of her letter, is merely
trying to drum up business. We Christ
ians, however, already fall far short of
the perfection to which we are
called—as any honest examination of
conscience will plainly reveal to us
individually—and it is therefore not
necessary for her to manufacture sins
for us.
Perhaps her province as a Christian
minister should be simply to remind
us—notwithstanding advancement of
the "social gospel"—that we still have
individual consciences which require
frequent individual examination in
light of our Christian calling.

The march against the Marine Corps
and the recruiter from that racist and
generally intolerant organization was
a great way to show everyone how the
majority of the campus feels.
It's about time, we, the morally
righteous of this country, start to ex
press strong and blind intolerance for
the intolerance of the Ku Klux Klan
(KKK) and any group that supports it
(like the marines).
If other demonstrations like that one
follow, it will only be a matter of time
until we rid ourselves of all the dis
eased minds that are racist, sexist and
generally intolerant of persons diffe
rent from themselves.
It's clear to me that the only solution
is the one the demonstrators seem to
advocate:ousting racist groups from
our campus, eventually (and hope
fully) from this country as well.
Of course, to accomplish such a task
we could (conceivably) work in two
ways. The idealistic but totally un

realistic and impractical method
would involve trying to convince the
pubLic that racism is against the com
munity interest, that it breeds hate,
that it is unjustified in the first place
and other theoretically good reasons.
Not only would this take too long (if
not forever), but people would recog
nize that even liberals were allowing
groups such as the KKK, the Nazis and
the marines to exist; and the public
would, of course, conclude that
everyone approves of these highly in
tolerant organizations.
In short, if we tolerate even the exis
tence of these prejudiced people, they
will gain credibility; once that hap
pens, we are lost.
The second method is the one I ad
vocate and the one the demonstrators
seemed to advocate at the rally. The
essential idea being that we intimidate
the enemy as well as actively partici
pate in its removal from society.
This includes depriving it of allots
rights as a so-called "minority." (After
all, KKK members are seldom black,

chicano, Asian American or female —
certainly KKK parasites don't count as
a "minority.")
Kicking the marines off campus is
only a trivial beginning. We must kick
all intolerant groups out of towns,
cities, states and finally out of the
country where they can do us no harm.
It may seem that such a radical view
is morally wrong, even in the eyes of
the radicals themselves. This is true.
Nevertheless, troubled times de
mand that we discard al 1 these abstract
goals. Remember, we are dealing with
fanatical, irrational, closed-minded
people who are helplessly in the grip
of intolerance and prejudice. We can't
deal rationally with irrational people,
can we now?
To get rid of the marines (and equi-
morally decadent groups) is
obviously the best policy.
The problem at hand, however, is
not that most people approve of KKK
ideals (or lack thereof). Quite the op
posite, I would say most people de
spise such racist values. The problem

is that a good number of these people
who agree with us in the abstract are
extremely skeptical about our practi
cal methods (i.e. ousting unwanted
groups). They have many objections
that I can't get around; probably no
body could. Sure, replies have been
given, but they're not very convincing,
even to me. But what do little things
like moral objections mean—
especially if we ignore them?
The challenge then, as I see it, is to
convince the skeptics that our
methods are absolutely necessary so
that alien groups such as the KKK can
be wiped off the scene rather than
examined critically. Only in this way
can we create a society that is tolerant
of all views and at peace with itself!
Hopefully, you see through thegiant
moral gaps in the above testimony.
Hopefully, you will think about the
issues.
Hopefully, you will do something.

The march against the Marine Corps
and the recruiter from that racist and
generally intolerant organization was
a great way to show everyone how the
majority of the campus feels.
It's about time, we, the morally
righteous of this country, start to ex
press strong and blind intolerance for
the intolerance of the Ku Klux Klan
(KKK) and any group that supports it
(like the marines).
If other demonstrations like that one
follow, it will only be a matter of time
until we rid ourselves of all the dis
eased minds that are racist, sexist and
generally intolerant of persons diffe
rent from themselves.
It's clear to me that the only solution
is the one the demonstrators seem to
advocate:ousting racist groups from
our campus, eventually (and hope
fully) from this country as well.
Of course, to accomplish such a task
we could (conceivably) work in two
ways. The idealistic but totally un

realistic and impractical method
would involve trying to convince the
pubLic that racism is against the com
munity interest, that it breeds hate,
that it is unjustified in the first place
and other theoretically good reasons.
Not only would this take too long (if
not forever), but people would recog
nize that even liberals were allowing
groups such as the KKK, the Nazis and
the marines to exist; and the public
would, of course, conclude that
everyone approves of these highly in
tolerant organizations.
In short, if we tolerate even the exis
tence of these prejudiced people, they
will gain credibility; once that hap
pens, we are lost.
The second method is the one I ad
vocate and the one the demonstrators
seemed to advocate at the rally. The
essential idea being that we intimidate
the enemy as well as actively partici
pate in its removal from society.
This includes depriving it of allots
rights as a so-called "minority." (After
all, KKK members are seldom black,

chicano, Asian American or female —
certainly KKK parasites don't count as
a "minority.")
Kicking the marines off campus is
only a trivial beginning. We must kick
all intolerant groups out of towns,
cities, states and finally out of the
country where they can do us no harm.
It may seem that such a radical view
is morally wrong, even in the eyes of
the radicals themselves. This is true.
Nevertheless, troubled times de
mand that we discard al 1 these abstract
goals. Remember, we are dealing with
fanatical, irrational, closed-minded
people who are helplessly in the grip
of intolerance and prejudice. We can't
deal rationally with irrational people,
can we now?
To get rid of the marines (and equi-
morally decadent groups) is
obviously the best policy.
The problem at hand, however, is
not that most people approve of KKK
ideals (or lack thereof). Quite the op
posite, I would say most people de
spise such racist values. The problem

is that a good number of these people
who agree with us in the abstract are
extremely skeptical about our practi
cal methods (i.e. ousting unwanted
groups). They have many objections
that I can't get around; probably no
body could. Sure, replies have been
given, but they're not very convincing,
even to me. But what do little things
like moral objections mean—
especially if we ignore them?
The challenge then, as I see it, is to
convince the skeptics that our
methods are absolutely necessary so
that alien groups such as the KKK can
be wiped off the scene rather than
examined critically. Only in this way
can we create a society that is tolerant
of all views and at peace with itself!
Hopefully, you see through thegiant
moral gaps in the above testimony.
Hopefully, you will think about the
issues.
Hopefully, you will do something.

Collective guilt?
The Chabad Synagogue arson to
which the Rev. Wendy Smith referred
recently (Daily, April 18) was a de
plorable, uncivilized act. Neverthe
less, her vague invocation of history to
support an insinuation that Christians
were responsible was a flimsy excuse
indeed for her attempt at perpetrating
a collective guilt on us for the act.
If the situation were as bad as
she insinuates, her "shame" would not
be sufficient to exonerate us—despite
her position as acting dean of the
chapel. Is she trying to stir up another
religious war? Or does she simply
overestimate her atonement capabil
ity?
Perhaps Smith, not fully aware of
the implications of her letter, is merely
trying to drum up business. We Christ
ians, however, already fall far short of
the perfection to which we are
called—as any honest examination of
conscience will plainly reveal to us
individually—and it is therefore not
necessary for her to manufacture sins
for us.
Perhaps her province as a Christian
minister should be simply to remind
us—notwithstanding advancement of
the "social gospel"—that we still have
individual consciences which require
frequent individual examination in
light of our Christian calling.

and other theoretically good reasons.
Not only would this take too long (if
not forever), but people would recog
nize that even liberals were allowing
groups such as the KKK, the Nazis and
the marines to exist; and the public
would, of course, conclude that
everyone approves of these highly in
tolerant organizations.
In short, if we tolerate even the exis
tence of these prejudiced people, they
will gain credibility; once that hap
pens, we are lost.
The second method is the one I ad
vocate and the one the demonstrators
seemed to advocate at the rally. The
essential idea being that we intimidate
the enemy as well as actively partici
pate in its removal from society.
This includes depriving it of allots
rights as a so-called "minority." (After
all, KKK members are seldom black,

chicano, Asian American or female —
certainly KKK parasites don't count as
a "minority.")
Kicking the marines off campus is
only a trivial beginning. We must kick
all intolerant groups out of towns,
cities, states and finally out of the
country where they can do us no harm.
It may seem that such a radical view
is morally wrong, even in the eyes of
the radicals themselves. This is true.
Nevertheless, troubled times de
mand that we discard al 1 these abstract
goals. Remember, we are dealing with
fanatical, irrational, closed-minded
people who are helplessly in the grip
of intolerance and prejudice. We can't
deal rationally with irrational people,
can we now?
To get rid of the marines (and equi-
morally decadent groups) is
obviously the best policy.
The problem at hand, however, is
not that most people approve of KKK
ideals (or lack thereof). Quite the op
posite, I would say most people de
spise such racist values. The problem

is that a good number of these people
who agree with us in the abstract are
extremely skeptical about our practi
cal methods (i.e. ousting unwanted
groups). They have many objections
that I can't get around; probably no
body could. Sure, replies have been
given, but they're not very convincing,
even to me. But what do little things
like moral objections mean—
especially if we ignore them?
The challenge then, as I see it, is to
convince the skeptics that our
methods are absolutely necessary so
that alien groups such as the KKK can
be wiped off the scene rather than
examined critically. Only in this way
can we create a society that is tolerant
of all views and at peace with itself!
Hopefully, you see through thegiant
moral gaps in the above testimony.
Hopefully, you will think about the
issues.
Hopefully, you will do something.
