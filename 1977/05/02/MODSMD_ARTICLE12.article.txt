# Law school's Watergate

The recent letter from the Stanford
Chicano Law Students Association to
the Stanford Law School Alumni
raises questions which go far beyond
allegations of unjust treatment of
minorities there. The fundamental
question can perhaps best be summed
up as follows:
Was the appointment of a new dean
this year merely one part of an attempt
to cover up a mini-Watergate scandal
at the Stanford Law School?
Regardless of one's political persua
sion or personal view of minority ad
missions programs, the public, in pur
suit of the ideal of full disclosure, is
entitled to the answers to certain ques
tions:
—How many qualified minority
students have applied to Stanford
since the inception of the minority
program and have been turned down?
—What criteria have been used to
determine who gets admitted?
—Why is it that of 35 full-time faculty
members only two belong to a minor
ity group?
—Has the law school fully disclosed
the qualifications of those minority fa-

culty who do apply for positions?
—Is there any substance to the rumor
that for a number of years certain fa
culty members engaged in grade dis
crimination against minority students
by identifying their exam numbers and
then lowering grades?
—Was a former law school official
involved in or did he sanction these
activities?
—Did a former law school official
allow the use of faculty time (i.e. at the
University's expense) for the pursuit of
social activism on a broad scale?
—Did a former law school official
allow certain powerful interest groups
at the law school to admit and hire
students and faculty of similar
backgrounds and political
persuasions—all to the detriment of
other minorities?
Whatever one's view of minority
admissions programs and the gover
nance of the law school, the public and
contributors to the University are enti
tled to answers to these questions.
With a bit of investigation, the
answers are easy to find.
For example, on the matter of grade

discrimination by certain faculty
against certain minorities, it would be
a simple matter, without revealing
names, to average the grades of minor
ity students for each faculty member
for a certain period, say 1970 to 1975.
Then those averages could be com
pared with non-minority averages for
those same professors, and special at
tention could be paid to those few pro
fessors whose minority student grade
averages were "atypical."
In short, it is clear that discrimina
tion is taking place at the law school.
The enrollment figures—3o minority
students in 1973 versus 15 in 1976 —
speak for themselves. The only ques
tion is whether this "discrimination"
is based on considerations of "quality"
and "standards of excellence" alone.
And, by the way, whose subjective
"standards of excellence" is the law
school using anyway? Let there be
light and truth—let the law school
fully disclose the events of the past
half decade!
