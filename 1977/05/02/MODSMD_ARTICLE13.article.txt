My wife gave me a badger hair
shaving brush and an English
porcelain shaving mug. The mug
is like a small pitcher, with a
soap dish with a hole in it built
in on top. How am I supposed to
use this thing? What goes in the
pitcher, and what goes in the
dish on top?
-A.S.
Not having one of these things
myself, I called A 1 Ramirez at the
San Jose Barber College. He said
that the pitcher is for water, and
that the dish is for the shaving
soap,.
One takes the brush and dips it

in the water. Then, it is twirled
on the soap until a lather is
formed. Apply the lather and
one is ready to shave (a razor
would also be helpful). The
brush can be re-dipped and
twirled for more lather.
When the shave is finished,
simply pour out the water and
rinse the brush. Then it's ready
for the next time.

Why are the Coffeehouse and
The Store always so hot and
stuffy even on cool breezy days?
Why are the huge banks of lights
left on in The Store even on

bright sunny afternoons adding
to the already sufficient heat?
Why can't students of engineer
ing and energy-efficient build
ing design place ventilating funs
of crank-type windows in the
upper positions of the large glass
walls of the Coffeehouse or The
Store?
-M.L.
Tresidder Union Director Dan
Williams is the man with the
answers. According to Williams,
it has been hot inside recently
because the chiller in the base
ment has been broken for more
than a month. Tresidder officials
have been trying to fix it, and
hopefully, it will be fixed in a
couple of weeks.
As for the lights, Williams said
it was an "excellent question."
Means are continually being
sought for reducing the electric
bill, so he was glad it was "called
to our attention." He said it
would be corrected. Since the
beginning of the year, the elec
tric bill has been reduced by 20
per cent.
The problem with the Cof
feehouse is one of design. It was
originally intended to be a table
tennis room so the air system
was not designed to handle a cof
feehouse.
This September, Tresidder
will switch over to the Universi
ty's chilled water system. This
will cause fewer problems than
using the basement chiller.

Being a pre-rned, I don't often
get time to myself for anything
but study; however, last Sunday
(April 24), 1 saw the Flick's pre
sentation of The Front. I was
wondering if former Sen. Joseph
McCarthy is still alive.

he is dead.

wondering if former Sen. Joseph
McCarthy is still alive.
-A curious pre-med
out of his field
According to the Daily news
office (which is fairly reliable),
he is dead.

My wife gave me a badger hair
shaving brush and an English
porcelain shaving mug. The mug
is like a small pitcher, with a
soap dish with a hole in it built
in on top. How am I supposed to
use this thing? What goes in the
pitcher, and what goes in the
dish on top?
-A.S.
Not having one of these things
myself, I called A 1 Ramirez at the
San Jose Barber College. He said
that the pitcher is for water, and
that the dish is for the shaving
soap,.
One takes the brush and dips it

in the water. Then, it is twirled
on the soap until a lather is
formed. Apply the lather and
one is ready to shave (a razor
would also be helpful). The
brush can be re-dipped and
twirled for more lather.
When the shave is finished,
simply pour out the water and
rinse the brush. Then it's ready
for the next time.

Why are the Coffeehouse and
The Store always so hot and
stuffy even on cool breezy days?
Why are the huge banks of lights
left on in The Store even on

bright sunny afternoons adding
to the already sufficient heat?
Why can't students of engineer
ing and energy-efficient build
ing design place ventilating funs
of crank-type windows in the
upper positions of the large glass
walls of the Coffeehouse or The
Store?

Tresidder Union Director Dan
Williams is the man with the
answers. According to Williams,
it has been hot inside recently
because the chiller in the base
ment has been broken for more
than a month. Tresidder officials
have been trying to fix it, and
hopefully, it will be fixed in a
couple of weeks.
As for the lights, Williams said
it was an "excellent question."
Means are continually being
sought for reducing the electric
bill, so he was glad it was "called
to our attention." He said it
would be corrected. Since the
beginning of the year, the elec
tric bill has been reduced by 20
per cent.
The problem with the Cof
feehouse is one of design. It was
originally intended to be a table
tennis room so the air system
was not designed to handle a cof
feehouse.
This September, Tresidder
will switch over to the Universi
ty's chilled water system. This
will cause fewer problems than
using the basement chiller.

Being a pre-rned, I don't often
get time to myself for anything
but study; however, last Sunday
(April 24), 1 saw the Flick's pre
sentation of The Front. I was
wondering if former Sen. Joseph
