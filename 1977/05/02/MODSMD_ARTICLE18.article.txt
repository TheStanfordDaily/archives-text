# Sorority life at Berkeley
## Does sorority stereotype fit?

Sorority girl. The words con
jure up numerous images. Metal
lic blondes leaning possessively
on the arms of smiling frat men.
White gloves. Formal dances.
All-night hen parties.
You may be seeing sorority
houses bringing up the rear of
frat row. The University is de
liberating whether to lift the ban
on sororities, which dates back
to 1944.
Realizing our stereotypes
might be a bit out-dated (a mere
35 years), we decided to journey
across the bay to Berkeley to find
out what sorority life is really
like.
Some things haven't changed,
we found, "it's sort of funny
when you walk down streets,
you can pick out the bunches of
sorority girls. They wear a sort of
uniform," said one resident of
Cheney, a women's dorm at Ber
keley.
"Individually, you can meet

and really like a sorority girl, but
when they get together, they get
really cliquish," said Barbie Jen
sen, a co-op member. "As a rule,
sorority girls are cute. It seems
like the stereotype is true.
Clothes and dressing are really
important in a sorority."
"Lots of the Greeks are snobs
and are up here to get married.
You walk into a 'mick' course
and there are enough Greeks to
have at least two winter for
mals," remarked one dorm resi
dent.
"The stereotype gets you very
upset sometimes. We deal a lot
with the problem of trying to
change our image," said Kim
Scbulze, who formerly worked
with Pan Hellenic Council, the
national organization coordinat
ing sororities.
According to Schulze, each
house has a different character as
does each sorority member.
Sorority members said they felt
it was unfair to talk about the
typical sorority girl.

"You say Greek, and they
(non-Greeks) say, 'Oh, you're a
sorority bitch,'" commented
Alison Herlichy, Alpha Phi
member.
The girls choose to pledge a
sorority for myriad reasons. So
cial life. Living conditions. Sec
urity. Many consider sororities
to be an oasis in comparison to
the often impersonal atmos
phere of Berkeley dorms.
Sororities were founded on
the principles of sisterhood,
friendship, academic achieve
ment, leadership and commun
ity services, according to Ann
Hawley, assistant dean of stu
dents. She said the university be
lieves the Greek system is part of
the university education. "We
feel students learn how to self
govern themselves," she
explained.
'Hokey'
"1 know the idea of sisterhood
sounds kind of hokey, but there
really is a bond that holds us to
gether," commented Schulze.
According to jan Hart, Alpha
Delt member, "the best thing is
the social connections. Any
thing else you can get in any
other living situation."
"I like the house because 1
meet people I'd never have met
in a dorm," said Schulze. "But
you've got to 'put out' to do it."
'Phony and depressing'
"I feel some pressure to meet
guys," commented Blair, "but
the party situations are some
times phony and depressing."
"One of the problems is that
after a while, social life gets
stagnant. Greek parties facilitate
meeting the same people over
and over again," commented
Schulze.
"Frat parties are kind of
grossâ€”like meat markets," said
Blair. "They're okay if you're re
ally drunk."
Although Hawley claims "all
houses stand for exactly the
same thing," individual
sororities have nevertheless ac
quired certain reputations.
Members of Theta Delta Chi
fraternity have fondly dubbed
Alpha Phi girls as "all for free."
The Alpha Gamma Delts are "all
God's dogs." And the Tri Delts
are characterized as "the con

vent on the hill."
One of the advantages of
sororities is their beautiful
houses. Living rooms are buf
fed mahogany with chrysan
themums tastefully arranged.
Men are about the only thing
missing.
Alpha Delta Phis allow male
visitors only in the commons
area on the first floor. "The idea
is not having to worry about
guys being around when you're
in your underwear," explained
Schulze.
The most often-criticized as
pect of sororities is rush, the an
nual process of selecting new
members. Both rushers and
rushees agree the selection pro
cess can be a dehumanizing and
traumatic experience.
During sorority rush last fall,
the 13 sororities on campus were
visited by 385 girls.
Decision on looks
"I didn't see what they could
judge people on in such a short
period of time. Obviously what
they base their decision on is
your looks." Jensen mimicked,
'"Do you have a boyfriend? Oh,
does he play football?' The
whole idea seems to be wrong."
Blair, who just experienced
her first rush, said, "Rush is
weird. You meet girls in a super
formal environment. Everyone
(in the sorority) gets picky and
irritable about choosing the new
girls."
One dorm resident was bitter
about sororities because of the
pressure put on the girls rush
ing. "You should see the girls
when they come back. They get
dropped from houses of people
they thought liked them. They
start wondering what's wrong
with them."
"I have more dignity than to
parade around like I have a
number on my back and in two
weeks maybe number 29 will be
called back," commented
another Cheney resident.
Self-abuse
Sturts agreed that rush "prob
ably isn't the nicest way. But you
figure that people put them
selves through it," she
explained.
But of the 385 women who
rushed last fall, 280 pledged a
house. Hawley explained that
the remaining girls were not
necessarily rejected, but may
have opted for other living situa
tions. According to Hawley,
there were roughly enough
spaces in houses to accommo
date all the women wanting to
live in a house. Currently nine
per cent, or 917 Berkeley women
are members of sororities.
Whether the stereotype is true
or not. there is definitely a
stigma attached to being a Greek.
Alpha Phi member Susan
McDaniels said she is often re
luctant to tell people she lives in
a sorority. "When people ask me
where I live, I tell them that I live
up by the stadium," she com
mented.
