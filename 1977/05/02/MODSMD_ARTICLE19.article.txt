### Sara Lessley 
Campus reactions to the pos
sibility of sororities returning to
Stanford range from positive to
negative.
Jordan Schwartz, IFC presi
dent, said he thinks the return of
sororities would be a "very heal
thy thing in many respects.
Sororities offer additional resi
dential and social opportunities
for Stanford women."
A resident of Roth Flouse ex
pressed the opposite viewpoint,
however. She said she sees no
need for sororities today. She
feels they are "totally irrelevant"
and "superfluous." She added
that Roth an all female house,
has many activities, like
sororities, but that it doesn't
have the social pressures a soror
ity would have.
Kim Howland, a freshman at
Toyon, favors sororities. "Men
have the option of living in
fraternities . . . women should

have the same option. Women
have a lot of offer each other,"
she added.
Tim Ferguson, Chairman of
the Committee on Student Ser
vices Subcommittee on Resi
dences, said he thought
"sororities would be a healthy
thing." One objection to the re
turn of sororities is that frater
nities and sororities might in
teract exclusively with each
other. Ferguson said he didn't
think this would happen. He
said, "The temperament of this
campus is different ... it
wouldn't lend to a USC (exclu
sive) type of fraternity-sorority
system."
Subjective selection is an im
portant option, said Patrick
Flynn, Academic Organization
Board chairman. "The life style
you get when members choose
each other is important as long
as it is not the only possible liv
ing situation," remarked Flynn.
