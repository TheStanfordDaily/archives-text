## FEATURES Sorority ban did not result from Hoover Tower suicide 
### Sara Lessley 
Almost every Stanford student has heard the
myth about the coeds who committed suicide be
cause they weren't bid by a sorority. However, that
story is untrue, according to Fred Glover, secretary
to the University.
Actually, sororities here were discontinued on
student recommendation, Glover said. In 1943, the
13 sponsors (RAs) of Roble presented a statement
to the Pan Hellenic Council.
Their statement, co-signed by 200 non-sorority
women, raised some questions about the sorority
system. These sponsors, six of whqm were sorority
members, seven of whom were hall women, ar
gued that the disharmony between sorority and
non-sorority women on campus was serious.
After 1933 when the University substantially
increased its enrollment of women, the number of
sororities and their housing capacity remained the
same. As a result, the demand for sorority housing
exceeded the capacity.
Especially during the war years, when women
students far outnumbered the men, only one of five
women could join a sorority because of the hous
ing limitations. The Committee of Academic Af
fairs which investigated the problem said, "during
rush there is an emotional tension which affects
prospective pledges and sorority women."
The committee added that "the women students
are so tense and tired that their college work suf
fers unmistakably."

A 1943 Daily editorial asserted sororities "no
longer have a place on campus." The article said
sororities were undemocratic, had a misplaced
emphasis on social, not academic ends and made
women dependent on the group.
Pro-sorority groups argued that they "had pro
vided advantages to Stanford women that were not
obtainable except through sororities." They said
one benefit of small living groups who elected to
live together was that they primarily govern them
selves, which promotes group responsibility and
develops leadership.
The 1943 Daily editorial added that another
positive aspect of the sororities was that they
helped members to "develop socially and academ
ically."
The committee considered the issues raised by
Stanford women for more than a year. Hearings
were held, representing all sides. Finally the
committee, in a report to the Board of Trustees,
concluded that the "dual system of housing and
social program has caused serious disunity among
Stanford women." The committee said, "other re
medies including changes in rushing rules, will
not eliminate the fundamental causes of the disun
ity...; therefore we recommend that there be a dis
continuance of sororities." The committee's report
was adopted by the board on April 20, 1944.
Thirty-four years later, students are working to
ward the repeal of the sorority ban. Because of Title
IX, the administration is now forced to consider
removing the ban.

Are Berkeley students right? Can you really pick out a sorority girl? Not in this picture anyway. Both

Those who drink together stay together?
Are Berkeley students right? Can you really pick out a sorority girl? Not in this picture anyway. Both
are Stanford women.
Almost every Stanford student has heard the
myth about the coeds who committed suicide be
cause they weren't bid by a sorority. However, that
story is untrue, according to Fred Glover, secretary
to the University.
Actually, sororities here were discontinued on
student recommendation, Glover said. In 1943, the
13 sponsors (RAs) of Roble presented a statement
to the Pan Hellenic Council.
Their statement, co-signed by 200 non-sorority
women, raised some questions about the sorority
system. These sponsors, six of whqm were sorority
members, seven of whom were hall women, ar
gued that the disharmony between sorority and
non-sorority women on campus was serious.
After 1933 when the University substantially
increased its enrollment of women, the number of
sororities and their housing capacity remained the
same. As a result, the demand for sorority housing
exceeded the capacity.
Especially during the war years, when women
students far outnumbered the men, only one of five
women could join a sorority because of the hous
ing limitations. The Committee of Academic Af
fairs which investigated the problem said, "during
rush there is an emotional tension which affects
prospective pledges and sorority women."
The committee added that "the women students
are so tense and tired that their college work suf
fers unmistakably."

A 1943 Daily editorial asserted sororities "no
longer have a place on campus." The article said
sororities were undemocratic, had a misplaced
emphasis on social, not academic ends and made
women dependent on the group.
Pro-sorority groups argued that they "had pro
vided advantages to Stanford women that were not
obtainable except through sororities." They said
one benefit of small living groups who elected to
live together was that they primarily govern them
selves, which promotes group responsibility and
develops leadership.
The 1943 Daily editorial added that another
positive aspect of the sororities was that they
helped members to "develop socially and academ
ically."
The committee considered the issues raised by
Stanford women for more than a year. Hearings
were held, representing all sides. Finally the
committee, in a report to the Board of Trustees,
concluded that the "dual system of housing and
social program has caused serious disunity among
Stanford women." The committee said, "other re
medies including changes in rushing rules, will
not eliminate the fundamental causes of the disun
ity...; therefore we recommend that there be a dis
continuance of sororities." The committee's report
was adopted by the board on April 20, 1944.
Thirty-four years later, students are working to
ward the repeal of the sorority ban. Because of Title
IX, the administration is now forced to consider
removing the ban.
