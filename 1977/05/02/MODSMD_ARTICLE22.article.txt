# Albritton, Lofton sparkle
## Track team close in Big Meet 
### Stacy Geiken 
The Stanford Cardinals lost to
the California Bears in the 83rd
annual Big Meet at Stanford
Saturday, as expected.
Then came the unexpected.
—The Cards set three out of
the four new meet records.
—Card weightman Terry Al
britton put the shot 67-feet-9V4
for a new meet and stadium re
cord. eclipsing the five-year-old
mark by over a foot.
—The Card track team fought
man for man and point for point
to come within a mere 14 points
of beating the tough squad from
Berkeley.
The score of 70-84 was only a
superficial indication of how
close the Cards actually came.
Stanford superstar James Lof
ton started the meet off right by
breaking a 27-year-old meet re
cord with a 26-foot-IV4 clearance
in the long jump.
Within five minutes of Lof

ton's winning jump, Albritton
exploded with his 67-9'/i shot
put.
Arms in the air, both athletes
acknowledged the crowd's ap
proval, as the Cards took the
lead, 10-8.
The Cards kept the lead
through the steeplechase with a
fine second and third place
finish by Bill Gail and Bill
Haldeman in 9:19.2 and 9:26.8,
respectively.
Then the battle began.
Excellent hand-offs in the 400
meter relay by sprinters, Marvin
Holmes, Lofton and Gordon
Banks gave the Cards' anchor
man Alan Sheats a slight lead
over the Bear foursome. But Cal
sprinter Keith Taylor narrowed
the lead, finishing in a virtual
dead heat with Sheats.
Bear coach Erv Hunt shook his
head.saying, "too tight, too
tight," after the Bears were given
the nod, both teams were timed

in 40.1.
Lofton and Sheats kept the
pressure on with a one-two
finish in the 400 meter run. Lof
ton's time of 46.6 gave him his
second meet record of the day,
while Sheats finished in 46.7.
Lofton's 400 meter time was
all the more impressive consid
ering the gusty winds that
picked up the back stretch dur
ing the race.
"It (the wind) almost knocked
me down," Lofton said, "so I
shortened my stride and tried to
sprint off the turn."
The wind, competition and
school work proved to be too
much for 1500 meter-man Steve
Crowley, as Bear stand-out Andy
Clifford outkicked the Card by 10
meters.
"I knew he was going to come
by," Crowley said, "but I did not
know when."
Clifford made a quick surge
with 200 meters remaining to

open up a 10 meter gap before
Crowley had a chance to re
spond. Clifford won in 3:47.5 to
Crowley's 3:49.4.
The previous week had been
particularly tough on Crowley as
he had to prepare for the Medical
College Admissions Tests
(MCAT) being held over the
weekend.
Bionic Bears
The Cal track team wore
t-shirts with the words "Bionic
Bears" written on the back.
However, in the 5000-meter run
the Bears were anything but
bionic.
Bear thinclad Brad Duffy, who
has probably never led the early
stages of a race in his collegiate
career, found himself in an un
familiar position Saturday after
noon.
After the first 10 yards, Duffy
found himself in the lead. Con
fused, Duffy slowed and looked
back at Card runners, Jeff Parietti
and Roy Kissin.
Duffy looked like a fish out of
water as he weaved and
staggered his way through the
first six laps. Thanks to a seventh
lap surge by Kissin, the pace
picked up considerably.
Tired of the wait-and-kick tac
tics that Duffy had used on him
earlier in the season, Parietti said
that his plan was "just to follow"
Duffy until the final 200 meters.
Despite Duffy's bewilderment,
he still managed to outkick
Parietti, 14:49 to 14:49.4.

the four new meet records.
—Card weightman Terry Al
britton put the shot 67-feet-9V4
for a new meet and stadium re
cord. eclipsing the five-year-old
mark by over a foot.
—The Card track team fought
man for man and point for point
to come within a mere 14 points
of beating the tough squad from
Berkeley.
The score of 70-84 was only a
superficial indication of how
close the Cards actually came.
Stanford superstar James Lof
ton started the meet off right by
breaking a 27-year-old meet re
cord with a 26-foot-IV4 clearance
in the long jump.
Within five minutes of Lof

ton's winning jump, Albritton
exploded with his 67-9'/i shot
put.
Arms in the air, both athletes
acknowledged the crowd's ap
proval, as the Cards took the
lead, 10-8.
The Cards kept the lead
through the steeplechase with a
fine second and third place
finish by Bill Gail and Bill
Haldeman in 9:19.2 and 9:26.8,
respectively.
Then the battle began.
Excellent hand-offs in the 400
meter relay by sprinters, Marvin
Holmes, Lofton and Gordon
Banks gave the Cards' anchor
man Alan Sheats a slight lead
over the Bear foursome. But Cal
sprinter Keith Taylor narrowed
the lead, finishing in a virtual
dead heat with Sheats.
Bear coach Erv Hunt shook his
head.saying, "too tight, too
tight," after the Bears were given
the nod, both teams were timed

in 40.1.
Lofton and Sheats kept the
pressure on with a one-two
finish in the 400 meter run. Lof
ton's time of 46.6 gave him his
second meet record of the day,
while Sheats finished in 46.7.
Lofton's 400 meter time was
all the more impressive consid
ering the gusty winds that
picked up the back stretch dur
ing the race.
"It (the wind) almost knocked
me down," Lofton said, "so I
shortened my stride and tried to
sprint off the turn."
The wind, competition and
school work proved to be too
much for 1500 meter-man Steve
Crowley, as Bear stand-out Andy
Clifford outkicked the Card by 10
meters.
"I knew he was going to come
by," Crowley said, "but I did not
know when."
Clifford made a quick surge
with 200 meters remaining to

open up a 10 meter gap before
Crowley had a chance to re
spond. Clifford won in 3:47.5 to
Crowley's 3:49.4.
The previous week had been
particularly tough on Crowley as
he had to prepare for the Medical
College Admissions Tests
(MCAT) being held over the
weekend.
Bionic Bears
The Cal track team wore
t-shirts with the words "Bionic
Bears" written on the back.
However, in the 5000-meter run
the Bears were anything but
bionic.
Bear thinclad Brad Duffy, who
has probably never led the early
stages of a race in his collegiate
career, found himself in an un
familiar position Saturday after
noon.
After the first 10 yards, Duffy
found himself in the lead. Con
fused, Duffy slowed and looked
back at Card runners, Jeff Parietti
and Roy Kissin.
Duffy looked like a fish out of
water as he weaved and
staggered his way through the
first six laps. Thanks to a seventh
lap surge by Kissin, the pace
picked up considerably.
Tired of the wait-and-kick tac
tics that Duffy had used on him
earlier in the season, Parietti said
that his plan was "just to follow"
Duffy until the final 200 meters.
Despite Duffy's bewilderment,
he still managed to outkick
Parietti, 14:49 to 14:49.4.
