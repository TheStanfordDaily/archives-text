# Card netters to vie in Cal State tourney
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team is on
the move.
After an easy victory over the
University of San Diego Friday
(7-0) and a 7-2 win over cross
bay rival Cal, the Cards travel to
the Cal State Open in Pebble
Beach today. The tourney runs
through the week with the finals
Sunday afternoon.
As amateurs, none of the col
legians can accept any of the
$20,000 prize money donated by

Crocker Bank, the sponsor of the
tourney. But should any of the
college netters win the singles
title, the first place check would
go to the school or charity of the
player's choice.
The hottest Stanford netter en
tered in the tournament is junior
All-American Bill Maze, who re
cently downed the No. 2 men
from USC and UCLA in straight
sets.
Susie Hagey is also coming off
an impressive victory over
USC's Barbara Hallquist, the de
fending collegiate singles
champ. Sophomore Barb Jordan
is progressing well in her com
eback from tendinitis and the
No. 3 woman amateur could do
well in her bid for the singles
title.
UCLA's Ferdi Taygan — the
highest ranking collegian in the
country according to the USTA
— will be Maze's biggest threat.
Taygan will be joined by Bruin
teammates, Bruce Nichols, John
Austin and Van Winitsky, the
No. 4 ranked junior in the coun
try-
Pepperdine could also make a
good showing with its interna
tional lineup featuring South Af
rica's Eddie Edwards, the South
ern Cal Intercollegiate Champ,
and Leo Palin of Finland.
