## SPORTS Cards push Bruins to four UCLA drops spikers 
### Stacy Geiken 
The Stanford volleyball team
pushed defending national
champions UCLA to four games
in a losing effort in the NCAA
Regionals at Santa Barbara Fri
day night.
The Cardinals lost the first two
games, 8-15, 5-15, then came
back to win, 15-10 before loosing
the final game 12-15.
"We played well overall,"
coach Art Lambert said of the
Cards' regional performance.
"UCLA has a lot of talent,"
Lambert said. "They are a hard
combination to beat. They have
tremendous depth."
Lambert praised the team of
fense noting that the Cards,
"traded sido-outs for about 20
minutes," when the score was
tied 3-3 in the first game.
"Other teams would not have
held on as long," he said.
Mistake
In the second game the Cards
did not look themselves as they
were easily defeated, 5-15.
"It was probably my fault,"
Lambert said. "1 screwed up the

rotation in the second game."
"It was a mistake," setter
Andy Fishburn said, "it was no
thing fancy, we just wanted to
switch the setters to their oppo
site sides."
The Cards resumed their old
line-up in the third game and
began to play the consistent vol
leyball that helped them win the
Northern California Conference
Championships the week before.
"That made us so mad (the
second game) and fired up,"
Fishburn said, "we put it to 'em.
We played flawless ball."
The Cards beat the No. 1
seeded Bruins, 15-10 in the third
game.
The fourth game found Stan
ford down, 7-1 before the Cards
started to fight back. They cut
the lead down, making it 12-10
before loosing 15-12.
"They made a string of points
in the beginning that we
couldn't make up," Fishburn
said.
Fishburn cited the middle of

fense as UCLA's strong point,
while on a team to team com
parison, the Cards were "right in
there" with the Bruins.
"I was able to isolate the sets
well and Duralde was just hit
ting super," he said.
Tom Duralde, the 6-foot-2
senior captain from J v ullerton,
was called one of the oustanding
players for the Cards this year by
Lambert.
"Duralde was superb." Lam
bert said.
Looking back on the season as
a whole, Lambert said the Cards
had a "great season" and a "fine
team effort" in the regionals.
Looking ahead, Lambert said
that the Cards are, "back to
where we were" in the begin
ning of the season, due to the
loss of "three fine players"
(Fishburn, Duralde and Rich
Rand will be graduating).
Lambert said, however, that
the Cards are only a "year or two
away" from beating teams like
UCLA.

Card spiker Andy Fishburn celebrates a point in volleyball action
earlier this season.
The Stanford volleyball team
pushed defending national
champions UCLA to four games
in a losing effort in the NCAA
Regionals at Santa Barbara Fri
day night.
The Cardinals lost the first two
games, 8-15, 5-15, then came
back to win, 15-10 before loosing
the final game 12-15.
"We played well overall,"
coach Art Lambert said of the
Cards' regional performance.
"UCLA has a lot of talent,"
Lambert said. "They are a hard
combination to beat. They have
tremendous depth."
Lambert praised the team of
fense noting that the Cards,
"traded sido-outs for about 20
minutes," when the score was
tied 3-3 in the first game.
"Other teams would not have
held on as long," he said.
Mistake
In the second game the Cards
did not look themselves as they
were easily defeated, 5-15.
"It was probably my fault,"
Lambert said. "1 screwed up the

rotation in the second game."
"It was a mistake," setter
Andy Fishburn said, "it was no
thing fancy, we just wanted to
switch the setters to their oppo
site sides."
The Cards resumed their old
line-up in the third game and
began to play the consistent vol
leyball that helped them win the
Northern California Conference
Championships the week before.
"That made us so mad (the
second game) and fired up,"
Fishburn said, "we put it to 'em.
We played flawless ball."
The Cards beat the No. 1
seeded Bruins, 15-10 in the third
game.
The fourth game found Stan
ford down, 7-1 before the Cards
started to fight back. They cut
the lead down, making it 12-10
before loosing 15-12.
"They made a string of points
in the beginning that we
couldn't make up," Fishburn
said.
Fishburn cited the middle of

fense as UCLA's strong point,
while on a team to team com
parison, the Cards were "right in
there" with the Bruins.
"I was able to isolate the sets
well and Duralde was just hit
ting super," he said.
Tom Duralde, the 6-foot-2
senior captain from J v ullerton,
was called one of the oustanding
players for the Cards this year by
Lambert.
"Duralde was superb." Lam
bert said.
Looking back on the season as
a whole, Lambert said the Cards
had a "great season" and a "fine
team effort" in the regionals.
Looking ahead, Lambert said
that the Cards are, "back to
where we were" in the begin
ning of the season, due to the
loss of "three fine players"
(Fishburn, Duralde and Rich
Rand will be graduating).
Lambert said, however, that
the Cards are only a "year or two
away" from beating teams like
UCLA.
