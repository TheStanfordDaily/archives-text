The Stanford Cardinals added
two more non-conference vic
tories to their season record this
past weekend when they
traveled to Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo for a three game series.
Stanford defeated the Mus
tangs 5-1 Friday evening and
split Saturday's doubleheader
losing the first game 0-3 and
coming back to take the conclud
ing seven inning contest 5-1.
The Cards displayed impres
sive pitching and top notch de
fense against Cal Poly keying
their wins over the top 10 ranked
Division-Two team. Brian Harri
son hurled six no hit innings in
the series opener Friday and
John Yandle pitched extremely
wel 1 in both of Saturday's games.
"We could have done better
offensively," Stanford head

coach Mark Marquess said. "1
don't think we hit the ball that
well. We're lucky to have taken
two out of three." But Marquess
complimented the pitching re
marking Harrison concentrated
well and Yandle worked out
well in relief.
Harrison lasted the full nine
innings in Friday's game allow
ing six hits, walking sev in and
striking out one. Harrison held
the Mustangs to one unearned
run in the bottom of the third.
On Saturday, Cal Poly starter
Doug O'Brien fired a two-hitter
containing the Cards.
In the second game of the
doubleheader, Yandle relieved
Larry Kuhn in the second inning
and picked up the win for Stan
ford playing the rest of the seven
inning game.
