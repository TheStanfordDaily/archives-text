# Jim Hodges eyes future on and off the court

It's the little things that make freshman Jim
Hogdes the No. 4 man on Stanford's varsity tennis
team.
Little things like winning the National In
terscholastics last year in both singles and doubles.
Little things like being a member of the Junior
Davis Cup team.
Little things like being ranked twelfth in the na
tion in the 18-and-under division in 1976.
Little things like winning the Northern California
doubles championship with junior All-American
Perry Wright by filling in for a sick Matt Mitchell.
The Card duo defeated Cal's Steve Hahn and Carlos
Aquilar 5-7, 6-3, 6-2.
"When I win a point, 1 try to use the same ball
again," Hodges explained. "And before I play a
match 1 listen to David Bowie."
Another psyching tactic Hodges uses is talking to
himself while he's playing. He said it reminds him
that even if he's just won a set, he can't let up on his
drive to win the next one too.
"I enjoy playing a little bit mad," said Hodges.
"His greatest strength is his inner character and
his tremendous competitive abilities," Stanford ten
nis coach Dick Gould said. "I know when he plays
he's going to give his best."
Team man
Gould described Hodges as a "team man," one
who is more concerned with the welfare of the team
than with his standing on the individual ladder.
Hodges unknowingly confirmed his coach's view
when he called Stanford's upset of UCLA and USC
one of the high points of his tennis career, "not just
personally, but for the team."
He plays a strategic game, with a deadly left
handed serve. Evidently this combination is a win
ner, since Hodges has trounced the No. 1 singles
players from both Cal and San Jose this year.
Hodges, who was moved up to the No. 4 spot last
week, has also played a decisive role team-wise as a
member of the No. 3 doubles combination. Hodges
and partner Peter Rennert have won several matches
this season which proved crucial to Stanford vic
tories. Their biggest win was over UCLA's Jon Paley
and Tony Graham, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (5-1). The team score
was Stanford 3, UCLA 2 when Hodges-Rennert took
to the court in the last afternoon match. Their win

eased the pressure off Stanford's indoor competitors
by clinching the team victory.
Down on me
Although he realizes he can't play well all the
time, Hodges said he still gets depressed when he's
had a bad day.
"I always like to be the best at whatever 1 do," said
Hodges. When he doesn't live up to his own expecta
tions, he usually goes to practice the next day and
"works harder."
Hodges said that when he lost a big match in the
early days ol his tennis career, he indulged in the
typical tantrums expected of young and talented
players, but "1 don't think I've done anything like
that here."
Hard work
Gould attributes Hodges' success to lots of hard
work. Hodges is the only member of the team who
never fails to run his warm-up mile and serve a
bucket of balls before beginning his daily three hours
of practice, according to the coach.
In addition, Hodges' silhouette is a familiar sight
at the end of corridor two-west in Branner Hall,
where he does extra exercises to prevent muscle
pulls and other injuries.
While injuries aren't part of .Hodges' plans, a
career in tennis is. He plans to enter one of the Euro
pean circuits this summer, with his eye on pro tennis
in the future.
"Hopefully 1 d like to become a singles player,"
Hodges said, because it's "more of a reward. You
have to take all of the blame or all of the credit."
Besides a possible pro tennis career, Hodges is
considering an International Relations major and
perhaps a job in government service.
An Easterner from Chevy Chase, Maryland,
Hodges said the main difference between the East
and West coasts as far as tennis is concerned is that
young players are limited to spring and summer
practice because of snow.
"I began to catch up when I was 14 or 15," said
Hodges.
Hodges has been playing tennis since he was eight
years old and was recruited by Gould in 1975, after
the National Hardcourts in Burlingame. Gould said
he had been watching Hodges in the national age
group standings for several years and was impressed
with Hodges' consistent high ranking.
