Pakistan political crisis continues
Islamabad, Pakistan — Hopes for a negotiated
settlement in Pakistan's bloody political crisis
dwindled yesterday when a key opposition leader
announced that Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's
latest peace offers had been rejected.
Retired Air Marshal Asghar Khan, who is under
police detention, said in a statement smuggled to
outside supporters that the opposition Pakistan Na
tional Alliance (PNA) would continue its campaign
of civil disobedience until Bhutto resigns.
Khan appealed to the armed services to disobey
Bhutto's orders, saying the prime minister rep
resented an "unlawful" government.
The PNA has accused Bhutto of rigging the March
7 national parliamentary elections, in which the rul
ing Pakistan People's party won four-fifths of the
seats in the National Assembly.
Khan, in a statement sent from a government guest
house where he was being detained, said PNA lead
ers had agreed not to compromise on their demands
that Bhutto resign, that a new election commissioner
be appointed and that new elections be held.
Hundreds jailed at nuclear plant site
Seabrook, N.H. — Police arrested and jailed hun
dreds of demonstrators on trespass charges yester
day after they refused to leave the construction site of
a proposed nuclear power plant on New Hamp
shire's seacoast.
State police, wearing normal duty uniforms,
moved into a crowd estimated at about 2000 and
methodically picked out demonstrators, read them
their rights and guided or carried them to buses.
The arrest procedure went on tediously and peace
fully as the troopers photographed and fingerprinted
each demonstrator, some of whom fell limp as police

approached.
A Hampton District Court official said that more
than 750 demonstrators had been processed five
hours after the arrests began.
The men and women were taken 16 miles to the
Portsmouth Armory where they were arraigned in
groups of about a dozen before two judges.
Some of the early groups were given opportunities
for bail on amounts ranging from $100 to $500. Court
officials said most of those refused bail and chose
jail.
The demonstrators, who arrived at the construc
tion site Saturday afternoon, had vowed to remain
until they were arrested or until construction of the
power plant was halted.
Police moved out of a 40-acre enclosed compound
yesterday afternoon after the protesters rejected a
warning that they leave the 700-acre Public Service
Co. property.
Clashes mar May Day celebrations
London — May Day, the socialist world's holiday
of the worker, was celebrated yesterday with garden
parties in Peking and a huge flower-bedecked parade
in Moscow, but was marred by bloody clashes bet
ween demonstrators and police in Spain, Athens and
elsewhere.
Riot police in several Spanish cities used tear gas,
rubber bullets and clubs on those who defied a ban
on May Day demonstrations. Scores were injured.
Some demonstrators in the Madrid suburb of Val
lecas fought back with rocks as helmeted police
chased them, clubbing anyone they caught. Police
said 50 persons, including two journalists, were ar
rested in the Madrid violence.
Clashes between police and Maoist demonstrators
in Athens left 12 policemen and 20 other persons
injured and 15 persons arrested. Authorities said the
violence erupted after a peaceful rally when 100
banner-bearing leftist youths marched in defiance
of an official ban.
The rally by several thousand workers demanded
a 40-hour work week and curbs on inflation. Maoists
charged the rally was government-sponsored.
Pesticides found in human milk
Washington — Detectable levels of three pesticide

compounds were found in the milk of a majority of
nursing mothers tested by the Environmental Protec
tion Agency (EPA). But health experts say the low
levels pose no immediate health hazard to either
mothers or their newborn children.
"However, the possible long-term consequences
of these minute amounts are uncertain," the EPA
said in a statement accompanying the study released
yesterday.
All of the six pesticides involved in the test have
been curbed to some extent, "primarily because they
are suspected to be human cancer agents," EPA said.
In the study, milk samples taken during 1975 from
1436 nursing women in 150 hospitals across the
country were tested for six pesticide compounds:
dieldrin, heptachlor, a breakdown product of hep
tachlor called heptachlor epoxide, chlordane, a
chlordane breakdown product called oxychlordane
and Mirex.
The report said detectable levels of dieldrin,
oxychlordane and heptachlor epoxide were found in
the milk of a majority of nursing mothers.
"The average detectable amounts of these pes
ticides found in the women's milk were extremely
small," the EPA said.

outside supporters that the opposition Pakistan Na
tional Alliance (PNA) would continue its campaign
of civil disobedience until Bhutto resigns.
Khan appealed to the armed services to disobey
Bhutto's orders, saying the prime minister rep
resented an "unlawful" government.
The PNA has accused Bhutto of rigging the March
7 national parliamentary elections, in which the rul
ing Pakistan People's party won four-fifths of the
seats in the National Assembly.
Khan, in a statement sent from a government guest
house where he was being detained, said PNA lead
ers had agreed not to compromise on their demands
that Bhutto resign, that a new election commissioner
be appointed and that new elections be held.
Hundreds jailed at nuclear plant site
Seabrook, N.H. — Police arrested and jailed hun
dreds of demonstrators on trespass charges yester
day after they refused to leave the construction site of
a proposed nuclear power plant on New Hamp
shire's seacoast.
State police, wearing normal duty uniforms,
moved into a crowd estimated at about 2000 and
methodically picked out demonstrators, read them
their rights and guided or carried them to buses.
The arrest procedure went on tediously and peace
fully as the troopers photographed and fingerprinted
each demonstrator, some of whom fell limp as police

approached.
A Hampton District Court official said that more
than 750 demonstrators had been processed five
hours after the arrests began.
The men and women were taken 16 miles to the
Portsmouth Armory where they were arraigned in
groups of about a dozen before two judges.
Some of the early groups were given opportunities
for bail on amounts ranging from $100 to $500. Court
officials said most of those refused bail and chose
jail.
The demonstrators, who arrived at the construc
tion site Saturday afternoon, had vowed to remain
until they were arrested or until construction of the
power plant was halted.
Police moved out of a 40-acre enclosed compound
yesterday afternoon after the protesters rejected a
warning that they leave the 700-acre Public Service
Co. property.
Clashes mar May Day celebrations
London — May Day, the socialist world's holiday
of the worker, was celebrated yesterday with garden
parties in Peking and a huge flower-bedecked parade
in Moscow, but was marred by bloody clashes bet
ween demonstrators and police in Spain, Athens and
elsewhere.
Riot police in several Spanish cities used tear gas,
rubber bullets and clubs on those who defied a ban
on May Day demonstrations. Scores were injured.
Some demonstrators in the Madrid suburb of Val
lecas fought back with rocks as helmeted police
chased them, clubbing anyone they caught. Police
said 50 persons, including two journalists, were ar
rested in the Madrid violence.
Clashes between police and Maoist demonstrators
in Athens left 12 policemen and 20 other persons
injured and 15 persons arrested. Authorities said the
violence erupted after a peaceful rally when 100
banner-bearing leftist youths marched in defiance
of an official ban.
The rally by several thousand workers demanded
a 40-hour work week and curbs on inflation. Maoists
charged the rally was government-sponsored.
Pesticides found in human milk
Washington — Detectable levels of three pesticide

compounds were found in the milk of a majority of
nursing mothers tested by the Environmental Protec
tion Agency (EPA). But health experts say the low
levels pose no immediate health hazard to either
mothers or their newborn children.
"However, the possible long-term consequences
of these minute amounts are uncertain," the EPA
said in a statement accompanying the study released
yesterday.
All of the six pesticides involved in the test have
been curbed to some extent, "primarily because they
are suspected to be human cancer agents," EPA said.
In the study, milk samples taken during 1975 from
1436 nursing women in 150 hospitals across the
country were tested for six pesticide compounds:
dieldrin, heptachlor, a breakdown product of hep
tachlor called heptachlor epoxide, chlordane, a
chlordane breakdown product called oxychlordane
and Mirex.
The report said detectable levels of dieldrin,
oxychlordane and heptachlor epoxide were found in
the milk of a majority of nursing mothers.
"The average detectable amounts of these pes
ticides found in the women's milk were extremely
small," the EPA said.

The PNA has accused Bhutto of rigging the March
7 national parliamentary elections, in which the rul
ing Pakistan People's party won four-fifths of the
seats in the National Assembly.
Khan, in a statement sent from a government guest
house where he was being detained, said PNA lead
ers had agreed not to compromise on their demands
that Bhutto resign, that a new election commissioner
be appointed and that new elections be held.
Hundreds jailed at nuclear plant site
Seabrook, N.H. — Police arrested and jailed hun
dreds of demonstrators on trespass charges yester
day after they refused to leave the construction site of
a proposed nuclear power plant on New Hamp
shire's seacoast.
State police, wearing normal duty uniforms,
moved into a crowd estimated at about 2000 and
methodically picked out demonstrators, read them
their rights and guided or carried them to buses.
The arrest procedure went on tediously and peace
fully as the troopers photographed and fingerprinted
each demonstrator, some of whom fell limp as police

approached.
A Hampton District Court official said that more
than 750 demonstrators had been processed five
hours after the arrests began.
The men and women were taken 16 miles to the
Portsmouth Armory where they were arraigned in
groups of about a dozen before two judges.
Some of the early groups were given opportunities
for bail on amounts ranging from $100 to $500. Court
officials said most of those refused bail and chose
jail.
The demonstrators, who arrived at the construc
tion site Saturday afternoon, had vowed to remain
until they were arrested or until construction of the
power plant was halted.
Police moved out of a 40-acre enclosed compound
yesterday afternoon after the protesters rejected a
warning that they leave the 700-acre Public Service
Co. property.
Clashes mar May Day celebrations
London — May Day, the socialist world's holiday
of the worker, was celebrated yesterday with garden
parties in Peking and a huge flower-bedecked parade
in Moscow, but was marred by bloody clashes bet
ween demonstrators and police in Spain, Athens and
elsewhere.
Riot police in several Spanish cities used tear gas,
rubber bullets and clubs on those who defied a ban
on May Day demonstrations. Scores were injured.
Some demonstrators in the Madrid suburb of Val
lecas fought back with rocks as helmeted police
chased them, clubbing anyone they caught. Police
said 50 persons, including two journalists, were ar
rested in the Madrid violence.
Clashes between police and Maoist demonstrators
in Athens left 12 policemen and 20 other persons
injured and 15 persons arrested. Authorities said the
violence erupted after a peaceful rally when 100
banner-bearing leftist youths marched in defiance
of an official ban.
The rally by several thousand workers demanded
a 40-hour work week and curbs on inflation. Maoists
charged the rally was government-sponsored.
Pesticides found in human milk
Washington — Detectable levels of three pesticide

compounds were found in the milk of a majority of
nursing mothers tested by the Environmental Protec
tion Agency (EPA). But health experts say the low
levels pose no immediate health hazard to either
mothers or their newborn children.
"However, the possible long-term consequences
of these minute amounts are uncertain," the EPA
said in a statement accompanying the study released
yesterday.
All of the six pesticides involved in the test have
been curbed to some extent, "primarily because they
are suspected to be human cancer agents," EPA said.
In the study, milk samples taken during 1975 from
1436 nursing women in 150 hospitals across the
country were tested for six pesticide compounds:
dieldrin, heptachlor, a breakdown product of hep
tachlor called heptachlor epoxide, chlordane, a
chlordane breakdown product called oxychlordane
and Mirex.
The report said detectable levels of dieldrin,
oxychlordane and heptachlor epoxide were found in
the milk of a majority of nursing mothers.
"The average detectable amounts of these pes
ticides found in the women's milk were extremely
small," the EPA said.
