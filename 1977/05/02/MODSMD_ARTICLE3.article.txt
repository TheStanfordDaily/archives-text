# Nixon says coverup political, not criminal
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Richard Nixon
says his immediate actions after the
Watergate burglary were designed
"not to try to cover up a criminal ac
tion" but to contain scandal for politi
cal reasons.
The former president, in a television
interview to be aired Wednesday, says
he wanted to avoid "any slopover in a
way that would damage innocent
people."
The interview, the first of a series of
four, marks the end of Nixon's self
imposed public silence on the Water
gate scandal that brought his resigna
tion.
Media splash
Nixon's week of Watergate-revisited
began yesterday with a media splash

and disclosures that he was involved
in the scandal and hush-money pay
ments earlier than previously known.
The transcript of a White House tape
recording never before published
showed the former president was
aware of money-for-silence demands
in January 1973, fully 2V2 months be
fore John Dean's "cancer on the presi
dency" speech. Nixon has always
claimed that the talk with Dean, his
counsel, was the first he knew of the
demands.
Another recording, made after Dean
began telling prosecutors about the
coverup, showed Nixon saying: "Do
you think the people, ah, the United
States, are gonna impeach the Presi
dent on the basis of John Dean?" Fif
teen months later a House committee
voted to recommend impeachment.
Little information
The recordings, used in the Frost in
terview, added little new information
to what already was known about Ni
xon's actions from the June 17, 1972,
break-in at Democratic party head
quarters in the Watergate office build
ing to his resignation Aug. 9, 1974.
But they do reinforce that he was
preoccupied with Watergate from the
beginning. Three days after the break
in, he told aide Charles Colson that: "It
doesn't sound like a skillful job ... If
we didn't know better, I would have
thought it was deliberately botched."
The transcripts have been in the
possession of Watergate lawyers for
over three years. Their simultaneous
release to two newspapers and two
weekly news magazines coincide with
the Wednesday showing of the first of
Frost's interviews with Nixon — the
segment dealing with Watergate.
Tight ship
The Frost organization, which sold
the Nixon series to an "overnight net
work" of 145 stations, has held Nixon's
remarks closely. A spokesman said the
new transcripts were not released by
Frost. The current Watergate pro
secutor, Charles Ruff, said his office

didn't furnish the transcripts either.
The transcripts were made by the
Special Watergate Prosecution Force
for possible use in the 1974 Watergate
coverup trial of former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell, and former top Nixon aides
H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman,
all of whom were convicted.
The tapes, however, were thought to
duplicate some of the 33 other record
ings played for the jury and thus were
used only in part, or not at all. Defense
lawyers were furnished with trans
cripts, in accord with trial rules.
Tape gap
Nixon told Frost that when he dis
cussed the break-in with Haldeman on
June 20, 1973 — the conversation
erased in the famed 18V2-minute gap—
he merely ordered "a public relations
offensive on what the other side is do
ing."
Frost asked why then did he tell Col
son the same day "we're just going to
leave this where it is, with the Cu
bans?" — a reference to the four
Cuban-Americans then already
charged with the burglary.
"My motive in everything I was say
ing or certainly thinking at the time
was not to try to cover up a criminal
action but . . . we weren't going to
allow people in the White House,
people in the re-election committee at
the highest levels who were not in
volved to be smeared by the whole
thing. In other words, we were trying
to politically contain it."
Time and Newsweek are featuring
Nixon on their covers this week, and
included generous quotations from the
transcripts. Stories based on the tapes
appeared on the front pages of the New
York Times and the Washington Post
yesterday.
With the exception of his brush with
death from the complications of
phlebitis and his subsequent trip to
China, Nixon has remained out of the
limelight — seldom venturing from
seclusion of his home in San
Clemente.

Nixon told Frost that when he dis
cussed the break-in with Haldeman on
June 20, 1973 — the conversation
erased in the famed 18V2-minute gap—
he merely ordered "a public relations

ing."
Frost asked why then did he tell Col
son the same day "we're just going to
leave this where it is, with the Cu
bans?" — a reference to the four
Cuban-Americans then already
charged with the burglary.
"My motive in everything I was say
ing or certainly thinking at the time
was not to try to cover up a criminal
action but . . . we weren't going to
allow people in the White House,
people in the re-election committee at
the highest levels who were not in
volved to be smeared by the whole
thing. In other words, we were trying
to politically contain it."
Time and Newsweek are featuring
Nixon on their covers this week, and
included generous quotations from the
transcripts. Stories based on the tapes
appeared on the front pages of the New

yesterday.
With the exception of his brush with
death from the complications of
phlebitis and his subsequent trip to
China, Nixon has remained out of the
limelight — seldom venturing from
seclusion of his home in San
Clemente.

Nixon emerges
In the first four interviews with Robert Frost, former president Richard Nixon
stressed that his post-Watergate actions were not designed to cover up a
criminal action but to contain the scandal for political reasons. The first
interview will be broadcast Wednesday at 7:30-9 p.m. on Channel 5.
New York (AP) — Richard Nixon
says his immediate actions after the
Watergate burglary were designed
"not to try to cover up a criminal ac
tion" but to contain scandal for politi
cal reasons.
The former president, in a television
interview to be aired Wednesday, says
he wanted to avoid "any slopover in a
way that would damage innocent
people."
The interview, the first of a series of
four, marks the end of Nixon's self
imposed public silence on the Water
gate scandal that brought his resigna
tion.
Media splash
Nixon's week of Watergate-revisited
began yesterday with a media splash

and disclosures that he was involved
in the scandal and hush-money pay
ments earlier than previously known.
The transcript of a White House tape
recording never before published
showed the former president was
aware of money-for-silence demands
in January 1973, fully 2V2 months be
fore John Dean's "cancer on the presi
dency" speech. Nixon has always
claimed that the talk with Dean, his
counsel, was the first he knew of the
demands.
Another recording, made after Dean
began telling prosecutors about the
coverup, showed Nixon saying: "Do
you think the people, ah, the United
States, are gonna impeach the Presi
dent on the basis of John Dean?" Fif
teen months later a House committee
voted to recommend impeachment.
Little information
The recordings, used in the Frost in
terview, added little new information
to what already was known about Ni
xon's actions from the June 17, 1972,
break-in at Democratic party head
quarters in the Watergate office build
ing to his resignation Aug. 9, 1974.
But they do reinforce that he was
preoccupied with Watergate from the
beginning. Three days after the break
in, he told aide Charles Colson that: "It
doesn't sound like a skillful job ... If
we didn't know better, I would have
thought it was deliberately botched."
The transcripts have been in the
possession of Watergate lawyers for
over three years. Their simultaneous
release to two newspapers and two
weekly news magazines coincide with
the Wednesday showing of the first of
Frost's interviews with Nixon — the
segment dealing with Watergate.
Tight ship
The Frost organization, which sold
the Nixon series to an "overnight net
work" of 145 stations, has held Nixon's
remarks closely. A spokesman said the
new transcripts were not released by
Frost. The current Watergate pro
secutor, Charles Ruff, said his office

didn't furnish the transcripts either.
The transcripts were made by the
Special Watergate Prosecution Force
for possible use in the 1974 Watergate
coverup trial of former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell, and former top Nixon aides
H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman,
all of whom were convicted.
The tapes, however, were thought to
duplicate some of the 33 other record
ings played for the jury and thus were
used only in part, or not at all. Defense
lawyers were furnished with trans
cripts, in accord with trial rules.
