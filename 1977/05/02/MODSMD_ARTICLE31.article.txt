# Groundskeeper fired; USE files grievances
## 
### Mark Schleiss 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has filed a grievance against Plant Ser
vices protesting the firing of worker
Doug Friedfeld, according to USE Vice
President John Leung.
USE is claiming Plant Services viol
ated the union's contract because
Friedfeld was paid at temporary work
ers' wages longer than four months.
The contract stipulates that a tem
porary worker can be hired only for a
four-month period, after which he
must be hired full-time or laid off.
Leung said Friedfeld has been a
full-time groundskeeper and equip
ment operator since July 26, 1976.
Union officials held a rally Friday
near the Plant Services office to protest
the firing. About 40 Plant Services
employes were on hand for the rally,
which was held "mainly to let the pub
lic know about the grave injustice that
has been committed to Doug by man
agement violating his work contract,"
Leung said.
Friday last day
According to Leung, Friedfeld pro
tested the alleged contract violation to
Plant Services and was laid off. Friday
was Friedfeld's last day of work.
Leung said he felt the union would
win the grievance within four or five
months and that Friedfeld would work
again for Plant Services.
At the rally, protest was also heard
on another management policy which
involves a study by Wofac, Inc., a firm
of industrial engineers. The study re
commended that Plant Services re
duce the payroll by not replacing per
sons who retire or resign, according to
Jason Mavis, director of Plant Services.
Mavis said the study would not re
sult in any layoffs.
Leung, however, claimed manage
ment was using the Wofac study to
reduce the number of union employes.

"Doug was laid off," he pointed out.
"Wofac has the reputation of being the
'hatchet men' of management, and
that's the case here," Leuny, said.
Friedfeld said his demands for full
time salary probably led to his firing.
"There's plenty of work for us if they
don't pay us a full salary, and there's
not enough work for us if they have to
pay full wages," he said.
After the mistake was discovered,
Mavis said, Friedfeld was paid full
union wage retroactively from July 26.
