# SCRIP simulates segregation to demonstrate evil of apartheid
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Stanford has been symbolically
segregated today by the Stanford
Committee for Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP) in order to
graphically demonstrate the meaning
of apartheid.
One thousand "Blacks Only" and
"Non-Blacks Only" signs have been
posted at appropriate locations across
the campus, according to SCRIP
member Larry Litvak.
"It's like bringing a piece of South
Africa to Stanford," Litvak said. "We
want to show the people in this com
munity what the daily reality of living
in segregated society is really like."
Guerilla theater in dorm dining halls
tonight will further reinforce the
meaning of apartheid, he said.
Week of protest
The segregation of the campus is
part of a week of protest organized by
SCRIP to urge the Board of Trustees to
reverse their previous decision to abs
tain on shareholder proxies against
U.S. corporate investment in South Af
rica.
SCRIP has also organized a vigil and
hunger strike beginning today at noon
in White Plaza and a rally and march
on President Richard Lyman's office
tomorrow.
"We're using the vigil to focus atten
tion on the proxy vote on Caltex on
Tuesday," Litvak said.
The proxy vote, on which the board
of trustees bas already abstained, calls
for the withdrawal of Caltex, a sub
sidiary of Standard Oil of California
and Texaco, from South Africa.
John Grey, who was elected to the
board of trustees last December, is
president of Standard Oil ofCalifornia.
The rally protesting the trustees
abstention will begin at noon tomor
row and feature guerilla theatre,
speakers, including COP member Ann
Henkels, and statements of support for
SCRIP by several campus organiza
tions.
The protestors will then march to
President Lyman's office and present
him with petitions calling for the trus

tees to vote for the South African pro
xies.
The petitions have been circulating
about a month, according to SCRIP
member Steve Vettel, and over 2500
signatures have been collected.
SCRIP has called for the reconven
ing of the Committee on Investment
Responsibility (CIR), citing the peti
tion signatures as evidence of a com
munity consensus. However, Henry
Rowen, CIR chairman, has decided no
change has occurred in the situation,
Vettel said.
SCRIP has also distributed "close to
1000" black armbands as a manifesta
tion of protest against Stanford's com
plicity in apartheid, and over 4000
flyers.
In related developments:
—the Board of Trustees sent letters
to five major corporations urging them
to "use all reasonable means to combat
racial discrimination" in South Africa;

—the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) has urged support of the South
African proxies;
—members of a SWOPSI class on in
vestment responsibility released a pos
ition paper urging support of the
South African proxies; and
—Assoc. Prof of Political Science
David Abernethy suggested to the Fa
culty Senate that the CIR formulate its
own proxy proposals. /
On April 15, the board sent letters to
Standard Oil of California, Texaco,
General Electric, Goodyear Tire and
Rubber and Union Carbide, stating
that while the efforts of these five firms
tobring about change have been "posi
tive," they must be "accelerated and
intensified."
"Our view is that the active in
volvement of American companies in
South Africa offers the best hope of
constructive change in that country,"
the letters read.
In an April 22 "call for responsible
investment policies at Stanford Uni
versity," newly elected COP members
Anne Henkels, Steven Westly, Glenn
Jordan and Greg Larson urged the Uni
versity to vote in favor of the South
African proxies on which the trustees
abstained.
Members of SWOPSII93, "The Uni
versity as an Institutional Investor,"
said in their position paper that
abstention "is not the neutral act the
Board of Trustees claim it to be.
"Instead it is a conscious abrogation
of the University's incurred obliga
tions as a concerned partial owner (of a
corporation)."
Abernethy told the Faculty Senate
last week that, "the problem with
being reactive to other people's pro
xies is that the issues of policy alterna
tives are framed in a way we may not
like."
Abernethy supported a more mod
erate, practical approach to the prob
lem, offering an example of a resolu
tion that he said would have won wide
acceptance here.

Week of protest
The segregation of the campus is
part of a week of protest organized by
SCRIP to urge the Board of Trustees to
reverse their previous decision to abs
tain on shareholder proxies against
U.S. corporate investment in South Af
rica.
SCRIP has also organized a vigil and
hunger strike beginning today at noon
in White Plaza and a rally and march
on President Richard Lyman's office
tomorrow.
"We're using the vigil to focus atten
tion on the proxy vote on Caltex on
Tuesday," Litvak said.
The proxy vote, on which the board
of trustees bas already abstained, calls
for the withdrawal of Caltex, a sub
sidiary of Standard Oil of California
and Texaco, from South Africa.
John Grey, who was elected to the
board of trustees last December, is
president of Standard Oil ofCalifornia.
The rally protesting the trustees
abstention will begin at noon tomor
row and feature guerilla theatre,
speakers, including COP member Ann
Henkels, and statements of support for
SCRIP by several campus organiza
tions.
The protestors will then march to
President Lyman's office and present
him with petitions calling for the trus

tees to vote for the South African pro
xies.
The petitions have been circulating
about a month, according to SCRIP
member Steve Vettel, and over 2500
signatures have been collected.
SCRIP has called for the reconven
ing of the Committee on Investment
Responsibility (CIR), citing the peti
tion signatures as evidence of a com
munity consensus. However, Henry
Rowen, CIR chairman, has decided no
change has occurred in the situation,
Vettel said.
SCRIP has also distributed "close to
1000" black armbands as a manifesta
tion of protest against Stanford's com
plicity in apartheid, and over 4000
flyers.
In related developments:
—the Board of Trustees sent letters
to five major corporations urging them
to "use all reasonable means to combat
racial discrimination" in South Africa;

—the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) has urged support of the South
African proxies;
—members of a SWOPSI class on in
vestment responsibility released a pos
ition paper urging support of the
South African proxies; and
—Assoc. Prof of Political Science
David Abernethy suggested to the Fa
culty Senate that the CIR formulate its
own proxy proposals. /
On April 15, the board sent letters to
Standard Oil of California, Texaco,
General Electric, Goodyear Tire and
Rubber and Union Carbide, stating
that while the efforts of these five firms
tobring about change have been "posi
tive," they must be "accelerated and
intensified."
"Our view is that the active in
volvement of American companies in
South Africa offers the best hope of
constructive change in that country,"
the letters read.
In an April 22 "call for responsible
investment policies at Stanford Uni
versity," newly elected COP members
Anne Henkels, Steven Westly, Glenn
Jordan and Greg Larson urged the Uni
versity to vote in favor of the South
African proxies on which the trustees
abstained.
Members of SWOPSII93, "The Uni
versity as an Institutional Investor,"
said in their position paper that
abstention "is not the neutral act the
Board of Trustees claim it to be.
"Instead it is a conscious abrogation
of the University's incurred obliga
tions as a concerned partial owner (of a
corporation)."
Abernethy told the Faculty Senate
last week that, "the problem with
being reactive to other people's pro
xies is that the issues of policy alterna
tives are framed in a way we may not
like."
Abernethy supported a more mod
erate, practical approach to the prob
lem, offering an example of a resolu
tion that he said would have won wide
acceptance here.
Stanford has been symbolically
segregated today by the Stanford
Committee for Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP) in order to
graphically demonstrate the meaning
of apartheid.
One thousand "Blacks Only" and
"Non-Blacks Only" signs have been
posted at appropriate locations across
the campus, according to SCRIP
member Larry Litvak.
"It's like bringing a piece of South
Africa to Stanford," Litvak said. "We
want to show the people in this com
munity what the daily reality of living
in segregated society is really like."
Guerilla theater in dorm dining halls
