# Title IX may force lift of sorority ban
## 
### Sallie Bray 
"Title IX has forced the issue; there's no way to get
around it," said Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson, in reference to the Housing
Office's plan to ask the Board of Trustees to rescind
the University's 33-year-old ban on sororities in
June.
The University may be violating Title IX, a law
against sex discrimination, because subjective selec
tivity is currently "a privilege available to male stu
dents and not available to female students," Robin
son explained.
According to James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, the "ultimate sanction" for violating Title
IX is "withdrawal of federal funding."
Robinson explained the Housing Office will not go
to the board in May because its presentation is not
ready.
Exploration needed
According to Robinson, issues related to the pos
sible rescinding of the ban on sororities, such as
student interest and demand, housing options, and
alumnae support, need to be explored.
Robinson said these issues were not fully re
searched in time for the May meeting because the

Housing Office had more immediate concerns, such
as the housing draw and house associate (RA) selec
tion. He also mentioned he had seen little visible
enthusiasm for bringing sororities back.
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) President Jordan
Schwartz disagreed. As evidence of student and ad
ministrative interest, he noted the Committee of Ser
vices to Students' (COSS) February recommendation
to rescind the ban. He said Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons "seems to be stalling now that the issue
is out of the public eye."
However, Schwartz said, "I'd hate to see this
whole thing drag on until summer." He noted that
little student input is available after mid-June.
The IFC plans to "generate and judge interest" in
regard to sororities, Schwartz said.
Renew charters
If the ban is lifted, there is still the issue of whether
the national sororities active here prior to the ban
will wish to renew their charters.
The nine former sororities are Alpha Omicron Pi,
Alpha Phi International Fraternity, Chi Omega,
Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta,
Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi
Beta Phi.

According to Joyce Shumway, executive general
office manager of Alpha Phi International Fraternity,
her sororitv is "very interested in coming back."
"We would like to see the ban lifted," said Roberta
Moore, national director of expansion for Gamma
Phi Beta.
According to Moore, the first step toward renew
ing the chapter is filing a letter of interest with the
dean of student affairs.
Delta Gamma National President Mary Ann Bow
yer said her sorority is "very aware" of the possible
repeal of the ban. She explained Delta Gamma will
not take action, though, until "the Board of Trustees
has made a decision."
"1 wouldn't be opposed to permitting sororities,
but I question whether they are really needed,"
explained Trustee Dr. William McColl. He said he
questions how much sororities are desired because
"the women's Row houses aren't currently high
priority houses."
However, Schwartz said, "It's dangerous for the
University to start looking at Roth and Storey and
then draw parallels." It is his opinion that there is "a
critical difference between sororities and women's
Row houses."
