# Bids solicited for controversial wall
## 
### Sue Rice 
Architect's drawings are nearly
complete and bids are scheduled to be
solicited in about two weeks for con
struction of the so-called Albers' wall,
according to Associate Provost Ed
ward Shaw. The wall will be erected in
Lomita Mall, between the Quad and
the Physics Tank.
Actual construction should begin
this summer on the 9-foot high 54-foot
long brick structure which will cost
between $50,000 and $90,000, Shaw
said. Work on the wall, a sculptural
design by Josef Albers, should be com
pleted within two or three months.
A controversy evolved over placing
the wall on Canfield Court, the strip of
lawn between the Law School and
Meyer Library.
In January 1976, however, the Com
mittee on Land and Building De
velopment rejected that site by a five to
three vote following a recommenda
tion from its Subcommittee on Out
door Art.
Last spring, the committee agreed to
the alternative Lomita Mall site, and
that proposal was approved by Presi
dent Richard Lyman.
Three years of work
Construction will culminate over
three years of work on the wall project,
Shaw said. Art Prof. Albert Elsen and
alumni with professional interest in
Albers discussed with the artist three
years ago the idea of donating a work
to the University. As a result, Albers
offered the wall design to the Univer

sity, according to Shaw.
Since that time, placement of the
work has been held up due to funding
problems, Shaw said. Funding will
come from the Albers Foundation and
some special alumni gifts, according
to Art Dept. Chairman Lorenz Eitner.
Originally, the sculpture was to be
erected near the museum, but "we felt
that was an out-of-the-way location for
this type of art," Shaw said.
Though work should be completed
within three months, Shaw said it
could take up to six months to finish
because of problems finding needed
materials.
Special granite
Albers specified a certain type of
granite which is quarried in Africa and
cut in Italy which has not been ordered
yet since plans are incomplete.
Though the University is trying to
substitute stone produced in Texas, it
may have to use the African stone.
There may be some delays getting it
here, Shaw said.
TheCanfield Court site had met with
protest from law students and faculty.
Their views prevailed, but Law School
Dean Charles Meyers said the objec
tions were "not aesthetic," Meyers
said. "It was a location problem."
Meyers was chairman of the com
mittee when the site determination
was made.
Shaw said he also felt objections to
the wall were linked to the proposed
location. Canfield Court is too small,
and the wall would have blocked side

lines of all buildings, he said.
The art piece "is not intellectually
out of order by the Physics Tank be
cause Albers' wall is a form of technol
ogy. Albers did not think in terms of
landscape and portrait," Eitner said.
"It is an architectural statement to
other architecture surrounding it, giv
ing the whole area refinement and pre
cision," Eitner commented.
Shaw said he "would be very sur
prised" if the wall became the object of
vandalism after work is completed. "I
think the emotionalism dealt only
with the Canfield Court site."
He added, however, that even if
vandalism does occur, the wall will be
coated with a material which will
allow for "easy cleaning."
But Senior Planner Robert Cairns
said a full-size wooden mock-up of the
wall erected last year on the court was
promptly torn down.
"Vandalism is a form of blackmail,"
Eitner said. "It is like someone proudly
announcing he's going to pollute the
environment."
He paralleled the threat of van
dalism to abuse in the museum. "If you
give in to threat, do you close the
museum? If society gets down to that
level, you get down to the fortress de
fense — a level we don't want to sink
to," he said.
Unlike the objections raised about
the Canfield Court site by Law School
students and faculty last year, opposi
tion to the plan appears absent in the
Physics Department.

of the site (pictured above) was erected last year in
Canfield Court, the original proposed location for
the wall.
Architect's drawings are nearly
complete and bids are scheduled to be
solicited in about two weeks for con
struction of the so-called Albers' wall,
according to Associate Provost Ed
ward Shaw. The wall will be erected in
Lomita Mall, between the Quad and
the Physics Tank.
Actual construction should begin
this summer on the 9-foot high 54-foot
long brick structure which will cost
between $50,000 and $90,000, Shaw
said. Work on the wall, a sculptural
design by Josef Albers, should be com
pleted within two or three months.
A controversy evolved over placing
the wall on Canfield Court, the strip of
lawn between the Law School and
Meyer Library.
In January 1976, however, the Com
mittee on Land and Building De
velopment rejected that site by a five to
three vote following a recommenda
tion from its Subcommittee on Out
door Art.
Last spring, the committee agreed to
the alternative Lomita Mall site, and
that proposal was approved by Presi
dent Richard Lyman.
Three years of work
Construction will culminate over
three years of work on the wall project,
Shaw said. Art Prof. Albert Elsen and
alumni with professional interest in
Albers discussed with the artist three
years ago the idea of donating a work
to the University. As a result, Albers
offered the wall design to the Univer

sity, according to Shaw.
Since that time, placement of the
work has been held up due to funding
problems, Shaw said. Funding will
come from the Albers Foundation and
some special alumni gifts, according
to Art Dept. Chairman Lorenz Eitner.
Originally, the sculpture was to be
erected near the museum, but "we felt
that was an out-of-the-way location for
this type of art," Shaw said.
Though work should be completed
within three months, Shaw said it
could take up to six months to finish
because of problems finding needed
materials.
Special granite
Albers specified a certain type of
granite which is quarried in Africa and
cut in Italy which has not been ordered
yet since plans are incomplete.
Though the University is trying to
substitute stone produced in Texas, it
may have to use the African stone.
There may be some delays getting it
here, Shaw said.
TheCanfield Court site had met with
protest from law students and faculty.
Their views prevailed, but Law School
Dean Charles Meyers said the objec
tions were "not aesthetic," Meyers
said. "It was a location problem."
Meyers was chairman of the com
mittee when the site determination
was made.
Shaw said he also felt objections to
the wall were linked to the proposed
location. Canfield Court is too small,
and the wall would have blocked side

lines of all buildings, he said.
The art piece "is not intellectually
out of order by the Physics Tank be
cause Albers' wall is a form of technol
ogy. Albers did not think in terms of
landscape and portrait," Eitner said.
"It is an architectural statement to
other architecture surrounding it, giv
ing the whole area refinement and pre
cision," Eitner commented.
Shaw said he "would be very sur
prised" if the wall became the object of
vandalism after work is completed. "I
think the emotionalism dealt only
with the Canfield Court site."
He added, however, that even if
vandalism does occur, the wall will be
coated with a material which will
allow for "easy cleaning."
But Senior Planner Robert Cairns
said a full-size wooden mock-up of the
wall erected last year on the court was
promptly torn down.
"Vandalism is a form of blackmail,"
Eitner said. "It is like someone proudly
announcing he's going to pollute the
environment."
He paralleled the threat of van
dalism to abuse in the museum. "If you
give in to threat, do you close the
museum? If society gets down to that
level, you get down to the fortress de
fense — a level we don't want to sink
to," he said.
Unlike the objections raised about
the Canfield Court site by Law School
students and faculty last year, opposi
tion to the plan appears absent in the
Physics Department.
