# Hammer & Coffin senators should be ousted

The recent antics of the Hammer and Coffin ASSU Senators are only a
particularly blatant example of their characteristic behavior in the senate all
year. To many it may seem like just "good clean fun"—if a bit childish. But
look again.
With respect to the latest incident, one can sympathize with Chris Mathe.
Being under fire in the Daily, justified or not, is no fun. Ask anyone who's
been there. When your professional performance and perhaps your im
mediate job prospects are being unjustly called into question, there is good
reason to be concerned.
False statements to the Daily are bad enough, unless confined to April
Fool's Day. Threatening notes and phone calls carry this malicious "joke"
beyond even the most beneficent limits of doubt.
Merely 'harmless pranks'?
These people have so little regard for the feelings of others, and de
monstrate so little awareness of their own insensitivity, that they compound
their maliciousness by claiming that those who are hurt by these "harmless
pranks" just "can't take a joke," thereby adding insult to their previous injury.
Make no mistake about it. This is one of the oldest copouts in the world. Do
something careless and hurtful, then claim that you were "only teasing,"
which neatly shifts the blame to the injured party and lets the offender off
without a pang of conscience—as long as you buy the rationale.
After all, "fun" is supposed to be a "good thing," and nobody likes a party
pooper. But injustice can take many guises. How would you view a judge's
dismissal of a rape threat on grounds that the offenders were "just kidding" ?
Destructive ridicule
Having served on the Council of Presidents (COP) this past year, I have
watched these senators with no little frustration as their so-called "humor"
has become increasingly destructive. No one ever sees the things which have
not been dealt with, precisely because they never come up.
Once burned, twice shy; those who have put work into projects which then
get cavalier treatment, or are ignored entirely and sometimes actually

ridiculed by the senate (which has ultimate constitutional authority over all
ASSU business), seldom care enough to try again. And that lesson is not lost
on others, who quit before they start.
A whole string of examples comes to mind, but it would distract from my
main point to cite cases. The point is that this "humor" is not only not funny
and a copout, but that it has so paralyzed the proper functioning of the ASSU
this year that many of us are extremely worried about the future of our student
association.
Endangered species
Precedents are being set as much by default as by design which could, if
continued, make productive student efforts within the ASSU so unrewarding

'not to take action against them
could prove a threat to the...future
of the ASSU....'

that they could become as extinct as the carrier pigeon.
One of the most obvious problems is that traditionally, ASSU senators have
viewed themselves, once elected, as unaccountable. No senator has ever been
recalled, and students have become so turned off to senatorial absurdities that
they just pay no heed any more.
But it is our senate and our organization. It could be and should be an
effective voice for student concerns. Without it, we have little access to
University decision-making.
The most reprehensible behavior on this year's ASSU Senate, symbolized

by this latest episode concerning the fraudulent campaign to recall Mat he, has
been initiated by the slate of 10 Hammer and Coffin senators which was
unwittingly installed by an indifferent and uninformed student electorate last
fall.
Three members of this group—including its leadership—are graduate stu
dents in the School of Law.
Grad students go first
Therefore it seems only fitting that the graduate community, which is
presumably in a position to view such matters from a somewhat more long
range and mature perspective, take the first action toward calling these
people to account for their behavior.
If such action is not taken, we should perhaps consider that an opposite
precedent is well on its way to becoming solidly established: that the ASSU
Senate is indeed a joke, and we need not expect it to be otherwise.
The recall procedure is clearly outlined in the ASSU Constitution. Fifteen
per cent of each senator's constituency (in this case, all graduate students)
must petition for a recall election.
This only permits the question to be debated of whether to remove these
graduate senators by the elective process. The election itself requires a two
thirds majority for recall, at which point that person's seat is taken by one of
the senatorial alternates elected in the fall.
Petitions out
Recall petitions currently are being circulated withing the graduate com
munity, and additonal forms are available through the ASSU offices (call
497-4331 and extra copies will be sent to you).
Please sign them, and if you are willing to take the trouble, help to circulate
them in your department.
Is this too much to ask, when the very effectiveness of our student associa
tion and the not inconsiderable amounts of our money are at stake?
I think not. I hope you agree. Your help will be greatly appreciated.
