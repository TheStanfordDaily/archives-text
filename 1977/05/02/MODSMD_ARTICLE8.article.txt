## OPINIONS University ignores racism 
### 
Bateson et al.

Black arm bands, leaflets, a vigil, a
hunger strike, guerilla theater, a
sleep-in, a rally, articles in the Daily. A
50 per cent infant mortality rate, de
solate Bantusans, a Big Brother pass
system, mass forced migration, "for
whites only." What is the nexus of
these two widely disparate sets of
phenomena? What is the Stanford
connection?
We feel Stanford could be doing
something about the horrendous con
ditions forced upon the blacks and
Colored in South Africa by the apar
theid system. Yet the University re
fuses. We are left with no choice but to
protest the horrendous insensitivity of
the administration and trustees.
In brief: the University owns
887,000 shares of stock worth over $40
million in U.S. corporations that have
stockholders who have called for their
corporations to not expand and/or
withdraw from South Africa.
The University has already allowed
three of the resolutions—those for
General Electric, Union Carbide and
Caltex—to pass by last week, having
merely abstained. These abstentions
were made in spite of the massive
community support favoring a yes
vote on the resolutions.
In a little over a week, 2500 people
have signed a petition supporting re
solutions. Innumerable campus or
ganizations have endorsed the peti
tion.
The ASSU Senate, the new Council
of Presidents and the Executive Com
mittee of the United Stanford
Employees all called for yes votes.
A SWOPSI class studying Univer
sity corporate investment responsibil
ity has submitted a detailed,
thoroughly-researched position paper
favoring affirmation of the resolutions.
Last weekend, we sent out a special
delivery mailing to all the members of
both the Board of Trustees' Committee
on Investments and the University
Commission on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR), informing them of all
these developments in the growing

community consensus in favor of the
resolutions.
Finally, we contacted Peter Bing,
president of the board. He voiced his
support for having the CIR carefully
examine our mailing to explore the
possibility of re-opening the issue. We
have just received word from Henry
Rowen, professor at the Business
School and chairman of the CIR, that
the commission has decided—despite
the demonstrated massive community
support—that the issue is not worth
reconsidering.
We find this callous refusal to be in
direct violation of the mandate the CIR
has to use community consensus as
one of the criteria in determining how
to vote on shareholder resolutions.
Indeed, Bing promised when he
spoke to protesters two weeks ago that
if we could show this consensus on the
South African resolutions, the issue
would be re-opened.
We have now gone through all the
legitimate channels in our attempt to
get this university, our university, to
use its power as a stockholder to aid in
bringing down the abhorrent apan<s.
theid system in South Africa. We have
been utterly ignored.
Our first vehicle for making ourse
lves heard is the wearing of black arm
bands. The arm bands specifically pro
test the University's abstention on the
three resolutions that have already
gone by, three opportunities for taking
action against apartheid that have al
ready been missed.
Before any more opportunities are
missed, we shall begin a round-the
clock vigil today in White Plaza. There
are shareholder resolutions coming to
a vote tomorrow, Wednesday and one
the next week.
Some of us feel that the University's
votes are important enough and that
the incredible oppression of blacks in
South Africa is serious enough to war
rant our sharing in some tiny part of
their suffering by beginning, along
with the vigil, a hunger strike.

Hunger is an everyday fact of life for
two-thirds of the South African blacks
who live below the nationally-defined
poverty line.
Finally, we will hold a rally tomor
row in White Plaza. This is an oppor
tunity for all those who are outraged by
apartheid and the University's inflexi
ble position on the the shareholder re
solutions to come out and voice their
protest.
