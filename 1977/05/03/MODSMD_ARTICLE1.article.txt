# PA Council imposes ban on arcades
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
The Palo Alto City Council passed
an ordinance 5-2 banning arcades and
regulating mechanical amusement
devices last night. Councilman Byron
Sher and Scott Carey opposed the
measure.
The city defines "arcade" as any es
tablishment open to the public: with
six or more mechanical amusement
devices. "Mechanical amusement de
vices" refers to any machine which,
upon the insertion of a coin, slug or
token in any slot or receptacle attached
to the machine may be operated as a
game.
Under the ordinance no more than
five amusement machines would be al
lowed in restaurants or businesses.
Machines which merely play re
corded music, provide a ride or dis
pense a uniform quantity of merchan
dise are not included under this defini
tion.
The ordinance permits any premises
to have up to five mechanical amuse
ment devices; however, both the pre
mises and the machines are subject to a
license, with a $25 fee for the premises
plus $5 per year.
Orderly regulation
The purpose of the ordinance is to
provide for the orderly regulation of
mechanical devices in the interests of
the public health, safety and welfare.
Denny Petrosian. a member of the
Coalition of Concerned Citizens (CCC)
which supported the ordinance,
explained, "We don't want arcades be
cause they attract really questionable
people who mingle with our kids."
The issue recently came to a head
because "a massage parlor operator
opened an amusement arcade and was
seen fraternizing with the Palo Alto
children," Petrosian explained.
The CCC protested against the vio
lent nature of the games, the effect of
arcades on surrounding neighbor
hoods and businesses, the criminal ac
tivity associated with the mechanical
amusement business and the expen
sive monitoring required of the city
police force.
The new ordinance, however, does
not prohibit violent pinball games as
the CCC recommended because the
city is not empowered to do so, said
city attorney Robert Booth. In accor
dance with the 1974 California Sup
reme Court ruling, the city cannot dis
tinguish between different types of
mechanical amusement devices — it
must either allow or prohibit all kinds.
Against ban
Tom Jordan, an employe of Atari, a
company manufacturing electronic
video and coin-operated games, spoke
against the ban on arcades. He said he
felt the other regulatory aspects of the
ordinance were sufficient to meet thr
problem.
Me claimed the city council had not
been presented with concrete evi
dence proving the harmful impact of
arcades on the community or arcades'
connection with organized crime.
"There are no facts on which you can
ban a lawful business." he contended.
Carey, who opposed the motion, ag
reed with Jordan. Hv passing the ordi
nance "we eliminate what might be a
perfectly legitimate business on the
basis of no evidence. We're buying
litigation (from game companies)," he
claimed.
"The city gets into trouble when it
reacts without thinking through the
issue clearly," he said. The council re
jected 2-5 Carey's motion to delay the
decision.

The CCC protested against the vio
lent nature of the games, the effect of
arcades on surrounding neighbor
hoods and businesses, the criminal ac
tivity associated with the mechanical
amusement business and the expen
sive monitoring required of the city
police force.
The new ordinance, however, does
not prohibit violent pinball games as
the CCC recommended because the
city is not empowered to do so, said
city attorney Robert Booth. In accor
dance with the 1974 California Sup
reme Court ruling, the city cannot dis
tinguish between different types of
mechanical amusement devices — it
must either allow or prohibit all kinds.
Against ban
Tom Jordan, an employe of Atari, a
company manufacturing electronic
video and coin-operated games, spoke
against the ban on arcades. He said he
felt the other regulatory aspects of the
ordinance were sufficient to meet thr
problem.
Me claimed the city council had not
been presented with concrete evi
dence proving the harmful impact of
arcades on the community or arcades'
connection with organized crime.
"There are no facts on which you can
ban a lawful business." he contended.
Carey, who opposed the motion, ag
reed with Jordan. Hv passing the ordi
nance "we eliminate what might be a
perfectly legitimate business on the
basis of no evidence. We're buying
litigation (from game companies)," he
claimed.
"The city gets into trouble when it
reacts without thinking through the
issue clearly," he said. The council re
jected 2-5 Carey's motion to delay the
decision.
The Palo Alto City Council passed
an ordinance 5-2 banning arcades and
regulating mechanical amusement
devices last night. Councilman Byron
Sher and Scott Carey opposed the
measure.
The city defines "arcade" as any es
tablishment open to the public: with
six or more mechanical amusement
devices. "Mechanical amusement de
vices" refers to any machine which,
upon the insertion of a coin, slug or
token in any slot or receptacle attached
to the machine may be operated as a
game.
Under the ordinance no more than
five amusement machines would be al
lowed in restaurants or businesses.
Machines which merely play re
corded music, provide a ride or dis
pense a uniform quantity of merchan
dise are not included under this defini
tion.
The ordinance permits any premises
to have up to five mechanical amuse
ment devices; however, both the pre
mises and the machines are subject to a
license, with a $25 fee for the premises
plus $5 per year.
Orderly regulation
The purpose of the ordinance is to
provide for the orderly regulation of
mechanical devices in the interests of
the public health, safety and welfare.
Denny Petrosian. a member of the
Coalition of Concerned Citizens (CCC)
which supported the ordinance,
explained, "We don't want arcades be
cause they attract really questionable
people who mingle with our kids."
The issue recently came to a head
because "a massage parlor operator
opened an amusement arcade and was
seen fraternizing with the Palo Alto
children," Petrosian explained.
