The Stanford Committee on
Hunger feels that in the midst of
the present controversy over
American corporate investment
policies in South Africa, a large
proportion of the Stanford com

the plight of the millions of men.
women and children who are
suffering from hunger inu pov
erty in black South Africa
We reemphasize that the prob
lem in South Africa is an ethical
one. created by political,
economic and social injustice. In
South Africa, as in most of the
developing world, a maldis
tribution of wealth and disre
gard for human rights leads to
widespread suffering.
However, the South African
policy of apartheid and. specifi
cally. the banishment of blacks
to the Bantustans, actively in
tensifies hunger and poverty in a
unique way.
Forced move
The Bantustans are numerous
disconnected reserves (compris
ing .3 per cent of South Africa's
land) to which millions of black
South Africans have been and
will be forceablv moved. How
ever, the Bantusta ns are ecologi -
cally incapable of providing an
adequate subsistence diet for the
dense population already forced
to be there.
The resources are too meager,
the level of education of blacks
too low and their skills too
scarce for any development to
occur there.
Therefore, against all his dig
nity, the black South African
male has to leave his family and
sell his labor hundreds of miles
away in the white man's city, or
in the deadly mine shafts to that
he won't have to see his own
children starve.
The concept of migrant labor

divides families. White South
Africa has no use for black
women and children except as to
ensure a steady flow of un
employed male labor.
There is no doubt about the
motives of South Africa's
policies. The white South Afri
can population reaps profits
from exploiting its black labor
force. Transnational corpora
tions reap profits from this
system. Stanford University
reaps profits from this economic
system.
. . . think about it . . .
While South Africa exports
cash crops to Europe (apples,
grapes, pears, peaches, apricots),
its black population suffers from
numerous nutritional diseases,
kwashiorkor, the severe protein
deficiency disease, is 300 times
more prevalent in blackchildren
than white, and the incidence is
increas.ng.
Malnutrition
Marasmus, or protein-calorie
malnutrition, will affect one
fifth of all black South Africans
in their lifetime. Xerophthalmia
and Pellegra are two other seri
ous deficiency diseases, striking
mostly children.
Although South Africa has
historically produced enough
food to export, nevertheless, the
women and children of the Ban
tustans cannot procure suffi
cient means for their own survi
val. Fifty per cent of the children
of-the Bantustans die before the
age of five.
Not all South African blacks
have deficient diets, however.
Strong, young black male work
ers are well fed in order to in
crease productivity for the white
man's industries. Healthy black
males keep the economy of
South Africa running, yet are not
paid enough for any capital ac

cumulation on their own which
could go either toward
adequately feeding their chil
dren or toward development of
human and agricultural re
sources.
As the unemployment rate is
incredibly high (23 per cent) and
as their education is slight, no
organizing for better wages or for
a bigher standard of living js
conceivable. The government
ruthlessly restricts blacks' abil
ity to fight for themselves.
Suffering
Hence the conditions of in
tense suffering are far beyond

any point of "crisis," and are
growing steadily worse. The
policies of the government per
petuate the tragedy. Whereas
foreign economic and political
pressure may influence the gov
ernment policies, no direct ec
nomic intervention can fully or
even substantially compensate
for the worsening conditions.
We urge the entire Stanford
community (faculty, administra
tion, and students) to take a
stand ontheSouth African issue.

South Africa, as in most of the

Forced move
The Bantustans are numerous
disconnected reserves (compris
ing .3 per cent of South Africa's
land) to which millions of black
South Africans have been and
will be forceablv moved. How
ever, the Bantusta ns are ecologi -
cally incapable of providing an
adequate subsistence diet for the
dense population already forced
to be there.
The resources are too meager,
the level of education of blacks
too low and their skills too
scarce for any development to
occur there.
Therefore, against all his dig

male has to leave his family and
sell his labor hundreds of miles

children starve.
The concept of migrant labor

divides families. White South
Africa has no use for black
women and children except as to

There is no doubt about the
