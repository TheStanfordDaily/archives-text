# Taiwanese students protest
## 'Spying' report humiliating 
### 
Mien Shih

After reading the three articles
about Taiwanese students
"spies" by Kurt Cobb (Daily,
April 27-29), I was astonished,
disappointed and deeply
humiliated.
As a graduate student from
Taiwan who is enjoying the
quiet and friendly atmosphere
here at Stanford, I found Cobb's
report severely disturbing.
To the best of my knowledge,
there is no campus "spying" at
Stanford, and I feel no "tense but
quiet struggle among Taiwanese
students" of which Cobb is so
sure is here.
Close relationships
We Taiwanese students here
sharea very close, inspiring rela
tionship among us and we are
always willing to help each
other. There is an old Chinese
saying: "A wise man should be
able to judge and stop, instead of

passing on a rumor.
I have never heard of the so
called "campus informers," but
Cohh's report certainly helps in
starting and spreading a story, of
which he himself admits there is
no hard evidence, in an incredi
bly efficient manner.
I feel very disappointed to see
his story about the "struggle" of
which we have no idea at all.
About the Daily survey, origi
nally I endorsed the letter writ
ten by Jer-Hon Lin (Daily. Feb.
25) because I held the same opin
ion.
However, when I received the
survey, I declined to respond
simply because I considered it
ridiculous for me to answer
those irrelevant but very offend
ing questions.
Also, the survey had seven dif
ferent questions, but the pub
lished result (Daily. April 29)

was an oversimplification.
I urge Cobb to release the full
details and statistics for each in
dividual question on the survey.
In addition, he may want to in
terview more Taiwanese stu
dents if he is really serious about
presenting an unbiased picture
of our opinion toward this sub
ject.
I believe that we Taiwanese
students would agree that we
may freely criticize and openly
discuss the issues we concern in
our government both at home
and abroad. I am worried that
Cobb's story may create frustrat
ing fear and suspicion among us
which would greatly repress the
spirit of this open ciriticism we
now have.
