## Redwood fight 
###

The controversy over
recently-introduced legislation
to expand Redwood National
Park from 58,000 to 132,000
acres is the most recent manifes
tation of the persistent battle be
tween industry and environ
mentalists.
The bill, introduced by Rep.
Philip Burton (D-Ca.) prop
oses adding a large area of red
woods to the park and to estab
lish an upstream park-protection
zone, where the land may be
managed for protection of the

park, water and trees
downstream.
Strong opposition has come
from loggers, who fear that the
expansion could mean a loss of
up to 2200 jobs in an area where
unemployment is already .4 per
cent.
Expansion justified
From the environmentalist
standpoint, the proposed expan
sion is certainly justified. Log
ging on the steep slopes just
beyond the present park bound
ary is causing erosion that seri
ously threatens the redwoods.
There is also the realistic fear
of overcutting by the lumber
companies, as well as numerous
complaints of buzz saws and
crashing timber noise by park
users.
As Burton points out, the situ
ation is grave enough so that if
nothing is done, the money and
effort spent on establishing the
existing park will be wasted.
On the other hand, the argu
ment presented by the loggers is
equally legitimate. Eighty per
cent of the economy around
Eureka depends on Sequoia
sempirvirens, the proud Califor
nia coastal redwood that grows
to be the tallest living thing in
the world.
Forced to succumb to conser
vationists in 1968, when the
redwood park was created, the
loggers are even more reluctant
to accept an expansion which
would further jeopardize their
jobs.
Recent protests have included
all2-truck convoy assault on San
Francisco and signs bearing the
slogan: "Sierra Club â€” Kiss my
Axe."
Protests not new
The controversy over the
proposed expansion of Redwood
National Park is certainly not un-

ique to this situation. Similar
problems are encountered in
nearly every debate between in
dustry and conservationists over
issues of environmental preser
vation.
Traditionally in the past, each
particular struggle has been sol
ved by local, state or federal gov
ernment in such a manner as to
create a clear winner and loser.
Father mother nature is ad
versely affected, or someone is
out of a job.
Clearly, this strategy of solv
ing environmental problems
needs to be improved upon, for it
only serves to promote public
animosity toward conser
vationists, whose efforts are cer
tainly commendable.
Environmental preservation
should ideally be a team effort
supported by all Americans,
rather than the goal of
"backpacking hippies and their
naked girlfriends," the label re
cently given to users of the Red
wood National Park by a logger.
This ideal may be achieved
only by a requirement that all fu
ture environmental legislation
include provisions for those
I ikely to be adversely affected by
its passage.
In the current Redwood Na
tional Park controversy such
provisions might include a prog
ram of job retraining to teach
new forestry skills with guaran
teed maintenance of individual
income at former levels.
Loggers might be paid for
planting trees ratherthan forcut
ting them a situation which
would not only please the Sierra
Club and similar organizations
but probably increase their
membership.
