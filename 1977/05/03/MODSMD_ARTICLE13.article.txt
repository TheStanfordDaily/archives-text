# Trustees should reconsider vote
## 
### 
Tranquada et al.

We, the undersigned staffers
and editors of the Stanford
Daily, protest the decision of the
Board of Trustees on April 12 to
abstain on proxies calling for re
duced investment in South Af
rica. Moreover, we are distressed
by the editorial of the Daily ap
pearing on April 20, 1977 which

supported the proxy abstentions
of the Board of Trustees.
We urge the Board of Trustees
to reconsider their previous vote
and to vote "yes" on the resolu
tions, for the reasons given be
low.
There are three principal
criteria in University investment
policy which, if satisfied, re
quire a yes vote: the undesirable
acts or effects of the company
must be substantial; substantial
consensus exists in the com
munity on the undesirability of
the acts in question; and the
economic costs to the University
of taking action be commensu
rate with the probable effects of
that action.
All of these criteria have been
conclusively fulfilled.
The University owns 887,000
shares of stock, valued at $40
million in nine U.S. companies
with major holdings in South
Africa.
These companies, all of which
have faced shareholder proxy re
solutions calling for non
expansion or withdrawal of in
vestments in South Africa, con
tribute extensively to the stabil
ity and strength of the South Af
rican economy; that is, they pro

vide critical revenue for the
military and police forces that
preserve apartheid and enforce
the system of racial segregation.
Just this year, the budget for
these armed forces reached $2
billion, a 21 per cent increase.
In turn, South Africa uses
these forces to deny the native
black community the right to
vote, to collectively bargain, to
choose their permanent resi
dence, to protest their dis
criminatory wages.
Thus, foreign investment is
doubly harmful: they provide
funds for the apartheid system
and constitute a powerful incen
tive for the determined and
brutal suppression of labor un
ions, democratic voting and
political protest.
It should come as no surprise
that Bayers Narde. an Af
rikaaner, head of the Christian
Institute in Johannesburg, said:
"End investments." Only if in
vestments are reduced or termi
nated will the acts
or effects of these companies be
mitigated or eliminated.
The second criteria, the pre
sence of substantial consensus
on the undesirable effects of
foreign investment, has been

fully met. Over 2500 students
and staff have signed a petition
calling for "yes" votes and a
meeting with the trustees; 80 fa
culty members have signed a
similar petition; over 20 campus
organizations have supported a
positive vote (including the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the
ASSU Senate, the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee represent
ing 16 campus groups, United
Stanford Employees, the Law
School Civil Rights Research
Council and the Black Caucus).
With the increasing political
and economic isolation of South
Africa, the costly militarization
of the country for internal and
external conflict, the growing
arms embargo. South Africa is a
poor place for the prudent inves
tor.
It is unusual for moral princi
ples and economic concerns to
yield a similar conclusion: in
vestment in South Africa must
be reduced. The University
should follow its own invest
ment policy and vote yes on the
proxy resolutions.

and editors of the Stanford
Daily, protest the decision of the
Board of Trustees on April 12 to
abstain on proxies calling for re
duced investment in South Af
rica. Moreover, we are distressed
by the editorial of the Daily ap
pearing on April 20, 1977 which

supported the proxy abstentions
of the Board of Trustees.
We urge the Board of Trustees
to reconsider their previous vote
and to vote "yes" on the resolu
tions, for the reasons given be
low.
There are three principal
criteria in University investment
policy which, if satisfied, re
quire a yes vote: the undesirable
acts or effects of the company
must be substantial; substantial
consensus exists in the com
munity on the undesirability of
the acts in question; and the
economic costs to the University
of taking action be commensu
rate with the probable effects of
that action.
All of these criteria have been
conclusively fulfilled.
The University owns 887,000
shares of stock, valued at $40
million in nine U.S. companies
with major holdings in South
Africa.
These companies, all of which
have faced shareholder proxy re
solutions calling for non
expansion or withdrawal of in
vestments in South Africa, con
tribute extensively to the stabil
ity and strength of the South Af
rican economy; that is, they pro

vide critical revenue for the
military and police forces that
preserve apartheid and enforce
the system of racial segregation.
Just this year, the budget for
these armed forces reached $2
billion, a 21 per cent increase.
In turn, South Africa uses
these forces to deny the native
black community the right to
vote, to collectively bargain, to
choose their permanent resi
dence, to protest their dis
criminatory wages.
Thus, foreign investment is
doubly harmful: they provide
funds for the apartheid system
and constitute a powerful incen
tive for the determined and
brutal suppression of labor un
ions, democratic voting and
political protest.
It should come as no surprise
that Bayers Narde. an Af
rikaaner, head of the Christian
Institute in Johannesburg, said:
"End investments." Only if in
vestments are reduced or termi
nated will the acts
or effects of these companies be
mitigated or eliminated.
The second criteria, the pre
sence of substantial consensus
on the undesirable effects of
foreign investment, has been

fully met. Over 2500 students
and staff have signed a petition
calling for "yes" votes and a
meeting with the trustees; 80 fa
culty members have signed a
similar petition; over 20 campus
organizations have supported a
positive vote (including the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the
ASSU Senate, the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee represent
ing 16 campus groups, United
Stanford Employees, the Law
School Civil Rights Research
Council and the Black Caucus).
With the increasing political
and economic isolation of South
Africa, the costly militarization
of the country for internal and
external conflict, the growing
arms embargo. South Africa is a
poor place for the prudent inves
tor.
It is unusual for moral princi
ples and economic concerns to
yield a similar conclusion: in
vestment in South Africa must
be reduced. The University
should follow its own invest
ment policy and vote yes on the
proxy resolutions.
