## Ballet to open new program 
### 
In 1947, George Halanchine
choreographed a new work, set
to Bizet's Palais de Crist(d (later
changed to Sym/)hony in C),
specially for the dancers of the
Faris Opera company, and his
successful transformation of the
company raised such a
chauvinistic furor among the
Parisians that one cable read,
"You have probably seen that
you have really started some
thing. French national pride has
been stung to the quick. I should
not be surprised if you hear from
the State Department."
But after the last program of
the season, the French writer
and critic. Leandre Vail let, by
now seduced and mollified,
wrote of Symphony in C in Car
re/our: "One feels a little like the
spectator of a brilliant display of
fireworks who returns silently
home, at night, the eyes kissed
by an inner vision through
which pass emeralds, rubies,
and, above all. a black diamond.
One asks oneself with a some
what indiscreet curiosity: And
now what?"
Symphony in C wil 1 be offered
in the San Francisco Ballet's
forthcoming program along with
Moves, Songs of Mohler, and a

pas de deux on May 5,15,17 and
21 at the War Memorial Opera
House. It realizes Balanchine's
essential desire to move people
to music; its abstract content and
form derive solely from the
music's impetus.
Bizet's score, composed when
he was only 17, has four move
ments, each of which has its own
principal female and male dan
cers and corps de ballet. Toward
the end. the various groups
combine for a magnificent,
climactic summation of the
score's four themes. (Lew Chris
tensen, co-director of the San
Francisco Ballet, was in the
fourth movement of the United
States premiere in 1948.)
In contrast to Symphony in C.
Jerome Robbins' ballet. Moves, is
a ballet in silence about relation
ships. First presented in 1959, it
severs the guidance of
dynamics, tempo, and mood
which music usually establishes
for us. Movement alone speaks
eloquently of human relation
ships and with no music, tfie
dancers seem directed by their
own rhythmic impulses.
Jerome Robbins, a native New
Yorker, is, along with Balan
chine, one of the New York Citv

Ballet's resident choreog
raphers. Moves is the first Rob
bins ballet to be given to the San
Francisco company and it is an
honor to start with a ballet ut
terly dependent on the dancers
for its success.
Michael Smuin's Songs of
Mahler as well as a yet un
specified pas de deux will com
prise the rest of the evening's
performance.

mances scheduled for May 5, 15, 17 and 21, will include pieces choreographed by George
Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Michael Smuin.
In 1947, George Halanchine
choreographed a new work, set
to Bizet's Palais de Crist(d (later
changed to Sym/)hony in C),
specially for the dancers of the
Faris Opera company, and his
successful transformation of the
company raised such a
chauvinistic furor among the
Parisians that one cable read,
"You have probably seen that
you have really started some
thing. French national pride has
been stung to the quick. I should
not be surprised if you hear from
the State Department."
But after the last program of
the season, the French writer
and critic. Leandre Vail let, by
now seduced and mollified,
wrote of Symphony in C in Car
re/our: "One feels a little like the
spectator of a brilliant display of
fireworks who returns silently
home, at night, the eyes kissed
by an inner vision through
which pass emeralds, rubies,
and, above all. a black diamond.
One asks oneself with a some
what indiscreet curiosity: And
now what?"
Symphony in C wil 1 be offered
in the San Francisco Ballet's
forthcoming program along with
Moves, Songs of Mohler, and a

pas de deux on May 5,15,17 and
21 at the War Memorial Opera
House. It realizes Balanchine's
essential desire to move people
to music; its abstract content and
form derive solely from the
music's impetus.
Bizet's score, composed when
he was only 17, has four move
ments, each of which has its own
principal female and male dan
cers and corps de ballet. Toward
the end. the various groups
combine for a magnificent,
climactic summation of the
score's four themes. (Lew Chris
tensen, co-director of the San
Francisco Ballet, was in the
fourth movement of the United
States premiere in 1948.)
In contrast to Symphony in C.
Jerome Robbins' ballet. Moves, is
a ballet in silence about relation
ships. First presented in 1959, it
severs the guidance of
dynamics, tempo, and mood
which music usually establishes
for us. Movement alone speaks
eloquently of human relation
ships and with no music, tfie
dancers seem directed by their
own rhythmic impulses.
Jerome Robbins, a native New
Yorker, is, along with Balan
chine, one of the New York Citv

Ballet's resident choreog
raphers. Moves is the first Rob
bins ballet to be given to the San
Francisco company and it is an
honor to start with a ballet ut
terly dependent on the dancers
for its success.
Michael Smuin's Songs of
Mahler as well as a yet un
specified pas de deux will com
prise the rest of the evening's
performance.
