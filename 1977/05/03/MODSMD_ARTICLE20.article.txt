# Symphony/andrew m. moravcsik
## Guest conductor in poor show 
### 
Last Wednesday, I attended
the worst San Francisco Sym
phony performance of the year.
The program itself was intrigu
ing; the Brahms Symphony No.
1, Schonberg's Verklarte Nacht,
and Rameau's Overture to
"Aais" should have pleased
anyone. The problem also did
not lie with the orchestra — the
playing was not inspiring, but it
was adequate. No, the fiasco
must be attributed to young
guest conductor Christoph Es
chenbach.
Eschenbach is, of course, a
world famous pianist. A favorite
of San Francisco audiences (he
played Beethoven's Concerto
No. 1 here earlier this year), he
maintains an extensive discog
raphy on the Deutsche Gram
mophon label. Evidently, he is
attempting to follow the many
pianists who have gone on to
greater fame as conductors. He
has a long way to go.
Eschenbach's interpretation of
the Rameau overture betrayed
his nervousness. Astonishingly
quick, edgy and mechanical, Es
chenbach's rendition destroyed
the continuity of the work and
transformed the strikingly origi
nal orchestration into a brittle,
unpleasant timbre.
Young love
The evening continued with
Arnold Schonberg's ode to
young love: Verklarte Nacht.
Scored for string orchestra, this
tone-poem's warm harmonies
and lush chromaticism betray
the influence of the late Wagner
operas.
Instead of flowing naturally,
Eschenbach's interpretation was
forced and awkward. This
created a plausible effect in the

sections describing emotional
anguish, but it shattered the
more delicate parts.
The solos were smooth and
moving (congratulations to sub
stitute concertmaster Delmar
Pettys, violinist Geraldine Lam
boley and principal second vio
lin Daniel kobalaika) but the
tufti were muddy.
1 can't understand why Es
chenbach chose Brahms' First
Symphony to finish the prog
ram.
Brahms is relaxed; Eschen
bach was edgy. Brahms plumbs
limitless depths; Eschenbach
was a superficial conductor.
Brahms is difficult; Eschenbach
was inexperienced. Brahms is a
romantic Viennese; Eschenbach
is a classic Prussian.
The first few measures of
Brahms' First are almost unique
in their ability to sweep the lis
tener away. Brahms can't wait:
the introduction, punctuated
with solemn drumbeats, is warm
and full, and, with its immediate
modulations, extremely sig
nificant.
Instead of playing solemn

drumbeats, the tympani came in
as in the 1812 Overture, com
pletely overshadowing the
string harmonies, and ruining
one of the finest moments in the
symphonic repertoire.
Moreover, the opening tempo
was too slow. Eschenbach wan
dered aimlessly among various
tempos during the performance,
usually to the detriment of
Brahms.
Survival
Eschenbach survived the sec
ond and third movements
mainly because they are not so
significant musically. Still, he
was unable to get a decent piano
out of the orchestra (although he
did try), the music lacked sub
tlety of phrasing or dynamics,
and the meandering tempos
were generally too slow.
Theudogio section that opens
the monumental finale was the
highlight of the evening. Es
chenbach picked an effective
tempo and, although he forgot
about the important crescendo
decresce ndo couplets, the
somber, ominous spirit came
through.

After the chorale, when the
joyous, reconciling C major
theme is supposed to flood the
somber mood with sunlight, Es
chenbach chose a ponderous
tempo, plowing through the
climax of the entire work. Realiz
ing his mistake, Eschenhach
gradually increased the tempo
(creating some startling ac
celerandos) and by the second
time through, he had reached an
adequate tempo — too late.
Between this point and the
coda, the performance disinteg
rated into a bombastic shouting
match. Eschenbach encouraged
everyone to play too loudly,
until the winds were over
blowing and the strings were
over-bowing.
Einally, Eschenbach came
crashing into the coda. By this
time he had sped up the tempo
and turned up the volume
beyond any standards of de
cency, let alone musicianship.
Leaving the Opera House, I re
solved to listen to nothing but
quiet Mozart string quartets for a
week.
