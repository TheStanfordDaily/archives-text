# 'As You Like It' to open
## 
### 
When Shakespeare's Twelfth
Night opened as the inaugural
production in Memorial Au
ditorium in 1937, the audience
applauded as much for the large
stage and plush red velvet opera
seats of the hall as for the pro
duction.
When the Stanford Drama De
partment marks the 40th an
niversary of the auditorium next
week with Shakespeare's As You
Like It, it will be staged in the
Little Theatre because the
show's designer feels the small
space best reflects the intimate
world of the play.
Shakespeare's deceptively
simply pastoral drama deals

with deep problems while main
taining a facade of bantering
clowns and witty chatter.
The current production of As
You Like It is directed by Leigh
Sealy, a third-year doctoral can
didate in drama. William Ed
delman designed both the cos
tumes and the sets.
The role of Rosalind will be
played by Linda Morrissey and
her true love, Orlando, by David
Bryant.
As You Like It will be per
formed May 11 to 14 and May 17
to 21 at 8 p.m. in the Little
Theatre. Tickets are on saleat the
Tresidder ticket office and major
ticket outlets.
