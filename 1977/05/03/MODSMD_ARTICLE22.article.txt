## Rare treat from Fine Arts 
### 
Last Sunday and Tuesday, au
diences packed Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium for a rare treat: the
complete Mozart Viola Quintets,
played by the Fine Arts Quartet
with Walter Trainpler. guest vio
list.
These six quintets — scored
for two violins, two violas, and
cello — present Mozart at his
finest. The final four quintets
were written after his string
quartets, and the differences go
beyond the mere addition of a
viola. Ranking with the late
operas and the final concerti in
their emotional insight, these
works are among Mozart's most
mature personal statements.
The Fine Arts Quartet, one of
America's leading ensembles,
was joined by Walter Trampler,
an unsurpassed viola soloist. In
the 19505. Trampler joined the
Budapest Quartet for a now
legendary recording of these
pieces.
Two styles
There are two styles of playing
the Mozart Quintets — the
"European" and the "Ameri
can." European groups are gen
erally more relaxed, concentrat
ing on warmth and contempla

tive phrasing, whereas their
American counterparts create
faster, more exciting interpreta
tions, emphasizing classic
crispness. The Fine Arts (their
rendition of the E-flat Quintet
excluded) compromised bet
ween the two styles, with a warm
but thin tone, quick tempi in the
fast movements, but romantic in
terpretations of the slow move
ments.
Both performances were satis
fying, but uneven. Least memor
able were the two early quintets:
the B-flat Quintet (K. 174) and
the C minor Quintet (k. 406).
Both lacked depth. The phrasing
seemed crude while mild into
nation problems (especially in
Leonard Sorkin's E-string work)
and general muddiness
obscured the inner voices.
The ensemble continued with
a confident and effortless per
formance of the D Major Quintet
(K. 593). The passionate lonely
adagio was marred only by the
weak opening cello arpeggio,
which was corrected the second
time through.
Balanced
The C Major Quintet (K. 515),
one of the most popular of the

set, was given a balanced and
smooth performance. Especially
lovely was the Minuet/Trio, a
dance movement with depth and
warmth unparalleled in the
chamber music repetoire.
The G Minor Quintet (K. 516)
has always been controversial.
The first three movements (and
the adagio introduction to the
fourth) exhibit passionate per
sonal anguish, in the dark G
minor mood of the Symphony
No. 40. Paradoxically, the gay,
final allegro is amazingly inno
cent, seemingly unaware of the
dark past.
Those who champion Beeth
oven's monumental spiritual
finales have asserted that this
solution to the anguish of the
first movements is too easy. Al
though most musicians (as op
posed to "philosophers of
music") disagree, it is neverthe
less necessary to highlight the
contrast by drawing out the
pathos in the early movements
and then creating a truly gay
finale. Except in the muted
adagios, the Fine Arts was un
able to create convincingly grim
passion and the gay finale was
likewise blunted.
The final work, the E-flat
Quintet (K. 614), was the high
light of the entire series.
The group exchanged their
previous style for a wild frenzied
spirit in this piece. The tempos
were quick, the playing was in
cisive and bright and the style
was energetic.
A final note for violists: Tram
pier played an Amati viola,
carved a generation before
Stradivarius for the Bourbon
Kings of France.
