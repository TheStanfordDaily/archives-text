## Jazz Legend Stephane Grappelli Shines at Music Hall 
### 
Stephane Grappelli had the
audience spellbound in San
Francisco's Great American
Music Hall Wednesday night.
The French grand master of the
jazz violin worked magic with
his lucid playing style and
boyish grin.
After a short introduction by
the Diz Dizley Trio (featuring
Diz Dizley and John Etheridge
on acoustic guitars and Brian
Torff on stand-up bass), Grap
pelli, 69, came on stage to a
warm round of applause from
the full house. I'laying the first
few bars a ca pel la, Grappelli
showed that his agility and style
have done nothing but improve
since his first recordings in the
19305.
Grapelli, a self-taught musi
cian, first started playing jazz
violin with a pit crew in a movie
theatre in his pre-teens. He
moved from the movie circuit to
the night club circuit where he
teamed up with gypsy guitarist
Django Reinhardt to form the
Quintet of the Hot Club of Fr
ance. It was with Reinhardt that
Grappelli learned the style that
he uses today.
Although the first set was
short (one hour and 15 minutes),
Grappelli and his trio of four
years managed to pack the per
formance with a refreshing vari
ety of jazz pieces. Songs such as,
"1 Only Have Eyes for You" and
"As Time Goes By" gave Grap
pelli the room to rhapsodize,

creating sweet melancholy tones
as well as light, fluid solos. His
improvisational talents were ex
posed further in an adaptation of
Stevie Wonder's "You Are the
Sunshine of My Life." which
also featured an excellent solo by
John Etheridge.
Etheridge got a pat on the
cheek from Grappelli as well as
sustained applause from the au
dience for his solo efforts.
Dizley, on the other hand,
seemed to be laboring in his
guitar solos and his constant

humming during the pieces
proved bothersome at times.
"I used to be twice as fast, 20
years ago." Dizley lamented
after the first set.
But Dizley was able to get a
good rapport with the audience
in his introduction and in his
steady rhythm playing which is
necessary for this type of jazz.
Yet, it was Grappelli's delicate
variations in tone and beat that
seized the house's attention.
Dressed in flared pants, flo
wered shirt and tennis shoes.

Grappelli bowed gracefully to a
standing ovation after the first
set of songs. "I have to give my
friends a rest," he said in a quiet
French accent, and placing his
violin on the piano, he pro
ceeded to play an extended
piano solo, featuring an alternat
ing bass in a boogie woogie
rhythm.
The trio came back on to play
one more number then. Grap
pelli, with his unchanging grin,
blew a kiss to the audience and
walked off stage to another
standing ovation.

Grappelli's short but varied set was packed with the type of jazz which earned musicians on the
