## Radio Choir a boon to adolescents 
### 
Midnight shows, like Sunday
matinees, are time fillers to oc
cupy a couple of vacant hours
with entertainment. Generally
the quality of that entertainment
is less important than its availa
bility. regularity and discount
price.
Sitting in the audience of the
High Wire Radio Choir Show at
the New Varsity Theatre last
Saturday night. I got the feeling
that the noisy raucous crowd
around me consisted of 80 per
cent stoned Palo Alto teenagers
who were trying desperately to
postpone for a few hours the in
evitable return to their parents'
houses.
The remaining 20 percent had
to have been friends of the per
formers.
The High Wire Radio Choir is
billed as a live, irreverent com
edy act. something along the
lines of The National Lampoon
Radio Hour. The members of the
four-man, two-woman team are
allegedly newscasters and
deejays from kSJO radio in San
Jose.
The production was unprofes
sional. which is understandable,
given the youth of the team (one

of the publicity people, of which
there were about a dozen, told
me it was their second perfor
mance). Spotlights missed, mic
rophones failed, and two people
repeatedly interrupted things bv
vaulting across the stage during
the show.
But even these technical dif
ficulties cannot be blamed for
the group's failure to elicit a
laugh from anyone who wasn't
stoned or adolescent. The mate
rial, satirizing popular culture
(sex. drugs and all those neat
things), was neither humorous
nor well-delivered. Some exam
ples:
—in a sketch on "How to pick up
girls," the adviser suggests try
ing the modern approach, say
ing. "In 40 years we have gone
from love them and leave them
to freak them and tweak them."
—in a spoof on male-female rela
tions: "You don't have to have
sex to have a meaningful rape."
Two sketches were clever, one
a take-off on those record bar
gain commercials on'television,
with Frank Valley singing, "My
Last Rendezvous," "Won't You
Rendezvous With Me?" "Help
Me, Rendezvous" . . . etc.

Another involved a parody of
Erhard Seminar Training (EST),
the self-realization method, and
was called DTB (Deadhead Ter
minal Braining).
But unfortunately, most of the
show played upon the teenage
crowd's willingness to giggle
with guilt at assaults on their in
dulgence in the evils of sex.

drugs and junk food. The mere
mention of pizza-flavored ice
cream brought inexplicable
peals of laughter.
Fine idea for the New Varsity
to keep kids off the streets by of
fering them late night enter
tainment. but it might be more
productive and enjoyable if they
would stick with films.
