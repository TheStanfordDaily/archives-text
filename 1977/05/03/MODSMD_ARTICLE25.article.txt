## 'Welcome to L.A.' an inhospitable imitation 
### 
Welcome To L A
Produced by Robert Altman, written and di
rected by Alan Rudolph. Photographed by
Dave Myers. Starring Keith Carradine. Saiy Kel
lerman. Geraldine Chaplin. Harvey Keitel,
Lauren Hutton, Vrveca Lindfors Sissy Spacek,
Denver Pyle. John Considlne. Richard Baskin
MPAA rating: PG.
Alan Rudolph. Protege to
Robert Altman, director of
Nashville and Buffalo Bill and
the Indians. Altman. prince of
obscurity. Rudolph, pretender to
the throne. Rudolph, screenwri
ter of Breakfast of Champions,
Buffalo Bill and his first directo
rial effort. Welcome To L.A.
Heralded as the brightest direc

torial star since Martin Scorsese.
In actuality, the brightest direc
torial star since Peter Bog
danovich.
Welcomc To L.A. Reminiscent
of Nashville. Based on
Nashville. Exactly like
Nashville. Only not as smooth.
To believe Rudolph's vision of
Los Angeles, it is just like
Nashville. With the same plastic
people. The same rootless mig
rants. Adrift. Will the next film
be Topeka, a dissection of the
dissatisfaction of the agribusi
ness community in the Mid

west?
Welcome To L.A., a compen
dium of bad habits only made
acceptable by Altman because
he is a master. Rudolph is an in
fant playing with blocks. His
film, self-indulgent, unoriginal,
fragmented. Above all frag
mented. Except for the scenes of
Richard Baskin, the composer.
In Nashville, Haven Hamilton
(Henry Gibson) threw Baskin out
of a recording session for si ngi ng
like a frog. Here the accusation
comes out in full force. Baskin
does indeed sing like a frog. A
dying frog. For minutes on end.
The most unappealing songs.
Rudolph's self-indulgence. A
trait of Bogdanovich's. And you
know where Bogdanovich is to
day. Nowhere.
Stud
Unoriginal. Keith Carradine,
once again the singer who beds
every female in the cast. Even

more than in Nashville. But in
the same detached, mechanical
way. Carradine — the best bed
room acrobat in Hollywood. His
character, once again the non
conformist singer, still pursuing
the only woman who doesn't
want him — the fragile house
wife. This time Geraldine Chap
lin instead of Lily Tomlin. The
fragile housewife with the unaf
fectionate (at least with her)
husband. Harvey keitel, instead
of Ned Beatty. A brilliant actor,
Keitel. No more need be said
about him.
The people of L.A. portrayed
typically. Rootless. Hungry.
Sally kellerman the sexually
voracious realtor instead of Shel
ley Duvall as the voracious
groupie. The fear. The indi
vidualism. Except they're the
same in Nashville. Maybe
they're smoother, more
polished, more sophisticated in

L.A. But they're still as plastic, as
affected, as blundering. Anyone
who's ever visited Los Angeles
knows the feeling of being en
cased in vacuform.
Fragmented. As if he was un
sure how to continue with a
scene, Rudolph merely cuts
away to someone else. An in
teresting way of showing in
complete lives, with incomplete
shots. The story is fragmented
because its characters are frag
mented. The movie is hollow be
cause its characters are hollow.
Welcome to L.A. pales beside
its parent. It has half as many
characters. Is half as well writ
ten. Half as finely woven to
gether. Must we be subjected to
Rudolph's excessive lessons on
how to make a movie? Lost root
less people in a lost rootless
town in a lost rootless movie. Art
once again imitates life. Life 1,
Art 0.

the throne. Rudolph, screenwri
ter of Breakfast of Champions,
Buffalo Bill and his first directo
rial effort. Welcome To L.A.
Heralded as the brightest direc

torial star since Martin Scorsese.
In actuality, the brightest direc
torial star since Peter Bog
danovich.
Welcomc To L.A. Reminiscent
of Nashville. Based on
Nashville. Exactly like
Nashville. Only not as smooth.
To believe Rudolph's vision of
Los Angeles, it is just like
Nashville. With the same plastic
people. The same rootless mig
rants. Adrift. Will the next film
be Topeka, a dissection of the
dissatisfaction of the agribusi
ness community in the Mid

west?
Welcome To L.A., a compen
dium of bad habits only made
acceptable by Altman because
he is a master. Rudolph is an in
fant playing with blocks. His
film, self-indulgent, unoriginal,
fragmented. Above all frag
mented. Except for the scenes of
Richard Baskin, the composer.
In Nashville, Haven Hamilton
(Henry Gibson) threw Baskin out
of a recording session for si ngi ng
like a frog. Here the accusation
comes out in full force. Baskin
does indeed sing like a frog. A
dying frog. For minutes on end.
The most unappealing songs.
Rudolph's self-indulgence. A
trait of Bogdanovich's. And you
know where Bogdanovich is to
day. Nowhere.
Stud
Unoriginal. Keith Carradine,
once again the singer who beds
every female in the cast. Even

more than in Nashville. But in
the same detached, mechanical
way. Carradine — the best bed
room acrobat in Hollywood. His
character, once again the non
conformist singer, still pursuing
the only woman who doesn't
want him — the fragile house
wife. This time Geraldine Chap
lin instead of Lily Tomlin. The
fragile housewife with the unaf
fectionate (at least with her)
husband. Harvey keitel, instead
of Ned Beatty. A brilliant actor,
Keitel. No more need be said
about him.
The people of L.A. portrayed
typically. Rootless. Hungry.
Sally kellerman the sexually
voracious realtor instead of Shel
ley Duvall as the voracious
groupie. The fear. The indi
vidualism. Except they're the
same in Nashville. Maybe
they're smoother, more
polished, more sophisticated in

L.A. But they're still as plastic, as
affected, as blundering. Anyone
who's ever visited Los Angeles
knows the feeling of being en
cased in vacuform.
Fragmented. As if he was un
sure how to continue with a
scene, Rudolph merely cuts
away to someone else. An in
teresting way of showing in
complete lives, with incomplete
shots. The story is fragmented
because its characters are frag
mented. The movie is hollow be
cause its characters are hollow.
Welcome to L.A. pales beside
its parent. It has half as many
characters. Is half as well writ
ten. Half as finely woven to
gether. Must we be subjected to
Rudolph's excessive lessons on
how to make a movie? Lost root
less people in a lost rootless
town in a lost rootless movie. Art
once again imitates life. Life 1,
Art 0.
