Court rebuffs Watergate appeal
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
rebuffed an attempt by three Watergate defen
dants to argue that their convictions should be
reversed because of a rare news report about sec
ret court proceedings.
The justices turned down without comment a
request by lawyers for former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and one-time White House aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman to file a supple
mental memorandum outlining the impact of the
news report.
If attorneys for the three men had been permit
ted to file the memorandum, they would have
argued that the news "leak" from the court made
necessary the overturning of all three convic
tions.
The news report aired by National Public
Radio two weeks ago said the court had voted to
deny the cover-up conviction appeals but that
Chief Justice Warren Burger was delaying any
announcement of the vote.
The report said the court had split 5-3 to deny
the appeals. It added that Burger was delaying
announcement of t he vote in hopes of persuading
at least one other justice to join those voting to
review the case. In such appeals, four votes are
needed to grant review.
Delays in announcing votes are not infrequent
at the court. Hut leaks about the private, inner
workings of the nation's highest court are very
rare. Yesterday's action could be interpreted as a
move by the justices to eliminate any additional
outside pressure in its deliberations.
State judge, 82, ordered to retire
San Francisco — In an unprecedented action, a
special judicial panel yesterday ordered the re
tirement with pension of an 82-year-old state
Supreme Court justice it says can no longer per
form his duties because of senility.
but the tribunal stopped short of the possible
disciplinary course of removing Assoc. Justice
Marshall McComb from office without pension
in spite of what the panel called "specific in
stances of bizarre behavior."

The action against McComb marked the first
time in California history that a Supreme Court
justice had been forced out of office.
The panel said it concurred wit h a Commission
on Judicial Performance finding that McComb is
suffering from senile dementia "that seriously
interferes with the performance of his judicial
duties and that the disability is, or is likely to
become, permanent."
The commission had charged McComb with
falling asleep on the bench, doing exercises in
court and failing to attend court sessions and
deliberations. McComb had denied all the allega
tions and charged that the proceeding was un
constitutional.
A veteran of 20 years on the high court,
McComb, who will be 83 on Friday, was sus
pended in January after the commission recom
mended that he be removed or retired from the
bench.
McComb's 67-year-old wife, Margaret, who
was appointed his permanent conservator Feb.
28, had asked that he be retired gracefully from
the court. He is entitled toa pension of more than
$31,000 a year.
Pipeline through Canada proposed
Washington — Members of the Federal Power
Commission (FPC) yesterday recommended to
President Jimmy Carter an overland pipeline sys
tem through Canada for transporting Alaskan
natural gas to U.S. markets.
However, the four FPC commissioners divided
over which pending trans-Canada proposal to
recommend to the president.
Two FPC members favored the plan of Alaska
Arctic Cas and two others favored the package
presented by Northwest Pipeline Corp. through
its Alcan Pipeline Co. subsidiary.
But all four commissioners said if the Arctic
proves impossible they favored the Northwest
proposal. And they added in a letter transmitted
to the president, if neither trans-Canada plan is
found feasible the third proposal of El Paso
Natural Gas Co. was an "economically viable"
alternative.
In terms of today's prices, the companies esti

mate these costs for completion of their pipelines
intheearly 1980s: Arc tic,sB.l billion; Northwest
$6.7 billion; El Paso $6.5 billion.
Before a final decision is reached, the president
must evaluate the FPC proposal and make a re
commendation to Congress by Dec. 1. Congress
has 60 days to decide whether to accept the pres
ident's proposal.
The law establishing the timetable also limits
court challenges, a move designed to avoid the
litigation that delayed construction of the Alaska
oil pipeline.
The Canadian routes require approval of the
Canadian government.
Protestant militants organize strike
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Protestant milit
ants organizing a nationwide general strike to
begin at midnight yesterday claim Britain is pre
pared "for a bloodbath" against the strikers.
"We have been counting the number of sol
diers coming into the province over the last few
days and our head-count is something like
8000," said Jim Smyth, a spokesman for the Un
ited Unionist Action Council, the organization
that called the strike.
The British government has reported sending
1200 soldiers to Ulster over the past three days,
bringing the total army strength to 15,500.
This is the largest number of British troops in
the province for the last three years. They are
trying to smother sectarian warfare between
militants among the country's one million Pro
testants and half a million Roman Catholics.
The Action Council, led by hard-line Protes
tant politicians, is demanding Britain move im
mediately to eliminate guerrillas of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army (IRA).
The predominantly Catholic IRA is seeking to
force Britain to relinquish the provinceand unite
it with the Irish republic and its Catholic major
ity.
Gambling OK at Tahoe stateside
Sacramento — Gambling would be legalized at
any Lake Tahoe casinos that the U.S. Supreme
Court found to be in California under proposed

legislation announced yesterday.
Assemblyman Mike Cullen (D-Long Beach)
sairl his bill would allow gambling in the affected
casinos to continue if the high court moved the
boundary between California and Nevada east
ward.
As many as three casinos now in Nevada could
be in (California if the court shifted the border that
runs from the lake to Oregon, in accordance with
new findings of a century-old surveying error
A suit filed by California, however, asks the
court to recognize the currently accepted bound
ary.
Tribesmen surround laborers
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — Armed mountain
tribesmen supporting the current antigovern
ment movement have encircled some 1200
Chinese laborers working on the karakoram
highway near t lie Chinese border, an informed
source reported yesterday.
The tribesmen, fierce kohistanis who battled
the Pakistan army for two months last fall, have
cut off roughly 50 miles of the projected highway
along the old "silk road," burning army bulldoz
ers and dynamiting small bridges, the source
said. The workers were bottled up in camps as
near as 70 miles to Pakistan's border with China.
At least four of the Chinese members of
People's Liberation Army labor battalions have
been released at the border with a list of the
kohistanis' demands, the source said.
The kohistanis want Pakistan to release those
tribesmen detained last October and November,
and the acceptance of the opposition Pakistan
National Alliance's demands that new elections
be called and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
resign, the source said.
Provisions would be exhausted by today and
the army command feared the affair could de
velop into a major crisis, the source disclosed.
