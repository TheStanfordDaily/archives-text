# Proposed state law to forbid wearing Nazi outfit in public
## 
### Katherine Ellison 
The State and National Affairs Committee of the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors acted in special session
yesterday to revise the wording of a legislative proposal
designed to make illegal the public wearing of the Nazi
uniform in California.
Supervisors Robert Mendelsohn and Diane Feinsteinand
Hoard President Quentin Kopp, who constitute the commit
tee and are the authors of the proposal, heard testimony
concerning the expression of the bill's purpose for half an
hour. They then voted to narrow the declaration of intent.
The original declaration of intent proposed to "prohibit
the wearing of uniforms similar to those parties of any
foreign state or any political party, past or present, which
operates or operated in any foreign state, nation or govern
ment."
New lines
The new opening lines will specify that it is the "wearing
of certain uniforms in public, "as described in the New York
State Military Code (Section 238.C) and enacted as law
there in 19f>8 â€” but specifically Nazi stormtrooper regalia
that would be prohibited. The state of Florida has similar
legislation. Neither law has been protested to date.
haw Prof. Paul Brest, when asked for a comment, said,
"The Supreme Court of the United States hasn't ruled on
any case like this before, but if it were to, I'm pretty certain
that the right of a Nazi to wear his uniform would be up
held."
Brest said this proposal "is a clear violation of the First
Amendment."
Feinstein first instigated the proposal three weeks ago, a
few days after the Rudolf Hess bookstore was opened across
the street from Temple B'nai Fmmanuel in San Francisco's
Sunset District.
The violence and vandalism that followed for two davs,

culminating in a fire-bombed bookstore and the shattering
of some of the synagogue's memorial stained-glass win
dows, is sufficient justification for legislation, Feinstein
alleged in a statement prepared for the press.
Feinstein pointed to recent harrassment of Jewish and
black citizens by the San Francisco Nazi party and claimed
that incidents such as the recent death threats to a San
Francisco renter whose tenants had opened a kosher meat
market are causing "a substantial portion of our citizenry"
to be "intimidated."
Agreement
Most of the more than ;i() member audience seemed to
agree the original wording of the statement was too broad to
have much chance for success in Sacramento. However,
Theodore Alexander, rabbi of B'nai Fmmanuel, said he
considered the final version not broad enough.
The wearing of ku k lux Man (kkk) regalia, he said, must
be prohibited equally in legislation against "hate groups."
as "the point is the peddling of hatred."
Short comments were delivered by representatives of the
American Civil Liberties union and the Jewish Community
Relations Board. No uniformed Nazis or kkk members
attended the meeting. The session proceeded quite rapidly,
with an aura of general agreement. No one protested the
proposal's intent.
The finalized wording of Feinstein's statement will be
voted on by the full board Monday at 2 p.m. in City Hall.
The proposal's authors said they expect it to pass and
then to appear for voting in Sacramento this session.
If the proposal fails to become adopted as state law, there
is a possibility of attempting to pass it as a San Francisco
city ordinance. Feinstein's secretary, however, when asked
whether the supervisors might work for this end. re
sponded. "Probablv not."
