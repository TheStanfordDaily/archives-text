# Senate changes its by-laws
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Seven of the 10 by-law amendments
submitted by a SWOPSI class were
passed by the ASSU Senate at its meet
ing last night.
Changes made by these by-law
amendments include forming an
Academic Affairs Committee to review
all matters concerning academic and
student affairs and requiring all bills or
resolutions to be assigned to either the
Academic Affairs, Finance or Rules
Committee before the matters go to the
senate.
Two of the amendments dealt with
the duties and structure of the Finance
and Rules Committees. In addition, the
phrase "Council of Presidents" is to
replace the words "President" or
"Vice President" wherever they ap
pear in the by-laws.
Another SWOPSI class amendment
passed dealt with the Council of Presi
dents (COP), and stated that any bill or
resolution passed by the senate could
be vetoed by the signatures of three
COP members.

Dan Livingston, senate Finance
Committee chairman, presented six
requests for money in his report and
announced there is approximately
$1950 remaining in the senate's dis
cretionary fund.
Livingston said he was surprised so
much money was left. "It's really too
bad because we have been being really
tight to groups that needed money," he
commented.
Four of the financial requests by or
ganizations were tabled until the next
senate meeting because no representa
tive from the group in question was
present to answer questions.
The senate did vote to allocate up to
$80 to a series of workshops centered
on the theme of appropriate careers.
The workshops are part of a project for
two SWOFSI classes last quarter.
The senate also passed two by-law
amendments submitted by Sen. Doug
13andow. The first of these amend
ments allows for the appearance on fu
ture election ballots of arguments for
and against each proposed constitu
tional amendment and referendum
question, in addition to any explana
tion needed to make them understand
able to voters.
Fee refunds
The other amendment changed the
by-laws to instruct the financial man
ager to give out fee assessment refunds
in order to rectify a problem encoun
tered last month with the by-laws re
quiring the organizations to give out
their own refunds.
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Mathe reported that when the new
procedure of giving out vouchers in
White Plaza for students to claim their
fee assessment refunds in the ASSU
office was initiated, "only one student
utilized this system."
A request for $250 for graduate stu
dent T.G.I.F. parties submitted by Sen.
Rick Hoft was also passed by the senate
by a roll call vote of 10-3.
Task force
The senate also voted to instruct the
Nominations Committee fo select two

students to serve on the task force on
the Overseas Studies Program prop
osed by Sen. Tim Ferguson.
At the end of the meeting, Sen. Steve
Wurzburg attempted to have the se
nate vote on his proposed by-law
amendment for restructuring the
Nominations Committee. However,
co-president Creg Larson objected,
saying the ASSI I Constitution requires
that a by-laws amendment be an
nounced prior to the meeting at which
it is to be discussed.
Rather than fight this objection.
Sharp recommended adjourning the
meeting and calling a special meeting
immediately afterward. After the se
nate voted to adjourn, though, there
vvus no longer a quorum to hold a spe
cial meeting.
