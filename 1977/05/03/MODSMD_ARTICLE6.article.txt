# Carter: replace welfare system
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter proposed scrapping the
present welfare system yesterday and
replacing it with a multi-tiered prog
ram to provide jobs for those who can
work, cash for those who can't and in
come tax credits for the working poor.
Health Education and Welfare
(HEW) Secretary Joseph Califano Jr.,
who called welfare reform the Middle
East of domestic politics, told repor
ters the eventual cost of the plan and
many details still have not been
worked out.
The president promised he would
complete the legislative proposals to
implement the new system by the first
week in August aftei consultations
with legislative leaders in each of the
50 states.
The president had promised in his
town meeting address in Clinton.
Mass.. on March 1(5 that "on May 1, Joe
Califano will come forward and prop
ose to the Congress a comprehensive
revision of the entire welfare system."
Worse than expected
But he said yesterday the existing
system "is worse than we thought"
and deferred sending legislation to
Congress.
He said the initial cost of the revised
system he will propose won't cost any
more than the present system, which is
now budgeted at $23.6 billion for fiscal
1978.
Carter said a three-month study of
the welfare system by HEW and other
agencies had convinced him "that the
present welfare programs should be
scrapped entirely and a totally new
system implemented."
"If the new legislation can be
adopted early in 1978. an additional
three years will be required to imple
ment the program," Carter said.
Welfare cost
The president said the cost of wel
fare to state and local governments
"should be reduced as rapidly as fed

eral resources permit," but stopped
short of promising a federal takeover of
the system as many states have urged.
Carter. Califano and Labor Secretary
F. Ray Marshall presented only a broad
outline of the proposed legislation and
gave few details.
The Carter plan includes:
—Up to two million public service
jobs designed to give access to a job to
every family with children and a fam
ily member able to work.
—Earned income tax credit for the
working poor, possibly higher than
present levels or supplemented with
cash.
—"A decent income" for those who
can't work, with the benefits now pro
vided by Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Supplemental Security
Income and food stamps consolidated
in one cash payment. The payment
would be the same for all recipients
nationwide except where adjusted for
cost-of-living differences.
Incentives
Carter said the system would in
clude incentives to encourage people
to take jobs in the private sector rather
than public service jobs. He said it also
would encourage people to work by
ensuring that a family with at least one
person working would make more
than a family on welfare.
He also pledged that incentives
would be designed to keep families to
gether. In many states, the present sys
tem makes it financially rewarding for
a working father to leave home and let
his family go on welfare.
"The programs should be simpler
and easier to administer." Carter said,
and "there should be incentives to be
honest and to eliminate fraud."
He said the government would pro
vide training and employment prog
rams for those who can't find work in
private industry.

—Earned income tax credit for the
working poor, possibly higher than
present levels or supplemented with
cash.
—"A decent income" for those who
can't work, with the benefits now pro
vided by Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Supplemental Security
Income and food stamps consolidated
in one cash payment. The payment
would be the same for all recipients
nationwide except where adjusted for
cost-of-living differences.
Incentives
Carter said the system would in
clude incentives to encourage people
to take jobs in the private sector rather
than public service jobs. He said it also
would encourage people to work by
ensuring that a family with at least one
person working would make more
than a family on welfare.
He also pledged that incentives
would be designed to keep families to
gether. In many states, the present sys
tem makes it financially rewarding for
a working father to leave home and let
his family go on welfare.
"The programs should be simpler
and easier to administer." Carter said,
and "there should be incentives to be
honest and to eliminate fraud."
He said the government would pro
vide training and employment prog
rams for those who can't find work in
private industry.
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter proposed scrapping the
present welfare system yesterday and
replacing it with a multi-tiered prog
ram to provide jobs for those who can
work, cash for those who can't and in
come tax credits for the working poor.
Health Education and Welfare
(HEW) Secretary Joseph Califano Jr.,
who called welfare reform the Middle
East of domestic politics, told repor
ters the eventual cost of the plan and
many details still have not been
worked out.
The president promised he would
complete the legislative proposals to
implement the new system by the first
week in August aftei consultations
with legislative leaders in each of the
50 states.
The president had promised in his
town meeting address in Clinton.
Mass.. on March 1(5 that "on May 1, Joe
Califano will come forward and prop
ose to the Congress a comprehensive
revision of the entire welfare system."
Worse than expected
But he said yesterday the existing
system "is worse than we thought"
and deferred sending legislation to
Congress.
He said the initial cost of the revised
system he will propose won't cost any
more than the present system, which is
now budgeted at $23.6 billion for fiscal
1978.
Carter said a three-month study of
the welfare system by HEW and other
agencies had convinced him "that the
present welfare programs should be
scrapped entirely and a totally new
system implemented."
"If the new legislation can be
adopted early in 1978. an additional
three years will be required to imple
ment the program," Carter said.
Welfare cost
The president said the cost of wel
fare to state and local governments
"should be reduced as rapidly as fed

eral resources permit," but stopped
short of promising a federal takeover of
the system as many states have urged.
Carter. Califano and Labor Secretary
F. Ray Marshall presented only a broad
outline of the proposed legislation and
gave few details.
The Carter plan includes:
—Up to two million public service
jobs designed to give access to a job to
every family with children and a fam
ily member able to work.
—Earned income tax credit for the
working poor, possibly higher than
present levels or supplemented with
cash.
—"A decent income" for those who
can't work, with the benefits now pro
vided by Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Supplemental Security
