# Sprucing up campus for graduation
## University repairs Frost 
### Jill Liscom 
The University has spent more than $4000 in the last
four weeks repairing Frost Amphitheater in preparation
for the June 12 graduation ceremonies, said Herbert
Kong, grounds supervisor for Plant Services.
The $4000 was used mainly to cover material and
installation costs for replacing broken header boards
along the terraced sides of the amphitheater bowl, Kong
said. About $500 more will be spent on minimal replant
ing of trees and shrubs that died from the drought, he
said.
At least 12 large Monterey pines near one of the cam
pus entrances have died, said Kong, and several other
trees have dead branches.
According to Kong, trees in key locations will be re
placed and additional shrubs and trees may be temporar
ily planted in containers sunk into the ground.
Still beautiful
Except for the areas around the entrance. Kong said he
thought the effects of the drought are "not that notice
able, especially if people have not seen the amphitheater
before. It's still going to be a beautiful setting."
"We're waiting until all concerts are finished before
we do any replanting," Kong explained. "We've already
reseeded the lawn area where it had been killed by the
drought, but hopefully the lawn won't get too trampled
at the concerts."
Krost Amphitheater is especially vulnerable to the
drought. Kong noted, because it is artificially con

structed. "Most of tho trees are planted on a sloped
surface, so their roots have a hard time soaking in
deeply." he said. "The gradient is so steep the water runs
away."
Besides the amphitheater, the areas on campus which
have been affected most severely by the drought are the
Arboretum and the trees just north of the golf course
driving range, said Fong. He added that newly-planted
trees and shrubs are also greatly affected by the drought.
Center of campus
Although most of the plants will "have to fend for
themselves." Fong commented, "in the heart of the cam
pus. we're not going to allow any trees to die. if we can
help it."
Tap water is currently being used to water the am
phitheater. but Plant Services is looking into the possi
bility of using recycled water from the steam plant cool
ing towers and the Palo Alto municipal sewer plant,
Fong reported.
Fong also said a 1000-gallon capacity tanker truck will
be used to water some of the trees and shrubs, starting
July 1. The truck is equipped with a small pump and a
long steel injection tube which forces water to the roots
of the plant, he said.
"It will take at least two years of above-average rainfall
to replenish normal ground water levels," Fong esti
mated. "Hopefully, in the future people will be a lot
more conscious of not wasting water."

Although most of the plants will "have to fend for
themselves." Fong commented, "in the heart of the cam

help it."
Tap water is currently being used to water the am
phitheater. but Plant Services is looking into the possi
bility of using recycled water from the steam plant cool

Fong reported.
Fong also said a 1000-gallon capacity tanker truck will
be used to water some of the trees and shrubs, starting
July 1. The truck is equipped with a small pump and a
long steel injection tube which forces water to the roots
of the plant, he said.
"It will take at least two years of above-average rainfall
to replenish normal ground water levels," Fong esti
mated. "Hopefully, in the future people will be a lot
more conscious of not wasting water."

University plans to replace trees in key locations and
temporarily plant other potted shrubs and trees to
improve the campus' appearance for graduation
ceremonies.
The University has spent more than $4000 in the last
four weeks repairing Frost Amphitheater in preparation
for the June 12 graduation ceremonies, said Herbert
Kong, grounds supervisor for Plant Services.
The $4000 was used mainly to cover material and
installation costs for replacing broken header boards
along the terraced sides of the amphitheater bowl, Kong
said. About $500 more will be spent on minimal replant
ing of trees and shrubs that died from the drought, he
said.
At least 12 large Monterey pines near one of the cam
pus entrances have died, said Kong, and several other
trees have dead branches.
According to Kong, trees in key locations will be re
placed and additional shrubs and trees may be temporar
ily planted in containers sunk into the ground.
Still beautiful
Except for the areas around the entrance. Kong said he
thought the effects of the drought are "not that notice
able, especially if people have not seen the amphitheater
before. It's still going to be a beautiful setting."
"We're waiting until all concerts are finished before
we do any replanting," Kong explained. "We've already
reseeded the lawn area where it had been killed by the
drought, but hopefully the lawn won't get too trampled
at the concerts."
Krost Amphitheater is especially vulnerable to the
drought. Kong noted, because it is artificially con

structed. "Most of tho trees are planted on a sloped
surface, so their roots have a hard time soaking in
deeply." he said. "The gradient is so steep the water runs
away."
Besides the amphitheater, the areas on campus which
have been affected most severely by the drought are the
Arboretum and the trees just north of the golf course
driving range, said Fong. He added that newly-planted
trees and shrubs are also greatly affected by the drought.
