Half Sky Pro Bern
As a broadly based, multi
ethnic organization composed of
women in the Stanford com
munity, we are deeply con
cerned about the denial of tenure
to Sandra Bern.
Those of us who have had Bern
as a professor have been impre
ssed by her teaching ability and
by her scholarly understanding
of the origins and impact of
societal sex roles.
Those of us who have partici
pated in the many SWOPS I
courses she has sponsored on
women's issues have found
them highly educational and en
riching. We feel her departure
would leave a substantial gap in
the Stanford curriculum.
Stanford is distinguished by
its commitment to broad liberal
education and its insistence on
the scholarly exchange of wide
ranging social, political and
philosophic views. We find
Bern's ground-breaking study of
human personality and her
feminist perspective absolutely
indispensible to this exchange,
especially since there is no de
signated women's studies major
at Stanford.
Bern's teaching and research
make the never ending process
of our intellectual development
more challenging and complete.
There are many women at
Stanford for whom Sandra Bern
is a rare role model. She has been
successful, earning the acclaim
of her colleagues in the Stanford
psychology department and in
the American Psychology As
sociation, without forsaking her
role as a familv member.

While few of us may seek to
copy Bern's innovative lifestyle
exactly, it gives us confidence in
our own abilities to develop per
sonal solutions to the conflict be
tween a careerand relationships.
Of 1133 professors here, only
34 are women. Having efficaci
ous female professors helps us to
overcome the years of upbring
ing amid subtle societal pres
sures enforcing the idea that
women can never be as compe
tent as men.
Presently only 29 female pro
fessors at Stanford have tenure.
We feel an urgent need for the
University to support women.
One of the most effective ways of
showing this support is to hire
and tenure qualified women pro
fessors.
Considering her scholarly
achievements and high teaching
quality, it is difficult to under
stand how Stanford can fail to
tenure Sandra Bern and make her
a permanent part of the U ni versi
ty's academic life.

Senseless killing
This afternoon John Perkins
will give the Fifth Annual Kent
State-Jackson State Memorial
Lecture.
One of the most remarkable
leaders in the black community,
itis fitting that Perkins should be
givingthis lecture, since hegrew"
up in the vicinity of Jackson,
Mississippi, and was present the
night of the Jackson State mur

ders.
What happened in May 1970?
On campuses across the nation,
students frustrated by President
Richard Nixon's decision to
send American soldiers to Cam
bodia, had moved to organize
rallies and protests.
At Kent State, the rally was
scheduled for noon on the col
lege green. The Ohio National
Guard, fatigued from controlling
a wildcat labor strike, was sum
moned to the Ohio campus to
control the rally.
Innocent victims
The four students killed by the
burst of guardsmen's gunfire
were neither organizers nor ac
tive participants in the rally.
Each had stepped out onto the
green merely to observe, just as
one of us might anonymously
join the fringe of a crowd in
White Plaza. Although some
rocks were hurled at the
guardsmen, they made no at
tempt to discriminate among
members of the crowd when
they opened fire.
The events at Jackson State 10
days later, in which two black
students were shot and killed at
a women's dormitory, only add
to the nightmarish memory of
that spring. A federal investiga
tion later showed that the front
of the dormitory had been struck
by hundreds of bullets.
The presidential commission
which investigated the killings
found that they were "unneces
sary, unwarranted and inexcus
able." But the Mississippi state
grand jury acquited the highway
patrolmen who were, in its
words, "justified in shooting

into the dormitory."
We need to remember that
these two incidents were only
the most publicized in a whole
series which included the mur
der of three civil rights workers
in Mississippi in the '60s, the
students slain at Southern Uni
versity in 1972, and the violence
at People's Park in Berkeley.
These events were the inevita
ble conclusion of a malaise in
our society: a willingness to
characterize groups of people as
abstract entities. "They" are pro
testers, radicals, communists,
"gooks" or whatever. As such,
"they" are not human.
Still the same?
Is there any evidence that
things have changed in seven
years? Have we ceased to read
about political corruption and
the abuse of power? Have we
closed our eyes to the destruc
tion of human beings that is re
ported from San Francisco to
Dublin to Uganda?
This afternoon we wil 1 have an

opportunity to listen to a man
whose brother was murdered by
the police for no reason, a man
who had to struggle to register as
a voter, and who was denied
even a basic secondary educa
tion in Mississippi.
But John Perkins is not bitter
or angry. For years he has turned
his energy toward improving the
situation of black people in Mis
sissippi, by voter registration
drives, by providing and inspir
ing alternative quality educa
tion, by founding cooperatives
for housing and food. Perkins
has found a way to organize his
community to help themselves,
to commit their own resources to
a better life.
And his interest today is look
ing forward to ways that blacks
and whites can really begin to
work together, "moving beyond
guilt and blame."
