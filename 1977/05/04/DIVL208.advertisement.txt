SEVEN THINGS
NOT TO DO
THIS SUMMER.
Summer can be fun if you know a few common things to avoid
doing.
1. Do not swim at any beach where they have loudspeakers
playing the soundtrack from "claws'"
2. Do not. under any circumstances, try to pick up a cow.
3. Do not answer any want ad foi a summer job that sounds
too good to be true unless you enjoy selling steak knives.
4. Do not tell your parents that, after graduation, you have
decided on an exciting career in motel management.
5. Do not accept a date from anyone wearing a green leisure
suit and roller skates.
6. Do not. under any circumstances, attempt to feed your pet
gerbil a boa constrictor.
7. Do not forget the one word for beer. As your Dean of Beer.
I can think of nothing more important for you to remember.
So have fun. have Schlitz. and 111 see you next fall.
