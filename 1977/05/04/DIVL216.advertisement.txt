It's here! The latest hilarious collection of slings
and arrows from Garry Trudeau—
The Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist whose net
tling political observations have made him a house
hold name across the country. And, often, a sensitive
topic in Washington.
Now Trudeau mo- s still farther afield—following
Uncle Duke to China. Where, as America's new en
voy, he meets a catatonically smiling Chairman Mao
and the kind of adventures you'd expect with "an es
pecially tricky people."
AN ESPECIALLY TRICKY PEOPLE
