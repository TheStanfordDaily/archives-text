# Urges moral suasion
## Reagan analyzes policy in S. Africa 
### Jordan Lorence 
"Moral suasion" not economic pres
sure is the best way for the United
States to influence policy in South Af
rica, former Gov. Ronald Reagan said
last night at Bishop Auditorium.
The speech was sponsored by the
Hoover Institution. Reagan was made
an honorary fellow at Hoover when he
donated hit.' gubernatorial papers here
shortly after leaving office in 1975.
Reagan gave a few remarks and then
answered questions from the audience
of 400.
Reagan said he supported the Bakke
decision. "I am disturbed by reverse
discrimination, though I see a need to
offset the discrimination of the past,"
he said.
He said quota systems were used in
the past to exclude Catholics and Jews
from schools and jobs so he did not
approve of such systems today.
Energy problem
Reagan also criticized President
Jimmy Carter's energy proposals as a
"program of despair." Reagan said
government regulation has caused
much of the energy problem and dere
gulation of oil and gas prices would
give needed incentives for drillers to
find alternate sources of energy.
Reagan called Carter's stand on
human rights "hypocritical."
"How can we refuse to buy chrome
from Rhodesia on the basis of human

rights when we are working to open
trade with Vietnam and Cuba?"
Reagan asked.
Human rights
A member of the audience asked
Reagan how the United States could
then support countries like South
Korea and Iran that violate human
rights. Reagan replied that he didn't
know about Iran, but said Korea is on a
"war footing," because it is so close to
a country that almost conquered it.
'Improprieties'
Reagan said former President
Richard Nixon was clearly guilty of
"political improprieties." Headded he
didn't know whether Nixon was guilty
of any criminal acts.
When asked who the Republicans
had for presidential candidates in
1980. Reagan said, "A battalion. With
out an incumbent, the line will form to
the right."
Reagan said he opposes the legaliza
tion of marijuana, partly because of the
increase in drug-related traffic acci
dents. He questioned legalization of
victimless crimes by asking, "are they
really victimless?"
Reagan said he supports building
the B-l bomber because, he said, we
are behind the Russians in the Arms
race. Reagan said Leonid Brezhnev, in
a secret speech to Eastern European
leaders, declared by 1985 the Soviet
Union will be able to impose its will on

any country in the world.
Reagan said the United States' one
great advantage over the Russians is its
industrial capability.
"We should say to the Russians,
either you join a legitimate disarma
ment or you start an arms race you
can't win," Reagan said.
Reagan also said he didn't support
the Equal Rights Amendment. benaiitt«
"it would open the door for a lot of
mischief." He said he supports equal
rights for women, but advocates
specific statutes to erase specific prob
lems.

Reagan said he opposes splitting of
California into two states, because
"California is a state of mind."
When asked about the Panama
Canal, Reagan said, "There is no such
thing as a Panama Canal. There is an
American canal in Panama."
There was no picketing or heckling
during the speech, although members
of the Alliance for Radical Change had
said earlier that such measures were
planned.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of
Hoover, said future campus addresses
by Reagan are planned.
