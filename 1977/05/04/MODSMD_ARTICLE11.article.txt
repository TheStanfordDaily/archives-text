Is there anything that can be done about the
humming of the flourescent lights in the buck read
ing room of Main Library (the map room - located
directly beneath the Bender Room)?
Being that it is one of the warmest places to
study on campus I spend much of my on-campus
tunc there, but recently the humming lights are
driving me out of my mind.
Is there anything Plant Senices can do about
this situation'. 1 ' -P.J.B.C.
In an earlier Bug Me (April 20), I said that the
place to call for such situations is: "the Work. Con
trol Center at Facilities and Planning." That is not
correct. It should have read: "the Work Control
(ienter at Plant Services." It was a mistake on my
part.
The number to cal 1 however, is still 497-2281. So
describe the problem lights to them, and they will
do something about it.
Every morning I see workmen wcdking back and
lorth in various parts of the campus aimlessly
pushing some kind of gusoline powered machine.
These men claim they are cleaning the
sidewalks but actually they are raising huge
clouds of dust, creating a lot of noise, using preci
ous fuel - and <dl they really do is blow trash and
debris into the bushes, from where it will sooner or
later blow out again.
Shouldn't the University be concerned about the
waste of fuel and the noise pollution involved in
these operations? —A.M.
According to Jason Mavis, Director of Plant Ser
vices, they're not supposed to he blowing trashand
debris, but leaves. "Leaves are blown into the
shrubbery where they decay and provide mulch,"
he said.

Since the alternative to these little gasoline
machines is hand sweeping. Mavis said that the
"energy use is minimal compared to the man
power cost."
So, even though they are noisy, he believes that
they are, "the most efficient and effective way to
handle the problem."

What are a student's rights concerning access to
medical files at Cowell? I requested to see my file,
but the secretaries said that I would have to see a
doctor to get the information I needed. Do I have
some right to inspect my own file? -M.L.
Students do have the right to know what is in
their files, but they need to go through the doctors
if they do, according to James McClenahan, Direc
tor-of Cowell Health Center.
He said that the "files are the property of the
health service and are used for communication
between professionals." So as the case in most
hospitals, files are not simply handed over the
desk by secretaries.
McClenahan stressed that they are "not trying to
be secretive," but that some of the file contents are
better presented verbally or at the doctor's discre
tion. Sometimes opinions or preliminary diag
noses are entered in the file which could be mis
leading to the student if not properly explained.
Therefore "students are sent to see a doctor so
that some filtration and explanation can occur." In
this way, as many misunderstandings as possible
can be avoided.

Therefore "students are sent to see a doctor so

Is there anything that can be done about the
humming of the flourescent lights in the buck read
ing room of Main Library (the map room - located
directly beneath the Bender Room)?
Being that it is one of the warmest places to
study on campus I spend much of my on-campus
tunc there, but recently the humming lights are
driving me out of my mind.
Is there anything Plant Senices can do about
this situation'. 1 ' -P.J.B.C.
In an earlier Bug Me (April 20), I said that the
place to call for such situations is: "the Work. Con
trol Center at Facilities and Planning." That is not
correct. It should have read: "the Work Control
(ienter at Plant Services." It was a mistake on my
part.
The number to cal 1 however, is still 497-2281. So
describe the problem lights to them, and they will
do something about it.
Every morning I see workmen wcdking back and
lorth in various parts of the campus aimlessly
pushing some kind of gusoline powered machine.
These men claim they are cleaning the
sidewalks but actually they are raising huge
clouds of dust, creating a lot of noise, using preci
ous fuel - and <dl they really do is blow trash and
debris into the bushes, from where it will sooner or
later blow out again.
Shouldn't the University be concerned about the
waste of fuel and the noise pollution involved in
these operations? —A.M.
According to Jason Mavis, Director of Plant Ser
vices, they're not supposed to he blowing trashand
debris, but leaves. "Leaves are blown into the
shrubbery where they decay and provide mulch,"
he said.

Since the alternative to these little gasoline
machines is hand sweeping. Mavis said that the
"energy use is minimal compared to the man
power cost."
So, even though they are noisy, he believes that
they are, "the most efficient and effective way to
handle the problem."

What are a student's rights concerning access to
medical files at Cowell? I requested to see my file,
but the secretaries said that I would have to see a
doctor to get the information I needed. Do I have
some right to inspect my own file? -M.L.
Students do have the right to know what is in
their files, but they need to go through the doctors
if they do, according to James McClenahan, Direc
tor-of Cowell Health Center.
He said that the "files are the property of the
health service and are used for communication
between professionals." So as the case in most
hospitals, files are not simply handed over the
desk by secretaries.
McClenahan stressed that they are "not trying to
be secretive," but that some of the file contents are
better presented verbally or at the doctor's discre
tion. Sometimes opinions or preliminary diag
noses are entered in the file which could be mis
leading to the student if not properly explained.
