# Less computer crimes?
## 
### Steve Schiller 
The number of computer
associated crimes will decline in
the future because more sophis
ticated protection techniques
will be developed, but the higher
stakes involved will lead to
larger losses per incident, ac
cording to Donn Parker of the
Stanford Research Institute.
Parker, who is conducting re
search into "computer abuse"
for the National Science Founda
tion, has warned security mea
sures and auditing techniques
.ire lagging far behind
technological advances, while
computer criminals are right on
top of new developments.
Because of the research lag in
setting up new systems, "we

have to anticipate now what the
threats will be three to five years
from now." Parker warned "we
cannot band-aid systems to pro
tect them."
Thrives on challenge
Speaking before an electrical
engineering seminar, he profiled
the computer criminal as a
bright, highly motivated person
who thrives on the challenge
and excitement associated with
such crime.
Such individuals differentiate
morally between hurting an or
ganization and doing harm to
people and usually claim after
capture that many of their col
leagues engage in similar ac
tivities, he said.

One trend Parker said he finds
"very disturbing" is the "almost
total lack of concern for ethics in
technical schools" and compu
ter science departments, where
students regard computer work
simply as a challenging game.
He explained that the industry
most affected by these abuses is
banking because it is a heavy
user of computer technology and
deals with liquid assets.
Second in line is education
where students compromise the
campus facility. These crimes
involve the smallest losses but
the most sophisticated
techniques and the institution
often rewards these students by
giving them jobs in the security
sector after they are caught.
