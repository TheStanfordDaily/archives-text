for first place with 144 totals.
Scott Simpson, the Trojan

ments last year. The PorterCupis
the second top amateur tourney

day 0f67 narrowed Stanford's 13

NCAA bid
USC's No. 2 player, Tony Sills,
the Southern California amateur

champion did not compete in
the tournament due to a back in
jury.
Stanford coach Bud Finger
said the Cards' previous perfor
mance in the Sun Devil along
with their win of the Pac-8
Southern Division title assures
them a bid for the NCAA champ
ionships from the western U.S.
USC qualified for the nationals
by winning eight tournaments
this season.
The Cards' next match is
against San Jose Stale Friday.
The match begins at 12:30 p.m.
on the Stanford Coif Course.
