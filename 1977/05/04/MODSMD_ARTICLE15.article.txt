# Running with the best of them
## Boit leads world in 800 meters 
### Stacy Geiken 
First in a two part series on graduate stu
dent athletes.

Walking around Tresidder Union,
Michael Kipsugut Boit ("just call me
Mike Boit, it is easier") looks like any
other Stanford student.
But, the masters degree candidate in
physical education from Nandi, Kenya,
does more than just study books.
Boit is currently leading the world in
the 800-meter run this year. His season
best of 1:46.1 (run in the Stanford Relays
in March) is more than one second faster
than his nearest competitor. Boit's
lifetime best of 1:43.6 is just one tenth of a
second off of Cuban Alberto Juantorena's
world record.
The soft spoken 27-year-old is really
not sure why he started to run track.
"I started when I was in high school,"
Boit said, "I didn't take a keen interest in
running until I went to the Munich
Olympics (where he placed third in the
800 meters and fourth in the 1500 meters
in 1972).
Running import
"After 1 went to the Olympics I realized
I had some talent and 1 also realized that 1
needed to develop that talent. So that is
one of the reasons why I came to the Un
ited States."
One of the other reasons that Boit came
to the United States was for an education.
"Of course Kenya is still a developing
country, so like most other developing
countries we are still not quite as ad
vanced, educationally," Boit said.
Boit entered Eastern New Mexico Uni
versity (ENMU) as a freshman in the fall of
1971.
After winning many cross country and
track races at ENMU, including being
ranked No. 1 in the world for the 800
meters in 1975 by Track and Field News
magazine, Boit came to Stanford.
Between graduation in New Mexico
and enrollment on the Farm, Boit's track
career went through some hard knocks.
Four years after the Munich Olympics,
Boit had taken advantage of his wiry
6-foot-0, 140-pound frame by preparing
himself for the summer games in
Montreal, Canada. He was one of the favo
rites for the gold medal in the 800 meters.
His previous best of 1:43.8 was only one
tenth of a second off the world record at
that time held by Marcello Fiascaonaro of
Italy.
African boycott
Boit checked into the Olympic village
ready to run. All he had to do was wait for
the final on July 27. But the final never
came for Boit as his country boycotted the
Olympics due to a South African rugby
team playing in New Zealand that sum
mer.
"It was really very difficult (Kenya's
withdrawal) if you try to understand the
whole situation ... It wasn't fair for the
athletes . . .
"You know, I think every athlete who
prepared himself really would never have
agreed to it (the boycott). After preparing
for so long and after taking up so much
time doing all of the training and then you
don't run. You really don't gain anything.
It was a very difficult decision to make,"
Boit did stay, however, to see the heats

and finals. The final featured a world re
cord performance by Juantorena.
"I think it was a good race, yeah," Boit
said with a toothy grin.
Boit said that the world record in the
final was not solely due to Juantorena.
"Actually, one person didn't play the
(leading) role. There was nobody leading
by himself because they were all together,
all the way."
Modestly, Boit said that he does not
think that it would be fair to project how
he would have done in the final in

Montreal. Boit said that idle speculation
just leads to more speculation.
"What if Cuba had pulled out?" he
asked. "People might say, 'Well, it was
too bad because we knew Juantorena was
going to win.' "
Boit plans to run against Juantorena
this month in Jamaica.
"I really don't know what kind of shape
he (Juantorena) is in. I should expect him

to be in good shape."
Not full potential
Boit admits that most world class run
ners, like Juantorena, have a slight edge
over him when they meet on the track.
"Juantorena has a little bit of an advan
tage over me because I am a student," Boit
said. "As a student, I have many other
things to do.
"1 cannot really get enough time to de
velop to my full potential. Although I try
to train with the other guys (on the Stan
ford track team) as frequently as possible,
1 can't fit in two workouts. 1 tried about
two weeks ago, but it completely failed. I
was late for class twice so 1 said 'forget
it.' "
Boit enjoys running with other people.
He tries to schedule at least one workout a
week with the Stanford track team.
Stanford a big help
"I think the Stanford track team really
has helped me a great deal. Coaches Mar
shall Clark and Fayton Jordan have really
helped me."
Boit enjoys running in the hills above
Stanford and hopes to come back next
year to train even though he will be done
with his studies this spring.
Looking ahead in running, Boit said
that he thinks he can compete on an in
ternational level for the next few years.
"I really want to use that time so I can
see how well I can do," he said.
While Boit has been in the United
States, he has formed some views on
foreign athletes competing for American
universities.
Foreign collegians
Recently, a number of American
coaches have come out with statements
against foreign runners competing on a
collegiate level because they have be
come a major factor in cross country and
track championships.
Boit said that the foreigners are an asset
to the collegiate track program in the Un
ited States.
"I think American kids benefit by run
ning against us," he said. "I don't think
it's a one-way sort of thing."
"I like to compete against different
people. Most of the time the American
kids like to run against me because I run
ahead and they follow me and when they
do so, they run a good time.
Foreign student-athletes
"They (the critics) look at us as foreign
athletes, 1 would like them to look at us as
foreign students . . . now, if you don't
want any foreign athletes, do you want
any foreign students?
"If a foreign student is going to school
are you going to isolate him and say, 'You
are not going to participate because you
come from another country?' "
Boit also feels that the NCAA is exert
ing some unfair pressure on athletes. He
said he thinks the NCAA should give
graduate students one or two more years
of eligibility, so long as he is a full-time
student.
Does that mean that Boit would like to
represent Stanford in track or cross coun
try?
"I would like to because, first of all, I
didn't complete my eligibility in the uni
versity ... I could have run another sea
son for Stanford."
