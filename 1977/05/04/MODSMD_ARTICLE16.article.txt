# alias drafts Hill in 3rd, McColl, Michel go later
## 
### Chris Baker 
Wide receiver Tony Hill, de
fensive tackle Duncan McColl
and kicker Mike Michel were the
only Stanford players selected in
the first five rounds of the Na
tional Football League college
draft yesterday.
Hill, the leading receiver in
school history, was the second
draft choice of the Dallas Cow
boys behind Heisman Trophy
winner Tony Dorsett. The Cow
boys traded their No. 14 slot in
the first round and three second
round selections for Seattle's No.
2 pick, so Hill was the 14th
player selected in the third
round.
McColl, a UPI All-American,
was selected in the fourth round
by the Washington Redskins.
But McColl is for all practical
purposes the Redskins' No. 1
draft pick, because Washington
coach George Allen traded away
the Redskins' selections for the
first three rounds.
Michel, who averaged 39.8
yards per punt last season and
made 12 of 27 field goal at
tempts, was chosen by the
Miami Dolphins in the fifth
round.
Big time
Reached at his parents' Long
Beach home Hill said, "The Dal
las Cowboys are a winning team
and I'm glad to be a part of the
organization. I would like to
contribute my two cents.
"It's a big transition going
from high school to college and
this will be even bigger. Every
athlete that you're playing
against was the best at his
school."
With seven rounds to be com
pleted today, quarterback Mike
Cordova, Alex Karakozoff and
Gary Anderson will probably be
selected.
Pac-8 players drafted
The Pacific-8, the conference
with the largest number of active
players in pro football, did very
well.
Three of the first five players
chosen were from USC. Heisman
Trophy runner up Ricky Bell
was the first player chosen in the
draft. Bell, who became the third
USC player to be picked first in
the last 10 years, will be reunited
with former Trojan coach John
McKay at Tampa Bay.
Seattle traded its second pick

to Dallas for the Cowboys' 14th
pick in the first round and three
second round draft choices. Dal
las used Seattle's No. 2 pick to
take Heisman Trophy winner
Tony Dorsett.
Offensive tackle Marvin Pow
ell, 6-foot-5, 265 pounds, was the
second USC player selected.
Powell went to the New York Jets
on the fourth pick. The New
York Giants then selected Trojan
defensive tackle Gary Jeter.
California offensive guard Ted
Albricht was the only other
Pac-8 player to be chosen in the
first round. Albricht was chosen
by Chicago.
USC linebacker David Lewis
was the first player chosen in the
second round. Lewis will be part
of "USC South" — the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers.
Cal wide receiver Wesley
Walker, who missed the latter
part of the season with a knee
injury, was the fifth player cho
sen in the second round. Walker
will go to the New York Jets. Cal
back-up quarterback Fred Besana

was selected by Buffalo in the
fifth round.
One other Bay area player
went in the first round. Wilson
Faumina, who has anchored the
San Jose State defensive line for
the past three years, was taken by
Atlanta on the 20th selection.

school."
With seven rounds to be com
pleted today, quarterback Mike
Cordova, Alex Karakozoff and
Gary Anderson will probably be
selected.
Pac-8 players drafted
The Pacific-8, the conference
with the largest number of active
players in pro football, did very
well.
Three of the first five players
chosen were from USC. Heisman
Trophy runner up Ricky Bell
was the first player chosen in the
draft. Bell, who became the third
USC player to be picked first in
the last 10 years, will be reunited
with former Trojan coach John
McKay at Tampa Bay.
Seattle traded its second pick

to Dallas for the Cowboys' 14th
pick in the first round and three
second round draft choices. Dal
las used Seattle's No. 2 pick to
take Heisman Trophy winner
Tony Dorsett.
Offensive tackle Marvin Pow
ell, 6-foot-5, 265 pounds, was the
second USC player selected.
Powell went to the New York Jets
on the fourth pick. The New
York Giants then selected Trojan
defensive tackle Gary Jeter.
California offensive guard Ted
Albricht was the only other
Pac-8 player to be chosen in the
first round. Albricht was chosen
by Chicago.
USC linebacker David Lewis
was the first player chosen in the
second round. Lewis will be part
of "USC South" — the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers.
Cal wide receiver Wesley
Walker, who missed the latter
part of the season with a knee
injury, was the fifth player cho
sen in the second round. Walker
will go to the New York Jets. Cal
back-up quarterback Fred Besana

was selected by Buffalo in the
fifth round.
One other Bay area player
went in the first round. Wilson
Faumina, who has anchored the
San Jose State defensive line for
the past three years, was taken by
Atlanta on the 20th selection.
