# U.S., Vietnam confer, seek diplomatic ties
## 
### 
Paris (AP) â€” Representatives of the
United States and Vietnam opened
formal negotiations yesterday on the
establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two governments.
An agreement is expected quickly.
The two delegations, headed by
Richard Holbrooke, U.S. assistant sec
retary of state for southeast Asian af
fairs, and Vietnam's deputy foreign
minister, Phan Hien, met for three
and-a-half hours in the newly-opened
Vietnamese embassy. They will meet
again today.
At the end of the meeting, Holbrooke
and Hien smilingly shook hands.
Holbrooke said "we had a frank,
friendly and very useful discussion."
Hien, standing beside the American
delegate, added smilingly in English:
"I have to agree with him."
A Vietnamese spokesman said no
details of the discussions would be
disclosed until the end of the talks,
possibly within two weeks.
The meetings will resume at the Vie
tnamese embassy today and the next
two meetings will be at the American
embassy, the spokesman said.
It was the first high-level contact be
tween the two governments since
Communist-led forces occupied the
South Vietnamese capital of Saigon
two years ago and the country was
reunified the following year.
Preconditions abandoned
Informed sources said earlier that
the two governments had cleared the
way toward establishing diplomatic
relations by abandoning the precondi
tions raised by each side.
The United States had demanded a
full accounting for 2500 Americans

missing-in-action in the Vietnam war,
while Hanoi had demanded theUnited
States lift its trade embargo and pay
more than $3 billion in war repara
tions.
During his official visit to France
last week. Premier Dong said the two
sides maintained these demands but
no longer regarded them as obstacles
to the establishment of diplomatic re
lations between Hanoi and
Washington.
Sources here said the two govern
ments would probably agree to set up
diplomatic relations at ambassadorial
level fairly quickly, and would then
use their respective embassies to pur
sue the search for the MIAs and talks
on possible American economic aid to
Hanoi.
It was assumed that the U.S. trade
embargo would be dropped or sub
stantially eased soon after an agree
ment to establish diplomatic relations.
Earlier yesterday, however, Hanoi's
official newspaper said an agreement
to normalize relations might not be
concluded until the United States ag
reed to give Vietnam the reconstruc
tion aid it has demanded.
Meanwhile, former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger said yesterday it
is "absolutely absurd" for Vietnam to
claim a right to U.S. economic aid
based cn the 1973 Vietnam peace ag
reement
Alleging that North Vietnam "broke
every provision" of that agreement in
its armed conquest of South Vietnam
two years ago, Kissinger said, "in
order of the many claims on U.S. re
sources, I would put those of Vietnam
in alphabetical order."
