Gov't ethics standards proposed
Washington — President Jimmy Carter cal
led on Congress yesterday to write tough new
ethical standards for the executive branch and
to provide for possible appointment of a tem
porary special prosecutor to deal with any fu
ture Watergate-style scandal.
Carter also called for creation of a new ethics
office in the Civil Service Commission to ride
herd on standards of conduct inside the execu
tive branch.
Both the House and the Senate adopted new
ethics codes this year for their own respective
chambers. Those codes do not provide for
criminal sanctions and the strongest penalties
are censure or expulsion.
Carter called for the following proposals to
be made law with criminal sanctions to deal
with conflicts of interest or abuse of the public
trust by executive branch officials:
—Empower a special court to appoint a tem
porary special prosecutor to handle any seri
ous allegations of misconduct against high
ranking executive branch officials.
—Create a new office of government ethics
in the Civil Service Commission.
—Require all policy-making officials to dis
close publicly all income, gifts, assets,
liabilities, financial transactions, and posi
tions held in business and professional organi
zations.
—Bar former government officials from mak
ing informal as well as formal contacts with the
agencies that once employed them for two
years, rather than the present one year, if the
matters involved had been under his responsi
bility.
Nixon interview to be dramatic
Washington — The television audience
watching the first post-resignation interview
of Richard Nixon about Watergate probably
won't include the former president.
"His practice in the past has been not to
watch himself on television," Nixon's top aide
said yesterday in San Clemente.
"After all." continued the aide, Col. Jack

Brennan, "he did this taping for almost 29
hours. He knows what he said."
Others who know what Nixon said predict a
dramatic show tonight.
"In the early part of the program, his Water
gate defense was shattered and the interesting
part follows from there," said James Reston Jr.,
who researched the Watergate portion for in
terviewer David Frost.
"I believe viewers will feel that this confron
tation tests the Nixon accounting of Watergate
in the way and with the intensity that it should
be tested," said Frost, a British television per
sonality.
Frost reportedly paid Nixon $600,000 and
promised a percentage of the profits. The
Watergate interview, first of four programs to
be shown in succeeding weeks, will go on the
air at 7:30 p.m. over most stations that agreed to
carry it.
The 155 stations that will carry the programs
are doing so on the barter system: Frost will get
$125,000 for each of five minutes of national
advertisements. The stations can pocket the
revenue they get from selling seven minutes of
commercials locally.
American tuna fleet will not sail
San Diego — The American tuna fleet, idled
for months in a dispute over the killing of por
poises, ended its preparations to put to sea
yesterday because of renewed feuding with
environmental ists.
The Environmental Defense Fund said its
members could not accept the compromise
worked out by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif),
which would have put observers on all fishing
boats and allowed 157,000 porpoises to be kil
led in the next 20 months.
Fishermen have refused to sail since Feb
ruary because of the 1977 limit of 59,060 por
poise fatalities and total ban on killing any of
the eastern spinner species imposed by the Na
tional Marine Fisheries Service.
Porpoises, air-breathing mammals which
swim with tuna, sometimes are caught in fish
ing nets and drown.
An attorney for one of the environmentalist

groups said 112,000 porpoises were killed last
year by U.S. fishermen. No restrictions are
placed on foreign fishermen.
The compromise worked out by Cranston
and agreed to by fishermen would permit the
accidental killing of as many as 13,000 of the
eastern spinner porpoises, which are listed as
an endangered species.
House, Senate agree on tax cut
Washington — House and Senate conferees
agreed yesterday on a new standard deduction
that would cut taxes for an estimated 47 mill
ion persons but boost the taxes of some 1.7
million single persons.
The spokesmen for the two chambers are
working out a compromise version of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's economic stimulus tax
bill, passed by the House and Senate in diffe
rent forms.
The conferees wrote into the compromise
standard deductions — used by those who do
not itemize their charitable gifts, local taxes
and other offsets to income — of $2200 for
single persons and $3200 for couples filing
jointly.
Debate on the deduction touched on the
quirk in present law known as the "marriage
penalty." Because of the way deductions now
are set up, a man and woman with comparable
incomes and using the standard deductions
pay more tax if they are marrieJ than if they
share quarters without legal ties.
The new standard deduction would reduce,
but not eliminate the "marriage penalty."
The new standard deduction would replace
the provision of present law that allows tax
payers who do not itemize to deduct 16 per
cent of their income, with a minimum of $1700
and a maximum of $2400 for single persons
and higher range for married couples.
The compromise ultimately agreed on must
go to the House and Senate for ratification.
Committee approves weapon bill
Washington — The Senate Armed Services
Committee approved yesterday a $35.89 bill

ion weapons procurement and research au
thorization bill, $127 million more than re
commended by President Jimmy Carter.
Chairman John Stennis (D-Miss.), an
nounced, however, that a proposed year end
reduction of 17,100 military personnel and
19,900 civilian employes in the Defense De
partment would cut the total $420.3 billion
defense budget which Carter proposed by $59
million.
The committee added $923 million to the
$5.8 billion requested for procurement of Navy
ships.
The addition included $81.6 million for pro
curement of nuclear propulsion items for a
fourth Nimitz class, 90,000-ton nuclear carrier
pending future determination whether to pro
ceed with more large carriers or develop a grea
ter number of smaller carriers.
For ships, the committee recommended au
thorization of the construction of two Trident
submarines and an attack submarine, a con
ventional destroyer to carrier the Aegis air de
fense system, two other destroyers, eight
guided missile frigates two fleet oilers and
three ocean tugs.
Cal frats to counter bad publicity
Berkeley — Fraternity groups moved yester
day to counter bad publicity they've received
in the wake of anti-Semitic incidents on the
University of California campus, once the
scene of protest marches for the Free Speech
Movement.
A committee of the lnter-fraternity-
Panhellenic Council scheduled a meeting to
consider sanctions against fraternities whose
members were involved.
In the most recent incident, a member of the
semi-secret Skull and Keys Club shouted "Hi
tler was right" as he passed by Chabad House, a
Hassidic Jewish community center established
five years ago along the university's fraternity
row.
Skull and Keys is an unofficial men's club,
described in a student newspaper editorial as a
hard-drinking association made up largely of
fraternity men.

Earlier incidents involved minor vandalism
at the Chabad House, including knocking
down a fence — later attributed to "hoodlums"
— and theft of a holy and valuable "ark cover."
The thief was somehow traced to a nearby
fraternity house, its return was demanded, and
next day the cover was tossed through an open
window.
Today's weather
Mostly fair but with occasional clouds
through today. Increasing clouds with a
chance of rain tonight. Chance of showers to
morrow. Lows tonight in the mid 40s to mid
50s. Highs both days in the 60s. Chance of rain
40 per cent tonight.
