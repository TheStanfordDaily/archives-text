# COSS/R reviews room rate hike
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
Recently announced room and board rates for next year
were discussed yesterday at a meeting of the Committee on
Student Services' subcommittee on residences (COSS/R).
In addition to the increase in board rates necessary to
compensate for the cost of living increases, the University
has done some reshuffling of rates for different 1 iving units.
One change is establishment of a $166 flat-rate utility fee
to be charged to all students. In the pjast, each cluster house
was charged individually depending on the amount of
energy used.
Now the utility cost for cluster residents will be averaged
with the utility cost for all residences.
The cluster houses' per capita use of steam and electricity
was much higher than that of other houses, explained Norm
Robinson, associate dean of student affairs.
According to Ed Scoles, director of housing and food
services, the change is designed to alleviate the cost in
equity which was working against the cluster houses.
Tim Ferguson, chairman of COSS/R, expressed concern
that the averaging of the costs would dissuade cluster house
residents from frugal use of energy.
However, Rob Robinson, resident fellow for Lagunita
Court contended, "the financial reward was not the primary
incentive causing people to conserve." He pointed to the
energy conservation experiment in I.agunita Court which is

working extremely well without any monetary benefits.
Scoles agreed with Robinson, saying that even as much as
a" 10 per cent decrease in utility use over a year would only
save each student a couple of dollars."
The ground rent charged to the four privately-owned
fraternity houses, Sigma Chi, Theta Xi, Phi Sig and Theta
Chi has also been raised for next year. The houses were
previously charged $180 for the cost of maintenance, sewer,
trash, residential education, health and safety, police pro
tection and fire insurance.
Next year, however, residents will be charged $217, sub
stantially more than that necessary to compensate for cost of
living increases.
In the past, privately owned student residences paid only
a partial residential education fee because they did not
receive as many benefits (such as a resident fellow or
academic programs) as the other houses.
However, the University now plans to increase the
charges for residential education in privately owned stu
dent residences.
Norm Robinson said the University feels the cost of resi
dential education should be averaged over the four years.
Each resident should pay a similar amount although the
actual cost of residential education is higher in freshmen
residences than in upper class ones.
