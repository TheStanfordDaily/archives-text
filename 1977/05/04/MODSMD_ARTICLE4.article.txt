# 450 march against S. Africa decision
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
About 450 demonstrators who
.marched on President Richard Ly
man's office yesterday afternoon, de
manding that the Board of Trustees re
consider its position on South Africa
resolutions, appear to have been de
nied their demand.
Lyman does not intend to recom
mend that trustees reconsider their de
cision to abstain from voting on
shareholder resolutions against in
vestment in South Africa, Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs told the Daily last night.
Rosenzweig had told the de
monstrators yesterday afternoon that
reconsideration would be unlikely. He
was speaking for Lyman who is in St.
Louis attending a Council on Founda
tions meeting.
Lyman's personal position is that it
would not be productive for American
business to get out of South Africa,
Rosenzweig said last night.
Demonstrators marched on Lyman's
office after a noon rally in White Plaza
protesting the trustees' abstentions
and Stanford's alleged complicity in

apartheid. The rally, organized by
Stanford Committee on Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP), attracted
over 700 protesters.
Rosenzweig, eating an icecream bar,
met the chanting, clapping protesters
outside Lyman's office. He was pre
sented with petitions bearing almost
3000 student and faculty signatures
calling for a yes vote by trustees on the
shareholder resolutions and a demand
to meet with the trustees investment
committee.
Rosenzweig promised the petitions
would be presented to the trustees.
"President Lyman will report to the
investment committee, of which he is a
member, exactly what has happened
here over the past few weeks," he said.
Rosenzweig said he didn't know
what trustees would do with that re
port, or whether Lyman would work
personally for reconsideration of the
issue. The trustees made their position
"quite clear and public" at the last
meeting, he said.
Responding to pointed questions by
the demonstrators, Rosenzweig told
them to continue to work as they have
been doing, and to work through the
system.
Even when you work through the
system, "you lose," he said. "That's
the way it works sometimes."
"I think 'that the process that exists
now is not an unreasonable one,"
Rosenzweig said in reference to the
Commission on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR).
"I don't know of a better representa
tive process that could be devised."
"I believe that in this University
students have an enormous ability to
establish the agenda of issues the in
stitution will consider," hecontinued.
But students have a much more re
stricted ability to make decisions on
those issues due to the nature of the
University, he added.
At the rally preceding the march,
SCRIP member Mike Jennings de
clared that the consensus deemed

necessary by the University for an af
firmative vote on the shareholder re
solutions does exist. If the trustees
abstention "isn't a blatant, categorical,
insensitive repudiation of that consen
sus, I don't know what is," he said.
"The fact is the administration and
trustees don't give a damn about com
munity consensus," Jennings said.
"This is not just a symptom of spring
fever among the rads," Anne Henkels,
ASSU Council of Presidents member
said at the rally. "This issue will not
die."
She cited the previous success of
student activism in obtaining coed
dorms, the SWOPSI and SCIRE prog
rams and removal of classified re
search and ROTC from campus.
Jennings rejected the trustees argu
ment that U.S. corporations act as a
progressive force in South Africa.
"Are we really to be taken as com
pletefools?" heasked. "Wecan't allow
the same insipid, worthless, ineffec
tive copout response to be given."
Previous speeches, including oneby
junior Kim McCall, who spent two
years as a missionary in South Africa,
detailed conditions for blacks under
apartheid.
McCall noted that people participat
ing in a rally like yesterday's in South
Africa would probably be arrested and
imprisoned without trial, as were 34
white students who attempted to or
ganize a protest rally in Johannesburg.
"The entire South African system is
diametrically opposed to the princi
ples of justice and decency, and Stan
ford ought not to have any part in it,"
he said.
Eleven Stanford organizations made
short statements of support for SCRIP,
including United Stanford Employees
(USE).
Speaking on behalf of the 1200 USE
members, Lise Giraud called USE the
University's "largest constituency"
who was protesting the trustees
abstentions "as human beings, for the
sake of our own dignity."
