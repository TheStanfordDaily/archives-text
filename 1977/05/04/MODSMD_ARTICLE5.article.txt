# Schlesinger defends Carter's energy plan

### 
Washington (AP) — White House
energy adviser James Schlesinger gave
President Jimmy Carter's energy prog
ram a formal sendoff in Congress yes
terday, claiming Americans will
be able to absorb the higher energy
costs.
While the president's program
might have some initial adverse effect
on the economy, Schlesinger said, its
long-run impact would be minimal
and would avert a future economic
crisis.
"Unless we get on with the job,
we're going to have a disaster,"
Schlesinger told the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee.
Schlesinger's appearance marked
the first timeanadministration official
has testified on the energy program
since the president unveiled it April
20 at a joint House-Senate session.
Committee Chairman Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.), predicted favorable action
on "most of those parts of the program
which will come to this committee."
But he said the administration must
first provide "convincing answers" to
how much actual energy would be
saved by the plan and what it will cost
the economy.
Schlesinger said the higher energy
costs called for by the legislation
would be passed on to consumers in
the form of higher prices for a variety
of products. But some of this will be

offset by an expected rise in per capita
income, he added.
"In terms of real income, there will
be no reduction" in Americans' buy
ing power, Schlesinger said. However,
he added, "we are going to some extent
change the style of American life."
He also noted that some of the higher
costs would be directly returned to
Americans through the program's
proposed system of direct tax rebates
and tax incentives.
Schlesinger urged Congress to con
sider the program — which contains
103 separate pieces of legislation — as
"a complex whole" and not to pick it
apart piece by piece or focus only on
the most controversial aspects.
He said the plan was carefully tai
lored to "distribute benefits and bur
dens equitably" and that Congress
should not attempt to alter this basic
thrust.
In three hours of testimony,
Schlesinger repeatedly defended
perhaps the most controversial ele
ment of the program: the standby
gasoline tax.
"What it will help to do is alter the
ingrained taste of the American
people," Schlesinger said.
The tax would be levied in yearly
five-cent a gallon increments begin
ning in 1979, up to a maximum of 50
cents a gallon, if gasoline consump
tion rises above specified federal
targets.
Schlesinger predicted a 50 to 60 per
cent chance the tax might be imposed
in any given year, but noted that
Americans could avoid it by using less
gas. "This represents the type of chal
lenge Americans have been so success
ful in meeting in the past and will
likely meet in the future," Schlesinger
said.
But committee members generally
expressed skepticism. Sen. Dale Bum
pers (D-Ark.) told Schlesinger the tax
"is a patently unfair method of trying
to conserve energy."
Meanwhile, congressional Democ
ratic leaders reportedly told Carter at a
White House breakfast that the gas tax
proposal might have a better chance of
passage if he scrapped the idea of giv
ing tax revenues back to Americans in
the form of rebates.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said
the congressional leaders proposed
the money be used instead for a range
of transportation programs and re
search into alternative forms of energy.
Cranston said the president listened
to the suggestions, but made no com
mitment.

crisis.
"Unless we get on with the job,
we're going to have a disaster,"
Schlesinger told the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee.
Schlesinger's appearance marked
the first timeanadministration official
has testified on the energy program
since the president unveiled it April
20 at a joint House-Senate session.
Committee Chairman Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.), predicted favorable action
on "most of those parts of the program
which will come to this committee."
But he said the administration must
first provide "convincing answers" to
how much actual energy would be
saved by the plan and what it will cost
the economy.
Schlesinger said the higher energy
costs called for by the legislation
would be passed on to consumers in
the form of higher prices for a variety
of products. But some of this will be

offset by an expected rise in per capita
income, he added.
"In terms of real income, there will
be no reduction" in Americans' buy
ing power, Schlesinger said. However,
he added, "we are going to some extent
change the style of American life."
He also noted that some of the higher
costs would be directly returned to
Americans through the program's
proposed system of direct tax rebates
and tax incentives.
Schlesinger urged Congress to con
sider the program — which contains
103 separate pieces of legislation — as
"a complex whole" and not to pick it
apart piece by piece or focus only on
the most controversial aspects.
He said the plan was carefully tai
lored to "distribute benefits and bur
dens equitably" and that Congress
should not attempt to alter this basic
thrust.
In three hours of testimony,
Schlesinger repeatedly defended
perhaps the most controversial ele
ment of the program: the standby
gasoline tax.
"What it will help to do is alter the
ingrained taste of the American
people," Schlesinger said.
The tax would be levied in yearly
five-cent a gallon increments begin
ning in 1979, up to a maximum of 50
cents a gallon, if gasoline consump
tion rises above specified federal
targets.
Schlesinger predicted a 50 to 60 per
cent chance the tax might be imposed
in any given year, but noted that
Americans could avoid it by using less
gas. "This represents the type of chal
lenge Americans have been so success
ful in meeting in the past and will
likely meet in the future," Schlesinger
said.
But committee members generally
expressed skepticism. Sen. Dale Bum
pers (D-Ark.) told Schlesinger the tax
"is a patently unfair method of trying
to conserve energy."
Meanwhile, congressional Democ
ratic leaders reportedly told Carter at a
White House breakfast that the gas tax
proposal might have a better chance of
passage if he scrapped the idea of giv
ing tax revenues back to Americans in
the form of rebates.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said
the congressional leaders proposed
the money be used instead for a range
of transportation programs and re
search into alternative forms of energy.
Cranston said the president listened
to the suggestions, but made no com
mitment.
Washington (AP) — White House
energy adviser James Schlesinger gave
President Jimmy Carter's energy prog
ram a formal sendoff in Congress yes
terday, claiming Americans will
be able to absorb the higher energy
costs.
While the president's program
might have some initial adverse effect
on the economy, Schlesinger said, its
long-run impact would be minimal
and would avert a future economic
crisis.
