Energy proposal
Don Barton (Daily, April 28)
praises President Carter for tak
ing energy leadership, then
criticizes his proposed gasoline
tax as government meddling.
I would like to point out that
Carter's proposal is an effort to
use free market mechanisms to
reduce consumption. It is true
that dwindling supply would
force up prices eventually and so
reduce consumption. But when?
What kind of climate is it for bus
iness and the American people
to know that adjustments are
going unmade?
To trust blindly to free market
mechanisms would be to risk
crises — perhaps catastrophe.
Better a little planning to pre
serve our long term freedom.

Reading yesterday's article in
the Daily, I was reassured to dis
cover that the Physics Depart
ment was consulted before-hand
concerning the construction of
Josef Alber's wall between the
Physics Tank and the Quad.
After all. I'd hate to think of them
looking out their office windows
every day at a wall which they
opposed.
There was, however, one as
pect of the article which
bothered me. Whatever hap
pened to student input? Doesn't
the fact that thousands of stu
dents cross that area every day
on their way to class obligate the
University to obtain their opin
ion?
Or does the administration
just assume that we would be
glad to have a wall in this area so
people would stop gathering
there to sun themselves or play
frisbee?

This product of the Universi
ty's agoraphobia should be stop
ped immediately. Open, grass
covered areas around campus
are gradually becoming fewer
and farther between. Although I
don't profess to be a critic, it
seems to me that an open lawn is
a much greater work of "art"
than a nine by fifty-four foot
wall, regardless of where the
materials come from.
Judging from the student reac
tion I've received in the last day,
1 would say that most of my fel
lows agree with me.
There are already enough
"walls" on this campus between
the diverse groups which consti
tute i's pupulation without
spending $50,000 to $90,000 to
build one of granite. If I want to
see a wall I'll go to China or Ger
many.
As lor having one at Stanford,
I'd rather the University spent
the money to build a nine by
fifty-four foot hole in which to
bury some of its bad ideas.

Entrapment
The letter sent by the Florence
Moore residence staff (Daily,
April 29) complaining about the
"entrapment" tactics that Stan
ford Christians use seemed to us
an unprovoked attack on Inter-
Varsity and other Christian
groups at Stanford.
The letter accused Inter-
Varsity of not acknowledging
the "true nature and intent of
their shaky efforts ... to Christ
ianize the audience." In our de
alings with the group, we have
found that this intent simply
does not exist.
Rather, the intent of Inter-
Varsity (in relation to the Lewis
Memorial Lecture Series, under
which the Schaffer films were
presented) is "to build an under

standing of the Christian faith,
it's truth and relevance, (and to
make it) possible for interested
Non-Christians to investigate
Christianity on a regular basis,
with intellectual integrity, un
threatened by 'hard-sell
techniques ' "
Inter-Varsity gives the Stan
ford community the opportunity
to investigate the validity of the
claims of Christ, and leaves us to
our own conclusions. We think
that their efforts are not only jus
tifiable, but praiseworthy.

glad to have a wall in this area so
people would stop gathering
there to sun themselves or play
frisbee?

This product of the Universi
ty's agoraphobia should be stop
ped immediately. Open, grass
covered areas around campus
are gradually becoming fewer
and farther between. Although I
don't profess to be a critic, it
seems to me that an open lawn is
a much greater work of "art"
than a nine by fifty-four foot
wall, regardless of where the
materials come from.
Judging from the student reac
tion I've received in the last day,
1 would say that most of my fel
lows agree with me.
There are already enough
"walls" on this campus between
the diverse groups which consti
tute i's pupulation without
spending $50,000 to $90,000 to
build one of granite. If I want to
see a wall I'll go to China or Ger
many.
As lor having one at Stanford,
I'd rather the University spent
the money to build a nine by
fifty-four foot hole in which to
bury some of its bad ideas.

Entrapment
The letter sent by the Florence
Moore residence staff (Daily,
April 29) complaining about the
"entrapment" tactics that Stan
ford Christians use seemed to us
an unprovoked attack on Inter-
Varsity and other Christian
groups at Stanford.
The letter accused Inter-
Varsity of not acknowledging
the "true nature and intent of
their shaky efforts ... to Christ
ianize the audience." In our de
alings with the group, we have
found that this intent simply
does not exist.
Rather, the intent of Inter-
Varsity (in relation to the Lewis
Memorial Lecture Series, under
which the Schaffer films were
presented) is "to build an under

standing of the Christian faith,
it's truth and relevance, (and to
make it) possible for interested
Non-Christians to investigate
Christianity on a regular basis,
with intellectual integrity, un
threatened by 'hard-sell
techniques ' "
Inter-Varsity gives the Stan
ford community the opportunity
to investigate the validity of the
claims of Christ, and leaves us to
our own conclusions. We think
that their efforts are not only jus
tifiable, but praiseworthy.

praises President Carter for tak
ing energy leadership, then
criticizes his proposed gasoline
tax as government meddling.
I would like to point out that
Carter's proposal is an effort to
use free market mechanisms to
reduce consumption. It is true
that dwindling supply would
force up prices eventually and so
reduce consumption. But when?
What kind of climate is it for bus
iness and the American people
to know that adjustments are
going unmade?
To trust blindly to free market
mechanisms would be to risk
crises — perhaps catastrophe.
Better a little planning to pre
serve our long term freedom.

Reading yesterday's article in
the Daily, I was reassured to dis
cover that the Physics Depart
ment was consulted before-hand
concerning the construction of
Josef Alber's wall between the
Physics Tank and the Quad.
After all. I'd hate to think of them
looking out their office windows
every day at a wall which they
opposed.
There was, however, one as
pect of the article which
bothered me. Whatever hap
pened to student input? Doesn't
the fact that thousands of stu
dents cross that area every day
on their way to class obligate the
University to obtain their opin
ion?
Or does the administration
just assume that we would be
glad to have a wall in this area so
people would stop gathering
there to sun themselves or play
frisbee?
