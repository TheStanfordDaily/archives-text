# Interview belies war horrors

The first David Frost-Richard
Nixon interview appears on TV
tonight, and that fact is of the
most bitter irony. Today also
marks the seventh anniversary of
the killings at Kent State. Ni
xon's role in Watergate will
surely be the prime topic of con
troversy in the interviews with
Frost. Will Vietnam even be dis
cussed? Will Nixon continue to
maintain after all those years of
bloodshed and hypocrisy the
nobility of our effort there, the
purity of his own participation
in the carnage?
This time of the year is filled
with so many tragic memories of
the war, so many heartbreaking
images we saw on the evening
news and in our newspapers.
They flood through the mind all
at once, and then separately,
tearing ever more at one's emo
tions.
It was on April 30, 1970, that
Nixon invaded Cambodia with
American troops. Announcing

on TV this "incursion," as he
steadfastly called it, he said the
U.S. would not act like "a pitiful,
helpless giant."
It was an ignoble speech he
gave that night, speaking once
again of the need to save this
country's credibility, displaying
charts and maps that pointed out
supposed North Vietnamese
sanctuaries that were never to be
found.
Until the invasion, Cambodia
had been a virtual paradise, a
rare marvel of nature remaining
from an age that has so swiftly
passed us by.
It was four days later. May 4,
1970, that four students were
shot down at Kent State and sev
eral others wounded, one
paralyzed for life.
And finally, it was April 30,
1975 that the end finally came to
the wrr. Once more we saw it
all on the evening news prog
rams: bodies of Vietnamese or
phans dead from the crash of a

cargo plane, civilians running
from another plane and being
shot down by fleeing South Vie
tnamese soldiers.
All that is behind us now; de
spite the merciless efforts of
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Kissinger,
and the rest, peace is finally at
hand.
And so when we see Nixon
being interviewed on TV in the
weeks to come, playing down
his role in Watergate and talking
so easily and so guiltlessly about
Vietnam, we must not forget the
horror of all the years of war.
Though Nixon and our other
leaders do not recognize it, Viet
nam destroyed forever the myth
of American benevolence and
made clear to all the world, and
to millions of Americans as well,
that we had met the enemy, as
Pogo once said, and it was us.

The first David Frost-Richard
Nixon interview appears on TV
tonight, and that fact is of the
most bitter irony. Today also
marks the seventh anniversary of
the killings at Kent State. Ni
xon's role in Watergate will
surely be the prime topic of con
troversy in the interviews with
Frost. Will Vietnam even be dis
cussed? Will Nixon continue to
maintain after all those years of
bloodshed and hypocrisy the
nobility of our effort there, the
purity of his own participation
in the carnage?
This time of the year is filled
with so many tragic memories of
the war, so many heartbreaking
images we saw on the evening
news and in our newspapers.
They flood through the mind all
at once, and then separately,
tearing ever more at one's emo
tions.
It was on April 30, 1970, that
Nixon invaded Cambodia with
American troops. Announcing

on TV this "incursion," as he
steadfastly called it, he said the
U.S. would not act like "a pitiful,
helpless giant."
It was an ignoble speech he
gave that night, speaking once
again of the need to save this
country's credibility, displaying
charts and maps that pointed out
supposed North Vietnamese
sanctuaries that were never to be
found.
Until the invasion, Cambodia
had been a virtual paradise, a
rare marvel of nature remaining
from an age that has so swiftly
passed us by.
It was four days later. May 4,
1970, that four students were
shot down at Kent State and sev

And finally, it was April 30,
