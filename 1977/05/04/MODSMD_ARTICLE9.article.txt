## The 						drive for equal protection

Equality of rights under the law
shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States or by any
state on account of sex.
Proposed 27th Amendment
On March 22, 1972, 49 years
alter its initial introduction the
now celebrated Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) was ap
proved by the Senate in the lan
guage quoted above. Within one
year of Congressional approval,
30 of the necessary 38 states
ratified the Amendment.
Five years later, however, the
ERA still awaits ratification by at
least three states before it be
comes the supreme law of the
land.
The story may seem like a
simple one but only deceptively
so, for perhaps more than any
piece of legislation since the
Voting Rights Act of 1964, the
ERA has aroused both ardent
support and equally ardent op
position while maintaining a

general level of confusion and
controversy,
The purpose of the ERA is
quite clear — to eliminate the
role of sex as a determining fac
tor in the legal rights of men and
women, or in a familiar phrase to
"promote equality under the
law." In a nation that prides it
self on the fact that "all 'men' are
created equal" and in the tradi
tion of the sth, 14th and 19th
Amendments, the adoption,
ratification and enactment of
this proposal seem only a natural
course.
And yet the ERA has faced
serious opposition culminating
in the rescission of the Amend
ment in Tennessee, Nebraska
and Idaho, and the ERA's defeat
last week in Florida. Why has
this simple 52 word Amendment
merely demanding equal justice
for all citizens inspired so much
debate? History may shed some
light on this question.
In 1923, the first proposal for a
constitutional amendment
guaranteeing equal rights for
men and women was introduced
to Congress. The proposal was
shuffled from one committee to
another, from table to table and
then carefully lost in Congress
where it laid buried in bureauc
racy for decades.
And so the current political
struggle — ratification by three
fourths of the states. The past
five years have intensified the
level of debate and presented the
American public with several
key problems, counter-problems
and potential solutions.
The necessity of adopting the
ERA is evidenced by the consid
erable remnants of discrimina
tion that women face.
In 1970, three-fourths of all
full time working women re
ceived less than $6000 annually
while only one-third of full time
working men were in the same
base-level situation. This may be
due in part to the less developed
job skills of women but the major
part of the differential can be
blamed on past discrimination.
As a result of these and other
factors, 60 per cent of poor
families are headed by women.
In addition, the wage gap bet

ween men and women with the
same education increases with
the amount of education re
ceived.
The situation does not seem to
be improving — in 1955 an aver
age full time working woman
made 64 per cent of the salary of
her male counterpart; in 1970
that figure decreased to 59 per
cent and it rests at that level to
day.
Discrimination also extends to
the political arena. Women ac
count for the majority of regis
tered voters and yet they make
up a small minority of national,
state and local officials.
Discrimination of any sort is
an evil which cannot be toler
ated in a free society. Certain
provisions such as the Equal Fay
Act of 1963 have attempted to
ameliorate this situation, but by
and large they have been ineffec
tual and unenforceable.
The ERA promises to provide
a constitutional precedent
guaranteeing equality under the
law. In principle, the ideal goals
outlined by the ERA cannot be
denied — to extend equal rights
to all citizens surely remains our
highest ethical, moral and con
stitutional responsibility.
In practicality, the ERA would
offer the federal backing so
needed to enforce the provisions
and statutes guaranteeing equal
opportunity to all Americans.
The broad language of the
Amendment itself has proven to
be the major area of opposition
as it leaves much room for misin
terpretation. Opponents of the
ERA stress arguments ranging
from Senator Sam Ervin's belief
in 1972 that it would "destroy
the social fabric of America," to
the fear of "unisex" public re
strooms.
The more legitimate concerns
are that women might face com
pulsory military service, protec
tive and exemptive rights of
women might be limited as in
special labor protection laws
and family support laws and the
ERA may not add any rights
which do not already exist under
the 14th Amendment.
Mandatory conscription and
other arguments are merely un-

substantiated fears. First, there is
no military draft, and a qualified
woman should have as much
right as a man to volunteer for
the service of her country.
Second, if the draft were
reinstated, Congress could set
up "sex neutral exemptions"
such as parental exemptions
which apply to fathers or
mothers. In addition, the current
"sex neutral" physical standards
such as rigorous exercise, condi
tioning and endurance qualifica
tions would virtually eliminate
the possibility of women reach
ing active combat duty.
As far as protective laws are
concerned the ERA would not
eliminate them, but rather it
would extend them to include
both men and women. For
example in the case of alimony
and child support, the obligation
for payment will rest upon the
husband or wife that has the gre
ater ability to provide for the
children.

Under the 14th Amendment,
due process and equal protec
tion of the law have been ex
tended to all citizens. However,
the Supreme Court has yet to
rule that discrimination on the
basis of gender is a denial of fun
damental rights, nor has it Jield
that sex is an aspect of suspect
classification. Women are left
unprotected in many states
against discrimination for jobs,
housing and public service.
The ERA provides a reasona
ble answer to the current prob
lem of sex discrimination. Its
goal is not to make us all equal —
even the strongest ERA suppor
ters admit that there are inherent
differences between men and
women, and rightly so (thank
goodness). The ERA does, how
ever, establish a constitutional
basis for equal opportunity and
equal protection.
