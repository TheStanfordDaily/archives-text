# Nixon admits he brought himself down

### 
Washington (AP) — Richard
Nixon broke his long silence on
Watergate last night, conceding "I
let down my friends, 1 let down the
country, 1 let down our system of
government."
But, 1000 days after he resigned
in disgrace over the Watergate
scandal, the former president in
sisted he did not obstruct justice.
"1 did not commit, in my view, an
impeachable offense," he declared.
His eyes glistening at times dur
ing the climactic minutes of a paid
for interview with British television
personality David Frost, Nixon ad
mitted he lied in some of his public
statements while in office.
And Nixon said he considered
resigning in April 1973 —15
months before he did so, but he said
he remained in office to insure his
foreign policy momentum would
continue.
A conspiracy
Nixon said friends have
suggested that there was a conspi
racy to oust him, but "I don't go
with the idea."
"I brought myself down," said
the 37th president, the first to res
ign the office. "I gave 'em a sword
and they stuck in in and they
twisted it with relish."
He added: "I guess if I'd been in
their position, I'd have done the
same thing."
The former president was alter
natively combative, hesitant, con
trite and somber. He smiled only
infrequently, in the tense manner so
familiar to Americans during his
aborted tenure.
Only when acknowledging "my
political life is over" did Nixon's
voice crack slightly.
'Big issues'
"I said tilings that were not true,"
he told Frost, but he said that didn't
apply to the "big issues" of the
scandal.
Again, as he did all through the

heat of Watergate, Nixon main
tained he was not involved in the
break-in at Democratic headquar
ters at the Watergate on June 17,
1972. And he denied that he had
participated in or approved the
payment of hush money to the burg
lars.
That is exactly what he said when
he was trying to save his embattled
presidency in the face of impeach
ment resolutions just before he res
igned.

'I let down my friends,
I let down the country,
I let down our system
of gov't'

Of the hush money payments,
Nxon said: "It's possible it's a mis
take that I didn't stop it."
"It was so botched up," he said of
the way Watergate was handled by
his administration. "1 made so
many bad judgments; the worst
ones, mistakes of the heart, rather
than the head."
Tangled into legalisms
Frost and Nixon got tangled into
legalisms over what constituted
obstruction of justice and Nixon
called the interviewer "attorney for
the prosecution."
That is exactly the way Frost's
staff had characterized his interro
gation of Nixon at a rented house
near San Clemente. One researcher
said the interview was designed as
a substitute for the trial Nixon never
had.
Indeed, Frost bored in, asking
Nixon to admit to wrongdoing, to
abuse of his office and to say "I put
the American people through two
years of needless agony and I

apologize for that."
Nixon recalled that when he
asked for the resignations of his top
aides, H.R. Haldeman and John
Ehrlichman in late April 1973, he
considered resigning too. But, he
said, he stayed in office because of
his concerns about approaches to
China and the Soviet Union and the
Vietnam peace agreement.
'Didn't make mistakes'
"I didn't make mistakes in this
period," Nixon said, adding that
with the pressures of investigations
by Congress and Watergate pro
secutors "1 said things that were not
true."
For that, he said, he has deep re
gret.
"It snowballed. And, it was my
fault. I'm not blaming anybody
else," he added. "I'm simply saying
to you that as far as I'm concerned, I
not only regret it: I indicated my
own beliefs in this matter when 1
resigned. People didn't think it was
enough to admit mistakes, fine. It
they want me to get down and
grovel on the floor, no. Never."
He said he does not believe there
was a conspiracy against him, but
he said "I don't know what the CIA
had to do. Some of their shenani
gans have yet to be told, according
to a book I read recently."
Neither, he said, does he know
what was going on in what he cal
led "the impeachment lobby."
Might have won
Nixon said he might have won in
a Senate impeachment trial, but
that would have left the country
without a full-time president. It was
the same refrain he sounded when
he announced his resignation, say
ing then that he had lost his politi
cal base.
"I have impeached myself, that
speaks for itself," he said. "By res
igning, that was a voluntary im
peachment...you're wanting me to
say that I participated in an illegal

cover-up? No."
Much of the Frost interview con
cerned the meeting Nixon had with
the counsel to the president, John
Dean, in the Oval Office on March
21, 1973 —the day Dean laid out for
him the deep cover-up involvement
of Nixon's top aide in the now
famed "cancer on the presidency"
speech.
Said Nixon:
"During that period, I will admit,
that I started acting as lawyer for

their defense. I will admit that act
ing as lawyer for their defense, I was
not prosecuting the case.
Law enforcement
"I will admit that during that
period, rather than acting primarily
in my role as the chief law enforce
ment officer in the united States, or
at least with responsibility for the
law enforcement...that I did not
meet that responsibility....
"I came to the edge, and under
the circumstances, I would have to

say that a reasonable person could
call that a cover-up. I didn't intend
it as a cover-up. Let me say, if I in
tended to cover-up, believe me, I'da
done it.
"You knowhowlcouldadoneit?
So easily. 1 could have done it im
mediately after the election simply
by giving clemency to everybody
and the whole thing would have
gone away.
"I couldn't do that because I said
'Clemency was wrong.'"
"I let down my friends. I let down
the country. 1 let down our system
of government and the dreams of all
those young people that ought to
get into government but think, it's
all too corrupt and the rest..,
'Carry that burden'
"1 let the American people down,
and 1 have to carry that burden with
me for the rest of my life. My politi
cal life is over...as far as the handl
ing of this matter is concerned, it
was so botched up. I made so many
bad judgments."
Nixon insisted that he knew no
thing of the cover-up until Dean's
recitation March 21.
This exchange followed:
Frost: "In that case, if that was the
first occasion, why did you say in
such strong terms to Colson on Feb
ruary 14th, which is a month be
fore...'The cover-up is the main in
gredient; that's where we gotta cut
our losses; my losses are to be cut;
the president's loss has got to be cut
on the cover-up deal.'?"
Nixon: "Why did I say that?"
Frost: "February 14th."
Nixon: "Well, because I read the
American papers...they were talk
ing about 'hush money.' They were
talking about clemency pay for
cover-up, and all the rest. It was
that, that 1 was referring to at that
point. I was referring to the fact that
there was a lot of talk about cover
up and that this must be avoided at
all cost."
