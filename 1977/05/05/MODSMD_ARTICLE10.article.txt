# ROTC: Class in obedience

Suppose there existed an
academic department here
which used an unusual
and effective method for promot
ing a high degree of enthusiasm,
unity of purpose and develop
ment of the correct attitudes
among its students.
Instead of giving students who
refused to fully adhere to such
standared relatively innocuous
indications of disapproval, such
as low grades or poor recom
mendations, it could instead
force these students after gradu
ation to enter an occupation so
dangerous that the six-month
survival rate was about 25 per
cent.
On the other hand, those who
developed and espoused the ac
cepted standards and attitudes
would be give a shiny, colorful
piece of metal to wear over their
right shirt pockets; this piece of
metal would shield them from
such an occupation. (In fact, this
piece of metal could even be
shaped like a shield.)
Suppose that students in
either category were also forbid
den to leave the department if

they had been enrolled for more
than two years. If one insisted on
leaving anyway, he would still
be forced to enter the 75 per cent
mortality rate occupation, pos
sibly as a subordinate of a de
partment graduate who was also
there because he failed to de
velop the desired qualities.
Relax (for Yiow, anyway).
There is no such department on
this campus. Stanford formerly
sponsored one, but phased it out,
as did many other private uni
versities and colleges with simi
lar departments, following the
uproar caused by other
graduates of these departments.
During this upheaval, the
University's image-conscious
department was unable to en
force viably the prohibition
against leaving after two years.
To be more specific, the Uni
versity's army ROTC program
during the height of the Vietnam
war kept close watch on various
"leadership" qualities exhibited
by ROTC cadets.
These qualities invariably in
cluded enthusiasm, "military
bearing," aggressiveness during

the mock battle drills in the
foothills and during the third
year summer camp held at Fort
Lewis, Wash., and participation
in extracurricular ROTC ac
tivities such as the "Stanford
Rangers" (the counter
insurgency club) and the drill
team. The application of such
criteria could influence a cadet's
lifestyle in diverse ways, like
discouraging them from joining
certain political organizations or
expressing unpopular (with the
army at least) viewpoints in a
Daily column or letter to the
editor.
One navy ROTC instructor
here once even went so far as to
openly order students not to en
roll in classes at the (now
defunct) Midpeninsula Free
University because of the
"Communist" influence there.
The army ROTC does indeed
award a shiny piece of metal
known as the Distinguished
Military Student (DMS) award to
the cadets who, in its opinion,
have competitively honed their
"leadership" skills to the high
est degree.
These awards are given after
the cadets have had a chance to
express a first, second and third
choice of which branch of the
army to which they wish to be
assigned.
Now, the DMS badge: every
year, by coincidence, all the re
cipients of the DMS award were
assigned their first (usually non
combat) branch choices while
nearly all of the remaining 80 to
90 per cent of the cadets were
assigned 4o combat branches,
some of which were neither a
cadet's first, second or even third
choice. The message to ROTC
cadets was clear, and might well
have been crudely phrased,
"Shape up, or we'll send you to
'Nam as an infantry lieutenant."
So subtly practiced was this
form of coercion that its use was
little known outside the ROTC

ranks. Even the Stanford "Off-
ROTC" movement of the late
'60s and early '70s was totally
unaware of this until very late in
the struggle. It was consequently
a very obscure issue, eclipsed by
more clearly identifiable ones
highlighted by the Vietnam War.
Now that we are no longer ac
tively and directly involved in a
foreign war, the stakes in ROTC
are not as high, and there is no
longer a military draft to encour
age enrollment in ROTC. Cam
pus tensions have even eased
since 1970, and ROTC appears to
be making a comeback here. And
yet I can't help but wonder if the
ROTC still uses these subtly
coercive techniques on its cadets
to generate such apparent en
thusiasm as expressed in the
April 7 Daily article, which
quoted statements from cadets
like, "So far, it's been what I
expectedâ€”and yes, I intend to
continue, scholarship or not,"
and "1 like the program, I like
what we're doing." Maybe the
cadet who has spurred the "Re
store ROTC" activities here
since 1973 will even be awarded
a DMS badge for his efforts and
will be assigned the branch of
his choice.
ROTC now has its foot in the
door. The University of Santa
Clara Army ROTC classes are
taught here. Continued compla
cence about its presence will re
sult in its return to campus as a
sanctioned, non-credit activity
in a few years. Several years la
ter, academic credit will be
granted after those who origi
nally objected during the late
'60s to its presence have dwin
dled in number. The 1970s will
be only an embarassing gap in
the history of ROTC here; a Uni
versity department, its orders
emanating from Washington,
will continue to disburse its tin
badges of obedience.
