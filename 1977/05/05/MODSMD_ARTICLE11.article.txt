Dear Duca,
My friend has returned to
Stanford after a two-year sojourn
with the Rev. Moon sect in
Booneville, an experience which
by not quite breaking him
spiritually, actually made him
stronger. He has now lost his
mesmerized, plastic smile of
tranquility, and has reassumed
his former identity, that of a har
ried student. The question is this
â€” for my friend and I, in a time of
shifting morality and illusive al
legiances, what are we to hold on
to?
Very truly yours,
A Student
P.S. This is the must difficult
question in the world, but ans

wer it for us in the Daily, if you
can. If you cannot, I will under
stand. But do try, and be our
pedagogic guide for a moment.
And remember, as much as we
learn through a teacher's exam
ple, we learn as much by criticiz
ing his opinion, and disagree
ment for us may only hide an
essential agreement in thought
Dear "Student,"
Indeed, this is a difficult ques
tion, not only because it relates
to a spiritual problem in general,
but also because it touches you
directly. I gather that since your
friend has spent two years with
Reverent Moon's movement, he
must have found in Booneville
the answers to some inner urges

and quests.
On the other hand, con
sidering the fact that he has left
the place, he had eventually de
cided that the day had come to
turn from a "mesmerized" to a
"harried" student.
Also, there are no pat answers,
except this: the truth most prob
ably lies somewhere between the
two above-mentioned attitudes.
Do you remember the words:
"Please God, give us some
thing. . . ."? Your friend, after
finding part of what he was seek
ing should now, in his new
hypostasis, JUST WAIT. Con
sidering the quality of his inner
structure, I know that he WILL
find the way, helped by your
love and friendship.
As you see, this is not a solu
tion, but merely an affectionate
suggestion.
DUCA'
