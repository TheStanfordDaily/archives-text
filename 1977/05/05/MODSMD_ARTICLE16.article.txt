## Theatre/keith phelge ACT production of 'Peer Gynt' good news for theatre-goers 
### 
The American Conservatory
Theatre re-introduced Peer Gynt
to its repertoire nine days ago, an
event which should be taken as
good news by all Hay Area
theatre-goers. Allen Fletcher's
superb direction of the Henrik
Ibsen play in verse and Daniel
Davis' acting in the title role
make for drama at its genuine
best â€” praise rendered the more
significant by the difficult na
ture of the epic fantasy.
Peer Gynt was not, as first
written, intended for production
on the stage. Authored in 1887
when Ibsen was :19, Gynt fol
lowed on the heels of the
Norwegian playwright's first
success, the verse drama, Brand.
It was started as lightly
conceived, poetic musing on
several themes from Norwegian
folklore and was intended only
to divert the author as he pre
pared himself for his next seri
ous dramatic undertaking.
When he at last decided to de
vote his full effort to the work.
Ibsen maintained the format of
dramatic dialogue but wrote
with no other constraints. The
finished manuscript was too
long and complex, in the au
thor's opinion, to lie adapted for
thg stage. In addition, Ibsen felt
that Peer Gynt was too Norwe
gian to be understood outside
Scandanavia.
Yet these obstacles were even
tually overcome by creative
theatrical producers and suc
cessful stage adaptations have
been rendered in Norwegian and
a multitide of other languages.
The very necessity of abridge
ment enables translators to shift
the work's emphasis as they see
fit for their time and country.
Streamlined
And this is the first point on
which ACT'sGynt triumphs. Di
rector Fletcher's translation,
while running to three and a half
hours, is remarkably stream

lined yet full-bodied. An unmis
takably Norwegian flavor pre
vails, but this enhances the cre
dibility of the staging and
creates no sort of cultural obsta
cle.
And indeed, there is little un
iquely Norwegian in the bare
plot of Peer Gynt. The story of
the youth of slender means who
dreams of fortune and fame, who
attains these ends only to realize
that they are empty illusions and
true riches are to be found only
in the soul, is as universal as
greed and ambition. And while
Ibsen enlarged on this theme to
the greatest extent possible, the
ultimate success of the play de
pends largely on those who in

terpret and convey Gynt to the
audience.
And this is the second point
on which ACT's Gynt makes
good. While it is true that the
actor who plays Peer determines
to a large degree the success of
the production, a solid support
ing cast is indispensable. Fortu
nately, supporting players are
one of ACT's strong points.
Alternating moods
Joy Carl in, in the part of Aase,
captured admirably the alternat
ing moods of Peer's mother:
pride in her son, doubt in her
own rearing of him; confidence
in his abilities, distrust of other's
perception of his worth; hope for
his future, wariness of a world

which has allotted her nothing
but hardship. Her scenes tended
to drag, but, this criticism ex
cepted, she gave a fine perfor
mance.
Fault might be found wtih
Francine lacker's portrayal of
Solveig, Peer's enduring true
love, on the grounds that she
under-acted tlie part. But the
playwright wrote so much shy
ness and diffidence into the
character that a Norwegian
feminist of Ibsen's day was of
fended by her passivity and de
clared that a more forceful
female would have aided Peer's
development.
The assignment of more than
one part to several of the actors.

while not called for specifically
by Ibsen, was a very effective de
vice. Much of the play's intri
cacy depends on the juxtaposi
tion of events in the fairytale at
mosphere of a troll kingdom with
those taking place in "real" life;
Franchelle Stewart Dorn's ap
pearance as a figure in Peer's
early life and re-appearance,
thinly disguised but retaining
the same mannerisms, as a troll
princess was subtly thought
provoking. Her parts called
chietly for lust and outrage, of
which she delivered an abun
dance.
Similarly effective was Joseph
Bird as a farmer and a troll king.
Agility
But, as previously noted, the
efforts of the supporting cast
would be for nought without a
strong Peer. The part is difficult
on account of the necessity to
portray the maturation of a com
plex character from youth to old
age. The acting agility required
for such a development is
enough to challenge the most
consummate players. (The most
memorable interpretations to
date have been those of Ralph
Richardson in the 1944 London
production and Max von Sydow
in Ingmar Bergman's 1957
Malmo production.)
It is thus to Davis' credit that
he held the stage for almost four
hours without a trace of strain or
effort. His rendering of Peer's
spiritual development achieved
just the right mixture of superfi
cial change and deep-seated
stasis. He shifted with apparent
ease through the bewildering
gamut of Peer's moods and
brought a warmth to the part
truly affecting. He deserved a
standing ovation, in this re
viewer's opinion, and

doubtlessly would have re
ceived one had not the audience
been caught in the inevitable
torpor attendant upon sitting in
one place for an entire evening.
The problems of set and scene
changes were handled in an
original and wonderfully simple
way by the ingenious expedient
of employing live scenery: on
the uncluttered wooden set were
arrayed players dressed in black
and white and holding approp
riate props (tree branches to rep

resent a forest, for example).
Their mute participation in each
scene helped create the
fairytale-world effect after
which Fletcher was striving.
Despite several briefly comic
scenes, the theatre-goer should
be warned that ACT's Peer Gynf
is not light entertainment. He
should not attend the produc
tion expecting to be diverted
with no mental effort. Yet if he is
seeking an evening of fine, seri
ous drama, he will not be disap
pointed.
