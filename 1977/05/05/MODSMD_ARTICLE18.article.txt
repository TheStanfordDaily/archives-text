## 'Mousetrap' fails to capture 
### 
Agatha Christie's The Mouset
rap has been playing at London's
Ambassador Theatre since 1952,
making it the longest-running
production in British theater his
tory. Less effective than her Wit
ness/or the Prosecution, the play
is nonetheless replete with the
spine-tingling intricacies which
have made Agatha Christie's
reputation as the queen of
murder-mystery. Miss Christie
in this work uses familiar tools
— and her craftsmanship shows
— but producing Mousetrap is
yet a delicate business. If hand
led incorrectly, the characters
can degenerate into cartoon
exaggerations, the suspense into
absurdity, and the denouement
of the mystery into a sudden,
cute and pedestrian wrapping
up.
The production of Mousetrap
currently playing at the Alcazar
Theater falls prey to each of
these "traps" to one extent or
another, and will be a disap
pointment to anyone who wore
out the edge of a seat at the Am
bassador in London.
The plot of the play is classic
Agatha Christie. A young couple
has just opened a snow-bound
boarding house. Just arrived are
five singularly eccentric indi
viduals who may or may not be
involved with a murder just re
ported by the on-stage radio.
Soon a young detective arrives
— on skis no less — and another
murder is accomplished, this
one (almost) before our eyes.
From here on the clues come
fast, and soon all are suspect.
There are, it seems, too many
clues even for Miss Christie to
handle, and to our disappoint
ment, many turn out to be red
herrings. Hence the play's great
weakness. One feels a bit
cheated after so much complex
ity to find out that the answer is
so very simple.

This discovery must be hand
led with the utmost tact by the
director, and Mr. Lee Sankowich
fails sadly in that office. He does
not realize that Mousetrap is
more than a circumstantial puz
zle; it is a psychological one as
well. By making his characters
hyperbolic he destroys their
humanity — and so their
psychology. He denies us
thereby several pieces in Christ
ie's puzzle — not to mention cas
trating any dramatic interest.
Part of this failure is due to the
actors themselves, many of
whom (considering their impre
ssive credentials) give amaz
ingly amateurish performances.
Matthew Locricchio, in the
part of Detective Sergeant Trot
ter, lacks the stage presence of a
Christie detective, and appears
as merely a loud-mouthed do
gooder. Even if intentional, this
interpretation was singularly in
effective. I.ocricchio handles the
critical final scenes with an utter
want of finesse and falls into an

unsatisfying stereotype. His ac
cent varies from upper-class
British to American Southern to
cockney apparently at random.
Drew Eshelman, as the odd
young Christopher Wren, is ap
pealingly schizophrenic until
Director Sankowich chooses to
emphasize his homosexuality, at
which point his humanity be
comes bankrupt and his peculiar
neurosis only annoying.
Keeping the production on
track is an eminently believable
Mollie Ralston (the young new
owner of the boarding house) as
played by Susan Brashear.
Mousetrap has never been a
big success outside of London.
After a couple lukewarm recep
tions in New York, the play has
been produced only sporadi
cally i n the United States. This is
therefore a rare opportunity for
the devoted Agatha Christie fan.
As for the rest of us, the $8.50
admission fee should make this
production easy to pass up.

another, and will be a disap
pointment to anyone who wore
out the edge of a seat at the Am
bassador in London.
The plot of the play is classic
Agatha Christie. A young couple
has just opened a snow-bound
boarding house. Just arrived are
five singularly eccentric indi
viduals who may or may not be
involved with a murder just re
ported by the on-stage radio.
Soon a young detective arrives
— on skis no less — and another
murder is accomplished, this
one (almost) before our eyes.
From here on the clues come
fast, and soon all are suspect.
There are, it seems, too many
clues even for Miss Christie to
handle, and to our disappoint
ment, many turn out to be red
herrings. Hence the play's great
weakness. One feels a bit
cheated after so much complex
ity to find out that the answer is
so very simple.

This discovery must be hand
led with the utmost tact by the
director, and Mr. Lee Sankowich
fails sadly in that office. He does
not realize that Mousetrap is
more than a circumstantial puz
zle; it is a psychological one as
well. By making his characters
hyperbolic he destroys their
humanity — and so their
psychology. He denies us
thereby several pieces in Christ
ie's puzzle — not to mention cas
trating any dramatic interest.
Part of this failure is due to the
actors themselves, many of
whom (considering their impre
ssive credentials) give amaz
ingly amateurish performances.
Matthew Locricchio, in the
part of Detective Sergeant Trot
ter, lacks the stage presence of a
Christie detective, and appears
as merely a loud-mouthed do
gooder. Even if intentional, this
interpretation was singularly in
effective. I.ocricchio handles the
critical final scenes with an utter
want of finesse and falls into an

unsatisfying stereotype. His ac
cent varies from upper-class
British to American Southern to
cockney apparently at random.
Drew Eshelman, as the odd
young Christopher Wren, is ap
pealingly schizophrenic until
Director Sankowich chooses to
emphasize his homosexuality, at
which point his humanity be
comes bankrupt and his peculiar
neurosis only annoying.
Keeping the production on
track is an eminently believable
Mollie Ralston (the young new
owner of the boarding house) as
played by Susan Brashear.
Mousetrap has never been a
big success outside of London.
After a couple lukewarm recep
tions in New York, the play has
been produced only sporadi
cally i n the United States. This is
therefore a rare opportunity for
the devoted Agatha Christie fan.
As for the rest of us, the $8.50
admission fee should make this
production easy to pass up.

Agatha Christie's The Mouset
rap has been playing at London's
Ambassador Theatre since 1952,
making it the longest-running
production in British theater his
tory. Less effective than her Wit
ness/or the Prosecution, the play
is nonetheless replete with the
spine-tingling intricacies which
have made Agatha Christie's
reputation as the queen of
murder-mystery. Miss Christie
in this work uses familiar tools
— and her craftsmanship shows
— but producing Mousetrap is
yet a delicate business. If hand
led incorrectly, the characters
can degenerate into cartoon
exaggerations, the suspense into
absurdity, and the denouement
of the mystery into a sudden,
cute and pedestrian wrapping
up.
The production of Mousetrap
currently playing at the Alcazar
Theater falls prey to each of
these "traps" to one extent or
