All About Eve The Bette
Davis film, at least as far as the
academy award judges were
concerned (it took three in the
1950 presentations). The in
terplay between Davis, as a stage
star in eclipse, and Anne Baxter,
as her personal secretary and an
aspiring actress, is so filled with
plausible tension that it is almost
unpleasant: Mankiewicz re
ceived the honors for best direc
tor. Tomorrow evening at 7:30 in
Cubberley. Admission $1 (Stan
ford Film Society).
The Heart is a Lonely Hunt
er A reasonably faithful
transcription of the Carson
McCuller novel. Director Miller

dips occasionally into bathos
and largely fails to generate
McCuller's mood of festering
humanity beneath the thin layer
of Southern gentility, but Alan
Arkin, as the deaf-mute, does a
great deal to redeem the picture.
Tomorrow evening at 7 and 9:15
in Bishop. Admission $1 (Radi
cal Film Series).
Seven Beauties Wertmul
ler's noisy, incoherent moral
statement can be thought of as
the intellectual sequel to the
more successful Swept Away,
made the year before. The emo
tional and political themes of the
earlier film were more overt —
and less self-serious. With Gian
carlo Giannini. Sunday evening
at 7 and 9:30 in Memorial Au
ditorium. Admission $.50 (Sun
day Flicks).
Cesar et Rosalie A curiously
unsatisfying film about love and
the masculine ego. Yves Mon
tand, as the archetypal self-made
man is played off the gently ap
pealing Sami Frey. Romy
Schneider gives an uneven per
formance as the fulcrum from
which the men, and the picture,
try to derive leverage. Quite
wobbly throughout. Wednesday
evening at 7:30 and 9:30 in
Bishop. Admission $1.25
(French Film Series).
