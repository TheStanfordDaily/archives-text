# Kaplan says cancer involves genetics

"Cancer is not a disease but a whole
collection, a category of disease in the
same degree as infection is a categ
ory," said Dr. Henry Kaplan last night.
Kaplan, professor of radiology and
director of the Cancer Biology Re
search Laboratory, gave the first of four
evening lectures on cancer before 300
people at the Medical School's Sher
man Fairchild Auditorium.
According to Kaplan, "cancer in
volves a genetic change in one or more
cells of the body which are capable of
dividing." When the change occurs,
the cells seem to lose both their capac
ity to stop dividing and the "sense of
neighborhood," he said.
"All cells are related to others in the
immediate vicinity and their functions
are strongly determined by their inter
relationships," he said. "Cancer cells
seem to forget where they are and
where they got started, and invade
other tissue."
"This results in the spread of tumor
cells to completely different parts of

the body," said Kaplan.
He cited a variety of agents which
are known to cause cancer in experi
mental animals. Chemical agents are
the "biggest and most diverse group"
of carcinogens, or cancer-causing
compounds, he said.
These include substances such as
hormones and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. These organic com
pounds are found in tobacco tar as well
as food dyes.
Cancer resulting from physical
sources, especially radiation, accounts
for only a tiny fraction of cancers, said
Kaplan, while chemical agents are re
sponsible for 85 to 90 per cent of all
cancers.
"These things are all pervasive," he
said. "They are in every facet of our
environment."
In addition, certain biological
agents, notably viruses, can cause
cancer, said Kaplan.
"It is known today that there are a
rather considerable number, 25 to 30
