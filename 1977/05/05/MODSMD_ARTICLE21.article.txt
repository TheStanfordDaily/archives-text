No Goodbyes
Daryl Hall & John Oates
Atlantic
Daryl Hall and John Oates
began as session cats for the
Stylistics and Chubby Checker.
But then, Jimi Hendrix once
opened a show for the Monkees.
The style of Hall and Oates has
evolved from folk through street
glitter to their present style,
which many call "blue-eyed
soul." Daryl Hall disagreed with
that label in a recent Rolling
Stone article. "Even though our
staff is superficially R&B
(rhythm and blues), we sing
about what white people think
about."
The band tries to appeal not
just to the white audience, but to
females as well. "Onstage 1 guess
I feel in touch with a feminine
sideof myself," Hall told Rolling
Stone. "See we're a band for
girls."
No Goodbyes, their sixth al

bum, is a repackaging of some
old songs, including the hit
single, "She's Clone" from the
Abandoned Luncheonette al
bum. All of the songs but three
are from the previous albums
Abandoned Luncheonette,
War-Bubies, and WhoJe Oats.
This collection adds nothing
new to the repertoire of Hall and
Oates. Their fans would do bet
ter to acquire Abandoned Lun
cheonette and WhoJe Cats, two
good albums.

Festival
Santana
Columbia
Santana, well known for Black
Magic Woman, Oye Como Va,
Evil Ways, has surprises in store
for their followers with the re
lease of Festival. The hard
hitting Latin jazz/rock, group has
successfully experimented with
diverse musical elements, pro
ducing a smorgasbord of sound.
While still easily capable of
the driving percussion, bass and
expertise from Carlos Santana's
wailing lead guitar, Santana
displays its abilities in confi
dently performed numbers rang
ing from the classical guitar ar
rangement in "Verao Vermelho"
to the tight brass ensemble and
keyboards on "Maria
Caracoles."
In addition to the familiar San
tana instrumentation. Festival
features moog synthesizer and
background vocal choruses. Ef
fective production on this album
blended the new and old nicely,
offering a rich variety of expres
sive pieces. Rather than parad
ing the original qualities of the
group, Festival's interpretations
compliment the Abraxas
vintage Santana.
