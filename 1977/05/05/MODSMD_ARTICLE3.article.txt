# U.S. won't exclude Vietnam from U.N.

Paris (AP) — Two years after the fall
of Saigon, the United States agreed
yesterday to drop its opposition to the
entry of Vietnam into the United Na
tions.
America also said it will end its em
bargo on trade with Vietnam as part of
a package deal for establishing dip
lomatic relations "as soon as possi
ble."
An American spokesman said the
United States had decided not to exer
cise its veto of Vietnam's U.N. mem
bership again, regardless of progress
in the talks.
He said the decision was made be
cause the government in Hanoi—
capital of unified Vietnam—
cooperated in the search for American
servicemen missing from the war and
the Carter administration believes in
the universality of the United Nations.
Normalization
A statement on the talks issued by
the Vietnamese delegation made clear,
however, that Hanoi feels the Ameri
can promise to drop the veto also is
part of overall negotiations for estab
lishing normal relations between the
two govern mi • ii *i s.
In addition, the Vietnamese pressed
for American contributions to repair
ing war damage
In Washington, Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey (D-Minn.) and Sen. George
McGovern (D-S.D.) hailed the de

velopment as a first step toward nor
malizing relations between the two
governments. Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) predicted
strong congressional opposition to
postwar aid for Vietnam.
Joint communique
Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister
Phan Hien read what he said was a
joint communique by the two delega
tions on their talks. The communique
said the two sides agreed to seek a
"rapid normalization" of their rela
tions, and added:
"The American representative
stated that the United States would not
oppose the entry of Vietnam into the
United Nations."
State Department spokesman Mor
ton Smith confirmed this was correct
but said the two delegations had not,
in fact, agreed to draft a joint com
munique. Smith said they agreed "in a
general way" what they would make
public about the talks. He added he did
not disagree with any part of the
statement read by Hien.
There was no immediate comment
from the Vietnamese side on the appa
rent discrepancy over the form in
which the outcome of the talks was
reported.
'Cordial, frank'
Smith said the two sides had "cor
dial, frank, useful and constructive
talks" and agreed to meet again in

about two weeks at t he U.S. embassy in
Paris.
The United States used its veto in
the United Nations on three occasions
to bar Vietnam from joining the world
body. During the last debate on the
issue after November's presidential
election, the Ford administration de
manded a full accounting of the esti
mated 2000 Americans missing in ac
tion (MIA) in the Vietnam war.
In March, the Carter administration
sent a presidential commission to
Hanoi for direct negotiations withe the
Vietnamese on the MIAs and made
some progress, including an agree

ment to exchange information on mis
sing servicemen.
The commission, headed by United
Auto Workers President Leonard
Woodcock, returned with the remains
of 11 servicemen killed during the
war. This week's Paris talks were an
nounced after the commission's return
from Hanoi.
Yesterday, Smith said the U.S. dele
gation, headed by Asst. Secretary of
State Richard Holbrooke, had "noted
with appreciation" a Vietnamese
promise to step up the search for
American MIAs.
