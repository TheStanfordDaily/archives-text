S. Korean shot in DMZ ambush
Seoul, South Korea — One or more North
Koreans ambushed a South Korean foot patrol,
killing one man, wounding another and shat
tering nine months of quiet along the de
militarized zone, the United Nations command
said yesterday.
The American-led U.N. command asked the
Military Armistice Commission to investigate
the shooting, but there was no immediate word
whether NORTH Korea would agree.
The command, which includes both Ameri
cans and South Koreans, said one or more
North Koreans had hidden near the southern
fence on the 2V2-mile-wide demilitarized zone
Tuesday and opened fire on the patrol.
North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang re
jected the charges in a broadcast monitored in
Tokyo. The radio said no North Korean sol
diers crossed the demilitarized zone or shot at
South Koreans.
The radio said South Korean authorities and
the U.N. command fabricated the incident to
have an excuse for the continued presence of
U.S. troops in South Korea.
The South Korean fatality was the first re
ported along the demilitarized zone since Aug.
18, when two American officers were killed by
a group of club-and-ax-wielding North Ko
reans at Panmunjom.
Carter to attend British oil summit
Washington — President Jimmy carter
leaves for London today to attend a seven

nation summit conference being held to keep
the economy of the industrialized world func
tioning despite a constant drain of money to
oil-exporting countries.
Nearly every item on the agenda is related in
some way to the high cost of oil.
As spelled out in advance by administration
officials, the agenda includes:
—Improving coordination of the domestic
economic policies of Germany, Japan, Italy, Fr
ance, Great Britain, Ganada and the United
States. The economic performance in all seven
nations has been below par since the 1974-75
recession. There are fears of a new recession,
especially in Europe.
—Establishing emergency financing for
countries in severe financial difficulty because
of high world oil prices. There already has
been a tentative agreement to set up a new fund
totalling as much as $16 billion in the Interna
tional Monetary Fund.
—International trade problems and making a
commitment to move ahead with world trade
negotiations that have been bogged down in
Geneva for nearly two years.
—Reviewing energy problems and reaching
agreement on a global study of nuclear energy
aimed at minimizing the possibility that nuc
lear technology will be used for military pur
poses.
—Working out a common bargaining posi
tion for the industrialized nations in their
negotiations later this year with poor and de
veloping nations.
The economic summit will be held Saturday
and Sunday.
Carter will also make a one-day visit to
California on May 17 for a question-and
answer session with citizens, an address to an
autoworkers convention and a tour of
drought-stricken San Joaquin Valley.
Oil reliance called a security risk
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's
secretaries of state and defense told Congress
yesterday that the United States faces serious
military and diplomatic problems unless it
quickly reduces its reliance on Middle Eastern

oil.
Earlier, Carter told members of Congress at
the White House that his energy package in
cludes 113 legislative proposals and that he
expects Congress to share the heat with him on
the unpopular sections.
The president defended his proposed tax on
gasoline and said the American people want to
make a patriotic effort to help the United States
out of its energy problems.
Testifying before the House Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Energy, Defense Secretary Harold
Brown called the growing shortages of assured
energy resources the most serious threat to the
long-term security of the United States.
Brown said the United States must minimize
its dependence on Persian Cult oil, develop
alternative sources of oil in the western
Hemisphere, develop alternative energy
supplies and secure a billion-barrel petroleum
stockpile as quickly as possible.
Secretary of State Gyrus Vance said the na
tion's energy problems are shared equally with
America's key trading partners around the
world.
"We cannot be in a position where we must
accept a continuing vulnerability to arbitrary
supply disruptions and price changes," Vance
said. "We must resolve to gain control of our
energy destiny."
He said the cornerstone of the Carter plan is
to conserve the scarcest fuels while using those
that are most plentiful under a price structure
that reflects the replacement cost of energy.
Bishops lift penalty for remarriage
Chicago — The nation's Roman Catholic
bishops voted overwhelmingly yesterday to
repeal a century-old church law excom
municating Catholics who have divorced and
remarried.
The bishops voted 231-8 to revoke the ex
communications decree of the Third Council
of Baltimore in 1884, a penalty applied only to
American Catholics.
Revoking it still requires confirmation of
Pope Paul VI, but this was considered almost a

foregone conclusion since the edict involved
only this country.
Estimates put the number of divorced, re
married Catholics in the United States at about
five million.
The head of a canonical affairs committee,
Bishop Cletus O'Donnell of Madison, Wis.,
emphasized that lifting the excommunication
penalty does not in itself make them eligible to
receive Holy Communion since they are consi
dered in invalid marriage unless their first
marriages are annulled.
But he said they no longer would be cut off
from church life as they are under the excom
munication, the church's most severe penalty.
Memo withheld from Congress
Washington — The Carter administration,
citing executive privilege, refused yesterday to
give Congress a Justice Department memo that
reportedly warns of increased vote fraud as a
result of the administration's election-day re

gistration bill.
It was the first time the Carter administration
had invoked the executive privilege doctrine.
The voting bill was among the electoral
proposals submitted to Congress by President
jimmy Carter on March 22. It would permit
persons to register on election day at a polling
place and then vote in presidential and con
gressional elections.
The memorandum prepared by the Justice
Department's criminal division was disclosed
at a hearing yesterday of the Senate Rules
Committee.
