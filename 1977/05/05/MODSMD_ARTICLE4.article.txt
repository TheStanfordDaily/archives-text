## Western culture task force ponders options 
### Randy David 
The western culture task force is try
ing to be as inventive as possible in its
efforts to outline the University's
reinstated western culture require
ment, according to chairman Ron Re
bholz, associated English professor.
Meeting regularly, the committee is
attempting to design the best courses
to satisfy the requirement, which will

apply to students entering after fall
1978.
Objectives of the task force, as out
lined by Rebholz, are to give students
the "common experience of important
and useful documents and texts in
their contexts," to give students the
ability to pursue courses in their own
interests relating to western culture
and to provide "excellent teaching of

all courses involved."
The task force will present a detailed
account of its progress to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies (C-IJS)
June 4, Rebholz said. C-US will present
the final program to the senate at the
end of fall quarter next year, he said.
The task force, formed by the C-US,
has formulated four general patterns
from which it will choose, according
to Rebholz. Rebholz would not dis

close the details of these patterns.
Responsibilities of the task force in
clude designing and selecting courses
to be offered, finding faculty members
to teach the courses, deciding how the
western culture requirement will af
fect distribution requirements and
finding resources to support the
courses.
The task force is currently thinking
in "fairly Utopian terms," Rebholz
said. Later, the task force will examine
cost feasibility of different plans, he
added.
Before going to C-US next month,
the task force will solicit advice from a
special advisory panel of the senate set
up simultaneously with the task force.
The advisory panel is comprised of
faculty members representing most
departments relevant to the western
civilization requirement.
Tech and society
Rebholz said he has met with mem
bers of the engineering Department
and said some aspect of the require
ment will deal with the relationship
between technology and society.
In 1969 a western civilization re
quirement was dropped by the Univer
sity in response to recommendations
by the 1968 Study of Education at
Stanford.
Last December the senate approved
a resolution calling for reinstitution of
an undergraduate requirement in
western culture.
Other members of the task force are
Ernie Gundling, a recent graduate;
Nan keohane, assistant political sci
ence professor; John Perry, associate
philosophy professor; Jon Rider, a
graduate student working with the
program in Structured Liberal Educa
tion; and Paul Seaver, associate history
professor.

clude designing and selecting courses
to be offered, finding faculty members
to teach the courses, deciding how the
western culture requirement will af
fect distribution requirements and
finding resources to support the
courses.
The task force is currently thinking
in "fairly Utopian terms," Rebholz
said. Later, the task force will examine
cost feasibility of different plans, he
added.
Before going to C-US next month,
the task force will solicit advice from a
special advisory panel of the senate set
up simultaneously with the task force.
The advisory panel is comprised of
faculty members representing most
departments relevant to the western
civilization requirement.
Tech and society
Rebholz said he has met with mem
bers of the engineering Department
and said some aspect of the require
ment will deal with the relationship
between technology and society.
In 1969 a western civilization re
quirement was dropped by the Univer
sity in response to recommendations
by the 1968 Study of Education at
Stanford.
Last December the senate approved
a resolution calling for reinstitution of
an undergraduate requirement in
western culture.
Other members of the task force are
Ernie Gundling, a recent graduate;
Nan keohane, assistant political sci
ence professor; John Perry, associate
philosophy professor; Jon Rider, a
graduate student working with the
program in Structured Liberal Educa
tion; and Paul Seaver, associate history
professor.
