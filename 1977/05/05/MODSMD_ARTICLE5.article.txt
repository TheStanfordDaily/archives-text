# Galvez parking revived

After eliminating all parking along
both sides of Galvez Street last year,
the University will soon replace nine
parking spaces.
Last year's changes to Galvez left no
parking spaces in front of the athletic
department. As a result, the postal ser
vice refused for a time to deliver mail
there and the trucks parked in the
middle of the street.
"We were aware of the situation, but
with various departments there were
different concepts of what should be
done to Galvez," said Peter Hopf,
facilities engineer.
When Galvez was rebuilt, the athle
tics department was met halfway. It
was provided with 10-12 minute time
limit parking places on Memorial
Way, he added.
"Evidently those weren't suffi
ciently convenient. So it has come
back to haunt usa little bit," Hopf said.
This project originated with the ath
letic department, when the depart
ment notified facilities planning of the
problems, said John Lerry, manager of
construction and engineering.
To rectify the problems, the board of
trustees approved $31,500 last month
to construct a service driveway, load

ing zone and several short-term park
ing spaces for mail, delivery and
emergency vehicles and ticket pur
chasers.
"It's an inexpensive addition," Hopf
said. The area was "minimally
planted" so that if changes were
necessary they could be made, Hopf
added. No date has been set for the
construction yet, but these projects are
usually done in the summer, Lerry
said.
Last year's improvements to Galvez,
including elimination of all parking,
cost about $235,000, Hopf said.
Lerry said last year's improvement
of Galvez was done because the street
was in such poor condition. "It was 70
feet of asphalt with no landscaping. So
it was rebuilt in advance of the con
struction" being done now in that area,
he said.
At that time, the Committee on Land
and Building Development asked that
Galvez be "deemphasized as a major
thoroughfare through campus."
So Galvez was narrowed to two
lanes, parking was eliminated and the
street was landscaped in hopes it
would become a quiet street again and
not the major access to the center of
campus, Lerry added.

letic department, when the depart
ment notified facilities planning of the
problems, said John Lerry, manager of
construction and engineering.
To rectify the problems, the board of
trustees approved $31,500 last month
to construct a service driveway, load

ing zone and several short-term park
ing spaces for mail, delivery and
emergency vehicles and ticket pur
chasers.
"It's an inexpensive addition," Hopf
said. The area was "minimally
planted" so that if changes were
necessary they could be made, Hopf
added. No date has been set for the
construction yet, but these projects are
usually done in the summer, Lerry
said.
Last year's improvements to Galvez,
including elimination of all parking,
cost about $235,000, Hopf said.
Lerry said last year's improvement
of Galvez was done because the street
was in such poor condition. "It was 70
feet of asphalt with no landscaping. So
it was rebuilt in advance of the con
struction" being done now in that area,
he said.
At that time, the Committee on Land
and Building Development asked that
Galvez be "deemphasized as a major
thoroughfare through campus."
So Galvez was narrowed to two
lanes, parking was eliminated and the
street was landscaped in hopes it
would become a quiet street again and
not the major access to the center of
campus, Lerry added.
