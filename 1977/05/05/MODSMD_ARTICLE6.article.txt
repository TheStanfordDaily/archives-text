# Anita Bryant on homosexuals
## 
### 
Anita Bryant's qualifications
for denouncing homosexuality
as a threat to children and an
abomination to God are based on
unimpeachable expertise and
knowledge. A brief glance at her
background will confirm her
credentials.
Bryant was born in Oklahoma.
She attended Northwestern
University, though she did not
graduate from college. She rep
resented Oklahoma in the 1959
Miss America Pageant, though
she did not win.
She got married.
During the 19605, Bryant was
named to the Oklahoma Hall of
Fame. She toured with Bob
Hope's Christmas shows and
with Billy Graham's evangelical
crusades. She performed at foot
ball bowl games and sang the
"Star Spangled Banner" at the
Republican and Democratic
conventions in 1968.
Orange juice
Moreover, Bryant was a
spokeswoman for Coca Cola and
then for the Florida citrus indus
try. Besides giving birth to four
children, she found time to rep
resent the Friedrich Air Condi
tioning Company and the USO.
She joined the American Orchid
Society.
Bryant has written the best sel
lers, Mine Eyes Have Seen The
Glory, Bless this House and
Bless this Foodâ€”the Anita
Bryant Family Cookbook. In ad
dition, her latest recording is
Anito Bryant's Greatest Sacred
Hits.
Now, in view of these ac
complishments, how can any
one accuse Bryant of lacking the
authority required to vilify
homosexuality?
It might be val id to accuse her
of using her religion as a plat
form from which to pursue the
realization of her own biases.
After all, she is practicing
"selective Christianity," an old
standby of the devout, in which
she invokes Biblical precepts
and prohibitions which agree
with their personal prejudices
and ignores those which do not.
Religious sayings
Bryant is providing a perfect
example of this by insisting on

the Mosaic law against
homosexuality and ignoring the
actual Christian concept of
"Love thy neighbor as thyself,"
not to mention the Golden Rule.
She is also ignoring, as she
makes thousands upon
thousands of dollars from
Crusades, cookbooks and orange
juice jingles, what the Bible has
to say about the rich person's
chances of getting into heaven.

As a former honorary chair
woman of the Freedom Founda
tion of Valley Forge, Bryant
could be expected to realize that
the United States operates on the
concept of a separation of church
and state. But her membership in
the First Foundation for One
Nation Under God may account
for her confusion about this
keystone of democratic freedom.
Menace to children
Bryant says she believes that
the extension of civil rights to
homosexuals will be a grave
menace to children. Homosexu
als, she says, must "recruit"
children since they are biologi
cally unable to reproduce. Be
sides being in error (homosexu
als can reproduce with the oppo
site sex's assistance or through
artificial insemination), Bryant
is overlooking the fact that most
sexual "recruiting" of children
is done by heterosexuals. Almost
all child molesters are
"straights," but since Bryant is
heterosexual, this group doesn't
fall within her prejudice.
One cannot help but wonder
why sheviews homosexuality as
so terrible a threat. Children who
are loved and well cared for gen
erally grow up to emulate their
parents. Does Bryant believe that

all is not right with the American
home, or that homosexuality is
so wonderful that once experi
enced, no one would be able to
resist its delights?
Bryant did not comment on
the "sinfulness" that marked the
19605, when she could conceiv
ably have had more fodder for
her religious cannonades. She
was not nationally exhorting a
return to godliness then. Why
has she suddenly "come out of
the closet," as it were, to prom
ote sexual discrimination?
Probably the answer can be
found in the tone of the times.
This decade of the 1970s is wit
nessing a "return to normality,"
a backlash against the strides for
social justice and
humanitarianism which grew
out of the turmoil of the 19605.
One of the clearest examples
of this is the current revival of
"born again" Christianity, with
its injection of even presidential
fervor. With this revival comes a
rejuvenation of all the prejudices
known to the human race,
sanctified in the name of God.
All too often, religion is a
purely emotional phenomenon,
similar to bigotry. That is why
discrimination and devoutness
are often found fluorishing side
by side. Anita Bryant's cause is
exemplary of this symbiotic rela
tionship.
'Bible' as law
We must repudiate using the
Bible as a source of authority for
civil law. First, separation of
church and state is integral to
this democracy.
Second, the Bible often sanc
tions institutions and behavior
which must not be allowed to
resurface, such as slavery and
polygamy.
Third, the Christian Bible has
absolutely nothing to do with
the millions of non-Christians
who live in the United States.
We must also repudiate those
people who set themselves up as
spokesmen for God and religion.
Since when does representing
the Florida orange juice industry
qualify Anita Bryant to represent
God? And is it too much to ask,
when she expects us to live ac
cording to the teachings of her
religion, to expect her to do the
same?
When Anita Bryant divides
her worldly goods among the
poor, when she stops wearing
painted lips, when she covers
her head from the sight of God,
when she abandons the worldli
ness of recording contracts and
book royalties, maybe then she
will be fit to preach the word of
God to the sinful.
And chickens have lips.
