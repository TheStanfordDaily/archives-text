## South Africa contributions 
### 
When millions of children die
of malnutrition, as in South Af
rica, and when such a tragic
situation can be easily rectified
within the existing economic
capacity of South Africa, then
we of the Stanford Committee on
Hunger call upon each indi
vidual of the Stanford commun
ity to do something about it.
In addition to involvement in
the present controversy over
Stanford investments, we
suggest that direct contributions
to health and development prog
rams can be channeled through
OXFAM (of England) to im
mediately ameliorate the agony

of many.
OXFAM does not work
through the government and
therefore can be more instru
mental in eliminating im
mediate hunger problems.
Money can be sent to the Stan
ford Committee on Hunger and
we will forward it directly to the
OXFAM program.
Also, we encourage citizens to
write their congressmen in sup
port of U.S. policies which will
alleviate suffering in South Af
rica.
It is valuable to simply express
one's concern for the inequity

present under the white minor
ity rule. Repeal of the Byrd
amendment is a case in point of
congressional decision on
foreign policy relating to reduc
ing political oppression in South
Africa.
Furthermore, consider Ameri
ca's role in sending military aid
to South Africa via Israel.
Clearly, our national priorities,
as well as our individual actions,
should be more concerned with
human beings than with guns
and profits.

on behalf of
Stanford Committee on Hunger
