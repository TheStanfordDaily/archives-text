# Palo Alto to elect five for council
## 
### Lonnie Rosenwald News analysis 
Who will hold the key to the future
of land use planning, building code
requirements and pinball machines in
Palo Alto?
Most members of the Stanford com
munity will have a vested interest,
though no vote, when Palo Alto resi
dents go to the polls May 10 to elect
five new members to the city council.
Seventeen candidates are compet
ing for five seats which will become
vacant on July 1. Only one incumbent,
Byron Sher, a law professor here, is
seeking reelection, as four others, in
cumbent:. John Berwald, Kirke Com
stock, John Beahrs and Mayor Sam
Norton, are retiring.
The 17 candidates include four wo
men, the former vice mayor of Palo
Alto, and several Stanford graduates.
The last city council elections held
in Palo Alto in 1975 were an ideologi
cal battle between liberal incumbents
and moderate challengers who at
tacked the council on the issue of a city
contract with the Narcanon Drug Re
habilitation program. The moderates
won and Narconon is gone.
So it seems, is antagonistic politick
ing in Palo Alto. Most campaigning
has been sufficiently sedate to be con
tained within meet-the-candidates
evenings and media publicity.
The major issues in the election are
the development of city-owned land in
the Foothill area and Arastra, and traf
fic congestion. Another point of con
tention among the candidates is
whether or not the Palo Alto Yacht
Harbor ought to be dredged, and how
to produce a plan for the proposed pro
ject.
Another issue concerns energy: how
to secure a sufficient power supply for
the future at a low cost, and whether or
not to discontinue discounts to indus
try.
Most of these issues are rooted in the
underlying contention between the
no-growth and controlled develop
ment forces. However, this election is
different from recent contests in that
no candidate slates have formed.
In addition to Sher, the candidates
are Ellen Fletcher, Alan Henderson,
Gary Fazzino, Harold Justman, Peter
Boland, Frances Brenner, Terry Bur
ton, Bryan Devendorf, Glynn Flacon
Jr., John Fredrich, Charles kubokawa,
Robert Moss, Donald Way, Donald
Spicer, Sarah Parrish, Donald Surath
and John Snow.
