## S. Africa's not that bad 
### 
Don't knock S. Africa
I am getting tired of your
onesidedness when you write
about South Africa. While the
rest of Africa is killing itself off
by the tens of thousands, South
Africa is very quiet. Yet all the
heavy bombardment from you,
the press, is coming down on
them. Slightly unfair, I would
say.
The white African has as
much right to its country as the
black African. I am not some
body that gets his information
from slanted newscasts or pap
ers. I have lived there for 11
years.

Apology
As a member of Stanford
Christian Fellowship, I would
like to extend an apology to any
who were misled by the recent
advertising for the Francis
Schaeffer film series. The adver
tising should have clearly stated
that the films are sponsored by a
Christian organization.
Inter-Varsity, the group which
is sponsoring these films, and

whose name appears on the
posters, is a nationwide organi
zation of Christian college stu
dents and is a member of an in
ternational fellowship involvi ng
about 40 countries. Stanford's
chapter of Inter-Varsity is also
called Stanford Christian Fel
lowship.
We encourage anyone who is
interested in discussing the
ideas presented in the films to
attend an open discussion on
Monday, May 9, after the show
ing of the last two films.
Once again, we apologize for
the mistake.

Albers Wall
The current campaign to pre
vent the placement of Albers
Wall in an appropriately visible
position in front of the physics
tank is indicative of the type of
vapid anti-intellectualism
which sets Stanford apart from
other first rate academic institu
tions.
Students and, even more un
fortunately, faculty here seem to
value passive recreation and re
laxation at the expense of the
aesthetic stimulation which
would be provided by a striking
modern sculpture on the Lomita
Mall.
