# Farmworker health problems reviewed

National Farmworker week is
here and in Washington, D.C.
these first days in May will mark
the beginning of the first Na
tional Farmworker Health Con
ference. It will address and bring
together various groups, races
and philosophies on how to deal
with clinicfunding, health legis
lation, environmental hazards,
like pesticides and many more
important issues.
Here at Stanford it is clear al
ready that at least one course,
designed to introduce Chicano
health care delivery, is oblivious
to the current problems and
trends affecting the health care
problems that plague the occu
pational role of the fieldworker.
Unconcerned
It is apparent that the one
Chicana who dominates the
class planning is about as con
cerned with the pesticide
related illnesses among
farmworkers as is the chemical
industry when it sends its
salesman to advise growers on
which chemicals to use.
The above class, run by Silvia
Corel, planned absolutely no
time for a treatment of the
farmworker environment a 1
health problem and devoted
only one evening to one speaker
discussing rural health.
As 1 witnessed that event
transpire, 1 barely heard one
whisper about the pesticide
problem and this comment basi
cally was dismissing as unsub
stantiated the over-emphasis on
chemical related illness arising
in the fields.
New phase
We are in a new phase of con
fronting environmental prob
lems with increasing attention

paid by the consumers and gov
ernment though many basic sol
utions are yet to be im
plemented.
On September 7-8, 1976, in
Madera, California over 100
fieldworkers were adversely ex
posed to an organophosphrite
causing widespread injury.
This triggered an investiga
tion by the Senate Committee on
Health and Welfare which con
ducted hearings on November
16, and December 3, of that year
to demand explanations
(apologies) for the lack of protec
tion to farmworkers from pes
ticide intoxication.
Today there are three bills
aimed at making progress in im
proving the dismal state of af
fairs existing today that literally
license health care negligence
(see Residue Review).
Yet the gravity of the pesticide
problem with its attendant so
cial, legal, medical and ethical
questions did not seem to im
press the ruling planner of the
above course. She has told me
that the course should em
phasize urban problems and the
need for Chicanos in medical
school positions.
I am forced to conclude that at
least some would-be physicians
who love rhetoric and power are
loathe to admit of medical care
health problems which pose crit
ical questions about the very na
ture of class differences, which
reinforce and perpetuate health
care maldistribution.
No control
I am dismayed at the lack of
control exercised at key levels
which might open up doors to
learning instead of slamming
them shut. When diverse opin

ions, ideas and philosophies are
not encouraged in the long run
everyone suffers through stag
nancy.
When one approaches a prob
lem in a reactionary framework,
this prevents the welding of a
spirit which can truly study
group, personal, ethnic and
geographical differences in

health care needs.
In the wide arena of health to
the extent that diverse rural
health care needs are passed
over, then to that extent the
farmworker health movement is
set back through an already dis
mal future.
