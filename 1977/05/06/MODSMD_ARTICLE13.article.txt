# Bug Me
## 
### Doug Yoshida 
I read the Daily at lunch today (April 29). My
fingers turned black and so, I suspect, did parts of
my sandwich.
What's in the ink? Should I have my stomach
pumped? Should I take out medical insurance to
cover expenses for treatment of cancer of the toes
10 years from now? -??
Steve Hoctor of Nowels Publications (they print
the Daily) said that they use "black standard
newspaper ink which is not harmful in any way."
It contains a lot of carbon and oil, but is perfectly

safe since they (Nowels) have to work with it 10
hours a day.
He added that "newspapers have been using it
for 50 years." Also, markets have been using old
newspaper to wrap fish for many years, so I don't
think you have to worry about your toes falling off!
Something "bugging you?" Just drop a note by
the Daily office or send it to: Bug Me, do The
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, CA 94.105.
