# Local seafood compares with S.F.'s best

San Francisco, renowned
mecca of seafood restaurants,
has a daily supply of the
freshest fish. Dungenness
crab and salmon, when in
season, are extremely choice.
A Hay area specialty is
abalone and when it's prop
erly prepared—and that's
rare —it is superb.
But instead of the long
journey to San Francisco or
even Monterey for a seafood
meal, three restaurants close
to campus offer fresh fish. In
general, their menus state
which dishes are frozen sea
food products (a good rule of
thumb, for example, is that
prawns are always frozen),
and which are not.
IJon't he surprised if what
you want isn't available that
day; availability of al I seafood
is subject to season, weather
and just plain fishing luck.
On the other hand, fish re
commended that day for their
freshness are usually good
bets.
Forgettable potatoes
The Fish Market at 3150 F1
Camino is hoth a restaurant
and seafood market. Kven
thoimh vou should exoect to

pay more for seafood. The
Fish Market is expensive for
what you get because the por
tions are small. Dinners in
clude forgettable Romano
potatoes or rice, a sinal I scoop
of coleslaw or huge ripe
cherry tomatoes. Oddly
enough, no soup or salad is
included.
A great beginning is the
savoury Manhattan-style
clam chowder (with to
matoes) at $.55 a cup. $.95 a
bowl. It may not be the
"world's best," but it is so hot
you have to wait for it to cool
down. Seafood cocktails (crab
$2.25. shrimp $1.95, combi
nation $2.ls)arrive in a small
bowl with seafood sauce and
lemon wedges. Crab and
shrimp louies are available in
half order ($3.25-$3.60).
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleas
ing flavor. Fresh that day,
Troll Chinook Salmon
($6.75) was perfectly cooked,
succulent and outstanding.
East item of the combina
tion ($4.95) —white fish, scal
lops and shrimp skewered
with green pepper and
onion—was iuicv and not

overcooked. Other good bets
are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak
($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with Bentwood
chairs and old fishing photos,
and its youthful, cheery staff
(which is extremely effi
cient).
The Square Bigger, at 3750

Fabian Way, is hard to locate,
but once you do, you will find
many of your seafood favo
rites. Bouillabaise ($7.95) is
the chef's special and con
tains prawns, scallops, clams
and assorted fish. Lobster
from Maine crawl around in a
tank in the kitchen. Prawns,
scallops, crab ($6.95) and beef
($6.50) are available in a dis
tinctive but not overpowering
curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins,

coconut and chutney.
An exceptional dish is
Scallops Saute Belle
Meuniere ($6.50), especially
if you are fortunate enough to
have scallops fresh that day.
Carefully prepared, the scal
lops were saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Non-seafood fans will be
pleased with the large selec
tion of beef dishes and Jade
Chicken ($6.95), served with
grapes.

Nice touches at The Square
Bigger include a salad
crowned with shrimp, a re
lish tray that includes eggroll
and fresh vegetables and
sesame bread instead of the
übiquitous sourdough, flat
ware and the house coffee are
a cut above.
Entrees are served with a
nice rice pilaf and fresh veg
etables. Again, portions
aren't generous.
Tough competition
HI Pescador at 3295 El
Camino offers tough competi
tion to most San Francisco
seafood establishments and
has the most varied menu
with the largest portions in
the area. Poached or broiled
salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella
($7.25) and even Frog Legs
Provencale ($H.25) show the
menu's extensiveness. Non
seafood items include prime
rib ($8.25), broiled half chic
ken ($6.50) and Veal Saltim
bocca ($8.25), which was
written up in Sunset
Magazine.
All entrees come with
soup, often a steaming bowl
of hot fish chowder; an excel
lent rnmaine and sninach

salad with tomato cubes,
croutons and an herbed oil
and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whip
ped butter; ravioli, stuffed
with spinach, in a tomato
meat sauce; and superb ul
denle vegetables. You won't
leave hungry.
Hed Snapper Livornese
($7.95) is highly recom
mended. It has a fragrant gar
lic aroma and a piquant Ita
lian tomato sauce simmered
with black olives, capers and
spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50)
is equally excellent. Two half
lobster tails are stuffed with
creamed crab and mushroom.
Six appetizers include Es
cargots ($2.95) and avocado
dip with clams ($1.95).
Service is very competent.
El Pescador has a rustic, naut
ical environment and a year
round patio. The only disap
pointment here was tin; wine
list, which is very limited and
doesn't match tlie caliber of
the cuisine.
For lunch, El Pescudor has
an extensive offering of
sandwiches, salads and sea
food dishes—all generous
and reasonably priced.
