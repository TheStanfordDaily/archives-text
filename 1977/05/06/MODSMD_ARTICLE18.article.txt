The Names. A Memoir by N. Scott
Momaday, illustrated with photos,
hardbound, $10. Harper and Row, New
Y'ork.
To the reader opening N. Scott Moma
day's new book, the theme must seem a
bit familiar: the attempt to come to a fuller
understanding of oneself by tracing the
family line of one's culturally oppressed
minority back four generations. In these
times such an attempt carries the unfor
tunate stigma of following the inundation
of Roots. Momaday's aims are, however,
somewhat different than those of Arthur
Haley.
The Names is more concerned with
how we come to the act of naming, how
the imagination incorporates the myths,
traditions and history of the past. Moma
day himself describes it as a "memoir," an
autobiography of the imagination. Only
the first chapter deals with family history,
culminating in the naming of Momaday
by the ancient family story-teller. This
baptism scene reverberates with Roots
like images: the old man repeating the
story of their people to a baby, and relat
ing the child to the stars. Momaday's
point is that "an idea of one's ancestry
and posterity is really an idea of the self."
Roots is based on the same principle.
Development
But while Roots ends here, Momaday
has just begun. The next three chapters
follow Momaday's development from
early childhood through the first "loss of
innocence, in retrospection, in the safe
distance of time," to adolescence and
adulthood. His tracing of his own early

memories is, like the tracing of his ances
tors, a search for his self:
If I were to remember other things,
I should be someone else.
Momaday's advantage over most
memoir-writers is his possession of a rich
mythological heritage which feeds his
imagination. His memories seldom fall
into that most common of biographical
quicksands, that of irrelevancy. Even the
very first impressions are legitimized:
Memory begins to tjuulify the imagina
tion, to give it another formation, one that
is peculiar to the self. 1 remember iso
lated, yet fragmented and confused, im
ages -and images, shifting, enlarging, is
the word, rather than moments or events
- which are mine alone and which are
especially vivid to me. They involve me
wholly and immediately, even though
they are the disintegrated impressions of
a young child. They call for a certain at
titude of belief on my part now; that is,
they must mean something, hut their best
reality does not consist in meaning. They
are not stories in that sense, hut they are
storylike, mythic, never evolved but
evolving ever.
Of the useful works with which The
Names shares common ideas, the two
which come to mind most often are
Wordsworth's "Immortality Ode" and
Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man. From Wordsworth come the con
cepts of life as journey from imagination
or sensation to memory '"memory begins

to qualify the imagination"), and the loss
of innocence. From Joyce he takes the
idea that theartist's life is worth examina
tion because it will show a development
of perception, reflected in the develop
ment of style (a large section of the book
consists of "stream-of-consciousness" a
la Molly Bloom).
'Primitive' style
Momaday's usual style could be termed
"American primitive" without any de
rogatory implications. Wherea writer like
Castaneda is taciturn, Momaday is as au
sterely beautiful as the American South
west he describes. In passages closest to
myth his pfose approaches almost Bibli
cal simplicity:
When he went out the moon had only
just appeared. It was huge and thick and
darkly colored at his back, absorbent. He
scarcely knew it was there, but he was
screwed tight upon his thirst, and he
walked again along the highway. He did
not hear the crickets that had begun to
crackle everywhere.
Or this beautiful passage a little further
on:
He could hear everything distinctly
now, the rasping of the crickets and the
frogs, the wind turning, leaves sliding
upon /eaves, a motor in the far distance,
the echo of his laughter dying away, and
beyond that the laughter of God, God's
laughter. It was all so beautiful to hear.
And he opened his eyes wide and looked
all around, and everything shone in his

sight, and it was all so beautiful to see. He
was involved in the light, enchanted. He
said God, spoke the name of God, laugh
ing with his teeth clenched, and he felt
himself whirling in the light.
The temptation is to simply quote en
tire pages, but for that one should buy the
book. Momaday is a master of this style,
and shows himself to be a virtuoso at sev
eral others, most notably the "stream-of
consciousness."
Power and glory
Hut it is the language of myth which is
his power and glory. Applied to the story
of an American heritage which is also a
personal heritage, Momaday's style finds
its "natural" subject. It is finally in nature
that the Kiowa myth is rooted, and from
nature that myths, through names,
emerge (as the Kiowa people are said to
have emerged, "one by one into the world
through a hollow log"):
The names at first are those of animals
and of birds, of objects that have one de
finition in the eye, another in the hand, of
forms and features on the rim of the
world, or of sounds that carry on the
bright wind and in the void. They are old
and originul in the mind, like the beat of
rain on the river, and intrinsic in the na
tive tongue, foiling even as those who
bear them turn once in the memory, go on,
and are gone forever: Pohd-lohk,
Keahdinekeah, Aho.
From ihis opening paragraph grows a
fine book.
