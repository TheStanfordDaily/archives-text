An Eye of Minnows, by Michael Brad
ford Stillman, $4, Indigo Press.
Over the past few years a number of
striking poems have been appearing in
Hay Area magazines under the name of
Michael Stillman (a former resident fel
low in Branner Hall).
These poems stood out from the grey,
mumbling crowd of small magazine
verse, displaying an uncommon personal
authority and technical excitement. And
slowly they attracted a small group of
admirers, a rare accomplishment for
poems published only in journals of such
limited circulation.
Some of the poems were reprinted by
other admiring editors. Still others were
set to music by at least two composers.
Although Stillman had published very
little, he had been taken seriously. His
readers remembered him, and some of
them waited for his first book of poems.
Such a book, they felt, would given them
a chance to see these poems together in a
new perspective.
Debut
But Stillman was not interested in
stopping while his audience caught its
breath. Instead of collecting his indi
vidual published poems for a first collec
tion, he has brought out a challenging
sequence of short peoms for his debut.
This book will probably bother some of
his admirers, delight others, and confuse
the rest, for the volume in question, An
Eye of Minnows, is a difficult book, but
nonetheless an intriguing one.
An Eye of Minnows is a sequence of 275
interrelated haiku. Although at a casual
glance it may look like a thematically ar
ranged collection of discrete poems, the
arrangement as a whole has a deep and
essential unity. While they can be read
separately with pleasure, only when con
sidered as a whole do they gain their full
effect. Read in this way, An Eye of Min
nows becomes both a superb translation
of haiku technique in English, and a dis
turbingly original experiment in au
tobiography.
The haiku in Still man's book are or
ganized under 29 titles which in turn are
assembled in four groups, corresponding
to each of the four seasons. In the Japanese
tradition, haiku usually deal witb some
aspect of seasonal change. Stillman has
borrowed this feature as the organizing
principle of his book. In this, as in other
features he follows the traditional aesthe
tics of Japanese poetry, but in other ways
he makes interesting innovations within
the limits of the form.
Haiku
The haiku, as most people know, is a
Japanese poetic form. Stated simply, it is a
poem of three lines and 17 syllables, with

the lines divided into five, seven, and five
syllables, respectively. But to define
haiku poetry adequately, one needs to
do more than list its metrical features.
Haiku are a uniquely Japanese
phenomena that reflect the entire culture.
To understand the poetics of this literary
form is to understand the philosophy, re
ligion, and values of the country.
For a westerner, haiku area demanding
form to read since they require the reader
to participate in the poet's creative art.
They do not state a situation. They only
imply it, often quite indirectly. The
reader must fill in all the gaps.
In Japan, the more subtly an effective
haiku works, the more highly it is prized.
Readers are willing to live with a poem's
mysteries for years, for indeed its very
unknowableness is considered one of its
chief beauties. A famous Japanese poet
once summed it up: "The haiku, that re
veals three-quarters of its subject is good.
But those that reveal only half of it we
never tire of."
Most commentators are quick to point
out the important correspondences bet
ween haiku and Zen in Japanese culture.
Both reflect the same spiritual concern
and stress the individual's need to
achieve harmony with both himself and
Nature.
Life and nature
Therefore, in order to write a good
haiku, a poet needs more than mere liter
ary skill; he needs a profoundly religious
sympathy with life and nature. He must
be able to see deeply into the world and
then effectively share his vision in a few
words. Poetry is part of a man's life, and
shallowness in one area will betray itself
in another.
This philosophical and artistic integ
rity often seem lacking in English lan
guage haiku. The form is so distressingly
easy to write, it often appears that anyone
capable of counting to 17 can and does
write haiku. It is a favorite form for
amateur poets and publishers, and their
voluminous gushings are ineffably bad.
One can think of very few good contem
porary poets in America who write haiku.
Thus it is not enough to say that
Stillman's haiku are as fine as any I have
ever seen in English; I must also add that
his book contains many haiku that are
superb poems by almost anyone's stan
dards. The reader interested in the pos
sibilities of haiku in English will find An
Eye of Minnows an indispensible book for
its stunning imagery, formal ingenuity,
and intellectual depth. And the general
reader of verse will find it a fascinating
experiment in lyric poetry.
Autobiography
Stillman's book begins with a short
epigraph from Basho, Japan's first great

haiku poet. The epigraph ends, "each day
is a journey, and the journey itself is
home." Clearly Stillman intends Basho's
words as a key to his sequence. The
poems in An Eye of Minnows are intense
moments in an ongoing journey. They re
flect the last 10 years of the poet's life and
borrow their images from his experi
ences.
But the deepest sort of autobiography is
written after an author has made the deci
sive changes in his life. While life is a
journey, some arrivals are more important
than others. Spiritual autobiography not
only reinterprets what has gone on before,
it also points to what the future holds.
Augustine wrote his Confessions after his
conversion to Christianity, and all his de
scendants have wisely followed his
example.
In An Eye of Minnows, one feels this
sort of hard-won enlightenment. While
the poems reveal many terrifying and
painful obsessions, these elements are ul
timately controlled by the newly ordered
context of the poet's life. But the real sub
ject of the poem is reconciliation to pain
and loss:
Visions of silent
deer gliding past wide windows but
nothing is there
Or,
Darkness, keen
echoes of the clock, wind, ruin against
the window, lost, loss
Although this pain is mediated by the
poet's acceptance of his place in the
world, it is also emphasized by the or
ganization of the book. Stillman chose
Winter as the final season in his cycle,
and he ends this section finding little
consolation with the natural order of
things:
The night would be left
no less empty if
the moon were taken away
A vision which had appeared even in
Summer:
We have no place to go
and nothing to do
once we have seen this moon.
But more often the tone is quietly joy
ful, praising existence for its tiny consola
tions, and preserving them in verse :
Wilderness so dark
we could not find our way without
the white flowers
or seeing some promise of his own salva
tion reflected in Nature:
J at the jagged
twigs tip the caterpillar
lifts himself back, safe

But to quote any of these sections in
isolation betrays the essence of the poem.
Each section gains a force and resonance
in context that it is impossible to repro
duce with an excerpt.
Many fail
The reason why so many haiku and im
agistic poems fail in English is the life
less, static quality of their imagery.
Stillman has learned from Ezra Bound
that most successful images are dynamic
in nature. In this way, Stillman presents
images that we usually see as things in
terms of ongoing processes. Thus in the
Spring section of his book he writes:
The willow would
almost seem to be remembering
some other season.
This short poem also demonstrates the
dexterity with which Stillman uses the
haiku form. He always produces fine,
finished poems, not awkward verses with
the necessary number of syllables. In the
poem above, for instance, the first line is
one syllable short since "almost" must be
heard as spanning two lines and "re
membering" is pronounced with only
three syllables as it would be in conversa
tion. He brings the haiku into English as a
living form, not a set of dead conventions.
Acknowledging the technical mastery
and spiritual depth of Stillman's poetry,
as a reviewer I must admit a final reserva
tion. How much can any poet accomplish
in English within the severe limit of the
haiku form? And how successful can an
extended poem be using the intense and
elliptical haiku as its basic unit? While no
one will doubt that individual haiku may
have an occasional success in English,
can the form be used for major vehicles?
A perfect book
In every relevant respect, An Eye of
Minnows is a perfect book. Stillman has
done everything an American poet can do
to translate this elusive poetic form into
English. He has written striking and orig
inal poems, edited and grouped them
judiciously, and even arranged them
carefully o'.i the pages in such a way as to
integrate .heir physical placement in the
book with the thematic concerns. But is
even this enough to affect a radical
change in Western sensibilities of read
ers?
Innovative poetry is often difficult, and
Stillman's poetry is no exception to this
rule. Whether or not the haiku can be
successfully transplanted into a climate
so alien to its original home is a question
each reader will have to answer for him
or herself. But until it is resolved,
Stillman's book will remain a fascinating
exploration of the possibilities of lyric
poetry.
(An Eye of Minnows is now available at
the Stanford Bookstore and Chimaera.)

The haiku in Still man's book are or

Haiku
The haiku, as most people know, is a
Japanese poetic form. Stated simply, it is a
poem of three lines and 17 syllables, with

the lines divided into five, seven, and five
syllables, respectively. But to define
haiku poetry adequately, one needs to
do more than list its metrical features.
Haiku are a uniquely Japanese
phenomena that reflect the entire culture.
To understand the poetics of this literary
form is to understand the philosophy, re
ligion, and values of the country.
For a westerner, haiku area demanding
form to read since they require the reader
to participate in the poet's creative art.
They do not state a situation. They only
imply it, often quite indirectly. The
reader must fill in all the gaps.
In Japan, the more subtly an effective
haiku works, the more highly it is prized.
Readers are willing to live with a poem's
mysteries for years, for indeed its very
unknowableness is considered one of its
chief beauties. A famous Japanese poet
once summed it up: "The haiku, that re
veals three-quarters of its subject is good.
But those that reveal only half of it we
never tire of."
Most commentators are quick to point
out the important correspondences bet
ween haiku and Zen in Japanese culture.
Both reflect the same spiritual concern
and stress the individual's need to
achieve harmony with both himself and
Nature.
Life and nature
Therefore, in order to write a good
haiku, a poet needs more than mere liter
ary skill; he needs a profoundly religious
sympathy with life and nature. He must
be able to see deeply into the world and
then effectively share his vision in a few
words. Poetry is part of a man's life, and
shallowness in one area will betray itself
in another.
This philosophical and artistic integ
rity often seem lacking in English lan
guage haiku. The form is so distressingly
easy to write, it often appears that anyone
capable of counting to 17 can and does
write haiku. It is a favorite form for
amateur poets and publishers, and their
voluminous gushings are ineffably bad.
One can think of very few good contem
porary poets in America who write haiku.
Thus it is not enough to say that
Stillman's haiku are as fine as any I have
ever seen in English; I must also add that
his book contains many haiku that are
superb poems by almost anyone's stan
dards. The reader interested in the pos
sibilities of haiku in English will find An
Eye of Minnows an indispensible book for
its stunning imagery, formal ingenuity,
and intellectual depth. And the general
reader of verse will find it a fascinating
experiment in lyric poetry.
Autobiography
Stillman's book begins with a short
epigraph from Basho, Japan's first great

haiku poet. The epigraph ends, "each day
is a journey, and the journey itself is
home." Clearly Stillman intends Basho's
words as a key to his sequence. The
poems in An Eye of Minnows are intense
moments in an ongoing journey. They re
flect the last 10 years of the poet's life and
borrow their images from his experi
ences.
But the deepest sort of autobiography is
written after an author has made the deci
sive changes in his life. While life is a
journey, some arrivals are more important
than others. Spiritual autobiography not
only reinterprets what has gone on before,
it also points to what the future holds.
Augustine wrote his Confessions after his
conversion to Christianity, and all his de
scendants have wisely followed his
example.
In An Eye of Minnows, one feels this
sort of hard-won enlightenment. While
the poems reveal many terrifying and
painful obsessions, these elements are ul
timately controlled by the newly ordered
context of the poet's life. But the real sub
ject of the poem is reconciliation to pain
and loss:
Visions of silent
deer gliding past wide windows but
nothing is there
Or,
Darkness, keen
echoes of the clock, wind, ruin against
the window, lost, loss
Although this pain is mediated by the
poet's acceptance of his place in the
world, it is also emphasized by the or
ganization of the book. Stillman chose
Winter as the final season in his cycle,
and he ends this section finding little
consolation with the natural order of
things:
The night would be left
no less empty if
the moon were taken away
A vision which had appeared even in
Summer:
We have no place to go
and nothing to do
once we have seen this moon.
But more often the tone is quietly joy
ful, praising existence for its tiny consola
tions, and preserving them in verse :
Wilderness so dark
we could not find our way without
the white flowers
or seeing some promise of his own salva
tion reflected in Nature:
J at the jagged
twigs tip the caterpillar
lifts himself back, safe

But to quote any of these sections in
isolation betrays the essence of the poem.
Each section gains a force and resonance
in context that it is impossible to repro
duce with an excerpt.
Many fail
The reason why so many haiku and im
agistic poems fail in English is the life
less, static quality of their imagery.
Stillman has learned from Ezra Bound
that most successful images are dynamic
in nature. In this way, Stillman presents
images that we usually see as things in
terms of ongoing processes. Thus in the
Spring section of his book he writes:
The willow would
almost seem to be remembering
some other season.
This short poem also demonstrates the
dexterity with which Stillman uses the
haiku form. He always produces fine,
finished poems, not awkward verses with
the necessary number of syllables. In the
poem above, for instance, the first line is
one syllable short since "almost" must be
heard as spanning two lines and "re
membering" is pronounced with only
three syllables as it would be in conversa
tion. He brings the haiku into English as a
living form, not a set of dead conventions.
Acknowledging the technical mastery
and spiritual depth of Stillman's poetry,
as a reviewer I must admit a final reserva
tion. How much can any poet accomplish
in English within the severe limit of the
haiku form? And how successful can an
extended poem be using the intense and
elliptical haiku as its basic unit? While no
one will doubt that individual haiku may
have an occasional success in English,
can the form be used for major vehicles?
A perfect book
In every relevant respect, An Eye of
Minnows is a perfect book. Stillman has
done everything an American poet can do
to translate this elusive poetic form into
English. He has written striking and orig
inal poems, edited and grouped them
judiciously, and even arranged them
carefully o'.i the pages in such a way as to
integrate .heir physical placement in the
book with the thematic concerns. But is
even this enough to affect a radical
change in Western sensibilities of read
ers?
Innovative poetry is often difficult, and
Stillman's poetry is no exception to this
rule. Whether or not the haiku can be
successfully transplanted into a climate
so alien to its original home is a question
each reader will have to answer for him
or herself. But until it is resolved,
Stillman's book will remain a fascinating
exploration of the possibilities of lyric
poetry.

An Eye of Minnows, by Michael Brad

Over the past few years a number of
striking poems have been appearing in
Hay Area magazines under the name of
Michael Stillman (a former resident fel
low in Branner Hall).
These poems stood out from the grey,
mumbling crowd of small magazine
verse, displaying an uncommon personal
authority and technical excitement. And
slowly they attracted a small group of
admirers, a rare accomplishment for
poems published only in journals of such
limited circulation.
Some of the poems were reprinted by
other admiring editors. Still others were
set to music by at least two composers.
Although Stillman had published very
little, he had been taken seriously. His
readers remembered him, and some of
them waited for his first book of poems.
Such a book, they felt, would given them
a chance to see these poems together in a

But Stillman was not interested in

In Japan, the more subtly an effective

Readers are willing to live with a poem's
mysteries for years, for indeed its very
unknowableness is considered one of its

But those that reveal only half of it we
never tire of."
Most commentators are quick to point
out the important correspondences bet
ween haiku and Zen in Japanese culture.
Both reflect the same spiritual concern
and stress the individual's need to
achieve harmony with both himself and
Nature.
Life and nature
Therefore, in order to write a good
haiku, a poet needs more than mere liter
ary skill; he needs a profoundly religious
sympathy with life and nature. He must
be able to see deeply into the world and
then effectively share his vision in a few
words. Poetry is part of a man's life, and
shallowness in one area will betray itself
in another.
This philosophical and artistic integ
rity often seem lacking in English lan
guage haiku. The form is so distressingly
easy to write, it often appears that anyone
capable of counting to 17 can and does
write haiku. It is a favorite form for
amateur poets and publishers, and their
voluminous gushings are ineffably bad.
One can think of very few good contem
porary poets in America who write haiku.
Thus it is not enough to say that
Stillman's haiku are as fine as any I have
ever seen in English; I must also add that
his book contains many haiku that are
superb poems by almost anyone's stan
dards. The reader interested in the pos
sibilities of haiku in English will find An
Eye of Minnows an indispensible book for
its stunning imagery, formal ingenuity,
and intellectual depth. And the general
reader of verse will find it a fascinating
experiment in lyric poetry.
Autobiography
Stillman's book begins with a short
epigraph from Basho, Japan's first great

haiku poet. The epigraph ends, "each day
is a journey, and the journey itself is
home." Clearly Stillman intends Basho's
words as a key to his sequence. The
poems in An Eye of Minnows are intense
moments in an ongoing journey. They re
flect the last 10 years of the poet's life and
borrow their images from his experi
ences.
But the deepest sort of autobiography is
written after an author has made the deci
sive changes in his life. While life is a
journey, some arrivals are more important
than others. Spiritual autobiography not
only reinterprets what has gone on before,
it also points to what the future holds.
Augustine wrote his Confessions after his
conversion to Christianity, and all his de
scendants have wisely followed his
example.
In An Eye of Minnows, one feels this
sort of hard-won enlightenment. While
the poems reveal many terrifying and
painful obsessions, these elements are ul
timately controlled by the newly ordered
context of the poet's life. But the real sub
ject of the poem is reconciliation to pain
and loss:
Visions of silent
deer gliding past wide windows but
nothing is there
Or,
Darkness, keen
echoes of the clock, wind, ruin against
the window, lost, loss
Although this pain is mediated by the
poet's acceptance of his place in the
world, it is also emphasized by the or
ganization of the book. Stillman chose
Winter as the final season in his cycle,
and he ends this section finding little
consolation with the natural order of
things:
The night would be left
no less empty if
the moon were taken away
A vision which had appeared even in
Summer:
We have no place to go
and nothing to do
once we have seen this moon.
But more often the tone is quietly joy
ful, praising existence for its tiny consola
tions, and preserving them in verse :
Wilderness so dark
we could not find our way without
the white flowers
or seeing some promise of his own salva
tion reflected in Nature:
J at the jagged
twigs tip the caterpillar
lifts himself back, safe

But to quote any of these sections in
isolation betrays the essence of the poem.
Each section gains a force and resonance
in context that it is impossible to repro
duce with an excerpt.
Many fail
The reason why so many haiku and im
agistic poems fail in English is the life
less, static quality of their imagery.
Stillman has learned from Ezra Bound
that most successful images are dynamic
in nature. In this way, Stillman presents
images that we usually see as things in
terms of ongoing processes. Thus in the
Spring section of his book he writes:
The willow would
almost seem to be remembering
some other season.
This short poem also demonstrates the
dexterity with which Stillman uses the
haiku form. He always produces fine,
finished poems, not awkward verses with
the necessary number of syllables. In the
poem above, for instance, the first line is
one syllable short since "almost" must be
heard as spanning two lines and "re
membering" is pronounced with only
three syllables as it would be in conversa
tion. He brings the haiku into English as a
living form, not a set of dead conventions.
Acknowledging the technical mastery
and spiritual depth of Stillman's poetry,
as a reviewer I must admit a final reserva
tion. How much can any poet accomplish
in English within the severe limit of the
haiku form? And how successful can an
extended poem be using the intense and
elliptical haiku as its basic unit? While no
one will doubt that individual haiku may
have an occasional success in English,
can the form be used for major vehicles?
A perfect book
In every relevant respect, An Eye of
Minnows is a perfect book. Stillman has
done everything an American poet can do
to translate this elusive poetic form into
English. He has written striking and orig
inal poems, edited and grouped them
judiciously, and even arranged them
carefully o'.i the pages in such a way as to
integrate .heir physical placement in the
book with the thematic concerns. But is
even this enough to affect a radical
change in Western sensibilities of read
ers?
Innovative poetry is often difficult, and
Stillman's poetry is no exception to this
rule. Whether or not the haiku can be
successfully transplanted into a climate
so alien to its original home is a question
each reader will have to answer for him
or herself. But until it is resolved,
Stillman's book will remain a fascinating
exploration of the possibilities of lyric
poetry.

An Eye of Minnows, by Michael Brad
ford Stillman, $4, Indigo Press.
Over the past few years a number of
striking poems have been appearing in
Hay Area magazines under the name of
Michael Stillman (a former resident fel
low in Branner Hall).
These poems stood out from the grey,
mumbling crowd of small magazine
verse, displaying an uncommon personal
authority and technical excitement. And
slowly they attracted a small group of
admirers, a rare accomplishment for
poems published only in journals of such
limited circulation.
Some of the poems were reprinted by
other admiring editors. Still others were
set to music by at least two composers.
Although Stillman had published very
little, he had been taken seriously. His
readers remembered him, and some of
them waited for his first book of poems.
Such a book, they felt, would given them
a chance to see these poems together in a
new perspective.
Debut
But Stillman was not interested in
stopping while his audience caught its
breath. Instead of collecting his indi
vidual published poems for a first collec

sequence of short peoms for his debut.
This book will probably bother some of
his admirers, delight others, and confuse
the rest, for the volume in question, An
Eye of Minnows, is a difficult book, but
nonetheless an intriguing one.
An Eye of Minnows is a sequence of 275
interrelated haiku. Although at a casual
glance it may look like a thematically ar
ranged collection of discrete poems, the
arrangement as a whole has a deep and
essential unity. While they can be read
separately with pleasure, only when con
sidered as a whole do they gain their full
effect. Read in this way, An Eye of Min
nows becomes both a superb translation
of haiku technique in English, and a dis
turbingly original experiment in au
tobiography.
The haiku in Still man's book are or
ganized under 29 titles which in turn are
assembled in four groups, corresponding
to each of the four seasons. In the Japanese
tradition, haiku usually deal witb some
aspect of seasonal change. Stillman has
borrowed this feature as the organizing
principle of his book. In this, as in other
features he follows the traditional aesthe
tics of Japanese poetry, but in other ways
he makes interesting innovations within
the limits of the form.

porary poets in America who write haiku.
Thus it is not enough to say that
Stillman's haiku are as fine as any I have
ever seen in English; I must also add that
his book contains many haiku that are
superb poems by almost anyone's stan
dards. The reader interested in the pos
sibilities of haiku in English will find An
Eye of Minnows an indispensible book for
its stunning imagery, formal ingenuity,
and intellectual depth. And the general
reader of verse will find it a fascinating
experiment in lyric poetry.
Autobiography
Stillman's book begins with a short
epigraph from Basho, Japan's first great

haiku poet. The epigraph ends, "each day
is a journey, and the journey itself is
home." Clearly Stillman intends Basho's
words as a key to his sequence. The
poems in An Eye of Minnows are intense
moments in an ongoing journey. They re
flect the last 10 years of the poet's life and
borrow their images from his experi
ences.
But the deepest sort of autobiography is
written after an author has made the deci
sive changes in his life. While life is a
journey, some arrivals are more important
than others. Spiritual autobiography not
only reinterprets what has gone on before,
it also points to what the future holds.
Augustine wrote his Confessions after his
conversion to Christianity, and all his de
scendants have wisely followed his
example.
In An Eye of Minnows, one feels this
sort of hard-won enlightenment. While
the poems reveal many terrifying and
painful obsessions, these elements are ul
timately controlled by the newly ordered
context of the poet's life. But the real sub
ject of the poem is reconciliation to pain
and loss:
Visions of silent
deer gliding past wide windows but
nothing is there
Or,
Darkness, keen
echoes of the clock, wind, ruin against
the window, lost, loss
Although this pain is mediated by the
poet's acceptance of his place in the
world, it is also emphasized by the or
ganization of the book. Stillman chose
Winter as the final season in his cycle,
and he ends this section finding little
consolation with the natural order of
things:
The night would be left
no less empty if
the moon were taken away
A vision which had appeared even in
Summer:
We have no place to go
and nothing to do
once we have seen this moon.
But more often the tone is quietly joy
ful, praising existence for its tiny consola
tions, and preserving them in verse :
Wilderness so dark
we could not find our way without
the white flowers
or seeing some promise of his own salva
tion reflected in Nature:
J at the jagged
twigs tip the caterpillar
lifts himself back, safe

But to quote any of these sections in
isolation betrays the essence of the poem.
Each section gains a force and resonance
in context that it is impossible to repro
duce with an excerpt.
Many fail
The reason why so many haiku and im
agistic poems fail in English is the life
less, static quality of their imagery.
Stillman has learned from Ezra Bound
that most successful images are dynamic
in nature. In this way, Stillman presents
images that we usually see as things in
terms of ongoing processes. Thus in the
Spring section of his book he writes:
The willow would
almost seem to be remembering
some other season.
This short poem also demonstrates the
dexterity with which Stillman uses the
haiku form. He always produces fine,
finished poems, not awkward verses with
the necessary number of syllables. In the
poem above, for instance, the first line is
one syllable short since "almost" must be
heard as spanning two lines and "re
membering" is pronounced with only
three syllables as it would be in conversa
tion. He brings the haiku into English as a
living form, not a set of dead conventions.
Acknowledging the technical mastery
and spiritual depth of Stillman's poetry,
as a reviewer I must admit a final reserva
tion. How much can any poet accomplish
in English within the severe limit of the
haiku form? And how successful can an
extended poem be using the intense and
elliptical haiku as its basic unit? While no
one will doubt that individual haiku may
have an occasional success in English,
can the form be used for major vehicles?
A perfect book
In every relevant respect, An Eye of
Minnows is a perfect book. Stillman has
done everything an American poet can do
to translate this elusive poetic form into
English. He has written striking and orig
inal poems, edited and grouped them
judiciously, and even arranged them
carefully o'.i the pages in such a way as to
integrate .heir physical placement in the
book with the thematic concerns. But is
even this enough to affect a radical
change in Western sensibilities of read
ers?
Innovative poetry is often difficult, and
Stillman's poetry is no exception to this
rule. Whether or not the haiku can be
successfully transplanted into a climate
so alien to its original home is a question
each reader will have to answer for him
or herself. But until it is resolved,
Stillman's book will remain a fascinating
exploration of the possibilities of lyric
poetry.

An Eye of Minnows, by Michael Brad
ford Stillman, $4, Indigo Press.
Over the past few years a number of
striking poems have been appearing in
Hay Area magazines under the name of
Michael Stillman (a former resident fel
low in Branner Hall).
These poems stood out from the grey,
mumbling crowd of small magazine
verse, displaying an uncommon personal
authority and technical excitement. And
slowly they attracted a small group of
admirers, a rare accomplishment for
poems published only in journals of such
limited circulation.
Some of the poems were reprinted by
other admiring editors. Still others were
set to music by at least two composers.
Although Stillman had published very
little, he had been taken seriously. His
readers remembered him, and some of
them waited for his first book of poems.
Such a book, they felt, would given them
a chance to see these poems together in a
new perspective.
Debut
But Stillman was not interested in
stopping while his audience caught its
breath. Instead of collecting his indi
vidual published poems for a first collec
tion, he has brought out a challenging
sequence of short peoms for his debut.
This book will probably bother some of
his admirers, delight others, and confuse
the rest, for the volume in question, An
Eye of Minnows, is a difficult book, but
nonetheless an intriguing one.
An Eye of Minnows is a sequence of 275
interrelated haiku. Although at a casual
glance it may look like a thematically ar
ranged collection of discrete poems, the
arrangement as a whole has a deep and
essential unity. While they can be read
separately with pleasure, only when con
sidered as a whole do they gain their full
effect. Read in this way, An Eye of Min
nows becomes both a superb translation
of haiku technique in English, and a dis
turbingly original experiment in au
tobiography.
The haiku in Still man's book are or
ganized under 29 titles which in turn are
assembled in four groups, corresponding
to each of the four seasons. In the Japanese
tradition, haiku usually deal witb some
aspect of seasonal change. Stillman has
borrowed this feature as the organizing
principle of his book. In this, as in other
features he follows the traditional aesthe
tics of Japanese poetry, but in other ways
he makes interesting innovations within
the limits of the form.
Haiku
The haiku, as most people know, is a
Japanese poetic form. Stated simply, it is a
poem of three lines and 17 syllables, with

the lines divided into five, seven, and five
syllables, respectively. But to define
haiku poetry adequately, one needs to
do more than list its metrical features.
Haiku are a uniquely Japanese
phenomena that reflect the entire culture.
To understand the poetics of this literary
form is to understand the philosophy, re
ligion, and values of the country.
For a westerner, haiku area demanding
form to read since they require the reader
to participate in the poet's creative art.
They do not state a situation. They only
imply it, often quite indirectly. The
reader must fill in all the gaps.
In Japan, the more subtly an effective
haiku works, the more highly it is prized.
Readers are willing to live with a poem's
mysteries for years, for indeed its very
unknowableness is considered one of its
chief beauties. A famous Japanese poet
once summed it up: "The haiku, that re
veals three-quarters of its subject is good.
But those that reveal only half of it we
never tire of."
Most commentators are quick to point
out the important correspondences bet
ween haiku and Zen in Japanese culture.
Both reflect the same spiritual concern
and stress the individual's need to
achieve harmony with both himself and
Nature.
Life and nature
Therefore, in order to write a good
haiku, a poet needs more than mere liter
ary skill; he needs a profoundly religious
sympathy with life and nature. He must
be able to see deeply into the world and
then effectively share his vision in a few
words. Poetry is part of a man's life, and
shallowness in one area will betray itself
in another.
This philosophical and artistic integ
rity often seem lacking in English lan
guage haiku. The form is so distressingly
easy to write, it often appears that anyone
capable of counting to 17 can and does
write haiku. It is a favorite form for
amateur poets and publishers, and their
voluminous gushings are ineffably bad.
One can think of very few good contem
porary poets in America who write haiku.
Thus it is not enough to say that
Stillman's haiku are as fine as any I have

the poems reveal many terrifying and
painful obsessions, these elements are ul
timately controlled by the newly ordered
context of the poet's life. But the real sub
ject of the poem is reconciliation to pain
and loss:
Visions of silent
deer gliding past wide windows but
nothing is there
Or,
Darkness, keen
echoes of the clock, wind, ruin against
the window, lost, loss
Although this pain is mediated by the
poet's acceptance of his place in the
world, it is also emphasized by the or
ganization of the book. Stillman chose
Winter as the final season in his cycle,
and he ends this section finding little
consolation with the natural order of
things:
The night would be left
no less empty if
the moon were taken away
A vision which had appeared even in
Summer:
We have no place to go
and nothing to do
once we have seen this moon.
But more often the tone is quietly joy
ful, praising existence for its tiny consola
tions, and preserving them in verse :
Wilderness so dark
we could not find our way without
the white flowers
or seeing some promise of his own salva
tion reflected in Nature:
J at the jagged
twigs tip the caterpillar
lifts himself back, safe

But to quote any of these sections in
isolation betrays the essence of the poem.
Each section gains a force and resonance
in context that it is impossible to repro
duce with an excerpt.
Many fail
The reason why so many haiku and im
agistic poems fail in English is the life
less, static quality of their imagery.
Stillman has learned from Ezra Bound
that most successful images are dynamic
in nature. In this way, Stillman presents
images that we usually see as things in
terms of ongoing processes. Thus in the
Spring section of his book he writes:
The willow would
almost seem to be remembering
some other season.
This short poem also demonstrates the
dexterity with which Stillman uses the
haiku form. He always produces fine,
finished poems, not awkward verses with
the necessary number of syllables. In the
poem above, for instance, the first line is
one syllable short since "almost" must be
heard as spanning two lines and "re
membering" is pronounced with only
three syllables as it would be in conversa
tion. He brings the haiku into English as a
living form, not a set of dead conventions.
Acknowledging the technical mastery
and spiritual depth of Stillman's poetry,
as a reviewer I must admit a final reserva
tion. How much can any poet accomplish
in English within the severe limit of the
haiku form? And how successful can an
extended poem be using the intense and
elliptical haiku as its basic unit? While no
one will doubt that individual haiku may
have an occasional success in English,
can the form be used for major vehicles?
A perfect book
In every relevant respect, An Eye of
Minnows is a perfect book. Stillman has
done everything an American poet can do
to translate this elusive poetic form into
English. He has written striking and orig
inal poems, edited and grouped them
judiciously, and even arranged them
carefully o'.i the pages in such a way as to
integrate .heir physical placement in the
book with the thematic concerns. But is
even this enough to affect a radical
change in Western sensibilities of read
ers?
Innovative poetry is often difficult, and
Stillman's poetry is no exception to this
rule. Whether or not the haiku can be
successfully transplanted into a climate
so alien to its original home is a question
each reader will have to answer for him
or herself. But until it is resolved,
Stillman's book will remain a fascinating
exploration of the possibilities of lyric
poetry.

The willow would
almost seem to be remembering
some other season
Thyme cannot live any
longer than other
flowers in the garden
<~o~>
A sudden space
while attempting to climb the ladder -
the broken rung
Lying in the field
by night making new
constellations from old stars
Infinite ocean
in the seashell: a final sound
for Odysseus
Wheeling and soaring
flights of swallows free from all
falsifications
