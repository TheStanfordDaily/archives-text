single concentrated fundraising drive com
pleted by any university.
Gifts and pledges to the campaign, which
began in 1972, totalled $304,050,000, Lyman
announced.
"It is an accomplishment in which a great
many people can take a great deal of pride."
Lyman said. "We are deeply grateful for this
magnificent expression of support for Stan
ford."
More than 54,000 donors made gifts or
pledges in amounts ranging up to an anonym
ous $15 million commitment. More than 5500
volunteers worked on the campaign.
Among central objectives were endowment
support for faculty positions—the campaign
more than doubled it, to a total of over $70
million; funds for student financial aid, for
which the campaign raised more than $35 mill
ion; and the new main library addition, now
under construction, for which the campaign
raised nearly $16 million.
The campaign raised more than $56 million
toward costs of constructing high-priority
buildings on campus, including the Herbert
Hoover Memorial Ruilding, the new law
school complex and the three new Row houses.
National cochairmen were Stanford Chan
cellor ). E. Wallace Sterling and Stanford trus
tee and alumnus Richard E. Cuggenhime, a
San Francisco attorney.
"No university has ever succeeded in
mounting as concentrated a fund drive that has
been as succesful as this one," said David Ful
ton, director of communications for the cam
paign.
"But that doesn't mean that we don't need
money. Fundraising will continuetobe carried
on with as much dedication as it has in the
past," Fulton said.

It's fair time!
