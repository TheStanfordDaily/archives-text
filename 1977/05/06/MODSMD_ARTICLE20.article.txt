## Cordova, Anderson join pros 
### Chris Baker 
Two more Stanford football
players, quarterback Mike Cor
dova and offensive tackle Gary
Anderson were selected in the
final moments of the National
Football League college draft
Wednesday.
Cordova, the Cards' starting
quarterback for most of the 1974
and 1975 seasons, was drafted by
the Philadelphia Eagles in the
11th round.
Anderson, a 6-foot-4, 251-
pound tackle, was taken by De

troit in the 10th round.
With Anderson and Cordova
the number of Stanford players
who were drafted stands at five.
Tony Hill (third round — Dallas
Cowboys), Duncan McColl
(fourth round — Washington
Redskins), and Mike Michel
(fifth round — Miami Dolphins)
were selected Tuesday.
The addition of Hill gives the
Dallas Cowboys five Stanford
players. The others are Scott
Laidlaw, Benny Barnes, Pat
Donovan and Blaine Nye.

Many believe that the Cow
boys came up with the strongest
draft, starting with Heisman
Trophy winner Tony Dorsett.
Besides Dorsett and Hill, the
Cowboys also picked up
Nevada-Las Vegas quarterback
Glenn Carano. Scouts predict
that Carano is a sleeper who may
challenge for the backup spot
behind Roger Staubach.

Don't be surprised when NFL
czar Fete Rozelle announces that
the 1978 Super Bowl will be
played at night. The NFL wants
to pick up better television rat
ings.
