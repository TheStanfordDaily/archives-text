The Stanford Cardinals ripped
the University of Pacific 8-1
Tuesday afternoon in a non
league contest at UOP. Starting
pitcher Jerry Argust went the
distance for the Cards improving
his personal record to four wins
and one loss, while increasing
the team's season record to
41-18.
Stanford commanded a lead
from the start of the game when
they jumped out to a two-run
lead in the top of the first. Pepe
Hinojosa singled to begin the
rout, Larry Reynolds reached
first on a fielder's choice forcing
Hinojosa at second, Tom Guar
dino made it safely to first on an
error and Mike Codiroli then
singled Reynolds home.
Gary Scott then walked, mov
ing Guardino over so that Kevin
Triggs' infield single brought
him home. The Cardinals con
tinued to run the score up
throughout the following eight
innings of play adding two runs
in the third, one in the sixth, one
more in the seventh and finish
ing the game the way they
started — collecting two runs in
the top of the ninth.
Shutout broken
UOP's only run came in the
bottom of the ninth inning with
one man out. An overthrow into
the dugout by shortstop Dave
Perez gave the Tigers a runner on
first. Argust walked the next bat
ter, and yielded a double to
allow UOP to score and break
Argust's shutout.
Argust quickly regained con
trol and stifled the short-lived
rally forcing the next two batters
out on a ground ball and a fly to
leftfield.
The team is prepared for this

weekend's matchup against
UCLA at Sunken Diamond.
"I'd be surprised if all three
games aren't really close,"
commented coach Mark Mar
quess. "We're pretty evenly
matched with UCLA and our
kids have some incentive. We
want to win."
But UCLA is going to be out to
sweep the series because if it
drops even one of the games to
the Cardinals, they assure USC
of the conference championship.
Today's game starts at 2:30
p.m. with Brian Harrison (9-4)
scheduled for mound duties.
Saturday the doubleheader be
gins at noon.
