# Cindermen in West Coast Relays
## Cards prepare for Pac-8 meet 
### 
Seeking to polish performances before next
weekend's Pacific-8 championships in Los
Angeles, the Card track team sends a small but
potent representation to tomorrow's 50th West
Coast Relays in Fresno.
Shot putter Terry Albritton and long jumper
sprinter James Lofton top the list of Stanford
athletes competing in the Raisin City.
Bay Area sportswriters named the pair Northern
California athletes of the week for outstanding per
formances in Saturday's 84-70 Big Meet loss to
California. In addition, Lofton was named Pac-8
athlete of the week, sharing honors with USC's
Clancy Edwards who defeated Olympic silver
medalist Millard Hampton in the 200 in the USC
UCLA dual meet.
Records shattered
Albritton broke the meet and stadium marks
Saturday with a put of 67-9V4. That put, and a later
one of 67-BV2, were the two best outdoor throws in
the world this season.
Lofton took three firsts against the Bears, win
ning the long jump 26-IV4; the 200, 21.0, and the
400, 46.4, a lifetime best. The multi-talented Lof

ton will jump and run legs in the 400-meter and
mile relays tomorrow.
Joining Lofton for the relays will be Marvin
Holmes, Gordon Banks and Alan Sheats in the 400
and Banks, Sheats and Tom Shellworth in the
mile.
Two-mile relay
Stanford also enters a two-mile relay team of
Steve Crowley, Dave Wells, Mark Hadley and Scott
Hickman.
Junior high jumper John Littleboy (seasonal best
of 6-9), freshman javelin thrower Ricky Brown
(213-1) and frosh discus thrower Rick Buss (166-7)
will also compete in Fresno.
Stanford graduate students Mike Boit and Paul
Geis compete tomorrow in the University of Ore
gon's Twilight Meet. Boit, who has the fastest
800-meter time in the world this year (1:46.1),
hopes the fast Hayward track will carry him to a
world's record in the 800. Geis, the 1974 NCAA
three-mile champion, gives a return performance
for Eugene track fans. Geis attended Oregon for
three years.
