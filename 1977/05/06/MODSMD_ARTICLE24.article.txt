# Stanford oarsmen: an independent crew
## 
### Jill Lieber 
In fits of frustration, an athlete
questions why he is putting
himself through physical or
mental agony. Stanford's crew
team rises at 6 a.m. and puts in
almost two hours on the water
six days a week for one simple
reason: they love the sport.
And they love their freedom.
"The fact that our team is en
tirely student run," said coach
Sam Francis, "means that we get
out whatever we put into it.
Everyone rows for himself and
their friends on the team — not
for Stanford. It's more reward
ing."
This is not to say the crew
team doesn't need financial help
from the Athletic Department.
They, like most other club
sports, have given up hassling
the top brass.
Deficit
Men's crew was allotted $1500
by the Club Sports Council for
the 1976-77 season. The wo
men's team was given $800. The
men's crew as of Sept. 1, 1976,
had in an ASSU account $2175
and the women had $748 plus an
additional $120 which was
funds donated from the Athletic
Department improvement plan.
At the beginning of the season
the men collected $1000 in dues
while the women collected
$500.
"It's entirely student run,"
Francis said. "We've got a trea
surer and we talk to alumni
groups for donations every year.
We'll probably be in the red this
season. The total expenses
should come to about $7500.
Overhaul
"The Athletic Department is
hesitant towards any expenses
on crew," Francis said. "They
know if they did it right it would
cost them a bundle. One problem
is that they've never even been to
the boat house."
They'd probably be embarras

sed. Right across the Hay, crew
members at Cal row in luxury.
Their boat house and boats are
top notch. The school recruits
top freshmen and JC oarsmen
each year.
Until recently theCards rowed
in Cal's hand-me-down boats.
This season, for the first time in
nine years, the Cards got two
new eights. The top crew powers
in the country buy new boats
every three years.
Another West Coast school,
Washington, has one of the na
tion's best crew teams. The prog
ram is bigger than Stanford's —
this year the Huskies had 40
freshmen alone out for the
freshman eight boat. At
Washington competitiveness
among oarsmen is intense and
coaches make "cuts" in their ros
ters, limiting the number of
members on the team.
No pressure
"There is no 'we've got to win'
pressure here," Francis said. "A
friend of mine who rowed at
UCLA four years just gave me his
rowing trunks. I asked him if he
wouldn't be needing them any
more and he said, '1 don't care if I
ever see another boat again.'
"That won't happen here be
cause everybody rows for fun.
It's not a chore."
The beauty of crew is best
realized by attending a 6 a.m.
workout.
The sun is just rising over the
calm San Francisco Bay. Ducks
are waddling down the banks to
take a morning dip. The air is
clean and clear.
And there is a stillness ... a
quietness. . .
Then, "Ready, stroke," the
coxswains yell.
Into rowing
"You don't notice the envi
ronment," said oarsmen Mar
shall Payne. "But when every
thing goes right there is an inter
nal uplifting feeling. The boat is

going smoothly and something
hits you — you're there."
Something hit coaches Fran
cis and Tim Odell, both
graduates of Stanford in '74.
Francis, 23, was the captain of
the Stanford crew in '74 and was
the freshman coach last year.
Odell, also 23, is now the coach
of the frosh team.
Both coaches' lifestyles have
been adjusted for crew — Fran
cis works until 12:30 every
morning and gets very little
sleep before rising for morning
workouts. He gets most of his
shuteye in the late morning.
Odell took this year off from
UC-San Diego med school to
coach. After the team practices,
the two train because they plan
to race the lightweight pair on
the Eastern circuit throughout
the summer.
"1 wouldn't want to coach pro
fessionally," Francis said. "1
wouldn't want my job depend
ing on whether I could squeeze
anything out of the oarsmen. 1
rowed for four years and I look at
the job as my giving something
back to the sport which gave me
so much enjoyment.
Need recognition
"It would sure be a lot easier if
there weren't so many hassles
with the Athletic Department.
The biggest problem is not with
money but the fact they ignore
us. We have to make our own
motel arrangements. We drove
down to L.A. and peoplegot lost.
We stayed in parents' homes all
over L.A., so we really couldn't
get together as a team. And one
guy's axle broke on his car and a
whole group was stranded in
Bakersfield.
"I ask myself a lot why I am
doing this and if 1 want to go
through it next year.
"The biggest thrill is winning.
I get more enjoyment out of
watching them win than when 1
won."
