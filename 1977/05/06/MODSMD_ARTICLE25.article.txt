# Now batting ... Mike Bratz
## Cagers abandon Maples for diamond 
### David Georgette 
The ball is the same shape al
though it's a lot smaller and the
rules of the game are quite a bit
different. A look at their roster,
though, and you'd swear these
guys should be on a hardwood
floor rather than on a softball
diamond. After all, for most of
the year, the Sultans of Squalor
work under coach Dick Dißiaso
as the Stanford varsity basketball
team.
"We were talking about it dur
ing the season — getting up an
IM team in softball or vol
leyball," said leftfielder Mark
Fitzner, the sharp-shooting
6- f oot-7 reserve forward.
The Sultans were organized
by basketball manager Jeff Mal
donado.
"This is something the guys
really want to do," he said. "Last
year we wanted to have a team
but we couldn't get all together
on the same day."
The Sultans compete in the
"A" league and are 3-1 on the
season, their only loss coming at
the hands of the Phi Delts two
weeks ago, 2-1. "It's a rough
league; everybody's good," said
Maldonado. "When we have a
full squad, though, we're

tough." The Sultans had only
seven players available against
the Phi Delts because some of the
players had tests.
Prep stars
"A lot of these guys played
baseball in high school," said
Maldonado. All Pacific-8 guard
Mike Bratz was the top hitter on
his Hancock Junior College
baseball team before moving to
the Farm. He teams with
shortstop and Stanford guard
Paul Giovacchini, an All-State
baseball player while in high
school, as the Sultans' keystone
combination. Frontcourt per
former Jeff McHugh, who also
played baseball in high school,
secures the hot corner while
Dick "Stretch" Dohrmann mans
first.
Maldonado, who charac
terizes his main pitch as "basi
cally a knuckle-curve," and
catcher Daryle Morgan form the
battery. The outfield features
Keith Level in right, Doug
Barnes in center and "No Glove"
Fitzner in left.
Fitzner earned his nickname
not because of any defensive de
ficiency but because he patrols
left minus a glove. Although the
IM mushballs are catchable

without a glove, snaring long fly
balls minus a piece of leather is
no easy task. Fitzner, though,
goes without the glove "because
1 played over-the-line in the
summer with a regular softball"
— and without a glove.
Not a misnomer
The Sultans of Squalor was
selected for the team's name be
cause, according to Maldonado,
"It typifies what we're all ab
out." McHugh. though, re
sponded to Maldonado: "It de
scribes you."
With all the natural athletic
ability the Sultans have, one
might think they would over
whelm most of the opposition.
However, according to Mal
donado, in the games there is "a
lot of defense, so it's hard to
overwhelm anybody."
Such was the case last Tues
day, when the Sultans shut out
Harry Hard Stick and the
Softballs, 1-0. The Sultans' sole
run came in the first inning
when Barnes got on board on an
error and came around to score
on a single by Giovacchini that
was misplayed in the outfield.
Air-tight defense by the Sul

tans preserved the victory. Fitz
ner had his barehand technique
working to perfection on all four
flies to left. McHugh scooped up
everything hit at third and Bratz
turned over a key double play to
quash a rally by the Softballs.
Defensive gems
The real game saver, though,
was Dohrmann, who used his
6-8 frame to take away three po
tential base hits on dazzling
fielding plays.
The last out of the game was a
fly to Level, and as he closed his
mitt around the ball, Maldonado
yelled out, "A shut-out!" before
crediting the victory to "brilliant
defense."
But whether the Sultans win a
close one, or end up on the short
end of a long score, "It was the
idea of fun," said Bratz. that ac
counts for the Sultans. The
camaraderie of the basketball
squad, a quality attested to by
both players and coaches, brings
the Sultans together, helped
along a little by a few cans of
Coors and Oly.
"We're out here to win," said
Bratz, "but the main thing is to
have a lot of fun."

tential base hits on dazzling
fielding plays.
The last out of the game was a
fly to Level, and as he closed his
mitt around the ball, Maldonado
yelled out, "A shut-out!" before
crediting the victory to "brilliant
defense."
But whether the Sultans win a
close one, or end up on the short
end of a long score, "It was the
idea of fun," said Bratz. that ac
counts for the Sultans. The
camaraderie of the basketball
squad, a quality attested to by
both players and coaches, brings
the Sultans together, helped
along a little by a few cans of
Coors and Oly.
"We're out here to win," said
Bratz, "but the main thing is to
have a lot of fun."
The ball is the same shape al
though it's a lot smaller and the
rules of the game are quite a bit
different. A look at their roster,
though, and you'd swear these
guys should be on a hardwood
floor rather than on a softball
diamond. After all, for most of
the year, the Sultans of Squalor
work under coach Dick Dißiaso
as the Stanford varsity basketball
team.
"We were talking about it dur
ing the season — getting up an
IM team in softball or vol
leyball," said leftfielder Mark
Fitzner, the sharp-shooting
6- f oot-7 reserve forward.
The Sultans were organized
by basketball manager Jeff Mal
donado.
"This is something the guys
really want to do," he said. "Last
year we wanted to have a team
but we couldn't get all together
on the same day."
The Sultans compete in the
"A" league and are 3-1 on the
season, their only loss coming at
the hands of the Phi Delts two
weeks ago, 2-1. "It's a rough
league; everybody's good," said
Maldonado. "When we have a
full squad, though, we're

tough." The Sultans had only
seven players available against
the Phi Delts because some of the
players had tests.
Prep stars
"A lot of these guys played
baseball in high school," said
Maldonado. All Pacific-8 guard
Mike Bratz was the top hitter on
his Hancock Junior College
baseball team before moving to
the Farm. He teams with
shortstop and Stanford guard
Paul Giovacchini, an All-State
baseball player while in high
school, as the Sultans' keystone
combination. Frontcourt per
former Jeff McHugh, who also
played baseball in high school,
secures the hot corner while
Dick "Stretch" Dohrmann mans
first.
Maldonado, who charac
terizes his main pitch as "basi
cally a knuckle-curve," and
catcher Daryle Morgan form the
battery. The outfield features
Keith Level in right, Doug
Barnes in center and "No Glove"
Fitzner in left.
Fitzner earned his nickname
not because of any defensive de
ficiency but because he patrols
left minus a glove. Although the
IM mushballs are catchable

without a glove, snaring long fly
balls minus a piece of leather is
no easy task. Fitzner, though,
goes without the glove "because
1 played over-the-line in the
summer with a regular softball"
— and without a glove.
Not a misnomer
The Sultans of Squalor was
selected for the team's name be
cause, according to Maldonado,
"It typifies what we're all ab
out." McHugh. though, re
sponded to Maldonado: "It de
scribes you."
With all the natural athletic
ability the Sultans have, one
might think they would over
whelm most of the opposition.
However, according to Mal
donado, in the games there is "a
lot of defense, so it's hard to
overwhelm anybody."
Such was the case last Tues
day, when the Sultans shut out
Harry Hard Stick and the
Softballs, 1-0. The Sultans' sole
run came in the first inning
when Barnes got on board on an
error and came around to score
on a single by Giovacchini that
was misplayed in the outfield.
Air-tight defense by the Sul

tans preserved the victory. Fitz
ner had his barehand technique
working to perfection on all four
flies to left. McHugh scooped up
everything hit at third and Bratz
turned over a key double play to
quash a rally by the Softballs.
Defensive gems
The real game saver, though,
was Dohrmann, who used his
6-8 frame to take away three po
tential base hits on dazzling
fielding plays.
