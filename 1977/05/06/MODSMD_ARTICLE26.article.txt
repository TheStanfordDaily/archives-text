# Keeping track
## Card gridder Gonged? 
### Bruce Anderson 
Tired of the same old song and dance?
Card linebacker Dean Wilson and three of his
hometown buddies from San Diego have taken
care of the problem. The four of them, collec
tively known as the Magicians, appear at noon
today on the Gong Show, NBC's mutated cross
between Ted Mack's Amateur Hour and Rowan
and Martin's Laugh-In.
Wilson, a recent transfer from Grossmont JC,
and the Magicians have been together since
their senior year in high school when they
began performing at talent shows and parties.
In addition to variety show acts, the Magi
cians make movies. Perhaps you remember the
classic The Magicians meet the Sea Monsters.
Look for an autumn release of their upcoming
summer production. The Magicians at the
Alamo.
To earn an appearance on the Gong Show the
Magicians went to Los Angeles where their act
was videotaped. The producer screens the
tapes, then asks promising groups back for a
live audition.
According to Wilson, the Magicians were
"asked back immediately."
If the producer likes the live audition, he
sends the performer or act a written invitation
to come for a live taping.
Early in April Wilson journeyed down to
Burbank to join the rest of the Magicians for a
taping session. After an afternoon rehearsal and
a two-hour wait in a crowded studio room, the
taping began.
All the daytime shows (there is also a weekly
nighttime version of the Gong Show) are taped
on Saturday evenings. Each Saturday five
shows are taped. Wilson and cohorts were the
second act on the fifth show taped.
The first act on our show was a woman sing
'.'6 the 'Sound of Music,' " "She

had a real nice voice and was singing beauti
fully when she changed and sang in a frog's
voice. She kept alternating between the two
voices."
Wilson began the second act by singing
"Pony Boy" on stage by himself. After about 20
seconds the rest of the Magicians dance out on
stage riding pony sticks.
The show is structured such that three celeb
rities, in this case Arte Johnson, Abbe Lane and
J.P. Morgan, grade the acts, or if the act is too
bad they hit a big gong which stops the act
immediately and removes the act from conten
tion for prize money.
Wilson, who is going to Santa Cruz today
because the nearest NBC affiliate which carries
the daytime version of the Gong Show broad
casts out of Salinas-Monterey, will not disclose
whether or not the Magicians were gonged.
He will disclose one piece of information,
however, "We got invited back to be on the
nighttime Gong Show."

The show is structured such that three celeb
rities, in this case Arte Johnson, Abbe Lane and
J.P. Morgan, grade the acts, or if the act is too
bad they hit a big gong which stops the act
immediately and removes the act from conten
tion for prize money.
Wilson, who is going to Santa Cruz today
because the nearest NBC affiliate which carries
the daytime version of the Gong Show broad
casts out of Salinas-Monterey, will not disclose
whether or not the Magicians were gonged.
He will disclose one piece of information,
however, "We got invited back to be on the
nighttime Gong Show."

PLAYBOY PICK. Card signal-caller Guy Ben

Chicago this weekend as a guest of Playboy
magazine which has selected him as the QB for
its annual preseason All-America team.

TOP OF THE WORLD. Cardinals Terry Albrit
ton and James Lofton own the top marks in the
world for this year for their events: Albritton
with a 70-6V2 indoor shot put earlier this year
and Lofton with his 26-9 long jump in Mexico
City. Only four other American collegiate
athletes are current world leaders: Morehouse's
Edwin Moses, intermediate hurdles; USC's
Clancy Edwards, 200; Auburn's Harvey Glance,
100, and UCLA's Mike Tulley, pole vault.
Tired of the same old song and dance?
Card linebacker Dean Wilson and three of his
hometown buddies from San Diego have taken
care of the problem. The four of them, collec
tively known as the Magicians, appear at noon
today on the Gong Show, NBC's mutated cross
between Ted Mack's Amateur Hour and Rowan
and Martin's Laugh-In.
Wilson, a recent transfer from Grossmont JC,
and the Magicians have been together since
their senior year in high school when they
began performing at talent shows and parties.
In addition to variety show acts, the Magi
cians make movies. Perhaps you remember the
classic The Magicians meet the Sea Monsters.
Look for an autumn release of their upcoming
summer production. The Magicians at the
Alamo.
To earn an appearance on the Gong Show the
Magicians went to Los Angeles where their act
was videotaped. The producer screens the
tapes, then asks promising groups back for a
live audition.
According to Wilson, the Magicians were
"asked back immediately."
If the producer likes the live audition, he
sends the performer or act a written invitation
to come for a live taping.
Early in April Wilson journeyed down to
Burbank to join the rest of the Magicians for a
taping session. After an afternoon rehearsal and
a two-hour wait in a crowded studio room, the
taping began.
All the daytime shows (there is also a weekly
nighttime version of the Gong Show) are taped
on Saturday evenings. Each Saturday five
shows are taped. Wilson and cohorts were the
second act on the fifth show taped.
The first act on our show was a woman sing
'.'6 the 'Sound of Music,' " "She

had a real nice voice and was singing beauti
fully when she changed and sang in a frog's
voice. She kept alternating between the two
voices."
Wilson began the second act by singing
"Pony Boy" on stage by himself. After about 20
seconds the rest of the Magicians dance out on
stage riding pony sticks.

rities, in this case Arte Johnson, Abbe Lane and
J.P. Morgan, grade the acts, or if the act is too
