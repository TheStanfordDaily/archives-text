# Running with the best of them
## Geis gets down to business 
### Jeff Parietti 
Paul Geis personifies the term
"student-athlete." Not only is
(ieis a first-year graduate student
in the Stanford Business School,
but he also is a world class dis
tance runner, having finished
12th in the 5000-meter run at the
Montreal Olympic Games.
The 24-year-old Geis boosts
career bests of 3:48 in the mile,
8:21.8 in the two mile, 12:55.8
for three miles and 13:23.4 for
5000 meters.
A 1975 graduate of the Uni
versity of Oregon, that distance
running powerhouse up north,
Geis wasn't always a distance
runner. The Houston, Texas, na
tive used to be an avid tennis
player. In fact, he was one of the
top players in the Lone Star state
during his early teenage years.
Tennis anyone?
"Then when I was 15 everyone
elsegrew; except me," saidGeis.
"I got really frustrated because
people I used to beat, 6-0, 6-1,
were now beating me, 6-0, 6-1. I
didn't start growing until I was
19," said Geis, who now is
5-foot-11, 150 pounds.
Geis gave up competitive ten
nis and turned to track during
his freshman year in high
school, but said that "I didn't
start to run seriously until my
senior year."
During his senior campaign,
he clocked a 4:12 mile and ran
against the nation's top prep
milersat the Golden West Invita
tional meet in Sacramento.
His high school efforts gained
a four-year ride to Rice. There he
won the conference three-mile
title his freshman year.
"But Rice turned out to be too
low key for me," Geis said.
"Everyone thought it was good
that I won the conference title,
but the coaches didn't care if I
went to the NCAAs or AAUs. So I
had to pay my own way to both
meets, which made me a little
mad, and when fall came around
I just told the coach that I wasn't
coming back to Rice."
Prefontaine
Geis found the competitive
atmosphere he wanted at Ore
gon, blossoming into one of the
nation's finest distance men.
"The positive thing about
being at the U.S. Distance Capi
tal (at Eugene) was that there
were a lot of good runners to
train with," said Geis.
One of the "good" runners
Geis trained with was Steve Pre
fontaine, America's top runner

until his untimely death in a car
accident two years ago.
"Pre was a hard worker and
was inspirational to me," said
Geis. "It certainly was a motiva
tional thing with me to train
with him. Sometimes, though, I
got the impression he was up
tight about fostering my de
velopment as a runner because
he was already on top and I was
trying to get there. But I never
knew if my impression was true
or not."
NCAA star
While at Oregon, Geis won an
NCAA three-mile championship
in 1974, a Pacific-8 three-mile
title in 1975 and was runnerup
in the same event in the 1975
NCAAs.
His college success carried
over after graduation as Geis
made the U.S. Olympic team,
finishing third in the trials be
fore the home crowd at Hayward
P'ield in Eugene.
"TheOlympics werea littlebit
of a letdown from what I had en
visioned," Geis said. "In train
ing for t he Olympics you think of

the Games as being just a fantas
tic thing, but there was so much
bureaucracy and hassle.
"There was a lot of security, I
couldn't get my wife, Chris, into
the Olympic village," continued
Geis. "The Canadians didn't re
ally have the stadium ready, they
were still putting the infield
grass in just before the opening
ceremonies."
Political Olympics
And there were political has
sles. "The African boycott only
hurt the athletes," said Geis. "I
saw some of the African athletes
crying after they heard about the
decision."
Geis still managed to concen
trate enough on his event to
make the finals, finishing sec
ond in a 5000-meter heat and
beating two-time double Olym
pic gold medalist Lasse Viren of
Finland in the process.
Geis said he would like to try
and qualify for another Olympic
squad berth, though he added, "I
think the 1980 Games in Mos
cow will be the last Olympic
Games. I think the Russians will

botch it."
But his wife, Ghris, said "I
think they'll (the Russians) do a
great job."
Geis, who entered the busi
ness school last tall, said he
came to Stanford because "it's
got the best biz school in the
U.S."
According to Geis, he's en
joyed Stanford so far. "1 like the
weather especially," he said,
probably thinking about the
sometimes cold, wet running
climate of Oregon.
Like other Stanford athletes,
Geis said he sometimes finds
that "it's really hard to mix
studying and running." He
studies Friday nights to keep up
with the work in his accounting
and finance courses
No coach
As for running, his training
program has been somewhat al
tered by the fact that he does not
have a coach. According to Geis,
there are good and bad points
about this situation.
"The negative side is that
without a coach, there is no one
to take the strain off me so that I
can just go out and do the work
out," Geis explained.
The positive side, according to
Geis, is that his classroom
schedule is so varied that having
a set workout schedule might be
too structured for him.
Why run?
Why does Geis continue to run
even after competing in the
Olympics?
"Running has opened up a lot
of avenues for me," he said. "I've
seen foreign countries and I've
never had to pay for these trips.
"I've been to Europe on three
occasions, I've been to Russia,
South America ... I love to
travel," said Geis.
"Second, I'm a physical fit
ness nut. I feel really good after a
hard workout and I thrive on that
feeling," he said. "It's a form of
masochism: I train really hard,
come home hurting, but men
tally I feel really good.
"Third, it's probably an ego
thing," Geis said. "I enjoy doing
something well. Anybody en
joys doing something that they
can do well."
But Geis is realistic about his
running future. "There's only so
far that track is going to take
me," he said "I have to decide
whether training three more
years for the Olympics is going
to be worth it. I'd have to forego a
lot of income in lieu of training."

nation's finest distance men.
"The positive thing about
being at the U.S. Distance Capi
tal (at Eugene) was that there
were a lot of good runners to
train with," said Geis.
One of the "good" runners
Geis trained with was Steve Pre
fontaine, America's top runner

until his untimely death in a car
accident two years ago.
"Pre was a hard worker and
was inspirational to me," said
Geis. "It certainly was a motiva
tional thing with me to train
with him. Sometimes, though, I
got the impression he was up
tight about fostering my de
velopment as a runner because
he was already on top and I was
trying to get there. But I never
knew if my impression was true
or not."
NCAA star
While at Oregon, Geis won an
NCAA three-mile championship
in 1974, a Pacific-8 three-mile
title in 1975 and was runnerup
in the same event in the 1975
NCAAs.
His college success carried
over after graduation as Geis
made the U.S. Olympic team,
finishing third in the trials be
fore the home crowd at Hayward
P'ield in Eugene.
"TheOlympics werea littlebit
of a letdown from what I had en
visioned," Geis said. "In train
ing for t he Olympics you think of

the Games as being just a fantas
tic thing, but there was so much
bureaucracy and hassle.
"There was a lot of security, I
couldn't get my wife, Chris, into
the Olympic village," continued
Geis. "The Canadians didn't re
ally have the stadium ready, they
were still putting the infield
grass in just before the opening
ceremonies."
Political Olympics
And there were political has
sles. "The African boycott only
hurt the athletes," said Geis. "I
saw some of the African athletes
crying after they heard about the
decision."
Geis still managed to concen
trate enough on his event to
make the finals, finishing sec
ond in a 5000-meter heat and
beating two-time double Olym
pic gold medalist Lasse Viren of
Finland in the process.
Geis said he would like to try
and qualify for another Olympic
squad berth, though he added, "I
think the 1980 Games in Mos
cow will be the last Olympic
Games. I think the Russians will

botch it."
But his wife, Ghris, said "I
think they'll (the Russians) do a
great job."
Geis, who entered the busi
ness school last tall, said he
came to Stanford because "it's
got the best biz school in the
U.S."
According to Geis, he's en
joyed Stanford so far. "1 like the
weather especially," he said,
probably thinking about the
sometimes cold, wet running
climate of Oregon.
Like other Stanford athletes,
Geis said he sometimes finds
that "it's really hard to mix
studying and running." He
studies Friday nights to keep up
with the work in his accounting
and finance courses
No coach
As for running, his training
program has been somewhat al
tered by the fact that he does not
have a coach. According to Geis,
there are good and bad points
about this situation.
"The negative side is that
without a coach, there is no one
to take the strain off me so that I
can just go out and do the work
out," Geis explained.
The positive side, according to
Geis, is that his classroom
schedule is so varied that having
a set workout schedule might be
too structured for him.
Why run?
Why does Geis continue to run
even after competing in the
Olympics?
"Running has opened up a lot
of avenues for me," he said. "I've
seen foreign countries and I've
never had to pay for these trips.
"I've been to Europe on three
occasions, I've been to Russia,
South America ... I love to
travel," said Geis.
"Second, I'm a physical fit
ness nut. I feel really good after a
hard workout and I thrive on that
feeling," he said. "It's a form of
masochism: I train really hard,
come home hurting, but men
tally I feel really good.
"Third, it's probably an ego
thing," Geis said. "I enjoy doing
something well. Anybody en
joys doing something that they
can do well."
But Geis is realistic about his
running future. "There's only so
far that track is going to take
me," he said "I have to decide
whether training three more
years for the Olympics is going
to be worth it. I'd have to forego a
lot of income in lieu of training."

Paul Geis
Paul Geis personifies the term
"student-athlete." Not only is
(ieis a first-year graduate student
in the Stanford Business School,
but he also is a world class dis
tance runner, having finished
12th in the 5000-meter run at the
Montreal Olympic Games.
The 24-year-old Geis boosts
career bests of 3:48 in the mile,
8:21.8 in the two mile, 12:55.8
for three miles and 13:23.4 for
5000 meters.
A 1975 graduate of the Uni
versity of Oregon, that distance
running powerhouse up north,
Geis wasn't always a distance
runner. The Houston, Texas, na
tive used to be an avid tennis
player. In fact, he was one of the
top players in the Lone Star state
during his early teenage years.
Tennis anyone?
"Then when I was 15 everyone
elsegrew; except me," saidGeis.
"I got really frustrated because
people I used to beat, 6-0, 6-1,
were now beating me, 6-0, 6-1. I
didn't start growing until I was
19," said Geis, who now is
5-foot-11, 150 pounds.
Geis gave up competitive ten
nis and turned to track during
his freshman year in high
school, but said that "I didn't
start to run seriously until my
senior year."
During his senior campaign,
he clocked a 4:12 mile and ran
against the nation's top prep
milersat the Golden West Invita
tional meet in Sacramento.
His high school efforts gained
a four-year ride to Rice. There he
won the conference three-mile
title his freshman year.
"But Rice turned out to be too
low key for me," Geis said.
"Everyone thought it was good
that I won the conference title,
but the coaches didn't care if I
went to the NCAAs or AAUs. So I
had to pay my own way to both
meets, which made me a little
mad, and when fall came around
I just told the coach that I wasn't
coming back to Rice."

Games. I think the Russians will

botch it."
But his wife, Ghris, said "I
think they'll (the Russians) do a
great job."
Geis, who entered the busi
ness school last tall, said he
came to Stanford because "it's
got the best biz school in the
U.S."
According to Geis, he's en
joyed Stanford so far. "1 like the
weather especially," he said,
probably thinking about the
sometimes cold, wet running
climate of Oregon.
Like other Stanford athletes,
Geis said he sometimes finds
that "it's really hard to mix
studying and running." He
studies Friday nights to keep up
with the work in his accounting
and finance courses
No coach
As for running, his training
program has been somewhat al
tered by the fact that he does not
have a coach. According to Geis,
there are good and bad points
about this situation.
"The negative side is that
without a coach, there is no one
to take the strain off me so that I
can just go out and do the work
out," Geis explained.
The positive side, according to
Geis, is that his classroom
schedule is so varied that having
a set workout schedule might be
too structured for him.
Why run?
Why does Geis continue to run
even after competing in the
Olympics?
"Running has opened up a lot
of avenues for me," he said. "I've
seen foreign countries and I've
never had to pay for these trips.
"I've been to Europe on three
occasions, I've been to Russia,
South America ... I love to
travel," said Geis.
"Second, I'm a physical fit
ness nut. I feel really good after a
hard workout and I thrive on that
feeling," he said. "It's a form of
masochism: I train really hard,
come home hurting, but men
tally I feel really good.
"Third, it's probably an ego
thing," Geis said. "I enjoy doing
something well. Anybody en
joys doing something that they
can do well."
But Geis is realistic about his
running future. "There's only so
far that track is going to take
me," he said "I have to decide
whether training three more
years for the Olympics is going
to be worth it. I'd have to forego a
lot of income in lieu of training."

Paul Geis
Paul Geis personifies the term
"student-athlete." Not only is
(ieis a first-year graduate student
in the Stanford Business School,
but he also is a world class dis
tance runner, having finished
12th in the 5000-meter run at the
Montreal Olympic Games.
The 24-year-old Geis boosts
career bests of 3:48 in the mile,
8:21.8 in the two mile, 12:55.8
for three miles and 13:23.4 for
5000 meters.
A 1975 graduate of the Uni
versity of Oregon, that distance
running powerhouse up north,
Geis wasn't always a distance
runner. The Houston, Texas, na
tive used to be an avid tennis
player. In fact, he was one of the
top players in the Lone Star state
during his early teenage years.
Tennis anyone?
"Then when I was 15 everyone
elsegrew; except me," saidGeis.
"I got really frustrated because
people I used to beat, 6-0, 6-1,
were now beating me, 6-0, 6-1. I
didn't start growing until I was
19," said Geis, who now is
5-foot-11, 150 pounds.
Geis gave up competitive ten
nis and turned to track during
his freshman year in high
school, but said that "I didn't
start to run seriously until my
senior year."
During his senior campaign,
he clocked a 4:12 mile and ran
against the nation's top prep
milersat the Golden West Invita
tional meet in Sacramento.
His high school efforts gained
a four-year ride to Rice. There he
won the conference three-mile
title his freshman year.
"But Rice turned out to be too
low key for me," Geis said.
"Everyone thought it was good
that I won the conference title,
but the coaches didn't care if I
went to the NCAAs or AAUs. So I
had to pay my own way to both
meets, which made me a little
mad, and when fall came around
I just told the coach that I wasn't
coming back to Rice."
Prefontaine
Geis found the competitive
atmosphere he wanted at Ore
gon, blossoming into one of the
nation's finest distance men.
"The positive thing about
being at the U.S. Distance Capi
tal (at Eugene) was that there
were a lot of good runners to
train with," said Geis.
One of the "good" runners
Geis trained with was Steve Pre
fontaine, America's top runner

until his untimely death in a car
accident two years ago.
"Pre was a hard worker and
was inspirational to me," said
Geis. "It certainly was a motiva
tional thing with me to train
with him. Sometimes, though, I
got the impression he was up
tight about fostering my de
velopment as a runner because
he was already on top and I was
trying to get there. But I never
knew if my impression was true
or not."
NCAA star
While at Oregon, Geis won an
NCAA three-mile championship
in 1974, a Pacific-8 three-mile
title in 1975 and was runnerup
in the same event in the 1975
NCAAs.
His college success carried
over after graduation as Geis
made the U.S. Olympic team,
finishing third in the trials be
fore the home crowd at Hayward
P'ield in Eugene.
"TheOlympics werea littlebit
of a letdown from what I had en
visioned," Geis said. "In train
ing for t he Olympics you think of

the Games as being just a fantas
tic thing, but there was so much
bureaucracy and hassle.
"There was a lot of security, I
couldn't get my wife, Chris, into
the Olympic village," continued
Geis. "The Canadians didn't re
ally have the stadium ready, they
were still putting the infield
grass in just before the opening
ceremonies."
Political Olympics
And there were political has
sles. "The African boycott only
hurt the athletes," said Geis. "I
saw some of the African athletes
crying after they heard about the
decision."
Geis still managed to concen
trate enough on his event to
make the finals, finishing sec
ond in a 5000-meter heat and
beating two-time double Olym
pic gold medalist Lasse Viren of
Finland in the process.
Geis said he would like to try
and qualify for another Olympic
squad berth, though he added, "I
think the 1980 Games in Mos
cow will be the last Olympic
Games. I think the Russians will

botch it."
