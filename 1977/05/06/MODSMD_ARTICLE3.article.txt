The annual Spring Fair, a gala mixture of arts and
crafts booths, entertainers and food specialties, will be
held today through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in
White Plaza.
The fair is sponsored by the Bridge, and it is its chief
fund-raiser for the year. According to Bridge coordinator
Don Gallagher, most of the work setting up and running
the fair will be done by Bridge personnel, while enter
tainers and craftpersons are all volunteers.
Spring Fairs have been a regular event here for the last
several years.
Over 350 craft exhibits were screened to fill the 120
places available.
Wares to be displayed by the various artists include
planters made from barnacles, pregnant stuffed animals,
miniature houses filled with tiny detailed furniture and
a special kind of ink stamp called all-night media, Gal

lagher said.
Entertainment will include the standard line of musi
cians, puppeteers and jugglers, but there will also be a
tightrope walker, a theater group based on the mythol
ogy of Northern California, a face painter and a foot
massager.
Tomorrow afternoon, belly dancers will perform, and
on Sunday there will be flamenco dancers.
For those who prefer to do their own dancing, there
will be folk dancing tomorrow and square dancing Sun
day, he said.
Twenty-five food booths will offer exotic dishes from
countries like Vietnam, Turkey and China. One booth
boasts of having f resh Hawaiian pineapple, another,
three different flavors of beef jerky.
Religious, social and political groups will have a spe
cial area to make presentations and hand out literature.
