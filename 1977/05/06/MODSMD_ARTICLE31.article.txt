Sailing
The Stanford sailing team
sends four men to the PGIYRA
District Doublehanded Champ
ionships at Treasure Island. In
the division A class: Alan An
drews, skipper crewed by Russ
Winslow; division B, Alan Nor
man, skipper crewed by John
Friend.
Twelve teams compete in the
regatta — six teams for northern
California and six teams for
southern California. The scores
from the A and B divisions will
be added together and the top
team will go on to national com
petition at the Coast Guard
Academy in New London,
Conn., June 17-19.
Two weeks ago Stanford won
the Northern Series in both the
double and singlehanded divi
sions. It marked the first time in
the history of five-regatta series
that one school has taken both
titles.
Tennis
Two of Stanford's top
freshmen had big wins at the Cal
State Tennis Tournament in
Pebble Beach this week in the
second and third rounds. Lloyd
Bourne defeated Doug King, 6-3,
2-6, 6-3 in the second round
Wednesday. Bourne was ousted
yesterday in the third round by
Henry Bunis, 4-6, 1-6.

King was the former No. 1
player at Cal.
Jim Hodges defeated Matt
Iwersen in round two, 5-7, 6-3,
6-3. The frosh from Chevy Chase,
Md., then went on to the third
round to beat Mike Machette,
6-7, 7-5, 6-1.
