Committee adds oil amendment
Washington — In a surprise move, the House
Government Operations Committee yesterday
voted to strip U.S. oil companies of their right to
purchase oil and give that authority to the federal
government.
By an 18 to 16 vote, the committee added the
amendment to President Jimmy Carter's legisla
tion for a new Cabinet-level energy department.
Under the proposal, offered by Rep. John Con
yers (D-Mich.), the U.S. government would be
come the "sole importing agent" for oil produced
by the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
The proposed new federal energy department
would then resell the OPEC oil to energy com
panies in the United States.
Conyers said his proposal would break up
what he claimed was a questionable relationship
now enjoyed by huge U.S.-based energy com
panies and OPEC.
Conyers predicted the result would be a reduc
tion in the price of imported oil, which now sells
for about $13.50 a barrel. Conyers blamed huge
U.S. oil companies for being at least partly re
sponsible for the recent increases in the cost of
imported oil.
Under Conyer's proposal, a new public energy
administration would be established within the
proposed energy department.
The oil industry has strongly opposed such
proposals in the past, saying they would be a first
step toward a government takeover of the indus
try.
Carter journeys to Europe
Washington — President Jimmy Carter set out
yesterday on his first venture in international
summitry, a meeting of seven of the world's rich
est nations which are discussing how to stay that
way.
Carter's first trip overseas —to Great Britain—
also includes a meeting between France, Britain,
the United States and West Germany to discuss
such issues as Berlin and the spread of nuclear
power.
The six-day journey will take Carter on to

Geneva, Switzerland, where he will meet with
Syrian President Hafez Assad to talk about Car
ter's efforts to convene a Geneva Conference on
the Middle East.
From Geneva, Carter will return to London for
a meeting of foreign ministers in the North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss arms
sales, standardization of weapons and NATO's
ability to defend Western Europe.
Bishops explore church reform
Chicago — Roman Catholic bishops yesterday
strengthened machinery for including "the voice
of the people" in guiding the church and agreed
that issues surrounding its ban against women
priests need further exploration.
Responding to calls for sweeping changes from
a grass-roots national assembly of laity and
clergy last fall, the bishops gave a mixed re
sponse but they added some extra, favorable
notes to it through revisions from the floor.
The bishops, in their preliminary partial re
sponse, gave a firm "no" to some more controver
sial proposals, such as a softened stand against
contraception and for backing ordination of mar
ried men and women to the priesthood.
The bishops also approved an amendment of
fered by Archbishop William Borders of Balti
more asking for further examination of issues
behind the Vatican's declaration last February
against ordination of women.
The bishops affirmed the Vatican declaration
prohibiting women priests, but declared their in
tent to develop wider ministries for women.
GM recalls 2.2 million 1976 cars
Detroit — The largest recall by general Motors
(GM) in more than four years, involving 2.2 mill
ion cars, was announced yesterday by the world's
largest automaker.
The GM announcement followed disclosures
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad
ministration about alleged defects in cars at GM,
Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen.
The GM probe involves the power brake boos
ter on 2.2 million 1976 Chevrolets, Pontiacs,

Oldsmobiles, Buicks, Cadillacs and GM trucks.
A GM spokesman said the recall would not cost
customers and would involve replacement of a
charcoal fuel filter in the vacuum line between
the engine and the power brake booster.
A GM spokesman said there is "no danger at
present in driving these 1976 models because the
condition requiring corrections occurs only
when temperatures are zero degrees Fahrenheit
or lower."
A GM spokesman said owners of the cars to be
recalled would be notified after GM conducts
further tests and stockpiles the filters to be instal
led.
Ford and Volkswagen have not announced re
calls.
Three reports of accidents prompted the Ford
investigation. Two of the accidents were noncol
lision and the other was a low-speed collision. It
was alleged that the plastic instrument panels on
the vehicles shattered, leaving sharp edges
which could harm passengers.
The recall involves an estimated 192,053 Ford
Econoline and Club Wagons from 1975 to 1977
without instrument panel padding.
Chowchilla testimony challenged
San Francisco — A defendant in the Chow
chilla bus kidnaping case asked the state Sup
reme Court yesterday to set aside his indictment
because it was based in part on testimony by
young children.
Frederick Woods made the request after being
turned down by the state Court of Appeals.
The petition declared there is a question of
whether certain counts in the Madera County
indictment can be sustained when "critical evi
dence to support it" is based on testimony of
children below the age of 14 and where the pro
secution had not previously tried to establish if
they understood the obligation to tell the truth.
A Dairyland Unified School District bus carrying
26 children was hijacked last July 15. The chil
dren and their bus driver were imprisoned in a
buried moving van, but managed to escape.
Woods and two brothers, James and Richard

Schoenfeld, were first charged in Chowchilla
Justice Court in Madera County on kidnaping
and robbery charges connected with that inci
dent.

House approves budget plans
Washington — The House approved a resolu
tion yesterday calling for federal expenditures of
$464.5 billion and a deficit of $66.4 billion in
fiscal 1978.
The 213 to 179 vote came after Democrats
closed ranks and supported a compromise on the
hard-fought issue of defense outlays.
The outcome was a victory for Democratic
leaders, who had warned that the two-year-old
procedure for Congress to write a federal budget
was threatened by initial failure to agree on the
fiscal plan for the year beginning Oct. 1.
When the House Budget Committee sent its
first version of a budget resolution to the floor last
week, it was defeated by a 320-84 vote.
The committee recommended cutting $2.3
billion from President Jimmy Carter's $111.9 bill
ion defense spending proposal. A floor amend
ment restored the amount. This led to a massive
defection of Democratic liberals who contended
military spending was given priority over
domestic social programs.
The committee came back with a compromise
defense figure of $109.9 billion, still $2 billion
under Carter's recommendation. Another
amendment was offered to restore the full
amount, but this time it failed, 233-176.
Today's weather
Variable cloudiness through tomorrow with
showers likely at times. Cooler. Lows in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs mostly in 50s. Chance
of rain 60 per cent today and 30 per cent tonight.

GM recalls 2.2 million 1976 cars
Detroit — The largest recall by general Motors
(GM) in more than four years, involving 2.2 mill
ion cars, was announced yesterday by the world's
largest automaker.
The GM announcement followed disclosures
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad
ministration about alleged defects in cars at GM,
Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen.
The GM probe involves the power brake boos
ter on 2.2 million 1976 Chevrolets, Pontiacs,

Oldsmobiles, Buicks, Cadillacs and GM trucks.
A GM spokesman said the recall would not cost
customers and would involve replacement of a
charcoal fuel filter in the vacuum line between
the engine and the power brake booster.
A GM spokesman said there is "no danger at
present in driving these 1976 models because the
condition requiring corrections occurs only
when temperatures are zero degrees Fahrenheit
or lower."
A GM spokesman said owners of the cars to be
recalled would be notified after GM conducts
further tests and stockpiles the filters to be instal
led.
Ford and Volkswagen have not announced re
calls.
Three reports of accidents prompted the Ford
investigation. Two of the accidents were noncol
lision and the other was a low-speed collision. It
was alleged that the plastic instrument panels on
the vehicles shattered, leaving sharp edges
which could harm passengers.
The recall involves an estimated 192,053 Ford
Econoline and Club Wagons from 1975 to 1977
without instrument panel padding.
Chowchilla testimony challenged
San Francisco — A defendant in the Chow
chilla bus kidnaping case asked the state Sup
reme Court yesterday to set aside his indictment
because it was based in part on testimony by
young children.
Frederick Woods made the request after being
turned down by the state Court of Appeals.
The petition declared there is a question of
whether certain counts in the Madera County
indictment can be sustained when "critical evi
dence to support it" is based on testimony of
children below the age of 14 and where the pro
secution had not previously tried to establish if
they understood the obligation to tell the truth.
A Dairyland Unified School District bus carrying
26 children was hijacked last July 15. The chil
dren and their bus driver were imprisoned in a
buried moving van, but managed to escape.
Woods and two brothers, James and Richard

Schoenfeld, were first charged in Chowchilla
Justice Court in Madera County on kidnaping
and robbery charges connected with that inci
dent.

House approves budget plans
Washington — The House approved a resolu
tion yesterday calling for federal expenditures of
$464.5 billion and a deficit of $66.4 billion in
fiscal 1978.
The 213 to 179 vote came after Democrats
closed ranks and supported a compromise on the
hard-fought issue of defense outlays.
The outcome was a victory for Democratic
leaders, who had warned that the two-year-old
procedure for Congress to write a federal budget
was threatened by initial failure to agree on the
fiscal plan for the year beginning Oct. 1.
When the House Budget Committee sent its
first version of a budget resolution to the floor last
week, it was defeated by a 320-84 vote.
The committee recommended cutting $2.3
billion from President Jimmy Carter's $111.9 bill
ion defense spending proposal. A floor amend
ment restored the amount. This led to a massive
defection of Democratic liberals who contended
military spending was given priority over
domestic social programs.
The committee came back with a compromise
defense figure of $109.9 billion, still $2 billion
under Carter's recommendation. Another
amendment was offered to restore the full
amount, but this time it failed, 233-176.
Today's weather
Variable cloudiness through tomorrow with
showers likely at times. Cooler. Lows in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs mostly in 50s. Chance
of rain 60 per cent today and 30 per cent tonight.
Committee adds oil amendment
Washington — In a surprise move, the House
Government Operations Committee yesterday
voted to strip U.S. oil companies of their right to
purchase oil and give that authority to the federal
government.
By an 18 to 16 vote, the committee added the
amendment to President Jimmy Carter's legisla
tion for a new Cabinet-level energy department.
Under the proposal, offered by Rep. John Con
yers (D-Mich.), the U.S. government would be
come the "sole importing agent" for oil produced
by the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
The proposed new federal energy department
would then resell the OPEC oil to energy com
panies in the United States.
Conyers said his proposal would break up
what he claimed was a questionable relationship
now enjoyed by huge U.S.-based energy com
panies and OPEC.
Conyers predicted the result would be a reduc
tion in the price of imported oil, which now sells
for about $13.50 a barrel. Conyers blamed huge
U.S. oil companies for being at least partly re
sponsible for the recent increases in the cost of
imported oil.
Under Conyer's proposal, a new public energy
administration would be established within the
proposed energy department.
The oil industry has strongly opposed such
proposals in the past, saying they would be a first
step toward a government takeover of the indus
try.
Carter journeys to Europe
Washington — President Jimmy Carter set out
yesterday on his first venture in international
summitry, a meeting of seven of the world's rich
est nations which are discussing how to stay that
way.
Carter's first trip overseas —to Great Britain—
also includes a meeting between France, Britain,
the United States and West Germany to discuss
such issues as Berlin and the spread of nuclear
power.
The six-day journey will take Carter on to

Geneva, Switzerland, where he will meet with
Syrian President Hafez Assad to talk about Car
ter's efforts to convene a Geneva Conference on
the Middle East.
From Geneva, Carter will return to London for
a meeting of foreign ministers in the North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss arms
sales, standardization of weapons and NATO's
ability to defend Western Europe.
Bishops explore church reform
Chicago — Roman Catholic bishops yesterday
strengthened machinery for including "the voice

that issues surrounding its ban against women
priests need further exploration.
Responding to calls for sweeping changes from
a grass-roots national assembly of laity and
clergy last fall, the bishops gave a mixed re
sponse but they added some extra, favorable
notes to it through revisions from the floor.
The bishops, in their preliminary partial re

House approves budget plans
Washington — The House approved a resolu
tion yesterday calling for federal expenditures of
$464.5 billion and a deficit of $66.4 billion in
fiscal 1978.
The 213 to 179 vote came after Democrats
closed ranks and supported a compromise on the
hard-fought issue of defense outlays.
The outcome was a victory for Democratic
leaders, who had warned that the two-year-old
procedure for Congress to write a federal budget
was threatened by initial failure to agree on the
fiscal plan for the year beginning Oct. 1.
When the House Budget Committee sent its
first version of a budget resolution to the floor last
week, it was defeated by a 320-84 vote.
The committee recommended cutting $2.3
billion from President Jimmy Carter's $111.9 bill
ion defense spending proposal. A floor amend
ment restored the amount. This led to a massive
defection of Democratic liberals who contended
military spending was given priority over
domestic social programs.
The committee came back with a compromise
defense figure of $109.9 billion, still $2 billion
under Carter's recommendation. Another
amendment was offered to restore the full
amount, but this time it failed, 233-176.
Today's weather
Variable cloudiness through tomorrow with
showers likely at times. Cooler. Lows in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs mostly in 50s. Chance
of rain 60 per cent today and 30 per cent tonight.
Committee adds oil amendment
Washington — In a surprise move, the House
Government Operations Committee yesterday
voted to strip U.S. oil companies of their right to
purchase oil and give that authority to the federal
government.
By an 18 to 16 vote, the committee added the
amendment to President Jimmy Carter's legisla
tion for a new Cabinet-level energy department.
Under the proposal, offered by Rep. John Con
yers (D-Mich.), the U.S. government would be
come the "sole importing agent" for oil produced
by the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
The proposed new federal energy department
would then resell the OPEC oil to energy com
panies in the United States.
Conyers said his proposal would break up
what he claimed was a questionable relationship
now enjoyed by huge U.S.-based energy com
panies and OPEC.
Conyers predicted the result would be a reduc
tion in the price of imported oil, which now sells
for about $13.50 a barrel. Conyers blamed huge
U.S. oil companies for being at least partly re
sponsible for the recent increases in the cost of
imported oil.
Under Conyer's proposal, a new public energy
administration would be established within the
proposed energy department.
The oil industry has strongly opposed such
proposals in the past, saying they would be a first
step toward a government takeover of the indus
try.
Carter journeys to Europe
Washington — President Jimmy Carter set out
yesterday on his first venture in international
summitry, a meeting of seven of the world's rich
est nations which are discussing how to stay that
way.
Carter's first trip overseas —to Great Britain—
also includes a meeting between France, Britain,
the United States and West Germany to discuss
such issues as Berlin and the spread of nuclear
power.
The six-day journey will take Carter on to

Geneva, Switzerland, where he will meet with
Syrian President Hafez Assad to talk about Car
ter's efforts to convene a Geneva Conference on
the Middle East.
From Geneva, Carter will return to London for
a meeting of foreign ministers in the North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss arms
sales, standardization of weapons and NATO's
ability to defend Western Europe.
Bishops explore church reform
Chicago — Roman Catholic bishops yesterday
strengthened machinery for including "the voice
of the people" in guiding the church and agreed
that issues surrounding its ban against women
priests need further exploration.
Responding to calls for sweeping changes from
a grass-roots national assembly of laity and
clergy last fall, the bishops gave a mixed re
sponse but they added some extra, favorable
notes to it through revisions from the floor.
The bishops, in their preliminary partial re
sponse, gave a firm "no" to some more controver
sial proposals, such as a softened stand against
contraception and for backing ordination of mar
ried men and women to the priesthood.
The bishops also approved an amendment of
fered by Archbishop William Borders of Balti
more asking for further examination of issues
behind the Vatican's declaration last February
against ordination of women.
The bishops affirmed the Vatican declaration
prohibiting women priests, but declared their in
tent to develop wider ministries for women.
GM recalls 2.2 million 1976 cars
Detroit — The largest recall by general Motors
(GM) in more than four years, involving 2.2 mill
ion cars, was announced yesterday by the world's
largest automaker.
The GM announcement followed disclosures
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad
ministration about alleged defects in cars at GM,
Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen.
The GM probe involves the power brake boos
ter on 2.2 million 1976 Chevrolets, Pontiacs,

Oldsmobiles, Buicks, Cadillacs and GM trucks.
A GM spokesman said the recall would not cost
customers and would involve replacement of a
charcoal fuel filter in the vacuum line between
the engine and the power brake booster.
A GM spokesman said there is "no danger at
present in driving these 1976 models because the
condition requiring corrections occurs only
when temperatures are zero degrees Fahrenheit
or lower."
A GM spokesman said owners of the cars to be
recalled would be notified after GM conducts
further tests and stockpiles the filters to be instal
led.
Ford and Volkswagen have not announced re
calls.
Three reports of accidents prompted the Ford
investigation. Two of the accidents were noncol
lision and the other was a low-speed collision. It
was alleged that the plastic instrument panels on
the vehicles shattered, leaving sharp edges
which could harm passengers.
The recall involves an estimated 192,053 Ford
Econoline and Club Wagons from 1975 to 1977
without instrument panel padding.
Chowchilla testimony challenged
San Francisco — A defendant in the Chow
chilla bus kidnaping case asked the state Sup
reme Court yesterday to set aside his indictment
because it was based in part on testimony by
young children.
Frederick Woods made the request after being
turned down by the state Court of Appeals.
The petition declared there is a question of
whether certain counts in the Madera County
indictment can be sustained when "critical evi
dence to support it" is based on testimony of
children below the age of 14 and where the pro
secution had not previously tried to establish if
they understood the obligation to tell the truth.
A Dairyland Unified School District bus carrying
26 children was hijacked last July 15. The chil
dren and their bus driver were imprisoned in a
buried moving van, but managed to escape.
Woods and two brothers, James and Richard

Schoenfeld, were first charged in Chowchilla
