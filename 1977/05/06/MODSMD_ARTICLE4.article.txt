### Jordan Lorence 
The Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
sent a letter yesterday with four de
mands to the Board of Trustees, alum
nus Walt Spevak announced last night
at a forum on South African invest
ment.
The SCRIP letter demanded:
—that Stanford vote its 94,500 Ford
Motor Company shares in favor of a
resolution mandating withdrawal
from South Africa;

—the abolition of the Committee on
Investment Responsibility and the
formation of a new committee;
—that the University prepare a re
port on the possible economic effects
on the University of divestment; and
—that the Board of Trustees meet
with SCRIP before Dead Week.
Tim Smith, executive director of the
Interfaith Center on Corporate Re
sponsibility, said at the forum that
American corporations in South Af
rica are not working for social change
there.
"Companies are there to earn a pro
fit, not to work for social change. No
company will rock the boat and lose its
profits.
"Besides," Smith added, "South
Africa opens the door for foreign in
vestments. You know they wouldn't
let anyone in that would bring
change."
Smith also called on universities to
realize and use the clout they have
over corporations.
"The voice of U.S. universities are
listened to by the corporations. They
must listen. The universities provide
research and technicians for the corpo
rations," Smith said.
Shareholder activism has grown
rapidly in recent years since the Sec
urities Exchange Commission in 1970
began permitting political and social
resolutions to appear on proxies, ac
cording to speaker David Vogel, a
IJC-Berkeley business professor.
He added that student protests
against Dow Chemical in the '60s were
the beginning of shareholder activism.
Smith explained that churches have
influence proxy fights because they
have large pension funds to invest.
"The churches discovered that they
were schizophrenic," Smith said.
"They found they had their social
ethics in one pocket and their stock
portfolios in the other."
Smith added many churches had
studied the South African situation in
tensely, some even sending fact
finding groups there to investigate
practicies of u.S. companies.
Vogel said resolutions are often
withdrawn when companies will
agree to the terms of the resolution.
Earlier this year, General Motors ag
reed not to expand in South Africa and
the resolution was withdrawn.
Peter Necarsulmer, a senior in polit
ical science, and SWOPSI organized
and led the forum.
