# America needs new values, leader of ministries declares
## 
### Jordan Lorence 
America must create new human
and spiritual values to replace
materialistic values, John Perkins said
yesterday at the Kent State-Jackson
State Memorial Lecture in Kresge Au
ditorium.
Perkins heads the Voice of Calvary
Ministries in Jackson, Miss. The an
nual lecture commemorates the killing
of students at Kent State and Jackson
State in May 1970.
Perkins told an audience of 50
people that whites and blacks have not
been effective in changing society be
cause they have been hampered by
guilt and blame.
Whites, he said, are crippled by guilt
of their past deeds, and blacks are not
creative because they only blame the
system which exploits them.
"Therefore, whites must move
beyond guilt, blacks must move
beyond blame and be reconciled," he
said.
Perkins said the present economic
system oppresses many because it is
motivated by profits. He said we have
been conditioned to see our worth not
in terms of peoplebut in terms of mate
rial possessions. We start to change
society, Perkins said, by finding the
bond he sees in Christianity.

"You must be committed to God.
You need a bond that is stronger than
the moment or present issue," he said.
Perkins explained that persons at
universities are trained to sustain the
economic system. The system will
change, he said, when these "techni
cians" move to the poor areas.
"Move to an area of need and make
their needs your needs. Don't give
them charity or welfare. If the system
has fashioned your values, you will
never live among the poor," he said.
Perkins also questioned whether the
present protest against South Africa
will continue or pass away.
"Our system has adjusted itself to
allow students to rebel during their
college years. What will the protesting
students do about South Africa five
years from now?" he asked.
Perkins founded the Voice of Cal
vary Ministries in 1960 in Men
denhall, Miss. The organization has
expanded to Jackson, Miss., and in
cludes a tutoring program, a health
center, a housing redevelopment prog
ram, a cooperative store and various
Christian outreach programs.
Perkins wrote Let Justice Roll Down
and is also a board member ofcßread for
the World.


Be kind to trees
University Plant Services has declared that trees
have the right to live unfettered by bicycle chains. The

move has a practical side —apparently the chains are
not conducive to plant growth.
