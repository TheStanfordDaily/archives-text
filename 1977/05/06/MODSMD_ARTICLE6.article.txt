## Spanish, Portuguese Department changes its curriculum, faculty 
### Gary Furlong 
Massive reorganization efforts are
underway within the Spanish and Por
tuguese Department here, in an effort
to make courses and extra-curricular
activities more practical and more at
tractive to the student, according to
Acting Chairman Fernando Alegria.
The major changes include a large
faculty turnover, a complete overhaul
of the basic language curriculum, and
a broadening of the entire depart
ment's scope, Alegria said.
All this is aimed at relating the
Spanish language and culture to other
disciplines such as political science,
history, economics and art, he
explained.
Several new assistant professors in
the department of 10 have been a much
needed shot-in-the-arm, according to
Alegria.
"It is the presence of these young,
dynamic faculty members that has
helped bring the department back to
life," he said.
Chicano poets
Due to new faculty member
Tomas Ybarra "four of the best chicano
poets in the country are coming to
teach seminars at Stanford," Alegria
said. "It is a very exciting opportun
ity."
"It is fantastic to work with a faculty
that is completely committed to teach
ing," said graduate student Kathleen
Newman. "On top of that, many of the
new members are from Latin America
or the chicano community."
New faculty member Mario Caval
lari, for instance, studied in Argentina
before coming to the United States.
Through people like Cavallari and
Alegria (who is originally from Chile),
big-name political and literary figures
are invited to come here and lecture.
Nicaraguan freedom-fighter Anesto
Cardenal, for example, who is the best
known opponent to the Samosan re
gime there, gave a lecture here this
year.
"The department is coming alive,"

Alegria said.
These activities are being offered as
part of a new area of concentration for
majors — Spanish and Portuguese cul
ture. Previously, literature was the
only area of emphasis for majors.
"The idea is that there is much more
to offer than just literature," Alegria
said. "We want to give students many
areas of interest in Spanish culture."
The reorganization was started by a
group of graduate students last year,
who formed a committee and invited
the faculty to help.
The committee began by conducting
an extensive survey of all under
graduates connected with the depart
ment, to find out exactly what they
wanted, liked or disliked. The result of
this was a change in length of the basic
language series, from three years to
two.
"We found that students in the de
partment wanted to get through the
language and get to the major," Aleg
ria said. "Students who were not
majors didn't have three years to spend
studying the language."
Consequently, a two-year series of
somewhat more intensive language
will be instituted next year, he said.
"The department is now becoming
what it always should have been,"
Alegria said.
To help achieve a community spirit
on campus, the department has started
the paperwork to establish a Spanish
theme house. This would be separate
from Casa Zapata, which is thechicano
theme house,
This would become the center of
Spanish culture for students. Mean
while, Mariposa House, behind the
Law School, where the department is
temporarily located, serves that func
tion.
"The department has become iden
tified with Mariposa," Newman said.
"We'd like to stay here."

Through people like Cavallari and
Alegria (who is originally from Chile),
big-name political and literary figures
are invited to come here and lecture.
Nicaraguan freedom-fighter Anesto
Cardenal, for example, who is the best
known opponent to the Samosan re
gime there, gave a lecture here this
year.
"The department is coming alive,"

Alegria said.
These activities are being offered as
part of a new area of concentration for
majors — Spanish and Portuguese cul
ture. Previously, literature was the
only area of emphasis for majors.
"The idea is that there is much more
to offer than just literature," Alegria
said. "We want to give students many
areas of interest in Spanish culture."
The reorganization was started by a
group of graduate students last year,
who formed a committee and invited
the faculty to help.
The committee began by conducting
an extensive survey of all under
graduates connected with the depart
ment, to find out exactly what they
wanted, liked or disliked. The result of
this was a change in length of the basic
language series, from three years to
two.
"We found that students in the de
partment wanted to get through the
language and get to the major," Aleg
ria said. "Students who were not
majors didn't have three years to spend
studying the language."
Consequently, a two-year series of
somewhat more intensive language
will be instituted next year, he said.
"The department is now becoming
what it always should have been,"
Alegria said.
To help achieve a community spirit
on campus, the department has started
the paperwork to establish a Spanish
theme house. This would be separate
from Casa Zapata, which is thechicano
theme house,
This would become the center of
Spanish culture for students. Mean
while, Mariposa House, behind the
Law School, where the department is
temporarily located, serves that func
tion.
"The department has become iden
tified with Mariposa," Newman said.
"We'd like to stay here."
Massive reorganization efforts are
underway within the Spanish and Por
tuguese Department here, in an effort
to make courses and extra-curricular
activities more practical and more at
tractive to the student, according to
Acting Chairman Fernando Alegria.
The major changes include a large
faculty turnover, a complete overhaul
of the basic language curriculum, and
a broadening of the entire depart
ment's scope, Alegria said.
All this is aimed at relating the
Spanish language and culture to other
disciplines such as political science,
history, economics and art, he
explained.
Several new assistant professors in
the department of 10 have been a much
needed shot-in-the-arm, according to
Alegria.
"It is the presence of these young,
dynamic faculty members that has
helped bring the department back to
life," he said.
Chicano poets
Due to new faculty member
Tomas Ybarra "four of the best chicano
poets in the country are coming to
teach seminars at Stanford," Alegria
said. "It is a very exciting opportun
ity."
"It is fantastic to work with a faculty
that is completely committed to teach
ing," said graduate student Kathleen
Newman. "On top of that, many of the
new members are from Latin America
or the chicano community."
New faculty member Mario Caval
lari, for instance, studied in Argentina
before coming to the United States.
