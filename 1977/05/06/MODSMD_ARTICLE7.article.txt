# Lagunita leads energy saving

Energy savings in Lagunita Court
during the past two months are
enough to "light a house for 25 years,"
according to Karl Johnson, energy
manager office consultant.
Lagunita has been the pilot project
residence of a program Johnson began
in February to reduce energy use here.
By a voluntary effort at "waste avoi
dance," Lagunita cut back its kilowatt
hours of energy by 38 per cent in
March, compared to March 1976 and
35 per cent in April, compared to April
1976, he said.
Waste avoidance means eliminating
unnecessary lighting in public places.
Examples offered by Johnson were
turning off bathroom lights if no one
was using the bathroom, turning off
the lights in residence lounges at
night, or reducing the lighting in
hallways.
"Almost 200 homes could be lit each
day by the energy now being saved
each day in Lagunita Court," Johnson
said.
In the month from March 21 to April
20, energy used in University resi
dences dropped by about 92,000
kilowatt hours from last year's usage,
he said.
Using the average utility rate of
three cents per kilowatt hour, the Uni
versity saved about $2760. Johnson at
tributed 'a lot of these savings to
energy saving efforts in the resi
dences."
People in Lagunita replaced 150
100-watt lightbulbs with 60-watt
bulbs, which saves almost one
kilowatt hour of electricity per bulb
over a 24-hour period.
Using only three of the eight chan
deliers in Toyon Hall made a signific
ant difference in reducing kilowatt
hours use by 17 per cent in March,
Johnson said.
Savings statistics in Lagunita have
been compiled by residents taking
daily readings from the kilowatt met
ers in the residence.
People in Florence Moore have also
been taking readings, Johnson said,
and recorded a 31 per cent drop in
March and a 35 per cent drop in April
from last year's usage.
Using the three cent rate, Johnson
estimated Lagunita had saved $819 in
electricity bills and Florence Moore
had saved $1180.
