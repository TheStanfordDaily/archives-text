## Opinions TV's one big ad game 
### 
Abby Roeder

If you have read any one of a
number of news magazines, big
daily newspapers or specialized
broadcasting journals recently,
you are awar6 that William
Paley, the chief executive of
CBS, is stepping down from his
post of several decades.
In all likelihood, his job will
be filled by John Backe, a finan
cial and marketing expert and
president of (IBS for the past six
years. Though such changes do
not occur every day, this infor

mation is not particularly
momentous.
What is important is that the
man chosen to head one of the
three major networks in the Un
ited States has a background
such as that of Backe. The fact
that Backe's field of expertise is
marketing says a lot about the
status of television in America.
Ads, sellout
Television is an advertising
medium. You are sought as a
gullible public rather than as
consumers who are interested in
being entertained tastefully.
The networks' role is to choose
programming which will
maximize the audience, attract
ing advertisers who are willing
to pay high fees for advertising
time.
As a consequence of this goal
of audience maximization, both
diversity and quality in prog
ramming suffer. ,
No fault
The networks cannot be
faulted for making such prog
ramming sacrifices to maximize
their profits. That is the basis of
the American economic system.
The inadequacies in broadcast
ing can be blamed on the whole
design of the broadcasting sys
tem in America.
The Federal Communications
Act of 1934 sets up the Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC) permitting it to grant
licenses and license renewals on
the basis of "the public interest,
convenience and necessity."

Such wording is excessively
broad in a nation in which the
press is protected from the ex
cesses of government by the First
Amendment. Such protection is
deserved by broadcasting as wel 1
as by the print media. A common
argument against this limitation

of the government's power over
the broadcasting industry is that
access to broadcasting media is
limited and those who are not
privileged to have such access
need protection.
Yet if you look carefully at the
broadcasting system, it is gov
ernment regulation itself which
limits access to the media. The
FCC has the power to control the
use of broadcast spectra.
The pretense for this control is
that overlapping signals would
make it impossible for viewers to
watch television because of
cross channel interference. But
such powers given to a govern
ment agency demonstrate a lack
of faith in the free market to con
trol itself.
Open access
Were there an open access sys
tem of spectrum usage, a number
of benefits would accrue. The
primary benefit would be that
the broadcasting industry would
be self-regulated. If there were
overlapping spectra causing in
terference and discomfort for the
viewer, one of the stations would
not be able to sell its advertising
time and would thus be driven
off the air.
Furthermore, because of open
access to broadcast spectra, the
networks would not be able to
control the television media as
they presently do. Open access
would permit many smaller sta
tions to arise and thrive, thus
promoting more diverse and
higher quality programming.
Such smaller stations would
not have as their goal to
maximize their audiences from
among the many diverse in
terests of the viewing public.
Their goals would be to
maximize the quality of their
particular types of specialized
programming so as to attract and

retain as large an audience as
possible from among those in
terested in their specialties.
Ultimate end
The ultimate end of such an
open access system would be
that the large central networks
would no longer exist as the all
powerful controllers of the qual
ity of television programming.
The consequence of such a
tremendous change in the tele
vision industry would be a total
change in the concept of adver
tising through television.
Advertisers would he forced to
redesign their concept of televi
sion, since the medium woidd
no longer be designed around
the needs and desires of adver
tisers, but rather around the var
ied entertainment demands of
the public.
They would have to seek out
combinations of types and qual
ities of programming which
would best sell their products.
They would not be able to look
for the individual program
which attracted the largest audi
ence possible.
A whole new set of data would
have to be developed for market
ing through television.
Basic change
Unfortunately for the quality
and diversity of television prog
ramming, such a basic change in
the makeup of the American
television broadcasting system
could never be successfully ac
complished.
The constraints within the
present system which would
hinder its success are based on
the present power of the net
works' lobbies in Washington.
Open access would sufficiently
damage the networks that they
would fight hard to impede any
changes in the communications
law which would decontrol the
industry. â€¢
And the reality is that, with
large political action committees
within the networks, as well as
through the power of the news,
Washington politicos would run
scared of crossing the networks.
So, just as William Paley had
many years of success in the in
dustry he helped to develop, his
successor, marketing expert
John Backe, can look forward to
many years of potential success
using the expertise in marketing
which he has developed under
the present broadcasting system
in which television is an adver
tising medium.
