# Taiwanese spying flabbergasting
## 
### 
Yuan Pang, Jia-Dong Shea

We are flabbergasted by that
three-day article about Taiwan
(Daily, April 27-29). Was it ever
intended to bring out the facts or
was it really a deliberate attempt
by a callous person to damage
the reputation of the Republic of
China, and create an "atmos
phere of suspicion" among
Chinese students from Taiwan?
Having read that article care
fully, we can only conclude that
the latter might be the case.
We hardly believe that a gen
erally reputable, unbiased and
objective newspaper like the
Daily would allow such a
grossly prejudiced, blatantly
exaggerated and terribly mis
leading article to have appeared
on its front page for three con
secutive days.
While that article presented
the alleged difference in opinion
[among Chinese students from
•Taiwan as a "tense struggle," the
author either intentionally, re
cklessly or perhaps innocently
played down the number of stu
.dents supporting our govern
•ment by referencing only the
'opinion of "two students."
It inevitably gives the readers
the impression that the majority
of the Chinese students from
Taiwan here are opposing our
country. This is completely con
trary to the fact.
Gov't criticism
Although physically absent
from their country, Chinese stu
dents from Taiwan often
criticize their government
purely out of love, concern and
goodwill. Our opinions may
sometimes vary, yet we have a
common goal in the betterment
of our country.
We get along with each other
very well and socialize together
happily as much as possible in
the limited leisure time that we
have. The existence of "govern
ment spies" among us is unani
mously considered as not only
impossible but absurd.
Frankly, for what the articles
are worth, they have practiced
what they preached themselves
by really creating singlehan
dedlv an unprecedented atmos
phere of suspicion among us. If it
has not done so already, this will
inevitably affect our ability to
study and our social life as well.
We also question the motive
and propriety in basing a series
of next to defamatory articles on
the reputed evidence of a few
students.
it is a shame that there are "re
portedly" a few students who
take such pride in slandering a
government which has fur
nished them security and stabil
ity for their entire life, or at least
28 years of it.
As far as we are concerned, we
do not want even to associate
ourselves with them, that is as
suming these "few students" do
exist.
Passport problems
In one of his articles, Kurt
Cobb reported . . for people
who make trouble their
passports are renewed every
three to six months . . ."and". . .
some might be brought back to
Taiwan and sentenced to certain
years in prison because they had
been seen reading mainland
Chinese publications. . . ."
We have never heard of such
outrageous concoctions. In his
sparetime, Cobb can stroll over
to the East Asian Collection of
Hoover Institution (which
boasts of one of the better collec
tions on mainland China) and
see for himself the vast number
of students from Taiwan there.
They frequently read publica
tions on, and from the mainland;
and we wonder how many of
them have disappeared over
night because of such alleged
spying.

, Furthermore, Cobb main
tained that . . their parents are
notified and sometimes
threatened. . . That is not true
either. To the best of our know
ledge, there was a case in which
a student supposedly had pro
communist convictions. But
then, his parents came here to
visit him and returned to Taiwan
with no restriction whatsoever
last year.
Political asylum
As for the instance of one stu
dent who Cobb mentioned had
sought political asylum, we
loathe and shudder to think that
there could be one who would go
so far as to defame and denounce
one's own country to achieve
one's personal goal in remaining
in the U.S. political asylum, in
deed, a poor excuse.
We must stress that people of
the Republic of China are not
quite as fortunate as people of
this country. Among other
things, they had suffered con
tinuously from the chaos
brought on by one war after
another for 38 years.
Initially, there were civil wars
among warlords. Thereafter,
came the eight-year battle
against Japanese aggression, to
be followed by struggle against
communism.
Even after we settled down in
Taiwan, we still face the ever
menacing threat of mainland
China. The Chinese communists
have not given up their intention
to take over Taiwan by force and
have never ceased shelling our
frontmost isles, Quemoy and
Matsu in the last 28 years.
Communist agents also persist
in attempting to paralyze our
free sotiitjiy from within by in
filtration, subversion, rumors
and violence. In order to pre
serve our traditions, culture, and
to protect our democratic ideals,
and liberal lifestyle, our greatly
outnumbered people in Taiwan
have no alternative but to main
tain a state of constant mental as
well as military alert.
Martial law
These facts explain why our
government outlaws any com
munist activities and maintains
martial law in Taiwan. Although
the existence of martial law
brings inconvenience to some of
us in our daily lives, it has

nevertheless kept for us the lib
erty which would have been de
prived by the Chinese com
munists.
Above all, the present state has
blessed us with a peaceful, pros
perous and safe society for 28
years.
It is axiomatic that one man's
meat may be another's poison.
Conversely, each country has its
own situation, problems and in
herent difficulties. One cannot
expect all countries to react or
behave the same way to a given
issue. Although our country is
not perfect, it is far, far better
than many other countries and
certainly different from what a
few dissenting students would
have one believe.

In summation, our concern is
that in the future patriotic and
caring students from Taiwan
will hesitate in voicing support
for their country for fear of being
mistakenly labelled as govern
ment spies. We only wish that
Cobb's enthusiasm in his report
ing had been matched equally by
his conscientiousness in seeking
the truth.
In the true tradition of good
journalistic practice, perhaps
Cobb would favor us with a more
objective re-examination and
re-appraisal of what he had al
leged to be the truth.
