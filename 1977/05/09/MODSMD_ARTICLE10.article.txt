# Protest for SCRIP demands
## 
### 
Gardner et al.

1) We demand the University
vote its 94,000 Ford Motor Com
pany shares in favor of the stock
holder resolution mandating
Ford's withdrawal from South
Africa. This issue is clear. All the
criteria on investment policy for
a yes vote have been met, yet the
trustees still plan to abstain.
2) We demand that the trustees
abolish the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR)
and that a new commission with
real power be created that repre
sents all University constituen
cies. Right now there is an elabo-

rate process that theoretically
insures all constituencies have
input into the University's in
vestment policy. This system is
such an obvious failure that not
even its originators will defend
it now.
Student input is not seriously
considered. Staff input is not
considered at all. Faculty input
is minimal. The Stanford Com
mittee for Responsible Invest
ment Policies (SCRIP) advocates
the abolition of the C-IR and the
removal of the vice president for
finances and the trustee commit

tee on investments from this
decision-making process. One
committee —with students, fa
culty and staff—should present
its decisions directly to the
Hoard of Trustees for ratifica
tion.
:i) We demand that a report be
prepared by Oct. 1, 1977, de
scribing the costs and benefits
which would result from the
University's divestment of its
shares in corporations operating
in South Africa. It is the SCRIP
position, shared by many others,
that the University should sell
its shares in corporations that
continue to make a profit out of
apartheid South Africa. There
can be no intelligent
community-wide debate on this
issue unless the University pre
pares the financial information
on divestiture.
Since we feel every day is crit
ical in South Africa, we demand
that the trustees immediately
commission the preparation of
this report so that the University
community can examine it in the
fall.
SCRfP therefore issues a cal I to
the University community:
Today there will be a de
monstration to back up the four
demands that SCRIP has made to
the Board of Trustees.
bast Tuesday—in the largest
rally and march that the Univer
sity has seen in years—hundreds
of students, faculty and staff
asked the trustees to reopen the
question of how the University
would vote on the remaining
stockholder resolutions on
South Africa. The trustees have
continued to abstain on these re
solutions. Now there is only one
left, Ford, on May 12.
SCRIP has put forward four
demands. Some people object to
demands on principle. We are
not insensitive to these feelings.

However, on such a clear moral
issue as South Africa, and in the
face of the board's startling re
fusal to even reopen this issue,
we find ourselves with little real
choice. We have gone through
their process, we have satisfied
their difficult criteria, we have
talked with all the appropriate
administrators and trustees
again and again. For nothing.
Now it is time to act.
There is a trustee Committee
on Investments meeting today in
San Francisco and a full board
meeting there tomorrow. South
Africa will be with us next year,
of course; scrip promises that.
But we feel there is no justifi
cation for the University's re
lusal to act now. We feel that if
the University meets our de
mands. a small, but real, step
will have taken in removing U.S.
investment from apartheid
South Africa—and therefore a
step will have been made in the
eventual liberation of that coun
try. The situation in South Africa
is so unjust that no step, however
small, should be delayed.
If you agree with any or all of
these demands—protest.
If you feel the University
should not make money off
apartheid— protest.
If you signed the petition —
protest.
If you wore a black
armband—protest.
If you fasted—protest.
If you give a damn—protest.
Noon—White Plaza.
