# Pass proxy resolutions

Campus Report (May 4) carries a front page arti
cle worth reading by all students concerned about
South Africa: "Senate reviews proxy procedure,
hears Abernethy."
The SWOPSI-SCIRE director suggests what is
referred to as "a moderate positive approach" in
his role as a member of the Faculty Senate. It is a
statement appropriate for that deliberative body
and provides a basis for that campus consensus
that the University Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) is expected to express to the
trustee board.
It should be welcomed as a first step toward
creating consensus for support of the proxy resolu
tions on which, at the moment, the trustees have
voted abstention. It calls for the initiative of dis
cussions between the corporations and the South
African government.
Passage of the proxy resolutions would
strengthen the hands of the American firms, as
suming they really are. as they claim, opposed to
apartheid.
These proxy resolutions do not call tor the cor
porations to begin dismantling their operations in
South Africa. All they reaily do is to ask them to
say, "We can't operate efficiently when we are
discouraged or prevented from using non-white
skills at all levels of production, distribution and
exchange, including management and supervi
sion.
Our investments are made insecure because
governments' repressive policies are building up
resentments and tensions that are bound to

explode in future violence, perhaps revolutionary
in nature.
We shall not support armed intervention by our
country when that occurs. Unless the South Afri
can government shows concrete evidence within
the near future of creating the kind of social and
political conditions in which our future seems
secure, we shall have to consider withdrawal from
the country.
Meanwhile, we do not intend to expand our
"investments." These companies need the lever
age of being able to say, "A growing number of our
influential stockholders are urging us to take this
action."
Why should the University be reluctant to join
the numerous church groups and others that can
supply the corporations some leverage to achieve
the goals they say they haveâ€”abolition of apar
theid?
1 think the University should go a step further
and draft a proxy resolution of its own calling
upon the corporations, even though they stay in
South Africa, to refuse to invest in the new puppet
"Jim Crow" states being created to prevent Afri
cans from becoming full-fledged voting citizens in
South Africa.
Even the U S. State Department has refused to
recognize the "independent" Transkei, as has the
United Nations. Why should the corporations
break this consensus by investing in them?
