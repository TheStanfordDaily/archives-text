Prophetic finger
Shannon Blando accurately
identified inconsistencies in
Anita Bryant's Christian wit
ness. Indeed, the prophetic
finger which lines up with the
status quo and points only at
selected objects of God's wrath
(and mercy) undermines its own
integrity. And the American
church has all too often acted
more like a country club than an
agent of God's healing, good
news.
But sometimes even the
prophets who check prophets
must be checked. Though
Blando was perhaps hampered
by the copy space which limits
all columnists, something must
be said about her inapprop
riately naive treatment of the Bi
ble.
It is misleading to say that "the

Bible often sanctions institu
tions...such as slavery and
polygamy." Misuses of biblical
accounts of past societies not
withstanding. the Bible under
girded Elizabeth Fry's, Lord
Shaftsbury's, William Wilber
force's and John Wesley's battles
against slavery. And inasmuch
as the New Testament outlaws
polygamy, it is not surprising
that the hallmarks of the early
church were love and
monogamy.
As long as Blando uses the
very Bible she tries to discredit
to judge Bryant, she should use it
consistently. I.ike it or not, the
same New Testament figure who
said, "love is fulfillment of the
Law" also said, "homosexuals
shall not inherit the kingdom of
God." *
By calling on us to "repudiate

using t lie Bible as a source ol au
thority for civil law." Blando
makes room tor leaders and sys
tems she would rightly decry.
Societies built upon nothing
above the arbitrariness of an
thropocentricism include Hi
tler's Germany. Witness the
Nazi's inclusion of "Bible in
quirers" with Jews and
homosexuals at Dachau.
Finally, while one is repudiat
ing the Bible's relevance to civil
law, it is unwise to appeal to the
separation of church and state as
though that were some awe
some. lofty absolute. One begins
to sound I ike a proponent of that
peculiar logic that outlaws
prayer in schools funded by
money that says, "in Clod we
trust."
