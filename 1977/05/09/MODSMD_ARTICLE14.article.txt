# Carter ends summit

### 
London (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter and the leaders of
six other non-Communist in
dustrial nations ended their
two-day Downing Street summit
conference yesterday, saying the
"most urgent task" was to create
johs while cutting inflation.
They pledged to "maintain the
momentum" of economic
growth, expand trade and begin
an urgent study of ways to ex
pand the use of nuclear energy
while preventing the spread of
atomic weapons.
A surprise decision called for
a ban against irregular practices
and improper conduct in inter
national trade.
Endorsement
Carter endorsed the action,
saying, "we believe the time has
come for international control
and prohibition against il
legalities, bribery, extortion and
other actions that have some
times been condoned in trade,

commerce and banking."
Last year's Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. scandal shook the gov
ernments of Japan, Italy, the
Netherlands and other nations
after it was revealed that pay
ments were made to political
leaders to influence the sales of
planes.
The summit conference com
munique did not contain a
statement of support for Carter's
campaign against human rights
violations. But U.S. Treasury
Secretary W. Michael Blumen
thal told a news conference there
was unanimous agreement
among the leaders that Carter
was correct in principle in his
actions.
Two-day summit
Meetings were held Saturday
and yesterday at No. 10 Downing
St., the home of Britain's prime
ministers.
The leaders, who referred to
their meeting as the "Downing

Street Summit," said in a 700-
word joint communique they
were committing their govern
ments to meet the targets for
economic growth they previ
ously had set to "provide a basis
for sustained noninflationary
growth" around the world.
"We are determined to re
spond collectively to the chal
lenges of the future," they said.
"Our most urgent task is to
create more jobs while continu
ing to reduce inflation."
Carter, making his first foreign
trip since being elected presi
dent, said "far-reaching deci
sions" had been made.
"We have obligations to fulfill
and in many ways our own repu
tation is at stake to carry out the
promises we made this after
noon," he said in his remarks.
Each leader commented after

claration.
