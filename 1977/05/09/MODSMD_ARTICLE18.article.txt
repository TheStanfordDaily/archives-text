# Rain dampens Cards' sweep
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford baseball team
robbed UCLA of their last hope
for the Pac:ific-8 Southern Divi
sion championship this
weekend by defeating them 5-4
in 10 innings Friday afternoon,
and 19-3 Saturday before being
beaten by both the weather and
the Bruins on Sunday, 7-1 in
seven innings.
After Friday's extra-inning
thriller the teams were
scheduled to play a doub
leheader on Saturday, but thun
dershowers washed out the sec
ond game of that set after only
two innings of play. Meeting
again on Sunday to make up that
game, the two teams battled a
steady rain from the bottom of
the fourth to the top of the
seventh innings before the um
pires called thegame with UCLA
ahead 7-1.
Evenly matched
On Friday the two teams lived
up to coach Mark Marquess' ex
pectations, playing an extremely
evenly matched game. UCLA
scored three unearned runs in

the first three innings to jump
out to a quick lead, but watched
their lead vanish over the next
two innings.
Stanford scored one run in the
bottom of the third on a RBI
ground out by Larry Reynolds
after PepeHinojosa led off with a
triple into the right field corner.
In the fifth Stanford assumed the
lead scoring three runs on a tri
ple by Reynolds with Bruce Wal
ters and Todd Ervin on base, and
a controversial base hit by Randy
Wong.
Yandle relieved
Stanford starting pitcher Brian
Harrison held the Bruins score
less through the next three in
nings until he was relieved by
senior staffer John Yandle in the
eighth. Yandle made the
ballgaine his own in the top of
the ninth when he yielded a solo
homerun to the designated hitter
Craig Johnson which tied the;
game at four apiece.
Stanford went down one-two
three in the bottom of the ninth
inning, but kept the score as it
stood and came back in the tenth

to score one run on another RBI
single by Reynolds with the
bases loaded and no outs.
On Saturday Stanford annihi
lated the Bruins by a 19-3 margin
paced once again by the expert
hitting of Larry Reynolds and the
strong pitching of sophomore
lefthander Rob Irwin. Reynolds
went 4-5 with two RBl's while
the rest of the Cardinals com
bined for 15 other hits exhaust
ing four UCLA pitchers. Irwin
lasted the full nine innings turn
ing in an excellent performance,
giving up only five hits and three
runs — all one run blasts over the
right field fence.
New team record
The Cardinals set a new team
record with Saturday's win tor
the most victories in a single sea
son, upping their record to 43-18
for 1977.
The rain dampened the Cards
momentum on Sunday and
UCLA came back to soak Stan
ford 7-1 in seven innings. Jerry
Argust absorbed the loss for the
Cardinals after giving up four
runs on seven hits in 4-2/3 in

nings.
The Cardinals only run came
in the bottom of the sixth when
Pepe Hinojosa tripled to right
field with one man away. After
Todd Ervin lined out to the
pitcher, Larry Reynolds reached
Hist base on an error which
scored Hinojosa. The game was
called before Stanford got
another chance at bat.

the most victories in a single sea
son, upping their record to 43-18
for 1977.

The Stanford baseball team
robbed UCLA of their last hope
for the Pac:ific-8 Southern Divi

weekend by defeating them 5-4
in 10 innings Friday afternoon,
and 19-3 Saturday before being
beaten by both the weather and
the Bruins on Sunday, 7-1 in
seven innings.
After Friday's extra-inning
thriller the teams were
scheduled to play a doub
leheader on Saturday, but thun

two innings of play. Meeting
again on Sunday to make up that
game, the two teams battled a
steady rain from the bottom of
the fourth to the top of the
seventh innings before the um
pires called thegame with UCLA
ahead 7-1.
Evenly matched
On Friday the two teams lived
up to coach Mark Marquess' ex
pectations, playing an extremely
evenly matched game. UCLA
scored three unearned runs in

the first three innings to jump
out to a quick lead, but watched
their lead vanish over the next
two innings.
Stanford scored one run in the
bottom of the third on a RBI
ground out by Larry Reynolds
after PepeHinojosa led off with a
triple into the right field corner.
In the fifth Stanford assumed the
lead scoring three runs on a tri
ple by Reynolds with Bruce Wal
ters and Todd Ervin on base, and
a controversial base hit by Randy
Wong.
Yandle relieved
Stanford starting pitcher Brian
Harrison held the Bruins score
less through the next three in
nings until he was relieved by
senior staffer John Yandle in the
eighth. Yandle made the
ballgaine his own in the top of
the ninth when he yielded a solo
homerun to the designated hitter
Craig Johnson which tied the;
game at four apiece.
Stanford went down one-two
three in the bottom of the ninth
inning, but kept the score as it
