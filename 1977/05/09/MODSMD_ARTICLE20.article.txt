# So what else is new?
## Cards jinxed in Fresno 
### Bruce Anderson 
It's getting such that the trip to
Fresno for the West Coast Relays
isn't worth it for Stanford's cin
dermen.
Last year distance standout
Tony Sandoval was spiked in the
Achilles tendon and steeple
chaser Stacy Ceiken injured
himself so seriously when he hit
a steeple barrier that he was lost
for the season.
Saturday sprinter-long juniper
James Lofton and javelin
thrower Ricky Brown sustained
injuries just a week before this
Friday and Saturday's Pacific-8
championships in Los Angeles.
Lofton picked up a twinge in
his hamstring on the impact of
his winning 25-6>/ 2 leap. His
jump beat (JSC freshman Larry
Doubley, who is considered to be
Lofton's main rival for the con
ference long jump title and one
of his chief adversaries for the
NCAA crown. Doubley captured
second with a 25-2% mark.
Stanford withdrew its 400-
meter and mile relays so that the
junior from Los Angeles could
rest his leg and not risk further
damage in Saturday's cold,
windy weather. It is not certain

whether Lofton will he able to
run the open 400 meters this
weekend although he said he
still expects to jump and hold
down spots on both relay
squads.
Brown, a freshman from New
Orleans, threw 195 feet in the
javelin but also threw his elbow
out. Assistant track coach
Mafshall Clark said it was
"doubtful whether Kicky will
compete at the Pat:-Bs."
Shot putter Terry Albritton,
who was injured earlier in the
season, took third in his spe
cialty behind Al Feurbach and
Pete Shmock. Feurbach and
Shmock both threw67-OV2 while
Albritton heaved the 16-pound
sphere 65-11.
The Card two-mile relay team
of Paul McCarthy, Scott
Hickman, Steve Crowley and
Dave Wells also took third with a
time of 7:37.6.
Up in Oregon, Card runners
Mike Boit and Paul Ceis were
victorious in the 800 meters and
3000 meters respectively. Boit
ran a 1:45.8 —which is currently
the best in the world. Ceis
termed his 7:59.7 a "mediocre
time" and explained the best

American time was near 7:42.
Ceis said the weather in Ore
gon was rainy and said healmost
didn't compete.
"1 fell down in the afternoon
on my wife's parents' back
porch," he said. "I was rushed to
the emergency room at the hos
pital and had eight stitches. For
tunately 1 was able to run and the
cut didn't bother me during the
race. Afterwards though, I had a
really bad headache."
