Men's golf
The Stanford men's golf team
lost Friday's match with San Jose
State by a score of 20-7. Card's
Mike Peck and Jay Johnston shot
75s for the team's best score, but
even so, they could only muster
a Vk point from their San Jose op
ponents, Achin Steinfurth and
Don Levin, who shot 74 and 71
respectively.
The point system in collegiate
golf matches works by giving
one point to a player who defeats
his individual opponent for the
front nine holes, one point for
the back nine holes, and one
point for the total eighteen holes.
Likewise, three points are al
loted to the best two-man medal

play team score. For team scor
ing, one takes the lowest teaiYi
score per hole and then adds up
the holes to arrive at the nine
hole and eighteen hole totals.
The Cards hosted their annual
Alumni golf tournament Satur
day at the Stanford Golf Course.
Alumni Jim Rhein, John Ardell
and former 49er quarterback
John Brodie took the first three
places with rounds of 70, 72 and

The Stanford men's golf team
lost Friday's match with San Jose
State by a score of 20-7. Card's
Mike Peck and Jay Johnston shot
75s for the team's best score, but
even so, they could only muster
a Vk point from their San Jose op
ponents, Achin Steinfurth and
Don Levin, who shot 74 and 71
respectively.
The point system in collegiate
golf matches works by giving
one point to a player who defeats
his individual opponent for the
front nine holes, one point for
the back nine holes, and one
point for the total eighteen holes.
Likewise, three points are al
loted to the best two-man medal

play team score. For team scor
ing, one takes the lowest teaiYi
score per hole and then adds up
the holes to arrive at the nine
hole and eighteen hole totals.
The Cards hosted their annual

Men's golf
The Stanford men's golf team
lost Friday's match with San Jose
State by a score of 20-7. Card's
Mike Peck and Jay Johnston shot
75s for the team's best score, but
even so, they could only muster
a Vk point from their San Jose op
ponents, Achin Steinfurth and
Don Levin, who shot 74 and 71
respectively.
The point system in collegiate
golf matches works by giving
one point to a player who defeats
his individual opponent for the
front nine holes, one point for
the back nine holes, and one
point for the total eighteen holes.
Likewise, three points are al
loted to the best two-man medal

play team score. For team scor
ing, one takes the lowest teaiYi
score per hole and then adds up
the holes to arrive at the nine
hole and eighteen hole totals.
The Cards hosted their annual
Alumni golf tournament Satur
day at the Stanford Golf Course.
Alumni Jim Rhein, John Ardell
and former 49er quarterback
John Brodie took the first three
