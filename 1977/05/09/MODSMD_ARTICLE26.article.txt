Carter to meet with Assad today
Damascus, Syria — When President Jimmy Carter
confers in Geneva today with Syrian President Hafez
Assad, he will be dealing with the pivotal Arab
statesman in Middle Fast peace deliberations.
Assad, 47, is the only Arab head of state who
enjoys good relations with both the United States
and Russia, co-chairmen of the dormant Geneva
peace conference on the Mideast. And he wields
considerable influence over the stateless Palesti
nians, who are at the heart of the Mideast stalemate.
The Syrian president's support is seen as crucial to
any negotiated settlement in the Arab-Israeli con
flict.
Secretary of State Gyrus Vance has said the Carter
administration is gathering "suggestions on the core
issues" in the Mideast —he defined them as the
Palestinians, Israeli borders and a definition ot
peace—before proposing a settlement plan.
As part of this process. Carter has already met in
Washington D.C. with the leaders of Israel. Egypt
and Jordan.
Police, protesters battle over airport
Tokyo — Riot police battled yesterday with
firebomb-throwing demonstrators trying to block
the opening of Tokyo's new international airport.
About 300 protesters and 110 policemen were in
jured, police said.
No deaths were reported, although one person was
in critical condition after being hit in the head by a
police tear gas projectile, officers said. Police ar
rested 33 demonstrators.
The violence erupted after some 3700 students
and farmers confronted 4000 riot police near the new

Narita airport, 40 miles east ot Tokyo.
The demonstrators blocked roads to the a irport, set
tire to two automobiles and pushed the burning cars
toward police lines. One ot the cars smashed into a
house garage, damaging it.
The airport, which is intended to relieve conges
tion at the Tokyo airport at Haneda, has drawn pro
test from farmers and students.
The farmers have objected to the seizure of their
land for the airport project, and the students, who
formed .most ot the crowd yesterday contend the
airport will be used for military purposes. Fnviron
mentalists have also protested against the airport
project because it might require the laying ot a long
fuel pipeline from a nearby port.
FDA requires brochures with IUDs
Washington — Women seeking intrauterine
birth-control devices must be given an easily under
stood brochure explaining the risks and uses of
II IDs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an
nounced yesterday.
"Our goal is to make sure that each woman and her
physician have enough information to select the
most suitable method of contraception," said FDA
Commisioner Donald Kennedy.
The regulation, which takes effect Nov. 7, also will
establish uniform labeling for all types of lUDs.
Kennedy noted that several different types of con
traception are available, and making detailed infor
mation available will help women determine which
type is best for them.
The brochures will describe the device, how effec
tive it is, what a woman should discuss with her
doctor before the lUD is inserted, how to check to see
if the lUD is still in place and what to do if it is not,

what side effects may occur and what can happen if
pregnancy does occur with the device in place.
hi a separate action, the FDA announced Friday
that Holland-Rantos, of Trenton, N.J., one of the na
tion's largest makers of birth-control devices, is re
calling 86,000 of its koro-Flex diaphragms because
they may have holes in them.
They are identified with code symbols F6, CIO, 110
or lo on the rim.
Income taxes for social security?
Washington —The Carter administration is ex
pected to propose using income tax money to fi
nance the Social Security program for the first time.
Administration sources say the plan also would
increase contributions by both employers and
employes. Employers would have to pay the Social
Security tax on an employe's full salary, not just on a
portion of wages.
Under the administration proposal, tax-supported
general revenue funds would be diverted for the first
time to support Social Security when the un
employment rate exceeds six per cent. The fund
transfers would represent contributions lost because
ol joblessness.
The Social Security tax an employe now pays is
5.85 per cent of the first $10,500 he makes in a year.
Under the Carter plan that wage base would be raised
another $2400 by 1985, beyond already planned in
creases.
Today's weather
Clearing today then fair tomorrow. Warmer days.
Lows both nights in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today
in the 60s and tomorrow in the 70s. Chance ol rain 30
per cent today.

Carter to meet with Assad today
Damascus, Syria — When President Jimmy Carter
confers in Geneva today with Syrian President Hafez
Assad, he will be dealing with the pivotal Arab
statesman in Middle Fast peace deliberations.
Assad, 47, is the only Arab head of state who
enjoys good relations with both the United States
and Russia, co-chairmen of the dormant Geneva
peace conference on the Mideast. And he wields
considerable influence over the stateless Palesti
nians, who are at the heart of the Mideast stalemate.
The Syrian president's support is seen as crucial to
any negotiated settlement in the Arab-Israeli con
flict.
Secretary of State Gyrus Vance has said the Carter
administration is gathering "suggestions on the core
issues" in the Mideast —he defined them as the
Palestinians, Israeli borders and a definition ot
peace—before proposing a settlement plan.
As part of this process. Carter has already met in
Washington D.C. with the leaders of Israel. Egypt
and Jordan.
Police, protesters battle over airport
Tokyo — Riot police battled yesterday with
firebomb-throwing demonstrators trying to block
the opening of Tokyo's new international airport.
About 300 protesters and 110 policemen were in
jured, police said.
No deaths were reported, although one person was
in critical condition after being hit in the head by a
police tear gas projectile, officers said. Police ar
rested 33 demonstrators.
The violence erupted after some 3700 students
and farmers confronted 4000 riot police near the new

Narita airport, 40 miles east ot Tokyo.
The demonstrators blocked roads to the a irport, set
tire to two automobiles and pushed the burning cars
toward police lines. One ot the cars smashed into a
house garage, damaging it.
The airport, which is intended to relieve conges
tion at the Tokyo airport at Haneda, has drawn pro
test from farmers and students.
The farmers have objected to the seizure of their
land for the airport project, and the students, who
formed .most ot the crowd yesterday contend the
airport will be used for military purposes. Fnviron
mentalists have also protested against the airport
project because it might require the laying ot a long
fuel pipeline from a nearby port.
FDA requires brochures with IUDs
Washington — Women seeking intrauterine
birth-control devices must be given an easily under
stood brochure explaining the risks and uses of
II IDs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an
nounced yesterday.
"Our goal is to make sure that each woman and her
physician have enough information to select the
most suitable method of contraception," said FDA
Commisioner Donald Kennedy.
The regulation, which takes effect Nov. 7, also will
establish uniform labeling for all types of lUDs.
Kennedy noted that several different types of con
traception are available, and making detailed infor
mation available will help women determine which
type is best for them.
The brochures will describe the device, how effec
tive it is, what a woman should discuss with her
doctor before the lUD is inserted, how to check to see
if the lUD is still in place and what to do if it is not,

what side effects may occur and what can happen if
pregnancy does occur with the device in place.
hi a separate action, the FDA announced Friday
that Holland-Rantos, of Trenton, N.J., one of the na
tion's largest makers of birth-control devices, is re
calling 86,000 of its koro-Flex diaphragms because
they may have holes in them.
They are identified with code symbols F6, CIO, 110
or lo on the rim.
Income taxes for social security?
Washington —The Carter administration is ex
pected to propose using income tax money to fi
nance the Social Security program for the first time.
Administration sources say the plan also would
increase contributions by both employers and
employes. Employers would have to pay the Social
Security tax on an employe's full salary, not just on a
portion of wages.
Under the administration proposal, tax-supported
general revenue funds would be diverted for the first
time to support Social Security when the un
employment rate exceeds six per cent. The fund
transfers would represent contributions lost because
ol joblessness.

5.85 per cent of the first $10,500 he makes in a year.
