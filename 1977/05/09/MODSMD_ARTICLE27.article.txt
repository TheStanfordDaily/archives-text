Yell leader tryouts will he held to
morrow at 4 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
The setting will be identical to that
usually used for Dolly tryouts, but the
format will be substantially different.
The tryouts are part of a selection
process being used to find six under
graduate yell leaders for next year.
A panel of four students and an Ath
letic Department representative inter
viewed yell leader candidates last
week as a first step toward finding
those qualified candidates. The com
mittee is reportedly pleased with the
enthusiasm and imagination of the 14
prospective yell leaders.
"We interviewed ideal people, a
couple of crazies, and a few laid-back
Bill Cosby types," sports information
director Gary Cavalli said. "All of the
candidates emphasized the stereotype
yell leaders won't work here. They also
believe yell leaders should yell with
the crowd, not at it,"he said.
More than 75 students and staff
members will judge the nine men and
five women trying out. Each candidate
will be judged for total appeal on a
scaleof oneto five. Judges will be look
ing for confidence, enthusiasm,
creativity, poise and crowd appeal.
The interview committee will use
scores from tomorrow's tryouts as an
important factor in the final selection
of the yell leaders.
The Band will be on hand for tryouts

to entertain and help judge, Cavalli
said. Everyone on campus is invited to
come to the tryouts.
Cavalli said the forum will be less a
tryout and more an audition, with
some candidates likely to do comedy
routines or jokes, others leading origi
nal yells and nearly all doing "totally
crazy things."
