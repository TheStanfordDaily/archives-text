Whether to ask the Board of Trustees
to reconsider its position on corporate
investment in South Africa will be
among topics considered when the
trustees Committee on Investment
meets this afternoon.
And while the committee meets,
demonstrators at a noon protest rally
in White Plaza will be waiting, "rain or
shine," for the outcome of that meet
ing, according to Chris Coleman, a
rally organizer.
The Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policies (SCRIP)
is organizing the rally as a demonstra
tion of suppott for the demands SCRIP
presented to the trustees on Thursday.
SCRIP demanded that the Univer
sity vote its 94,000 Ford Motoi Com
pany shares in favor of a shareholder
resolution mandating withdrawal
from South Africa, and demanded the

replacement of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility with a rep
resentative committee of "real power."
A report
SCRIP also demanded the Univer
sity prepare a report on the possible
economic effects on the University of
divestment, and that the trustees meet
with SCRIP before Dead Week.
The demands are "reasonable and
right" and represent a consensus
among the community here, according
to Coleman, a SCRIP member.
Asked if the trustees would aficept
the demands, Coleman said, "the
board has not proven to be very re
sponsive."
The issue is no longer merely the
University's complicity in apartheid
but also the trustees' unresponsive
ness, he said.
A group of five student fasters will
attempt to address the investment

committee when it meets in San Fran
cisco today at 2 p.m., according to
Larry Cerf, committee member.
The fasters
Cerf will read a SCRIP statement to
the committee, but it is uncertain
whether the fasters will be allowed to
address the committee, he said.
Last week, 38 students and alumni
began what was expected to be a two
day fast, according to a statement re
leased by the fasters on Friday.
Seven students chose to continue
the fast after Tuesday's march on Presi
dent Richard Lyman's office "in hopes
of establishing a reasonable dialog on
the issue" and communication com
munity consensus on the issue. Five of
the seven will be in San Francisco.
Cerf, the only student member of the
committee, said he thought he had been
assured there would be discussion of
the issue.
"If the committee does not recom
mend reconsideration of the issue to
the trustees, then it probably won't
be," he said.
Today's rally
In anticipation of today's rally, there
has been an unprecedented amount of
communication between protesters
and the administration, Coleman said.
Coleman cited as an example an
hour-long meeting between Lyman
and the seven fasters.
Steve Hansch, one of the fasters, said
the meeting was held to try to convey
the deep concern of many people on
the issue to Lyman.
Lyman, when asked by the fasters
what establishes consensus, said he
didn't know, but that students here
have come about as close as possible,
according to Hansch.
Four demands
According to Hansch. in a discus
sion of the four SCRIP demands;
—Lyman said he would attend the
Trustees Committee Investment meet
ing to present the petitions and to re
late student concerns. As an indi
vidual member of the committee, he
would vote not to reconsider the issue,

however;
—Lyman said "real power" for the
CIR or any other commission is not
possible because the trustees cannot
legally relinquish their fiduciary pow
ers;
—Lyman called "practical" the
drawing up of cost-benefit analysis of
University divestment; and
—Lyman said that the trustees have
a policy of never meeting with student
petitioners.

Seven students chose to continue
the fast after Tuesday's march on Presi
dent Richard Lyman's office "in hopes
of establishing a reasonable dialog on
the issue" and communication com
munity consensus on the issue. Five of
the seven will be in San Francisco.
Cerf, the only student member of the
committee, said he thought he had been
assured there would be discussion of
the issue.
"If the committee does not recom
mend reconsideration of the issue to
the trustees, then it probably won't
be," he said.
Today's rally
In anticipation of today's rally, there
has been an unprecedented amount of
communication between protesters
and the administration, Coleman said.
Coleman cited as an example an
hour-long meeting between Lyman
and the seven fasters.
Steve Hansch, one of the fasters, said
the meeting was held to try to convey
the deep concern of many people on
the issue to Lyman.
Lyman, when asked by the fasters
what establishes consensus, said he
didn't know, but that students here
have come about as close as possible,
according to Hansch.
Four demands
According to Hansch. in a discus
sion of the four SCRIP demands;
—Lyman said he would attend the
Trustees Committee Investment meet
ing to present the petitions and to re
late student concerns. As an indi
vidual member of the committee, he
would vote not to reconsider the issue,

however;
—Lyman said "real power" for the
CIR or any other commission is not
possible because the trustees cannot
legally relinquish their fiduciary pow
ers;
—Lyman called "practical" the
drawing up of cost-benefit analysis of
University divestment; and
—Lyman said that the trustees have
a policy of never meeting with student
petitioners.
Whether to ask the Board of Trustees
to reconsider its position on corporate
investment in South Africa will be
among topics considered when the
trustees Committee on Investment
meets this afternoon.
And while the committee meets,
demonstrators at a noon protest rally
in White Plaza will be waiting, "rain or
shine," for the outcome of that meet
ing, according to Chris Coleman, a
rally organizer.
The Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policies (SCRIP)
is organizing the rally as a demonstra
tion of suppott for the demands SCRIP
presented to the trustees on Thursday.
SCRIP demanded that the Univer
sity vote its 94,000 Ford Motoi Com
pany shares in favor of a shareholder
resolution mandating withdrawal
from South Africa, and demanded the

replacement of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility with a rep
resentative committee of "real power."
A report
SCRIP also demanded the Univer
sity prepare a report on the possible
economic effects on the University of
divestment, and that the trustees meet
with SCRIP before Dead Week.
The demands are "reasonable and
right" and represent a consensus
among the community here, according
to Coleman, a SCRIP member.
Asked if the trustees would aficept
the demands, Coleman said, "the
board has not proven to be very re
sponsive."
The issue is no longer merely the
University's complicity in apartheid
but also the trustees' unresponsive
ness, he said.
A group of five student fasters will
attempt to address the investment

committee when it meets in San Fran
cisco today at 2 p.m., according to
Larry Cerf, committee member.
The fasters
Cerf will read a SCRIP statement to
the committee, but it is uncertain
whether the fasters will be allowed to
address the committee, he said.
Last week, 38 students and alumni
