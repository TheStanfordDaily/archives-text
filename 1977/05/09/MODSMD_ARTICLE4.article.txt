# Physics students upset
## Petitioners protest Albers Wall 
### Wil Nixon 
Over 200 physics students, staff and faculty have signed a
petition protesting the proposed Albers Wall to be built in
Lomita Flaza in front of the Physics Tank.
In addition, about 350 letters have been sent to President
Richard Lyman, according to physics graduate student
Roger Freedman, objecting to the proposed wall.
Saying the nine foot high, 54 foot long wall "may well
resemble a penitentiary-like, confining structure," the peti
tion was sent to Assoc. Provost Ed Shaw.
"My personal feeling is that the wall will not improve the
area. In fact it will detract because this open space is now
used for outdoor classes, frisbee and things like that." said
kathy Peters, a staff member of the Physics Department,
who drew up the petition.
"Very few people who have signed the petition or sent
letters to President Lyman had ever seen what the wall
would actually look like," Shaw said. Shaw contended that
a photograph of a wall mockup in the May 2 Daily "wasn't
very helpful."
Persons will "have a more informed opinion" of the wall
when they see an exhibit about the wall in the physics
building and hear a May 16 talk by Assoc. Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Robert Mittelstadt, Shaw said.

Mittelstadt, head of the Subcommittee on Outdoor Art,
which recommended the Lomita site, said his speech will
"discuss the wall, its designer, and enumerate its attributes
in an attempt to cover the other side."
Having seen the display in the physics building, Peters
and Freedman said they still felt their reaction against the
wall was valid. "The display hasn't changed people's op
position," Freedman said.
Last spring the Committee on Land and Building De
velopment agreed on the Lomita site and Lyman approved
it. Shaw said he was not aware of any protest last spring
over the site. "I'm a little surprised that the protest is com
ing up now.
"In a way," Shaw said, "it's a bit late after we've made
commitments to other people including the memory of the
artist. On the other hand we also have a commitment to the
people on the other side of the issue."
"It is the best location people have advised us, and we
have expended some resources on the present site," Shaw
added.
"Word never got to most people in the department last
spring about the wall," said Peters, "due to an inadvertent
oversight on the chairman's part."
