# 'Half the Sky' wants Women's Center expanded
## 
### Karen Cohn 
A recently organized coalition of
feminist individuals and women's
special interest groups has submit
ted a proposal to Assoc. Provost Ed
Shaw to relocate the Women's
Center, dur to presently inadequate
office and meeting areas.
This coalition, called Half the
Sky, wants recognition of the
emerging women's community
here and this community's need for
a comprehensive communication
center.
Women's Center staffer Carla
I.upi said, "The overwhelming re
sponse of more than fifty women
attending Half the Sky meetings
demonstrates that a vital women's
community does fcxist on this cam
pus.
"However, their need for a usable
Women's Center entails more than a
closet in the Bridge that holds seven
women and a desk."
If new, larger space is obtained,
the women's center will offer
numerous events and services for
women and facilitate collective
support among groups which in the
p.ist have been isolated.
Women's issues
Though Half the Sky is initiating
the proposal for relocation, a new

Women's Center would make office
and meeting areas available to any
groups concerned with women's is
sues or activities.
Lupi said Half the Sky envisions
operating a file of research- and
action-oriented projects related to
women's issues, a home for
gynecological self-help groups, a
24-hour rape crisis line, a feminist
library and a "comfortable place for
women to crash."
Most important, she said, the
Women's Center could provide a
central location for women of all
cultural backgrounds and positions
in the University to interact, so
cially and politically.
These interactions have already
begun in Half the Sky, whose for
mation was catalyzed by the Stan
ford Organizing Committee
(SOC —a coalition of progressive
and Third World groups).
Asked to speak
Four early SOC participants, Les
lie Phillips, Stephanie Erickson,
kathy Gross and Cindy Ell wood,
were asked to speak about women's
concerns at SOC's April 8 solidarity
rally.
Recognizing an ideal opportun
ity to pull women here together,
thev contacted women active in

various groups, according to
Ellwood. These included the Com
mittee on battered Women, Cay
People's Union, Sisters in Stanford,
Chicana Colectiva, Asian American
Women, the Women's Center, An
drogyny House, women's athletics
and various staff, faculty and
graduate women.
Without further publicity, over
30 women came to the initial
gathering.
The spontaneity of 1 lalf the Sky's
formation reflected the urgent need
for such an umbrella organization,
said junior Meriel Uurtle, a Half the
Sky member.
'Forms of oppression'
"Feminism as a totally upper
middle class phenomenon is a
myth," Cross said. "Racism and
sexism and other forms of oppres
sion are part of the same problem.
Unfortunately, in the past we've
been isolated as groups. This is our
chance to start talking and learning
from each other again."
Operating as a collective, each
week a different woman chairs the
meeting. There are no officers and
representatives of the various sub
groups are encouraged to speak lor
themselves as well as their groups.
Last on each meeting's agenda is

a "criticism/self-criticism" period,
which provides an open assessment
to guide the next session.
Members of the collective claim
that despite the diversity of in
terests, meetings are manageable
and productive because of a com
mon enthusiasm and the emphasis
on action-oriented discussion.
In its first month, Half theSky has
already taken action on several pro
jects: seeking tenure for Asst.
Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern,
evaluating health-care services av
ailable to women here and conduct
ing surveys concerning the prop
osal for a new Women's Center.
The collective hopes to create
additional task forces on protecting
women from rape end battery,
evaluating available day-care ser
vices, bettering women's athletics
and establishing a more cohesive
women's studies program.
Half the Sky will also lobby for
changes in University hiring and
admissions practices. According to
the provost's office statistics, cur
rently women account for 7.4 per
cent of faculty here and hold only
-9 of the 734 tenured positions.
Stanford has no tenured black
women and no chicana faculty at
all, even as lecturers.
