# Young leaves on African tour
## 
### 
United Nations, N.Y. (AF) â€” An
drew Young leaves today on a two
week tour of at least a half-dozen Afri
can states, and the self-styled "point
man" of the Carter administration has
drawn fire even before setting out.
Young, making his third trip abroad
and his second to Africa as ambassador
to the United Nations, will be attend
ing a meeting of U.S. ambassadors in
Africa at Abidjan. Ivory Coast, and a
U.N. conference in Mozambique "in
support of peoples of Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia) and Namibia (South-West
Africa)."
In between, he intends to confer
with Vice President Walter Mondale in
Lisbon, Portugal, and to find time for
visits to Ghana, Nigeria, Gabon, Sudan
and South Africa.
Sharpest fire
It was the announcement of the visit
to South Africa that drew the sharpest
fire.
Young had been invited to speak at a
university and to a group of
businessmen in Johannesburg, but a
source at the U.S. mission indicated

the black ambassador also hoped to
meet with some members of South Af
rica's black majority.
South African Foreign Minister R.F.
Botha promptly unleashed a scathing
attack, hinting he might bar Young
from South Africa and saying that his
nation was "not prepared to crawl be
fore the United States, least of all be
fore Mr. Andrew Young."
Young, a former civil rights leader,
infuriated South African whites last
month when he seemed to question the
white minority government's legiti
macy. Observers also suggested that
Botha's attack on Young might have
been motivated by the fact that the
foreign minister is running for a seat in
parliament this week.
Preventing bloodshed
In New York, Young, newly re
turned from a trip to Guatemala, de
clared it had never been his intention
to stir up trouble. 1 le said the only pur
pose of his visit was to help prevent
bloodshed among whites and blacks in
South Africa, where violent protests
against the white regime's racial
policies have occurred more fre
quently in the past year.
Young said that as far as he was con
cerned the visit would take place as
scheduled, and the State Department
said it was going ahead with arrange
ments.
The visit to South Africa is
scheduled for May 19 to 20, the same
time Mondale will be meeting in Vie
nna with South African Prime Minis
ter John Vorster in efforts to make
progress on the question of white
governed Rhodesia's future.
Even before the spat with Botha,
Young's decision to attend the confer
ence in Maputo, Mozambique, stirred
up some debate at the United Nations.
