Hampshire College has sold all
$200,000 of its stock holdings follow
ing a four-day occupation of adminis
trative offices by 20 students protest
ing Hampshire's holdings in U.S. cor
porations active in South Africa.
At a joint press conference between
President Charles Longsworth and
members of the Hampshire College
Committee for the Liberation of South
Africa (CLSC) on Saturday, it was an
nounced that Hampshire had con
verted its entire stock portfolio into
cash, to be reinvested after the drafting
of a new investment policy, according
to Richard Bernstein, editor of the
Amherst Student.
The CSLA occupied the first floor of
Cole Science Center early Wednesday
morning and presented the college
with four demands, Bernstein said.
The demonstrators demanded
1 iampshire sell $39.000 of holdings in
Texaco, Exxon, International Harves
ter and Clark Equipment, and that
Hampshire publicly take a stand
against the South African regime and
U.S. corporate involvement there, he
said.
The CSLA also demanded Hamp
shire draft a general investment policy
with moral and political guidelines,
subject to approval by a college com

munity referendum, Bernstein said.
On Wednesday, CSLA spokesman
Victor Fresco told the Amherst Stu
dent, "We have exhausted all estab
lished channels within the system in
our divestiture campaign and feel it
necessary that as serious an action as
occupation be taken."
Fresco said, "It's all very simple.
These guys (theadministration) are all
real professionals and very slick.
We're not slick, but we're right."
A rally outside Cole on Wednesday
attracted more than 200 people, as stu
dents and faculty speakers expressed
support for the occupiers of the build
ing.
On Saturday, Longsworth said,
"Hampshire College should have, and
should have had, an investment policy
which takes into account moral and
ethical concerns, as well as financial."
The new investment policy is ex
pected to be ready by next fall, Berns
tein said.
Earlier, in response to a petition cal
ling for divestiture signed by three
fourths of the students and many fa
culty, the Board of Trustees had de
layed a decision on the South African
investments until their June meeting,
Bernstein said.
None of the demonstrators were ar
rested.
