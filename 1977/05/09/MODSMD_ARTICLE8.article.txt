## Opinions Liberal arts profitable 
### 
According to a recent survey,
92 per cent of America's mil
lionaires were English majors in
college. I am forced to doubt the
accuracy of this survey because 1
wrote it and very little money
was available to fund my re
search. (Spare change found on
the floor of Memorial Au
ditorium after the Sunday Flicks
let out provided the funding for
this survey.)
Nevertheless, please accept
the survey as fact. Especially if
you are an English major or a
student of any liberal arts sub
ject.
The point? Well, the general

consensus among students
seems to be that a liberal arts
education, as an end in itself, is
impractical. Many feel that no
thing really useful can be gained
from studying political science,
history or English.
"Oh yeah?" rejoin some of

these students. "I'm getting the
satisfaction of studying what I'm
truly interested in. Not to men
tion the skills gained in writing
and researching, and aren't these
practical?"
The truth is, both sides are
wrong.
Practical skills
A liberal arts education is as
practical as a degree from a
diesel mechanics school, en
listment in the army or a close
association with the mafia.
Unconsciously, students in
the liberal arts are obtaining
practical skills that can net them
large salaries upon graduation.
Employers in certain fields are
slowly learning that these col
lege students are actually very
adept at special jobs, jobs for
which uneducated people must
usually undergo rigorous train
ing.
For example, English majors,
from constantly turning the
pages of a dictionary to look up
words like "neowhit
manodorism," have big. .y de
veloped micro muscles in their
index fingers and thumbs. Be
cause of this anatomical refine
ment, these students are per
fectly suited to place the "Ws"
on passing appliances at the as
sembly lines in Westinghouse
factories.
History majors, after four years

of coming up with title pages for
take-home midterms, are very
adept at creating names of re
tirement communities and nurs
ing homes.
Political science people, hav
ing spent most of their under
graduate career squinting to read
gibberish on a chalkboard, have
developed such keen eyesight
that they can do blood counts in
medical laboratories without the
aid of a microscope.
Economics majors have said
the word "bank" so often in the
course of their education that
their lips are highly sought after
by the producers of chapstick
commercials.
By the time they graduate,
philosophy majors have spent so
much time putting things in a
logical order that they make
ideal pinsetters at bowling al
leys.
And communication major
s...well, I'm still checking.
Admittedly, the aforemen
tioned jobs do not provide
someone with work that is
necessarily gratifying. If you ac
cept these kinds of positions,
you must be satisfied with the
knowledge that you are highly
paid and the best in your field.
