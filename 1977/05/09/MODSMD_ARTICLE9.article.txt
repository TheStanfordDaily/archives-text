# Grads need more, diverse housing
## 
### 
Traditionally the University
has had a strong commitment to
undergraduate on-campus hous
ing. Graduate housing, on the
other hand, gets relatively little
attention.
The key rationale underlying
this differential policy states that
the University supplies housing
to provide students with the be
nefit of an extracurricular prog
ram of residential education and

that this program is most relev
ant to undergraduates, since
older graduate students have al
ready had an opportunity to
learn from such experiences
elsewhere.
Given limited financial re
sources, this University policy
has led to a present situation in
which 85 per cent of the under
graduate population and 40 per
cent of the graduate population
are provided with housing on
campus.
About 50 per cent of married
graduate students are accom
modated in these facilities,
while only 25 per cent of the
single graduate population is
able to live on campus. The
single graduate student con
sequently has the least oppor
tunity of anyone to interact with
his/her peers in a residential set-

Excess demand tor housing on
campus exists in all categories of
the student population. Univer
sity officials derive their esti
mates of demand from the spring
housing draw statistics and resi
dence waiting lists.
A special study of the under
graduate housing situation was
completed several years ago,
and the Residential Education
Office is planning to undertakea

study of housing for graduates in
the near future.
Until now there has been little
public discussion of the various
means by which housing for
graduates might be improved,
and little consideration given to
the fact that the demand for
graduate student housing would
certainly increase were the av
ailable alternatives made more
attractive.
Graduate student housing on
campus is presently limited in
quantity, quality and diversity.
The present facilities consist of:
—Dormitory living arrange
ments for 340 single persons (80
per cent males) in Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls. The
residents of these dormitories
are predominantly engineering
and law students, at the behest of
the original donor. These restric
tions further limit the residential
opportunities of single

graduates on campus.
Furthermore, these particular
dormitories suffer from unpopu
larity and do little to foster any
community feeling because of
their cramped facilities com
bined with the absence of any
exclusively Crothers-oriented
food services or eating club.
—High-rise apartment dwel
ling for 308 single students in
Escondido Village. All of these
apartments consist only of one
bedroom and a living room, so
the cohabitants must either
share the bedroom (which is
often a hardship for us cranky
oldsters and those foreign stu
dents not used to the idea of liv
ing with someone) or convert t he
living room to a second bed
room.
—Apartment living fur 1143
student families in Escondido
Village. This space is of two gen
eral types: 379 high-rise apart
ments for couples without chil
dren, with the same facilities as
described above, and 764 low
rise apartments.
In some areas of Escondido
Village, local "communities"
have developed among residen
tial groups, and the Escondido
Village Council does provide a
certain degree of cohesiveness to
village life.
However, this organization
and its concerns are heavily
oriented toward married stu
dents, particularly those with
families, and so once again the
single students are often neg
lected in this residential setting.
—A few scattered spaces
throughout the undergraduate
housing system, most notably
Mirrielees Apartments and
Hammarskjold House.

Undergraduate housing, on
the other hand, offers a wide
array of different living ar
rangements. It is our recommen
dation that University officials
should actively strive to develop
more attractive and diverse
housing alternatives for
graduate students.
Graduates neglected
In our view the University has
long neglected the need to im
prove graduate living arrange
ments here, despite the tre
mendous potential benefit of
such an action for the graduate
community.
Some of the most obvious ad
vantages would include finan
cial savings for graduate stu
dents, better access for graduate
students to the University's
academic and non-academic re
sources and an increase in the
informal social interaction of
graduate students in different
departments.
Housing for graduate students
should be designed, however,
with the distinct needs of
graduates closely in view. The
privacy and independence of a
single room is important, espe
cially for older or foreign stu
dents.
Often a two-bedroom apart
ment is important for childless
couples, in order to permit a suf
ficient separation of activities
that study time at home is not
subject to constant interruption.
Cooperative benefits
Additional cooperative hous
ing provisions would be a great
benefit to other groups, such as
student parents who could help
each other with childcare needs
and other mutually supportive
activities.

Such policy recommenda
tions do not really address one
final problem. How should the
stated need for new graduate
housing on campus be balanced
with the similar requirements
for additional undergraduate
facilities? On the basis of the
present situation, we feel that
graduate needs deserve far more
consideration than they have re
ceived, since the options availa
ble are so much more limited.
An actual tradeoff between
graduate and undergraduate
housing could be partially av
oided were the current con
straints on financing construc
tion of new residences modified.
Under current practices, the
Office of Residential Education
must have the total capital for
new construction in hand prior
to building any new residences.
If, instead, they were to permit
some long-term borrowing
(either from University funds or
with the help of a private len
der), then new housing for grads
and undergrads could be inde
pendently financed and con
structed in immediate response
to any well-documented need.

Graduate student housing on
campus is presently limited in
quantity, quality and diversity.
The present facilities consist of:
—Dormitory living arrange
ments for 340 single persons (80
per cent males) in Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls. The
residents of these dormitories
are predominantly engineering
and law students, at the behest of
the original donor. These restric
tions further limit the residential
opportunities of single

graduates on campus.
Furthermore, these particular
dormitories suffer from unpopu
larity and do little to foster any
community feeling because of
their cramped facilities com
bined with the absence of any
exclusively Crothers-oriented
food services or eating club.
—High-rise apartment dwel
ling for 308 single students in
Escondido Village. All of these
apartments consist only of one
bedroom and a living room, so
the cohabitants must either
share the bedroom (which is
often a hardship for us cranky
oldsters and those foreign stu
dents not used to the idea of liv
ing with someone) or convert t he
living room to a second bed
room.
—Apartment living fur 1143
student families in Escondido
Village. This space is of two gen
eral types: 379 high-rise apart
ments for couples without chil
dren, with the same facilities as
described above, and 764 low
rise apartments.
In some areas of Escondido
Village, local "communities"
have developed among residen
tial groups, and the Escondido
Village Council does provide a
certain degree of cohesiveness to
village life.
However, this organization
and its concerns are heavily
oriented toward married stu
dents, particularly those with
families, and so once again the
single students are often neg

—A few scattered spaces
throughout the undergraduate
housing system, most notably
Mirrielees Apartments and
Hammarskjold House.

Undergraduate housing, on
the other hand, offers a wide
array of different living ar
rangements. It is our recommen

should actively strive to develop
more attractive and diverse
housing alternatives for
graduate students.
Graduates neglected
In our view the University has
long neglected the need to im
prove graduate living arrange
ments here, despite the tre
mendous potential benefit of
such an action for the graduate
community.
Some of the most obvious ad
vantages would include finan
cial savings for graduate stu
dents, better access for graduate
students to the University's
academic and non-academic re
sources and an increase in the
informal social interaction of
graduate students in different
departments.
Housing for graduate students
should be designed, however,
with the distinct needs of
graduates closely in view. The
privacy and independence of a
single room is important, espe
cially for older or foreign stu
dents.
Often a two-bedroom apart
ment is important for childless
couples, in order to permit a suf
ficient separation of activities
that study time at home is not
subject to constant interruption.
Cooperative benefits
Additional cooperative hous
ing provisions would be a great
benefit to other groups, such as
student parents who could help
each other with childcare needs
and other mutually supportive
activities.

Such policy recommenda
tions do not really address one
final problem. How should the
stated need for new graduate
housing on campus be balanced
with the similar requirements
for additional undergraduate
facilities? On the basis of the
present situation, we feel that
graduate needs deserve far more
consideration than they have re
ceived, since the options availa
ble are so much more limited.
An actual tradeoff between
graduate and undergraduate
housing could be partially av
oided were the current con
straints on financing construc
tion of new residences modified.
Under current practices, the
Office of Residential Education
must have the total capital for
new construction in hand prior
to building any new residences.
If, instead, they were to permit
some long-term borrowing
(either from University funds or
with the help of a private len
der), then new housing for grads
and undergrads could be inde
pendently financed and con
structed in immediate response
to any well-documented need.
(Deric Jennings, Hick Hoft and
Stave Wurzburg are graduate
students.)

Traditionally the University
has had a strong commitment to
undergraduate on-campus hous
ing. Graduate housing, on the
other hand, gets relatively little
attention.
The key rationale underlying
this differential policy states that
the University supplies housing
to provide students with the be
nefit of an extracurricular prog
ram of residential education and

that this program is most relev
ant to undergraduates, since
older graduate students have al
ready had an opportunity to
learn from such experiences
elsewhere.
Given limited financial re
sources, this University policy
has led to a present situation in
which 85 per cent of the under
graduate population and 40 per
cent of the graduate population
are provided with housing on
campus.
About 50 per cent of married
graduate students are accom
modated in these facilities,
while only 25 per cent of the
single graduate population is
able to live on campus. The
single graduate student con
sequently has the least oppor
tunity of anyone to interact with
his/her peers in a residential set-

Excess demand tor housing on
campus exists in all categories of
the student population. Univer
sity officials derive their esti
mates of demand from the spring
housing draw statistics and resi
dence waiting lists.
A special study of the under
graduate housing situation was
completed several years ago,
and the Residential Education
Office is planning to undertakea

study of housing for graduates in
the near future.
Until now there has been little
public discussion of the various
means by which housing for

—A few scattered spaces
throughout the undergraduate
housing system, most notably
Mirrielees Apartments and
Hammarskjold House.

Undergraduate housing, on
the other hand, offers a wide

should actively strive to develop

Graduates neglected
In our view the University has
long neglected the need to im
prove graduate living arrange
ments here, despite the tre
mendous potential benefit of
such an action for the graduate
community.
Some of the most obvious ad
vantages would include finan
cial savings for graduate stu
dents, better access for graduate
students to the University's
academic and non-academic re
sources and an increase in the
informal social interaction of
graduate students in different
departments.
Housing for graduate students
should be designed, however,
with the distinct needs of
graduates closely in view. The
privacy and independence of a
single room is important, espe
cially for older or foreign stu
dents.
Often a two-bedroom apart
ment is important for childless
couples, in order to permit a suf
ficient separation of activities
that study time at home is not
subject to constant interruption.
Cooperative benefits
Additional cooperative hous
ing provisions would be a great
benefit to other groups, such as
student parents who could help
each other with childcare needs
and other mutually supportive
activities.

Such policy recommenda
tions do not really address one
final problem. How should the
stated need for new graduate
housing on campus be balanced
with the similar requirements
for additional undergraduate
facilities? On the basis of the
present situation, we feel that
graduate needs deserve far more
consideration than they have re
ceived, since the options availa
ble are so much more limited.
An actual tradeoff between
graduate and undergraduate
housing could be partially av
oided were the current con
straints on financing construc
tion of new residences modified.
Under current practices, the
Office of Residential Education
must have the total capital for
new construction in hand prior
to building any new residences.
If, instead, they were to permit
some long-term borrowing
(either from University funds or
with the help of a private len
der), then new housing for grads
and undergrads could be inde
pendently financed and con
structed in immediate response
to any well-documented need.

Stave Wurzburg are graduate
students.)

Traditionally the University
has had a strong commitment to
undergraduate on-campus hous
ing. Graduate housing, on the
other hand, gets relatively little
attention.
The key rationale underlying
this differential policy states that
the University supplies housing
to provide students with the be
nefit of an extracurricular prog
ram of residential education and

that this program is most relev
ant to undergraduates, since
older graduate students have al
ready had an opportunity to
learn from such experiences
elsewhere.
Given limited financial re
sources, this University policy
has led to a present situation in
which 85 per cent of the under
graduate population and 40 per
cent of the graduate population
are provided with housing on
campus.
About 50 per cent of married
graduate students are accom
modated in these facilities,
while only 25 per cent of the
single graduate population is
able to live on campus. The
single graduate student con
sequently has the least oppor
tunity of anyone to interact with
his/her peers in a residential set-

Excess demand tor housing on
campus exists in all categories of
the student population. Univer
sity officials derive their esti
mates of demand from the spring
housing draw statistics and resi
dence waiting lists.
A special study of the under
graduate housing situation was
completed several years ago,
and the Residential Education
Office is planning to undertakea

study of housing for graduates in
the near future.
Until now there has been little
public discussion of the various
means by which housing for
graduates might be improved,
and little consideration given to
the fact that the demand for
graduate student housing would
certainly increase were the av
ailable alternatives made more
attractive.
Graduate student housing on
campus is presently limited in
quantity, quality and diversity.
The present facilities consist of:
—Dormitory living arrange
ments for 340 single persons (80
per cent males) in Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls. The
residents of these dormitories
are predominantly engineering
and law students, at the behest of
the original donor. These restric
tions further limit the residential
opportunities of single

graduates on campus.
Furthermore, these particular
dormitories suffer from unpopu
larity and do little to foster any
community feeling because of
their cramped facilities com
bined with the absence of any
exclusively Crothers-oriented
food services or eating club.
—High-rise apartment dwel
ling for 308 single students in
Escondido Village. All of these
apartments consist only of one
bedroom and a living room, so
the cohabitants must either
share the bedroom (which is
often a hardship for us cranky
oldsters and those foreign stu
dents not used to the idea of liv
ing with someone) or convert t he
living room to a second bed
room.
—Apartment living fur 1143
student families in Escondido
Village. This space is of two gen
eral types: 379 high-rise apart
ments for couples without chil
dren, with the same facilities as
described above, and 764 low
rise apartments.
In some areas of Escondido
Village, local "communities"
have developed among residen
tial groups, and the Escondido
Village Council does provide a
certain degree of cohesiveness to
village life.
However, this organization
and its concerns are heavily
oriented toward married stu
dents, particularly those with
families, and so once again the
single students are often neg
lected in this residential setting.
