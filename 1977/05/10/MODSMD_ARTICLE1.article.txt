## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Some 294 demonstrators protesting
the University's investments in South
Africa were arrested on trespassing
and failure to disperse charges at a
16-hour sit-in in the Old Union yester
day.
Police began arresting the de
monstrators at 6:50 p.m., nearly two
hours after the official closing of the
build ing. Arrests continued until after
4 this morning.
No one was injured during the ar
rests. However, a molotov cocktail was
thrown over the wal 1 of the service en
trance of the Materials Laboratory
where the sheriffs' buses were waiting.
It hit the ground near a bus and burned
harmlessly.
Over 500 demonstrators first oc
cupied the ground floor of Old Union
altera noon rally in White Plaza which
attracted about 700 persons despite the
rain.
The clapping and chanting protes
ters entered the building to "legally
and non-violently" wait for the deci
sion of the Board of Trustees Commit
tee whether to reconsider a previous
South Africa vote, according to Seth
Foldy, rally organizer.
Four demands
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
which organized yesterday's rally and
sit-in, originally presented four de
mands to the Board of Trustees on
April 28.
The principal demand, which was
denied yesterday, called for the Board
to reverse its previous abstentions and
vote the University's 94,000 Ford
Motor Company shares in favor of a
shareholder resolution mandating

Withdrawal from South Africa.
The Trustees Committee on Invest
ments refused to recommend reversal
of the trustees decision at its meeting
in San Francisco yesterday afternoon.-
The committee met two of the four
demands made by the protesters and
left a third unresolved.
Vote to remain
The protesters voted to remain in the
building and stand by their original
demands at 6 p.m. after extensive dis
cussion.
Once the arrests began, about 450
student supporters outside the Old
Union chanted "Apartheid means pro
fit, Stanford won't stop it" as each de
monstrator was escorted by two Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies to
buses waiting to take him or her to the
campus police station.
About 300 students, many of whom
had been previously arrested and re
leased. waited outside the building
until all of those inside had been ar
rested.
A few protesters went limp when
arrested and had to be carried out by
police. They were charged with resist
ing arrest as well as the trespassing
and failure disperse charges filed
against the other demonstrators, De
partment of Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington said.
Each demonstrator was photo
graphed as he or she stood between
two police officers in a small room in
the Old Union.
Pre-processing
The first demonstrators were then
taken by bus to the campus police sta
tion where they underwent pre
processing. They had the option of
sigriing a citation which allowed them
to leave the station and appear in court
at a later date. »
Those who refused to sign the cita
tion were taken to Flmwood Rehabili
tation Facility in Milpitas. De
monstrators who were arrested in the
late evening were taken directly to
Elmwood, by-passing the pre
processing step. Most protesters were
released on their own recognizance.
According to Herrington, the pris
oners were not read their rights under
the Miranda ruling because the police
did not intend to question them. "This
thing was completely cut and dried,"
Herrington said.
Re-entry
Later in the evening, as arrests con
tinued, a tew students climbed
through second and third story win
dows in order to be arrested along with
those inside.
At least one student was arrested
twice. It is unlikely repeaters will be
released on their own recognizance,
according to Robert Beyers, director of
news and publications.
The incident marks the largest
number of students arrested in the
University's history, according to Her
rington. It is also the largest mass ar
rest of students here.
Herrington said the overtime for the
police would cost the University and

Santa Clara County about $6000 each.
As two policemen wearing helmets
and carrying guns and riot batons on
their belts grabbed each of rally or
ganizer Chris Coleman's arms, he said,
"Thearrests have begun. 1 love you all.
The people of South Africa will be
free."
ASSIJ Council of Presidents Anne
Henkels and Glenn Jordan were also
among those arrested.
Personnel in Old Union interviewed
by the Daily said the sit-in did not in
terfere with the normal flow of busi
ness. The protesters were careful to in
sure access by clearing aisles.
David Harris
At 1:15 p.m., a statement of support
for the protesters was read from 1976
Democratic Congressional candidate
David Harris. It was to be the first of
several expressions of support that ar
rived yesterday.
Statements of support came from
student groups at San Jose State Uni
versity, UC-Davis, IJC-Berkeley, Maca
lester College in Minnesota and from
Tom Hayden and the Commission on
Social Justice of the Archdiocese of
San Francisco.
At 2:30 p.m., after a meeting bet
ween the protesters negotiation com
mittee and Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig, the de
monstrators first learned they might
face arrest.
Ready to arrest
Rosenzweig replied in the affirma
tive when asked by the committee if
the University was ready to arrest the
demonstrators.
"It is not a prospect we look forward
to with any pleasure." he said.
"The policy of the University is to
bring sit-ins to a close as quickly as
possible as the circumstances allow."
he said.
Discussion about whether to sit-in
illegally after the 5 p.m. closing time
for the building began in earnest after
the negotiation committee made their
report.
After a half hour of discussion, the
students voted to remain inside the
building.
At the same time, the protesters were
informed the doers would be closed at
5 p.m. and people would be arrested at
6 p.m. Anyone who wanted to would
be allowed to leave before 6 p.m., but
no one else would be allowed entrance
to the building.
At 5:20 Coleman told the protesters
that Lyman had just informed him
there was "zero possibility" that the
Ford proxy would be reconsidered at
the Tuesday meeting.
Just after 6 David Harris made an
unscheduled personal appearance and
statement of support.
"The University needs to be taught
that their money has some morals," he
said.
Rosenzweig. accompanied by Her
rington and two other officers, entered
at 6:10. After 20 minutes of frequently
chaotic discussion the protesters voted

Immediately afterward.
Rosenzweig, as an officer of the Uni
versity, ordered the protesters out of
the building. Herrington then told
them they constituted an illegal as
sembly. The first arrests followed 10
minutes later.
Peter Bing, President of the Board of
Trustees, addressed the protesters at H
p.m.
Bing said "the whole question of
consensus remains unclear" without
any input from alumni.
He admitted the trustees position
"may be wrong," but that "it is our
personal judgment that continued
presence (of U.S. corporations in
South Africa) will help.
"We (the Board) respect your opin
ion and that is why we are here."
Earlier outside Old Union, Bing told
a group of students, "The trustees are
not in a position to delve deeply or
thoughtfully on proxy resolutions
which are complex issues.
"We are simply dependent on the
recommendation of the Commission
on Investment Responsibility," he
said.
At about 12:30 this morning, flyers
were distributed calling for a rally at
noon today at Columbae.

Some 294 demonstrators protesting
the University's investments in South
Africa were arrested on trespassing
and failure to disperse charges at a
16-hour sit-in in the Old Union yester
day.
Police began arresting the de
monstrators at 6:50 p.m., nearly two
hours after the official closing of the
build ing. Arrests continued until after
4 this morning.
No one was injured during the ar
rests. However, a molotov cocktail was
thrown over the wal 1 of the service en
trance of the Materials Laboratory
where the sheriffs' buses were waiting.
It hit the ground near a bus and burned
harmlessly.
Over 500 demonstrators first oc
cupied the ground floor of Old Union
altera noon rally in White Plaza which
attracted about 700 persons despite the
rain.
The clapping and chanting protes
ters entered the building to "legally
and non-violently" wait for the deci
sion of the Board of Trustees Commit
tee whether to reconsider a previous
South Africa vote, according to Seth
Foldy, rally organizer.
Four demands
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
which organized yesterday's rally and
sit-in, originally presented four de
mands to the Board of Trustees on
April 28.
The principal demand, which was
denied yesterday, called for the Board
to reverse its previous abstentions and
vote the University's 94,000 Ford
Motor Company shares in favor of a
shareholder resolution mandating

Withdrawal from South Africa.
The Trustees Committee on Invest
ments refused to recommend reversal
of the trustees decision at its meeting
in San Francisco yesterday afternoon.-
The committee met two of the four
demands made by the protesters and
left a third unresolved.
Vote to remain
The protesters voted to remain in the
building and stand by their original
demands at 6 p.m. after extensive dis
cussion.
Once the arrests began, about 450
student supporters outside the Old
Union chanted "Apartheid means pro
fit, Stanford won't stop it" as each de
monstrator was escorted by two Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies to
buses waiting to take him or her to the
campus police station.
About 300 students, many of whom
had been previously arrested and re
leased. waited outside the building
until all of those inside had been ar
rested.
A few protesters went limp when
arrested and had to be carried out by
police. They were charged with resist
ing arrest as well as the trespassing
and failure disperse charges filed
against the other demonstrators, De
partment of Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington said.
Each demonstrator was photo
graphed as he or she stood between
two police officers in a small room in
the Old Union.
Pre-processing
The first demonstrators were then
taken by bus to the campus police sta
tion where they underwent pre
processing. They had the option of
sigriing a citation which allowed them
to leave the station and appear in court
at a later date. »
Those who refused to sign the cita
tion were taken to Flmwood Rehabili
tation Facility in Milpitas. De
monstrators who were arrested in the
late evening were taken directly to
Elmwood, by-passing the pre
processing step. Most protesters were
released on their own recognizance.
According to Herrington, the pris
oners were not read their rights under
the Miranda ruling because the police
did not intend to question them. "This
thing was completely cut and dried,"
Herrington said.
Re-entry
Later in the evening, as arrests con
tinued, a tew students climbed
through second and third story win
dows in order to be arrested along with
those inside.
At least one student was arrested
twice. It is unlikely repeaters will be
released on their own recognizance,
according to Robert Beyers, director of
news and publications.
The incident marks the largest
number of students arrested in the
University's history, according to Her
rington. It is also the largest mass ar
rest of students here.
Herrington said the overtime for the
police would cost the University and

Santa Clara County about $6000 each.
As two policemen wearing helmets
and carrying guns and riot batons on
their belts grabbed each of rally or
ganizer Chris Coleman's arms, he said,
"Thearrests have begun. 1 love you all.
The people of South Africa will be
free."
ASSIJ Council of Presidents Anne
Henkels and Glenn Jordan were also
among those arrested.
Personnel in Old Union interviewed
by the Daily said the sit-in did not in
terfere with the normal flow of busi
ness. The protesters were careful to in
sure access by clearing aisles.
David Harris
At 1:15 p.m., a statement of support
for the protesters was read from 1976
Democratic Congressional candidate
David Harris. It was to be the first of
several expressions of support that ar
rived yesterday.
Statements of support came from
student groups at San Jose State Uni
versity, UC-Davis, IJC-Berkeley, Maca
lester College in Minnesota and from
Tom Hayden and the Commission on
Social Justice of the Archdiocese of
San Francisco.
At 2:30 p.m., after a meeting bet

A few protesters went limp when
arrested and had to be carried out by
police. They were charged with resist

and failure disperse charges filed
against the other demonstrators, De
partment of Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington said.
Each demonstrator was photo
graphed as he or she stood between
two police officers in a small room in
the Old Union.
Pre-processing
The first demonstrators were then
taken by bus to the campus police sta

released on their own recognizance.
According to Herrington, the pris

Clara County Sheriff's deputies to
buses waiting to take him or her to the

Earlier outside Old Union, Bing told
a group of students, "The trustees are
not in a position to delve deeply or

said.
At about 12:30 this morning, flyers

Some 294 demonstrators protesting
the University's investments in South
Africa were arrested on trespassing
and failure to disperse charges at a
16-hour sit-in in the Old Union yester
day.
Police began arresting the de
monstrators at 6:50 p.m., nearly two
hours after the official closing of the
build ing. Arrests continued until after
4 this morning.
No one was injured during the ar
rests. However, a molotov cocktail was
thrown over the wal 1 of the service en
trance of the Materials Laboratory
where the sheriffs' buses were waiting.
It hit the ground near a bus and burned
harmlessly.
Over 500 demonstrators first oc
cupied the ground floor of Old Union
altera noon rally in White Plaza which
attracted about 700 persons despite the
rain.
The clapping and chanting protes
ters entered the building to "legally
and non-violently" wait for the deci
sion of the Board of Trustees Commit
tee whether to reconsider a previous
South Africa vote, according to Seth
Foldy, rally organizer.
Four demands
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
which organized yesterday's rally and
sit-in, originally presented four de
mands to the Board of Trustees on
April 28.
The principal demand, which was
denied yesterday, called for the Board
to reverse its previous abstentions and
vote the University's 94,000 Ford
Motor Company shares in favor of a
shareholder resolution mandating

Withdrawal from South Africa.
The Trustees Committee on Invest
ments refused to recommend reversal
of the trustees decision at its meeting
in San Francisco yesterday afternoon.-
The committee met two of the four
demands made by the protesters and
left a third unresolved.
Vote to remain
The protesters voted to remain in the
building and stand by their original
demands at 6 p.m. after extensive dis
cussion.
Once the arrests began, about 450
student supporters outside the Old
Union chanted "Apartheid means pro
fit, Stanford won't stop it" as each de
monstrator was escorted by two Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies to
buses waiting to take him or her to the
campus police station.
About 300 students, many of whom
had been previously arrested and re
leased. waited outside the building
until all of those inside had been ar
rested.
A few protesters went limp when
arrested and had to be carried out by
police. They were charged with resist
ing arrest as well as the trespassing
and failure disperse charges filed
against the other demonstrators, De
partment of Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington said.
Each demonstrator was photo
graphed as he or she stood between
two police officers in a small room in
the Old Union.
Pre-processing
The first demonstrators were then
taken by bus to the campus police sta
tion where they underwent pre
processing. They had the option of
sigriing a citation which allowed them
to leave the station and appear in court
at a later date. »
Those who refused to sign the cita
tion were taken to Flmwood Rehabili
tation Facility in Milpitas. De
monstrators who were arrested in the
late evening were taken directly to
Elmwood, by-passing the pre
processing step. Most protesters were
released on their own recognizance.
According to Herrington, the pris
oners were not read their rights under
the Miranda ruling because the police
did not intend to question them. "This
thing was completely cut and dried,"
Herrington said.
Re-entry
Later in the evening, as arrests con
tinued, a tew students climbed
through second and third story win
dows in order to be arrested along with
those inside.
At least one student was arrested
twice. It is unlikely repeaters will be
released on their own recognizance,
according to Robert Beyers, director of
news and publications.
The incident marks the largest
number of students arrested in the
University's history, according to Her
rington. It is also the largest mass ar
rest of students here.
Herrington said the overtime for the
police would cost the University and

Santa Clara County about $6000 each.
As two policemen wearing helmets
and carrying guns and riot batons on
their belts grabbed each of rally or
ganizer Chris Coleman's arms, he said,
"Thearrests have begun. 1 love you all.
The people of South Africa will be
free."
ASSIJ Council of Presidents Anne
Henkels and Glenn Jordan were also
among those arrested.
Personnel in Old Union interviewed
by the Daily said the sit-in did not in
terfere with the normal flow of busi
ness. The protesters were careful to in
sure access by clearing aisles.
David Harris
At 1:15 p.m., a statement of support
for the protesters was read from 1976
Democratic Congressional candidate
David Harris. It was to be the first of
several expressions of support that ar
rived yesterday.
Statements of support came from
student groups at San Jose State Uni
versity, UC-Davis, IJC-Berkeley, Maca
lester College in Minnesota and from
Tom Hayden and the Commission on
Social Justice of the Archdiocese of
San Francisco.
At 2:30 p.m., after a meeting bet
ween the protesters negotiation com
mittee and Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig, the de
monstrators first learned they might
face arrest.
Ready to arrest
Rosenzweig replied in the affirma
tive when asked by the committee if
the University was ready to arrest the
demonstrators.
"It is not a prospect we look forward
to with any pleasure." he said.
"The policy of the University is to
bring sit-ins to a close as quickly as
possible as the circumstances allow."
he said.
Discussion about whether to sit-in
illegally after the 5 p.m. closing time
for the building began in earnest after
the negotiation committee made their
report.
After a half hour of discussion, the
students voted to remain inside the
building.
At the same time, the protesters were
informed the doers would be closed at
5 p.m. and people would be arrested at
6 p.m. Anyone who wanted to would
be allowed to leave before 6 p.m., but
no one else would be allowed entrance
to the building.
At 5:20 Coleman told the protesters
that Lyman had just informed him
there was "zero possibility" that the
Ford proxy would be reconsidered at
the Tuesday meeting.
Just after 6 David Harris made an
unscheduled personal appearance and
statement of support.
"The University needs to be taught
that their money has some morals," he
said.
Rosenzweig. accompanied by Her
rington and two other officers, entered
at 6:10. After 20 minutes of frequently
chaotic discussion the protesters voted

minutes later.
Peter Bing, President of the Board of
Trustees, addressed the protesters at H
p.m.
Bing said "the whole question of
consensus remains unclear" without
any input from alumni.
He admitted the trustees position
"may be wrong," but that "it is our
