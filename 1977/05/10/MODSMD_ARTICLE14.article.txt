# Congress debates on defense dollars
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —A house
and Senate conference commit
tee, divided on the issue of de
fense spending, may be near ag
reement on a compromise resol
ution that will establish a con
gressional target for federal
spending for the H)7M fiscal year.
The Senate plans debate this
week on proposals to make its
anti-filibuster rule more effec
tive. And President Carter's
energy program and economic
stimulus measures are among
other matters on which (Congress
will be focusing its attention this
week.
The Senate-House conference
committee hoped to reach ag
reement later today on the com
promise budget resolution,
which will set spending and re
venue targets for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
Defense
One key difference between
House and Senate spending
plans is over defense. The Senate
approved spending $111. fj bill
ion, which is $:U)() million less
than Carter asked, but the I louse
cut its defense figure to $1(H).<)
billion.
Over-all, the Senate resolution
projects a $6;t.!5 billion deficit for
1978. while the House figure is
$ti6.:t billion.
Meanwhile, the Senate Cov
ernmental Affairs Committee
appeared to be ready to approve
President Carter's proposal to

create a Cabinet-lev el Depart
ment of Energy. The committee's
proposal is expected to provide
for a sharing of power over
natural gas and oil prices bet
ween the department secretary
and a three-member regulatory
board.
Final say
Under this compromise plan,
worked out by senior committee
members and the White House,
the President would have the
final say over price decisions if
the energy secretary and the
board disagree.
The House commerce energy
and power subcommittee will
devote the week to hearings on
Carter's energy program. Open
ing testimony will be on plans to
give tax breaks to people who
insulate their homes.
The Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee
scheduled a mid-week hearing
on the over-all energy program.
A housing bill on which the
House began debate last week is
slated for a final vote before the
House moves on to a foreign aid
measure. The housing bill in
cludes authorization of $12.5
billion for community develop
ment bloc grants.
On Thursday the House is to
take up a compromise version of
the tax stimulus bill, on which
agreement was reached with Se
nate conferees last week. The hi 11
includes an average tax cut of

$111 for some 45 million tax
payers who use the standard de
duction.
Curbing tactics
The filibuster rules changes
being brought up in tin; Senate
would leave intact the present
requirement tor a three-tilths
majority, or (it) votes, to put the
debate-limiting cloture rule into
effect. But it would curb the r e
of dilatory tactics after that.
In recommending the revi

sions, the Senate Rules Commit
tee said that even after cloture
has been voted it is possible
through various delaying proce
dures to stave off final action on
a measure for weeks.
Ifowever, a Republican minor
ity report called the proposed
revisions "window-dressing to
camouflage the real effect of this
resolution — providing the
majority with more power."
