Sacramento (AP) â€”Despite
the drought. California is pros
pering and will end the fiscal
year with more cash than tin?
$l.i:t-billion surplus predicted
in January, the state's top budget
officer said yesterday.
"We don't think the drought is
going to have that major an im
pact on the state's revenues, or
the economy as a whole, al
though we know it's murdering
some people," Finance Director
Roy Hell said in an interview.
Bell, top budget advisor to
Cov. Fdmund Brown Jr.. said hi;
isn't ready yet to put precise dol
lar figures on the revised re
venue estimates he will present
to the legislative Mav 2:t.

But he said the revised esti
mates will provide even more
money t ban previously expected
to finance programs such as
homeowner and renter tax relief
and the restructuring of local
school finance.
"1 haven't seen final expendi
ture or revenue figures, but at
least in the current year we're
going to be ahead of where we
thought we'd be. And that will
carry over at least in part into
future years," he said.
"We have a feeling that at least
through 1977, and we think
through 1978, things will be in
pretty good shape in the
economy," Bell said.
