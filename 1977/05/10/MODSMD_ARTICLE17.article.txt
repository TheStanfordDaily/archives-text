## Symphony/andrew m. moravcsik Dorabi's performance memorable 
### 
Those who were lucky enough
to hear the San Francisco Sym
phony last week will count it as a
rareand memorable event. Antal
Dorati. the Hungarian maestro,
made his San Francisco debut
with "Music of the Masters":
Mo/art's Lucio SilJci Overture,
Haydn's Symphony No. 97 in
Major, and Beethoven's joyous
Seventh Symphony. Brilliance
on the podium met popular
programming.
Dorati is a I laydn fanatic. I lav
ing just finished recording .ill
1 OH Haydn Symphonies, he is
now embarking on a complete
Haydn opera series on Phillips,
to be followed by the oratorios
and masses, lie is widely
acclaimed as the world's tinest

interpreter of Haydn's music.
Wednesday's performa nee
showed why.
Dorati chose Haydn's Sym
phony No. 97 in (' Major — one
of the lesser known Salomon
symphonies, and a bright noble
example of Haydn's mature wit.
The key to Dorati's interpreta
tion was balance — that En
lightenment fascination with the
symmetry anil proportion of
Haydn is reserved vet passion
ate, witty vet serious, controlled
yet free, light yet forceful, com
plex yet simple. Classic yet
Romantic. All of these paradoxi
cally unified qualities (and
much more) were in Dorati's
Haydn, an effect he created
naturally, without apparent ef

fort.
The diminutive Haydn-size
orchestra filled the cavernous
Opera House with a light deli
cate sound. The violins inter
preted Haydn's specific and var
ied bowing instructions per
fectly. from a do Ice I eguto to a
joking iioticvllo. The wood
winds, under Dorati's constant
vigilance and cautioning left
hand, played with admirable re
straint (after several weeks of
overbearing imbalance). Anil the
brass transcended their medioc
rity, obtaining a bright and crisp
tone — with very few mistakes.
Most important, the orchestra
played together, creating a un
ified whole. The result was a
Haydn performance that one

will experience only 112 f evv times
in a lifetime.
Most performances ot Beeth
oven Symphonies these days can
he classified as mildly Romantic.
Solti, karajan and Ozawa are es
tablished norms. Continuing in
the Classic spirit ot Haydn,
Dorati exchanged the dance-like
drive and some of the Romantic
overview for balance, detail and
chrystal clarity.
Dorati conducted with abso
lute confidence and masterful
skill. He maintained tight con
trol, yet varied the tempo and
dynamics widely. Dorati was not
afraid of silence, and the lirst
movement had some long
pauses, but pauses justilied by
the interpretation. Maintaining
his commitment to balance, he
took all the repeats, a course
rarely attempted either on record
or in performance. The orchestra
responded with a near perfect
technical performance (save the
horns in the Scherzo;. With al
most imperceptible commands,
Dorati corrected balance and
unity problems before they were
serious. It was the vision of a ma
ture artist.
1 personally enjoyed the in
terpretation, as did t he audience.
All my objections are mere quib
bles. mostly about tempo. In
short, Dorati's Seventh was a
brilliant companion to kord's
Eighth and De VVaart's Ninth.
(Next week Seiji Ozawa will di
rect a two soloist performance:
Repighi's Ancient Airs cnul
Dunces, Suite No. with Gwen
dolyn Jones, mezzo-soprano;
Vaughan Williams' Tubu Con
certo (a piece to be taken very
seriously) with Floyd Cooley;
and DeFalla's Three Cornered
Hut. Saturday night's perfor
mance will be at the Flint Center
in Cupertino.)
