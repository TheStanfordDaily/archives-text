# Group meets 2 of 4 SCRIP demands
## Student addresses trustee committee 
### Mike Charlson 
In an unprecedented action, the
Board ot Trustees Committee on In
vestments allowed a student to present
his views before the committee in San
Francisco yesterday.
Yet the committee later refused to
recommend reversal of the board's de
cision last month to abstain on a Ford
Motor Co. shareholder resolution cal
ling for Ford to withdraw its invest
ment from South Africa.
A reversal of the decision was one of
four demands put forth by junior Kim
McCall on behalf of the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP).
The committee, however, accepted
two other protester demands and left
the door open to additional action on
the fourth.
The committee broke with tradition
and heard a presentation from SCRIP
member McCall for nearly 30 minutes
at the request of Lawrence Cerf, stu
dent member of the trustee committee.
hater, President Richard Lyman an
nounced the committee had decided
not to ask the full board to reverse its
Ford decision when it meets today.
The committee did suggest publica
tion of letters written to corporations
explaining the University's abstention
and of responses from those corpora
tions.
Lyman said the board would meet
SCRIP's demand to prepare a report
describing costs and benefits which
would result from University divest
ment of its shares in corporations
operating in South Africa.
He said an Oct. 1 target date for
completion of the report has been set.
and work would start immediately on
it.

The committee also agreed to have
committee members meet with SCRIP
representatives within the next few
weeks to discuss investment issues.
Lyman said he and two other Invest
ment Committee members would meet
with a small number of SCRIP mem
bers.
Action on a fourth demand calling
for abolition of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) and cre
ation of a new commission "with real
power" was deferred because of what
Lyman termed "sufficient unclarity"
as to protester objections to CIR now
and recommendations for change.
He said the issue was far from dead,
however, and proposed it he taken up
when SCRIP and the trustees meet.
Creation of a commission with "real
power" would not happen, Lyman ad
ded, because trustees, not an outside
body, must manage finances and en
dowment of the University.
Overall, six SCRIP members went to
San Francisco for the meeting. Simul
taneously over 500 students sat-in at
the Old Union first floor here.
McCall said he was very happy with
the committee action, calling his re
ception "very courteous."
"I feel that considering the positions
that the trustees are coming from, to
day's activities have been productive
and we will have lain the foundation
for future progress," he said.
Before the committee meeting be
gan, faculty committee member
Economics Prof. Ceorge Bach discus
sed the proxy resolution issue with
SCRIP members. Following the an
nouncement of the decision, Board
President Dr. Peter Bing discussed the
board position at length with the
group.

Bing also drove three SCRIP mem
bers, including McCall, back to the
University and lent money to another,
Steve Hansch. The funds enabled
Hansch to reclaim his van from the San
Francisco Police Department Car
Pound where it had been towed for
illegal parking.
Bach said the committee action was
based on a feeling that American cor
porations in South Africa help their
black employes somewhat whereas it
would do more harm than good to
withdraw.
McCall said his group sought a
"yes" vote on the resolution because
the laws of South Africa were stacked
against the corporations. Others in the
group questioned whether the corpo
rations were doing all they could not to
help blacks.
SCRIP member Larry Litvak said a
"yes" vote would show Ford the feel
ing of shareholders and give com
panies a lever for pressing the South
African government for change. How
ever, no SCRIP members said they felt
the Ford resolution has a chance of
passage.
Ford's annual meeting will be held
Thursday, McCall said.
Lyman said he expects the full board
to discuss the South Africa issue to
day.
Lyman called leaders of the sit-in at
Old Union to report the board action
shortly after briefing SCRIP members
in San Francisco.
He told Chris Coleman and other
protest leaders he felt the Committee
on Investments still feels the letters
sent with the abstention proxy votes
represent a "true condemnation of
apartheid."
He said he thinks the board could go
further with the letters, possibly point
ing out poor profit margins and other
evidence which would suggest di
vestment. However, Lyman said, "I
don't think the board is willing to go
further with the letters."
He was also clearly irritated with
some additional demands Coleman
made by telephone. They included
demanding reconsideration of the
matter with the full board and conven
ing the board last night to meet with
students on the matter.
"There has not been a single trustee
at either meeting (of the board) who
has given the slightest indication they
wished to vote for the proxy resolu,-
tion," Lyman told Coleman over the
phone.
"I am not going to ask the Board of
Trustees to do something against their
wishes" because of pressure on me,
Lyman said.
Allowing a student to present his
views directly to a board committee
would not establish a precedent.
Lyman and Legal Adviser to the Presi
dent james Siena both said.
Siena said he was "surprised" that
the board heard McCall, but said rather
than setting a precedent the action was
a response to an unusual situation.
Bing agreed saying normal
mechanisms for transmitting faculty
and student opinion to the board were

outrun by the pace of events.
Whim explaining Iho board action.
he said no definition for "substantial
consensus" has ever been set by the
board. A board policy governing vot
ing on proxy resolutions states that fi
nancial concerns should govern proxy
vote decisions. When a "substantial
consensus" of the community feels
strongly on an issue, that considera
tion should also enter into the deci
sion, Bing said.
Bing said a definition of the "sub
stantial consensus" should be discus
sed when trustees meet with SCRIP.
He said there was "high student in
terest, but evidence is not there for
consensus."
He said 75 faculty of 1200 does not
demonstrate a consensus and there has
been no input fromalumni on this mat
ter. He said it was debatable whether
3500 students is a consensus.
Bing said he was "sure" the board
would consider putting forth its own
shareholder resolution within the next
year.

board. A board policy governing vot

strongly on an issue, that considera

Bing said a definition of the "sub
stantial consensus" should be discus

He said there was "high student in
terest, but evidence is not there for
consensus."
He said 75 faculty of 1200 does not
demonstrate a consensus and there has
been no input fromalumni on this mat
ter. He said it was debatable whether
3500 students is a consensus.
Bing said he was "sure" the board
would consider putting forth its own
shareholder resolution within the next
year.
In an unprecedented action, the
Board ot Trustees Committee on In
vestments allowed a student to present
his views before the committee in San
Francisco yesterday.
Yet the committee later refused to
recommend reversal of the board's de
cision last month to abstain on a Ford
Motor Co. shareholder resolution cal
ling for Ford to withdraw its invest
ment from South Africa.
A reversal of the decision was one of
four demands put forth by junior Kim
McCall on behalf of the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP).
The committee, however, accepted
two other protester demands and left
the door open to additional action on
the fourth.
The committee broke with tradition
and heard a presentation from SCRIP
member McCall for nearly 30 minutes
at the request of Lawrence Cerf, stu
dent member of the trustee committee.
hater, President Richard Lyman an
nounced the committee had decided
not to ask the full board to reverse its
Ford decision when it meets today.
The committee did suggest publica
tion of letters written to corporations
explaining the University's abstention
and of responses from those corpora
tions.
Lyman said the board would meet
SCRIP's demand to prepare a report
describing costs and benefits which
would result from University divest
ment of its shares in corporations
operating in South Africa.
He said an Oct. 1 target date for
completion of the report has been set.
and work would start immediately on
it.

The committee also agreed to have
committee members meet with SCRIP
representatives within the next few
weeks to discuss investment issues.
Lyman said he and two other Invest
ment Committee members would meet
with a small number of SCRIP mem
bers.
Action on a fourth demand calling
for abolition of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) and cre
ation of a new commission "with real
power" was deferred because of what
Lyman termed "sufficient unclarity"
as to protester objections to CIR now
and recommendations for change.
He said the issue was far from dead,
however, and proposed it he taken up
when SCRIP and the trustees meet.
Creation of a commission with "real
power" would not happen, Lyman ad
ded, because trustees, not an outside
body, must manage finances and en
dowment of the University.
Overall, six SCRIP members went to
San Francisco for the meeting. Simul
taneously over 500 students sat-in at
the Old Union first floor here.
McCall said he was very happy with
the committee action, calling his re
ception "very courteous."
"I feel that considering the positions
that the trustees are coming from, to
day's activities have been productive
and we will have lain the foundation
for future progress," he said.
Before the committee meeting be
gan, faculty committee member
Economics Prof. Ceorge Bach discus
sed the proxy resolution issue with
SCRIP members. Following the an
nouncement of the decision, Board
President Dr. Peter Bing discussed the
board position at length with the
group.

Bing also drove three SCRIP mem
bers, including McCall, back to the
University and lent money to another,
Steve Hansch. The funds enabled
Hansch to reclaim his van from the San
Francisco Police Department Car
Pound where it had been towed for
illegal parking.
Bach said the committee action was
based on a feeling that American cor
porations in South Africa help their
black employes somewhat whereas it
would do more harm than good to
withdraw.
McCall said his group sought a
"yes" vote on the resolution because
the laws of South Africa were stacked
against the corporations. Others in the
group questioned whether the corpo
rations were doing all they could not to
help blacks.
SCRIP member Larry Litvak said a
"yes" vote would show Ford the feel
ing of shareholders and give com
panies a lever for pressing the South
African government for change. How
ever, no SCRIP members said they felt
the Ford resolution has a chance of
passage.
Ford's annual meeting will be held
Thursday, McCall said.
Lyman said he expects the full board
to discuss the South Africa issue to
day.
Lyman called leaders of the sit-in at
Old Union to report the board action
shortly after briefing SCRIP members
in San Francisco.
He told Chris Coleman and other
protest leaders he felt the Committee
on Investments still feels the letters
sent with the abstention proxy votes
represent a "true condemnation of
apartheid."
He said he thinks the board could go
further with the letters, possibly point
ing out poor profit margins and other
evidence which would suggest di
vestment. However, Lyman said, "I
don't think the board is willing to go
further with the letters."
He was also clearly irritated with
some additional demands Coleman
made by telephone. They included
demanding reconsideration of the
matter with the full board and conven
ing the board last night to meet with
students on the matter.
"There has not been a single trustee
at either meeting (of the board) who
has given the slightest indication they
wished to vote for the proxy resolu,-
tion," Lyman told Coleman over the
phone.
"I am not going to ask the Board of
Trustees to do something against their
wishes" because of pressure on me,
Lyman said.
Allowing a student to present his
views directly to a board committee
would not establish a precedent.
Lyman and Legal Adviser to the Presi
dent james Siena both said.
Siena said he was "surprised" that
the board heard McCall, but said rather
than setting a precedent the action was
a response to an unusual situation.
Bing agreed saying normal
mechanisms for transmitting faculty
and student opinion to the board were

outrun by the pace of events.

at either meeting (of the board) who
has given the slightest indication they
wished to vote for the proxy resolu,-
tion," Lyman told Coleman over the
phone.
"I am not going to ask the Board of
Trustees to do something against their
wishes" because of pressure on me,
Lyman said.
Allowing a student to present his
views directly to a board committee
would not establish a precedent.
Lyman and Legal Adviser to the Presi
dent james Siena both said.
Siena said he was "surprised" that
the board heard McCall, but said rather
than setting a precedent the action was
a response to an unusual situation.
Bing agreed saying normal
mechanisms for transmitting faculty
and student opinion to the board were

outrun by the pace of events.

he said no definition for "substantial
consensus" has ever been set by the
board. A board policy governing vot
ing on proxy resolutions states that fi
nancial concerns should govern proxy
vote decisions. When a "substantial
consensus" of the community feels
strongly on an issue, that considera
tion should also enter into the deci
sion, Bing said.
Bing said a definition of the "sub
stantial consensus" should be discus
sed when trustees meet with SCRIP.
He said there was "high student in
terest, but evidence is not there for
consensus."
He said 75 faculty of 1200 does not
demonstrate a consensus and there has
been no input fromalumni on this mat
ter. He said it was debatable whether
3500 students is a consensus.
Bing said he was "sure" the board
would consider putting forth its own
shareholder resolution within the next
year.
In an unprecedented action, the
Board ot Trustees Committee on In
vestments allowed a student to present
his views before the committee in San
Francisco yesterday.
Yet the committee later refused to
recommend reversal of the board's de
cision last month to abstain on a Ford
Motor Co. shareholder resolution cal
ling for Ford to withdraw its invest
ment from South Africa.
A reversal of the decision was one of
four demands put forth by junior Kim
McCall on behalf of the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP).
The committee, however, accepted
two other protester demands and left
the door open to additional action on
the fourth.
The committee broke with tradition
and heard a presentation from SCRIP
member McCall for nearly 30 minutes
at the request of Lawrence Cerf, stu
dent member of the trustee committee.
hater, President Richard Lyman an
nounced the committee had decided
not to ask the full board to reverse its
Ford decision when it meets today.
The committee did suggest publica
tion of letters written to corporations
explaining the University's abstention
and of responses from those corpora
tions.
Lyman said the board would meet
SCRIP's demand to prepare a report
describing costs and benefits which
would result from University divest
ment of its shares in corporations
operating in South Africa.
He said an Oct. 1 target date for
completion of the report has been set.
and work would start immediately on
it.

The committee also agreed to have
committee members meet with SCRIP
representatives within the next few
weeks to discuss investment issues.
Lyman said he and two other Invest
ment Committee members would meet
with a small number of SCRIP mem
bers.
Action on a fourth demand calling
for abolition of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) and cre
ation of a new commission "with real
power" was deferred because of what
Lyman termed "sufficient unclarity"
as to protester objections to CIR now
and recommendations for change.
He said the issue was far from dead,
however, and proposed it he taken up
when SCRIP and the trustees meet.
Creation of a commission with "real
power" would not happen, Lyman ad
ded, because trustees, not an outside
body, must manage finances and en
dowment of the University.
Overall, six SCRIP members went to
San Francisco for the meeting. Simul
taneously over 500 students sat-in at
the Old Union first floor here.
McCall said he was very happy with
the committee action, calling his re
ception "very courteous."
"I feel that considering the positions
that the trustees are coming from, to
day's activities have been productive
and we will have lain the foundation
for future progress," he said.
Before the committee meeting be
gan, faculty committee member
Economics Prof. Ceorge Bach discus
sed the proxy resolution issue with
SCRIP members. Following the an
nouncement of the decision, Board
President Dr. Peter Bing discussed the
board position at length with the
group.

Bing also drove three SCRIP mem
bers, including McCall, back to the
University and lent money to another,
Steve Hansch. The funds enabled
Hansch to reclaim his van from the San
Francisco Police Department Car
Pound where it had been towed for
illegal parking.
Bach said the committee action was
based on a feeling that American cor
porations in South Africa help their
black employes somewhat whereas it
would do more harm than good to
withdraw.
McCall said his group sought a
"yes" vote on the resolution because
the laws of South Africa were stacked
against the corporations. Others in the
group questioned whether the corpo
rations were doing all they could not to
help blacks.
SCRIP member Larry Litvak said a
"yes" vote would show Ford the feel
ing of shareholders and give com
panies a lever for pressing the South
African government for change. How
ever, no SCRIP members said they felt
the Ford resolution has a chance of
passage.
Ford's annual meeting will be held
Thursday, McCall said.
Lyman said he expects the full board
to discuss the South Africa issue to
day.
Lyman called leaders of the sit-in at
Old Union to report the board action
shortly after briefing SCRIP members
in San Francisco.
He told Chris Coleman and other
protest leaders he felt the Committee
on Investments still feels the letters
sent with the abstention proxy votes
represent a "true condemnation of
apartheid."
He said he thinks the board could go
further with the letters, possibly point
ing out poor profit margins and other
evidence which would suggest di
vestment. However, Lyman said, "I
don't think the board is willing to go
further with the letters."
He was also clearly irritated with
some additional demands Coleman
made by telephone. They included
demanding reconsideration of the
matter with the full board and conven
ing the board last night to meet with
students on the matter.
"There has not been a single trustee
at either meeting (of the board) who
has given the slightest indication they
