## S.J. Symphony finishes season 
### 
Last Saturday, the San Jose
Symphony presented their final
concert of the year. Rudolf Fir
kusnv joined the orchestra for
the Schuman Piano Concerto
and George Cleve conducted t he
Dvorak Symphony No. 7.
Rossini's Wiilicim Tell Over
ture initiated the program.
Despite the profoundly jux
taposed moods. William fell is
so much innocent fun that I can't
bring myself to criticize it. Let it
suffice to say that, despite a few
scattered notes, most in the au
dience were smiling all the way
through.
Firkusny is an elegant pianist:
gentle, refined, subtle, seldom
breaking into a forceful style.
Munched over the piano, rarely
flourishing, he carves exquisite
little swirls on the keyboard. His
Schumann was profound but
light.
Unfortunately, the orchestra
didn't agree. Cleve is a forceful

conductor and the symphony is
incapable of an honest piano
(their one great weakness).
Hence, Firkusny was often
drowned out and the concerto
failed to settle into that natural
light romanticism. Firkusnv's
liberal pedaling of the arpeggios
(excessive, to my taste), tended
to decrease clarity further.
Dvorak's Symphom No. 7 is
an exotic plant in the composer's
musical garden. Unlike the
Eighth, based on Bohemian folk
tunes, or the Ninth ("From the
New World"), the Seventh was
heavily influenced by Brahms.
The monumental first move
ment allegro maestoso is a dark,
swirling Brahmsian conception,
and the final movement also fol
lows the German's outline, ex
cept for some eerie string and
clarinet runs a la Mussorgsky.
The most intriguing movement
in the scherzo — it would be
Brahmsian. except he didn't

write scherzos.
Cleve. conducting from mem
ory. infused tremendous energy
into the work. The allegro maes
toso was expansive and exciting,
but the latter three movements
suffered from the continued ina
bility of the orchestra to play
softly. Subtle phrases, carefully
cultivated by Cleve. were forgot
ten in the din.
The acoustics of the San Jose
Center for the Performing Arts
emphasize the bass ( a tact for
which Cleve should have cor
rected). often drowning out the

important upper and middle
parts. However, the performance
was free from technical mishaps
and the brass section was excep
tionally cleanand bright. CleveV
baton gave the work shape and
meaning.
Despite their claim to be tin
oldest orchestra in California
the San Jose Symphony is youth
ful — most members are undei
:<(). Nevertheless, and despite tin
lack of pianos, this is a skillec
and enthusiastic orchestra will'
an equally enthusiastic patron
age. Watch for their next season

Last Saturday, the San Jose
Symphony presented their final
concert of the year. Rudolf Fir
kusnv joined the orchestra for
the Schuman Piano Concerto
and George Cleve conducted t he
Dvorak Symphony No. 7.
Rossini's Wiilicim Tell Over
ture initiated the program.
Despite the profoundly jux
taposed moods. William fell is
so much innocent fun that I can't
bring myself to criticize it. Let it
suffice to say that, despite a few
scattered notes, most in the au
dience were smiling all the way
through.
Firkusny is an elegant pianist:
gentle, refined, subtle, seldom
breaking into a forceful style.
Munched over the piano, rarely
flourishing, he carves exquisite
little swirls on the keyboard. His
Schumann was profound but
light.
Unfortunately, the orchestra
didn't agree. Cleve is a forceful

conductor and the symphony is
incapable of an honest piano
(their one great weakness).
Hence, Firkusny was often
drowned out and the concerto
