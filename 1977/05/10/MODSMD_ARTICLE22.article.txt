## Oregon suffers emotional drought 
### 
Paul McGandless, Glen
Moore, Ralpli ' owner and Collin
Walcott, who in their collective
identity are known as Oregon,
gave an impressive demonstra
tion of one of jazz s worst pitfalls
last Thursday evening .it the
Great American Music Hall.
They played with irreproachable
technical competence but only
occasionally did they emerge
from the lifeless infellectuali/.a
tions which have plagued the
band since its formation five
years ago.

There were two distinct tac
tions in the Music Hall audience
when the band took the stage:
the rabid fans who could find no
fault with their heroes, (con
firmed in their extreme loyalty,
one suspects, by a certain snob
appeal based on the esoteric na
ture of Oregon's image,) and the
less-than-rabi d fans who were
present, one assumes, to hear
good jazz.
The groups sorted according
to their reactions to the music.
The fans of the former catec

ory started their applause before
the final notes of a piece had
been played and continued
clapping long after their ap
preciation had been conveyed.
Their ovations were of uniform
length, indicating that the
approval was for the musicians
and not the music.
The reactions of the latter var
ied markedly with the piece, at
times equaling the approbation
of the former group, at times
barely polite.
The explanation of these di
vergent behaviors can be found
in the disappointingly uneven
emotional energy in the band's
sound Playing a mixture of
pieces from their most recent al
bums, Winter Light and Distant
Hills, unrecorded material and
what Walcott described as
"group improvisation," the
group always hit the correct
notes but seldom with the vital
ity necessary for exciting music.
The problem was especially
apparent when each musician
would embark on his own
meandering way with the
melodic premise and would
completely lose touch with the
other three. For individual
players to keep pace with each
other during such "group im
provisation" it is essential that
they allow themselves to be born
on the flow of the mood — the'
.-subtle feeling of which intellect
is only one source. Oregon de
monstrated that bereft of emo

tion, the musical product of even
the most talented and ac
complished musicians deger
nates into noise.
It is not, however, surprising
that Oregon should be suscepti
ble to this problem. The four
members of the group have bet
ween them more years of formal
musical training than has ia/.z as a
distinct form of music. \lc(land
less (oboe, English horn) ma
jored in oboe at Duquesne Uni
versity and the Manhattan
School of Music. Moore (bass,
piano, flute) has studied bass
and piano under an extraordi
nary variety of musical
luminaries, including Ron dar
ter tor the former and Hill Evans
for the latter. Towner (classical
guitar, 12-string guitar, piano)
majored in music theory anil
composition at the University ot
Oregon and has studied guitar
under Karl Scheit of the Vienna
Academy of Music. Walcott ma
jored in percussion at the In
diana University of Music and
has studied sitar under Ravi
Shankar as well as tabla under
Alia Rakha.
There is no doubt that Oregon
merits the attention of serious
jazz fans; when they did manage
to inject life into their perfor
mance, the result was as cool,
clean and lush as springtime in
their namesake. They have an
original and ,sophisticated
sound — it is a pity that the
Music Hall audience heard it in
such an enervated form.
