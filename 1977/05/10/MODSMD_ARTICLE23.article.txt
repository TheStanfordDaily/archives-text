## Mary Lou Williams: preserving a heritage 
### 
Jelly Koll Morton, Earl Mines, Fats Waller, Art Tatum,
Oscar Peterson and Thelonius Monk all played at San
Francisco's Keystone korner, on one piano, in the guise
of Mary Lou Williams. After a half-century in jazz, Wil
liams has influenced or was influenced by every jazz
great from ragtime to bebop. She doesn't know the his
tory of jazz, she is the history of jazz.
Williams is an important part of what makes jazz un
ique in tht; world of music. Only for jazz is it true that the
people who created it are still playing it, or are at least
within memory. The roots can be learned straight from
the musicians who planted the seeds.
"The history of jazz and the spiritual content of it,
that'salmost lost America is losing a great heritage,"
Williams said recently in a Chronicle interview. "People
try to say that jazz came out of Africa, but it didn't — I
recently played .it Carnegie Hall with 18 African drum
mers, and 1 had to switch to modes; they couldn't plav it.
"It grew in America, and it is an art because it grew out
of suffering, and suffering by a whole race of people, not
just one person. My great-grandparents were still alive

when I was a little girl and I learned from tin; horse's
mouth . . . And," sheadded, "it's not true that only black
musicians can play jazz."
"Little Mary Lou," as she calls herself opened her
show solo, and played a brief chronolgy of jazz styles,
touching gospel. ragtime, slow "healing" blues and up
tempo boogie-woogie. Each variation, however, was
heavily laden with boppish swing and chord structure.
There is no doubt that Williams found herself in the
bebop movement.
Williams' playing is strong and forceful. She powers
the sound out of the keyboard with deep, melodic, block
chords. She's very physical. Her right hand climbs and
descends in single-note repeated patterns, altering for
chord changes.
Backed by bassist Larry Gales and drummer Eddie
Marshall, Williams played Dizzy Gillespie's "Night in
Tunisia," "I Can't Get Started," a piecefrom "Mary Lou's
Mass," which she wrote for the Catholic Church, El
lington's "Caravan," and several of her own slow blues.
Gales, using a bow, played Tommy Dorsey's old theme

song. I m (letting Sentimental Over You," without ac
companiment.
He plays with great technical agility, interchanging
deep, long tones with harmonics and quick, bebop licks,
creating a sound as fluid as an alto saxophone. Marshall
was featured in an extended solo on "Caravan." He exe
cuted ,i one-handed roll and that was enough for me.
V\ illiams was (>7 on Sunday, her biography is interest
ing not only as the history of a jazz musician but also as
the story of a woman. Horn in Atlanta, she joined a
vaudeville show when she was 1 F>. After marrying one of
the men in the band, she and her husband joined Andy
kirk s band and toured with them off and on from 1929
until 1942. They played a great deal in Kansas City and
Williams learned Kansas City Jazz: the boogie-woogie
swinging blues.
She wrote, arranged and experimented for a number of
bands including Benny Goodman's and Duke El
lington's during the swing era. Then she moved to New
York where Charlie Parker, Monk and others were creat
ing bop.

"Little Mary Lou," as she calls herself opened her
show solo, and played a brief chronolgy of jazz styles,
touching gospel. ragtime, slow "healing" blues and up

heavily laden with boppish swing and chord structure.
There is no doubt that Williams found herself in the
bebop movement.
Williams' playing is strong and forceful. She powers
the sound out of the keyboard with deep, melodic, block
chords. She's very physical. Her right hand climbs and
descends in single-note repeated patterns, altering for
chord changes.
Backed by bassist Larry Gales and drummer Eddie
Marshall, Williams played Dizzy Gillespie's "Night in
Tunisia," "I Can't Get Started," a piecefrom "Mary Lou's
Mass," which she wrote for the Catholic Church, El

Gales, using a bow, played Tommy Dorsey's old theme

song. I m (letting Sentimental Over You," without ac
companiment.
He plays with great technical agility, interchanging

Jelly Koll Morton, Earl Mines, Fats Waller, Art Tatum,

Williams is an important part of what makes jazz un

people who created it are still playing it, or are at least
within memory. The roots can be learned straight from
the musicians who planted the seeds.
"The history of jazz and the spiritual content of it,

Williams said recently in a Chronicle interview. "People
