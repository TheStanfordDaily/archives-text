## On the run with Alfred Hitchcock 
### 
A man dangles from a narrow ledge in South Dakota,
clutching an ugly statuette of a Tarascan Warrior. Why
do we care? We care because it is impossible not to. We
care because the man is Gary Grant; because Mount
Rushmore towers above him; because if he slips the
super-sophisticated villain will emerge victorious; be
cause the film is North By Northwest and the director is
Alfred Hitchcock. The director has taken two hours to
lead us to this dangerous precipice, involving us more
and more with each mile of the hero's inadvertent trek
across America in search of a man named George Kaplan
who really doesn't exist.
By the time Grant and his female companion, Eva
Marie Saint.reach the top of Mount Rushmore, Hitchcock
has provided the audience with so much with which to
identify and empathize that it is as concerned with the
hero's survival as the hero is. And that's why we care.
Hitchcock once said. "To me. the great art of the motion
picture is by means of imagery and montage to create an
emotion in the audience." The emotion he regularly
strives for is terror, supplying it by means of incredible
irony and the contrast between the real and the unreal,

the normal and the abnormal.
For the audience to experience true emotional terror,
they must identify with the character and his surround
ings. Hitchcock takes this into account and manipulates
the casting. the story, and the locale so that the audience
will feel as close as possible to both the actors and the
action. Viewer identification makes Hitchcock's films
compelling . as exemplified in North By Northwest
(1959) and Snboteur (1942), two similar chase films
which tell the stories of two innocent men traveling
across the I Jnited States in search of the men for whom
they've been mistaken.
Casting
With his casting. Hitchcock initially draws the audi
ence's sympathy. Because the audience tends to care
about someone with whom they're familiar and com
fortable far more quickly than someone they know little
about, casting Cary ('.rant with his attractive charm and
Robert Cummings (in Saboteur) with his innocent
babyface as the films' heroes works perfectly.
Similarly. Hitchcock is meticulous with his villains.
He once said, "The more successful the villain, the more
successful the picture." Choosing them for the specific
effect they achieve, he incorporates in them his own
attitudes about superficial normality. On the surface, his
villains are suave, rich, and apparently harmless. Tobin
in Saboteur is witty and articulate rather than sneering
and despicable, while Vandamm in North by Northwest

is cultured and placid rather than venomous and rabid.
With an ironic script, too, Hitchcock creates an atmos
phere of terror for the audience by dropping the charac
ter with whom they identify into a circumstantial trap
that in turn, snares the audience. Roger Thornhill, the
hero played by Grant in North By Northwest, is a Madi
son Avenue advertising executive who accidentally, yet
with startling ease, becomes enmeshed in an espionage
struggle between the CIA and a ring of spies who, mis
taking his identity, kidnap him and try to kill him. Me
cause the spies are so adept at covering their tracks.
Thornhill can show the police no evidence of his abduc
tion, thus destroying his credibility with them. Trying to
discover the kidnappers' identities on his own, he only
finds himself more firmly mired in thequicksand of their
plot. Through no fault of his own — the most important
component in winningtheaudience's involvement — he
is now wanted for murder and unable to clear himself
without trying to discover who set him up and why.
Thoinhill's travels begin, leading him away from his
home in New York and into unfamiliar, and therefore
potentially dangerous, territory.

The predicament of Barry Kane, the hero played by
Cummings in Saboteur, is similar, though less compli
cated than Thornhill's. Kane, at least, was mistaken fora
man who actually exists, unlike Thornhill. After the
aircraft factory in which he works is sabotaged and his
best friend is killed. Kane comes under suspicion by the
police. Hv sheer chance, he knows the identity of the
actual perpetrator, something Thornhill did not. Be
cause Thornhill knows less than Kane, North By North
west is a far more suspenseful film, because the former is
Hying bli nd most of the time, working with the slimmest
of indirect leads. Kane gets almost everything he needs
to know literally dropped at his feet. As with Thornhill.
Hitchcock arouses sympathy for him by placing him
(handcuffed no less) in the custody of unsympathetic
law enforcement officers.
Police represent the symbols of authority and security
which are ironically warped in Hitchcock's films. Both
Kane and Thornhill are unable to enlist the aid of the
police because their predicaments are superficially pre
posterous to the uninformed. The audience, however,
thanks to Hitchcock's overriding concern for their in
volvement, is informed, and is consequently subjected to
the heroes' defeats along with them. It knows that even
though the situation appears normal on the surface, it is
actually permeated with evil. Hitchcock knows that his
audience is as instinctively fearful of the police as he is.
To increase their ominous presence, he portrays them as
cynical non-bel ievers who refuse to control the problems

which sprout before their eyes, even though they're paid
to do just that. The audience is terrified because even the
protesters of the law, those who are supposed to main :
tain order, are blind to the displacement of normality.
Seeing the ease with which Kane gets involved with Fry
and Thornhill is mistaken for Kaplan, the audience
wonders if it could happen to them. As easily as Thor
nhill becomes Vandamm's target, Hitchcock has con
verted the audience into fearful paranoids.
Travel
Separating North By Northwest and Saboteur from the
rest of Hitchcock's American films is the element of
travel through the cities and countrysides of America. A
chase keeps everyone on their toes, wondering where the
next step lies, while the scenery provides both familiar
and unfamiliar sites for the action, each having their own
purpose in the context of the fear Hitchcock wishes to
convey. In terms of familiarity, in both of these films
Hitchcock seems obsessed with national monuments
and tourist attractions, which heighten the audience's
involvement for twu reasons.
First, the chances are good that the audience has vis-

ited or at least seen photographs of the points of interest
in the films — the United Nations building, Mount
Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty, and Boulder Dam. Hav
ing been introduced to these monuments before, they
exist in the audience's consciousness as familiar, com
monly shared places. Due to their significance in Ameri
ca's history, they insinuate a bond between the viewer
and the structure. And the closer a person feels to the
location, the more affected he is by the action that takes
place there. This emotion fuses with the sympathy
Hitchcock has already aroused with his story of inno
cence on the run and his casting of familiar, vulnerable
personalities.
Secondly, just as the terror is heightened by the con
trast between the villains' superficial appearance and
their actual intentions, it is also increased when evil
encroaches the boundaries of typically sacrosanct
places. The Statue of Liberty, for instance, is considered
a symbol of life and freedom, rather than an instrument
of death as it is in Saboteur. The United Nations is
considered a bastion of diplomacy in which men gather
peaceably to settle their differences. When it becomes a
site of death and deceit, as it does in North By Northwest,
the effect startles. Mount Rushmore is a tribute to four
great men, and the invasion of Leonard and Valerian,
two little (in all senses of the word) men whose evil
contrasts greatly with the presidents, sullies it.
The monuments and tourist attractions are usually
envisioned as quiet, restful places, but when Hitchcock

enters upon the scene, dropping bodies, instigating fake
shootings and real stabbings, the audience is unable to
remain unaffected, as if the villains, by way of their
trespasses on the symbols of freedom represent an af
front to democracy. Invade what an audience considers
sacred and they'll despise the villain forever — which is
exactly what Hitchcock desires.
Hitchcock could have used skyscrapers or mountain
tops for the films' climaxes, but the effect on the audi
ence by using their own tourist attractions is far greater.
Thus Hitchcock utilizes the chase across America to
incorporate a higher level of involvement than one
normally finds in a chase movie.
Hitchcock employs the element of travel in unfamil
iar places, too, to create an opposite but equally devastat
ing effect in Saboteur and North By Northwest. Portions
of the films place t he heroes in unfamiliar surroundings,
as travel is likely to do to anyone. Finding oneself hunted
or searching for someone without knowing where to run
or whom to trust can be even more terrifying than any
situation in familiar territory. On the run as they are,
neither Thornhill nor Kane have the advantage of

explicit knowledge of their destination or their route, or
even what they're looking for, as in Soda City in
Saboteur and the deserted intersection in North By
Northwest. In both instances, the isolation is oddly un
real. In the former, an unpopulated ghost town with
ringing phones provides theeerieness. In the latter, there
is the unreality of a plane dusting non-existent crops.
The characters' unfamiliarity with the surroundings is
also conferred upon the audience, heightening the sus
pense. In addition, both the telephone and the plane
provide Hitchcock's favorite ploy — having the most
unexpected thing happen — once again to specifically
jolt the audience. Francois Truffaut said in an interview
with Hitchcock that since the scene in North By North
west didn't advance the action, it could only have been
created by a director.
Whether muddying the majesty of our national
monuments or setting the hero down in the middle of
nowhere, Hitchcock employs the vastness of the United
States in different ways in Saboteur and North By
Northwest to instill theemotion of terror in hisaudience.
He uses the arena of America as carefully as he chooses
his stories and hisactors. Each are specifically chosen for
a specific effect they will have on his audience so that
they will identify with the action from all aspects and be
unable to remain uninvolved with it. For the complete
involvement of hisaudienceis Hitchcock's highest goal.
