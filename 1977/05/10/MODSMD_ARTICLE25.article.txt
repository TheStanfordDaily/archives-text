Geneva, Switzerland — President Jimmy Car
ter had his third meeting with an Arab leader
since taking office and said yesterday night that
defense outposts for Israel beyond its legal boun
daries are "a possibility" in a Middle East settle
ment.
Carter's 3 1 /2-hour meeting here with Syrian
President Hafez Assad was "very informative
and very friendly," said the president's national
security adviser. Xbigjiiew Brzezinski.
The president, who is on hfs first trip abroad
sipce his election, previously met in Washington
with Jordan's King Hussein, Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and outgoing Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in a search for ways to end the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
Carter said after the Ceneva session tltat Assad
and the other leaders accept the concept of
peacekeeping forces along Israel's borders with
Arab countries.
• A Syrian government source in Damascus said
Assad also presented Carter yesterday with an
Arab consensus plan for creation of a Palestinian
state. But Adbib Daudi, an adviser traveling with
Assad, denied that such a proposal was made.
NATO deals with civil defense
London — President Jimmy Carter attends a
North Atlantic alliance summit meeting today
that will deal with a new topic — civil defense —
as well as the usual concerns of military strength
and coordination.
Joseph Luns, the Dutch secretary general of the
North Atfantic Treaty Organization (NATO) told

a news conference yesterday the Western allies
have been "disagreeably impressed' by the
Soviet Union's new program ol building bomb
shelters and otherwise bolstering defense of the
populace against nuclear attack.
The West has lagged behind in civil defense
preparations, Luns said.
Some NATO analysts find the Soviet civil de
fense program ominous. They speculate the
Kremlin might be emboldened in its dealings
with the West if it can guarantee a high survival
rate for its civilian population in the event ol
nuclear attack.
Strong civil defense might encourage the
Soviets to try a first nuclear strike, according to
this theory.
Panama Canal talks resume
Washington — Panama Canal treaty talks are
resuming here following sharp Panamanian
threats and accusations that the United States is
delaying a final accord.
Chief Panamanian negotiator Romulo Escobar
Betancourt and his team arrived here Sunday lor
talks with U.S. negotiators Sol Linowitz and
Ellsworth Bunker.
The new round of meetings will be held fol
lowing threatening talk from Panamanian
strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos.
In a Mexican news conference over the
weekend, Torrijos was quoted as warning that it a
new accord to replace the original canal treaty of
1903 is not completed, Americans in Panama
will be "without water, without lights, without a
canal and without gringos."
Keeping with what seems to be one of the most

secretive operations in American foreign policy,
U.S. officials had no comment. The Carter ad
ministration has steadfastly refused significant
comment on any aspect of the treaty talks.
The new round of talks is the 15th extension of
discussions stretching back to 1968.
Torrijos' major complaint deals with what he
sees as President Carter's lack of commitment to
completing the talks. "We have to have a defini
tion from the government of Mr. Carter during
this new round of negotiations," he said in
Mexico.
When asked what he expects from the new
talks, Torrijos expressed hope, but then voiced
his threat about isolating the Canal Zone.
U.S. stance on Bakke urged
Washington — The government should come
to the defense of a special school admissions
program benefitting blacks and other minorities,
the chairman of the Civil Service Commission
said yesterday.
The Supreme Court has the program under re
view.
"The dominant route to equality has to be
through education," commission chairman Alan
Keith Campbell said at a news conference.
A special admissions policy at the UC-Davis
Medical School was challenged by a white stu
dent who was turned down twice for entry to
medical school. The student, Allan Bakke,
claimed he would have been included in the
class if the school's admissions policy was not
maintained for minority students.
The California Supreme Court ruled last Oc
tober that the policy is unconstitutional.

Driver's license fees to rise
Sacramento — Driver's license fees would rise
from $:i.25 to $10 as part of an overhaul of trans
portation planning and funding in California
under ahi 11 approved by the Assembly yesterday.
The measure by Assemblyman Walter Ingalls
(D-Riverside), would greatly increase the legisla
ture's role in deciding how much money the state
spends to maintain and expand its huge highway
network.
Critics of the "legislative budgeting" provision
raised the specter of "pork barreling" — the age
old practice of trading political favors for state
funded projects in a legislator's district.
But the bill's progress so far is in part a sign of
discontent with the highway planning practices
of the Brown administration, accused by some
critics of deliberately understating resources and
going too slow on construction.
Ingalls' bill also would increase basic auto re
gistration fees from the current $11 by a dollar a
year for three years, and raise truckers' weight
fees by 40 per cent, or $40 million, over three
years.
It was sent to the Senate on a 41-25 Assembly
vote, but has a tough road ahead because of con
tinued opposition from the trucking industry as
well as Gov. Edmund Brown |r.'s Transportation
and Finance departments.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny and a little warmer today. Partly
cloudy tonight and tomorrow. Lows in the 40s to
low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 60s to

U.S. stance on Bakke urged
Washington — The government should come
to the defense of a special school admissions
program benefitting blacks and other minorities,
the chairman of the Civil Service Commission
said yesterday.
The Supreme Court has the program under re
view.
"The dominant route to equality has to be
through education," commission chairman Alan
Keith Campbell said at a news conference.
A special admissions policy at the UC-Davis
Medical School was challenged by a white stu
dent who was turned down twice for entry to
medical school. The student, Allan Bakke,
claimed he would have been included in the
class if the school's admissions policy was not
maintained for minority students.
The California Supreme Court ruled last Oc
tober that the policy is unconstitutional.

Driver's license fees to rise
Sacramento — Driver's license fees would rise
from $:i.25 to $10 as part of an overhaul of trans
portation planning and funding in California
under ahi 11 approved by the Assembly yesterday.
The measure by Assemblyman Walter Ingalls
(D-Riverside), would greatly increase the legisla
ture's role in deciding how much money the state
spends to maintain and expand its huge highway
network.
Critics of the "legislative budgeting" provision
raised the specter of "pork barreling" — the age
old practice of trading political favors for state
funded projects in a legislator's district.
But the bill's progress so far is in part a sign of
discontent with the highway planning practices
of the Brown administration, accused by some
critics of deliberately understating resources and
going too slow on construction.
Ingalls' bill also would increase basic auto re
gistration fees from the current $11 by a dollar a
year for three years, and raise truckers' weight
fees by 40 per cent, or $40 million, over three
years.
It was sent to the Senate on a 41-25 Assembly
vote, but has a tough road ahead because of con
tinued opposition from the trucking industry as
well as Gov. Edmund Brown |r.'s Transportation
and Finance departments.

Carter meets on Mid-East conflict
Geneva, Switzerland — President Jimmy Car
ter had his third meeting with an Arab leader
since taking office and said yesterday night that
defense outposts for Israel beyond its legal boun
daries are "a possibility" in a Middle East settle
ment.
Carter's 3 1 /2-hour meeting here with Syrian
President Hafez Assad was "very informative
and very friendly," said the president's national
security adviser. Xbigjiiew Brzezinski.
The president, who is on hfs first trip abroad
sipce his election, previously met in Washington
with Jordan's King Hussein, Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and outgoing Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in a search for ways to end the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
Carter said after the Ceneva session tltat Assad
and the other leaders accept the concept of
peacekeeping forces along Israel's borders with
Arab countries.
• A Syrian government source in Damascus said
Assad also presented Carter yesterday with an
Arab consensus plan for creation of a Palestinian
state. But Adbib Daudi, an adviser traveling with
Assad, denied that such a proposal was made.
NATO deals with civil defense
London — President Jimmy Carter attends a
North Atlantic alliance summit meeting today
that will deal with a new topic — civil defense —
as well as the usual concerns of military strength
and coordination.
Joseph Luns, the Dutch secretary general of the
North Atfantic Treaty Organization (NATO) told

a news conference yesterday the Western allies
have been "disagreeably impressed' by the
Soviet Union's new program ol building bomb
shelters and otherwise bolstering defense of the
populace against nuclear attack.
The West has lagged behind in civil defense
preparations, Luns said.
Some NATO analysts find the Soviet civil de
fense program ominous. They speculate the
Kremlin might be emboldened in its dealings
with the West if it can guarantee a high survival
rate for its civilian population in the event ol
nuclear attack.
Strong civil defense might encourage the
Soviets to try a first nuclear strike, according to
this theory.
Panama Canal talks resume
Washington — Panama Canal treaty talks are
resuming here following sharp Panamanian
threats and accusations that the United States is
delaying a final accord.
Chief Panamanian negotiator Romulo Escobar
Betancourt and his team arrived here Sunday lor
talks with U.S. negotiators Sol Linowitz and
Ellsworth Bunker.
The new round of meetings will be held fol
lowing threatening talk from Panamanian
strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos.
In a Mexican news conference over the
weekend, Torrijos was quoted as warning that it a
new accord to replace the original canal treaty of
1903 is not completed, Americans in Panama
will be "without water, without lights, without a
canal and without gringos."
Keeping with what seems to be one of the most

secretive operations in American foreign policy,
U.S. officials had no comment. The Carter ad
ministration has steadfastly refused significant
comment on any aspect of the treaty talks.
The new round of talks is the 15th extension of
discussions stretching back to 1968.
Torrijos' major complaint deals with what he
sees as President Carter's lack of commitment to
completing the talks. "We have to have a defini

this new round of negotiations," he said in
Mexico.
When asked what he expects from the new

• A Syrian government source in Damascus said
Assad also presented Carter yesterday with an
Arab consensus plan for creation of a Palestinian
state. But Adbib Daudi, an adviser traveling with
Assad, denied that such a proposal was made.
NATO deals with civil defense
London — President Jimmy Carter attends a
North Atlantic alliance summit meeting today
that will deal with a new topic — civil defense —
as well as the usual concerns of military strength
and coordination.
Joseph Luns, the Dutch secretary general of the
North Atfantic Treaty Organization (NATO) told

a news conference yesterday the Western allies
have been "disagreeably impressed' by the
Soviet Union's new program ol building bomb
shelters and otherwise bolstering defense of the
populace against nuclear attack.
The West has lagged behind in civil defense
preparations, Luns said.
Some NATO analysts find the Soviet civil de
fense program ominous. They speculate the
Kremlin might be emboldened in its dealings
with the West if it can guarantee a high survival
rate for its civilian population in the event ol
nuclear attack.
Strong civil defense might encourage the
Soviets to try a first nuclear strike, according to
this theory.
Panama Canal talks resume
Washington — Panama Canal treaty talks are
resuming here following sharp Panamanian
threats and accusations that the United States is
delaying a final accord.
Chief Panamanian negotiator Romulo Escobar
Betancourt and his team arrived here Sunday lor
talks with U.S. negotiators Sol Linowitz and
Ellsworth Bunker.
The new round of meetings will be held fol
lowing threatening talk from Panamanian
strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos.
In a Mexican news conference over the
weekend, Torrijos was quoted as warning that it a
new accord to replace the original canal treaty of
1903 is not completed, Americans in Panama
will be "without water, without lights, without a
canal and without gringos."
Keeping with what seems to be one of the most

secretive operations in American foreign policy,
U.S. officials had no comment. The Carter ad
ministration has steadfastly refused significant
comment on any aspect of the treaty talks.
The new round of talks is the 15th extension of
discussions stretching back to 1968.
Torrijos' major complaint deals with what he
sees as President Carter's lack of commitment to
completing the talks. "We have to have a defini
tion from the government of Mr. Carter during
this new round of negotiations," he said in
Mexico.
When asked what he expects from the new
talks, Torrijos expressed hope, but then voiced
his threat about isolating the Canal Zone.
U.S. stance on Bakke urged
Washington — The government should come
to the defense of a special school admissions
program benefitting blacks and other minorities,
the chairman of the Civil Service Commission
said yesterday.
The Supreme Court has the program under re
view.
"The dominant route to equality has to be
through education," commission chairman Alan
Keith Campbell said at a news conference.
A special admissions policy at the UC-Davis
Medical School was challenged by a white stu
dent who was turned down twice for entry to
medical school. The student, Allan Bakke,
claimed he would have been included in the
class if the school's admissions policy was not
maintained for minority students.
The California Supreme Court ruled last Oc
tober that the policy is unconstitutional.

Driver's license fees to rise
Sacramento — Driver's license fees would rise
from $:i.25 to $10 as part of an overhaul of trans
portation planning and funding in California
under ahi 11 approved by the Assembly yesterday.
The measure by Assemblyman Walter Ingalls
(D-Riverside), would greatly increase the legisla
ture's role in deciding how much money the state
spends to maintain and expand its huge highway
network.
Critics of the "legislative budgeting" provision
raised the specter of "pork barreling" — the age
old practice of trading political favors for state
funded projects in a legislator's district.
But the bill's progress so far is in part a sign of
discontent with the highway planning practices
of the Brown administration, accused by some
critics of deliberately understating resources and
going too slow on construction.
Ingalls' bill also would increase basic auto re
gistration fees from the current $11 by a dollar a
year for three years, and raise truckers' weight
fees by 40 per cent, or $40 million, over three
years.
It was sent to the Senate on a 41-25 Assembly
vote, but has a tough road ahead because of con
tinued opposition from the trucking industry as
well as Gov. Edmund Brown |r.'s Transportation
and Finance departments.
