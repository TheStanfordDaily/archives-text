Los Angeles (AP) â€” Patricia Hearst,
who admitted her part in a wild shoot
ing and robbery, was placed on five
years probation yesterday by a judge
who expressed compassion for her pa
rents.
The prosecution endorsed the light
sentence, saying the heiress rep
resented no threat to society and
suggesting that authorities may have
dealt too harshly with her in the past to
avoid criticism that her wealth bought
her special treatment.
Hearst, 23, is currently free on bail
from a seven-year sentence for a San
Francisco bank robbery and could re
turn to serve at least 14 more months if
her appeal is rejected.
Hearst, who faced the possibility of
15'/2 years to life in prison on her plea
of no contest, was silent and blank
faced as Superior Court judge E. Talbot
Callister announced his decision for
leniency.
After the sentencing the details of a
probation report were released.
In an unexpected move, the prosecu

tion joined with the defense in re
commending immediate probation for
Hearst.
In addition, Callister struck from the
court record two attached counts of
firearms use admitted by Hearst.
The judge said he considered her
willingness to testify against others in
granting probation. He also adopted a
position that Hearst is no longer a
threat to society.
Callister, a criminal judge for seven
years, said this was the most difficult
decision he had ever been asked to
make.
Among the factors which influenced
him, he said, was that "the defendant
was kidnaped and subject to 57 days of
horrible torture."
Should the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals reject Hearst's petition, she
would have to spend 14 months more
in jail before being eligible for proba
tion. Al Johnson, Hearst's attorney,
said he would appeal to the U.S. Sup
reme Court if necessary.
