il finally happened.
I've been writing these pieces
for four years, but only recently
in a letter to the editor was I first
hit with the classic epithet "reac
tionary conservative."
I suppose I've had it coming
tor some time now. One can only
challenge the conventions of
academic liberals for so long
without getting stigmatized as a
neanderthal.
The stated basis for my recent
lashing wasa bit unfair. Accused
of denigrating student protes
ters, I in fact had taken pains to
praise such activity, objecting
only to its occasional progres
sion to force. Pardon me, but I've
always thought doors were
blocked by thugs not liberals.
The conservative label was
probably attached to mefora his
tory of heresies, however.
Foremost among them, undoub
tedly, is my conviction that the
state should not rule over the
marketplace, which to the
academic liberal makes me a
lackey for powerful economic

interests.
Of course, there is a whole lit
erature asserting that it is the
state that fosters and maintains
arbitrary economic power.
It will suffice to say that the
trend is toward restriction of the
market and in fighting that
trend, we who recognize the
market as a mechanism for
change are typecast instead as
hidebound.
Or. as Nobel laureate F.A.
1 lavek put it in his essay. "Why 1
Am Not a Conservative,": "At a
time when most movements that
are thought to be progressive ad
vocate further encroachments on
individual liberty, those who
cherish freedom are likely to ex
pend their energies in opposi
tion."
For now, though, let us look at
a few positions that tend to belie
my conservative tag.
First of all, I challenge anyone

to point to a sentence I have writ
ten which advocates action "tor
the good of the nation" or relies
on any other variant of jingoism.
Nationalism is not fodder for in
tellectual argument (in fact it is
the foundation for fascism), yet,
as Hayek points out, it is a pow
erful lure for conservatives and
collectivists alike. This may exp
lain the widespread support for
President Jimmy Carter's energy
sacrifices.
Although 1 am grateful to be
living in the freest nation I know
of, 1 consider myself a citizen of
the world and not of any particu
lar country. I do not sing an
thems, salute flags or stand up
for courtroom judges. My rights
come from birth, not from a con
stitution. I will support legal in
stitutions insofar as they protect
those rights, and no further.
I am indebted again to Hayek
for a description of how
nationalist delusions of
superiority lead to imperialistic
imposition of one's own institu
tions on other "backward"
peoples. Conservatives aren't
alone here; note the actions of
that great progressive, Teddy
Roosevelt or more recently John
Kennedy.
An Internationalist phil
osophy must apply itself to
movement of people and goods,
and here again conservatives are
in the opposite camp. "Protect
American jobs," they say, by re
stricting imports and immigra
tion. I say erase national bound
aries — and that is exactly what
commerce would do if freed
from political shackles.
At the same time, let's erase
the lines of demarcation drawn
in our cities by zoning laws
which, like many conservation
laws, protect established wealth
by denying social mobility to
those without it.
Once again on the interna
tional level, 1 would dissent from
the largely conservative anti
disarmament lobby. Its views,
rooted in concepts of national
power which are hauntingly
Orwellian in their reliance on
the constant existence of an
enemy or threat, are coming back
into vogue in Washington. Sad.
In the area of social legisla
tion. conservatives are to be
found among those who have
created a high-priced illicit drug
market, with all its unpleasant
ramifications, by turning per

sonal distates into public law.
Soon the California legislature is
expected to ban homosexual
marriages — the institution ot
marriage itself being a legal arm
of religious beliefs.
Well, this could go on. My
point is that I (and more impor
tantly, people who think as I do)
believe in change. Unlike many
academic liberals, progressives
and collectivists, we don't insist
on change our way, but prefer to
open the door to whatever
change the free will of people
will bring — mindful only to
keep the door open for the con
tinuing change that will follow.
1 dread the term reactionary,
because 1 don't want to lose
those who are my natural allies.
Ouoting Hayek again: "In a
world where the chief need is
once more, as it was at the be
ginning of the 19th century, to
free the process of spontaneous
growth from the obstacles and
encumbrances that human folly
has erected, (our) hopes must
rest on persuading and gaining
the support of those who by dis
position are progressives,
those who. though they may be *
seeking change in the wrong di
rection, are at least willing to
examine critically the existing
and to change it wherever neces
sary."
