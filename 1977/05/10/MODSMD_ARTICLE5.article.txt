## Born again 
### 
I quite agree with the main
contention of Shannon Blando's
column (Daily. May 5): Anita
Bryant has no business persecut
ing homosexuals in the name of
(loci or anyone else. But I was
deeply offended by Blando's at
tack on "horn again" Christian
ity.
By connecting the "current
revival of'horn again' Christian
ity" to "a backlash against the
strides for social justice and
humanitarianism..." and "a re
juvenation ot all the prejudices
know to the human race."

Blando was displaying a typical
ignorance of the meaning of
being "born again." For a new
Christian, being born again
means the death of the former,
sinful self and a birth to a new
life in Christ. Blando doesn't
seem to even consider that any of
those claiming to be "born
again" might be si ncere; t his is a
sad oversight on her part be
cause those who are sincere will
be among the first to strive for
social justice and
bumanitarianism.
