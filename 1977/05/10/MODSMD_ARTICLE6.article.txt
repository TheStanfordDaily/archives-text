## Stanford deserves a D 
### 
Unfortunately, were I to give
grades to the quality of tlit; edu
cation I have received so far.
Stanford would be far from re
ceiving a high mark. In fact, it
would probably receive a I) or a
no-credit. There are several
major problems with education
that concern the direction and
purpose rather than the compo
nent parts of learning.
One major problem is the pace
of work. Education is a slow ab
sorptive process. It is a dynamic
process as well, so it must in
volve a good deal of change in
the way we perceive the uni
verse.
Unfortunately, the rapid pace
here seems to be an attempt to
keep up with the volume of
knowledge rather than the study
of the process and approaches
that are t he backbone of a field of
knowledge.
Another problem is the lack of
direction. Students do not know
where they are going. Even those
who have chosen a major and a
career for themselves are some
times dissatisfied by the lack of
direction of their education dur
ing their four year stay.
A student should attempt to
place himself in context with the
rest of the world. It seems that
too many are concerned only
with getting a job, building a
career and gaining contentment,
when perhaps they should give
more thought to understanding
their role and responsibilities in
society.
For some, philosophy is a de
nse. unpalatable topic that bears

little relation to the real world.
Yet it helps each individual, and
the human race, to consider the
question "What are we doing
here?" The human race has
never had a unity of purpose, a
well-defined set of goals or a
common direction, and yet it has
been thousands of years since
the first philosophers realized
that "I am aware."
Education should guide us in
making decisions about our own
life, but it must also make us
aware of the rest of humanity.
This lack of direction has its
causes, but one of its primary
causes is the rapidly increasing
volume of knowledge.
Specialists can barely keep up
with their own areas of speciali
zation let alone the rest of their
field, and developments in other
fields. Yet, in all probability, the
key to survival in the future will
be the ability to apply know
ledge from a wide variety of
fields.
In other words, Renaissance
men and women are needed. We
are now learning to look at the
universe in a broader sense. We

have begun to understand how
the components of the world in
terrelate; hence the key to solv
ing the problems of the world
will be in this ability to synth
esize truths from many discip
lines.
Interaction
All processes on this planet
are synergetic. They interact
with one another, complicating
the mechanisms of the problem,
and therefore the solution to the
problem. If we lack a view of the
whole, how can we possibly
hope to repair the parts?
The rapidly increasing vol
ume of knowledge poses another
problem as well: much of a stu
dent's life at Stanford revolves
around a mad dash to keep up
with the volume of knowledge.
There is too much studying,
and insufficient correlation to
"real-world" experiences. How
is the studpnt graduating from
college to deal with the trauma
of adjusting to the real world?
The transition from this some
what insulated oasis of learning
to the relentless indifference and
overwhelming size of the outside

world is one ol the major crises
in a person's life.
There is no balance to educa
tion: we undergo an intense
period of formal learning, fol
lowed by an intense period ol
working, when in fact both ph
ases are learning experiences. A
truly effective education would
integrate the "doing" phase with
the "learning" phase more
thoroughly.
College education is not just
preparation for lite, it is life, just
as the career is not the applica
tion of one's education, it is edu
cation.
Perhaps the most frightening
problem of education is implicit
in the phrase "higher educa
tion." A new Marxist variety
class struggle is emerging, but
the classes are not the proletariat
and the bourgeosie. They are the
intellectual elite and the unedu
cated.
Admittedly, there is no clear
distinction between these two
groups. The educational
background of humanity varies
across a continuum of sophisti
cation levels, from none at all. to

college degrees and beyond. Yet
no one can deny that govern
ment is more dependent now on
highly qualified specialists, the
I'hDs in economics, social sci
ence, natural science, psychol
ogy, than ever before.
The goal of education should
be to prevent this split not facili
tate it. Colleges are fostering an
intellectual elite when they
should be opening the minds of
their students to the needs of
others and the broader, interdis
ciplinary view of knowledge.
They should attempt to de
lineate the limits and the limita
tions of human knowledge, and
to understand events and pro
cesses in context with other as
pects of the world, and not as
something isolated.
Not much to do
There is not much a Stanford
student can do to alleviate such
monolithic problems; to begin
with, one could he aware of the
problem. A better understanding
of the problem could go a long
way in outlining future courses
of action; to this end. SCIRE is
now forming a task force to st udv
the goals of education, and the
interdisciplinary approach to
knowledge.
Those members of the Stan
ford community who are suffi
ciently interested in these prob
lems to work on the task force
next year are invited to attend a
May 12 formative meeting.

causes, but one of its primary
causes is the rapidly increasing
volume of knowledge.
Specialists can barely keep up

Interaction
All processes on this planet
are synergetic. They interact
with one another, complicating
the mechanisms of the problem,
and therefore the solution to the
problem. If we lack a view of the
whole, how can we possibly
hope to repair the parts?
The rapidly increasing vol
ume of knowledge poses another
problem as well: much of a stu
dent's life at Stanford revolves
around a mad dash to keep up
with the volume of knowledge.
There is too much studying,
and insufficient correlation to
"real-world" experiences. How
is the studpnt graduating from
college to deal with the trauma
of adjusting to the real world?
The transition from this some
what insulated oasis of learning
to the relentless indifference and
overwhelming size of the outside

world is one ol the major crises
in a person's life.
There is no balance to educa
tion: we undergo an intense
period of formal learning, fol
lowed by an intense period ol
working, when in fact both ph
ases are learning experiences. A
truly effective education would
integrate the "doing" phase with
the "learning" phase more
thoroughly.
College education is not just
preparation for lite, it is life, just
as the career is not the applica
tion of one's education, it is edu
cation.
Perhaps the most frightening
problem of education is implicit
in the phrase "higher educa
tion." A new Marxist variety
class struggle is emerging, but
the classes are not the proletariat
and the bourgeosie. They are the
intellectual elite and the unedu
cated.
Admittedly, there is no clear
distinction between these two
groups. The educational
background of humanity varies
across a continuum of sophisti
cation levels, from none at all. to

college degrees and beyond. Yet
no one can deny that govern
ment is more dependent now on
highly qualified specialists, the
I'hDs in economics, social sci
ence, natural science, psychol
ogy, than ever before.
The goal of education should
be to prevent this split not facili
tate it. Colleges are fostering an
intellectual elite when they
should be opening the minds of
their students to the needs of
others and the broader, interdis
ciplinary view of knowledge.
They should attempt to de
lineate the limits and the limita
tions of human knowledge, and
to understand events and pro
cesses in context with other as
pects of the world, and not as
something isolated.
Not much to do
There is not much a Stanford
student can do to alleviate such
monolithic problems; to begin

problem. A better understanding
of the problem could go a long
way in outlining future courses
of action; to this end. SCIRE is
now forming a task force to st udv
the goals of education, and the
interdisciplinary approach to
knowledge.

would probably receive a I) or a
no-credit. There are several
major problems with education
that concern the direction and
purpose rather than the compo

One major problem is the pace
of work. Education is a slow ab
sorptive process. It is a dynamic
process as well, so it must in
volve a good deal of change in
the way we perceive the uni
verse.
Unfortunately, the rapid pace
here seems to be an attempt to
keep up with the volume of
knowledge rather than the study
of the process and approaches
that are t he backbone of a field of
knowledge.
Another problem is the lack of
direction. Students do not know
where they are going. Even those
who have chosen a major and a
career for themselves are some
times dissatisfied by the lack of
direction of their education dur
ing their four year stay.
A student should attempt to
place himself in context with the
rest of the world. It seems that
too many are concerned only
with getting a job, building a
career and gaining contentment,
when perhaps they should give
more thought to understanding
their role and responsibilities in
society.
For some, philosophy is a de
nse. unpalatable topic that bears

little relation to the real world.
Yet it helps each individual, and
the human race, to consider the
question "What are we doing
here?" The human race has
never had a unity of purpose, a
well-defined set of goals or a
common direction, and yet it has
been thousands of years since
the first philosophers realized
that "I am aware."
Education should guide us in
making decisions about our own
life, but it must also make us

Perhaps the most frightening
problem of education is implicit
in the phrase "higher educa

class struggle is emerging, but
the classes are not the proletariat

Admittedly, there is no clear
distinction between these two
groups. The educational
background of humanity varies
across a continuum of sophisti

college degrees and beyond. Yet
no one can deny that govern
ment is more dependent now on
highly qualified specialists, the
I'hDs in economics, social sci

The goal of education should
be to prevent this split not facili
tate it. Colleges are fostering an
intellectual elite when they
should be opening the minds of
their students to the needs of
others and the broader, interdis

They should attempt to de

to understand events and pro

something isolated.
Not much to do
There is not much a Stanford
student can do to alleviate such
monolithic problems; to begin
with, one could he aware of the
problem. A better understanding
of the problem could go a long
way in outlining future courses
of action; to this end. SCIRE is
now forming a task force to st udv
the goals of education, and the
interdisciplinary approach to
knowledge.
Those members of the Stan
ford community who are suffi
ciently interested in these prob
lems to work on the task force
next year are invited to attend a
May 12 formative meeting.

Problems include rapid work pace,
lack of vocational direction, flood of
knowledge, no balance between
'learning,' 'doing'
Unfortunately, were I to give
grades to the quality of tlit; edu
cation I have received so far.
Stanford would be far from re
ceiving a high mark. In fact, it
would probably receive a I) or a
no-credit. There are several
major problems with education
that concern the direction and
purpose rather than the compo
nent parts of learning.
One major problem is the pace
of work. Education is a slow ab
sorptive process. It is a dynamic
process as well, so it must in
volve a good deal of change in
the way we perceive the uni
verse.
Unfortunately, the rapid pace
here seems to be an attempt to
keep up with the volume of
knowledge rather than the study
of the process and approaches
that are t he backbone of a field of
knowledge.
Another problem is the lack of
direction. Students do not know
where they are going. Even those
who have chosen a major and a
career for themselves are some
times dissatisfied by the lack of
direction of their education dur
ing their four year stay.
A student should attempt to
place himself in context with the
rest of the world. It seems that
too many are concerned only
with getting a job, building a
career and gaining contentment,
when perhaps they should give
more thought to understanding
their role and responsibilities in
society.
For some, philosophy is a de
nse. unpalatable topic that bears

little relation to the real world.
Yet it helps each individual, and
the human race, to consider the
question "What are we doing
here?" The human race has
never had a unity of purpose, a
well-defined set of goals or a
common direction, and yet it has
been thousands of years since
the first philosophers realized
that "I am aware."
Education should guide us in
making decisions about our own
life, but it must also make us
aware of the rest of humanity.
This lack of direction has its
causes, but one of its primary
causes is the rapidly increasing
volume of knowledge.
Specialists can barely keep up
with their own areas of speciali
zation let alone the rest of their
field, and developments in other
fields. Yet, in all probability, the
key to survival in the future will
be the ability to apply know
ledge from a wide variety of
fields.
In other words, Renaissance
men and women are needed. We
are now learning to look at the
universe in a broader sense. We

have begun to understand how
the components of the world in
terrelate; hence the key to solv
ing the problems of the world
will be in this ability to synth
esize truths from many discip
lines.
Interaction
All processes on this planet
are synergetic. They interact
with one another, complicating
the mechanisms of the problem,
and therefore the solution to the
problem. If we lack a view of the
whole, how can we possibly
hope to repair the parts?
The rapidly increasing vol
ume of knowledge poses another
problem as well: much of a stu
dent's life at Stanford revolves
around a mad dash to keep up
with the volume of knowledge.
There is too much studying,
and insufficient correlation to
"real-world" experiences. How
is the studpnt graduating from
college to deal with the trauma
of adjusting to the real world?
The transition from this some
what insulated oasis of learning
to the relentless indifference and
overwhelming size of the outside

world is one ol the major crises
in a person's life.
There is no balance to educa
tion: we undergo an intense
period of formal learning, fol
lowed by an intense period ol
working, when in fact both ph
ases are learning experiences. A
truly effective education would
integrate the "doing" phase with
the "learning" phase more
thoroughly.
College education is not just
preparation for lite, it is life, just
as the career is not the applica
tion of one's education, it is edu
cation.
Perhaps the most frightening
problem of education is implicit
