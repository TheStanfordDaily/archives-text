## Opinions Lessons on becoming a world dictator

Rob Docters

Recently I came across a strik
ing article, "British survey finds
few want to be rich."
It went on to say that". . .most
(Britons are) largely unamibiti
ous; they do not want or (sic.)
expect a great deal of money, and
even if they could get it, the vast
majority do not seem to be pre
pared to work harder for it . . .
the majority . . . questioned
thought they should work only
as much as needed to have a
pleasant life."
It seems to me that these find
ings, while perhaps more ex-
than one might find in the
Uniled States, still have great re
levance to the situation at this
and other campuses.
This kind of drift toward com
placency and death of the
pioneer spirit cherished by con
servatives and rustics has accel
erated in the past 40 years; this is
unfortunate.
Ambitions gone
Specificallly I would like to
complain about what 1 see as the
death of great ambitions; second,
1 suggest that this has some nega
tive societal and individual con
sequences.
Given Stanford's vast amounts
of budding young doctors,
lawyers, businessmen and
politicians a conventional ob
server might step back in awe
and exclaim, "Ah, here we have
the next generation of leaders."
It seems to me I've heard that
on a couple of occasions. People
being gazed at in respectful ex
pectation think about how

someday they will or rather may
live in a $:U)(),<)()<) home, drive a
Jaguar to work and be the head ol
some department or ottice with
at least a dozen clones beneath
them. Remember as a child
wanting to become something?
As a child 1 remember wanting to
be one of several things; a sea
captain, a ditch iligger or presi
dent of the U.S. . . . actually after
thinking about it, I wouldn't
mind becoming president ot
anywhere. After further thought
1 would actually probably get
frustrated with being'a U.S.-type
president so being a dictator
(benevolent, and enlightened of
course) seems to be preferable.
I might add the bigger the
country I'm dictator of the better.
1 am also an (eventual) inter
nationalist so to carry this to its
logical conclusion, it seems I'm
doomed to become dictator ol
the world (as soon as possible).
Anyhow, besides becoming
dictator ol the world 1 would also
like to become very wealthy. It
seems only appropriate that I be
come the world's wealthiest per
son.
At this point the reader (you)
has of course reached the con
clusion that I must (certainly) be
jesting. Actually I'm not (sort of).
Realistically I don't expect to
achieve both, or tor that matter,
either. Hut 1 do intend to try and
I'll bet I give myself a higher
(fractional) percentage chance of
achieving it than you do.
Consider the chores of being
dictator of the world, the

headaches and tribulations of
being constantly benevolent.
There would be a constant temp
tation to become a degenerate
tyrant. At first the temptation
would be small, perhaps some
small outrages on weekends.
Hut soon one's ambitions
would expand (that is the idea,
after all) and soon you might
enjoy sadistic displays of power,
the rape of a province or two.
The rape of a provincial or
two. Hut worst of all, even if you
remain a model dictator and do
only good and liberal things (ex
cept maybe, give away power)
there is one paramount problem:
what would your mother sav?
I think it isa shame that people
have become such unambitious,
conventional masses.
"But where would we be if
everyone wanted to become dic
tator of the world?" ask the petty
readers.
Dictator
In the first place. 1 don't think
it very likely that everyone will
wish to become Dictator of the
World (DOW). Anyhow, since 1
wish to become the single DOW
it would be most undesirable.
Also it would not be much of a
stride for individuality if
everyone desired it. Hut 1 would
like to see more people with that
desire. As a rule I believe com
petition, especially in politics, to
be a good thing.
What 1 do not like is little
groups interested in preserving
their own power, it results in
stagnant, perhaps corrupt gov-

ernment.
As a parallel you get (for brief
periods of time) cartels in busi
ness. Neither is to society's be
nefit. It should be clear that if
everyone wanted to rise above
the mere level of one of a group
of powerful politicians, or one of
a group of wealthy business
men, a much more energetic,
vibrant and flu id situation would
result.
This (ever so neatly J brings me
to the secondary point of this
column: that the rubbish about
classes is just that.
I would like to postulate that a
class conscious, class ordered
society is not a societal (or indi
vidual) optimum. Furthermore 1
would suggest that people se
eing themselves as likely to end
up in a particular class promotes
the structuring of society into
classes.
Finally I would maintain that
because people are no longer as
inclined or motivated to fight for
vast upward mobility they tend
to see themselves as more likely
to end up in a particular social
class.
The objection that comes to
most people's mind is of course
"Well, it's only realistic to as
sume that one will end up as a
member of some (self
determined) class, rather than as
dictator of the world." Well
perhaps.
Reasons
1 don't know about you. but I
personally dislike admitting
limitations of myself. I see no
reason why 1 shouldn't try to he
come DOYV.
I was only running over the
extreme cases. After my second
billion or fourth conquest of a
country perhaps I will lose in
terest in politics or business al
together (then again, perhaps
not).
Third, the situation today has
not always existed. Historically
any number of people consi
dered themselves dictator/king
of the world. And if they weren't
actually, that certainly did not

bother them.
On a more modest and recent
scale, any number of people
seem to be very happy as abso
lute rulers of their little bai
liwicks.
Concerning the parailel and
perhaps more relevant case of
wealth, somebody is simply
hound to be the richest man in
the world at all times.
1 see no reason why it couldn't
be me. On a reduced scale, while
government has drastically re
duced the amount of people who
become multi-millionaires in
any given year (in their clumsy,
ill-fated efforts to redistribute
income) over the last 30 years, it
seems to me still worth trying.
Put differently. I suggest
people become a lawyer or doc
tor if they enjoy it. However if
they want to do it for the money,
don't be petty. Few lawyers or
doctors are going to become
multi-millionaires in regular
practice; they are only likely to
become well-to-do, nothing
more.
No full coverage
Clearly in one Daily column
I'm not going to be able to coun
teract the governmental,
socialistic, folk propaganda that
its somehow evil to bo unreser
vedly ambitious.
Any number of folk tales of
how people with power and
wealth are really unhappy come
to mind. I only ask that you con
sider the possibility that unre
strained ambition might be
good, rather than bad.
Perhaps I simply have a grea
ter feeling of alientation in gen
eral, however I feel nothing in
common with any socio
economic class I am aware of.
Furthermore I do not see any
limit of power short of absolute,
nor wealth short of infinite that I
could not want more of. It seems
to me that in an almost logical
sense neither should you. Of
course expecting to attain those,
is on a different level of realism.

This kind of drift toward com

Ambitions gone
Specificallly I would like to
complain about what 1 see as the
death of great ambitions; second,
1 suggest that this has some nega
tive societal and individual con
sequences.
Given Stanford's vast amounts
of budding young doctors,
lawyers, businessmen and
politicians a conventional ob
server might step back in awe
and exclaim, "Ah, here we have
the next generation of leaders."
It seems to me I've heard that
on a couple of occasions. People
being gazed at in respectful ex
pectation think about how

someday they will or rather may
live in a $:U)(),<)()<) home, drive a
Jaguar to work and be the head ol
some department or ottice with
at least a dozen clones beneath
them. Remember as a child
wanting to become something?
As a child 1 remember wanting to
be one of several things; a sea
captain, a ditch iligger or presi
dent of the U.S. . . . actually after
thinking about it, I wouldn't
mind becoming president ot
anywhere. After further thought
1 would actually probably get
frustrated with being'a U.S.-type
president so being a dictator
(benevolent, and enlightened of
course) seems to be preferable.
I might add the bigger the
country I'm dictator of the better.
1 am also an (eventual) inter
nationalist so to carry this to its
logical conclusion, it seems I'm
doomed to become dictator ol
the world (as soon as possible).
Anyhow, besides becoming
dictator ol the world 1 would also
like to become very wealthy. It
seems only appropriate that I be
come the world's wealthiest per
son.
At this point the reader (you)
has of course reached the con
clusion that I must (certainly) be
jesting. Actually I'm not (sort of).
Realistically I don't expect to
achieve both, or tor that matter,
either. Hut 1 do intend to try and
I'll bet I give myself a higher
(fractional) percentage chance of
achieving it than you do.
Consider the chores of being
dictator of the world, the

headaches and tribulations of
being constantly benevolent.
There would be a constant temp
tation to become a degenerate
tyrant. At first the temptation
would be small, perhaps some
small outrages on weekends.
Hut soon one's ambitions
would expand (that is the idea,
after all) and soon you might
enjoy sadistic displays of power,
the rape of a province or two.
The rape of a provincial or

As a parallel you get (for brief

nefit. It should be clear that if
everyone wanted to rise above
the mere level of one of a group
of powerful politicians, or one of
a group of wealthy business
men, a much more energetic,
vibrant and flu id situation would
result.
This (ever so neatly J brings me
to the secondary point of this
column: that the rubbish about
classes is just that.
I would like to postulate that a
class conscious, class ordered
society is not a societal (or indi

Finally I would maintain that
because people are no longer as
inclined or motivated to fight for
vast upward mobility they tend
to see themselves as more likely
to end up in a particular social
class.
The objection that comes to
most people's mind is of course
"Well, it's only realistic to as
sume that one will end up as a
member of some (self

dictator of the world." Well
perhaps.
Reasons
1 don't know about you. but I
personally dislike admitting
limitations of myself. I see no
reason why 1 shouldn't try to he
come DOYV.
I was only running over the
extreme cases. After my second
billion or fourth conquest of a
country perhaps I will lose in
terest in politics or business al
together (then again, perhaps
not).
Third, the situation today has
not always existed. Historically
any number of people consi
dered themselves dictator/king
of the world. And if they weren't
actually, that certainly did not

bother them.
On a more modest and recent
scale, any number of people
seem to be very happy as abso
lute rulers of their little bai
liwicks.
Concerning the parailel and
perhaps more relevant case of
wealth, somebody is simply
hound to be the richest man in
the world at all times.
1 see no reason why it couldn't
be me. On a reduced scale, while
government has drastically re
duced the amount of people who
become multi-millionaires in
any given year (in their clumsy,
ill-fated efforts to redistribute

Reasons
1 don't know about you. but I
personally dislike admitting
limitations of myself. I see no
reason why 1 shouldn't try to he
come DOYV.
I was only running over the
extreme cases. After my second
billion or fourth conquest of a
country perhaps I will lose in
terest in politics or business al
together (then again, perhaps
not).
Third, the situation today has
not always existed. Historically
any number of people consi
dered themselves dictator/king
of the world. And if they weren't
actually, that certainly did not

bother them.
On a more modest and recent
scale, any number of people
seem to be very happy as abso
lute rulers of their little bai
liwicks.
Concerning the parailel and
perhaps more relevant case of
wealth, somebody is simply
hound to be the richest man in
the world at all times.
1 see no reason why it couldn't
be me. On a reduced scale, while
government has drastically re
duced the amount of people who
become multi-millionaires in
any given year (in their clumsy,
ill-fated efforts to redistribute
income) over the last 30 years, it
seems to me still worth trying.
Put differently. I suggest
people become a lawyer or doc
tor if they enjoy it. However if
they want to do it for the money,
don't be petty. Few lawyers or
doctors are going to become
multi-millionaires in regular
practice; they are only likely to
become well-to-do, nothing
more.

This kind of drift toward com

Ambitions gone
Specificallly I would like to
complain about what 1 see as the
death of great ambitions; second,
1 suggest that this has some nega
tive societal and individual con
sequences.
Given Stanford's vast amounts
of budding young doctors,
lawyers, businessmen and
politicians a conventional ob
server might step back in awe
and exclaim, "Ah, here we have
the next generation of leaders."
It seems to me I've heard that
on a couple of occasions. People
being gazed at in respectful ex
pectation think about how

someday they will or rather may
live in a $:U)(),<)()<) home, drive a
Jaguar to work and be the head ol
some department or ottice with
at least a dozen clones beneath

wanting to become something?
As a child 1 remember wanting to

anywhere. After further thought
1 would actually probably get
frustrated with being'a U.S.-type
president so being a dictator
(benevolent, and enlightened of
course) seems to be preferable.
I might add the bigger the
country I'm dictator of the better.
1 am also an (eventual) inter
nationalist so to carry this to its
logical conclusion, it seems I'm
doomed to become dictator ol
the world (as soon as possible).
Anyhow, besides becoming
dictator ol the world 1 would also
like to become very wealthy. It
seems only appropriate that I be
come the world's wealthiest per
son.
At this point the reader (you)
has of course reached the con
clusion that I must (certainly) be
jesting. Actually I'm not (sort of).
Realistically I don't expect to
achieve both, or tor that matter,
either. Hut 1 do intend to try and
I'll bet I give myself a higher
(fractional) percentage chance of
achieving it than you do.
Consider the chores of being
dictator of the world, the

headaches and tribulations of
being constantly benevolent.
There would be a constant temp
tation to become a degenerate
tyrant. At first the temptation
would be small, perhaps some
small outrages on weekends.
Hut soon one's ambitions
would expand (that is the idea,
after all) and soon you might
enjoy sadistic displays of power,
the rape of a province or two.
The rape of a provincial or

As a parallel you get (for brief

nefit. It should be clear that if
everyone wanted to rise above
the mere level of one of a group
of powerful politicians, or one of
a group of wealthy business
men, a much more energetic,
vibrant and flu id situation would
result.
This (ever so neatly J brings me
to the secondary point of this
column: that the rubbish about
classes is just that.
I would like to postulate that a
class conscious, class ordered
society is not a societal (or indi

would suggest that people se

Finally I would maintain that
because people are no longer as

vast upward mobility they tend
to see themselves as more likely
to end up in a particular social
class.

like to see more people with that
desire. As a rule I believe com
petition, especially in politics, to
be a good thing.
What 1 do not like is little
groups interested in preserving
their own power, it results in
stagnant, perhaps corrupt gov-

ernment.
As a parallel you get (for brief
periods of time) cartels in busi
ness. Neither is to society's be
nefit. It should be clear that if
everyone wanted to rise above
the mere level of one of a group
of powerful politicians, or one of
a group of wealthy business
men, a much more energetic,
vibrant and flu id situation would
result.
This (ever so neatly J brings me
to the secondary point of this
column: that the rubbish about
classes is just that.
I would like to postulate that a
class conscious, class ordered
society is not a societal (or indi
vidual) optimum. Furthermore 1
would suggest that people se
eing themselves as likely to end
up in a particular class promotes
the structuring of society into
classes.
Finally I would maintain that
because people are no longer as
inclined or motivated to fight for
vast upward mobility they tend
to see themselves as more likely
to end up in a particular social
class.
The objection that comes to
most people's mind is of course
"Well, it's only realistic to as
sume that one will end up as a
member of some (self
determined) class, rather than as
dictator of the world." Well
perhaps.
Reasons
1 don't know about you. but I
personally dislike admitting
limitations of myself. I see no
reason why 1 shouldn't try to he
come DOYV.
I was only running over the
extreme cases. After my second
billion or fourth conquest of a
country perhaps I will lose in
terest in politics or business al
together (then again, perhaps
not).
Third, the situation today has
not always existed. Historically
any number of people consi
dered themselves dictator/king
of the world. And if they weren't
actually, that certainly did not

bother them.
On a more modest and recent
scale, any number of people
seem to be very happy as abso
lute rulers of their little bai
liwicks.
Concerning the parailel and
perhaps more relevant case of
wealth, somebody is simply
hound to be the richest man in
the world at all times.
1 see no reason why it couldn't
be me. On a reduced scale, while
government has drastically re
duced the amount of people who
become multi-millionaires in
any given year (in their clumsy,
ill-fated efforts to redistribute
income) over the last 30 years, it
seems to me still worth trying.
Put differently. I suggest
people become a lawyer or doc
tor if they enjoy it. However if
they want to do it for the money,
don't be petty. Few lawyers or
doctors are going to become
multi-millionaires in regular
practice; they are only likely to
become well-to-do, nothing
more.
No full coverage
Clearly in one Daily column
I'm not going to be able to coun
teract the governmental,
socialistic, folk propaganda that
its somehow evil to bo unreser
vedly ambitious.
Any number of folk tales of
how people with power and
wealth are really unhappy come
to mind. I only ask that you con
sider the possibility that unre
strained ambition might be
good, rather than bad.
Perhaps I simply have a grea
ter feeling of alientation in gen
eral, however I feel nothing in
common with any socio
economic class I am aware of.
Furthermore I do not see any
limit of power short of absolute,
nor wealth short of infinite that I
could not want more of. It seems
to me that in an almost logical
sense neither should you. Of
course expecting to attain those,
is on a different level of realism.

Rob Docters

Recently I came across a strik
ing article, "British survey finds
few want to be rich."
It went on to say that". . .most
(Britons are) largely unamibiti
ous; they do not want or (sic.)
expect a great deal of money, and
even if they could get it, the vast
majority do not seem to be pre
pared to work harder for it . . .
the majority . . . questioned
thought they should work only
as much as needed to have a
pleasant life."
It seems to me that these find
ings, while perhaps more ex-
than one might find in the
Uniled States, still have great re
levance to the situation at this
and other campuses.
This kind of drift toward com
placency and death of the
pioneer spirit cherished by con
servatives and rustics has accel
erated in the past 40 years; this is
unfortunate.
Ambitions gone
Specificallly I would like to
complain about what 1 see as the
death of great ambitions; second,
1 suggest that this has some nega
tive societal and individual con
sequences.
Given Stanford's vast amounts
of budding young doctors,
lawyers, businessmen and
politicians a conventional ob
server might step back in awe
and exclaim, "Ah, here we have
the next generation of leaders."
It seems to me I've heard that
on a couple of occasions. People
being gazed at in respectful ex
pectation think about how

someday they will or rather may
live in a $:U)(),<)()<) home, drive a
Jaguar to work and be the head ol
some department or ottice with
at least a dozen clones beneath
them. Remember as a child
wanting to become something?
As a child 1 remember wanting to
be one of several things; a sea
captain, a ditch iligger or presi
dent of the U.S. . . . actually after
thinking about it, I wouldn't
mind becoming president ot
anywhere. After further thought
1 would actually probably get
frustrated with being'a U.S.-type
president so being a dictator
(benevolent, and enlightened of
course) seems to be preferable.
I might add the bigger the
country I'm dictator of the better.
1 am also an (eventual) inter
nationalist so to carry this to its
logical conclusion, it seems I'm
doomed to become dictator ol
the world (as soon as possible).
Anyhow, besides becoming
dictator ol the world 1 would also
like to become very wealthy. It
seems only appropriate that I be
come the world's wealthiest per
son.
At this point the reader (you)
has of course reached the con
clusion that I must (certainly) be
jesting. Actually I'm not (sort of).
Realistically I don't expect to
achieve both, or tor that matter,
either. Hut 1 do intend to try and
I'll bet I give myself a higher
(fractional) percentage chance of
achieving it than you do.
Consider the chores of being
dictator of the world, the

headaches and tribulations of
being constantly benevolent.
There would be a constant temp
tation to become a degenerate
tyrant. At first the temptation
would be small, perhaps some
small outrages on weekends.
Hut soon one's ambitions
would expand (that is the idea,
after all) and soon you might
enjoy sadistic displays of power,
the rape of a province or two.
The rape of a provincial or
two. Hut worst of all, even if you
remain a model dictator and do
only good and liberal things (ex
cept maybe, give away power)
there is one paramount problem:
what would your mother sav?
I think it isa shame that people
have become such unambitious,
conventional masses.
"But where would we be if
everyone wanted to become dic
tator of the world?" ask the petty
readers.
Dictator
In the first place. 1 don't think
it very likely that everyone will
wish to become Dictator of the
World (DOW). Anyhow, since 1
wish to become the single DOW
it would be most undesirable.
Also it would not be much of a
stride for individuality if
everyone desired it. Hut 1 would
like to see more people with that
desire. As a rule I believe com
petition, especially in politics, to
be a good thing.
What 1 do not like is little
groups interested in preserving
their own power, it results in
stagnant, perhaps corrupt gov-

ernment.
As a parallel you get (for brief
periods of time) cartels in busi
ness. Neither is to society's be
nefit. It should be clear that if
everyone wanted to rise above
the mere level of one of a group
of powerful politicians, or one of
a group of wealthy business
men, a much more energetic,
vibrant and flu id situation would
result.

class conscious, class ordered
society is not a societal (or indi
vidual) optimum. Furthermore 1
