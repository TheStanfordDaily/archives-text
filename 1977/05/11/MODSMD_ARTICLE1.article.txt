# A
						night in Milpitas
## 
### Mark Funk 
I have no criminal record. Or at
least I didn't until Monday night
when 1 was arrested along with 293
others for an "illegal" occupation of
Old Union. It was also the first
booking for the vast majority of
them.
The man at Elmwood Rehabilita
tion Facility said the charges will
go down on my record as PC6O2J,
407, 408, 409 and 416. To the
layman it means trespassing and
failure to disperse.
"This was the first one," said Bob
DeCrasse, a reporter - for the
Grapevine, as we made our way
back from processing in Milpitas.
"It didn't happen in Berkeley or
back East. South Africa is going to
be a nationwide issue and it started
here."
And he reasoned that, in a stroke,
Stanford had assumed the spiritual
leadership of the investment con
troversy.
After our release from Elmwood
Rehabilitation Center on our "own
recognizance," six of us got a ride to
Stanford. As we drove down High
way 17, we passed the Santa Clara
county sheriff's bus going to Mil
pitas with another load of protes
ters.
United left
"This will unite the left like it
hasn't been united for quite some
time," a companion observed. "It
used to be we'd walk around in
threes and think everybody else
here were fascists. Now we know
where people stand."
"It just goes to show," said De-
Crasse, "that Stanford people
think." ,
About seven hours earlier a
number of the demonstrators had
been doing some serious thinking.
The police were rumored to be out
side Old Union and it was time for
those inside to decide whether they
were going to face arrest or depart.
It would be a dishonest attempt at
psychoanalytic journalism to inter

pret what people's feelings were at
that point. I can only tell you what 1
was thinking.
The demonstration was called,
ostensibly, to protest Stanford's in
vestment in corporations which
have holdings in South Africa in
general. A four-point demand,
among other things, called on the
Board of Trustees to reverse its pre
vious abstentions on a Ford Motor
Company stockholder resolution
relating to apartheid.
The University owns 94,000
shares of Ford stock.
Questions
From 5 p.m. to the time the arrests
began, debates droned on. Would
we stay? Leave? Should we sign ci
tations? Go limp and let the police
carry us out?
My thoughts revolved around
three things: 1 wondered what
would happen to us if we were
taken into custody. Where would
they take us and would we have to
spend the night at the North County
Jail or Milpitas? What would hap
pen if, as appeared likely, we had to
go to court? Would they fine us?
Would the court date fall during the
summer? Or worse yet finals week?
More mindboggling was the pos
sibility that the University would
convene the Student Judicial Coun
cil to mete out punishment. For a
senior on the job market with one
month to go before graduation, the
prospect of suspension was most
unpalatable.
And then there was my
girlfriend. She was determined to
be arrested, but she also receives
financial aid from the University. I
didn't want her to risk losing that.
And her parents probably wouldn't
understand why she had partici
pated in the protest,much less allow
herself to be arrested.
Finally, there were the cops. De
cked out in full battle gear and tot
ing riot batons, they looked in
timidating. 1 did not want to give
them the opportunity to get in a lit

tie stick time at my expense.
In retrospect those fears might
seem shrill. But at 6:50 p.m., when
Chris Coleman, a member of the
Stanford Committee for a Respon
sible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
was led away, they had to be taken
into consideration. I was nervous.
Singing helped a little.
Arrested
Forty-eight minutes later 1 was
• under arrest. It had not been an easy
decision to make. Sgt. Marvin
Moore grabbed me by the shoulder
and said, "You're under arrest." Of
ficers took four of us back to a smal 1
anteroom where we were photo
graphed and slapped in "plastic."
They did not have enough hand
cuffs for 294 prisoners so the police
made do with plastic strips that got
tighter if you moved your hands too
much. The strips were not removed
in some cases for up to two-and-a
half hours, ample time for them to
cut off circulation and swell the
hands of some of the more unfortu
nate prisoners.
As they waited to take us through
the crowd to waiting buses and
vans, the cops talked about World
War 11. "Yea, I was with Mauldin (a
famous journalist) for the big one,"
a deputy informed us.
Outside we could see the swel
ling ranks of supporters. This was
heartening. Many people at
Elmwood said later that the crowd
which gathered outside made the
arrests worthwhile.
It was a strange experience for me
because for the first time, I was on
the other side of the cameras. I
wasn't taking the pictures — 1 was
the picture. Most of the photo
graphers were friends of mine so
my arrest was recorded for post
erity.
Mom will be pleased.
We waited in the vans for trans
portation to the Stanford police sta
tion. It took a long time for them to
fill up because initial processing in
the Old Union was slow. It would

get much slower at the police sta
tion.
'We Shall Overcome'
As we left we started singing. Be
fore we got to the station, freshman
fill Marshall had taught us a
number of new verses to "We Shall
Overcome."
The policemen kept us in a
meetingroom adjoining the Stan
ford fire station. Initially, they were
preprocessing people for transpor
tation to Milpitas there, but things
got so noisy, according to a deputy,
that they started taking us inside
the police station itself.
Preprocessing is a bureaucratic
nightmare. They took pictures

again. They wanted to know my
name, of birth, social security
number, current address, parents'
name ad infinitum. They even
asked for my religious preference.
This was to insure that if one of us
demanded Last Rights we could
have the clergy of our choice.
Each interview took about 15 mi
nutes, but there were only four
people taking information so a
backlog of protesters built up al
most immediately. First they tried
to cut down on time by not taking
personal items. Finally they gave
up and started sending everybody
directly to Elmwood for preproces
sing.

They just weren't prepared to
handle so many prisoners and
many of the deputies admitted as
much. We all thought this was
pretty funny.
In fact, camaraderie was develop
ing. If it hadn't been for those plas
tic strips, things would have been
just fine.
Some of the men (women were
processed more rapidly) were over
by the door talking with deputies.
DeGrasse said he had a bet with
Coleman that over 450 people
would be arrested. Bob lost.
Slowly, enough people filtered
out so our bus could start for Mil
