## Albers' artwork a costly eyesore 
### 
We, the undersigned, repre
sent students, staff and faculty of
the Departments of Physics,
Human Biology and Electrical
Engineering, and the Center for
Materials Research. On behalf of
these members of the University
community, we urge that Albers'
Wall not be erected on Lomita
Mall.
While the people we represent
hold a variety of opinions on the
esthetics of the wall itself, they
are unanimous in their apprecia
tion of the natural beauty of the
open grassy space of the mall
and the views across the mall in
all directions.
It is their overwhelming sen
timent that the artistic value of
the wall does not justify the de
struction of this open space.
We therefore urge in the

strongest possible terms that the
University administration re
verse its decision to place this
project on the Lomita Mall.

Once upon a time in the Land
of Leland there was a caustic
Emperor who devoted all his
daily efforts to making his king
dom look good, for only then
could he convince neighboring
kingdoms to contribute shekels
to make Leland look even better.
One day a great wiseman was
approached by the Emperor's
appointed shekel-grubbers and
asked to fork it over. Being a
wiseman, he instead gave them
plans for a wondrous wall made
of magic stone quarried from the

Dark Continent and shaped to
resonate with the universal
architecture-space of Leland by
oafs of the far-off Land of Pizza.
And thus it came to pass that
the magic stone was quarried
from the Black Mountain of the
Dark Continent amidst a great
flurry of shekels. Great
monoliths were strapped to the
backs of rare shekel-eating birds
and flown to Pizza, where, under
a great mound of shekels, the
secret runes were inscribed.
More shekels were thrown to the
birds and the power-laden,
rune-inscribed magic monoliths
were flown to the Land of Le
land. where, thanks to the
never-ending toil and gracious
generosity of the local labor un
ions, more shekels were spent in
the fabrication of the wall just so.

Lo! They got it just so perfect on
the fourth attempt (with shekel
and-a-half for overtime).
Now the Emperor was no or
dinary fool. This wondrous wall,
rune-inscribed, resonating with
the universal architecture-space
of the Land of Leland, was only
seen as a fantastic and valuable
thing of wonderment by the cul
tured, the rich, the tenured and
the soon-to-be-tenured.
The scum of the earth, even
students and staff and those who
would never be tenured (for they
are no lower than any other scum
of the earth) would see nothing
but an ugly dark wall destroying
the open spaces of Leland,
abolishing the games of frisbee
and leaving no place from which
to enjoy life.
Many years passed and the

wall was acclaimed by one and
all, except for the scum, as being
indeed wondrous, until, one
day, a little girl visiting Leland
with her mother looked upon the
wall and said:
"That is nothing but a dark,
ugly wall, and universal
architecture-space is a bunch of
Emperor's bullshit."
Wham! went Mom's hand ac
ross the impudent youngster's
face, freeing not a few of her
front teeth.
"Do you not know how many
shekels it cost!"
Moral: The only people who
are against the wall are those
who are unfit to judge it.
