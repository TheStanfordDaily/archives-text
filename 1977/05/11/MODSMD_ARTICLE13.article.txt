## Wright-Morrison defeat pros WTT's Gaters down Cards 
### Jeff Brandon 
Last Sunday in front of a
crowd of 1500 in Salinas, the
Cardinals dropped a 31-22 deci
sion to the Golden Gaters, the
Bay Area's World Tennis Team
(WTT) franchise.
In a tune-up match for mixed
play with USC, the Cards de
monstrated that they can play
with the pros. Although Stan
ford won only one match against
the Gaters, all but one match was
decided by a single service
break.
The men's singles match pit
ted Matt Mitchell against Tom
Okker, a netter ranked among
the top 10 players in the world at
times during the past several
years.
Mitchell came out gunning
and jumped to a 3-0 lead.
Good service
"I've never seen Matt serve so
hard," said teammate Diane
Morrison. "That's as tough as
I've seen him play."
Okker, however, capitalized
on a service break at 3-1 to turn
the match around and wind up
the winner, 6-4.
Serving for the set in the wo
men's singles match against
Betsy Nagelson, Susie Hagey
lost service and the match, 7-5.
In women's doubles, Gaters
Francoise Durr and Nagelson
pinned a 6-2 defeat on Stanford's
Barb Jordan and Nancy Rudd.
Cardinals Bill Maze and Perry
Wright lost the first 12 [joints in
the men's doubles match against
Okkerand Frew McMillan. Maze
and Wright do not regularly

team for doubles and received
only three minutes of warmup
before the match. Nonetheless,
after dropping the first three
games, the Cards played even
with the Cater duo, losing 6-3.
Wright, a winner
For the second straight year,
Wright was a winner against the
Gaters. A fine doubles player as
evidenced by his national
amateur doubles championship,
Wright teamed with national
collegiate doubles champion
Diane Morrison to defeat Durr
and John Holladay, 7-5.
Overall, the Cards looked im
pressive against one of the top
teams in the WTT.
Southern California, which
meets Stanford Saturday in
Maples Pavilion, should prove
to be a tough test for the Cards.
The Trojans feature the top
women's team in the nation and
the No. 2 ranked men's team.
The Cards will probably go
with a lineup identical to that
used against the Caters except
that Maze will play men's dou
bles with his regular partner,
John Rast.
The men and women were
both deterred by the weather this
week; the men's match with San
Jose State being rained out yes
terday and the women having to
cancel a match Monday with
UC-Davis because of the incle
ment weather.
Cardinal notes: Two outstand
ing high school tennis players
will enroll at Stanford this fall,

Card women's coach Anne Hill
announced recently, kathy Jor
dan and Donna Rubin, top
ranked in the Girls 16s last year,
will add depth to the depleted
women's team.
Jordan, sister of Stanford
sophomore All-America Barb
Jordan, was ranked fifth in the
USTA Girls 16s last year. A pro
duct of King of Prussia, Pa., she
played in national doubles com
petition with her sister.
Rubin, from Rye, N.Y., was
ninth in the 16s last year, also
was fifth in the 18 doubles.
Mixed matches
Sunday, Maples Madness re
turns to the Farm as the Cards'
men's and women's teams com
bine to meet top-ranked USC.
The matches, in which nine
Ail-Americans will compete,
will follow the World Team
Tennis (WTT) format of one set
each of men's and women's sing
les, doubles and mixed doubles.
Starting time is 7 p.m.
"We've been looking forward
to playing mixed matches again
since we met Trinity here last
year," said coach Dick Gould.
Last year Stanford beat Trinitv
10-8."
"The matches are a favorite of
the players and fans alike," he
said. "People enjoy watching the
kids play as much as the kids
enjoy playing."
Heading the Cards' line-up is
sophomore All-American Matt
Mitchell, the *77 National
Amateur Indoors and Ojai Inter
collegiate champ. "Mitch" will
face Trojan All-American Bruce

Manson, who is the No. 38
ranked amateur in the country.
Mitchell has lost to Manson
twice in three matchups this sea
son, but in the No. 1 Card's last
outing at Ojai he killed Manson,
6-2, 6-0.
The women's singles match
pits two more All-Americans —
sophomore Susie Hagie and the
Trojans' Barb Hallquist, the de
fending USTA collegiate champ.
Hagey beat Hallquist in straight
sets at 'SC last month.

Magic man
Netter Perry Wright, the national amateur doubles champion, shown here in singles competition,
teamed with Diane Morrison to defeat the Golden Gaters' mixed doubles team of John Holladay
and Francoise Durr, 7-5, Saturday in Salinas.
Last Sunday in front of a
crowd of 1500 in Salinas, the
Cardinals dropped a 31-22 deci
sion to the Golden Gaters, the
Bay Area's World Tennis Team
(WTT) franchise.
In a tune-up match for mixed
play with USC, the Cards de
monstrated that they can play
with the pros. Although Stan
ford won only one match against
the Gaters, all but one match was
decided by a single service
break.
The men's singles match pit
ted Matt Mitchell against Tom
Okker, a netter ranked among
the top 10 players in the world at
times during the past several
years.
Mitchell came out gunning
and jumped to a 3-0 lead.
Good service
"I've never seen Matt serve so
hard," said teammate Diane
Morrison. "That's as tough as
I've seen him play."
Okker, however, capitalized
on a service break at 3-1 to turn
the match around and wind up
the winner, 6-4.
Serving for the set in the wo
men's singles match against
Betsy Nagelson, Susie Hagey
lost service and the match, 7-5.
In women's doubles, Gaters
Francoise Durr and Nagelson
pinned a 6-2 defeat on Stanford's
Barb Jordan and Nancy Rudd.
Cardinals Bill Maze and Perry
Wright lost the first 12 [joints in
the men's doubles match against
Okkerand Frew McMillan. Maze
and Wright do not regularly

team for doubles and received
only three minutes of warmup
before the match. Nonetheless,
after dropping the first three
games, the Cards played even
with the Cater duo, losing 6-3.
Wright, a winner
For the second straight year,
Wright was a winner against the
Gaters. A fine doubles player as
evidenced by his national
amateur doubles championship,
Wright teamed with national
collegiate doubles champion
Diane Morrison to defeat Durr
and John Holladay, 7-5.
Overall, the Cards looked im
pressive against one of the top
teams in the WTT.
Southern California, which
meets Stanford Saturday in
Maples Pavilion, should prove
to be a tough test for the Cards.
The Trojans feature the top
women's team in the nation and
the No. 2 ranked men's team.
The Cards will probably go
with a lineup identical to that
used against the Caters except
that Maze will play men's dou
bles with his regular partner,
John Rast.
The men and women were
both deterred by the weather this
week; the men's match with San
Jose State being rained out yes
terday and the women having to
cancel a match Monday with
UC-Davis because of the incle
ment weather.
Cardinal notes: Two outstand
ing high school tennis players
will enroll at Stanford this fall,

Card women's coach Anne Hill
announced recently, kathy Jor
dan and Donna Rubin, top
ranked in the Girls 16s last year,
will add depth to the depleted
women's team.
Jordan, sister of Stanford
sophomore All-America Barb
Jordan, was ranked fifth in the
USTA Girls 16s last year. A pro
duct of King of Prussia, Pa., she
played in national doubles com
petition with her sister.
Rubin, from Rye, N.Y., was
ninth in the 16s last year, also
was fifth in the 18 doubles.

The matches, in which nine
Ail-Americans will compete,

each of men's and women's sing

"We've been looking forward

since we met Trinity here last

Magic man
Netter Perry Wright, the national amateur doubles champion, shown here in singles competition,
teamed with Diane Morrison to defeat the Golden Gaters' mixed doubles team of John Holladay
and Francoise Durr, 7-5, Saturday in Salinas.
Last Sunday in front of a
crowd of 1500 in Salinas, the
Cardinals dropped a 31-22 deci
sion to the Golden Gaters, the
Bay Area's World Tennis Team
(WTT) franchise.
In a tune-up match for mixed
play with USC, the Cards de
monstrated that they can play
with the pros. Although Stan
ford won only one match against
the Gaters, all but one match was
decided by a single service
break.
The men's singles match pit
ted Matt Mitchell against Tom
Okker, a netter ranked among
the top 10 players in the world at
times during the past several
years.
Mitchell came out gunning
and jumped to a 3-0 lead.
Good service
"I've never seen Matt serve so
hard," said teammate Diane
Morrison. "That's as tough as
I've seen him play."
Okker, however, capitalized
on a service break at 3-1 to turn
the match around and wind up
the winner, 6-4.
Serving for the set in the wo
men's singles match against
Betsy Nagelson, Susie Hagey
lost service and the match, 7-5.
In women's doubles, Gaters
Francoise Durr and Nagelson
pinned a 6-2 defeat on Stanford's
Barb Jordan and Nancy Rudd.
Cardinals Bill Maze and Perry
Wright lost the first 12 [joints in
the men's doubles match against
Okkerand Frew McMillan. Maze
and Wright do not regularly

team for doubles and received
only three minutes of warmup
before the match. Nonetheless,
after dropping the first three
games, the Cards played even
with the Cater duo, losing 6-3.
Wright, a winner
For the second straight year,
Wright was a winner against the
Gaters. A fine doubles player as
evidenced by his national
amateur doubles championship,
Wright teamed with national
collegiate doubles champion
Diane Morrison to defeat Durr
and John Holladay, 7-5.
Overall, the Cards looked im
pressive against one of the top
teams in the WTT.
Southern California, which
meets Stanford Saturday in
Maples Pavilion, should prove
to be a tough test for the Cards.
The Trojans feature the top
women's team in the nation and
the No. 2 ranked men's team.
The Cards will probably go
with a lineup identical to that
used against the Caters except
that Maze will play men's dou
bles with his regular partner,
John Rast.
The men and women were
both deterred by the weather this
week; the men's match with San
Jose State being rained out yes
