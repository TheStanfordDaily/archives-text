## Walsh gives Cards a face lift

Triple rights? Double slots?
Tight end in motion? Offensive
defense? What happened to the
good old off-tackJe drive?
Woody Hayes fans, do not fret.
New Stanford head football
coach Bill Walsh hasn't aban
doned all of the three yards and
a cloud of dust' plays.
What he has done, though, is
install an imaginative, wide
open style offense that the Car
dinals have been perfecting dur
ing the past four weeks of spring
football. And if you can't wait
until the Cardinals' Sept. 24
home opener to see this newest
show in town, you'd better hus
tle down to the final two spring
sessions today and Saturday.
While the new offensive
strategy is still predicated upon
the right arm of quarterback Guy
Benjamin and the forward pass,
the style of the aerial attack is
quite different from years past.
"We use people better," said

Benjamin. "We run better and
the passing game has more com
binations."
"Most of the patterns are
deeper," said Bill Kellar, the
Cards' top returning receiver,
and Benjamin's No. 1 target this
spring. "The tight ends are used
more," Kellar added.
For instance, in the past Car
dinal receivers broke one direc
tion or another at about 12 yards
downfield. Under Walsh and as
sistant Ron Dowhower the re
ceivers are instructed to take
their routes to the open areas of
the zone defense and have the
quarterback zero in on them in
these slots.
Anticipation
Usually this entails a 15- to
18-yard route before the break.
The success of such a flexible
system rests with the ability of
the receiver and the quarterback
to anticipate each other's moves.
The utilization of the tight end
is a lot more varied under
Walsh's system. The tight ends
"had more long patterns last
year," said Mark Hoaglin, a
6-foot-8 senior tight end.
This season, according to
Hoaglin, the tight ends will be
"used a lot in motion and that
kind of opens up the defense a
lot more. It spreads the zone de
fense out more and allows the
backs to slip underneath."
This is intended to give the
backs some running room after a
pass reception and hopefully
break off a big gainer. Hoaglin
said the patterns for the tight
ends involve "mostly hooking
over to the middle to control the
linebackers."
George Seifert, the Cards' de
fensive backfield coach, knows
the Stanford pass offense well
because his charges face Benja
min and his cohorts everyday in
practice.
Exploit zone seams
"The attacking of zones will
be a little unique," said Seifert.
According to Seifert, most pass
defenses are aimed at covering
four of the six underneath areas
in the defensive backfield. The
Cards' multiple offensive forma
tions and motions are designed
to exploit the two areas left with
minimal protection by the de
fense.
Walsh has incorporated flexi
bility, not only into the passing
game, but also into the ground
attack. "The plays are designed
to isolate the running back on
someone he can defeat," said

running back Billy Anderson.
"The offense is more suited to
the kinds of backs we have."
Left tackle Gordon King, a
third-year starter, said, "As a
whole offensive team, vye're
quicker off the ball." To
maximize this quickness, some
of the running plays employ a
"key block" in which the line
man can block his opponent
either way, with the ball carrier
cutting to the open hole.
Center Dan McCann said this
strategy offers "a lot more ver
satility in the ground attack."
The Cardinal defense is based on
a strategy unusual to college
ball. There will not be "drastic
changes in pass coverage and
basic fronts," said Seifert, but
the defense will be "more con
scious of the down and distance
situation."
Limit first down gains
Seifert added that the Cards
will try to limit the opposition's
gains on first down, thereby dic
tating the type of plays available
to the offense on later downs.
This style of defense, according
to Seifert, is frequently found in
pro football.
The Stanford defense will fea
ture some other elements not
common to college football. For
instance, the Cards' four-three
alignment will include four
man, odd-man line. This defense

positions a lineman over the
center and is designed to hamper
the blocking assignments of the
offensive linemen.
Although linebacker coach
Norb Hecker warned that the
Cards do not seem to have a lot of
depth on defense, "We have a lot
of young guys who want to hit."
Secondary strengthened
The defensive secondary, led
by returning strong safety starter
Ralph Phillips, has pleased
Walsh so far. Cornerbacks John
Pigott and Savann Thompson
were singled out by Walsh.
"Pigott has been very impressive
and we've seen real improve
ment in Thompson," said
Walsh.
One reason for the improve
ment in the backfield is Seifert.
Before leaving for a two-year
stint as Cornell's head coach,
Seifert produced top defensive
backfield corps for Stanford.
Walsh also praised the work of
the defensive line, which has
been exhorted throughout the
spring by its loquacious coach,
Fred von Appen. "The coaches
feel we've made significant
progress on the defensive line,"
said Walsh.
Despite the improvement of
the defense, the offense usually
controls the scrimmages — just
as Walsh hopes it will control
Colorado and Tulane and. . . .

6-foot-8 senior tight end.
This season, according to
Hoaglin, the tight ends will be
"used a lot in motion and that
kind of opens up the defense a
lot more. It spreads the zone de
fense out more and allows the
backs to slip underneath."
This is intended to give the
backs some running room after a
pass reception and hopefully
break off a big gainer. Hoaglin
said the patterns for the tight
ends involve "mostly hooking
over to the middle to control the
linebackers."
George Seifert, the Cards' de
fensive backfield coach, knows
the Stanford pass offense well
because his charges face Benja
min and his cohorts everyday in
practice.
Exploit zone seams
"The attacking of zones will
be a little unique," said Seifert.
According to Seifert, most pass
defenses are aimed at covering
four of the six underneath areas
in the defensive backfield. The
Cards' multiple offensive forma
tions and motions are designed
to exploit the two areas left with
minimal protection by the de
fense.
Walsh has incorporated flexi
bility, not only into the passing
game, but also into the ground
attack. "The plays are designed
to isolate the running back on
someone he can defeat," said

running back Billy Anderson.
"The offense is more suited to
the kinds of backs we have."
Left tackle Gordon King, a
third-year starter, said, "As a
whole offensive team, vye're
quicker off the ball." To
maximize this quickness, some
of the running plays employ a
"key block" in which the line
man can block his opponent
either way, with the ball carrier
cutting to the open hole.
Center Dan McCann said this
strategy offers "a lot more ver
satility in the ground attack."
The Cardinal defense is based on
a strategy unusual to college
ball. There will not be "drastic
changes in pass coverage and
basic fronts," said Seifert, but
the defense will be "more con
scious of the down and distance
situation."
Limit first down gains
Seifert added that the Cards
will try to limit the opposition's
gains on first down, thereby dic
tating the type of plays available
to the offense on later downs.
This style of defense, according
to Seifert, is frequently found in
pro football.
The Stanford defense will fea
ture some other elements not
common to college football. For
instance, the Cards' four-three
alignment will include four
man, odd-man line. This defense

positions a lineman over the
center and is designed to hamper
the blocking assignments of the
offensive linemen.
Although linebacker coach
Norb Hecker warned that the
Cards do not seem to have a lot of
depth on defense, "We have a lot
of young guys who want to hit."
Secondary strengthened
The defensive secondary, led
by returning strong safety starter
Ralph Phillips, has pleased
Walsh so far. Cornerbacks John
Pigott and Savann Thompson
were singled out by Walsh.
"Pigott has been very impressive
and we've seen real improve
ment in Thompson," said
Walsh.
One reason for the improve
ment in the backfield is Seifert.
Before leaving for a two-year
stint as Cornell's head coach,
Seifert produced top defensive
backfield corps for Stanford.
Walsh also praised the work of
the defensive line, which has
been exhorted throughout the
spring by its loquacious coach,
Fred von Appen. "The coaches
feel we've made significant
progress on the defensive line,"
said Walsh.
Despite the improvement of
the defense, the offense usually
controls the scrimmages — just
as Walsh hopes it will control
Colorado and Tulane and. . . .

drill. Saturday marks the end of Stanford's spring workouts with
an intersquad game at 9:30 a.m. on the football practice field
behind Maples Pavilion.
Triple rights? Double slots?
Tight end in motion? Offensive
defense? What happened to the
good old off-tackJe drive?
Woody Hayes fans, do not fret.
New Stanford head football
coach Bill Walsh hasn't aban
doned all of the three yards and
a cloud of dust' plays.
What he has done, though, is
install an imaginative, wide
open style offense that the Car
dinals have been perfecting dur
ing the past four weeks of spring
football. And if you can't wait
until the Cardinals' Sept. 24
home opener to see this newest
show in town, you'd better hus
tle down to the final two spring
sessions today and Saturday.
While the new offensive
strategy is still predicated upon
the right arm of quarterback Guy
Benjamin and the forward pass,
the style of the aerial attack is
quite different from years past.
"We use people better," said

Benjamin. "We run better and
the passing game has more com
binations."
"Most of the patterns are
deeper," said Bill Kellar, the
Cards' top returning receiver,
and Benjamin's No. 1 target this
spring. "The tight ends are used
more," Kellar added.
For instance, in the past Car
dinal receivers broke one direc
tion or another at about 12 yards
downfield. Under Walsh and as
sistant Ron Dowhower the re
ceivers are instructed to take
their routes to the open areas of
the zone defense and have the
quarterback zero in on them in
these slots.
Anticipation
Usually this entails a 15- to
18-yard route before the break.
The success of such a flexible
system rests with the ability of
the receiver and the quarterback
to anticipate each other's moves.
The utilization of the tight end
is a lot more varied under

the defense will be "more con

situation."

Seifert added that the Cards
will try to limit the opposition's
gains on first down, thereby dic

to the offense on later downs.
This style of defense, according
to Seifert, is frequently found in
pro football.
The Stanford defense will fea
ture some other elements not
common to college football. For

alignment will include four
man, odd-man line. This defense

positions a lineman over the
center and is designed to hamper
the blocking assignments of the
offensive linemen.
Although linebacker coach
Norb Hecker warned that the
Cards do not seem to have a lot of
depth on defense, "We have a lot
of young guys who want to hit."
Secondary strengthened
The defensive secondary, led
by returning strong safety starter
Ralph Phillips, has pleased
Walsh so far. Cornerbacks John
Pigott and Savann Thompson
were singled out by Walsh.
"Pigott has been very impressive
and we've seen real improve

Walsh.
One reason for the improve

Before leaving for a two-year
stint as Cornell's head coach,
Seifert produced top defensive
backfield corps for Stanford.
Walsh also praised the work of
the defensive line, which has
been exhorted throughout the
spring by its loquacious coach,
Fred von Appen. "The coaches

Busting through
Card junior back John Finley runs the ball in a spring practice
drill. Saturday marks the end of Stanford's spring workouts with
an intersquad game at 9:30 a.m. on the football practice field
behind Maples Pavilion.
Triple rights? Double slots?
Tight end in motion? Offensive
defense? What happened to the
good old off-tackJe drive?
Woody Hayes fans, do not fret.
New Stanford head football
coach Bill Walsh hasn't aban
doned all of the three yards and
a cloud of dust' plays.
What he has done, though, is
install an imaginative, wide
open style offense that the Car
dinals have been perfecting dur
ing the past four weeks of spring
football. And if you can't wait
until the Cardinals' Sept. 24
home opener to see this newest
show in town, you'd better hus
tle down to the final two spring
sessions today and Saturday.
While the new offensive
strategy is still predicated upon
the right arm of quarterback Guy
Benjamin and the forward pass,
the style of the aerial attack is
quite different from years past.
"We use people better," said

Benjamin. "We run better and
the passing game has more com
binations."
"Most of the patterns are
deeper," said Bill Kellar, the
Cards' top returning receiver,
and Benjamin's No. 1 target this
spring. "The tight ends are used
more," Kellar added.
For instance, in the past Car
dinal receivers broke one direc
tion or another at about 12 yards
downfield. Under Walsh and as
sistant Ron Dowhower the re
ceivers are instructed to take
their routes to the open areas of
the zone defense and have the
quarterback zero in on them in
these slots.
Anticipation
Usually this entails a 15- to
18-yard route before the break.
The success of such a flexible
system rests with the ability of
the receiver and the quarterback
to anticipate each other's moves.
The utilization of the tight end
is a lot more varied under
Walsh's system. The tight ends
"had more long patterns last
year," said Mark Hoaglin, a
6-foot-8 senior tight end.
This season, according to
Hoaglin, the tight ends will be
"used a lot in motion and that
kind of opens up the defense a
lot more. It spreads the zone de
fense out more and allows the
backs to slip underneath."
This is intended to give the
backs some running room after a
pass reception and hopefully
break off a big gainer. Hoaglin
said the patterns for the tight
ends involve "mostly hooking
over to the middle to control the
linebackers."
George Seifert, the Cards' de
fensive backfield coach, knows
the Stanford pass offense well
because his charges face Benja
min and his cohorts everyday in
practice.
Exploit zone seams
"The attacking of zones will
be a little unique," said Seifert.
According to Seifert, most pass
defenses are aimed at covering
four of the six underneath areas
in the defensive backfield. The
Cards' multiple offensive forma
tions and motions are designed
to exploit the two areas left with
minimal protection by the de
fense.
Walsh has incorporated flexi
bility, not only into the passing
game, but also into the ground
attack. "The plays are designed
to isolate the running back on
someone he can defeat," said

running back Billy Anderson.
"The offense is more suited to
the kinds of backs we have."
Left tackle Gordon King, a
third-year starter, said, "As a
whole offensive team, vye're
quicker off the ball." To
maximize this quickness, some
of the running plays employ a
"key block" in which the line
man can block his opponent
either way, with the ball carrier
cutting to the open hole.
Center Dan McCann said this
strategy offers "a lot more ver
satility in the ground attack."
The Cardinal defense is based on
a strategy unusual to college
ball. There will not be "drastic
changes in pass coverage and
basic fronts," said Seifert, but
the defense will be "more con
scious of the down and distance
situation."
Limit first down gains
Seifert added that the Cards
will try to limit the opposition's
gains on first down, thereby dic
tating the type of plays available
to the offense on later downs.
