## 
### 
More than 10,000 Bay Area
running enthusiasts are ex
pected to congregate at the bot
tom of Howard Street in San
Francisco Sunday for the annual
Bay-to-Breakers road run.
The 7.6-mile foot race yearly
attracts more participants than
any single sporting event in the
United States. With close to 8800
official entrants and several
thousand runners expected to
compete unofficially, the race
dwarves other running specta
cles such as the Boston
Marathon.
The race begins at 10 a.m. at
the foot of Howard Street bet
ween Spear and Main. After
padding up Howard and across
Ninth Street runners confront
the hill on Hayes Street.
After conquering the hill, or
giving up, the course follows
parts of Divisadero and Fell
Streets before turning on to Ken
nedy, the main drive through
Golden Gate Park. The course
continues all the way through
the park on Kennedy and
emerges on the Great Highway,
200 yards from th 6 finish line.
