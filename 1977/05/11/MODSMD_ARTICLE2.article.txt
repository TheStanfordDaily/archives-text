# Protesters choose not to face arrest
## 
### Bill Burger 
Over HOC) people repeated Monday's
sit-in at the Old Union for five hours
before moving outside minutes before
they were told arrests would begin.
The sit-in followed a noon rally in
White Plaza where over 900 people
gathered to continue the campuswide
protest against the Board of Trustees'
decision to abstain on the Ford proxy
vote calling for the company to with
draw its holdings in South Africa.
James Siena, legal adviser to Presi
dent Richard Lyman, said last night
that no "internal disciplinary action
will be taken by the University"
against those students arrested in
Monday's sit-in. Students still face
criminal proceedings understate law.
Of the 294 people arrested Monday
night and early yesterday morning,
25.J were booked and all but three were
released on their own recognizance.
Another 41 signed citations and were
immediately released. Three men,
Steve Hansch, Reginald Mason and
lXike Crestfield, spent the night in jail.
Not arraigned
Mason was released on $500 bail at
2:30 p.m. yesterday, while Hansch and
Crestfield were not arraigned by the
time court ended at 5 p.m. yesterday
and were released with no charges.
Hansch and Crestfield could face
charges in the future, however.
When asked about the University's
decision to have Monday's protesters
arrested. Lyman said, "We found back
in the days when protests were preva
lent that it just didn't work to leave
people in the building. The complex
i on of the crowd can change faster than
vou can react to it."

lust after 4:30 p.m. a vote was taken
to indicate how many persons were
willing to continue participating in
the sit-in and face arrest. Approxi
mately 70 said they would stay; only a
few of those arrested Monday night
voted to face arrest a second time.
Continue the sit-in
This vote was immediately followed
by another to find whether the group
favored having some protesters con
tinue the sit-in. Loosely counted vote
totals showed protesters were evenly
split on the question, and a decision
was postponed.
Only a few minutes before 5 p.m..
the scheduled closing time for the
building, an almost unanimous deci
sion for all to abide by the majority
vote was adopted.
At that time, Chris Coleman, a
member of the Stanford Committee on
Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) indicated to the crowd that a
30 minute extension on the 5 p.m.
deadline had been granted by John
Schwarz, vice president for medical af
fairs.
Robert -Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said Schwartz was in
charge of University activities because
Lyman was in San Francisco at the
time, and Schwartz had experience
dealing with protests in the early
19705.
Delayed closing
Schwartz said he had delayed clos
ing Old Union in order to let protesters
hear a statement by the Board of Trus
tees. The board's statement was read to
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson by
Anne Henkels, another co-president.
Henkels called from San Francisco
where she had answered some of the
trustees' questions concerning the pro
testers' position and had given protes
ters here a running account of the
board's proceedings.
Larson said the board voted unani
mously to sustain the Trustees Invest
ment Committee's recommendation to
abstain on the Ford proxy vote.
Larson then told protesters he and
Henkels believed another sit-in would
be detrimental. He said if a small group
sat-in yesterday following Monday's
massive occupation of the building, "it
will be seen as a second try that didn't
quite make it."
'Outrageous'
The demonstrators then declared
unanimously that the board's action is
"not satisfactory and is outrageous."
The question of continuing the sit-in
was again raised. Senior Seth Foldy
spoke in favor of remaining in the
building. He said to the protesters:
"This sit-in makes it clear we won't go
away. What we did last night was right
and the board's decision today was at
rocious."
Alumnus Chris Cray and junior

Mike Jennings spoke against continu
ing the sit-in and stressed the reduced
impact a second disturbance would
have on the board. Both called for
further community support for the
cause and mentioned problems
another group of arrests could give the
movement.
The vote was then taken at 5:25 p.m.
and by a margin of about 180 to 135,
the group decided to vacate the build
ing. The crowd quickly left, chanting:
"The people, united, will never be de
feated."
The conference continued in the Old
Union courtyard for one hour. Peti
tions calling for dismissal of all
charges against foreign students in
volved in Monday's sit-in were circu
lated in the crowd while speeches
were given for and against a campus
wide strike tomorrow.
Told the crowd
At 6:20 p.m., Samuel Manuel, a
member of the Los Angeles Committee
Against Racism, told the crowd, which
then numbered about 200, that he had
given up a speaking engagement to
come here on Monday. "To participate
in the struggle against apartheid is
much more important than talking
about the struggle against apartheid,"
Manuel said.
Manuel noted this is. not the first
group to fight against apartheid and
that the struggle is likely to be a long
one.
Junior Eddie Sosa announced a
SCRIP meeting would take place at
Casa Zapata at 8 p.m. The crowd then
sang "We Shall Overcome" while

forming a large circle and holding
hands.
According to Cray, those at the
SCRIP meeting decided to have some
sort of "quiet symbolic protest" on
Thursday. Cray indicated the focus of
SCRIP in the next 10 days will be on a
massive education campaign teaching
people "why we are involved, and
why our sit-in was an overwhelming
success.
"We can't believe the trustees won't
vote yes next year," he said.
Arrest procedure
During yesterday's sit-in, de
monstrators repeatedly expressed
concern over what arrest procedure
they might face.
Several legal advisers testified that
those arrested would have difficulty
being released on their own recogni
zance, whereas those arrested Monday
had little trouble getting such a re
lease.
The decision not to take University
action against those arrested Monday
might have been different, legal ad
viser Siena said, if demonstrators had
taken a different course of action yes
terday.
Instead of continuing the sit-in, pro
testers had suggested an all-night vigil
in the Old Union courtyard, a takeover
of a University office and a march to
Lyman's front lawn to hold a potluck
dinner. None of these suggestions
were voted on.

and the board's decision today was at
rocious."
Alumnus Chris Cray and junior

Mike Jennings spoke against continu
ing the sit-in and stressed the reduced
impact a second disturbance would
have on the board. Both called for
further community support for the
cause and mentioned problems
another group of arrests could give the
movement.
The vote was then taken at 5:25 p.m.
and by a margin of about 180 to 135,
the group decided to vacate the build
ing. The crowd quickly left, chanting:
"The people, united, will never be de
feated."
The conference continued in the Old
Union courtyard for one hour. Peti
tions calling for dismissal of all
charges against foreign students in
volved in Monday's sit-in were circu
lated in the crowd while speeches
were given for and against a campus
wide strike tomorrow.
Told the crowd
At 6:20 p.m., Samuel Manuel, a
member of the Los Angeles Committee
Against Racism, told the crowd, which
then numbered about 200, that he had
given up a speaking engagement to
come here on Monday. "To participate
in the struggle against apartheid is
much more important than talking
about the struggle against apartheid,"
Manuel said.
Manuel noted this is. not the first
group to fight against apartheid and
that the struggle is likely to be a long
one.
Junior Eddie Sosa announced a
SCRIP meeting would take place at
Casa Zapata at 8 p.m. The crowd then
sang "We Shall Overcome" while

forming a large circle and holding
hands.
According to Cray, those at the
SCRIP meeting decided to have some
sort of "quiet symbolic protest" on
Thursday. Cray indicated the focus of
SCRIP in the next 10 days will be on a
massive education campaign teaching
people "why we are involved, and
why our sit-in was an overwhelming
success.
"We can't believe the trustees won't
vote yes next year," he said.
Arrest procedure
During yesterday's sit-in, de
monstrators repeatedly expressed
concern over what arrest procedure
they might face.
Several legal advisers testified that
those arrested would have difficulty
being released on their own recogni
zance, whereas those arrested Monday
had little trouble getting such a re
lease.
The decision not to take University
action against those arrested Monday
might have been different, legal ad
viser Siena said, if demonstrators had
taken a different course of action yes
terday.
Instead of continuing the sit-in, pro
testers had suggested an all-night vigil
in the Old Union courtyard, a takeover
of a University office and a march to
Lyman's front lawn to hold a potluck
dinner. None of these suggestions
were voted on.
(Contributing reporters to this story
were Jacob Young, Jim Tranquado,
Bonny Rodden, Randy Keith and
George Anders.)
Over HOC) people repeated Monday's
sit-in at the Old Union for five hours
before moving outside minutes before
they were told arrests would begin.
The sit-in followed a noon rally in
White Plaza where over 900 people
gathered to continue the campuswide
protest against the Board of Trustees'
decision to abstain on the Ford proxy
vote calling for the company to with
draw its holdings in South Africa.
James Siena, legal adviser to Presi
dent Richard Lyman, said last night
that no "internal disciplinary action
will be taken by the University"
against those students arrested in
Monday's sit-in. Students still face
criminal proceedings understate law.
Of the 294 people arrested Monday
night and early yesterday morning,
25.J were booked and all but three were
released on their own recognizance.
Another 41 signed citations and were
immediately released. Three men,
Steve Hansch, Reginald Mason and
lXike Crestfield, spent the night in jail.
Not arraigned
Mason was released on $500 bail at
2:30 p.m. yesterday, while Hansch and
Crestfield were not arraigned by the
time court ended at 5 p.m. yesterday
and were released with no charges.
Hansch and Crestfield could face
charges in the future, however.
When asked about the University's
decision to have Monday's protesters
arrested. Lyman said, "We found back
in the days when protests were preva
lent that it just didn't work to leave
people in the building. The complex
i on of the crowd can change faster than
vou can react to it."

lust after 4:30 p.m. a vote was taken
to indicate how many persons were
willing to continue participating in
the sit-in and face arrest. Approxi
mately 70 said they would stay; only a
few of those arrested Monday night
voted to face arrest a second time.
Continue the sit-in
This vote was immediately followed
by another to find whether the group
favored having some protesters con
tinue the sit-in. Loosely counted vote
totals showed protesters were evenly
split on the question, and a decision
was postponed.
Only a few minutes before 5 p.m..
the scheduled closing time for the
building, an almost unanimous deci
sion for all to abide by the majority
vote was adopted.
At that time, Chris Coleman, a
member of the Stanford Committee on
Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) indicated to the crowd that a
30 minute extension on the 5 p.m.
deadline had been granted by John
Schwarz, vice president for medical af
fairs.
Robert -Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said Schwartz was in
charge of University activities because
Lyman was in San Francisco at the
time, and Schwartz had experience
dealing with protests in the early
19705.
Delayed closing
Schwartz said he had delayed clos
ing Old Union in order to let protesters
hear a statement by the Board of Trus
tees. The board's statement was read to
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson by
Anne Henkels, another co-president.
Henkels called from San Francisco
where she had answered some of the
trustees' questions concerning the pro
testers' position and had given protes
ters here a running account of the
board's proceedings.
Larson said the board voted unani
mously to sustain the Trustees Invest
ment Committee's recommendation to
abstain on the Ford proxy vote.
Larson then told protesters he and
Henkels believed another sit-in would
be detrimental. He said if a small group
sat-in yesterday following Monday's
massive occupation of the building, "it
will be seen as a second try that didn't
quite make it."
'Outrageous'
The demonstrators then declared
unanimously that the board's action is
"not satisfactory and is outrageous."
The question of continuing the sit-in
was again raised. Senior Seth Foldy
spoke in favor of remaining in the
building. He said to the protesters:
"This sit-in makes it clear we won't go
away. What we did last night was right
and the board's decision today was at
rocious."

time court ended at 5 p.m. yesterday
and were released with no charges.
Hansch and Crestfield could face
charges in the future, however.
When asked about the University's
decision to have Monday's protesters
arrested. Lyman said, "We found back
in the days when protests were preva
lent that it just didn't work to leave
people in the building. The complex
i on of the crowd can change faster than
vou can react to it."

lust after 4:30 p.m. a vote was taken
to indicate how many persons were
willing to continue participating in
the sit-in and face arrest. Approxi
mately 70 said they would stay; only a
few of those arrested Monday night
voted to face arrest a second time.
Continue the sit-in
This vote was immediately followed
by another to find whether the group
favored having some protesters con
tinue the sit-in. Loosely counted vote
totals showed protesters were evenly
split on the question, and a decision
was postponed.
Only a few minutes before 5 p.m..
the scheduled closing time for the
building, an almost unanimous deci
sion for all to abide by the majority
vote was adopted.
At that time, Chris Coleman, a
member of the Stanford Committee on
Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) indicated to the crowd that a
30 minute extension on the 5 p.m.
deadline had been granted by John
Schwarz, vice president for medical af
fairs.
Robert -Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said Schwartz was in
charge of University activities because
Lyman was in San Francisco at the
time, and Schwartz had experience
dealing with protests in the early
19705.
Delayed closing
Schwartz said he had delayed clos
ing Old Union in order to let protesters
hear a statement by the Board of Trus
tees. The board's statement was read to
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson by
Anne Henkels, another co-president.
Henkels called from San Francisco
where she had answered some of the
trustees' questions concerning the pro
testers' position and had given protes
ters here a running account of the
board's proceedings.
Larson said the board voted unani
mously to sustain the Trustees Invest
ment Committee's recommendation to
abstain on the Ford proxy vote.
Larson then told protesters he and
Henkels believed another sit-in would
be detrimental. He said if a small group
sat-in yesterday following Monday's
massive occupation of the building, "it
will be seen as a second try that didn't
quite make it."
'Outrageous'
The demonstrators then declared
unanimously that the board's action is
"not satisfactory and is outrageous."
The question of continuing the sit-in
was again raised. Senior Seth Foldy
spoke in favor of remaining in the
building. He said to the protesters:
"This sit-in makes it clear we won't go
away. What we did last night was right
and the board's decision today was at
rocious."
Alumnus Chris Cray and junior

Mike Jennings spoke against continu
ing the sit-in and stressed the reduced
impact a second disturbance would
have on the board. Both called for
further community support for the
cause and mentioned problems
another group of arrests could give the
movement.
The vote was then taken at 5:25 p.m.
and by a margin of about 180 to 135,
the group decided to vacate the build
ing. The crowd quickly left, chanting:
"The people, united, will never be de
feated."
The conference continued in the Old
Union courtyard for one hour. Peti
tions calling for dismissal of all
charges against foreign students in
volved in Monday's sit-in were circu
lated in the crowd while speeches
were given for and against a campus
wide strike tomorrow.
Told the crowd
At 6:20 p.m., Samuel Manuel, a
member of the Los Angeles Committee
Against Racism, told the crowd, which
then numbered about 200, that he had
given up a speaking engagement to
come here on Monday. "To participate
in the struggle against apartheid is
much more important than talking
about the struggle against apartheid,"
Manuel said.
Manuel noted this is. not the first
group to fight against apartheid and
that the struggle is likely to be a long
one.
Junior Eddie Sosa announced a
SCRIP meeting would take place at
Casa Zapata at 8 p.m. The crowd then
sang "We Shall Overcome" while

forming a large circle and holding
hands.
According to Cray, those at the
SCRIP meeting decided to have some
sort of "quiet symbolic protest" on
Thursday. Cray indicated the focus of
SCRIP in the next 10 days will be on a
massive education campaign teaching
people "why we are involved, and
why our sit-in was an overwhelming
success.
"We can't believe the trustees won't
vote yes next year," he said.
Arrest procedure
During yesterday's sit-in, de
monstrators repeatedly expressed
concern over what arrest procedure
they might face.
Several legal advisers testified that
those arrested would have difficulty
being released on their own recogni
zance, whereas those arrested Monday
had little trouble getting such a re
lease.
The decision not to take University
action against those arrested Monday
might have been different, legal ad
viser Siena said, if demonstrators had
taken a different course of action yes
terday.
Instead of continuing the sit-in, pro
testers had suggested an all-night vigil
in the Old Union courtyard, a takeover
of a University office and a march to
Lyman's front lawn to hold a potluck
dinner. None of these suggestions
were voted on.
(Contributing reporters to this story
were Jacob Young, Jim Tranquado,
Bonny Rodden, Randy Keith and
George Anders.)
Over HOC) people repeated Monday's
sit-in at the Old Union for five hours
before moving outside minutes before
they were told arrests would begin.
The sit-in followed a noon rally in
White Plaza where over 900 people
gathered to continue the campuswide
protest against the Board of Trustees'
decision to abstain on the Ford proxy
vote calling for the company to with
draw its holdings in South Africa.
James Siena, legal adviser to Presi
dent Richard Lyman, said last night
that no "internal disciplinary action
will be taken by the University"
against those students arrested in
Monday's sit-in. Students still face
criminal proceedings understate law.
Of the 294 people arrested Monday
night and early yesterday morning,
25.J were booked and all but three were
released on their own recognizance.
Another 41 signed citations and were
immediately released. Three men,
Steve Hansch, Reginald Mason and
lXike Crestfield, spent the night in jail.
Not arraigned
Mason was released on $500 bail at
2:30 p.m. yesterday, while Hansch and
Crestfield were not arraigned by the
time court ended at 5 p.m. yesterday
and were released with no charges.
Hansch and Crestfield could face
