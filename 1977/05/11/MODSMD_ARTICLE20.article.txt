# BOARD OF TRUSTEES STATEMENT ON INVESTMENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
## 
### 
Following is a statement adopted
unanimously by the Stanford Board
of Trustees Tuesday, May 10, 1977:
The Stanford Board of Trustees to
day lias given lengthy and careful con
sideration to the recommendation of
its Investments Committee that it con
firm the earlier decision to abstain
from voting on the South Africa in
vestments issue now before the Ford
Motor Company stockholders.
The Board voted unanimously to
sustain the Committee's recommenda
tion.
During the course of the day, the
Board heard extensive reports on stu
dent concern over these issues, includ
ing clear and eloquent statements
from the Associated Students Council
of Presidents. The members of the
Board are aware of the deeply held
convictions of many members of the
Stanford community on the issue of
investment in American companies
with facilities in South Africa.

There is no doubt whatsoever that
the members of the Board of Trustees
each hold a deep aversion to the prac
tice of apartheid and an equally deep
wish to see it end peacefully.
There is no dispute on that issue.
What is in dispute is the much nar
rower question of whether Stanford
University can best take a step toward
that end by voting "yes" on the
proxies or by abstaining and making
its views known in writing to the
heads of the corporations involved.
Between those two positions lies
no difference of principle, but a dif
ference of judgment about which of
two essentially symbolic tactics is
more likely to succeed. That the ac
tion taken by the Board has been
heard and taken seriously by execu
tives of the affected corporations is
indicated by the responses received
thus far.
The Board agreed to ask the staff
to conduct a survey of Stanford in

vestments in corporations doing busi
ness in South Africa, and agreed to a
meeting between three of its members
and a like number of Stanford Com
mittee for Responsible Investment
Policy members at which one topic
for discussion will be the structure
and role of the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility.
The Board respects the conviction
of those members of the community
who have expressed their views by
fasting and by other nonviolent, legal
means. However, the Board does not
condone the unlawful occupation of
University property for the purpose of
making political statements, regardless
of their content.
We regret that what are, in fact,
limited tactical differences have been
made to appear as large issues of prin
ciple. We ask all of those involved to
refocus on the truly important mat
ters and on the progress that has al
ready been made.
