Carter calls for stronger NATO
London — President Jimmy Carter warned the
North Atlantic alliance yesterday it should toughen
up to match Communist buildup of an offensive
force in Europe and then flew home from his first
round of summitry.
Carter said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) should make "high priority improvements"
in the European forces, report on progress in De
cember and submit a full program to a NATO summit
next spring in Washington.
The president spoke to a NATO ministerial meet
ing in gilded, red-carpeted Lancaster House near
Parliament. He spent the rest of the day talking pri
vately with individual prime ministers of NATO
countries.
Carter said in his speech:
"The threat facing the alliance has grown steadily
in recent years. The Soviet Union has achieved es
sential nuclear equivalence. Its theater nuclear
forces have been strengthened.
"The Warsaw Pact's conventional forces in Europe
emphasize an offensive posture. These forces are
much stronger than needed for any defense pur
pose," Carter said.
His speech was the last formal presentation of his
first trip abroad as president. He returned to
Washington late last night.
Over the past five days, here and in Ceneva, Carter
met with such leaders as President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing of France, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of
West Germany, President Hafez Assad of Syria and
Premiers Constantine Caramanlis of Greece and

Suleyman Demirel of Turkey.
Committee OKs U.S.-Cuba trade
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted yesterday to partially lift the trade
embargo against Cuba to permit that nation to
purchase agricultural, food and medical supplies in
the U.S. market.
However, it balked at opening U.S. markets to
exports of sugar and other Cuban agricultural pro
ducts after senators heard arguments that such a step
would give away an important bargaining chip in
continuing negotiations with the government of
President Fidel Castro.
The amendment, a diluted form of the proposal
offered by Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.), was
adopted 10-6.
The original McGovern amendment would have
lifted the embargo on imports of Cuban agricultural
products and medicines entirely.
Young joins ambassadors in Africa
Abidjan, Ivory Coast — The Carter Administra
tion's developing African policy will safeguard the

United Nations, said President Jimmy Carter's Afri
can policy stresses "development and food, and not
warfare and destruction."
The three-day meeting opened Young's second

visit to Africa since he became head of the U.S.
delegation at the United Nations.

Carter calls for stronger NATO
London — President Jimmy Carter warned the
North Atlantic alliance yesterday it should toughen
up to match Communist buildup of an offensive
force in Europe and then flew home from his first
round of summitry.
Carter said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) should make "high priority improvements"
in the European forces, report on progress in De
cember and submit a full program to a NATO summit
next spring in Washington.
The president spoke to a NATO ministerial meet
ing in gilded, red-carpeted Lancaster House near
Parliament. He spent the rest of the day talking pri
vately with individual prime ministers of NATO
countries.
Carter said in his speech:
"The threat facing the alliance has grown steadily
in recent years. The Soviet Union has achieved es
sential nuclear equivalence. Its theater nuclear
forces have been strengthened.
"The Warsaw Pact's conventional forces in Europe
emphasize an offensive posture. These forces are
much stronger than needed for any defense pur
pose," Carter said.
His speech was the last formal presentation of his
first trip abroad as president. He returned to
Washington late last night.
Over the past five days, here and in Ceneva, Carter
met with such leaders as President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing of France, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of
West Germany, President Hafez Assad of Syria and
Premiers Constantine Caramanlis of Greece and

Suleyman Demirel of Turkey.
Committee OKs U.S.-Cuba trade
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted yesterday to partially lift the trade
embargo against Cuba to permit that nation to
purchase agricultural, food and medical supplies in
the U.S. market.
However, it balked at opening U.S. markets to
exports of sugar and other Cuban agricultural pro
ducts after senators heard arguments that such a step
would give away an important bargaining chip in
continuing negotiations with the government of
President Fidel Castro.
The amendment, a diluted form of the proposal
offered by Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.), was
adopted 10-6.
The original McGovern amendment would have
lifted the embargo on imports of Cuban agricultural
products and medicines entirely.
