With the announcement yesterday
that the University will not take any
internal action against protesters ar
rested Monday night, arrested stu
dents can apparently rest easier about
the status of most scholarship monies
they might bold.
"We don't withdraw Stanford finan
cial aid as long as the student is still
able to enroll and has demonstrated
financial need." said Financial Aids
Director Robert Huff when asked about
possible repercussions from a student
being convicted either by a court or the
Stanford Judicial Council.
Council.
"1 don't know whether federal or
state aid will be affected, I simply can't
say," said Huff. "This will have to be
reviewed by lawyers to determine if
federal and state statutes concerning
student disruption have been violated.

"From my understanding what con
stitutes disruption is open to discus
sion."
"No way," said Assistant Registrar
Walter Findeissen when asked if being
arrested would affect veteran's be
nefits. Matters would be changed,
though, he said, if students were
forced to drop classes.
"My opinion is that nothing will
happen to foreign students based on
what happened last night," said Direc
tor of the Bechtel International Center
Lee Ziegler.
"In order for a student to lose his
student visa he must lose his student
status or commit a crime of moral tur
pitude." Ziegler said he would be sur
prised if the sit-in were considered
such a crime.
Representatives of the California
â€¢State Scholarship Commission were
not available for comment.
