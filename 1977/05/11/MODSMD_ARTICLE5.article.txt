# Board tells SCRIP abstention stands
## 
### Mike Charison 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
voted unanimously to sustain the re
commendations of its Committee on
Investments and not reverse last
month's decision to abstain on a Ford
Motor Company shareholder proposal
calling for company divestment from
South Africa.
The board also voted to accept
committee recommendations to:
—publish letters sent to the com
panies explaining the abstention along
with the corporate responses in the
Daily;
—to undertake a study on costs and
benefits of University divestment from
corporations with South African in
vestments;
—to have President Richard Lyman
and two other members of the trustee
investment committee meet with
members of the Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) witliin the next few weeks;
and
—to discuss possible alterations in
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR).
Announcement of the board deci
sion was made by Board President Dr.
Peter Bing who read a statement which
board members prepared.
The decision came after what Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig called "the longest con
sideration of a single issue" he could
remember. Trustee Otis"Pease called
the session "as constructive as I've
heard in a long time."
'No doubt'
"There is no doubt whatsoever that
the members of the Board of Trustees
each hold a deep aversion to the prac
tice of apartheid," the board stated.
"What is in dispute is the much nar
rower question of whether Stanford
University can best take a step toward
that end (ending apartheid) by voting
yes on the proxies or by abstaining and
making its views known in writing to
the heads of the corporations involved.
"Between those two positions lies
no difference of principle, but a differ
ence of judgment about which of two
essentially symbolic tactics is more
likely to succeed," the statement read.
University proxies on the Ford
shareholder proposal will be voted as
an abstention at the Ford annual meet
ing tomorrow.
SCRIP stays home
No members of SCRIP traveled to the
board offices in San Francisco for the
meeting, though SCRIP member Kim
McCall had been allowed to present
his organizations viewpoint to the
board Investment's Committee at its
meeting there Monday.
Before the full board convened yes
terday, Anne Henkels, Glenn Jordan
and Greg Larson, three newly-elected
ASSU Co-presidents (COP), did ap
pear before the Academic Affairs
Committee. Henkels said.
She said the group was greeted
warmly and listened carefully to Jor
dan's explanation of Monday's sit-in at
Old Union which resulted in the arrest
of 294 students. Jordan told the com
mittee some reasons for the protesters'
position on the issue, Henkels said.

Larson reportedly added comments
indicating the seriousness of student
sentiment and Henkels said she spoke
about the "growing consciousness
nationwide" on the issue of corporate
investment in the racist South African
regime.
Not just students
Not just students but church groups,
citizen groups and the government are
urging corporations to divest, Henkels
said she told the board.
All three COP members ended their
statements with a plea for an im
provement in communication bet
ween students and the board.
"Communications between trustees
and students has to be improved and
made more effective," Henkels said.
Trustees complained to the COP that
they felt students had a misconception
of the board as being unwilling to
communicate, according to Larson.
"We felt they were really sincere
when they said they were deeply dis
turbed by the students' claim that they
were insensitive to student concerns,"
Henkels said.
'Clear and eloquent'
The board statement called the COP
members' presentations "clear and
eloquent."
Pease, who chairs the Academic Af
fairs Committee, agreed board com
munication lines with the students
must be improved, but much of this
must come from individual trustees,
not from the board as a group.
"It has to be done individually be
cause the board must be at least one
step removed from the University."
Pease said. "Between the board and
the University must come the ad
ministration."
"The board must not intervene in
the administration of the University,"
Pease said.
Henkels and Lawrence Cerf, student
member of the trustee Committee on
Investments, stayed in San Francisco
for the afternoon board session while
Jordan and Larson returned to the Uni
versity to talk with students who reoc
cupied the Old Union lobby yesterday.
Board aware
In the board statement, members
claimed to be "aware of the deeply
held convictions of many members of
the Stanford community." But Hen
kels said the board still had failed to
address two points:
—Why U.S. corporations can justify
staying in South Africa by claiming to
be progressive forces for change while
black majority leaders have urged
foreign corporations to get out of
South Africa; and
—Why the trustees have failed to
concretely demonstrate how U.S. cor
porations have been and are being
progressive forces for change in South
Africa.
Cerf, however, said Bing "is ex
tremely familiar with the South Africa
issue from both sides and very in
formed on both views."
"I think this has dramatically sen
sitized issues with the trustees," Cerf
said. He said he felt in the future, most
South Africa issues would receive the
attention of the full board.

month's decision to abstain on a Ford
Motor Company shareholder proposal
calling for company divestment from
South Africa.
The board also voted to accept
committee recommendations to:
—publish letters sent to the com
panies explaining the abstention along
with the corporate responses in the
Daily;
—to undertake a study on costs and
benefits of University divestment from
corporations with South African in
vestments;
—to have President Richard Lyman
and two other members of the trustee
investment committee meet with
members of the Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) witliin the next few weeks;
and

Announcement of the board deci
sion was made by Board President Dr.
Peter Bing who read a statement which
board members prepared.
The decision came after what Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig called "the longest con
sideration of a single issue" he could
remember. Trustee Otis"Pease called
the session "as constructive as I've
heard in a long time."
'No doubt'
"There is no doubt whatsoever that
the members of the Board of Trustees
each hold a deep aversion to the prac
tice of apartheid," the board stated.
"What is in dispute is the much nar
rower question of whether Stanford
University can best take a step toward
that end (ending apartheid) by voting
yes on the proxies or by abstaining and
making its views known in writing to
the heads of the corporations involved.
"Between those two positions lies
no difference of principle, but a differ
ence of judgment about which of two
essentially symbolic tactics is more
likely to succeed," the statement read.
University proxies on the Ford
shareholder proposal will be voted as
an abstention at the Ford annual meet
ing tomorrow.
SCRIP stays home
No members of SCRIP traveled to the
board offices in San Francisco for the
meeting, though SCRIP member Kim
McCall had been allowed to present
his organizations viewpoint to the
board Investment's Committee at its
meeting there Monday.
Before the full board convened yes
terday, Anne Henkels, Glenn Jordan
and Greg Larson, three newly-elected
ASSU Co-presidents (COP), did ap
pear before the Academic Affairs
Committee. Henkels said.
She said the group was greeted
warmly and listened carefully to Jor
dan's explanation of Monday's sit-in at
Old Union which resulted in the arrest
of 294 students. Jordan told the com
mittee some reasons for the protesters'
position on the issue, Henkels said.

Larson reportedly added comments
indicating the seriousness of student
sentiment and Henkels said she spoke
about the "growing consciousness
nationwide" on the issue of corporate
investment in the racist South African
regime.
Not just students
Not just students but church groups,
citizen groups and the government are
urging corporations to divest, Henkels
said she told the board.
All three COP members ended their
statements with a plea for an im
provement in communication bet
ween students and the board.
"Communications between trustees
and students has to be improved and
made more effective," Henkels said.
Trustees complained to the COP that
they felt students had a misconception
of the board as being unwilling to
communicate, according to Larson.
"We felt they were really sincere
when they said they were deeply dis
turbed by the students' claim that they
were insensitive to student concerns,"
Henkels said.
'Clear and eloquent'
The board statement called the COP
members' presentations "clear and
eloquent."
Pease, who chairs the Academic Af
fairs Committee, agreed board com
munication lines with the students
must be improved, but much of this
must come from individual trustees,
not from the board as a group.
"It has to be done individually be
cause the board must be at least one
step removed from the University."
Pease said. "Between the board and
the University must come the ad
ministration."
"The board must not intervene in
the administration of the University,"
Pease said.
Henkels and Lawrence Cerf, student
member of the trustee Committee on
Investments, stayed in San Francisco
for the afternoon board session while
Jordan and Larson returned to the Uni
versity to talk with students who reoc
cupied the Old Union lobby yesterday.
Board aware
In the board statement, members
claimed to be "aware of the deeply
held convictions of many members of
the Stanford community." But Hen
kels said the board still had failed to
address two points:
—Why U.S. corporations can justify
staying in South Africa by claiming to
be progressive forces for change while
black majority leaders have urged
foreign corporations to get out of
South Africa; and
—Why the trustees have failed to
concretely demonstrate how U.S. cor
porations have been and are being
progressive forces for change in South
Africa.
Cerf, however, said Bing "is ex
tremely familiar with the South Africa
issue from both sides and very in
formed on both views."
"I think this has dramatically sen
sitized issues with the trustees," Cerf
said. He said he felt in the future, most
South Africa issues would receive the
attention of the full board.

—publish letters sent to the com
panies explaining the abstention along
with the corporate responses in the
Daily;
—to undertake a study on costs and
benefits of University divestment from
corporations with South African in
vestments;
—to have President Richard Lyman
and two other members of the trustee
investment committee meet with
members of the Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) witliin the next few weeks;
and
—to discuss possible alterations in
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR).
Announcement of the board deci
sion was made by Board President Dr.
Peter Bing who read a statement which
board members prepared.
The decision came after what Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig called "the longest con
sideration of a single issue" he could
remember. Trustee Otis"Pease called
the session "as constructive as I've
heard in a long time."
'No doubt'
"There is no doubt whatsoever that
the members of the Board of Trustees
each hold a deep aversion to the prac
tice of apartheid," the board stated.
"What is in dispute is the much nar
rower question of whether Stanford
University can best take a step toward
that end (ending apartheid) by voting
yes on the proxies or by abstaining and
making its views known in writing to
the heads of the corporations involved.
"Between those two positions lies
no difference of principle, but a differ
ence of judgment about which of two
essentially symbolic tactics is more
likely to succeed," the statement read.
University proxies on the Ford
shareholder proposal will be voted as
an abstention at the Ford annual meet
ing tomorrow.
SCRIP stays home
No members of SCRIP traveled to the
board offices in San Francisco for the
meeting, though SCRIP member Kim
McCall had been allowed to present
his organizations viewpoint to the
board Investment's Committee at its
meeting there Monday.
Before the full board convened yes
terday, Anne Henkels, Glenn Jordan
and Greg Larson, three newly-elected
ASSU Co-presidents (COP), did ap
pear before the Academic Affairs
Committee. Henkels said.
She said the group was greeted
warmly and listened carefully to Jor
dan's explanation of Monday's sit-in at
Old Union which resulted in the arrest
of 294 students. Jordan told the com
mittee some reasons for the protesters'
position on the issue, Henkels said.

Larson reportedly added comments
indicating the seriousness of student
sentiment and Henkels said she spoke
about the "growing consciousness
nationwide" on the issue of corporate
investment in the racist South African
regime.
Not just students
Not just students but church groups,
citizen groups and the government are
urging corporations to divest, Henkels
said she told the board.
All three COP members ended their
statements with a plea for an im
provement in communication bet
ween students and the board.
"Communications between trustees
and students has to be improved and
made more effective," Henkels said.
Trustees complained to the COP that
they felt students had a misconception
of the board as being unwilling to
communicate, according to Larson.
"We felt they were really sincere
when they said they were deeply dis
turbed by the students' claim that they
were insensitive to student concerns,"
Henkels said.
'Clear and eloquent'
The board statement called the COP
members' presentations "clear and
eloquent."
Pease, who chairs the Academic Af
fairs Committee, agreed board com
munication lines with the students
must be improved, but much of this
must come from individual trustees,
not from the board as a group.
"It has to be done individually be
cause the board must be at least one
step removed from the University."
Pease said. "Between the board and
the University must come the ad
ministration."
"The board must not intervene in
the administration of the University,"
Pease said.
Henkels and Lawrence Cerf, student
member of the trustee Committee on
Investments, stayed in San Francisco
for the afternoon board session while
Jordan and Larson returned to the Uni
versity to talk with students who reoc
cupied the Old Union lobby yesterday.
Board aware
In the board statement, members
claimed to be "aware of the deeply
held convictions of many members of
the Stanford community." But Hen
kels said the board still had failed to
address two points:
—Why U.S. corporations can justify
staying in South Africa by claiming to
be progressive forces for change while
black majority leaders have urged
foreign corporations to get out of
South Africa; and
—Why the trustees have failed to
concretely demonstrate how U.S. cor
porations have been and are being
progressive forces for change in South
Africa.
Cerf, however, said Bing "is ex
tremely familiar with the South Africa
issue from both sides and very in
formed on both views."
"I think this has dramatically sen
sitized issues with the trustees," Cerf
said. He said he felt in the future, most
South Africa issues would receive the
attention of the full board.
