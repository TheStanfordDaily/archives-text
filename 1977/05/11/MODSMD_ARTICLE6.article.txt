# Nat'l health woes
## 
### 
Many of the advocates of na
tional health insurance and total
socialized medicine seem to
have become prisoners of their
own rhetoric. Leonard Wood
cock, president of the United
Auto Workers, is reported to
have said that "if the bill on na
tional health insurance is
enacted, no American ever again
would have to pay a doctor's bill
or a hospital bill."
One can only wonder who he
thinks would—the Arab sheiks?
Unfortunately, "laundering the
money we pay through
Washington is simply a
different—and more
expensive—way to pay our hos
pital or doctor's bills" (Milton
Friedman).
There is simply no free
lunch—the national cost of
health care is not likely to de
crease, or even stabilize, with the
advent of socialized medicine
(Martin Feldstein, testimony to
the Senate Subcommittee on
Health), since the rise in health
cost is due to a plethora of diffe
rent factors.
Malpractice suits and un
necessary preventive medicine,
the geometric growth in
technology with the concomit
ant increase in demand for skil
led workers, and the vulnerabil
ity of the health field to inflation
because of a high labor content
and low productivity potential
are some of them (Walter
McNerny, president, Blue Cross
Association).
There are two additional factors,
which socialized medicine can
only serve to intensify. Overbur
densome government regula
tions are currently a prime cause
of increased costs. Some hospi
tals must cope with up to 1000
conflicting regulations enforced
by up to 100 overlapping, and
sometimes conflicting, agencies.
For example, the Florida Hos
pital Association estimated that
it cost its members $50 million to
comply with one particular
safety statute.
Government administration
would only exacerbate the
foregoing problems, and it
would be less economical, ac
cording to studies done by the
General Accounting Office. In
Great Britain, the National
Health Service is operated
through three separate adminis
trative agencies; a recent reor
ganization left five separate
layers of bureaucracy. There are
an endless number of boards,
committees and regional au
thorities. In fact, as much as 30
per cent of the cost of the entire

system goes to administrative
costs.
However, the factor which
would increase costs the most is
simply the increased demand on
the system. Political beliefs do
not repeal economic forces; by
destroying the cash nexus bet
ween demand and supply, one
unleashes a limitless demand.
The good would be "free," so
there would be no reason not to
demand it, yet the supply is still
limited.
The United States has suffered
this to a certain extent, because
Americans pay less than one
tenth of their hospital bills and
one-third of their physician's
fees directly.

The increased demand has re
sulted in near-chaos for Great
Britain. The patient must queue
up for an appointment with the
general practitioner (GP), which
lasts an average of 6V2 minutes.
His name is then added to a
waiting list and it may be weeks
or even months before he can see
a consultant for the first time.
For "non-urgent" operations
one may wait for months or years
to get a bed (there have been rare
cases of six-year waits). Tonsil
lectomies may take up to six
months; a hernia, two years; var
icose veins or hemorrhoids, at
least two years. At any one time
there are from 500,000 to
700,000 people waiting for oper
ations or treatment in hospitals.
Over two-thirds of the British
hospitals were built before 1890.
Shortages of equipment and
supplies are rife. For example, at
the Kingston-on-Thames Hospi
tal in Surrey, emergency opera
tions have had to be delayed
while doctors and nurses
searched for clean and usable li
nens. The hospital has also re
peatedly run out of surgical
gowns and bed linens.
The inevitable result Is that
"people who are well
connected, hypochondriacs
with time on their hands and the
simply persisten get an undue
share" (Friedman). In Britain,
older patients with shorter life

expectancies are passed over for
younger, and thus more "hope
ful" cases. One doctor has noted
that "if the very sick have not
died as a result of the long lists of
people waiting for treatment, it's
also true that the not-so-sick
have remained ill for longer or
suffered from remediable condi
tions for longer."
Neither patients nor doctors
have been satisfied with the sys
tem. Sincrf 1966 the equivalent
of one-third of the annual output
of Britain's medical schools have
been emigrating each year. Pri
vate hospitals are burgeoning
and over 2.5 million Britons now
belong to private insurance
plans—an increase of 300,000
over the past four years.
No, socialized medicine is not
the route to go; the high costs of
medical care would only be
exacerbated by government con
trol and must be dealt with in
other ways. Since 90 per cent of
Americans subscribe to private
health insurance, which is var
ied enough to meet diverse
needs, the imposition of a stan
dardized system by the govern
ment is not the most effective
way to meet the problems of
low-income families.
Rather, those who cannot af
ford adequate medical care
should be taken care of by an ex
panded and more efficient
medic program. It must be
borne in mind that all Americans
would still pay the bill with
socialized medicine—simply in
a less direct and more expensive
manner.
Even some liberals have rec
ognized the problems inherent
with such monumental gov
ernmental interference with the
economy. Sen. Abraham
Ribicoff (D-Conn.) has noted that
"imposing a giant new federal
health program would only dis
illusion many by promising
more than it can deliver."
We simply do not have the
administrative capacity to ad
minister and to pay claims for
over 200 million Americans,
deal with 7000 hospitals, over
320,000 doctors and the count
less other segments of the health
industry.
Nor does our health care sys
tem have the capacity to deliver
all the increased demand for ser
vices which fully federalized na
tional health insurance would
induce."
The American public should
be careful before plunging over
the precipice of socialized
medicine. Paying more for less
may be a Utopian paradise to
some, but it certainly won't heal
the injured and cure the sick.

tions for longer."
Neither patients nor doctors
have been satisfied with the sys

of one-third of the annual output
of Britain's medical schools have
been emigrating each year. Pri
vate hospitals are burgeoning
and over 2.5 million Britons now
belong to private insurance
plans—an increase of 300,000
over the past four years.
No, socialized medicine is not
the route to go; the high costs of
medical care would only be
exacerbated by government con
trol and must be dealt with in
other ways. Since 90 per cent of
Americans subscribe to private
health insurance, which is var
ied enough to meet diverse
needs, the imposition of a stan
dardized system by the govern
ment is not the most effective
way to meet the problems of
low-income families.
Rather, those who cannot af
ford adequate medical care
should be taken care of by an ex
panded and more efficient
medic program. It must be
borne in mind that all Americans
would still pay the bill with
socialized medicine—simply in
a less direct and more expensive
manner.
Even some liberals have rec
ognized the problems inherent
with such monumental gov
ernmental interference with the
economy. Sen. Abraham
Ribicoff (D-Conn.) has noted that
"imposing a giant new federal
health program would only dis
illusion many by promising
more than it can deliver."
We simply do not have the
administrative capacity to ad
minister and to pay claims for
over 200 million Americans,
deal with 7000 hospitals, over
320,000 doctors and the count
less other segments of the health
industry.
Nor does our health care sys
tem have the capacity to deliver
all the increased demand for ser
vices which fully federalized na
tional health insurance would
induce."
The American public should
be careful before plunging over
the precipice of socialized
medicine. Paying more for less
may be a Utopian paradise to
some, but it certainly won't heal
the injured and cure the sick.

Many of the advocates of na
tional health insurance and total
socialized medicine seem to
have become prisoners of their
own rhetoric. Leonard Wood
cock, president of the United
Auto Workers, is reported to
have said that "if the bill on na
tional health insurance is
enacted, no American ever again
would have to pay a doctor's bill
or a hospital bill."
One can only wonder who he
thinks would—the Arab sheiks?
Unfortunately, "laundering the
money we pay through
Washington is simply a
different—and more
expensive—way to pay our hos
pital or doctor's bills" (Milton
Friedman).
There is simply no free
lunch—the national cost of
health care is not likely to de
crease, or even stabilize, with the
advent of socialized medicine
(Martin Feldstein, testimony to
the Senate Subcommittee on
Health), since the rise in health
cost is due to a plethora of diffe
rent factors.
Malpractice suits and un
necessary preventive medicine,
the geometric growth in
technology with the concomit
ant increase in demand for skil
led workers, and the vulnerabil
ity of the health field to inflation
because of a high labor content
and low productivity potential
are some of them (Walter
McNerny, president, Blue Cross
Association).
There are two additional factors,
which socialized medicine can
only serve to intensify. Overbur
densome government regula
tions are currently a prime cause
of increased costs. Some hospi
tals must cope with up to 1000
conflicting regulations enforced
by up to 100 overlapping, and
sometimes conflicting, agencies.
For example, the Florida Hos
pital Association estimated that
it cost its members $50 million to
comply with one particular
safety statute.
Government administration
would only exacerbate the
foregoing problems, and it
would be less economical, ac
cording to studies done by the
General Accounting Office. In
Great Britain, the National
Health Service is operated
through three separate adminis
trative agencies; a recent reor
ganization left five separate
layers of bureaucracy. There are
an endless number of boards,
committees and regional au
thorities. In fact, as much as 30
per cent of the cost of the entire

system goes to administrative
costs.
However, the factor which
would increase costs the most is
simply the increased demand on
the system. Political beliefs do
not repeal economic forces; by
destroying the cash nexus bet
ween demand and supply, one
unleashes a limitless demand.
The good would be "free," so
there would be no reason not to
demand it, yet the supply is still
limited.
The United States has suffered
this to a certain extent, because
Americans pay less than one
tenth of their hospital bills and
one-third of their physician's
fees directly.

The increased demand has re
sulted in near-chaos for Great
Britain. The patient must queue
up for an appointment with the
general practitioner (GP), which
lasts an average of 6V2 minutes.
His name is then added to a
waiting list and it may be weeks
or even months before he can see
a consultant for the first time.
For "non-urgent" operations
one may wait for months or years
to get a bed (there have been rare
cases of six-year waits). Tonsil
lectomies may take up to six
months; a hernia, two years; var
icose veins or hemorrhoids, at
least two years. At any one time
there are from 500,000 to
700,000 people waiting for oper
ations or treatment in hospitals.
Over two-thirds of the British
hospitals were built before 1890.
Shortages of equipment and
supplies are rife. For example, at
the Kingston-on-Thames Hospi
tal in Surrey, emergency opera
tions have had to be delayed
while doctors and nurses
searched for clean and usable li
nens. The hospital has also re
peatedly run out of surgical
gowns and bed linens.
The inevitable result Is that
"people who are well
connected, hypochondriacs
with time on their hands and the
simply persisten get an undue
share" (Friedman). In Britain,
older patients with shorter life

expectancies are passed over for
younger, and thus more "hope
ful" cases. One doctor has noted
that "if the very sick have not
died as a result of the long lists of
people waiting for treatment, it's
also true that the not-so-sick
have remained ill for longer or
suffered from remediable condi
tions for longer."

not repeal economic forces; by
destroying the cash nexus bet
ween demand and supply, one
unleashes a limitless demand.
The good would be "free," so
there would be no reason not to
demand it, yet the supply is still
limited.
The United States has suffered
this to a certain extent, because
Americans pay less than one
tenth of their hospital bills and
one-third of their physician's
fees directly.

The increased demand has re
sulted in near-chaos for Great
Britain. The patient must queue
up for an appointment with the
general practitioner (GP), which
lasts an average of 6V2 minutes.
His name is then added to a
waiting list and it may be weeks
or even months before he can see
a consultant for the first time.
For "non-urgent" operations
one may wait for months or years
to get a bed (there have been rare
cases of six-year waits). Tonsil
lectomies may take up to six
months; a hernia, two years; var
icose veins or hemorrhoids, at
least two years. At any one time
there are from 500,000 to
700,000 people waiting for oper
ations or treatment in hospitals.
Over two-thirds of the British
hospitals were built before 1890.
Shortages of equipment and
supplies are rife. For example, at
the Kingston-on-Thames Hospi
tal in Surrey, emergency opera
tions have had to be delayed
while doctors and nurses
searched for clean and usable li
nens. The hospital has also re
peatedly run out of surgical
gowns and bed linens.
The inevitable result Is that
"people who are well
connected, hypochondriacs
with time on their hands and the
simply persisten get an undue
share" (Friedman). In Britain,
older patients with shorter life

expectancies are passed over for
younger, and thus more "hope
ful" cases. One doctor has noted
that "if the very sick have not
died as a result of the long lists of
people waiting for treatment, it's
also true that the not-so-sick
have remained ill for longer or
suffered from remediable condi
tions for longer."
Neither patients nor doctors
have been satisfied with the sys
tem. Sincrf 1966 the equivalent
of one-third of the annual output
of Britain's medical schools have
been emigrating each year. Pri
vate hospitals are burgeoning
and over 2.5 million Britons now
belong to private insurance
plans—an increase of 300,000
over the past four years.
No, socialized medicine is not
the route to go; the high costs of
medical care would only be
exacerbated by government con
trol and must be dealt with in
other ways. Since 90 per cent of
Americans subscribe to private
health insurance, which is var
ied enough to meet diverse
needs, the imposition of a stan
dardized system by the govern
ment is not the most effective
way to meet the problems of
low-income families.
Rather, those who cannot af
ford adequate medical care
should be taken care of by an ex
panded and more efficient
medic program. It must be
borne in mind that all Americans
would still pay the bill with
socialized medicine—simply in
a less direct and more expensive
manner.
Even some liberals have rec
ognized the problems inherent
with such monumental gov
ernmental interference with the
economy. Sen. Abraham
Ribicoff (D-Conn.) has noted that
"imposing a giant new federal
health program would only dis
illusion many by promising
more than it can deliver."
We simply do not have the
administrative capacity to ad
minister and to pay claims for
over 200 million Americans,
deal with 7000 hospitals, over
320,000 doctors and the count
less other segments of the health
industry.
Nor does our health care sys
tem have the capacity to deliver
all the increased demand for ser
vices which fully federalized na
tional health insurance would
induce."
The American public should
be careful before plunging over
the precipice of socialized
medicine. Paying more for less
may be a Utopian paradise to
some, but it certainly won't heal
the injured and cure the sick.

Many of the advocates of na
tional health insurance and total
socialized medicine seem to
have become prisoners of their
own rhetoric. Leonard Wood
cock, president of the United
Auto Workers, is reported to
have said that "if the bill on na
tional health insurance is
enacted, no American ever again
would have to pay a doctor's bill
or a hospital bill."
One can only wonder who he
thinks would—the Arab sheiks?
Unfortunately, "laundering the
money we pay through
Washington is simply a
different—and more
expensive—way to pay our hos
pital or doctor's bills" (Milton
Friedman).
There is simply no free
lunch—the national cost of
health care is not likely to de
crease, or even stabilize, with the
advent of socialized medicine
(Martin Feldstein, testimony to
the Senate Subcommittee on
Health), since the rise in health
cost is due to a plethora of diffe
rent factors.
Malpractice suits and un
necessary preventive medicine,
the geometric growth in
technology with the concomit
ant increase in demand for skil
led workers, and the vulnerabil
ity of the health field to inflation
because of a high labor content
and low productivity potential
are some of them (Walter
McNerny, president, Blue Cross
Association).
There are two additional factors,
which socialized medicine can
only serve to intensify. Overbur
densome government regula
tions are currently a prime cause
of increased costs. Some hospi
tals must cope with up to 1000
conflicting regulations enforced
by up to 100 overlapping, and
sometimes conflicting, agencies.
For example, the Florida Hos
pital Association estimated that
it cost its members $50 million to
comply with one particular
safety statute.
Government administration
would only exacerbate the
foregoing problems, and it
would be less economical, ac
cording to studies done by the
General Accounting Office. In
Great Britain, the National
Health Service is operated
through three separate adminis
trative agencies; a recent reor
ganization left five separate
layers of bureaucracy. There are
an endless number of boards,
committees and regional au
thorities. In fact, as much as 30
per cent of the cost of the entire

system goes to administrative
costs.
However, the factor which
would increase costs the most is
simply the increased demand on
the system. Political beliefs do
not repeal economic forces; by
destroying the cash nexus bet
ween demand and supply, one
unleashes a limitless demand.
