# Indoctrination in liberal arts
## 
### 
David Eh re nfeld

Indoctrination may be defined
as the hypnotic inability to think
about certain topics, which often
results from a person's inability
to cope with pressure tactics
from his peers. "Pressure tac
tics" refers to abusive kinds of
persuasion, such as shouting,
ridicule, confusing rationaliza
tions and the "silent treatment."
The avowed goal of a liberal
arts education is to enable stu
dents to look at things from
many points of view. In theory,
indoctrination is the opposite of
what a liberal arts education
should be. In practice, discus
sions of close-mindedness or in
doctrination are almost invari
ably avoided. This leaves stu
dents vulnerable to pressure tac
tics.
If indoctrination were discus
sed, it would give students a de
fense against pressure tactics
and add a great deal of relevance
to a liberal arts education. How
ever, if indoctrination is to be
discussed, there are some prob

lems to be confronted.
The first problem is that such
discussions are disturbing. The
most effective method for de
monstrating indoctrination is to
use the Socratic form of debate.
That is, a series of questions are
asked, which would lead to a
confrontation with an opposing
point of view.
The shocking result of such
experiments is that some ques
tions can be so disturbing for a
person that he will be unable to
remember them long enough to
respond. Because of this prob
lem, we have many cultural
myths which are used as excuses
for evading questions. One of
these myths is the notion of
"loaded questions."
Another problem is that many
(but not all) of the values which
people cherish the most are ac
quired through indoctrination.
History is full of examples of
crazy things that people have be
lieved and even died for because
they lacked the ability to think

about obvious criticisms of their
positions—for example, the
Crusades, the Inquisition, the
willingness ofGermans to die for
Hitler, our involvement in Viet
nam and the nonsense in Ireland
and the Middle East today.
A great many religious values
are acquired through indoctrina
tion.
Many values which people
cherish and which look bad from
opposing points of view are also
bad by the standards of the
people who say they hold the
values.
For example, if one went to
Ireland and questioned some ter
rorists, it is reasonable to expect
to find that they hold the value of
some form of the golden rule.
Further questioning would
probably reveal that they have
considerable difficulty in dis
cussing the conflict between the
golden rule and the values
which drive them to violence.
They have been blinded by their
own peer group pressure.

As a very brief introduction,
consider the conflicts in our cul
ture, associated with the follow
ing words: freedom, justice,
morality, liberty, truth, repres
sion, socialism, humility, crea
tion, rights, suppression, faith,
sin, oppression, obligation, dic
tatorship of the proletariat,
exploitation, existence of a God.
attitudes toward poverty, ra
cism.
Anyone wishing to say he is
competent to engage in a sys
tematic study of values is soon
faced with some vexing prob
lems.
Those who want a great deal
more relevance in liberal arts
education should demand to
have discussions of open and
close-mindedness. The table
above provides ample oppor
tunities for those who want to
experiment with the Socratic
method as a means of illustrating
blindness or indoctrination.

Indoctrination may be defined
as the hypnotic inability to think
about certain topics, which often
results from a person's inability
to cope with pressure tactics
from his peers. "Pressure tac
tics" refers to abusive kinds of
persuasion, such as shouting,
ridicule, confusing rationaliza
tions and the "silent treatment."
The avowed goal of a liberal
arts education is to enable stu
dents to look at things from
many points of view. In theory,
indoctrination is the opposite of
what a liberal arts education
should be. In practice, discus
sions of close-mindedness or in
doctrination are almost invari
ably avoided. This leaves stu
dents vulnerable to pressure tac
tics.
If indoctrination were discus
sed, it would give students a de
fense against pressure tactics
and add a great deal of relevance
to a liberal arts education. How
ever, if indoctrination is to be
discussed, there are some prob

lems to be confronted.
The first problem is that such
discussions are disturbing. The
most effective method for de
monstrating indoctrination is to
use the Socratic form of debate.
That is, a series of questions are
asked, which would lead to a
confrontation with an opposing
point of view.
The shocking result of such
experiments is that some ques
tions can be so disturbing for a
person that he will be unable to
remember them long enough to
respond. Because of this prob
lem, we have many cultural
myths which are used as excuses
for evading questions. One of
these myths is the notion of
"loaded questions."
Another problem is that many
(but not all) of the values which
people cherish the most are ac
quired through indoctrination.
History is full of examples of
crazy things that people have be
lieved and even died for because
they lacked the ability to think

about obvious criticisms of their
positions—for example, the
Crusades, the Inquisition, the
willingness ofGermans to die for
Hitler, our involvement in Viet
nam and the nonsense in Ireland
and the Middle East today.
A great many religious values
are acquired through indoctrina
tion.
Many values which people
cherish and which look bad from
opposing points of view are also
bad by the standards of the
people who say they hold the
values.
For example, if one went to
Ireland and questioned some ter
rorists, it is reasonable to expect
to find that they hold the value of
some form of the golden rule.
Further questioning would
probably reveal that they have
considerable difficulty in dis
cussing the conflict between the
golden rule and the values
which drive them to violence.
They have been blinded by their
own peer group pressure.

As a very brief introduction,
consider the conflicts in our cul
ture, associated with the follow
ing words: freedom, justice,
morality, liberty, truth, repres
sion, socialism, humility, crea
tion, rights, suppression, faith,
sin, oppression, obligation, dic
tatorship of the proletariat,
exploitation, existence of a God.
