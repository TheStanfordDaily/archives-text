Washington (AP) — Virtually till
fluorocarbon aerosol sprays will dis
appear from the American market in
less than two years it a ban proposed
l>\ the government yesterday becomes
Ihw.
Three federal agencies, in an unpre
cedented joint announcement. said the
ban is necessary because the
flnorocarbons can damage the earth's
o/one layer, which protects life on
earth from the potentially skin
cancer-causing ultraviolet ravs of thq
sun.
The Council on Atmospheric Sci
ences. an industry group, said the
mandatory phaseout proposal would
require study, but a spokesman denied
the ban would save consumers money
as the government claimed.
If put into effect, the ban would
eliminate nearly 700 million pres
surized containers used in spraying
deodorants, pesticides, hair sprays, air
•fresheners and various household
cleaners, according to industry fi
gures.
Still available
However, it does not moan aerosols
would no longer be available. The in
dustry group said fluorocarbon use in
aerosols has been declining in recent
years and estimated less than ;ui per
cent of the 2.:< billion aerosols pro
duced in 197 0 were powered bv
flnorocarbons.
Johnson Wax. for example, an
nounced last year that it had elimi
nated flnorocarbons from all of its
aerosol products, including furniture
polishes, insecticides and repellants
and numerous household cleaners.
Most spray paints now use hydrocar
bons lor propellants.
The proposed regulations issued
yesterday will be subject to public
hearings and comment for the next HO
days. A decision on whether to go
ahead with the ban will be made after
the comment period ends.
Exempted
A handful of products classified as
essential would he exempted from the
ban. including contraceptive vaginal
foams, inhalers used by asthma suffer
ers. cytology fixatives used in cancer
diagnosis, a mine safety warning de
vice. ejectors used to remove plastics
from molds and flying insect sprays
used on airplanes and in commercial
tood handling areas.
Covernment- spokesmen said the
exempt products make up only two or
three per cent of the market.
Some products, such as aerosol
foghorns used on boats, aren't affected
