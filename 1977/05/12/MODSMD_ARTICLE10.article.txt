Hung-Po Chao

I, a student from Taiwan, and
many of my fellow students were
very disturbed by a series of re
ports about Chinese students at
Stanford (Daily, April 27-29) by
Kurt Cobb. It was not only be
cause those reports were full of
mistakes, rumors, unconfirmed
information and rooted in bias,
but because they also obviously
and more importantly exposed
an intention to arouse suspicion
among our Chinese students and
disturb the friendship and unity
among us.
Such unconfirmed reports
should not be published in the
reputable Daily whenonlybased
upon anonymous interviews of
an undisclosed number of indi
viduals.
Survey
A letter sponsored by two
Taiwanese students and en
dorsed by 82 others (Daily, Feb.
25) showed disagreement with
an article written by Foldy (Jan.
13 Daily).
The last paragraph of that let
ter states: "Here I endorse this
article to show my support of the
author's point of view. This ac
tion is based on my own judg
ment and willingness."
With that understanding 1 en
dorsed the letter with my signa
ture.
Later, 1 received a survey ques
tionnaire from the Daily, which
read as follows:
"Several weeks ago your sig
nature appeared on a letter spon
sored by two Chinese students,
Jer-hong Lin and Shiuang-chur
Sheng. The letter was sub
sequently published in the Daily
on Feb. 25. This is a survey con
cerning that letter being con
ducted by the Daily. If you wish
to respond, please follow the in
structions given below careful lv:
1) Circle yes or no for each
question.
2) You do not need to sign
your name to this survey.
3) Please return the survey
immediately to the Daily in the
self-addressed metered en
velope provided.
Questions
1. Did you in fact sign the letter
mentioned above?
2. Are you a citizen of the Repub
lic of China?
3. Do you agree that all Chinese
students "can travel freely in
and out of Taiwan?"
4. Do you believe that if you
voice criticism of your gov
ernment, you will he reported
to the government by some
other Chinese students at
Stanford?
5. Do you agree that amont the
Chinese students at Stanford
everybody can talk freely in
open conversation without
fear of reprisals by t he Chinese
government"?
6. Were you told that something

might happen to you or your
relatives if you did not sign the
letter?
7. Kven if you were not told
explicitly, were you af raid t hat
something might happen to
you or your relatives if you did
not sign the letter?"
Question 6. in a more approp
riate and unbiased form, seems
to be asking, "Did you sign the
letter based on your own judg
ment and willingness?"
Obvious agreement
Obviously, this was my ag
reement when I signed the letter.
All the other questions asked for
student's opinions instead of
concrete information or facts to
support their opinions.
Personal opinions can easily
be changed over time. Facing
certain yes-no questions, one
might quite possibly reply yes
this time for some reason, but
reply no next time for another
reason.
Not knowing the reasons be
hind the questionnaire, how
would one know the appropriate
reply? Usually opinions cannot
be well expressed, therefore, it
seems inappropriate to reveal
opinions as facts to readers and
to ask them to rely on their own
interpretations.
Furthermore question 6 and 7
are badly-phrased with implicit
implication that the authors of
the letter forced others to en
dorse the letter.
Because of the inappropriat
ness of the survey, many ques
tionable points can be raised.
Why didn't the author of the re
ports reveal the statistics of each
question? Why was it conducted
anonymously?
Assumptions
I lowever, if we want to draw a
conceivable implication from
the results of the survey shown
in the reports, we have to make
an assumption about those who
signed the letter but didn't re
spond to the survey.
We can reasonably assume
their replies to be silent ap
proval. that is to say, "I don't
show any other different opin
ions from what 1 have shown ear
lier."
In this case this leaves three
persons signed the letter based
on their own judgment and wil
lingness but disagreed with
parts of the letter, and there are
two respondents who said they
feared reprisals.
The other 79 persons sup
ported the statements made in
the letter. In summary, quite
evidently the seeking of en
dorsement for the letter was not
conducted under any kind of
pressure while contrarily, the
anonymous survey was con
ducted with several iresponsible
behaviors.

1) Circle yes or no for each
question.
2) You do not need to sign
your name to this survey.
3) Please return the survey
immediately to the Daily in the
self-addressed metered en
velope provided.
Questions
1. Did you in fact sign the letter
mentioned above?
2. Are you a citizen of the Repub
lic of China?
3. Do you agree that all Chinese
students "can travel freely in
and out of Taiwan?"
4. Do you believe that if you
voice criticism of your gov
ernment, you will he reported
to the government by some
other Chinese students at
Stanford?
5. Do you agree that amont the
Chinese students at Stanford
everybody can talk freely in
open conversation without
fear of reprisals by t he Chinese
government"?
6. Were you told that something

might happen to you or your
relatives if you did not sign the
letter?
7. Kven if you were not told
explicitly, were you af raid t hat
something might happen to
you or your relatives if you did
not sign the letter?"
Question 6. in a more approp
riate and unbiased form, seems
to be asking, "Did you sign the
letter based on your own judg
ment and willingness?"
Obvious agreement
Obviously, this was my ag
reement when I signed the letter.
All the other questions asked for
student's opinions instead of
concrete information or facts to
support their opinions.
Personal opinions can easily
be changed over time. Facing
certain yes-no questions, one
might quite possibly reply yes
this time for some reason, but
reply no next time for another
reason.
Not knowing the reasons be
hind the questionnaire, how
would one know the appropriate
reply? Usually opinions cannot
be well expressed, therefore, it
seems inappropriate to reveal
opinions as facts to readers and
to ask them to rely on their own
interpretations.
Furthermore question 6 and 7
are badly-phrased with implicit
implication that the authors of
the letter forced others to en
dorse the letter.
Because of the inappropriat
ness of the survey, many ques
tionable points can be raised.
Why didn't the author of the re
ports reveal the statistics of each
question? Why was it conducted
anonymously?
Assumptions
I lowever, if we want to draw a
conceivable implication from
the results of the survey shown
in the reports, we have to make
an assumption about those who
signed the letter but didn't re
spond to the survey.
We can reasonably assume
their replies to be silent ap
proval. that is to say, "I don't
show any other different opin
ions from what 1 have shown ear
lier."
In this case this leaves three
persons signed the letter based
on their own judgment and wil
lingness but disagreed with
parts of the letter, and there are
two respondents who said they
feared reprisals.
The other 79 persons sup
ported the statements made in
the letter. In summary, quite
evidently the seeking of en
dorsement for the letter was not
conducted under any kind of
pressure while contrarily, the
anonymous survey was con
ducted with several iresponsible
behaviors.

I, a student from Taiwan, and
many of my fellow students were
very disturbed by a series of re
ports about Chinese students at
Stanford (Daily, April 27-29) by
Kurt Cobb. It was not only be
cause those reports were full of
mistakes, rumors, unconfirmed
information and rooted in bias,
but because they also obviously
and more importantly exposed
an intention to arouse suspicion
among our Chinese students and
disturb the friendship and unity
among us.
Such unconfirmed reports
should not be published in the
reputable Daily whenonlybased
upon anonymous interviews of
an undisclosed number of indi

this time for some reason, but
reply no next time for another
reason.
Not knowing the reasons be
hind the questionnaire, how
would one know the appropriate
reply? Usually opinions cannot
be well expressed, therefore, it
seems inappropriate to reveal
opinions as facts to readers and
to ask them to rely on their own
interpretations.
Furthermore question 6 and 7
are badly-phrased with implicit
implication that the authors of
the letter forced others to en
dorse the letter.
Because of the inappropriat
ness of the survey, many ques
tionable points can be raised.
Why didn't the author of the re
ports reveal the statistics of each
question? Why was it conducted
anonymously?
Assumptions
I lowever, if we want to draw a
conceivable implication from
the results of the survey shown
in the reports, we have to make
an assumption about those who
signed the letter but didn't re
spond to the survey.
We can reasonably assume
their replies to be silent ap
proval. that is to say, "I don't
show any other different opin
ions from what 1 have shown ear
lier."
In this case this leaves three
persons signed the letter based
on their own judgment and wil
lingness but disagreed with
parts of the letter, and there are
two respondents who said they
feared reprisals.
The other 79 persons sup
ported the statements made in
the letter. In summary, quite
evidently the seeking of en
dorsement for the letter was not
conducted under any kind of
pressure while contrarily, the
anonymous survey was con
ducted with several iresponsible
behaviors.
