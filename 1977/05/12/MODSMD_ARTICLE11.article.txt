With regard to Hon Barton's
comments on President Jimmy
Carter's energy plan (Daily .Ap
ril 28), I find discouraging his
rather simple-minded accep
tance of the "free market" as
regulator. Milton Friedman's
dislike of any additional gov
ernment action is to be expected,
just as Friedman would prefer to
remove minimum wages, V.A.
guarantee mortgages, national
parks, publicly-operated toll
roads, graduated income tax.
government subsidy of voca
tional schooling, among other
things.
It's unfortunate that Barton, at

least, wasn't able to look beyond
the simplistic "free market"
formula to realize some of the
more obvious problems it en
tails.
For example: (1) Allowing the
price of gas to rise to "what the
market will bear" will dispro
portionately hurt those with
small incomes who have to
commute.
(2) Allowing the market price
to rise to its highest level might
have a stimulating effect on pro
duction. However, perhaps we
should think twice about
stimulating the production of
polluting energy forms rather

than emphasizing restricted
consumption and alternative,
though not necessarily "profita
ble," energy sources.
(3) It isn't clear that allowing
prices to rise does stimulate oil
production. In 1975. Congress
and the Ford Administration
compromised on a plan whereby
over a two year period the prices
of old and new oil would move
up until they were level with
world market oil prices. By
mid-1976, however, consump
tion had risen and the per cent of
imported oil had reached a new
high.
Clearly, the simplistic "free

market" approach is insufficient
to deal with the complexities of
the modern economy. Free mar
ket might work were monopolis
tic forces not present. This situa
tion does not apply for many im
portant industries, including oil
companies, in 20th Century
America. It is very consoling to
speak up for the "basic Ameri
can right of individual free
dom." Unfortunately, we have a
situation in which the indi
vidual American has very little
say about oil prices or produc
tion.
