# Dean of women loses job, sues for sex discrimination

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — A local
college's dean of women, angry
about losing her job to a man, has
filed a lawsuit that looms as a
classic battle of the sexes.
Martha Hooper contends
school administrators at El
Camino College are giving the
job to Dean of Men Henry kirk
because of sex discrimination.
Hut the college's board of trus
tees savs it's just part of a reor
ganization that will save
$221,000 by cutting three ad
ministrative positions — one by
combining kirk's and Hooper's
jobs into a single dean of student
affairs. Hooper accepted a post
as teacher.
"All one has to do is look at the
small number of women in ad
ministrative position," Hooper
said. "My situation is only the
latest episode in a continuous
pattern of failure on the part of
the administration and the board
of trustees to take affirmative ac
tion to employ women and
blacks."
One black
Hooper, who is white and one
of only three female adminis
trators at El (-amino, said the col
lege also has only one black ad
ministrator, a male.
She has filed u sex discrimina
tion suit with the federal
Employment Opportunities
Commission seeking a reversal
of the college's decision. She
also has asked the federal De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare to stop funding the
two-year college.
She contends there was a lack
of open competition for the
dean's job.
The school's dean of person
nel, a woman, represents the
administration's side in denying
Hooper's accusations.

"We contend the job was not a
new one, thus not requiring
open competition for it," said
kathy Schwarz. "We felt to have
picked her over the person to
whom the job went would have
opened the college to a charge of
reverse discrimination."
Hooper said she was offered
her choice of either stepping
down to become a counselor or a
teacher and chose the latter,
even though it meant losing
$10,000 a year in salary. As a
dean, she earned $34,000, and as
a full-time professor she will
draw $24,000 annually.
Schwarz said kirk was chosen
because he has more advanced
academic qualifications and
longer service with the district.
More education
kirk holds a doctorate in edu
cation, compared to Hooper's

master's degree, and has been
with the district for seven years,
three more than she.
Hut Hooper says kirk's educa
tional background is not fitted to
the position.
"His doctorate in education is
something that is irrelevant to
the position," she said. "What
they should have compared was
the field of study in the master's
degree. His was in student ser
vices, mine in psychology and
counseling. I think mine is more
suited to the position.
"Even more important, I think
l have done a better job than he
has in our respective positions.
But of course, 1 was not given the
opportunity to prove that in
open competition for the job,"
she said.
kirk was out of town and un
available for comment.
