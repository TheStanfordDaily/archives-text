### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Several hundred University of Southern
California political science students had a substitute teacher yester
day His name was Gerald Ford and he came to tell them "a little bit
about how government works."
The former president opened his three-day teaching visit to DSC
with a short lecture and then answered questions, but refused to
comment on David Frost's televised interviews with Richard Nixon.
Ford did say, however, that he would pardon Nixon if he had to do
it over again and conditions were the same as in September 1974.
Ford said that until the pardon, he was spending about 25 per cent of
his time on Watergate-related business
The questions from students were generally friendly, but one
asked Ford if he thought that doing nothing as a member of the
House of Representatives led to his selection as vice president after
Spiro Agnew resigned.
"Well," said Ford, "I don't agree with your basic assumption that I
was a member of Congress who didn't do anything."
He said he believed he was appointed vice president because
"over the period of 25 years in Congress I had the respect of both
Democrats and Republicans."
Another student asked if Ford, a member of the Warren Commis
sion, believed the commission did a good job of investigating the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
"I think we came to the right answers," Ford said. "I've seen no
evidence that would change my mind."
In his lecture Ford told students there were three major problems
when he took office — a rising crime rate, a rapid growth in federal
spending and a declining percentage of spending on defense.
He said the new overhaul of the federal criminal statutes is "long
overdue" and includes his recommendation that there be mandatory
sentences for major crimes.
