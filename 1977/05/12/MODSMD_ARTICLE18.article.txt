Dear Duca,
My roommate has stinking fee t which smell so had I am una hie to
stay in the room when his shoes are off and I have to bury my head
while lulling asleep. How can I tactfully approach him with the
problem, and what can one suggest to help him correct his smelly
feet?
Mr. Noseworthy
Dear Noseworthy,
I can quite understand that you do not wish to hurt your room
mate's feelings, still how can you go about it without calling a spade
a spade? So this is my advice: broach the subject casually in a
friendly manner, inventing that you yourself have once been made
aware of the fact you were being offensive to others because of 8.0.
and that you are ever grateful to the friend who had courageously
drawn your attention to it.
Should he not get the message then be blunt, tell the truth, adding
that if he does not correct himself, you will be forced to ask for
another roommate.
DUCA
