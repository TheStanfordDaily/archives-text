# $40 million worth collected
## Flu vaccine to be stored 
### 
Atlanta (AP) â€” The nation's supply of swine flu
vaccine is a valuable resource anil it may be
stockpiled lor as long as 10 years, the national
Center lor Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday.
About BH million doses, worth $40 million, have
been collected by the states. Public health officials
are trying to determine how to store the vaccine,
said Dr. ). Donald Millar, director of the CDC's
Bureau of State Services.
final recommendations are expected in about a
month.
"Such vaccine usually is good for 18 mouths,
but with proper refrigeration it can be kept for up
to 10 years," Millar said in an interview.
The vaccine is part of the $ 1 5 million program
voted by Congress during the administration of
President Gerald Ford and called "the tragedy of
the past year" by Health, Education and Welfare
Secretary Joseph Califano.
Most ol the vaccine is being held by the states
and the question, Millar said, is: Who will control
it in the end?
"We have suggested two alternatives," he said.
"First, central stockpiling, federally managed.
Second, each state would stockpile it under their
management.
"There are advantages to the central stockpiling
plan because it would be easier to care for. Hut if
the states do it, it will be easier to distribute in the
event of an emergency."
Millar said plans now are for the vaccine to be

used only in case ot another swine flu scare, which
appears unlikely.
However, the military will use some of the
stockpiled vaccine for its personnel next year, he
said.
Millar said the swine flu vaccine, if maintained
under refrigeration, would he effective against a
new flu virus as long as it is closely related to
A-Victoria or A-New Jersey swine flu.
"It might he that we could see a new pandemic
strain in the next few yearsand it would be nogood
for that," he said. "But it is highly unlikely
A-Victoria will cause additional major outbreaks.
It's been around for two years."
A-Victoria was the predominant A-virus in the
United States last winter. There also were out
breaks of H-virus, which attacks mostly children.
A strain called A-Texas appeared at an air base
in Texas in January and later was identified in
Colorado and Alaska. The CDC' says this could be
the predominant strain of any A-virus outbreak
next winter.
The swine flu vaccination program was banned
Dec. 16 when an apparent link between the vac
cine and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare but occa
sionally fatal form of paralysis, was discovered.
The program later was resumed but public re
sponse was poor.
The program was developed after an outbreak of
the virus at Ft. Dix, N.J., last year, which infected
about 500 recruits, killing one.
