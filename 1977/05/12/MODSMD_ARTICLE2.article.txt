# History of science program proposed
## Two faculty appointments expected by autumn '79 
### Sallie Bray 
The I 'niversitv may soon have a his
tory of science program, according to
Humanities and Sciences Dean Halsev
Kovden.
"We're planning to have one posi
tion in ancient, medieval and renais
sance science.,mil another in 19thand
2()th century physics." he said.
The target date tor filling these posi
tions is the fall ot IH7H. said Koyden.
"Whether we meet this date will de
pend on how organized and industri
ous we are."
A committee appointed by Koyden
last fall to "study the possibility ot
having a modest program in the his
tory of science" wil I make the two ap
pointments. said Koyden.
The goals of the history of science
program would be two-fold, according
to Koyden: 1) "to organize courses di
rected toward general students, as well

as more specialized courses tor scien
tists and engineers." and 2) to have
"first quality scholarship carried on in
these small groups."
'Scientific culture'
"One characteristic of western cul
ture is that it's a scientific culture."
said Philosophy Prof. Lan Hacking, a
member of the History of Science
Committee. "We hope th.it people
from all disciplines will participate in
the History of science program."
The members ot the committee be
sides I lacking are Koyden. Philosophy
Prof. Patrick Suppes. History Prof.
Peter Paret, Asst. History Prof. Clay
Carson. Physics Prof. Sandv Fetter.

Hansen Laboratories Adjunct Prof.
Francis Everitt and Aeronautical En
gineering Prof. Walter Vincenti.
"We're now advertising a hit abroad
and in the U.S. for people to fill these
positions," Koyden said. "We're hav
ing people come out. some tor consult
ing. some for appointments."
According to Hacking, the commit
tee is "in a good position because I here
are lots of good people in history ol
science and not a lot ot jobs."
A program in the history ot science
has long been desired by t hi' School ol
Humanities and Sciences, said
Koyden. but funds have been lacking
for such a program;
"Fourteen years ago the University
was thinking more expansively: two
things we weren't doing which we
thought we ought tobedoing included
the establishment of a linguistics prog
ram. as well as one in the history ot
science." Koyden said.
Although the linguistics program is
"now flourishing." said Koyden. the
history of science program has been
hampered by the University's budget
equilibrium program.
"There have been a number of cuts,
but I have been able to save a few posi
tions which can be reallocated to meet
some ot the school's needs; one of
these is to be used in the area of the
history of science." he said.
Koyden said the availabil itv of a sec
ond position stems from a recent stud\
of the Physical Science program by the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies. This study was prompted by
the upcoming retirement of Alverez
Tostado on Aug. 31. 1977. he said.
Tostado has directed tlit? Physical
Science program since 1945.
Koyden explained that the Office ot
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
concluded it would not be necessary to
find a replacement for Tostado. The
office recommended that this free pos
ition be used for the history of science.

Hoyden added.
According to Koyden. his committee
is not considering a history of science
department or major at present.
He said his committee recom
mended that appointments he made
jointly to the program and to an ap
propriate disciplinary department,
such as history, philosophy or one ot
the sciences.
Koyden also said undergraduates
could have the option ol pursuing in
dividually designed majors in the his
tory ot science.
"We are not envisioning a graduate
program." lie said.
Koyden said his committee has been
in especially "close touch with Ber
keley's historians ot science because
the program at Berkeley is similar to
the one being planned here.
The Berkeley program is relatively
small, said Koyden. while I larvard has
"quite a sizable department" and
UCI.A has "a larger program."
