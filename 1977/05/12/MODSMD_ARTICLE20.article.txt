# Louisville desegregation ruling causes controversy

### 
Louisville, ky. (AP) — Louis
ville, in the second year of a
school busing plan that divided
the community, is mired anew in
controversy over a judge's ruling
that first-graders will not be
bused.
U.S. Dist. Judge James Gordon
ruled late Tuesday that first
graders are exempt from his de
segregation plan. He ruled after
pleas from school officials who
argued first-graders are emo
tionally unprepared to he bused.
The Kentucky NAAGP yester
day criticized the ruling as polit
ically motivated, and Tom Ho
gan, a lawyer for plaintiffs in the
suit that led to the desegregation
plan, said he would appeal the
ruling.
Gordon, who two years ago
ordered busing of more than
20,000 of the city's then
projected enrollment of 134,000

students, said most first-grade
classes here are partially integ
rated now and statistics show
the youngsters are "subject to a
very high risk of failure."
He said busing would increase
the risk of failure among the
emotionally immature and "eas
ily excitable" first-graders.
School officials had told Gordon
that between 20 and 25 per cent
of first-graders do not complete
the work required and fail.
First graders were to have he
come part of the busing plan this
fall, and Gordon said if they were
not exempted, about 1500 blacks
and an equal number of whites
"would, of necessity, be trans
ported cross-district under the
plan of desegregation."
Aubrey Williams of the
NAACP criticized Gordon for
"being guided by political pres
sure" from the school hoard and

said, "1 see this as a continuing
effort ... to resist the laws and
the Constitution and the rights
and privileges and opportunities
of black people.
"There is no logical reason for
him to exempt first-graders," he
said. "In order for the races to
become compatible and be able
to live and understand each
other, it is very important that
white kids and black kids be ex
posed to each other as early in
age as possible.
"By exempting first-graders
with no logical reason, Judge
Gordon is not only frustrating
the purpose of the desegregation
efforts but is also denying these
children the opportunity to
overcome their prejudicies be
fore they become ingrained in
them. This is the only system
where first-graders have been
exempted."

"There is no logical reason for
him to exempt first-graders," he

white kids and black kids be ex

efforts but is also denying these
children the opportunity to
overcome their prejudicies be
fore they become ingrained in
them. This is the only system
where first-graders have been
exempted."
