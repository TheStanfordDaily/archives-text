There are more than 400 biog

massive eight-volume work bv

could a new study take up?
V'ed Mehta's Mahatma Gan
dhi and his Apostles attempts, in
the author's words, to "de
mythologize Gandhi and to cap

his influence on his followers
and the nature oft he influence of

Mehta's overall impression

The celibacy phase of Gan

highly sexed.
Mehta seems to concur with
Erik Erikson that Gandhi's sex
ual abstinence resulted from the
guilt-ridden sexual trauma of his
early youth (described by Gan
dhi in My Experiments with
Truth) and trom his credence in
the ancient Hindu belief that
conservation of semen is
strength. Gandhi's relation with
his women disciples was, in
deed. platonic. Mehta inter
viewed several. Some of them
now have new "gods."
Madeleine Slade. whom Gandhi
renamed Mirabehn. said, in a
lengthy conversation in Austria,
"the Gandhi chapter is closed; it
is Beethoven now." For the past
25 years she has been working

on a biography of Beethoven.

women-apostles. Dr. Sushila

Satya Sai Baba.
Mehta does not discuss the
many movements and persons
inspired indirectly by Gandhi's
teachings. Martin l.uther King
and Danilo Dolci are barely men

Mehta's skillful use of the pre
sent tense in narrating his inter
views. his vivid descriptions, his
elegant prose make the book en
grossing. He has written eight
other books including the
widely acclaimed Portrait of In
dia. Gandhi and his Apostles is
likely to become a classic in the
considerable Gandhian litera
