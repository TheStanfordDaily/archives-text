Powers of Mind is a delightfully witty
hook on human consciousness, taking up
such recondite questions as "What is re
ally real?" (lor those who think that the
question itself is not real, professional
philosophers have a vaguely insulting
name — naive realists.)
Powers of Mind focuses on some of the
outer reaches of human consciousness as
disclosed by recent research. Much of this
powers-of-mind search and research is
being done in growth centers and insti
tutes outside academic psychology de
partments. which seem to be pre-empted
by studies on the behavior and brain
physiology of laboratory rats and cats.
Adam Smith (pseudonym of Ceorge

new journalism, wrote the best-selling
The Money (iame. In keeping with new

journalism practice Adam Smith presents
saturation reporting in Powers of Mind.
He immersed himself in consciousness

years — experiencing and experiencing.

His immersion is quite literal when he
descends for several hours into a
sensory-deprivation tank filled with
water at body temperature, to experience
Sumadhi. Other experiences include
Transcendental Meditation. "the

Swami Kama, in <in experiment at the
Meninger Clinic in Kansas, alters his

(00 beats per minute in the space of one
beat. No pulse for 17 seconds! Ordinarily
such an atrial flutter leads to uncon

sciousness; instead, the swami goes on to
give a lecture on Biofeedback.
Yogi practice
Biofeedback, which means self-control
of one's internal processes at will, is a
long-standing practice amongst Indian
yogis. Their demonstrations have served
to seriously challenge Western's physiol
ogy's concept of autonomic nervous pro
cesses. which by definition are supposed
to be beyond conscious control.
Also described in the book are experi

Sciences in New Delhi, where Drs. Anand

Ramanand Yogi during his stay in an air
tight box": the swami dropped his body
metabolism down to half its normal rate.
Powers of Mind is altogether superior.
It is well-researched, lucid, and often
hilarious. Enthusiastically recom

Yogi practice
Biofeedback, which means self-control
of one's internal processes at will, is a
long-standing practice amongst Indian
yogis. Their demonstrations have served
to seriously challenge Western's physiol
ogy's concept of autonomic nervous pro
cesses. which by definition are supposed
to be beyond conscious control.
Also described in the book are experi

Sciences in New Delhi, where Drs. Anand

Ramanand Yogi during his stay in an air

metabolism down to half its normal rate.
