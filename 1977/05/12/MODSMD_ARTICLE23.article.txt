The Pickle Family is coming
The Children's Center of the Stanford Community will be
sponsoring appearances by the Pickle Family Circus tomor
row through Sunday in the Stanford Playing Fields between
Serra and Churchill Streets.
The performances are a fundraising activity for the Chil
dren's Center, an organization that is controlled primarily by
the parents of the children who go there. In this respect, the
center is unique, said director Fran Roth. "All the income is
from parent fees. But Stanford does give us the buildings and
the grounds rent-free, and that's a tremendous help."
When the center needs modifications, fundraising is relied
upon, instead of constantly having to ask the parents for more
and more money, said Roth.

The center is divided into two sections, one for "Little Kids"
(those under three years of age), and one for 'Big Kids"
(those three to five). "It was one of the first (day care centers)
on the peninsula to take children under the age of two-and-a
half," said Roth. Both Palo Alto and Menlo Park currently have
centers that do take children that young, "but we were the
first," she said.
Shows will be tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday
at noon and 3 p.m. Sunday morning there will also be a circus
"workshop" that will teach tightrope walking, juggling, "clown
ing," etc. And both days there will be a midway with fun and
games. Said parent Leanne Hull, "It should be fun, for
grown-ups as well as children."
