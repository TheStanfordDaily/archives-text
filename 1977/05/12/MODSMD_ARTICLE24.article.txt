# Whatever happened to...?
## Smothers grows grapes 
### 
Santa Cruz. (AP) â€” Dick
Smothers lias walked away from
the bright lights and applause
into the dust) world of irrigation
and sugar content as a wine
grape grower.
And he doesn't seem to mind
the change from adulation to
enology.
Since July, when Dick and
Tom Smothers broke up their
famous Irother act after more
than 17 yiars. he, his wife Linda,
and ther three children have
lived quietly on a ranch in the
Santa Cruz mountains, where
they are cultivating Lt acres of
premium white wines.
Me expects the first vintage of
Pinot Ghardonnay. Johannes

berg Kiesling and Sylvaner
Riesling to be bottled under his
label, Vine Hill Wine, after this
fall's harvest.
Smothers owns ii() acres of
land and plans to do some build
ing when the wines are ready to
drink.
"See that spot over there?" he
says, pointing to a hillside.
"Some day there will be a wine
tasting room and a restaurant
there."
Smothers, who always played
the straight man to his brother's
blunders, says he is not in
terested in talking about the de
mise of their controversial
Smothers brothers Comedy
Hour, which was axed from CHS
in the late '60s because of politi

cal controversy. The brothers
won $916,000 from the network
for breach of contract. "All ot
that is past history," he said.
Smothers has taught himself a
lot about wine-n\ak.lng and as
tutely discusses the economics
of the subject.
Is there a chance he'll return to
show biz? Brother Tom is ex
panding his performances into
movies as well as continuing
with a solo nightclub act. Hut
Dick is less ambitious. He hopes
to moderate a daytime talk or
game show, a responsibility
which would take up just a few
days a week and allow him to
help support the vineyard finan
cially.
