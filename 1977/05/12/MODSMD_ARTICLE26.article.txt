Seeing Robert Altman's i
Women can roughly lie com
pared to taking an Economics 51
mid-term cold turkey. In other
words, don't go in expecting to
understand it. There are rumors
that even Altman doesn't under
stand it. So don't feel bad when
its obscurity hits you square in
the face — it's not a typical
movie like The Towering Inferno
where there is a beginning and a
middle and an end. Altman is
too creative to indulge in such
o 1 d - fas hi on ed tech n i q u es.
Nevertheless, ,'i Women is a

peculiarly haunting and
memorable film. Scenes from it
stand out, pictures of its pro
tagonists remain in mind.
Somehow, Altman kept leading
the audience on a journey which
seemed to go somewhere, but
didn't at all.
Desert
The film is concerned with
three women who live in a
California desert community.
Willie (Janice Rule), the artist,
owns, with her husband Edgar,
the apartment house and bar
where Millie (Shelley Duvall)
and Pinky (Sissy Spacek) live
and socialize.
Their relationship is reminis
cent of Roman Polanski's The
Tenant, wherein a man so un

sure of his own identity and im
portance takes on the identity of
the suicidal woman who previ
ously occupied his apartment.
Altman takes this one step
further by populating ,'j Women
with mirrors and even a pair of
twins who work at the same
health spa as Millie and Pinky.
Pinky, fascinated by Millie,
slowly overtakes her personal
ity, emulating her, oblivious to
the fact that the rest of the world
ignores Millie with the rudeness
of an untipped taxi driver. Millie
is as oblivious to this as Pinky is.
Hut with a suicide attempt,
strange transformations occur.
Millie takes on Pinky's charac
teristics and Pinky — whose real
name, oddly enough, is Mildred

— sheds her previous personal
ity as easily as d snake sheds its
skin, stepping not into Millie's
true role, hut the role of the so
cial butterfly which Millie al
ways desired to have. Pinky is
better at being Millie than Millie
was.
Twins
Altman's treatment of the
fragility ot identity and the
common ground between

friends is exciting. The conver
sations between Millie and
Pinky about the twins, as well as
the entire film, explore the in
security of knowing ourselves,
and our grasping anything
which seems secure enough to
build a personality upon, as
I'inky does with Millie.
So much for the first three
quarters of.'} Women. In the last
quarter Willie begins playing a
more important role — that role

being completely obscure, what
with her eerie silence and eerier
murals. There are more rever
sions and transformations until
the seriousness of Altman's ad
mission comes through — that
the idea for 'i Women came to
him in a dream.
It comes to us in a similarly
misty state. As in a dream all re
lationships are hazy. And, as in a
dream, when you try to explain

it, it falls away from you defying
explanation. You only know one
thing about your dreams — that
you remember them despite
their intangible nature and that
you are curiously attached to
them. The same holds true for )
Women. It is an appropriate title,
for the film is like womankind —
beautiful, alluring and strangely
attractive because of the secrets
it retains, rather than those it re
veals.

It comes to us in a similarly
misty state. As in a dream all re
lationships are hazy. And, as in a
dream, when you try to explain

it, it falls away from you defying
explanation. You only know one

you remember them despite
their intangible nature and that
you are curiously attached to

Women. It is an appropriate title,

beautiful, alluring and strangely
attractive because of the secrets

Seeing Robert Altman's i
Women can roughly lie com
pared to taking an Economics 51
mid-term cold turkey. In other
words, don't go in expecting to
understand it. There are rumors
that even Altman doesn't under
stand it. So don't feel bad when
its obscurity hits you square in
the face — it's not a typical
movie like The Towering Inferno
where there is a beginning and a
middle and an end. Altman is
too creative to indulge in such
o 1 d - fas hi on ed tech n i q u es.
Nevertheless, ,'i Women is a

peculiarly haunting and
memorable film. Scenes from it
stand out, pictures of its pro
tagonists remain in mind.
Somehow, Altman kept leading
the audience on a journey which
seemed to go somewhere, but
didn't at all.
Desert
The film is concerned with
three women who live in a
California desert community.
Willie (Janice Rule), the artist,
owns, with her husband Edgar,
the apartment house and bar
where Millie (Shelley Duvall)
and Pinky (Sissy Spacek) live
and socialize.
Their relationship is reminis
cent of Roman Polanski's The
Tenant, wherein a man so un

sure of his own identity and im
portance takes on the identity of
the suicidal woman who previ
ously occupied his apartment.
Altman takes this one step
further by populating ,'j Women
with mirrors and even a pair of
twins who work at the same
health spa as Millie and Pinky.
Pinky, fascinated by Millie,
slowly overtakes her personal
ity, emulating her, oblivious to
the fact that the rest of the world
ignores Millie with the rudeness
of an untipped taxi driver. Millie
is as oblivious to this as Pinky is.
Hut with a suicide attempt,
strange transformations occur.
Millie takes on Pinky's charac
teristics and Pinky — whose real
name, oddly enough, is Mildred

— sheds her previous personal
ity as easily as d snake sheds its
skin, stepping not into Millie's
true role, hut the role of the so
cial butterfly which Millie al
ways desired to have. Pinky is
better at being Millie than Millie
was.
Twins
Altman's treatment of the
fragility ot identity and the
common ground between

friends is exciting. The conver
sations between Millie and
Pinky about the twins, as well as
the entire film, explore the in
security of knowing ourselves,
and our grasping anything
which seems secure enough to
build a personality upon, as
I'inky does with Millie.
So much for the first three
quarters of.'} Women. In the last
quarter Willie begins playing a
more important role — that role

being completely obscure, what
with her eerie silence and eerier
murals. There are more rever
sions and transformations until
the seriousness of Altman's ad
mission comes through — that
the idea for 'i Women came to
him in a dream.
