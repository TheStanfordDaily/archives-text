Brothers
A Warner Brothers release, produced by Ed
ward and Mildred Lewis, executive producer
Lee Savm. Directed by Arthur Barron. Written
by Lewis and Lewis Photographed by John
Morrill. Starring Bernie Casey, Vonetta McGee,
Ron O'Neal. MPAA rating: PG. Reviewed March

You'd think that the story of
the explosive life of George
Jackson and Angela Davis would
be a blockbuster on the silver sc
reen. A story torn from the head
lines! The brutal expose of
prison life! The indestructible

love that handcuffs and prison
bars couldn't contain! The in
spiring story of a fraternal love
that even death could not injure!
Yawn.
Much has been said against
the blaxploitation flicks lor pre
senting a biased view of the
world. But at least they provide a
catharsis. Brothers is much
worse. It offers nothing to either
the black audience or the white
audience. It exists in a limbo of
simplicity, slandering all its
characters with one
dimensional portraits. No won
der no real names were used.
The blacks are all oppressed

martyrs; the whites are a Simon
Legree gallery of sadistic evil. A
change of time and setting
would have made Brothers a
grade-B Civil War movie, some
thing like Boots without the
depth.
With its souffle-like texture of
emptiness, Brothers wafts like
an old newspaper covered with
old headlines from one focus to
another — first about David
Thomas (Bernie Casey) and his

brother, and then onto David and
Paula Jones (Vonetta McGee).
the Communist professor with
whom he falls in love, and then
to the brother and hack again.
There are no patterns, no mes
sages, no suggestions as to how
the brutal cycle of racism can be
stopped — only tepid predicta
ble action. Brothers is as accu
rate a rendition of George
Jackson's struggle for love and
freedom as The Front Page
would be as the filmed version of
All The President's Men.
It is a curiously unmoving
film, considering the charisma
and forcefulness of the peopleon

which it is based. Producers and
screenwriters Edward and
Mildred Lewis and director Ar
thur Barron rely on stereotypes
to tell the story of some extraor
dinarily unique individuals,
cheating both the memory of
those portrayed and the integrity
of the creators. Calling Brothers
a tribute to George lackson
would be like calling the
aforementioned All The Presi
dent's Men a tribute to Richard
Nixon.
In short, there is no depth to
Brothers. Everything is deftly
spelled out with no nuances or
shadings of good or evil.
Brothers' view of the world, if
you'll pardon the expression, is
black and white.

screenwriters Edward and
Mildred Lewis and director Ar
thur Barron rely on stereotypes
to tell the story of some extraor
dinarily unique individuals,
cheating both the memory of
those portrayed and the integrity
of the creators. Calling Brothers
a tribute to George lackson
would be like calling the
aforementioned All The Presi
dent's Men a tribute to Richard
Nixon.
In short, there is no depth to
Brothers. Everything is deftly
spelled out with no nuances or
shadings of good or evil.
Brothers' view of the world, if
you'll pardon the expression, is
black and white.

Brothers
A Warner Brothers release, produced by Ed
ward and Mildred Lewis, executive producer
Lee Savm. Directed by Arthur Barron. Written
by Lewis and Lewis Photographed by John
Morrill. Starring Bernie Casey, Vonetta McGee,
Ron O'Neal. MPAA rating: PG. Reviewed March

You'd think that the story of
the explosive life of George
Jackson and Angela Davis would
be a blockbuster on the silver sc
reen. A story torn from the head
lines! The brutal expose of
prison life! The indestructible

love that handcuffs and prison
bars couldn't contain! The in
spiring story of a fraternal love
that even death could not injure!
Yawn.
Much has been said against
the blaxploitation flicks lor pre
senting a biased view of the
world. But at least they provide a
catharsis. Brothers is much
worse. It offers nothing to either
the black audience or the white
audience. It exists in a limbo of
simplicity, slandering all its
characters with one
dimensional portraits. No won
der no real names were used.
The blacks are all oppressed

martyrs; the whites are a Simon
Legree gallery of sadistic evil. A
change of time and setting
would have made Brothers a
grade-B Civil War movie, some
thing like Boots without the
depth.
With its souffle-like texture of
emptiness, Brothers wafts like
an old newspaper covered with
old headlines from one focus to
another — first about David
Thomas (Bernie Casey) and his

brother, and then onto David and
Paula Jones (Vonetta McGee).
the Communist professor with
whom he falls in love, and then
to the brother and hack again.
There are no patterns, no mes
sages, no suggestions as to how
the brutal cycle of racism can be
stopped — only tepid predicta
ble action. Brothers is as accu
rate a rendition of George
Jackson's struggle for love and
freedom as The Front Page
would be as the filmed version of
All The President's Men.
It is a curiously unmoving
film, considering the charisma
and forcefulness of the peopleon

which it is based. Producers and
screenwriters Edward and
Mildred Lewis and director Ar
thur Barron rely on stereotypes
to tell the story of some extraor
dinarily unique individuals,
cheating both the memory of
those portrayed and the integrity
of the creators. Calling Brothers
