### 
The Magician An unjustly
neglected film by Bergman. The
mood is similar to that of The
Seventh Seal and Wild Straw
berries but the symbols loom
somewhat less ominously and
the actors seem to have more fun.
The screenplay lacks coherence
on a certain level and thus it is
easy to miss some of the more
subtle effects. Max Von Sydow is
masterful in the title role. Friday
evening at 7:30 in Cubberley.
Admission $1 (Stanford Film
Society).
North by Northwest The
Hitchcock film everyone has
seen at least once but which al
ways does well at the box office.
The master of the macabre
pushes every situation to the
limit of plausibility but never
quite loses his credibility.
Saturday evening at Hand 10:30
in kresge. Admission $1 (Law
School Film Society).
Bum The idea behind this
film makes more sense when
Marlon Brando's social and
political convictions are kept in
mind. The title is possibly the
most inflammatory aspect of the
story of a slave revolt on a Carib
bean island set at the time when

the sun was always high above
the British Empire. Brando plays
the imperialist who undergoes a
crisis of conscience. Loosely di
rected by Pontecorvo. Saturday
evening at 7 and 9:15 in Cubber
ley- Admission $1 (Radical Film
Series).
Le Notti di Cabiria Vintage
Fellini — made in 1957 before he
began shooting in lurid color
and while his grandiosity was
still under control. Episodes
from the life of an unpretentious
streetwalker (the character who
has been on the fringes of almost
every other Fellini film) create a
mood of unassuming optimism
strangely mixed with painless
despair. Tuesday evening at H in
kresge. Admission $1.25 (Italian
Film Series).
Le Plaisir Ophuls' deft,
light-fingered touch is very
much in evidence in this collec
tion of three ethereal vignettes.
The first two melt like cotton
candy, but the third has satisfy
ing substance. Very casual and
ironic throughout. Wednesday
evening at 7:30 and 9:30 in
Bishop. Admission $1.25
