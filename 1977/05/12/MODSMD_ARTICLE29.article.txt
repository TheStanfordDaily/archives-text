## A 						day of showering on the green 
### 
Having my alarm clock wake
me up at three in the morning,
after only two hours of sleep, is
not something to which 1 nor
mally look forward. In this case,
it was different — I was getting
ready for the first Day On The
Green spectacular of the year.
Although 1 was anticipating
great music from the lineup of
Steve Gibbons, Gary Wright, The
Doobie Brothers and Fleetwood
Mac, the Oakland Coliseum and
Stanford seemed worlds apart.
In the darkness of the early
morning, it was hard to imagine
joining an audience of 57,000 in
eight hours time.
Oakland at five in the morning
bustles with the endless traffic of
trailer trucks and vans streaming
down the freeway towards un
known destinations. Already a
line of bodies is forming at the
south gate of the Coliseum park
ing lot.
People are sitting against
guardrails, sleeping, and huddl

ing in small clusters on the
sidewalk warding off the crisp
coolness of the spring morning.
Bottles of beer lie strewn in the
gutter and pungent smoke filters
down the line. Conversation
doesn't hint of things to come —
comments on the stars, Venus,
and moon that hang in growing
light mingle with recaps of yes
terday's news. Sunrise is beauti
ful, with large puffed clouds
floating against a purplish-blue
sky.
Sprint
At 7:30 the parking lot gates
are opened and the line springs
to life. People spill through the
gates onto the asphalt as they
madly rush for the Coliseum
tunnels a quarter mile away,
only to find another line form
ing.
1 go through the main tunnel
to the stage at a quarter to nine.
Standing in theempty bleachers,
1 am one of the first people (other
than concert employes) to see

the concrete crater with its lush
green carpeting. Minutes later
the four main access tunnels are
open and a surge of people race
for the best seats — right in front
of the elaborately decorated
stage.
Large banners with names of
towns, schools, or concert per
formers rise above the flood of
people, giving the field the ap
pearance of a fanciful political
convention. Like an army of ants
swarming to a meal, concert
goers file in and nearly fill the
stadium as the concert begins.
The most pleasant surprise of
the day is the fine showmanship
displayed by Gary Wright.

Wright, alias "the Dream
weaver," provides a set with
strong, driving rhythm which
has a large majority of the spec
tators on the field standing and
clapping to his music.
Strong keyboard arrange
ments, including Wright's port
able keyboard unit, provide the
rich sound and effects charac
terized by "Love Is Alive" (com
plete with haunting reverbs),
and"The Dreamweaver." Well
before the second encore
number, "I'm Alright," is per
formed, Wright has de
monstrated his poise as a musi
cian.
Clouds
As the Doobie Brothers pre
pare to take the stage, large
clouds gather over the area,
blocking the bright sunlight
which looked so promising ear
lier. The Doobies aren't under
the weather, however, as they
get the crowd moving right from
the start with "China Grove."
Their set sounds, for the most
part, like their greatest hits al
bum, with favorites like "Takin'
It To The Streets," "It Keeps You
Running," "Jesus Is Just Al
right," and the prophetic "Black
Water."
Interspersed among the rec
ognizable hits are new and lesser
known numbers, but even these
prove that there is no energy
shortage as far as the Doobies are
concerned. While the fans are
very patient with the showers,
the musicians are also putting
up with the weather. In particu
lar, one of the drummers, as
sisted during "Black Water" by
Bill Graham on tambourine,
hangs in there despite a large

leak in the stage's overhead tar
paulin. To remedy the situation,
towels and umbrellas are re
quired to dry the percussionist
off.
Wait
The hour and a half wait bet
ween the Doobies and Fleet
wood Mac, mostly due to the
water on the stage and equip
ment, makes the audience visi
bly and audibly impatient.
When the rain temporarily
ceases, the fans occupy them
selves with frisbee demonstra
tions and blanket tossing. Par
ticularly fine efforts draw
rounds of applause from onlook
ers.
When all systems finally are
go for the final act, Fleetwood
Mac makes a grand entrance via
a giant replica of a cooking pot
that is lifted to the stage level.
After girls throwing flowers out
to the crowd leave, Fleetwood
Mac gets down to business.
Although not quite as impres
sive as their recordings, the
quintet blends instruments and
vocals together in the accus
tomed Fleetwood Mac style.
While most of the numbers are
well received, the cuts which re
ceive national airplay such as
"Rhiannon," "Over My Head,"
"Go Your Own Way," and their
latest hit "Dreams," cause roars
of cheering.
Stevie Nicks prowls the stage,
resembling a relative of the
forest wildlife which is air
brushed on the stage. Rather
than a gracefully flowing god
dess as she was described in the

program, Nicks seems stiff dur
ing her vocals. The cold weather,
for which the band is not par
ticularly dressed, is mentioned
by the members, and possibly
can explain the subdued stage
activity. Despite the enthusiastic
audience reaction, Fleetwood
Mac seems bent on leaving the
stage telling us "You can go on
home, now" more seriously than

sarcastically.
The performances of Wright,
the Doobies, and Fleetwood Mac
proved to be worth the soaking.
Although promoter Graham
paced nervously backstage and
looked disgustedly at the sky, he
can be assured that Day On The
Green number one satisfied the
audience and lived up to its en
thusiastic billing.


57,000 — count'em.
A sellout crowd enjoys Day On The Green number one.
