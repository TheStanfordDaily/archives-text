Film showings in dormitories. a
one-night spree at Marriott's Great
America and charter flights to Dallas
are among the ASSI '-sponsored ac
tivities students can look forward to
ne\t year if the tentative plans of the
newly appointed ASSI I project mana
gers go smoothly.
Brian Meeker. Sunday Flicks man
ager. said that while he is currently in
training for I'licks manager, he is also
beginning to book films for the sum
mer and autumn quarter Flicks.
"During the summer we try to book
movies which are good quality but not
as expensive, such as old classics."
Becker explained. "Then in thefall we
try to show more contemporary films."
The Men Who Would He king and
The Omen are the two movies which
will most probably be shown autumn
quarter, he said.
New ideas
Becker said he has two new ideas
planned tor next year. One is to offer a
service where the ASSI! would pro
vide the film, equipment and projec
tionist for dorms and to show movies.
"This was tried a couple years ago
but was not carried through. I still
think it's a good idea." Becker com
mented.
Another idea is to show short films
made by students here in addition to
the regularly scheduled shorts.
Becker said he thought "this would
be more of a service project" in terms
ol giving recognition to student
filmmakers as well as providing more
entertainment.
Providing entertainment is also the
job of Special Events manager Mark
Curtis.
"1 take that in a very broad spectrum.
I don't think that rock or jazz music
fulfills the demand for oncampus en
tertainment." Curtis commented.
Curtis said he plans to bill more fre
quent shows on a smaller scale and
still have at least one major show each
quarter.
Performers
Possible performers Curtis men
tioned include Ceorge Carlin and the

San Francisco Mime Troop. Another
idea is to rent Marriott's (treat America
amusement park for one night exclu
sively for Stanford students.
"My goal is to have an autumn quar
ter events schedule in the reg pack in
September, excluding major shows
which would have to be announced as
they came along." Curtis said.
T-shirt Service manager Denise
lrusta and Lecture Notes manager Bill
knickel began their jobs May 1. lrusta
said she is in charge of buying shirts
from manufacturers and then silk sc
reening designs on them for various
campus groups.
This year the service also sold "Rob
ber Baron" and "Work. Study. C.et
Rich" T-shirts. Next year the service
may make another mascot T-shirt, said
lrusta. but no specific plans have been
made yet.
Knickel said his job entails selecting
which classes to cover, soliciting the
participation of the instructors, hiring
notetakers and getting the notes out to

the students who subscribe to the ser
vice.
Classes covered
According to knickel. 17 to 20 clas
ses are covered each quarter. "Since
our service can only handle a certain
number of classes, we try to cover the
largest lecture classes so we can be
nefit the greatest number ot students."
he explained.
Travel Service manager Breck
Walker said his main job is to provide
charters for students here. Walker said
he is planning to conduct a survey in
September to see where students
would like to fly during winter break.
In the past, charters have gone to New
York. Chicago, Boston and
Washington D.C.. but Walker said
there may also be a flight to Dallas it
students show enough interest.
The new project managers went
through an application and interview
selection process which began in
March. Final selections were made b\
incoming ASSII financial Manager
Miles White.

they came along." Curtis said.
T-shirt Service manager Denise
lrusta and Lecture Notes manager Bill
knickel began their jobs May 1. lrusta
said she is in charge of buying shirts
from manufacturers and then silk sc
reening designs on them for various
campus groups.
This year the service also sold "Rob
ber Baron" and "Work. Study. C.et
Rich" T-shirts. Next year the service
may make another mascot T-shirt, said
lrusta. but no specific plans have been
made yet.

which classes to cover, soliciting the
participation of the instructors, hiring
notetakers and getting the notes out to

the students who subscribe to the ser
vice.
Classes covered
According to knickel. 17 to 20 clas
ses are covered each quarter. "Since
our service can only handle a certain
number of classes, we try to cover the
largest lecture classes so we can be
nefit the greatest number ot students."
he explained.
Travel Service manager Breck
Walker said his main job is to provide
charters for students here. Walker said
he is planning to conduct a survey in
September to see where students
would like to fly during winter break.
In the past, charters have gone to New
York. Chicago, Boston and
Washington D.C.. but Walker said
there may also be a flight to Dallas it
students show enough interest.
The new project managers went
through an application and interview
selection process which began in
March. Final selections were made b\
incoming ASSII financial Manager
Miles White.
Film showings in dormitories. a
one-night spree at Marriott's Great
America and charter flights to Dallas
are among the ASSI '-sponsored ac
tivities students can look forward to
ne\t year if the tentative plans of the
newly appointed ASSI I project mana
gers go smoothly.
Brian Meeker. Sunday Flicks man
ager. said that while he is currently in
training for I'licks manager, he is also
beginning to book films for the sum
mer and autumn quarter Flicks.
"During the summer we try to book
movies which are good quality but not
as expensive, such as old classics."
Becker explained. "Then in thefall we
try to show more contemporary films."
The Men Who Would He king and
The Omen are the two movies which
will most probably be shown autumn
quarter, he said.
New ideas
Becker said he has two new ideas
planned tor next year. One is to offer a
service where the ASSI! would pro
vide the film, equipment and projec
tionist for dorms and to show movies.
"This was tried a couple years ago
but was not carried through. I still
think it's a good idea." Becker com
mented.
Another idea is to show short films
made by students here in addition to
the regularly scheduled shorts.
Becker said he thought "this would
be more of a service project" in terms
ol giving recognition to student
filmmakers as well as providing more
entertainment.
Providing entertainment is also the
job of Special Events manager Mark
Curtis.
"1 take that in a very broad spectrum.
I don't think that rock or jazz music
fulfills the demand for oncampus en
tertainment." Curtis commented.
Curtis said he plans to bill more fre
quent shows on a smaller scale and
still have at least one major show each
quarter.
Performers
Possible performers Curtis men
tioned include Ceorge Carlin and the

San Francisco Mime Troop. Another
idea is to rent Marriott's (treat America
amusement park for one night exclu
sively for Stanford students.
