# Shearing at Music Hall
## 
### 
Pianist George Shearing, noted for his widely appealing cool
jazz, will perform with his quintet at the Great American Music
Hall Friday and Saturday night.
Shearing was born in Londonand moved totheU.S. in 1948.
He developed a kind of "popular jazz" by trimming arrange
ments to the basic theme and variations. The quintet uses all
rhythm instruments: piano, vibes, guitar, bass and drums. The
music consists chiefly of standards, and improvisation never
strays far from the melody.
Shearing has never been an innovator. His style is slick and
somewhat facile. Two pianists, primarily, have influenced
him: Lennie Tristano and Bud Powell.
Though several jazz commentators have criticized Shearing
for "sacrificing continuing self-searching for a mechanical
formula which ensures him continued high box-office gros
ses . . ." they can't deny the popularity he's brought to jazz,
which benefits other musicians as well.
