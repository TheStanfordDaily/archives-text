South Africa approves Young visit
Washington — The South African govern
ment. after showing considerable reluctance,
yesterday approved an official U.S. request for
Ambassador Andrew Young to visit next week.
The decision, announced by the State Depart
ment, broadens the dimensions of Young's cur
rent tour of Africa. Two other countries, Liberia
and Sudan, also were added to his itinerary yes
terday whilea fourth, Nigeria, was deleted until a
follow-up trip later in the year.
Tensions between Young and South Africa
were raised when the outspoken ambassador
questioned the legitimacy of the South African
government and, on another occasion, said he
hates to have anything to do with it.
Then, when reports surfaced that Young
would meet with militant blacks, Foreign Minis
ter R.F. Botha said that "if this in fact is the case, it
would not be convenient for us to receive him
here."
The State Department, however, persisted
through diplomatic channels in seeking accep
tance of Young.
Once in South Africa, the black, former civil
rights worker, is expected to manifest the Carter
administration's distaste for apartheid.
However, the administration also is counting
on South Africa to help persuade the white
minority government in Rhodesia to yield con
trol to the 6.1 million blacks in the breakaway
British colony.
Federal court lifts Concorde ban
New York — In a ruling that brought joy in

Paris and outrage in Queens, a federal judge de
clared yesterday that New York's airports had no
right to bar the supersonic: Concorde jetliner. Air
France immediately announced it would begin
flights from Paris to New York next month.
Judge Milton Pollack ruled that the Port Au
thority of New York and New Jersey which oper
ates metropolitan airports could not overrule
federal policy mandating Concorde test runs. But
he stopped short of formally granting the faster
than-sound aircraft access to Kennedy.
New York Cov. ffugh Carey and Donald
Manes, borough president of Queens, site of
Kennedy Airport, both called on the Port Author
ity to appeal Pollack's decision. And New York's
Mayor Abraham Beame said he would continue
to oppose SST service here "unless the approp
riate environmental criteria, such as noiseand air
pollution standards, are met."
In Paris, nevertheless, Air France said it is pro
ceeding on the basis that its suit was won and
scheduled its first Concorde flight to New York
for June 20. An appellate court, however, could
upset this timetable.

South Africa approves Young visit
Washington — The South African govern
ment. after showing considerable reluctance,
yesterday approved an official U.S. request for
Ambassador Andrew Young to visit next week.
The decision, announced by the State Depart
ment, broadens the dimensions of Young's cur
rent tour of Africa. Two other countries, Liberia
and Sudan, also were added to his itinerary yes
terday whilea fourth, Nigeria, was deleted until a
follow-up trip later in the year.
Tensions between Young and South Africa
were raised when the outspoken ambassador
questioned the legitimacy of the South African
government and, on another occasion, said he
hates to have anything to do with it.
Then, when reports surfaced that Young
would meet with militant blacks, Foreign Minis
ter R.F. Botha said that "if this in fact is the case, it
would not be convenient for us to receive him
here."
The State Department, however, persisted
through diplomatic channels in seeking accep
tance of Young.
Once in South Africa, the black, former civil
rights worker, is expected to manifest the Carter
administration's distaste for apartheid.
However, the administration also is counting
on South Africa to help persuade the white
minority government in Rhodesia to yield con
trol to the 6.1 million blacks in the breakaway
British colony.
Federal court lifts Concorde ban
New York — In a ruling that brought joy in

Paris and outrage in Queens, a federal judge de
clared yesterday that New York's airports had no
right to bar the supersonic: Concorde jetliner. Air
France immediately announced it would begin
flights from Paris to New York next month.
Judge Milton Pollack ruled that the Port Au
thority of New York and New Jersey which oper
ates metropolitan airports could not overrule
federal policy mandating Concorde test runs. But
he stopped short of formally granting the faster
than-sound aircraft access to Kennedy.
New York Cov. ffugh Carey and Donald
Manes, borough president of Queens, site of
Kennedy Airport, both called on the Port Author
ity to appeal Pollack's decision. And New York's
Mayor Abraham Beame said he would continue
to oppose SST service here "unless the approp
riate environmental criteria, such as noiseand air
pollution standards, are met."
In Paris, nevertheless, Air France said it is pro
ceeding on the basis that its suit was won and
scheduled its first Concorde flight to New York
for June 20. An appellate court, however, could
upset this timetable.
