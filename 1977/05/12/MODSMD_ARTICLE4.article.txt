# Congressional lid on costs suggested
## Carter criticizes hospital inefficiency 
### 
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter's ad
ministration. urging new laws to put a lid on hospi
tal costs, blamed inefficiency for much of the in
crease in hospital bills.
The attack on the industry came yesterday as con
gressional hearings began on the administration's
proposal to limit hospital cost increases.
One witness. Secretary of Health. Education and
Welfare Joseph Califano, disputed industry claims
that the cost ceiling would hurt patient care.
"This objection is totally incorrect," Califano said.
"Many cost reductions can, if managed approp
riately, actually increase the quality of care and put
the obese hospital industry in better shape to serve
our patients and health care system."
The assertion, made at a joi nt hearing of two House
subcommittees, will be challenged later in the hear
ings by hospital spokesmen, who have already an
nounced opposition to the administration plan.

Cartar proposed limiting rises in hospital costs to a
rate equal to the general inflation rate plus an allo
wance for improved health care.
The proposal would meananannual limit of about
nine per cent at the current inflation rate. This com
pares to annual increases in recent years of about IF)
per cent in hospital hills.
Califano said hospitals could achieve substantial
savings "by reducing unnecessary utilization, waste
and duplication of facilities."
He gave a "fat list to hospital expenditures" that
can be reduced:
—Of the 240.000 empty beds in community hospi
tals, he said, "at least 100,000 of these beds are abso
lutely unnecessary."
—Of the 700,000 patients in acute-care hospitals,
he said, "as many as 100,000 do not need to be there
and could be better cared lor at home, in skilled
nursing facilities or on an outpatient basis."

—Use of costly and often unnecessary tests and
therapies have increased rapidly in recent years, he
said. "Physicians have increasingly made it a prac
tice to order extensive tests for every patient admit
ted even when there is very little to be gained from
such tests."
Califano said hospital costs will double within
five years if allowed to go unchecked.
"The largest single bill paid by General Motors is
not for steel but for health insurance." he said. "The
cost of health insurance added $110 to the cost of
each Ford automobile sold during 1075."
Califano asserted that higher hospital costs are
devouring revenue needed for child health and other
pressing health needs.
Persons without major medical insurance cover
age now risk "financial ruin and a lifetime of inde
btedness," he said.
