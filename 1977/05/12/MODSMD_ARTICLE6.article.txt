# Committee designing British studies major
## 
### Emily Sachar 
British studies will debut next year
as an interdepartmental,
individually-designed major. A com
mittee with professors from five diffe
rent departments has formed to assist
students with construction of the
major.
"Most of ns on the committee feel
th.it there is an artificial division
among related subject areas that is due
to the departmental character of this
University." said Assoc. English I'rot.
Hon Rebholz.a member of the commit
tee.
"One could make more out of the
English Civil War ol the 17th Century
with a knowledge of Milton's poetry
and vice versa. Most people presently
miss this crucial connection." Cur
rently, students interested in pursuing
study in British areas must seek their

own advisers and choose their own
courses, according to Kebholz.
"Because of this, many students
probably did not even think of British
studies as a possible major." Kebholz
said.
With the establishment of the com
mittee. students will have easier ac
cess to faculty interested in helping
design majors in the field, according to
Ann I'ogle, administrative assistant at
the Overseas Studies Office.
A list of appropriate courses for the
self-designed major will be available
next year in the Academic Information
Center, she added.
All students with individually
designed majors in British studies will
be urged to spend two to three quarters
studying in Britain, either on their
own or at the Cliveden campus. The
program, however, is not sponsored by
Overseas Studies.
"Organizing this program seemed
appropriate to us since we have access
to an overseas campus where courses
are taught from a variety of depart
ments â€” stressing social, economic
political and artistic aspects of British
culture," Kebholz said.
"We hope the program will grow by
referrals and natural accumulation of
interest," I'ogle said.
Provided there is sufficient student
interest and assuming that the Clive
den campus can be renewed sub
sequent to 197H, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) will
examine British Studies as a potential
major.
Work to set up the committee began
early in the 1975-7H academic year.
The committee for the program in
British Studies includes English Prof.
Ceorge Dekker. Kebholz, Art Profes
sors I.orenz Eitner and Michael Sulli
van. History Prof. Peter Stanskv (Con
vener), Assoc. History Prot. Paul Ser
ver. Asst. Economics Prof. Alexander
Field, and I,aw Prof. Mark Franklin.
