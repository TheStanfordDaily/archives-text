Theatmosphere pervadingthe
Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) rally Monday night was
one of confidence that students
can and will fight apartheid in
South Africa. It is important to
know whether this confidence
reflects inevitable beneficial re
percussions of the rally or only
delusions of accomplishment
built upon hour after hour of
reinforcing one another's opin
ions as the rally drew wider and
wider attention.
SCRIP claims to fight apar
theid but formally the principal
struggle is to get Stanford to
make an essentially symbolic
gesture by voting its Ford stock
in favor of a resolution to with
draw completely from South Af
rica.
One can expect little effect on
Ford, but even if Ford were
forced to withdraw, the change
would leave the company un
able to fight apartheid, regard
less of whether or not it does
now.
Even so, if Ford led the way for
other American and foreign cor
porations to withdraw from
South Africa, the resulting
economic pressure would force
the abandonment of apartheid.
It isn't clear to begin with that
pulling out American personnel

but leaving behind American
capital inflicts crippling
economic pressure, but even if it
does one must ask who will feel
the pressure most, whites or
blacks.
If the trustees vote yes on the
Ford resolution, they will say
that Stanford represents the
carefully thought out opinion
that withdrawal of American in
terests from South Africa helps
to improve the lot of South Afri
can blacks.
Thus SCRIP demands that the
University place its reputation
behind a shaky viewpoint that
has little to do with declaring
apartheid an important problem,
but more to do with how to solve
the problem.
Since the rally made interna
tional news one can argue that
its primary accomplishment was
to remind the world of the South

African problem, which is a
noble objective regardless of
whatever the original objective
was.
Of course newswatchers are
not unaware of the problem
anyway, but perhaps the rally
will help to stir them into action.
But random action is not neces
sarily helpful, and since South
Africa presents a complicated
problem, it would be easy to mis
takenly take damaging action.
Demonstrations thrive better
on emotion than reason. It is dif
ficult to confidently contend
that the logic of the SCRIP rally
is sound. Rather, it appears that
under the guise of fighting apar
theid, SCRIP is pushing a de
mand that has little effect on the
problem and may even be unde
sirable.

One can expect little effect on
Ford, but even if Ford were
forced to withdraw, the change
would leave the company un
able to fight apartheid, regard
less of whether or not it does
now.
Even so, if Ford led the way for
other American and foreign cor
porations to withdraw from
South Africa, the resulting
economic pressure would force
the abandonment of apartheid.
It isn't clear to begin with that
pulling out American personnel

but leaving behind American
capital inflicts crippling
economic pressure, but even if it
does one must ask who will feel
the pressure most, whites or
blacks.
If the trustees vote yes on the
Ford resolution, they will say
that Stanford represents the
carefully thought out opinion
that withdrawal of American in
terests from South Africa helps
to improve the lot of South Afri
can blacks.
Thus SCRIP demands that the
University place its reputation
behind a shaky viewpoint that
has little to do with declaring
apartheid an important problem,
but more to do with how to solve
the problem.
Since the rally made interna
tional news one can argue that
its primary accomplishment was
to remind the world of the South

African problem, which is a
noble objective regardless of
whatever the original objective
was.
Of course newswatchers are
not unaware of the problem
anyway, but perhaps the rally
will help to stir them into action.
But random action is not neces
sarily helpful, and since South
Africa presents a complicated
problem, it would be easy to mis
takenly take damaging action.
Demonstrations thrive better
on emotion than reason. It is dif
ficult to confidently contend
that the logic of the SCRIP rally
is sound. Rather, it appears that
under the guise of fighting apar
theid, SCRIP is pushing a de
mand that has little effect on the
problem and may even be unde
sirable.
