" 11 will demand the best of us,
our vision, our dedication, our
courage and our sense of com
mon purpose."
—President Jimmy Carter,
April IH. 1977
For the past two weeks Presi
dent Carter, his aides, congres
sional leaders, economists, pro
fessors, guest speakers, the news
media ad inf initum have been so
aptly reminding us that the
energy crisis is here. The entire
nation has been rallied to the
new great challenge of the 1970s
(dare 1 say of our lifetime?) —
conservation of energy.
All at once, Americans have
accepted the president's most
foreboding demand that we
must conserve, sacrifice, work
for efficiency and, in a phrase,
"use less and pay more."
After years of public apathy,
why the sudden about-face in
American energy concerns?
Perhaps a brief history lesson
will help answer this question.
For decades the nation heard but
failed to comprehend the impas
sioned pleas and warnings from
environmentalists.
Then came the equally
impassioned and yet equally
ignored admonitions and pro
tests from conservationists and
planetary realists. Americans
failed to reckon with the har
binger's call until slapped on the
face by the less than subtle ac
tions of a couple of shahs. Fi
nally, the threat of another OPEC
oil embargo etched the problem
of energy conservation into
permanent public awareness.
1973 crisis
The immediate result of the
1973 crisis was not to conserve,
but rather to seek out the cause of
this so inconvenient occurence.
Americans dreamed up three po
tential villains. First, the
"greedy Arabs" were trying to
deprive America of its natural
right to oil.
Then the giant oil conglomer
ates were plotting to raise the
price of gasoline (which may
very well be true). And more re
cently the blame has shifted to

Big Government and the
Washington bureaucrats who
work at the mercy of special in
terest groups and constantly in
terfere with the flawless free
market.
No doubt, each of these three
groups have had some effect
upon the current energy pinch
(most notably, the quadrupling
of foreign oil prices by OPEC in
1973). However, in each case the
real villain has escaped recogni
tion, and so we are faced today
with the harsh realization that
energy is scarce because we
Americans wasted it and con
tinue to waste it, because we
Americans ignored the pleas for
conservation and because we
Americans have yet to com
prehend that this is a world of
limited resources.
The need to conserve those
limited resources cannot be de
nied. The United States con
sumes the equivalent of 38 mill
ion barrels of oil per day. We
must import seven million bar
rels a day from somewhat less
than secure sources and our de
pendence on foreign oil is grow
ing, not lessening.
In addition, the U.S. consumes
more energy per unit of produc
tion than any of the most de
veloped nations.
Oil consumption
The world consumed more oil
in the 1950's than it had in all
prior history. The 1960s showed
a repeat of that undesirable ac
complishment and today the
world is consuming oil at an ever
increasing pace.
Moreover, the CIA has esti
mated that by 1985 the current
demand for oil, if not checked,
will create global shortages
pushing the price of crude oil to
$36 a barrel and increasing the
domestic price of gasoline to $2 a
gallon.
Perhaps even more startling is
the fact that if current consump
tion grows at two per cent a year
(one half the current growth rate
in the U.S.) all known reserves of
oil will be gone in 50 years.
Accepting the fact that we do
live in a world of diminishing

and limited resources, the ques
tion is how to limit demand and
achieve optimal conservation of
energy use. Three potential
answers are commonly offered:
(1) free market price equilibrium,
(2) egalitarian methods of ration
ing, and (3) increased govern
ment excise taxes and subsidies.
The first answer is the stan
dard laissez-faire economic sol
ution. It is propounded by Stan
ford's new researcher, Nobel
prize winner and conservative
Milton Friedman.
The economist reiterates the
old warning — TANSTAAFI,
(There ain't no such thing as a
free lunch). If we want more
energy, we'll have to pay the
price.
Friedman further suggests
that we just let the free market
take care of conservation. Let
prices rise unhampered by gov
ernment regulation and sub
sidies, and the so heralded laws
of supply and demand will
squeeze out energy inefficiency.
Unfortunately, as good as
economist as Friedman is, he
forgets that such a "cold-turkey"
(Paul Samuelson's phrase) move
back to the free market would be
political and economic suicide.
The American people, organized
labor and even business would
not stand for it. The poor would
be the first and the hardest hit.
Jobless rate
Unemployment would
skyrocket inall industries which
require oil for production (try to
think of any that do not), and the
entire economy would spiral
into chaos. The argument is that
a rising tide raises all ships.
However, a rising tide where
only the oil producers are af
forded ships and 215 million
Americans drown is by no
means fair or desirable.
Clearly, a government that has
regulated the economy for so
long has a responsibility to alter
regulation slowly and gradually.
The proposal for rationing has
not been widely accepted as it
raises serious questions of effi
ciency and fairness. Even if ra
tioning could be established
without problems of enforce
ment, bureaucratic waste, and
black markets, the question still
arises over who's to get how
much and on what basis.
Granted, rationing could limit
consumption to available
supplies by depriving all con
sumers and industries equally,
but it would most likely main
tain the present artifically low
prices and merely forestall the
necessary adjustments to the
energy situation.
Increasing the use of govern
ment excise taxes and subsidies
provides a partial answer to the
problem of conservation and ef
ficiency. Tax subsidies and re
bates can be used to encourage
efficient use of energy, while
prohibitory taxes can be used to
discourage energy abuse and
waste. This answer sounds sim
ple but in fact becomes quite
complex. An intricate web of
measures and counter-measures
must be enacted. Indeed, each
tax can have manifold repercus
sions.
Gas tax up
For example, the proposed
five cent standby gasoline tax
could end up becoming a disin
centive to the poor alone, requir

ing another system of tax re
funds and subsidy assistance.
The free market, rationing, tax
incentives orany single program
in itself cannot offer a viable
answer to the energy problem.
An effective national energy pol
icy calls for a complex, interwo
ven combination of many
policies tying together the effi
ciency of the free market, the
egalitarianism of a rationing sys
tem and the workability of taxes.
This brings us to the Carter
proposal presently debated in
Congress.
Carter's plan is a policy of "use
less, pay more" to be achieved
through a combination of patrio
tic appeal and economic incen
tives. The most impressive ac
complishment of Presidnet Car
ter's energy policy thus far is that
in less than 100 days he was able
to gain the symbolic support for
a plan that promises to bring
much sacrifice and deep cutting
changes in our lifestyle.
Calling forth the reservoirs of
American energy stored within
our sense of patriotism the pres
ident warned America, "This is
the greatest challenge our nation
will face in our lifetime." Bor
rowing a phrase from William
James, Carter declared that our
energy battle would he"the
moral equivalent of war." know
ing full well that the frontier
spirit of the American people
would respond wholeheartedly
to a test of will and strength, the
president offered us an emotional
challenge, and as Sen. Charles
Percy (R-Ill.) said. "It's the
greatest challenge any peace
time president ever gave the na
tion."
Symbolic challenges are fine,
but Carter realizes that when it
comes to actual action, you can't
beat dollars-and-cents motiva
tion. Through tax rebates, the
president's plan will encourage
small car sales and insulation of
both businesses and homes as
well as installation of home
solar-heating equipment. Re
strictive taxes will be used to
discourage the production and
sale of the famed gas guzzler.
Standby tax
A standby tax on gasoline of
five cents per gallon will be
utilized if gas consumption ex
ceeds the federal targets. Oil
price restrictions will be gradu
ally decreased allowing the
price of "old oil" ($5.17 a barrel)
to reach the world price of about

$15 by 1980 and the price of
newly discovered oil ($11.28 a
barrel) to reach the 1977 world
price level over a three-year
period.
Interstate and intrastate
natural gas price discrepancies
will be eliminated as the price of
each will be leveled at $1.75 per
1000 cubic feet. Utilities will be
forced to phase out "promo
tional rates" which provide dis
counts for large energy users and
encourage waste.
In addition, Carter will use
liighly prohibitive taxes to en
courage industry and utility
plants to convert from oil and
natural gas to coal.
The plan promises slow and
incremental steps toward
gasoline price deregulation and
a gradual return to freemarket
price levels for most energy
sources. Furthermore, there are
provisions to insure that the
poor receive tax subsidies and
assistance to help them adjust to
the higher energy prices.
Not perfect
The Carter plan is far from
flawless. There is little emphasis
on increasing energy supplies or
encouraging production and de
velopment of new energy
sources. The issue of protecting
the environment has been ig
nored as evidenced by the provi
sion which would increase pro
duction of highly-polluting coal
by 400 million tons per year. The
president also wishes to increase
economic growth to six per cent
while decreasing the annual
energy consumption growth rate
to two per cent. These two goals
may prove to be directly in con
flict.
The president's plan is, how
ever, a step in the right direction.
For the first time in our history
the nation has a comprehensive
national energy policy. Carter
has attacked the problem of con
servation with a two-edged
sword — with both substance
and style.
His styleof making a symbolic
appeal to our patriotism has
been successful. The substance
of his energy plan seems valid.
Whether or not the substance
behind the president's style will
lead to efficiency and conserva
tion will depend in a large part
upon our own ability to accept
economic sacrifices and to exer
cise common sense.
