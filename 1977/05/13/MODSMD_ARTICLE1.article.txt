# Draw fouled up; results delayed

Round one housing draw results
were withdrawn yesterday because
students who acquired priorities did
not receive the benefit of these
priorities during the first round as
signment, according to Philip Curry,
administrative assistant to the dean of
student affairs in the Office of Residen
tial Education.
Results were released late yesterday
morning to all residences on campus,
but were withdrawn at about 3:30
p.m., Curry said.
"There was absolutely no problem
with the draw itself or the original as
signing process â€” the process is
purely technical, perhaps due to a lack
of sufficient data for the computer

program," said Curry.
"We withdrew the results as quickly
as possible," he said. "One student re
ported that his computer print-out
looked funny. Behind the three-digit
code number of a house requiring a
special priority, there was a dash or
hyphen where the student's priority
should have been."
Priorities on cards
Students' priorities are still listed on
the original draw cards, which are on
file, Curry said.
According to Curry, access to spe
cial priority houses during round one
this year was restricted to students
who actually had their original draw
cards stamped.
"During round two," said Curry,
"we will relax the standards some
what, allowing students to be assigned
to special priority houses where they
did not acquire a priority."
"However,"added Curry, "thereare
still students who sign up for special
priority houses during round one
without having any priority for those
houses."
Curry said that this was where the
problem with priorities occurred.
No distinction
"It was indicated to me that on the
print-outs there was no difference be
tween the people who do. have
priorities and the people without
priorities who write down these spe
cial priority houses anyway," said
Curry.
The Housing Office has not yet been
able to systematically isolate the group
of people that this has happened to, he
