Sororities
Should the University repeal
the 35-year-old ban on sororities?
While the Stanford Board of
Trustees is examining this issue,
students are also questioning the
need for sororities on this cam
pus. Many claim that since men
have the option of selective
housing, women, too, should
have the same right.
Others feel that there is no
longer a need for sororities, and
that their reinstitution would
cause more problems than
they'd be worth. Perhaps there
no longer is a practical need for
sororities, for our society no
longer governs the way in which
men and women should interact.
Sororities have, however,
many more desirable aspects
than most people realize. Be
cause of the many misconcep
tions about sororities, though,
sororities have a stigma about
them that people from
seeing them in a positive light.
Because any evaluation of the
advantages of a sorority (or
fraternity) is subject to personal
preference, it is difficult to out
line distinct advantages a soror
ity (or fraternity) has over other
types of housing.
The first that might come to
mind is the option men have
here to rush a fraternity if they
get a bad number in the draw.
Although they are not assured of
getting into the fraternity of their
choice, they at least have the op

tion of trying; sororities would
offer women the same option.
Fraternities also afford men
the opportunity to stay on cam
pus during their unguaranteed
year, an opportunity which
women do not have available.
Many women, though they
might like the idea of having
sororities on campus and feel
that women should have the
same housing opportunities as
men, are afraid to even consider
the issue because of the various
misconceptions about sororities.
These misconceptions range
from ideas like, "sororities
monopolize fraternity func
tions," to "sororities create in
tense competition among wo
men," and many more.
Of course ideas like this can be
true, but just as all fat people
aren't jolly, all sororities don't
follow one single pattern. First
of all, with so many housing op
tions available to students today,
it is difficult to conceive of
sororities being so popular that
they would be the dominant
housing preference for women
on this campus.
Just as fraternities are prefer
red by some men, and not by
others, many women would
probably be happier staying in
co-ed housing, thus competition
would be no greater than it is for
fraternities.
During the 1940s and 1950s
when fraternities and sororities
were at the peak of their popular
ity at co-ed colleges and univer
sities, men and women needed

an institution through which
they could meet and"court."
Today, male-female encoun
ters and relationships are not
governed by a strict social
framework, but are more open
and relaxed. Hence, the function
of sororities would not be to pro
vide a means by which women
could meet "frat men," but to
allow women to experience the
same growth and responsibility
men experience through frater
nities.
Perhaps, indeed, sororities
have no place at Stanford today,
but then, neither do fraternities.
Few, however, are as vehe
mently opposed to the existence
of fraternities as they are to the
existence of sororities. Certainly
sororities and fraternities are not
for everyone, but if men have the
opportunity to choose between a
fraternity and other types of
housing at Stanford, women
should enjoy the same right.

KZSU concert
KZSU's Tuesday, May 3 noon
concert on Tresidder back patio
was the best example of noise
pollution 1 have ever heard. One
certainly could not call what
transpired there music. It was
much too loud and wrong to be
called that.
It was impossible for me to
walk from the Tresidder lobby to
the Store without covering my
ears. Even with that there was

some discomfort from the loud
noise. My ears suffered from its
effects late into the evening.
What surprised me more than
anything was that people were
actually listening to what was
being performed without any
signs of disagreement. They
even applauded between num
bers.
At 24,1 do not consider myself
an old person. But if listening to
that garbage at eardrum bursting
levels is what it takes to be
young, I qualify for the geriatric
ward. I would prefer to be old
rather than have my right to go
safely from one building to
another infringed upon by that
loud mess.
1 am a great fan of rock music
and have attended many noon
concerts, but it cannot possibly
be healthy to listen to what I
heard the other day on the back
patio. I am concerned that my
generation may well be on its
way to becoming a generation of
deaf people, if we are not that
already.
1 know that noontime enter
tainment is a big thing here but
K/.SU should find a better way to
use its money. They should
sponsor parties in the evening
and hire better groups to play
longer instead of getting some
two bit flops to come over and
turn their amplifiers all the way
up to hide their lack of talent for
an hour.

Sororities
Should the University repeal
the 35-year-old ban on sororities?
While the Stanford Board of
Trustees is examining this issue,
students are also questioning the
need for sororities on this cam
pus. Many claim that since men
have the option of selective
housing, women, too, should
have the same right.
Others feel that there is no
longer a need for sororities, and
that their reinstitution would
cause more problems than
they'd be worth. Perhaps there
no longer is a practical need for
sororities, for our society no
longer governs the way in which
men and women should interact.
Sororities have, however,
many more desirable aspects
than most people realize. Be
cause of the many misconcep
tions about sororities, though,
sororities have a stigma about
them that people from
seeing them in a positive light.
Because any evaluation of the
advantages of a sorority (or
fraternity) is subject to personal
preference, it is difficult to out
line distinct advantages a soror
ity (or fraternity) has over other
types of housing.
The first that might come to
mind is the option men have
here to rush a fraternity if they
get a bad number in the draw.
Although they are not assured of
getting into the fraternity of their
choice, they at least have the op

tion of trying; sororities would
offer women the same option.
Fraternities also afford men
the opportunity to stay on cam
pus during their unguaranteed
year, an opportunity which
women do not have available.
Many women, though they
might like the idea of having
sororities on campus and feel
that women should have the
same housing opportunities as
men, are afraid to even consider
the issue because of the various
misconceptions about sororities.
These misconceptions range
from ideas like, "sororities
monopolize fraternity func
tions," to "sororities create in
tense competition among wo
men," and many more.
Of course ideas like this can be
true, but just as all fat people
aren't jolly, all sororities don't
follow one single pattern. First
of all, with so many housing op
tions available to students today,
it is difficult to conceive of
sororities being so popular that
they would be the dominant
housing preference for women
on this campus.
Just as fraternities are prefer
red by some men, and not by
others, many women would
probably be happier staying in
co-ed housing, thus competition
would be no greater than it is for
fraternities.
During the 1940s and 1950s
when fraternities and sororities
were at the peak of their popular
ity at co-ed colleges and univer
sities, men and women needed

an institution through which
they could meet and"court."
Today, male-female encoun
ters and relationships are not
governed by a strict social
framework, but are more open
and relaxed. Hence, the function
of sororities would not be to pro
vide a means by which women
could meet "frat men," but to
allow women to experience the
same growth and responsibility
men experience through frater
nities.
Perhaps, indeed, sororities
have no place at Stanford today,
but then, neither do fraternities.
Few, however, are as vehe
mently opposed to the existence
of fraternities as they are to the
existence of sororities. Certainly
sororities and fraternities are not
for everyone, but if men have the
opportunity to choose between a
fraternity and other types of
housing at Stanford, women
should enjoy the same right.

KZSU concert
KZSU's Tuesday, May 3 noon
concert on Tresidder back patio
was the best example of noise
pollution 1 have ever heard. One
certainly could not call what
transpired there music. It was
much too loud and wrong to be
called that.
It was impossible for me to
walk from the Tresidder lobby to
the Store without covering my
ears. Even with that there was

some discomfort from the loud
noise. My ears suffered from its
effects late into the evening.
What surprised me more than
anything was that people were
actually listening to what was
being performed without any
signs of disagreement. They
even applauded between num
bers.
At 24,1 do not consider myself
an old person. But if listening to
that garbage at eardrum bursting

housing at Stanford, women

KZSU concert
KZSU's Tuesday, May 3 noon
concert on Tresidder back patio
was the best example of noise
pollution 1 have ever heard. One
certainly could not call what
transpired there music. It was
much too loud and wrong to be
called that.
It was impossible for me to
walk from the Tresidder lobby to
the Store without covering my
ears. Even with that there was

some discomfort from the loud
noise. My ears suffered from its
effects late into the evening.
What surprised me more than
anything was that people were
actually listening to what was
being performed without any
signs of disagreement. They
even applauded between num
bers.
At 24,1 do not consider myself
an old person. But if listening to
that garbage at eardrum bursting
levels is what it takes to be
young, I qualify for the geriatric
ward. I would prefer to be old
rather than have my right to go
safely from one building to
another infringed upon by that
loud mess.
1 am a great fan of rock music
and have attended many noon
concerts, but it cannot possibly
be healthy to listen to what I
heard the other day on the back
patio. I am concerned that my
generation may well be on its
way to becoming a generation of
deaf people, if we are not that
already.
1 know that noontime enter
tainment is a big thing here but
K/.SU should find a better way to
use its money. They should
sponsor parties in the evening
and hire better groups to play
longer instead of getting some
two bit flops to come over and
turn their amplifiers all the way
up to hide their lack of talent for
an hour.

Sororities
Should the University repeal
the 35-year-old ban on sororities?
While the Stanford Board of
Trustees is examining this issue,
students are also questioning the
need for sororities on this cam
pus. Many claim that since men
have the option of selective
housing, women, too, should
have the same right.
Others feel that there is no
longer a need for sororities, and
that their reinstitution would
cause more problems than
they'd be worth. Perhaps there
no longer is a practical need for
sororities, for our society no
longer governs the way in which
men and women should interact.
Sororities have, however,
many more desirable aspects
than most people realize. Be
cause of the many misconcep
tions about sororities, though,
sororities have a stigma about
them that people from
seeing them in a positive light.
Because any evaluation of the
advantages of a sorority (or
fraternity) is subject to personal
preference, it is difficult to out
line distinct advantages a soror
ity (or fraternity) has over other
types of housing.
The first that might come to
mind is the option men have
here to rush a fraternity if they
get a bad number in the draw.
Although they are not assured of
getting into the fraternity of their
choice, they at least have the op

tion of trying; sororities would
offer women the same option.
Fraternities also afford men
the opportunity to stay on cam
pus during their unguaranteed
year, an opportunity which
women do not have available.
Many women, though they
might like the idea of having
sororities on campus and feel
that women should have the
same housing opportunities as
men, are afraid to even consider
the issue because of the various
misconceptions about sororities.
These misconceptions range
from ideas like, "sororities
monopolize fraternity func
tions," to "sororities create in
tense competition among wo
men," and many more.
Of course ideas like this can be
true, but just as all fat people
aren't jolly, all sororities don't
follow one single pattern. First
of all, with so many housing op
tions available to students today,
it is difficult to conceive of
sororities being so popular that
they would be the dominant
housing preference for women
on this campus.
Just as fraternities are prefer
red by some men, and not by
others, many women would
probably be happier staying in
co-ed housing, thus competition
would be no greater than it is for
fraternities.
During the 1940s and 1950s
when fraternities and sororities
were at the peak of their popular
ity at co-ed colleges and univer
sities, men and women needed

an institution through which
they could meet and"court."
Today, male-female encoun
ters and relationships are not
governed by a strict social
framework, but are more open
and relaxed. Hence, the function
of sororities would not be to pro
vide a means by which women
could meet "frat men," but to
allow women to experience the
same growth and responsibility
men experience through frater
nities.
Perhaps, indeed, sororities
have no place at Stanford today,
but then, neither do fraternities.
Few, however, are as vehe
mently opposed to the existence
of fraternities as they are to the
existence of sororities. Certainly
sororities and fraternities are not
for everyone, but if men have the
opportunity to choose between a
fraternity and other types of
housing at Stanford, women
should enjoy the same right.
