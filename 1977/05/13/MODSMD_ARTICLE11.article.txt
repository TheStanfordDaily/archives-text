# Apartheid questions need discussion
##

Moravscik, Zasada

The question under debate
this week is unfortunately more
complex than "apartheid means
profit and Stanford won't stop
it." Such arguments are mean
ingless and do not gain in depth
by being chanted in crowds. Our
protesters would do well to read
the statement by the Board of
Trustees (Daily. May 11), which
despite its similar lack of sub
stance, contains one essential
point: no one argues in favor of
apartheid in South Africa; the
problem is to adjust our invest
ment policy to peacefully expe
dite majority rule. The issue is
not one of strategy, but of tactics.
It is high time, therefore, to
begin asking the basic questions
which have been ignored by
both sides.
Overriding question
Given our common purpose,
then, the overriding question
becomes: should U.S. com
panies continue or withdraw in
vestments in South Africa? A
corollary question immediately
arises. Who gets the profits from
these investments?
If U.S. companies benefit out
rageously, the question becomes
moral: do we have the right to
exploit apartheid for our profit?
If the white South Africans
profit the most, we must inquire
again into morality, and ask also
if stabilizing their economy
causes more repression, less rep
ression, or prevents bloody re
volution.
If the blacks themselves profit
substantially as laborers, would
we be doing them a favor by in
creasing already considerable
unemployment, hunger, and
tension? There is a recession in
South Africa right now, and hit
ting such labor intensive indus
tries as automobile assembly
might result in real human suf
fering.
The very morality of pulling
out is unclear, and the trustees'

supposed amorality in failing to
act is even more unclear.
If the impact would be great,
we must ask who it would hurt
and who it would help. If it
would hurt primarily the white
South Africans, do we really
want to promote disintegration
and destabilization within their
economy? If it would hurt
primarily the blacks, do we re
ally want to increase hunger,
hate, and push the unemployed
toward revolution?
Psychological effect
And what would be the
psychological effect on the
white South Africans them
selves? It has been argued that by
showing our disapproval, we
would push them toward re
form. But might not our disap
proval cut two ways? There is no
evidence that previous boycot
ting and blockading have
ameliorated apartheid in South
Africa.Under such conditions
might they shun foreign
mediators and step up repres
sion?
And what if we would simply
be increasing tensions within
the country? To the oppressed,
nothing breeds hate like hunger.
To the oppressor, nothing makes
for obstinance like a threat.
Would we be pushing reform or
revolution. Can anyone on either
side answer this question? If
withdrawing U.S. investments
would simply hasten revolution,
we should take a look at some
other African nations where
such revolutions have occurred.
None are democratic, none are
liberal.
Examine the totalitarian re
gimes and the crippled econ
mies, and ask if they are worth
toppling a government which
has at least an ostensible stabil
ity and pretensions to liberality.
Would revolution lead to major
ity rule or dictatorship? Can we
know? Dare we push for revolu-

tion if we don't? Racism is not
the only way to deny equality,
nd not always the most insidi
ous.
Beyond rhetoric
Many of us have not yet taken
sides on these issues. The protes
ters have drawn needed atten
tion but have failed to go beyond
rhetoric and produce convinc
ing facts. The trustees have been
just as delinquent by keeping the
issue out of the public limelight
and sticking adamantly to their
abstention. The colum
nists have showered us with the
same prolix nonsense that they
use to denounce kidporn.
This is a university, sup
posedly a place of reason and of

research. It is time to employ a
little of both. Where are our
economists? Where are our
political scientists? Where are
our thinkers, now that we need
them?
Those of us caught in the mid
dle of these verbal storms ask
only for a little enlightened dis
cussion, perhaps one or two in
telligent arguments on the edito
rial page. We ask only that the
issues be treated on their merits
and not on their emotional im
pact. But perhaps we ask too
much.
