# The 						thrill of it all!
## Alpine Club 'revitalized' 
### Michael Reedy 
Here I urn, tuut at the end of u
rope, standing on top of a pre
cipice which hangs over empty
spuce. 1 (im supposed to descend
through this void to the solid
firmament below.
I cunnot go back up. Once
sturted, I must continue. / pause
to summon an irrational im
pulse. And then like a good
Stanford student I go for it.
All hope rests with my waist
harness and the rope encircling
me. Upon moving away from the
supporting rock, I am surprised
to find the task relatively simple.
My weight is easily held by the
rope which my hand controls. I
descend, lacking grace, but gain
ing confidence.
What is this activity? It is rap
pelling and is carried out
through the sponsorship and
guidance of the revitalized Stan
ford Alpine Club.
Geared by a nucleus of in
terested students from Colorado,
the Alpine Club this spring wel
comed a firm base of students
(about 65), ranging from rank
amateurs to experienced clim
bers.
It is a mixture that president
Jim Collins hopes will ensure the
club's continuance. The Alpine
Club members of the past couple
of years were by most definitions
an "extinct" species.
Elitist attitude
"The members were good
climbers that went out on their
own. They had an elitist attitude
that discouraged beginners from
joining," Collins said in an in
terview.
He said he hopes the present
club structure will be able to
cater to both beginning and ad
vanced rock climbers.
"We are stressing safety.
Equipment standards have im
proved exponentially over the
past few years, but we still want
the members to be aware of their
responsibility to one another,"
Collins said.
These safety aspects include
tying knots, knowing every
body's position and belaying.
Belaying?
Belaying
Belaying is an essential part of
rock climbing. It is a roping
technique in which one person
supports someone 1 climbing by
keeping a firm grip on a taut
rope. It does not involved pul
ling a person upa mountainside,
but is used only as a safety de

vice to lessen the length and im
pact of a fall.
Proper belaying means the be
layer must be anchored to a posi
tion and capable of holding the
load on the rope to the minimal
fall, which should not be more
than a few feet.
As a test of capabilities, the
club officers recently set up a be
laying tower at San Francisquito
Creek. Two ropes around a tree
limb held a shopping cart that
carried a slab of rock weighing
nearly 100 lbs.
Falling cart
Club members, secured from
behind by ropes and harness,
took turns catching the falling
cart. The belayer held one rope
while about eight people
grasped the other rope. When
the eight people let go, the one
had to maintain his grip.
Being anchored from behind
and pulled from the front gives
the body a sudden schizop
hrenic tug, but all members
proved capable of withstanding
the pressure. They had to if they
wanted to go on club climbing
expeditions.
The Alpine Club hopes to do
more than climb, though. Next
year's planned activities include
backpacking, mountaineering

and nordic skiing.
For all this, plus rappelling
and belaying, there is a yearly
membership fee of about $20.
The fees are used mainly for club
equipment, but also finance film
rentals and organizational ex
penses.
Week-end excursions and per
sonal equipment is a separate
matter, but still not expensive.
Collins estimates $7 to $10 per
person for weekends, depending
on what they eat and where they
go. He feels a beginner need not
spend more than $20 as an initial
investment.
The pay-off
What is the pay-off? What
makes the hard day's effort and
struggle worthwhile?
In response to the question
"Why do you climb?" Collins
thought it over and replied. "Not
because it's there. It's personal
satisfaction, and a feeling un
ique from success in any other
sport," he said.
"It's individual effort; but it's
also a feeling of camaraderie
with your fellow climbers. This
feeling is enhanced by the
dangerand the height. You get to
the top and you're tired as hell.
But you look around, and you
feel great," Collins said.

"You can't wait to get your
hands on a beer. You do it once
and you can't wait to climb
again. You become a climbing
nerd without much effort. You
then climb at every opportunity,
and it can become quite competi
tive. But we try to avoid that."
And what's the most challeng
ing aspect of rock climbing? Col
lins concluded that "the tough
est way up is the most appealing.
This may mean a route no one
else has conquered."
Right to name
One reward of success on a
virgin path to the summit is the
subsequent bestowal of the right
to name the slope.
Collins has encountered such
paths as "Psycho," "The Naked
Edge," "The Grand Giraffe,"
"Death and Transfiguration"
and "Pbsitively 4th Street."
"Most are named on the spur
of the moment," Collins said,
"and often with a song or movie
as the source of inspiration."
Like other aspects of rock
climbing, it is a personal thing.
And in conjunction with the
group spirit, it provides a very
personal feeling of satisfaction.
It is an attitude engendered by
those famous last words: "go for
it."

backpacking, mountaineering

and nordic skiing.
For all this, plus rappelling
and belaying, there is a yearly
membership fee of about $20.
The fees are used mainly for club
equipment, but also finance film
rentals and organizational ex
penses.
Week-end excursions and per
sonal equipment is a separate
matter, but still not expensive.
Collins estimates $7 to $10 per
person for weekends, depending
on what they eat and where they
go. He feels a beginner need not
spend more than $20 as an initial
investment.
The pay-off
What is the pay-off? What
makes the hard day's effort and
struggle worthwhile?
In response to the question
"Why do you climb?" Collins
thought it over and replied. "Not
because it's there. It's personal
satisfaction, and a feeling un
ique from success in any other
sport," he said.
"It's individual effort; but it's
also a feeling of camaraderie
with your fellow climbers. This
feeling is enhanced by the
dangerand the height. You get to
the top and you're tired as hell.
But you look around, and you
feel great," Collins said.

"You can't wait to get your
hands on a beer. You do it once
and you can't wait to climb
again. You become a climbing
nerd without much effort. You
then climb at every opportunity,
and it can become quite competi
tive. But we try to avoid that."
And what's the most challeng
ing aspect of rock climbing? Col
lins concluded that "the tough
est way up is the most appealing.
This may mean a route no one
else has conquered."
Right to name
One reward of success on a
virgin path to the summit is the
subsequent bestowal of the right
to name the slope.
Collins has encountered such
paths as "Psycho," "The Naked
Edge," "The Grand Giraffe,"
"Death and Transfiguration"
and "Pbsitively 4th Street."
"Most are named on the spur
of the moment," Collins said,
"and often with a song or movie
as the source of inspiration."
Like other aspects of rock
climbing, it is a personal thing.
And in conjunction with the
group spirit, it provides a very
personal feeling of satisfaction.
It is an attitude engendered by
those famous last words: "go for
it."
Here I urn, tuut at the end of u
rope, standing on top of a pre

All hope rests with my waist

to find the task relatively simple.

What is this activity? It is rap
pelling and is carried out
through the sponsorship and
guidance of the revitalized Stan
ford Alpine Club.
Geared by a nucleus of in
terested students from Colorado,
the Alpine Club this spring wel
comed a firm base of students
(about 65), ranging from rank
amateurs to experienced clim
bers.
It is a mixture that president
Jim Collins hopes will ensure the
club's continuance. The Alpine
Club members of the past couple
of years were by most definitions
an "extinct" species.
Elitist attitude
"The members were good
climbers that went out on their
own. They had an elitist attitude
that discouraged beginners from
joining," Collins said in an in
terview.
He said he hopes the present
club structure will be able to
cater to both beginning and ad
vanced rock climbers.
"We are stressing safety.
Equipment standards have im
proved exponentially over the
past few years, but we still want
the members to be aware of their
responsibility to one another,"
Collins said.
These safety aspects include
tying knots, knowing every
body's position and belaying.
Belaying?
Belaying
Belaying is an essential part of
rock climbing. It is a roping
technique in which one person
supports someone 1 climbing by
keeping a firm grip on a taut
rope. It does not involved pul
ling a person upa mountainside,
but is used only as a safety de

vice to lessen the length and im
pact of a fall.
Proper belaying means the be
layer must be anchored to a posi
tion and capable of holding the
load on the rope to the minimal
fall, which should not be more
than a few feet.
As a test of capabilities, the
club officers recently set up a be
laying tower at San Francisquito
Creek. Two ropes around a tree
limb held a shopping cart that
carried a slab of rock weighing
nearly 100 lbs.
Falling cart
Club members, secured from
behind by ropes and harness,
took turns catching the falling
cart. The belayer held one rope
while about eight people
grasped the other rope. When
the eight people let go, the one
had to maintain his grip.
Being anchored from behind
and pulled from the front gives
the body a sudden schizop
hrenic tug, but all members
proved capable of withstanding
the pressure. They had to if they
wanted to go on club climbing
expeditions.
The Alpine Club hopes to do
more than climb, though. Next

the Alpine Club this spring wel
comed a firm base of students
(about 65), ranging from rank
amateurs to experienced clim
bers.
It is a mixture that president
Jim Collins hopes will ensure the
club's continuance. The Alpine
Club members of the past couple
of years were by most definitions
an "extinct" species.
Elitist attitude
"The members were good
climbers that went out on their
own. They had an elitist attitude
that discouraged beginners from
joining," Collins said in an in
terview.
He said he hopes the present
club structure will be able to
cater to both beginning and ad
vanced rock climbers.
"We are stressing safety.
Equipment standards have im
proved exponentially over the
past few years, but we still want
the members to be aware of their
responsibility to one another,"
Collins said.
These safety aspects include
tying knots, knowing every
body's position and belaying.
Belaying?
Belaying
Belaying is an essential part of
rock climbing. It is a roping
technique in which one person
supports someone 1 climbing by
keeping a firm grip on a taut
rope. It does not involved pul
ling a person upa mountainside,
but is used only as a safety de

vice to lessen the length and im
pact of a fall.
Proper belaying means the be
layer must be anchored to a posi
tion and capable of holding the
load on the rope to the minimal
fall, which should not be more
than a few feet.
As a test of capabilities, the
club officers recently set up a be
laying tower at San Francisquito
Creek. Two ropes around a tree
limb held a shopping cart that
carried a slab of rock weighing
nearly 100 lbs.
Falling cart
Club members, secured from
behind by ropes and harness,
took turns catching the falling
cart. The belayer held one rope
while about eight people
grasped the other rope. When
the eight people let go, the one
had to maintain his grip.
Being anchored from behind
and pulled from the front gives
the body a sudden schizop
hrenic tug, but all members
proved capable of withstanding
the pressure. They had to if they
wanted to go on club climbing
expeditions.
The Alpine Club hopes to do
more than climb, though. Next
year's planned activities include
backpacking, mountaineering

and nordic skiing.
For all this, plus rappelling
and belaying, there is a yearly
membership fee of about $20.
The fees are used mainly for club
equipment, but also finance film
rentals and organizational ex
penses.
Week-end excursions and per
sonal equipment is a separate
matter, but still not expensive.
Collins estimates $7 to $10 per
person for weekends, depending
on what they eat and where they
go. He feels a beginner need not
spend more than $20 as an initial
investment.
The pay-off
What is the pay-off? What
makes the hard day's effort and
struggle worthwhile?
In response to the question
"Why do you climb?" Collins
thought it over and replied. "Not
because it's there. It's personal
satisfaction, and a feeling un
ique from success in any other
sport," he said.
"It's individual effort; but it's
also a feeling of camaraderie
with your fellow climbers. This
feeling is enhanced by the
dangerand the height. You get to
the top and you're tired as hell.
But you look around, and you
feel great," Collins said.

"You can't wait to get your
hands on a beer. You do it once
and you can't wait to climb
again. You become a climbing
nerd without much effort. You
then climb at every opportunity,
and it can become quite competi
tive. But we try to avoid that."
And what's the most challeng
ing aspect of rock climbing? Col
lins concluded that "the tough
est way up is the most appealing.
This may mean a route no one
else has conquered."
Right to name
One reward of success on a
virgin path to the summit is the
subsequent bestowal of the right
to name the slope.
Collins has encountered such
paths as "Psycho," "The Naked
Edge," "The Grand Giraffe,"
"Death and Transfiguration"
and "Pbsitively 4th Street."
"Most are named on the spur
of the moment," Collins said,
"and often with a song or movie
as the source of inspiration."
Like other aspects of rock
climbing, it is a personal thing.
And in conjunction with the
group spirit, it provides a very
personal feeling of satisfaction.
It is an attitude engendered by
those famous last words: "go for
it."
Here I urn, tuut at the end of u
rope, standing on top of a pre
cipice which hangs over empty
spuce. 1 (im supposed to descend
through this void to the solid
firmament below.
I cunnot go back up. Once
sturted, I must continue. / pause
to summon an irrational im
pulse. And then like a good
Stanford student I go for it.
All hope rests with my waist
harness and the rope encircling
me. Upon moving away from the
supporting rock, I am surprised
to find the task relatively simple.
My weight is easily held by the
rope which my hand controls. I
descend, lacking grace, but gain
ing confidence.
What is this activity? It is rap
pelling and is carried out
through the sponsorship and
guidance of the revitalized Stan
ford Alpine Club.
