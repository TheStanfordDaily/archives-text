## 
### Bit Sing 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
unanimously endorsed the first re
commendation of the ASSU Task
Force on Tenure and Teaching Quality
calling for every University course to
ho evaluated by students each time it is
offered.
In a resolution submitted by Physics
Prof. Alexander Fetter, the senate en
dorsed "the principle of universal
course evaluation by students" and
urged "its prompt implementation."
The resolution directs the Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) to present a de
tailed proposal to the next senate by
the end of autumn quarter.
The senate's clear mandate on this
issue came as a surprise to many, in
cluding graduate student Larry
Diamond, chairperson of the task
force.
"We fought all year long for this, and
for the past few weeks it looked like
this thing had fallen out among the
faculty," said Diamond after the senate
vote. "What happened today exceeded
our wildest dreams."
President Richard Lyman strongly
endorsed the principle of universal
course evaluations by students, saying
it would be hard to imagine such
evaluations being "totally irrelevant or
unhelpful."
Having mandatory student evalua
tions "would put desirable additional
pressure on faculty to produce other
forms of evaluation, too," said Lyman.
"If it comes down to a popularity con
test, which might very well bethecase,
then the way out is not to reject student
evaluations but to supplement them
with other kinds of evaluations."
This would include faculty peer
evaluations of course reading lists,
said Lyman.
Having student evaluations will
"put the monkey on the back it belongs
on," he said.
Issues to be resolved by C-AAA in
clude whether other evaluative
methods could be used as substitutes
for universal student evaluations.
Some faculty members maintained
that alternative methods must be pro
vided because not all courses arealike.
Another issue will be whether and
how such evaluations should be made
public.
