# The
						mystery behind 'Friday, the thirteenth'

From the Associated Press
Today is the day triskaidekaphobiacs might well
stay in bed.
Not only is it the 13th of May — tris
kaidekaphobia is the fear of the number 13 — but
it's Friday the 13th, regarded by the superstitious
as the unluckiest of days.
In the past, May 13 has been unlucky for people
as various as the Viennese — Napoleon captured
Vienna on May 13, 1809; the Japanese — a night
club fire took 116 lives at Osaka on May 13, 1972;
and Richard Nixon — his limousine was stoned in
Caracas, Venezuela, on May 13,1958, while he was
On a goodwill tour as vice president.
Not all bad
But it has not all been bad. The last battle of the
Civil War was fought on May 13, 1865, at Palo
Pinto, Tex. And while legend has it that it's un
lucky to be born on the 13th, Joe Louis was born on
this day in 1914 in Lexington, Ala., and went on to
be the world heavyweight boxing champion from
1937 to 1949.
So, why all the fuss anyway about Friday and
13?
The belief that Friday is a bad luck day, accord
ing to some lore, stems from Christ's crucifixion on
a Friday.

Legend also has it that sailors hated to begin a
voyage on a Friday. But one Irish folk belief holds
that it is good to die on Friday, be buried on Satur
day and get prayed for on Sunday.
Friday comes from the Anglo Saxon word,
Frigedaeg, which means Frigg's Day. Frigg was the
goddess of love in Norse mythology and, oddly,
Scandanavians once considered Friday their luc
kiest day.
As for 13, some believe it unlucky because that's
the number of persons at The Last Supper.
Norse fable
There is also a Norse fable about a banquet in
Valhalla to which 12 gods were invited. But Loki,
the spirit of evil, came uninvited as the 13th, and as
a result, Bader, a favorite of the gods, was killed.
For those who believe this sort of thing, new
enterprises shouldn't be started on Friday the 13th.
But there are special taboos too: Don't pare your
nails, turn your mattress, get married, visit the sick
or have dinner with 12 other persons — supersti
tion says the first or last to rise from a dinner of 13
will die within 12 months.
There is one luck thing about this Friday the
13th, however. It's the only one this year. Next year
there are two, Jan. 13 and Oct. 13.
