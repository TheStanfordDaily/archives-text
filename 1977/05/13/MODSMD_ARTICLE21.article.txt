## discography/andrew m. moravcsik New Russian recordings technically weak but artistically strong 
### 
Westminster Gold, ABC's
budget Classical label, has just
released a set of performances
previously heard only inside the
USSR. The new ABC recordings,
previously released on Melodya
(the Russian label) between 1963
and 1972, provide the American
listener with his first chance to
hear these Soviet performances.
The sound is not quite up to
American standards: there are
balance problems, and some in
struments seem distant. But
there is nothing serious enough
to worry the normal listener. The
pressings are excellent and the
notes surprisingly comprehen
sive. These are budget releases,
list price $:i.98, but they are easy
to find for less than $3.

Schubert Symphony No 8 in B minor 'Un
finished"
Weber Overture to Oberon
Brahms "Tragic Overture
USSR State Symphony Orchestra
Paul Kleski, conductor
This is a highly original and
exciting recording of Schubert's
immortal work, although
perhaps ultimately unsatisfying.
F'aul Kleski, the Polish con
ductor who died in 1973, had an
extensive career on both sides of
the Iron Curtain. To my know
ledge. his only other recordings
presently available are the
Beethoven symphonies on Mus
ical Heritage.
Kleski manipulates the tempo
with Furtwangler's abandon,
and the effect is striking. He im
parls great energy and conducts
with mature insight and experi
enced control. However, the ba
lance is poor (recording prob
lems?) resulting in lost strings.
The Oberon Overture fails to
catch that Mendelssohnian
fairy-tale quality and the Tragic
Overture is stolid. Woodwind
intonation is occasionally a
problem.
Yet one must return to the
Schubert. Despite weaknesses,
the fluid tempos and the energy

behind them create an impres
sive effect.

Technically and interpreta
tively, the best of the four. Kerer,
one of Russia's most ac
complished non-international
pianists, plays with mature in
sight, while Rozhdestvensky
provides an exciting orchestral
counterpart (all important in this
"symphonic" concerto).
Kerer's interpretation is
middle-of-the-road, without the
stylistic clarity of Arrau or the
splashy Romanticism of Baren
boim. technically, the recording

competes with American budget
labels. The sharp string trills of
the first movement come
through clearly and the piano is
sharp but full.
This new release faces tough
competition. Of the 19 record
ings out, three are budget, in
cluding Fleisher/S/.el 1 and a
supurb Arrau/Giulini. Still, give
this some thought if you are
looking for moderately-priced,
moderately-internreted Brahms.

Among the works of the major
symphonists, Bruckner's Ninth

Symphony is one of the greatest
— and one of the most neglected.
Bruckner died before he could
finish his final work, leaving
only three movements.
Nevertheless, thecompleted sec
tion spans almost an hour, com
municating profound spiritual
emotion. Since the work is rarely
performed in concert. Bruckner
connoisseurs must resort to re
cordings.
Rozhdestvensky presents a
Classical Bruckner in the Dutch
tradition of Jochum and von
Beinem (quick and subtly inci
sive), but without depth. He
often spoils Bruckner's carefully
wrought climaxes with mis
phrasing or untenable tempos
(e.g. the coda of theadagio is too
fast, ruining the ethereal other
worldly spirit).
The Moscow Radio Sym
phony, one of Russia's best, is
uneven. The brass are usually
crisp and powerful (although
they botch some adagio attacks)
but the woodwinds are
lukewarm and the strings cold
and distant.
This release cannot compete
with any of the full-priced re
cordings, The old Jochum set is

still my favorite, while Mehta is
the most exciting. If you like
Romantic Bruckner, watch for
the new Giulini-Chicago release
on Angel. Either of the other av
ailable budget recordings:
Schuricht/Vienna or
Horenstein/Vienna, is a better
buy.
The only advantage to this
Russian set is that it is on two
records — meaning that the
scherzo is not split — but the
buyer pays. The fourth side con
tains a set of 13 orchestrated
choral preludes.

This release plugs a gap in the
market. Unless you want a
three-record set with the com
plete Saint-Saens Piano Concer
tos, you can't buy a recording of
his Septet. This release was orig
inally recorded in hut the
sound is fresh and clear.
The performers exquisitely
capture the varied moods
from frolicking joy to gentle
melancholy. This vernal in
terpretation is marred only by an
overbearing trumpet and a few
piano slips.
The late Darius Milhaud came
to fame as a member of "Les
Six," the group of French
avant-guard composers that in
cluded Poulenc and Honegger.
The Chimney of King Hene is a
fluid and haunting seven
movement suite for woodwind
quintet, written for a movie
about the folk-hero king of Aix
en-Provence.
This release is as good as the
other two on the market. Al
though you might find the East
ern European woodwind sound
a little cold, this is a moving re
ndition especially notable for
wisely chosen tempos and clean
sound.
