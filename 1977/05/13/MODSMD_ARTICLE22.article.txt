## Cards to rise from Pac-8 cellar? UCLA hosts conference track finals 
### Bruce Anderson 
Cardinal cindermen hope to
climb out of the Pacific-8 cellar
for the first time in five years
during the conference finals
today and tomorrow at UCLA's
Drake Stadium.
"This is the best group we've
sent to the l'ac-8 meet in several
years," track coach I'ayton Jor
dan said earlier in the week. "We
intend to get out of the cellar. We
could win two or three firsts and
score in eight or nine events.
"But we still face the same
problem we've had in the past.
We have a thin line of qualified

people, a real lack of numbers."
In addition to a paucity of per
formers, Stanford's top scoring
threat in this weekend's meet,
junior James Lofton, is suffering
from a hamstring twinge.
Lofton, who was counted on to
score in the long jump, the 400
and both relays, injured his
hamstring on his winning jump
in Saturday's West Coast Relays.
The 6-foot-:i sprinter-jumper
worked out all week and said,
"I'll be able to compete all right.
I'm just hoping for the best."
Lofton will not run the 400 but
will compete in both relays and

in the long jump. He has jumped
more than 25 feet in every meet
this season and his 26-9 leap in
Mexico City ranks as the best in
the world this year.
But USC's Larry Doubley and
UCLA's Willie Banks both beat
Lofton in dual meets and prom
ise to give the Card lea per heated
competition.
Lofton in gear
"1 won all my dual meets last
year, but I finished fourth in the
Pac-Bs," Lofton said. "This year 1
geared my training for these
post-season meets."
Lofton is not the only Card to

hold a world-leading mark this
season; shot putter Terry Albrit
ton has the best indoor (70-6V2)
and outdoor (67-9V4) throws this
season. Alhritton appears a
shoe-in to give Stanford 10
points in his specialty.
Junior Alan Sheats also has an
excellent chance to score for
Stanford. The Cardinal sprinter
is one of the top 400-meter run
ners in the conference with a
best of 46.6.
Furlong race
Gordon Banks, a freshman in
his first conference meet, will
challenge the brigade of sprin
ters from southern California in
the 200. Both Banks and Sheats
will join Lofton for the two re
lays.
Junior Tom Shellworth (52.2)
in the intermediate hurdles and
Steve Crowley (3:49.4) in the
1500 will also be in the thick of
the scoring picture in their
events.
Other Stanford athletes in the
meet include Marvin Holmes,
100 meters and the 400-meter re
lay; Dave Wells, 800 meters; Jeff
Parietti, 5000 meters; Bill Gail,
steeplechase; Rick Buss, discus;
Carl Johnk, decathlon, and John
Littleboy, high jump.
While Stanford battles to stay
out of the cellar, USC seeks to
repeat as team champion. Last
year the Trojans set a conference
record by scoring 180 points.
UCLA, strong in the sprints and
field events, and Oregon and
Washington State, both loaded
in the distances, will provide
Southern Cal with competition
for the team title.

A long shot, but not a darkhorse
Shot putter Terry Albritton is heavily favored to win the Pacific-8 shot put crown in the conference
finals this weekend. Albritton's 67-9 1 /4 toss to win the shot in the Big Meet is the best throw in the

junior James Lofton, is suffering
from a hamstring twinge.
Lofton, who was counted on to
score in the long jump, the 400
and both relays, injured his
hamstring on his winning jump
in Saturday's West Coast Relays.
The 6-foot-:i sprinter-jumper
worked out all week and said,
"I'll be able to compete all right.
I'm just hoping for the best."
Lofton will not run the 400 but
will compete in both relays and

in the long jump. He has jumped
more than 25 feet in every meet
this season and his 26-9 leap in
Mexico City ranks as the best in
the world this year.
But USC's Larry Doubley and
UCLA's Willie Banks both beat
Lofton in dual meets and prom
ise to give the Card lea per heated
competition.
Lofton in gear
"1 won all my dual meets last
year, but I finished fourth in the
Pac-Bs," Lofton said. "This year 1
geared my training for these
post-season meets."
Lofton is not the only Card to

hold a world-leading mark this
season; shot putter Terry Albrit
ton has the best indoor (70-6V2)
and outdoor (67-9V4) throws this
season. Alhritton appears a
shoe-in to give Stanford 10
points in his specialty.
Junior Alan Sheats also has an
excellent chance to score for
Stanford. The Cardinal sprinter
is one of the top 400-meter run
ners in the conference with a
best of 46.6.
Furlong race
Gordon Banks, a freshman in
his first conference meet, will
challenge the brigade of sprin
ters from southern California in
the 200. Both Banks and Sheats
will join Lofton for the two re
lays.
Junior Tom Shellworth (52.2)
in the intermediate hurdles and
Steve Crowley (3:49.4) in the
1500 will also be in the thick of
the scoring picture in their
events.
Other Stanford athletes in the
meet include Marvin Holmes,
100 meters and the 400-meter re
lay; Dave Wells, 800 meters; Jeff
Parietti, 5000 meters; Bill Gail,
steeplechase; Rick Buss, discus;
Carl Johnk, decathlon, and John
Littleboy, high jump.
While Stanford battles to stay
out of the cellar, USC seeks to
repeat as team champion. Last
year the Trojans set a conference
record by scoring 180 points.
UCLA, strong in the sprints and
field events, and Oregon and
Washington State, both loaded
in the distances, will provide
Southern Cal with competition
for the team title.

A long shot, but not a darkhorse
Shot putter Terry Albritton is heavily favored to win the Pacific-8 shot put crown in the conference
finals this weekend. Albritton's 67-9 1 /4 toss to win the shot in the Big Meet is the best throw in the
world outdoors this season.
Cardinal cindermen hope to
climb out of the Pacific-8 cellar
for the first time in five years
during the conference finals
today and tomorrow at UCLA's
Drake Stadium.
"This is the best group we've
sent to the l'ac-8 meet in several
years," track coach I'ayton Jor
dan said earlier in the week. "We
intend to get out of the cellar. We
could win two or three firsts and
score in eight or nine events.
"But we still face the same
problem we've had in the past.
We have a thin line of qualified

people, a real lack of numbers."
