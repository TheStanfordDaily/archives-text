# Art Lambert: a coach for all seasons
## 
### Stacy Geiken 
"I have always felt that
the measure of a man's
life is his dedication to
excellence in whatever
he does."
—Art Lambert
Art Lambert is currently the most
successful coach on the Stanford cam
pus.
Since coming to Stanford in the fall
of 1974, Lambert has compiled 55 wins
and only 19 losses in three seasons as
varsity water polo coach. Last year he
led the Cardinals to a three-way tie for
the Pacific-8 crown, while this year
Stanford took the conference title out
right as well as the NCAA champion
ship.
Volleyball has been no less spec
tacular for the Card coach as he led the
team to two Northern California titles
in two years and a berth in the NCAA
regionals this spring.
Lambert's success is not foreign to
him. He played on national champion
ship water polo teams in 1957 and
1959. He was an All-American at San
Jose State as well as at the national
amateur level with the Olympic Club
of San Francisco.
Lambert's intense involvement in
sports since the 1950s started in a
roundabout way.
Chameleon
After graduating from Sequoia High
School in Redwood City, Lambert en
tered San Jose State as an electrical
engineering major. He said he was
"fairly proficient" but not really in
terested. So with his father's advice he
changed to business. Lambert realized
that the martini-for-lunch-bunch was
not up his alley either, so he went to
his mother for advice.
"Finally, 1 came back to my mom

and said, 'No way am 1 gonna do
this,' " Lambert said.
"She said, 'What the hell do you
want to do?' 1 said, i really don't
know.' She said, 'Well you've been
around sports all of your life, try that.'
So 1 went into physical education and 1
have never regretted it since."
After getting his degree, he was
hired as a history teacher and water
polo coach at Await High School in
Mountain View.
Lambert left Await High School in
1966 and went to coach at De Anza
Junior College in Cupertino, where he
became successful on both the na
tional and international levels.
Gold medal coach
While at De Anza, Lambert coached
an American team to a gold medal in
the Fan-American games in 1967 and a
fifth-place finish in the 1968 Olympics
in Mexico City. Lambert was also an
assistant water polo coach in the 1972
Olympics in Munich, Germany, where
the? American team took the bronze
medal. Six of the starting players on
the 1972 Olympic team were from
Lambert's AAU squad.
Between 1965 and 1972, Lambert's
AAU teams won a total of six national
championships.
In 1974, Lambert came to Stanford
and after three successful seasons as
head waterpolo coach, he resigned.
Lambert's decision to leave the Stan
ford water polo program was not a
sudden move.
"I don't particularly care for the di
rection I see it taking," Lambert said.
"1 think it's tragic because there are
so many people interested in the
sport."
Lambert specifically mentioned that
he was dissatisfied with the NCAA and
AAU's handling of the sport.

However, Lambert also mentioned
that he didn't leave the sport without
some regrets.
"One of my regrets ot leaving water
polo is the type of team that we have
right now."
Lambert plans to put a full-time
coaching effort into theStantord men's
and women's volleyball teams next
year.
"The sport itself is only in its infant
stages," Lambert said.
Lambert has carried over some ot the
basic techniques used in his successful
water polo program to volleyball.
One of Lambert's techniques is short
(about two hours), intense workouts.
Pressure cooker
"Sure, 1 put a lot of pressure on my
players, but then they learn to operate
under pressure and to handle pressure
and then they are much more effective
individuals," he said.
"Our practices are intense and there
is a lot of pressure attached to it, but
our players respond very well."
How do the players feel about Lam
bert's coaching methods?
Water polo player Marty Davis said
that Lambert is "probably one of the
best (coaches) in the country
"He knows what he wants from a
team and that's why he puts the pres
sure on in the workouts," Davis said.
Davis also said that the pressure in
workouts helps the team respond
favorably in the actual game situation.
Volleyball player Andy Fishburn
said that the pressure helps to avoid
lapses that, "can make or break the
team."
"As a coach, he is basically excellent
for motivation and getting the team
psyched," Fishburn said.
Lambert is also concerned with the
personal rapport he has with his

athletes.
'1 have a great deal of respect for my
athletes," he said.
"I think that anything is possible.
I he talent (here at Stanford) is great
and you have to have it in order to be
successful."
Lambert's demand for dedication to
excel I is reflected in the dedication
that he has to his athletes. One of the
ways he shows this dedication is in the
programs that he has developed since
coming to Stanford.
Lambert helped to promote the Stan
lord Aquatic Foundation. The Founda
tion is set up to help Stanford students
(present and past) to continue to play
water polo on the AAU level. Lambert
said that most water polo players don't
reach their peak until their late 20s.
"This (the foundation) gives the
graduates a chance to play," Lambert
said.
No one-way trip
"1 am totally wrapped up in them
(the athletes)," he said. "As I am so
fond of telling them 'I'm coming out
here getting you charged up, some
days you gotta charge me up.' "
When the team loses, he does not
take it as a personal loss, nor does he
blame it on the team.
\"I feel it is our fault," Lambert said.
Coach isn't infallible
"I can look back and think of mis
takes that I've made that have hurt us
in my coaching career. 1 can look back
at mistakes that players have made that
hurt us. You know, I'm certainly not
infallible. I make errors too. I just hope
I make less than the players do."
Lambert enjoys coaching because of
the personal satisfaction it gives him
in knowing that he has, along with the
athlete, put forth the best possible ef
fort.

our players respond very well."
How do the players feel about Lam
bert's coaching methods?
Water polo player Marty Davis said
that Lambert is "probably one of the
best (coaches) in the country
"He knows what he wants from a
team and that's why he puts the pres
sure on in the workouts," Davis said.
Davis also said that the pressure in
workouts helps the team respond
favorably in the actual game situation.
Volleyball player Andy Fishburn
said that the pressure helps to avoid
lapses that, "can make or break the
team."
"As a coach, he is basically excellent
for motivation and getting the team
psyched," Fishburn said.
Lambert is also concerned with the
personal rapport he has with his

athletes.
'1 have a great deal of respect for my
athletes," he said.
"I think that anything is possible.
I he talent (here at Stanford) is great
and you have to have it in order to be
successful."
Lambert's demand for dedication to
excel I is reflected in the dedication
that he has to his athletes. One of the
ways he shows this dedication is in the
programs that he has developed since
coming to Stanford.
Lambert helped to promote the Stan
lord Aquatic Foundation. The Founda
tion is set up to help Stanford students
(present and past) to continue to play
water polo on the AAU level. Lambert
said that most water polo players don't
reach their peak until their late 20s.
"This (the foundation) gives the
graduates a chance to play," Lambert
said.
No one-way trip
"1 am totally wrapped up in them
(the athletes)," he said. "As I am so
fond of telling them 'I'm coming out
here getting you charged up, some
days you gotta charge me up.' "
When the team loses, he does not
take it as a personal loss, nor does he
blame it on the team.
\"I feel it is our fault," Lambert said.
Coach isn't infallible
"I can look back and think of mis
takes that I've made that have hurt us
in my coaching career. 1 can look back
at mistakes that players have made that
hurt us. You know, I'm certainly not
infallible. I make errors too. I just hope
I make less than the players do."
Lambert enjoys coaching because of
the personal satisfaction it gives him
in knowing that he has, along with the
athlete, put forth the best possible ef
fort.

Coach Art Lambert led the Cardinals to an NCAA water polo title
but will now concentrate his coaching efforts to volleyball where
he is proving to be equally successful.
"I have always felt that
the measure of a man's
life is his dedication to
excellence in whatever
he does."
—Art Lambert
Art Lambert is currently the most
successful coach on the Stanford cam
pus.
Since coming to Stanford in the fall
of 1974, Lambert has compiled 55 wins
and only 19 losses in three seasons as
varsity water polo coach. Last year he
led the Cardinals to a three-way tie for
the Pacific-8 crown, while this year
Stanford took the conference title out
right as well as the NCAA champion
ship.
Volleyball has been no less spec
tacular for the Card coach as he led the
team to two Northern California titles
in two years and a berth in the NCAA
regionals this spring.
Lambert's success is not foreign to
him. He played on national champion
ship water polo teams in 1957 and
1959. He was an All-American at San
Jose State as well as at the national
amateur level with the Olympic Club
of San Francisco.
Lambert's intense involvement in
sports since the 1950s started in a
roundabout way.
Chameleon
After graduating from Sequoia High
School in Redwood City, Lambert en
tered San Jose State as an electrical
engineering major. He said he was
"fairly proficient" but not really in
terested. So with his father's advice he
changed to business. Lambert realized
that the martini-for-lunch-bunch was
not up his alley either, so he went to
his mother for advice.
"Finally, 1 came back to my mom

and said, 'No way am 1 gonna do
this,' " Lambert said.
"She said, 'What the hell do you
want to do?' 1 said, i really don't
know.' She said, 'Well you've been
around sports all of your life, try that.'
So 1 went into physical education and 1
have never regretted it since."
After getting his degree, he was
hired as a history teacher and water
polo coach at Await High School in
Mountain View.
Lambert left Await High School in
1966 and went to coach at De Anza
Junior College in Cupertino, where he
became successful on both the na
tional and international levels.
Gold medal coach
While at De Anza, Lambert coached
an American team to a gold medal in
the Fan-American games in 1967 and a
fifth-place finish in the 1968 Olympics
in Mexico City. Lambert was also an
assistant water polo coach in the 1972
Olympics in Munich, Germany, where
the? American team took the bronze
medal. Six of the starting players on
the 1972 Olympic team were from
Lambert's AAU squad.
Between 1965 and 1972, Lambert's
AAU teams won a total of six national
championships.
In 1974, Lambert came to Stanford
and after three successful seasons as
head waterpolo coach, he resigned.
Lambert's decision to leave the Stan
ford water polo program was not a
sudden move.
"I don't particularly care for the di
rection I see it taking," Lambert said.
"1 think it's tragic because there are
so many people interested in the
sport."
Lambert specifically mentioned that
he was dissatisfied with the NCAA and
AAU's handling of the sport.

However, Lambert also mentioned
that he didn't leave the sport without
some regrets.
"One of my regrets ot leaving water
polo is the type of team that we have
right now."
Lambert plans to put a full-time
coaching effort into theStantord men's
and women's volleyball teams next
year.
"The sport itself is only in its infant
stages," Lambert said.
Lambert has carried over some ot the
basic techniques used in his successful
water polo program to volleyball.
One of Lambert's techniques is short
(about two hours), intense workouts.
Pressure cooker
"Sure, 1 put a lot of pressure on my
players, but then they learn to operate
under pressure and to handle pressure
and then they are much more effective
individuals," he said.
"Our practices are intense and there
is a lot of pressure attached to it, but
our players respond very well."

and said, 'No way am 1 gonna do
this,' " Lambert said.
"She said, 'What the hell do you
want to do?' 1 said, i really don't
know.' She said, 'Well you've been
around sports all of your life, try that.'
So 1 went into physical education and 1
have never regretted it since."
After getting his degree, he was
hired as a history teacher and water
polo coach at Await High School in
Mountain View.
Lambert left Await High School in
1966 and went to coach at De Anza
Junior College in Cupertino, where he
became successful on both the na
tional and international levels.
Gold medal coach
While at De Anza, Lambert coached
an American team to a gold medal in
the Fan-American games in 1967 and a
fifth-place finish in the 1968 Olympics
in Mexico City. Lambert was also an
assistant water polo coach in the 1972
Olympics in Munich, Germany, where
the? American team took the bronze
medal. Six of the starting players on
the 1972 Olympic team were from
Lambert's AAU squad.
Between 1965 and 1972, Lambert's
AAU teams won a total of six national
championships.
In 1974, Lambert came to Stanford
and after three successful seasons as
head waterpolo coach, he resigned.
Lambert's decision to leave the Stan
ford water polo program was not a
sudden move.
"I don't particularly care for the di
rection I see it taking," Lambert said.
"1 think it's tragic because there are
so many people interested in the
sport."
Lambert specifically mentioned that
he was dissatisfied with the NCAA and
AAU's handling of the sport.

However, Lambert also mentioned
that he didn't leave the sport without
some regrets.
"One of my regrets ot leaving water
polo is the type of team that we have
right now."
Lambert plans to put a full-time
coaching effort into theStantord men's
and women's volleyball teams next
year.
"The sport itself is only in its infant
stages," Lambert said.
Lambert has carried over some ot the
basic techniques used in his successful
water polo program to volleyball.
One of Lambert's techniques is short
(about two hours), intense workouts.
Pressure cooker
"Sure, 1 put a lot of pressure on my
players, but then they learn to operate
under pressure and to handle pressure
and then they are much more effective
individuals," he said.
"Our practices are intense and there
is a lot of pressure attached to it, but
our players respond very well."
How do the players feel about Lam
bert's coaching methods?
Water polo player Marty Davis said
that Lambert is "probably one of the
best (coaches) in the country
"He knows what he wants from a
team and that's why he puts the pres
sure on in the workouts," Davis said.
Davis also said that the pressure in
workouts helps the team respond
favorably in the actual game situation.
Volleyball player Andy Fishburn
said that the pressure helps to avoid
lapses that, "can make or break the
team."
"As a coach, he is basically excellent
for motivation and getting the team
psyched," Fishburn said.
Lambert is also concerned with the
personal rapport he has with his

athletes.
'1 have a great deal of respect for my
athletes," he said.
"I think that anything is possible.
I he talent (here at Stanford) is great
and you have to have it in order to be
successful."
Lambert's demand for dedication to
excel I is reflected in the dedication
that he has to his athletes. One of the
ways he shows this dedication is in the
programs that he has developed since
coming to Stanford.
Lambert helped to promote the Stan
lord Aquatic Foundation. The Founda
tion is set up to help Stanford students
(present and past) to continue to play
water polo on the AAU level. Lambert
said that most water polo players don't
reach their peak until their late 20s.
"This (the foundation) gives the
graduates a chance to play," Lambert
said.
No one-way trip
"1 am totally wrapped up in them
(the athletes)," he said. "As I am so
fond of telling them 'I'm coming out
here getting you charged up, some
days you gotta charge me up.' "
When the team loses, he does not
take it as a personal loss, nor does he
blame it on the team.
\"I feel it is our fault," Lambert said.
Coach isn't infallible
"I can look back and think of mis
takes that I've made that have hurt us
in my coaching career. 1 can look back
at mistakes that players have made that
hurt us. You know, I'm certainly not
infallible. I make errors too. I just hope
I make less than the players do."
Lambert enjoys coaching because of
the personal satisfaction it gives him
in knowing that he has, along with the
athlete, put forth the best possible ef
fort.

Coach Art Lambert led the Cardinals to an NCAA water polo title
but will now concentrate his coaching efforts to volleyball where
he is proving to be equally successful.
"I have always felt that
the measure of a man's
life is his dedication to
excellence in whatever
he does."
—Art Lambert
Art Lambert is currently the most
successful coach on the Stanford cam
pus.
Since coming to Stanford in the fall
of 1974, Lambert has compiled 55 wins
and only 19 losses in three seasons as
varsity water polo coach. Last year he
led the Cardinals to a three-way tie for
the Pacific-8 crown, while this year
Stanford took the conference title out
right as well as the NCAA champion
ship.
Volleyball has been no less spec
tacular for the Card coach as he led the
team to two Northern California titles
in two years and a berth in the NCAA
regionals this spring.
Lambert's success is not foreign to
him. He played on national champion
ship water polo teams in 1957 and
1959. He was an All-American at San
Jose State as well as at the national
amateur level with the Olympic Club
of San Francisco.
Lambert's intense involvement in
sports since the 1950s started in a
roundabout way.
Chameleon
After graduating from Sequoia High
School in Redwood City, Lambert en
tered San Jose State as an electrical
engineering major. He said he was
"fairly proficient" but not really in
terested. So with his father's advice he
changed to business. Lambert realized
that the martini-for-lunch-bunch was
not up his alley either, so he went to
his mother for advice.
"Finally, 1 came back to my mom

and said, 'No way am 1 gonna do
this,' " Lambert said.
