# S. Africa protesters hold 'reflective' rally
## 
### Bill Burger 
More than 400 people gathered in
the Old Union courtyard yesterday at
noon to participate in "a day of reflec
tion" on the past week's events. Later
in the afternoon. President Richard
Lyman said many of t he trustees resent
what they consider to be "blatant at
tempts to misrepresent their position."
The protesters have portrayed the
Hoard of Trustees' position "as one
that is tolerant of apartheid and of ra
cism, and one that is motivated by cor
porate greed," said Lyman at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
"As one of the younger members put
it on Tuesday, 'We are being handed a
bump rap,' " Lyman added.
"The issue," said Lyman, "is not one
of principle but of tactics: what path of
action relating to the proxy vote is
most likely to have a constructive ef
fect, given the objective of moving
away from apartheid and towards ra
cial justice in South Africa?"
Coleman criticized
Chris Coleman, an organizer of the
Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP), "showed
so little interest in anything other than
the decision not to change the absten
tion on the Ford proxy as to lead both
Mr. Rosenzweig (vice president for
public affairs) . . . and me to ask him
whether the other three demands had
ever had any real meaning," said Ly
man.
After speaking of the reasons
prompting the University's decision to
have the protesters arrested Monday
night, Lyman said, "There was not
even any discussion between the de

monstrators and the University's rep
resentatives of allowing the protesters
to remain in unmolested occupancy oi
the building all night.
"The protesters themselves clearly
wanted to be arrested, as the best
means available to them to de
monstrate the strength of their convic
tions."
Lyman also announced that 270 of
the 294 protesters arrested in Mon
day's sit-in at the Old Union were stu
dents here.
Lyman quoted Coleman as telling
him over the phone Monday night.
"I've got 400 people here who came to
be arrested."
Coleman was out of town yesterday
evening and unavailable for comment.
COP statement
In a statement released to the Daily
last night, the ASSIJ Council of Presi
dents said, "Certain aspects of his
(Lyman's) presentation were insults to
all of us who, because of our moral
convictions participated in the recent
protests to end Stanford's complicity
in South Africa's racist and exploita
tive labor control system."
SCRIP's organization and handling
of the rally "was an exemplary case of
democratic civil disobedience," the
statement declared. "Furthermore, the
rally served not only to educate the
public, hut also as a focal point for
current concern for racism and apar
theid in South Africa."
In Detroit yesterday, the Lord Motor
Co. stockholder resolution calling for
the company's withdrawal from South
Africa met an overwhelming defeat.
Approximately 112 million votes, or

9H.19 per cent of those cast yesterday
were voted against the resolution.
About two million votes were re
corded in favor of the withdrawal.
Profits
Ford announced profits of $98;i
million for 1976. This figure marks an
over 300 per cent increase of the re
corded profits for 1975. The com
pany's total world sales for the year
were about $29 billion, according to

Peter Young of Ford's public relations
department.
At the rally here, protester Andrew
Goldenkranz read SCRIP'S reply to the
board's statement, published in Wed
nesday s Daily.
According to SCRIP'S statement,
"Demonstrators against the trustee ac
tions committed a nonviolent act of
civil disobedience as a last resort only

African investments were arrested Monday night, became the site of yet
another demonstration yesterday as protesters gathered to reflect on the
week's events. Meanwhile, President Richard Lyman said the administra

to South Africa.
