# S. Africa protesters hold 'reflective' rally
## 
### Bill Burger 
More than 400 people gathered in
the Old Union courtyard yesterday at
noon to participate in "a day of reflec
tion" on the past week's events. Later
in the afternoon. President Richard
Lyman said many of t he trustees resent
what they consider to be "blatant at
tempts to misrepresent their position."
The protesters have portrayed the
Hoard of Trustees' position "as one
that is tolerant of apartheid and of ra
cism, and one that is motivated by cor
porate greed," said Lyman at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
"As one of the younger members put
it on Tuesday, 'We are being handed a
bump rap,' " Lyman added.
"The issue," said Lyman, "is not one
of principle but of tactics: what path of
action relating to the proxy vote is
most likely to have a constructive ef
fect, given the objective of moving
away from apartheid and towards ra
cial justice in South Africa?"
Coleman criticized
Chris Coleman, an organizer of the
Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP), "showed
so little interest in anything other than
the decision not to change the absten
tion on the Ford proxy as to lead both
Mr. Rosenzweig (vice president for
public affairs) . . . and me to ask him
whether the other three demands had
ever had any real meaning," said Ly
man.
After speaking of the reasons
prompting the University's decision to
have the protesters arrested Monday
night, Lyman said, "There was not
even any discussion between the de

monstrators and the University's rep
resentatives of allowing the protesters
to remain in unmolested occupancy oi
the building all night.
"The protesters themselves clearly
wanted to be arrested, as the best
means available to them to de
monstrate the strength of their convic
tions."
Lyman also announced that 270 of
the 294 protesters arrested in Mon
day's sit-in at the Old Union were stu
dents here.
Lyman quoted Coleman as telling
him over the phone Monday night.
"I've got 400 people here who came to
be arrested."
Coleman was out of town yesterday
evening and unavailable for comment.
COP statement
In a statement released to the Daily
last night, the ASSIJ Council of Presi
dents said, "Certain aspects of his
(Lyman's) presentation were insults to
all of us who, because of our moral
convictions participated in the recent
protests to end Stanford's complicity
in South Africa's racist and exploita
tive labor control system."
SCRIP's organization and handling
of the rally "was an exemplary case of
democratic civil disobedience," the
statement declared. "Furthermore, the
rally served not only to educate the
public, hut also as a focal point for
current concern for racism and apar
theid in South Africa."
In Detroit yesterday, the Lord Motor
Co. stockholder resolution calling for
the company's withdrawal from South
Africa met an overwhelming defeat.
Approximately 112 million votes, or

9H.19 per cent of those cast yesterday
were voted against the resolution.
About two million votes were re
corded in favor of the withdrawal.
Profits
Ford announced profits of $98;i
million for 1976. This figure marks an
over 300 per cent increase of the re
corded profits for 1975. The com
pany's total world sales for the year
were about $29 billion, according to

Peter Young of Ford's public relations
department.
At the rally here, protester Andrew
Goldenkranz read SCRIP'S reply to the
board's statement, published in Wed
nesday s Daily.
According to SCRIP'S statement,

tions committed a nonviolent act of

Old Union, where 294 persons protesting the University's position on South
African investments were arrested Monday night, became the site of yet
another demonstration yesterday as protesters gathered to reflect on the
week's events. Meanwhile, President Richard Lyman said the administra
tion and Board of Trustees have been "handed a bum rap" by critics of the
University's abstention on a Ford Motor Co. stockholder resolution relating
to South Africa.
after every other channel had been
exhausted. It was forced communica
tion in a time of no communication."
The statement*also said, "We got
through; on the other hand we should
not need to sit-in every time that we
feel the need to communicate. We be
lieve that progress has been made . . .
and hope that with mutual good will
and confidence a new and more un
derstanding relationship can de
velop."
Banner unfurled
The rally opened with the unfurling
of a banner from the third floor of the
Old Union acknowledging the support
of UC-Berkeley students for the anti
apartheid movement here.
Statements of support from Cesar
Chavez, the Santa Clara Ghicano Stu
dents, the Associated Students of San
Jose State University, and the Chicano
Affairs Office at Santa Clara were read
to the group.
French Prof. Raymond Ciraud told
the crowd a faculty support committee
for protesters had been in existence
since last weekend. Ciraud said the
committee will issue a support state
ment this weekend.
Ciraud then urged students to help
gather more faculty signatures sup
porting the protesters.
"Abstention is the sort of vote which
is a failure to take a stand," said
Ciraud. "A yes vote is the only vote
that could be consistent with our

group's principles."
Speaking "for all of the people who
have worked so hard to bring us to the
point we are at today," Carol Olney
said, "our energy is flowing; it can't be
shut off."
Olney continued, "But we should
also mourn. In essence, the trustees
voted . . . for the perpetuation of a ra
cist and murderous apartheid gov
ernment. Today, moral investment
policy saw its death, as did freedom,
justiceand human life in South Africa.
"We stand as one and celebrate not
only our current unity, but also our
growing strength. Our hope is now to
educate and activate the whole Stan
ford community."
The crowd also heard a statement of
support from Tim Smith, a member of
the Interfaith Center on Corporate Re
sponsibility. Smith's statement was
recorded in a telephone interview
from Detroit where he read a statement
at the Ford shareholder meeting yes
terday denouncing the University's
abstention on the withdrawal resolu
tion.
Actions taken by protesters at Stan
ford are extremely important, said
Smith. The actions not only express
community concern, he said, they also
are "a very clear message to the South
African government that a significant
number of Americans care about ra
cism there."
Whether the University votes one
way or the other, he said, "is not the

only issue here" because the students
and faculty members "have done
something that is important in 1977"
just by organizing and voicing their
opinions.
The rally ended at about 12:45 p.m.

Old Union, where 294 persons protesting the University's position on South
African investments were arrested Monday night, became the site of yet
another demonstration yesterday as protesters gathered to reflect on the
week's events. Meanwhile, President Richard Lyman said the administra
tion and Board of Trustees have been "handed a bum rap" by critics of the
University's abstention on a Ford Motor Co. stockholder resolution relating
to South Africa.
after every other channel had been
exhausted. It was forced communica
tion in a time of no communication."
The statement*also said, "We got
through; on the other hand we should
not need to sit-in every time that we
feel the need to communicate. We be
lieve that progress has been made . . .
and hope that with mutual good will
and confidence a new and more un
derstanding relationship can de
velop."
Banner unfurled
The rally opened with the unfurling
of a banner from the third floor of the
Old Union acknowledging the support
of UC-Berkeley students for the anti
apartheid movement here.
Statements of support from Cesar
Chavez, the Santa Clara Ghicano Stu
dents, the Associated Students of San
Jose State University, and the Chicano
Affairs Office at Santa Clara were read
to the group.
French Prof. Raymond Ciraud told
the crowd a faculty support committee
for protesters had been in existence
since last weekend. Ciraud said the
committee will issue a support state
ment this weekend.
Ciraud then urged students to help
gather more faculty signatures sup
porting the protesters.
"Abstention is the sort of vote which
is a failure to take a stand," said
Ciraud. "A yes vote is the only vote
that could be consistent with our

group's principles."
Speaking "for all of the people who
have worked so hard to bring us to the
point we are at today," Carol Olney
said, "our energy is flowing; it can't be
shut off."
Olney continued, "But we should
also mourn. In essence, the trustees
voted . . . for the perpetuation of a ra
cist and murderous apartheid gov
ernment. Today, moral investment
policy saw its death, as did freedom,
justiceand human life in South Africa.
"We stand as one and celebrate not
only our current unity, but also our
growing strength. Our hope is now to
educate and activate the whole Stan
ford community."
The crowd also heard a statement of
support from Tim Smith, a member of
the Interfaith Center on Corporate Re
sponsibility. Smith's statement was
recorded in a telephone interview
from Detroit where he read a statement
at the Ford shareholder meeting yes
terday denouncing the University's
abstention on the withdrawal resolu
tion.
Actions taken by protesters at Stan
ford are extremely important, said
Smith. The actions not only express
community concern, he said, they also
are "a very clear message to the South
African government that a significant
number of Americans care about ra
cism there."
Whether the University votes one
way or the other, he said, "is not the

only issue here" because the students
and faculty members "have done
something that is important in 1977"
just by organizing and voicing their
opinions.
The rally ended at about 12:45 p.m.
More than 400 people gathered in
the Old Union courtyard yesterday at
noon to participate in "a day of reflec
tion" on the past week's events. Later
in the afternoon. President Richard
Lyman said many of t he trustees resent
what they consider to be "blatant at
tempts to misrepresent their position."
The protesters have portrayed the
Hoard of Trustees' position "as one
that is tolerant of apartheid and of ra
cism, and one that is motivated by cor
porate greed," said Lyman at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
"As one of the younger members put
it on Tuesday, 'We are being handed a
bump rap,' " Lyman added.
"The issue," said Lyman, "is not one
of principle but of tactics: what path of
action relating to the proxy vote is
most likely to have a constructive ef
fect, given the objective of moving
away from apartheid and towards ra
cial justice in South Africa?"
Coleman criticized
Chris Coleman, an organizer of the
Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP), "showed
so little interest in anything other than
the decision not to change the absten
tion on the Ford proxy as to lead both
Mr. Rosenzweig (vice president for
public affairs) . . . and me to ask him
whether the other three demands had
ever had any real meaning," said Ly
man.
After speaking of the reasons
prompting the University's decision to
have the protesters arrested Monday
night, Lyman said, "There was not
even any discussion between the de

monstrators and the University's rep
resentatives of allowing the protesters
to remain in unmolested occupancy oi
the building all night.
"The protesters themselves clearly
wanted to be arrested, as the best
means available to them to de
monstrate the strength of their convic
tions."
Lyman also announced that 270 of
the 294 protesters arrested in Mon
day's sit-in at the Old Union were stu
dents here.
Lyman quoted Coleman as telling
him over the phone Monday night.
"I've got 400 people here who came to
be arrested."
Coleman was out of town yesterday
evening and unavailable for comment.
COP statement
In a statement released to the Daily
last night, the ASSIJ Council of Presi
dents said, "Certain aspects of his
(Lyman's) presentation were insults to
all of us who, because of our moral
convictions participated in the recent
protests to end Stanford's complicity
in South Africa's racist and exploita
tive labor control system."
SCRIP's organization and handling
of the rally "was an exemplary case of
democratic civil disobedience," the
statement declared. "Furthermore, the
rally served not only to educate the
public, hut also as a focal point for
current concern for racism and apar
theid in South Africa."
In Detroit yesterday, the Lord Motor
Co. stockholder resolution calling for
the company's withdrawal from South
Africa met an overwhelming defeat.
Approximately 112 million votes, or

9H.19 per cent of those cast yesterday
were voted against the resolution.
About two million votes were re
corded in favor of the withdrawal.
Profits
Ford announced profits of $98;i
million for 1976. This figure marks an
over 300 per cent increase of the re
corded profits for 1975. The com
pany's total world sales for the year
were about $29 billion, according to

Peter Young of Ford's public relations
department.

opinions.
The rally ended at about 12:45 p.m.
More than 400 people gathered in
the Old Union courtyard yesterday at
noon to participate in "a day of reflec
tion" on the past week's events. Later
in the afternoon. President Richard
Lyman said many of t he trustees resent
what they consider to be "blatant at
tempts to misrepresent their position."
The protesters have portrayed the
Hoard of Trustees' position "as one
that is tolerant of apartheid and of ra
cism, and one that is motivated by cor
porate greed," said Lyman at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
"As one of the younger members put
it on Tuesday, 'We are being handed a
bump rap,' " Lyman added.
"The issue," said Lyman, "is not one
of principle but of tactics: what path of
action relating to the proxy vote is
most likely to have a constructive ef
fect, given the objective of moving
away from apartheid and towards ra
cial justice in South Africa?"
Coleman criticized
Chris Coleman, an organizer of the
Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP), "showed
so little interest in anything other than
the decision not to change the absten
tion on the Ford proxy as to lead both
Mr. Rosenzweig (vice president for
public affairs) . . . and me to ask him
whether the other three demands had
ever had any real meaning," said Ly
man.
After speaking of the reasons
prompting the University's decision to
have the protesters arrested Monday
night, Lyman said, "There was not
even any discussion between the de

monstrators and the University's rep
resentatives of allowing the protesters
to remain in unmolested occupancy oi
the building all night.
"The protesters themselves clearly
wanted to be arrested, as the best
means available to them to de
monstrate the strength of their convic
tions."
Lyman also announced that 270 of
the 294 protesters arrested in Mon
day's sit-in at the Old Union were stu
dents here.
Lyman quoted Coleman as telling
him over the phone Monday night.
"I've got 400 people here who came to
be arrested."
Coleman was out of town yesterday
evening and unavailable for comment.
COP statement
In a statement released to the Daily
last night, the ASSIJ Council of Presi
dents said, "Certain aspects of his
(Lyman's) presentation were insults to
all of us who, because of our moral
convictions participated in the recent
protests to end Stanford's complicity
in South Africa's racist and exploita
tive labor control system."
SCRIP's organization and handling
of the rally "was an exemplary case of
democratic civil disobedience," the
statement declared. "Furthermore, the
rally served not only to educate the
public, hut also as a focal point for
current concern for racism and apar
theid in South Africa."
In Detroit yesterday, the Lord Motor
Co. stockholder resolution calling for
the company's withdrawal from South
Africa met an overwhelming defeat.
Approximately 112 million votes, or

9H.19 per cent of those cast yesterday
were voted against the resolution.
About two million votes were re
corded in favor of the withdrawal.
Profits
Ford announced profits of $98;i
million for 1976. This figure marks an
over 300 per cent increase of the re
corded profits for 1975. The com
pany's total world sales for the year
were about $29 billion, according to

Peter Young of Ford's public relations
department.
At the rally here, protester Andrew
Goldenkranz read SCRIP'S reply to the
board's statement, published in Wed

Old Union, where 294 persons protesting the University's position on South
African investments were arrested Monday night, became the site of yet
another demonstration yesterday as protesters gathered to reflect on the
week's events. Meanwhile, President Richard Lyman said the administra

University's abstention on a Ford Motor Co. stockholder resolution relating
to South Africa.
after every other channel had been
exhausted. It was forced communica
tion in a time of no communication."
The statement*also said, "We got
through; on the other hand we should
not need to sit-in every time that we
feel the need to communicate. We be
lieve that progress has been made . . .
and hope that with mutual good will
and confidence a new and more un
derstanding relationship can de
velop."
Banner unfurled
The rally opened with the unfurling
of a banner from the third floor of the
Old Union acknowledging the support
of UC-Berkeley students for the anti
apartheid movement here.
Statements of support from Cesar
Chavez, the Santa Clara Ghicano Stu
dents, the Associated Students of San
Jose State University, and the Chicano
Affairs Office at Santa Clara were read
to the group.
French Prof. Raymond Ciraud told
the crowd a faculty support committee
for protesters had been in existence
since last weekend. Ciraud said the
committee will issue a support state
ment this weekend.
Ciraud then urged students to help
gather more faculty signatures sup
porting the protesters.
"Abstention is the sort of vote which
is a failure to take a stand," said
Ciraud. "A yes vote is the only vote
that could be consistent with our

group's principles."
Speaking "for all of the people who
have worked so hard to bring us to the
point we are at today," Carol Olney
said, "our energy is flowing; it can't be
shut off."
Olney continued, "But we should
also mourn. In essence, the trustees
voted . . . for the perpetuation of a ra
cist and murderous apartheid gov
ernment. Today, moral investment
policy saw its death, as did freedom,
justiceand human life in South Africa.
"We stand as one and celebrate not
only our current unity, but also our
growing strength. Our hope is now to
educate and activate the whole Stan
ford community."
The crowd also heard a statement of
support from Tim Smith, a member of
the Interfaith Center on Corporate Re
sponsibility. Smith's statement was
recorded in a telephone interview
from Detroit where he read a statement
at the Ford shareholder meeting yes
terday denouncing the University's
abstention on the withdrawal resolu
tion.
Actions taken by protesters at Stan
ford are extremely important, said
Smith. The actions not only express
community concern, he said, they also
are "a very clear message to the South
African government that a significant
number of Americans care about ra
cism there."
Whether the University votes one
way or the other, he said, "is not the

only issue here" because the students
and faculty members "have done
something that is important in 1977"
just by organizing and voicing their
opinions.
