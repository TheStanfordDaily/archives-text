House vetoes U.S. trade with Cuba
Washington — Counteracting Senate committee action,
the House voted yesterday to prohibit U.S. trade with or aid
to Cuba.
The House voted 288-119 to prohibit aid or trade with
either Cuba or Vietnam.
The position was urged by Rep. John Ashbrook (R-Ohio),
who said the House should specifically take a stand on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote Tuesday to lift
part of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.
The Senate Committee voted 10-7 to approve a proposal

by Sen. Ceorge McCovern (D-S.D.), to permit Cuba to buy
American medicines, food, and agricultural supplies hut
not to permit any U.S. purchases of Cuban sugar or other
goods.
The House action was taken on a $1.7 billion authoriza
tion for U.S. economic aid around the world during the
fiscal year starting next Oct. 1.
After adding the amendment barringtrade with Cuba and
Vietnam, the House approved the bill, 252 to 158, and sent it
to the Senate.
Abplanalp reveals new spray device
New York — Robert Abplanalp, the inventor of the valve
on which modern aerosol spray dispensers are based, un
veiled a new spray system yesterday he said makes
fluorocarbon propel lants obsolete.
His announcement at a hastily arranged news conference
came a day after the federal government declared fluorocar
bon propel lants an environmental hazard and proposed a
phased end to their use in aerosol dispensers.
Abplanalp said his new system employs natural gas —
butane and propane, for example — in liquid form as the
propellant and water as the solvent.
It is cheaper, will put more product in a can and answer
all environmental objections to the current aerosols, he
said.
The ratio of product to propellant, by weight, can range
anywhere from 6-to-l up to 30-to-l, depending on the na
ture of the product, he said. By contrast, a can of hairspray
now maybe 50 or 60 percent propellant by weight, he said.
Today's weather
Fair and mostly sunny through tomorrow. Warmer. Lows
in the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the 60s. Variable winds
to 15 mph.
