# 'Sheer madness'
## Nixon refused U.S. Mideast force 
### 
Washington (AP) — Richard Nixon
says he rejected as "sheer madness" a
Soviet proposal that he send two
American divisions into Israel during
the 1973 war to help impose a cease
fire while Russian troops were moved
into Egypt and Syria.
The former president, ranging over
5V2 years of foreign policy in an inter
view broadcast last night, said joint
superpower intervention might have
kept the Mideast peace but it would
have raised "the possibility of a big
power conflict."
In the interview with David Frost,
second in a five-part series of remem
brances. Nixon took credit for preserv
ing Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
from "a coup or worse" by persuading
Israel to release its hold on an encir
cled Egyptian army.
'God-father'
Recalling the implicit pressures he
brought to bear on the Israeli govern
ment. Nixon said that like the storied
Mafia "Godfather," he "gave them an
offer that they could not refuse" — a
promise of unflagging U.S. support
whenever Israel came under attack.
Israel subsequently relented and the
st.iyr was set for negotiated interim

settlements with Egypt and Syria.
President jimmy Carter told repor
ters yesterday he had seen only "a
smali part" of the first interview and
did not intend to watch the second. "It
didn't change my opinion of President
Nixon." he said. "I personally think he
did violate the law and did commit
impeachable offenses."
'Mistaken'
Carteradded: "Most of the peopledo
agree with what I have just said. I think
he's mistaken."
Without having to deal with the ten
sions of Watergate, which forced him
to resign in 1974, Nixon sketched with
considerable detail his impressions of
Henrv Kissinger, his principal foreign
policy adviser, Chairman Mao Tse
tung of China and Soviet leaders
Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid
Brezhnev.
Nixon said Kissinger "couldn't
stand the bureaucratic infighting" and
that Kissinger feuded with William
Rogers, who he finally succeeded as
secretary of state in 1973.
All that flies
Kissinger advised Nixon it might be
politically dangerous to send more
than limited military support to Israel

during the 1973 war but Nixon gave
theorder: "Send everythingthatflies."
Mao Tse-tung, despite complica
tions of at least a partial stroke and
having to converse almost entirely in
monosyllables, "was in charge of him
self and he was in charge of China"
until his death in 1976.
Khrushchev, the late Soviet leader
who steered his country away from the
harsh regime of Josef Stalin, was both
boorish and brilliant, with "a terrible
inferiority complex."
Brezhnev safer
By contrast, Brezhnev, his successor
and current head of the Kremlin
hierarchy, is not so quick but is "far
better mannered" and "a much safer
man to have sitting there with his
finger on the nuclear bomb." Some
what of a "fashion-plate," Nixon said
Brezhnev likes beautiful cars and
beautiful women.
The move to seek an accommoda
tion with China after nearly a quarter
century of hostility was his own,
Nixon said, and not Kissinger's.
"I conceived it before 1 ever met him
and I pushed it very hard from the first
days of the administration," the former
president said.
