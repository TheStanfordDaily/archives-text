The University's overseas campus in
Berlin will remain open forat least two
more years, according to Overseas
Studies Director Mark Mancall.
He said his office recently received
word that the city of Berlin would
allow rent for the villa housing the
University's Berlin campus to be paid
on a sliding scale year by year. This
will make it possible to continue the
program for as many years as the Uni
versity obtains funding, said Mancall.
"Apparently the Berlin people
realized the fmportance of our pre
sence there," Mancall said.
Originally, plans had been made to
close the Berlin campus after this quar
ter. The city had proposed a five-year
lease for the villa in January. "We
couldn't agree to this proposal because
we didn't have the guaranteed funding
necessary," said Mancall.
Raising funds
Under the sliding scale proposal,
about $80,000 must be raised for each
additional year that the campus is to
remain open, according to Mancall.
The University will supply one-time
funds for the next two years, he said,
guaranteeing continuation of the prog
ram through spring 1979.
After this date, said Mancall, funds
from outside sources will be required
to operate the campus. History Prof.
Gordon Graig, German Dept. Ghairman
Walter Lohnes and Assoc. History
Prof. Paul Robinson have volunteered
their efforts to raise funds both in the
United States and in Germany, Man
call said.

He said the ('enter for Research in
International Studies will help with
the fundraising, under the direction of
the General Secretary's Office. Profes
sors and students, especially those
who have studied in Berlin, will also
be called upon to help, according to
Mancall.
A core of fundraising specialists will
work with the fundraising team from
the University, he said.
Outside interest
According to Mancall, "considera
ble interest in the program was shown
even outside the University. Many in
dividuals tried to give us persuasive
arguments urging continuation of the
Berlin program."
The State Department and the
American ambassador in West Ger
many supported keeping the Berlin
campus open, said Mancall, while a
banker in Boston, hearing of the possi
ble closure, wanted to help.
"Apparently, Berlin has a special
function in the minds of many people
here and in Germany," Mancall said.
Several changes may be made in the
program itself, he said. Some students
will now be required to live in the
villa, he said, rather than living with
families, in boarding houses or dor
mitories for German students in the
city of Berlin, as they have done in the
past. This will enable some savings,
according to Mancall.
Germans in villa
"We will now try, though, to get
German students to stay in our villa
and we'll send some of our own into
the Berlin community in order to de
velop some type of German-American
community," Mancall said.
In previous years, students with two
quarters of German here and one quar
ter's experience abroad were able to
take classes at both the free and techni
cal universities in Berlin. In fact, 50
percent of courses were taken in one of
these places. Mancall said he expects
that this will continue in the future.
Final negotiations, based on present
unofficial agreements, will be con
firmed this fall.
A meeting for students and faculty
members interested in planning the
fundraising drives will be held Mon
day in the main lounge at Florence
Moore Hall.
