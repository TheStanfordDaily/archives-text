# SP asks end to commuter trips
## 
### Sue Rice 
Southern Pacific will end its pensinula commuter run
it the railroad's proposal to discontinue service is ap
proved by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
The proposal, made last week, stems from the PlJC's
inaction on a railroad request tor a 96 per cent rate
increase submitted on Aug. 23, 1974, according to Alan
DeMoss, vice president of Southern Pacific (SP).
The railroad is losing $10 milliona year because of the
passenger service, said DeMoss. He noted that SP's
operating costs have increased 58 per cent in the past
four years while the number of passengers have de
creased by 2000.
The railroad's latest request was opposed by Santa
Clara government officials.
According to Santa Clara County Supervisor Rod Diri
don, the railroad has been trying to dump the service for
years because it is more profitable to run only freight
trains.
'Excuse'
"The rate hike is being used as an excuse. If the rates go
up as high as SP would like, rides would completely
stop," he asserted.
DeMoss disagreed, maintaining that SP simply wants
to break even on its passenger service.
"If people want to ride the train, they must pay for
what it costs to operate . . . we're trying to break even,"
said DeMoss,
In the long run, the $10 million a year losses will have
a bad impact on interstate commerce because SP must set
rates to compensate, he added.
"Someone in other western areas pays for people on

the peninsula to have a free ride. It is especially ironic
when San Mateo County has the second highest per
capita earnings in the state," said DeMoss.
It has been two years and nine months since Sl' re
quested the rate increase and DeMoss said he thinks the
commission is "playing politics with the decision on
rate increase."
Reviews
There were questions on the validity of SP's financial
cost statement and reviews hv both state auditors and
Price-Waterhouse took years to complete, according to
DeMoss.
After the studies were made, a proposal was made to
the PUC for an initial 40 per cent increase and a 30 per
cent increase later, according to PUC records. The issue
is at a standstill because the vote is 2-2 and the commis
sion lacks one member.
Other proposals for commuter options recently have
been completed by the Peninsula Transit Alternatives
Study, a program conducted by the Metropolitan Trans
portation Commission (MTC) and conceived by the state
legislature.
The best proposal provides for express bus routes and
improved rail service, according to Sy Moulber of MTC.
One step in the proposal would be for Santa Clara, San
Mateo and San Francisco counties to purchase tickets at
a bulk rate and sell them to commuters at discount
prices, said Moulber.
Another step, he said, would be for the California
Department of Transportation to contract the serviceand
give SP a flat rate. SP does not like this latter course of
action, according to DeMoss.

company claims it is losing $10 million a year on the

Santa Clara County officials have criticized the re
quest, saying the railroad prefers freight to pas
senger service and is using figures on declining pat
ronage as a ruse.

"Someone in other western areas pays for people on

the peninsula to have a free ride. It is especially ironic
when San Mateo County has the second highest per
capita earnings in the state," said DeMoss.
It has been two years and nine months since Sl' re
quested the rate increase and DeMoss said he thinks the
commission is "playing politics with the decision on
rate increase."
Reviews
There were questions on the validity of SP's financial
cost statement and reviews hv both state auditors and
Price-Waterhouse took years to complete, according to
DeMoss.
After the studies were made, a proposal was made to
the PUC for an initial 40 per cent increase and a 30 per
cent increase later, according to PUC records. The issue
is at a standstill because the vote is 2-2 and the commis
sion lacks one member.
Other proposals for commuter options recently have
been completed by the Peninsula Transit Alternatives
Study, a program conducted by the Metropolitan Trans
portation Commission (MTC) and conceived by the state
legislature.
The best proposal provides for express bus routes and
improved rail service, according to Sy Moulber of MTC.
One step in the proposal would be for Santa Clara, San
Mateo and San Francisco counties to purchase tickets at
a bulk rate and sell them to commuters at discount
prices, said Moulber.
Another step, he said, would be for the California
Department of Transportation to contract the serviceand
give SP a flat rate. SP does not like this latter course of
action, according to DeMoss.

line running between San Francisco and San Jose.
Santa Clara County officials have criticized the re
quest, saying the railroad prefers freight to pas
senger service and is using figures on declining pat
ronage as a ruse.
Southern Pacific will end its pensinula commuter run
it the railroad's proposal to discontinue service is ap
proved by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
The proposal, made last week, stems from the PlJC's
inaction on a railroad request tor a 96 per cent rate
increase submitted on Aug. 23, 1974, according to Alan
DeMoss, vice president of Southern Pacific (SP).
The railroad is losing $10 milliona year because of the
passenger service, said DeMoss. He noted that SP's
operating costs have increased 58 per cent in the past
four years while the number of passengers have de
creased by 2000.
The railroad's latest request was opposed by Santa
Clara government officials.
According to Santa Clara County Supervisor Rod Diri
don, the railroad has been trying to dump the service for
years because it is more profitable to run only freight
trains.
'Excuse'
"The rate hike is being used as an excuse. If the rates go
up as high as SP would like, rides would completely
stop," he asserted.
DeMoss disagreed, maintaining that SP simply wants
to break even on its passenger service.
"If people want to ride the train, they must pay for
what it costs to operate . . . we're trying to break even,"
said DeMoss,
In the long run, the $10 million a year losses will have
a bad impact on interstate commerce because SP must set
rates to compensate, he added.
