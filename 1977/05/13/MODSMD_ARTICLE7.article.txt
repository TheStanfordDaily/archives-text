## Frustrated fantasy The 						dorm party 
### 
Nathan and Mel walked into the dorm lounge to
behold "the dorm party" unfold before them with
ritualistic predictability. The band, suitably
named "the Crusaders," blared away from a small
stage in the corner. Beside the left speaker column,
several electrical engineering majors stood mes
merized, awed by the electrical wizardry and mus
ical intricacies. Darkened forms writhed and strut
ted to the music. Not all were graceful. Several
guys flailed and jerked to the music with spas
modic, jutting thrusts.
Across the room from the band, a group huddled
around a silver beer keg, squirting beer from the
black nozzle into plastic cups. Most of them were
surplus males, waiting for the song to finish so
they could take their shift with one of the few girls
on the dance floor.
"Well, Nathan are you going to dance tonight?"
asked Mel. Mel's real name was Owen, but
everyone called him Mellow (shortened quickly to
Mel) because he rarely spoke, moved with ponder
ous, drugged movements and always drank beer.
"Mel, the night is young, yet already the dance
has fallen into the 'college party' rut," replied
Nathan, Mel's good friend.
"Another night of forced eunuchness?"
"Yup," Nathan said. "This university enforces
chastity with sinister efficiency with the limited
number of females here. One could try for one of
the limited supply, but 1 sometimes think girls are
more trouble than they're worth. But other times,
there is nothing I want more than a girl."
Nathan looked around the room and then
pointed to a slim blonde in the corner.
"Now take Beth Thompson over there for an
example. By far, the best-looking girl on campus.
Long, luxurious blonde hair. Dark brown eyes and
a laughing, sparkling mouth. And she's nice too.
She's not stuckup and she's no airhead either. She
has only one problem. Every other guy on campus
thinks the same way about her. She was rush hos
tess for the Zappa Delts, she has a million guys
chasing her and now she's going out with that
brute from the football team...."
"Derek Hamhocks?"
"Yeah, Derek Hamhocks. What kind of chance
do 1 have with someone like her?"
"She's not with Derek tonight. Why don't you go
ask her to dance," offered Mel, sipping his
Michelob.
"But what if she says no or laughs or calls up
Derek to beat me up?"
Just then, Byron, a fat physics major wearing
black plastic glasses and a white shirt, asked Beth
to dance. They walked out onto the dance floor.
Mel and Nathan turned and looked at each other in
disbelief.
"Mel, if she'll dance with that nerd Byron, she'll
dance with me. How should I handle this?" asked
Nathan.
"Just be yourself," Mel said. "A girl likes a guy
she can lean on, one who's sure of himself. And the
only one you can be sure of is yourself. Go to it,
man."
Nathan rushed off in Beth's direction. But the
closer he came, the smaller his steps got.
"What am I doing? She can see from a mileaway

that I'm coming over to ask her to dance. Maybe 1
can walk past her and pretend I'm going for a beer,
except the beer keg is on the other side of the room.
Now come on, Nathan, maintain, maintain...."
Beth looked up and smiled as Nathan came over.
"Hi Nathan, how are you," she said, barely audible
over the musical din.
"Uh, er, would you like to, um, dance, Beth?"
Nathan sputtered.
"Sure," Beth said. They walked out to mid
dance floor as the band rocked into its next song.
"Boy, is she graceful," Nathan thought to him
self. "I bet I look like a clod out here. Look at Mel
over there. I bet he's smirking at me under that
blank expression of his. Everyone else is probably
staring and snickering, too."
The song ended. "That wasn't so bad," Nathan
thought.
"Thanks a lot for the dance, Nathan. It's getting
late. I think I'm going to bed now. Would you like
to walk me up to my room?" Beth asked.
"(Gulp), Sure. Uh, let me get my beer first."
Nathan sprinted over for his beer, and Mel.
"Mel, Mel, you'll never believe this. She wants
me to walk her up to her room."
"Nathan, you won't believe this either. I just
talked to one of Derek Hamhock's best friends from
the frat. Beth gave Derek the shaft three nights
ago." Mel crunched on a fat Dutch pretzel to em
phasize his point.
"Maybe I should try to ask her out."
"Go for it. She wouldn't have asked you up to her
boudoir if she didn't want to 'continue the rela
tionship.' Make the most of this opportunity and
leave everything to instinct," Mel said.
Nathan left and rushed over to Beth. They
started upstairs. When they reached her room,
Beth cracked the door open and looked in.
"My roommate's asleep. Maybe we can talk in the
hall," Beth said.
Panic seized Nathan. He was not ready to ask her
out yet, so he tried to delay that moment of truth.
"So how are your African violets doing?" asked
Nathan.
This bought some time. Beth began a long
winded description of her plants and their suscep
tibility to root fungus, fleas and measles. As she
droned on, Nathan sorted through all the pos
sibilities available for a date next week.
Beth stopped talking. An awkward silence. She
began playing with the notepad on her door.
"She's stalling," he thought. "I'd better ask her
now."
Beth looked up at Nathan. "I think I'm going tp
bed now. Good night." She turned the doorknob,
opened the door and took one step in. Nathan
blurted,
"Say, how would you like to go to a movie with
me next Friday night?"
Beth turned her head and stared straight into
Nathan's eyes. The silence was killing.
"That would be nice Nathan. When will you
come by?"
He didn't remember what was said after that, but
then, it really didn't matter.
