# Israel violates human rights

The western governments are
very concerned these days about
the violation of human rights.
The topic of human rights is co
vered in every news publication
and media broadcast. Ironically,
these governments never tried to
understand the problem of the
homeless Palestinian people
whose basic human rights have
been violated for 29 years.
In 1917 the Jewish com
munities in Palestine consti
tuted eight per cent of the total
population and owned less than
2.5 per cent of the land. During
30 years of British occupation,
Jewish Agency (the land pur
chasing organization in Pales
tine) land holdings reached six
per cent of the total, and immig
ration raised the percentage of
Jews to 1/3 the total Palestinian
population of nearly two mil lion
in 1947.
The United Nations Partition
Plan of November 1947 awarded
the "Jewish State" 56 per cent of
the total land area of Palestine.
The Jewish Agency sought to
expand over the area allotted to
them by the Plan. In the ensuing
conflict, Israeli armed forces (the
Haganah, the Stern Gang, and
the Irgun Xvai Leumi) occupied
about 78 per cent of Palestine,
most of it before British evacua
tion on May 15, 1948, and before
the entry into Palestine of a
single soldier from neighboring
Arab states. More tragic was the
expulsion and terrorization of
nearly 3/4 million Palestinians
from their lands and country.
Since 1948, the right of return
for the displaced Palestinians
has been denied, and the rights
of the Palestinians in the oc
cupied territories have been vio
lated. The violation of human
rights in the occupied territories
includes the destruction of
Palestinian Arab villages and
houses, expulsion of Palesti
nians and confiscation of lands,
torture of Palestinian political
prisoners, and the discrimina
tion between Palestinian Arabs

and Oriental lews on one side
versus Western Jews on the other
side.
Professor Israel Shahak (pre
vious president of the Israeli
League for Human and Civil
Rights) published a report on the
Arab villages destroyed in Israel.
In the period from 1948 to 1973,
385 villages, about 80 per cent of
the total Arab villages, were
completely destroyed by Israel.
Shahak says: "This, of course,
is done on purpose in order that
the accepted myth of 'an empty
country' can be taught and ac
cepted in Israeli schools and told
to visitors."
In Israel, they are never refer
red to. For this is what hap
pened: a largely non-native col
lection of people simply effaced
385 villages in order to establish
a "new" state. This was not a
land without people. Rather it
was a land, Palestine, with
people, transformed intoa desert
so that a "new" land could blos
som.
The pattern of destruction was
chillingly radical. An Arab vil
lage would be invaded; then
every house, every garden wall,
every cemetery and its tomb
stones would be razed, literally
to the ground.
; A house is a basic need for
every human being. Since the
1967 war, more than 19,000
houses in the occupied ter
ritories have been destroyed or
razed after the expulsion of their
inhabitants.
Another measure consists of
the appropriation of property,
whether private or public, in
order to "Judaize" all the ter
ritories, and this is done in ac
cordance with laws that were in
use during the British mandate.
The law helps the designs of
the occupation authorities espe
cially in Jerusalem and its out
skirts. To replace the destroyed
houses, large buildings are being
erected to house Jewish families
whilethe Arabs are compelled to
find refuge in villages far from
their place of work and very dif-

ferent from those they were born
in.
Expulsion and confiscation
About 75 Jewish settlements
have been established in the oc
cupied Arab territories since
1967. The Zionists establish
these settlements in what they
foresee as the border areas of
their future state, and as a shield
against the counter-action they
expect from those they displace.
Most of these settlements, in vio
lation of international U.N. re
solutions, are established on ex
propriated Arab land. Here are a
few examples.
Israel had a plan of establish
ing the new city of Yamit, bet
ween El Arish and the Gaza Strip
on the Sinai Peninsula, with a
quarter of a million inhabitants,
which would make it the third
largest city in "Greater Israel" (it
was of course to be sited outside
Israel, on Egyptian territory).
The process began as long ago
as 1969, when an area of 3000
acres was expropriated. In 1972,
further confiscations took place
with a total disregard, not only
for the rights of the inhabitants,
but also for the most elementary
considerations of humanity.
According to Dr. kapliouk,
an Israeli journalist, in Le
Monde, May 15,1975, the Israeli
soldiers "drove off some 10,000
farmers and bedouin, bulldozed
or dynamited their houses, pul
led down their tents, destroyed
their crops and filled in their
wells."
Additionally, Kapliouk stated
that on Oct. 8. 1973 when
everyone's attention was di
verted by the crossing of the
Suez Canal and the fighting on
the Golan front, Israeli soldiers
seized Sheikh Hassan Ali al
Sawarqeh and expelled him,
with a thousand of his tribes
men, to El Arish, after which
they confiscated and fenced off
7500 acres of good agricultural
land.
