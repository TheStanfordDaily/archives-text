# Stanford Shopping Center addition begins
## 
### 
Construction has started on a $6.5
million expansion of the Stanford
Shopping Center which will house
many small stores.
Two buildings are being erected on
what was the parking lot on the west
side of t he present Macy's store. When
completed, these buildings will bring
the total number of stores in the center
to about 110 while increasing building
space by nearly 20 per cent.
"This will provide a much wider
variety of restaurants, apparel stores.

gift, consumer services and specialty
shops," according to James Nelson, di
rector of facilities and property here.
I'robable tenants include two major
restaurants, a home furnishings store,
a sporting goods store as well as shoe
and apparel stores.
Romanesque arches common at
Stanford will be maintained but stores
will be encouraged to create indi
vidual designs, according to John Mull,
one of the architects working on the
project.
"By avoiding any fixed formulas in

storefront design, we believe shoppers
will see a lot more originality and last
ing vitality," he said.
The shopping center will remain
unenclosed rather than follow the
trend of most new centers toward en
closure and air conditioning. Energy
savings now average 10 to 20 per cent
of the merchants' space rental costs,
Nelson said.
According to Field, the center will
have 150 parking spaces for bicycles,
six times what now exists. "We may be
the only shopping center in the coun
try with covered parking for hikes " he
said.
In addition, the center will includea
transfer point for public transportation
including the Marguerite shuttle to the
center of campus. Nelson said the
shuttle brings 200 to 400 people a day
to the center and the number should
rise when new restaurants open.
A plaza will be built between the
new buildings and Macy's and will
feature a still water pool with a
sculpture combining a mermaid and a
frog. A 50-foot high bell tower with a
large clock will also be placed in the
piaza.
Construction on the current phase of
the shopping center expansion is
scheduled to be completed in early
1978. Construction on a third building
between Macy's and the Emporium
will begin early next year and will cost
about $1.5 million.
The major impetus for the current
renovation and expansion projects
came with expiration of the original
20-year leases issued when the center
was first built.
Future plans call for a new theater

on the corner of Arboretum and Quarry
Roads as well as a fashion specialty
house adjacent to the two buildings
now being constructed.
Nelson said he hopes the present
total of four restaurants will be ex
panded to 10 or 12 with theaddition to
the center.
