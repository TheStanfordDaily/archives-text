# Weather, demand affect coffee price

London (AI J ) — International
experts sa\ two factors will de
termine the future cost of a cup
of coffee: the weather in south
ern Brazil this July and the rate at
which world coffee reserves con
tinue to dwindle.
If a bad frost hits Brazil — like
the one in 1975 that almost
wiped out the country's coffee
growing potential the coffee
trade is in for one of its worst
( rises ever.
The experts watching the cof
fee business are apprehensive
because since 1975 the world
trade has been living on
stockpiles accumulated in the
vears of plenty before the Brazi
lian frost.
By IDec. 1. these specialists
predict, world stocks will be
down to fewer than three mill

ion, 132-pound bags of green un
roasted coffee. That is only about
five per cent of the amount of
coffee traded in a year.
Where these three million
bags are, no one knows for sure.
But one thing does seem certain:
Brazil will have none left by
year's end.
In the past, stocks in producer
country warehouses, amounting
to at least a year's supply, took
care of partial crop failures.
In the past two years, however,
besides the frost in Brazil, other
factors cutting into the coffee
supply were civil strife in Africa,
disrupting Angolan, Ugandan
and Ethiopian production, and a
drought in Colombia that this
year lopped off 500.000 bags
from the expected crop.
