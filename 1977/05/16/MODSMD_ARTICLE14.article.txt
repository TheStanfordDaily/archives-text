# Trojans unload on Card netters

### Richard Keller 
USC proved to be a tougher
opponent than the C.olden Cat
ers last night at Maples Pavilion.
In a World Team Tennis (WTT)
format, the Trojans beat Stan
ford, 32-24.
This is the second year Stan
ford has hosted such an event.
Each contest consists of one set
each of men's and women's sing
les and doubles and mixed dou
bles. Scoring is dune by adding
up every game.
Pac-8 singles champ Bill Maze
and partner John Rast paired up
in the opening act of the evening
in a losing effort against Mike
Newberry and Andy I.ucchesi of
IJSC. Maze and Rast won, 7-5.
"We've played twice and
never beaten them," Maze said.
"It's kind of a psych-out thing.
But one set doesn't mean any
thing. It doesn't count for any
ranking."
Next up was the women's
singles between Stanford's Susie
Hagey and USC's Sheila
Mclnerney. Hagey was down
0-5, brought the score back to
2-5, and then lost the next game
with a netted bat khand.
In fairness to Hagey. she didn't
play anywhere near her poten
tial last night. She was ranked
No. 10 in the world in the 18s
and could have blown Mclner
ney right off the court and all the
way back to L.A. if she had been
on.
"I was anticipating playing
Hallquist," said Hagey. She had
defeated the No. 1 Trojan twice
this season. "I didn't find out
until I was on the court that I had
to play Mclnerney. She has a
completely different style.
"I was reading all day study
ing for a test, and it threw my
depth perception off. All my
misses were long, and I became
tentative. It's just not smart to
read right before a match."
Trojan's Diane Desfor and
(Iretchen Gait got by Barb Jordan
and Pat Varga, 6-3. The match
was marked by the Cards' inef
fective lobbing game.
Matt Mitchell came on court

next to lose to No. 1 Trojan Bruce
Manson, 6-4. Mitchell, who an
nihilated Manson at Ojai two
weeks ago, 6-2, 6-0, was broken
in the next to last game when he
double faulted a game point.
Mixed doubles turned out to
be the Perry Wright-Chris Lewis
comedy hour. Their antics over
shadowed the great play of their
partners Diane Morrison and
Hallquist.

Both women held their serves
throughout the set, and forced a
tiebreaker which Stanford won
4-1.
With the score 31-21, the con
test moved into a WTT overtime.
According to league rules, if the
team that is behind wins the
final match, play is continued
until the winning team gets one
game or until the team that's be
hind evens the score. Wright and

Morrison didn't get all the
games, but they did win three
before succumbing.
Towards the end of the last
match the USC bench was rally
ing behind Lewis. Not to be out
done, Wright raised his arms to
the sky reminiscent of a Creek
god every time Stanford won a
game. But even a Creek god
couldn't have stopped IJSC.
