# Women down UCLA, lose to USC
## Maze downs Mitchell at Cal 
### Jill Lieber 
Stanford's women netters split
two matches this weekend
against the strong I,os Angeles
schools. The Cards barely beat
UCLA, 5-4 and were defeated by
USC, 6-3.
It's certain that the Cards are
not on the same par as pow
erhouse USC, which according
to head coach Anne Hill, "is de
finitely the No. 1 favorite in the
country."
Sophomore Ail-American
Susie Hagey won all four of her
matches this weekend. She beat
UCLA's Paula Smith, 6-3, 6-4
and Trojan Barb Hallquist, 4-6,
6-4, 6-1. Hagey teammed up with
Diane Morrison to topple Bruins
Smith and kirn Nilsson, 6-4. 7-6
and Trojans Sheila Mclnerney
and Hallquist. 6-3, 6-2.
"Susie had an excellent
weekend," said Hill "She
played very consistently. It
showed as she won all four of her
matches."
The Trojan's No. 2 player,
freshman Mclnerney, beat Diane
Morrison, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
"In some ways this weekend
was encouraging. Against IJCLA
out top three women really
dominated their opponents in
each of their matches. And our
No. 1 doubles team did, too.
These are the people who wil I be
representing us at the Nation
als."
The doubles team of Barb Jor

dan and Pat Varga lost both
matches this weekend. Jordan,
the nation's No. 3 ranked
amateur, and stronger of the
doubles pair, is coming back
after two months with tendinitis
of the shoulder. Still, the
sophomore from King of Prussia,
Pa., crushed UCLA's Nilsson in
singles, 6-1, 6-1, and lost in the
doubles match against Bruins
Becky Bell and Shannon Cor
don, 6-1, 6-4.
Saturday Jordan lost to 'SC's
Diane Desfor, 6-4, 6-2 and also
was downed in doubles, by De
sfor and Cretchen Gait, 6-2, 6-2.
"I'm not trying to make any
excuses," said Hill, "but Barb
and Pat have not really played
together much since February.
And it takes a little time to get
going. Desfor and Gait are a
tough team to beat."
Desfor and Gait are ranked
eighth in women's doubles in
the U.S.
Stanford's men's team was in
Berkeley Friday and Saturday
for the Pac-8 Classic. The Cards
placed first with 12 team points
to USC's 7 and Cal's 3.
Mitchell and Maze both de
feated the top men from USC,
Bruce Manson and Chris Lewis
in the semifinals. And then the
two Cards found themselves on
opposite ends of the court in the
finals match Saturday.
"Willie" Maze beat Mitchell,
2-6, 6-4, 6-2. Coach Dick Gould

said he was not surprised by the
win.

Team scores: Stanford 12, USC 7 Cal 3
Stanford's women netters split
two matches this weekend
against the strong I,os Angeles
schools. The Cards barely beat
UCLA, 5-4 and were defeated by
USC, 6-3.
It's certain that the Cards are
not on the same par as pow
erhouse USC, which according
to head coach Anne Hill, "is de
finitely the No. 1 favorite in the
country."
Sophomore Ail-American
Susie Hagey won all four of her
matches this weekend. She beat
UCLA's Paula Smith, 6-3, 6-4
and Trojan Barb Hallquist, 4-6,
6-4, 6-1. Hagey teammed up with
Diane Morrison to topple Bruins
Smith and kirn Nilsson, 6-4. 7-6
and Trojans Sheila Mclnerney
and Hallquist. 6-3, 6-2.
"Susie had an excellent
weekend," said Hill "She
played very consistently. It
showed as she won all four of her
matches."
The Trojan's No. 2 player,
freshman Mclnerney, beat Diane
Morrison, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
"In some ways this weekend
was encouraging. Against IJCLA
out top three women really
dominated their opponents in
each of their matches. And our
No. 1 doubles team did, too.
These are the people who wil I be
representing us at the Nation
als."
The doubles team of Barb Jor

dan and Pat Varga lost both
matches this weekend. Jordan,
the nation's No. 3 ranked
amateur, and stronger of the
doubles pair, is coming back
after two months with tendinitis
of the shoulder. Still, the
sophomore from King of Prussia,
Pa., crushed UCLA's Nilsson in
singles, 6-1, 6-1, and lost in the
doubles match against Bruins
Becky Bell and Shannon Cor
don, 6-1, 6-4.
Saturday Jordan lost to 'SC's
Diane Desfor, 6-4, 6-2 and also
was downed in doubles, by De
sfor and Cretchen Gait, 6-2, 6-2.
"I'm not trying to make any
excuses," said Hill, "but Barb
and Pat have not really played
together much since February.
And it takes a little time to get
going. Desfor and Gait are a
tough team to beat."
Desfor and Gait are ranked
eighth in women's doubles in
the U.S.
Stanford's men's team was in
Berkeley Friday and Saturday
for the Pac-8 Classic. The Cards
placed first with 12 team points
to USC's 7 and Cal's 3.
Mitchell and Maze both de
feated the top men from USC,
Bruce Manson and Chris Lewis
in the semifinals. And then the
two Cards found themselves on
opposite ends of the court in the
finals match Saturday.
"Willie" Maze beat Mitchell,
2-6, 6-4, 6-2. Coach Dick Gould

said he was not surprised by the
win.

Stanford's women netters split
two matches this weekend
against the strong I,os Angeles
schools. The Cards barely beat
UCLA, 5-4 and were defeated by
USC, 6-3.
It's certain that the Cards are
not on the same par as pow
erhouse USC, which according
to head coach Anne Hill, "is de
finitely the No. 1 favorite in the
country."
Sophomore Ail-American
Susie Hagey won all four of her
matches this weekend. She beat
UCLA's Paula Smith, 6-3, 6-4
and Trojan Barb Hallquist, 4-6,
6-4, 6-1. Hagey teammed up with

each of their matches. And our
No. 1 doubles team did, too.
These are the people who wil I be
representing us at the Nation

matches this weekend. Jordan,
the nation's No. 3 ranked
