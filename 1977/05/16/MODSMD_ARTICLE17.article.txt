# Lofton, Albritton win Pac-8 titles; Sheats, mile relay break records
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Los Angeles— Led by sprinters
Clancy Edwards and Tom An
drews, the USC Trojans over
came a 50-point first-day deficit
to catch Washington State's
"Foreign Legion" and win their
fourth straight Pacific-8 track
and field title Saturday at UC
LA's Drake Stadium.
Edwards breezed to wins in
the 100 and 200. setting a col
legiate record with a 20.13 clock
ing in the latter, and anchored
Southern Cal's victorious 400-
meter relay Andrews copped an
incredibly grueling double,
winning the 400-meter dash and
the 400 intermediate hurdles.
Washington State, relying on
foreign athletes for 87 of its 132
second-place points, did not
have the depth to top the Tro
jan's 146-point total.
Cellar dwellers no more
Stanford finished seventh and
out of the conference cellar for
the first time in five years as
lames Lofton won the long jump,
Terry Albritton topped the shot
put field and Alan Sheats and
Tom Shellworth recorded
lifetime bests on the way to
third-place finishes in the 400
meters and the 400 intermediate
hurdles.
The long jump was touted as a
matchup between*Lofton and
USC's Larry Doubley and UC-
I ,A's Willie Hanks, both of whom
had beaten die Stanford junior
earlier in the season.
Lofton, who injured his ham
string last week in the West
(loast Relays, said he considered
Doubley more of a threat "be
cause Doubley considers himself
more of a threat. Hanks is think
ing about the triple jump."
Lofton opened with a 24-foot
jump and a foul, while Doubley
assumed the meet lead with a

25-10% leap in the second
round. Lofton gained the lead by
a quarter of an inch with a 25-11
mark on his third jump.
Then on his fifth jump, Lofton
hit the pit then bounded out with
his fists clenched and his arms
raised overhead in joy, knowing
that his 26-4 3 /4 jump was good
enough for his first Pac-8 crown.
Despite winning the shot put
by more than three feet with a
toss of 65-6'/2, American record
holder Albritton was less than
overjoyed about his technique in
Friday's competition.
Doesn't have it
"Motion is a funny thing—in
the shot put it lasts less than a
second. Sometimes you have it
and sometimes you don't...right
now 1 don't."
Whereas Albritton continues
to search for his record-setting
form, quarter-miler Sheats has
just found his. The Altadena
junior broke a 45-year-old Stan
ford mark (see accompanying
story) in the 400, finishing third
in 46.08 in Saturday's final.
Sheats recorded the fastest
time in the preliminary heats
Friday with a 46.32 lap.
"I tried to intimidate them in
the preliminaries." Sheats said
Friday. "1 want them to concede
first because they think it's al
ready sewed up."
No concession
Hut Andrews and his brother
Joel were not as psyched out as
the Cardinal sprinter had hoped,
finishing one-two in 45.57 and
45.80.
Shellworth ran "really easy"
in the intermediate hurdle pre
lims, then knocked an entire
second off his lifetime best to
finish third in 51.2 behind two
time Pac-8 champ Andrews and
Trojan Rich Craybehl.
The junior from Atherton

came oft the turn into the home
straightaway in fourth but
caught UCLA's Phil Mills in the
stretch to finish third and earn
an NCAA qualifying mark.
"Mills ran very hard in his
heat yesterday," Shellworth said
after the meet. "He went out real
fast but I knew he was faltering
near the end. 1 almost went blank
over the last hurdle but held on
to beat him."
Another school record
Shellworth came back to team
with Sheats, Lofton and CTordon
Hanks and shatter the school
mile relay mark with a 3:08.5
four-lap time in the 1600-meter
relay (the time converts to a
3:09.6 mile time). The old record
of 3:10.5 stood for 37 years. Lof
ton anchored the foursome with
a 45.4 split.
Two other Stanford athletes
turned in lifetime bests while
scoring points for the Cards.
Senior Steve Crowley broke
down and bought a new pair of
shoes last week to replace the
ones he had competed in since
his junior year in high school.
They apparently made quite a
difference as Crowley ran a
3:45.6 1500 meters, nearly four
seconds faster than his best, and
finished sixth.
Fast pace
Washington State's Joshua
kimeto took the 1500 field out
with a 58-second first lap,
brought the pack around the
800-meter mark in 1:58, crossed
the 1200-meter mark in 2:59,
then faded fast as the field pas
sed the pace-setting Kenyan.
Crowley passed the 1200-
meter mark in 3:00, five seconds
faster than his three-lap best.
"I tried to pop it on the last lap
but 1 didn't have it," Crowley
said. "That was the longest
straightaway I've ever run. I kept
looking up and thinking,
'Where's the tape?"'
DecathleteCarl Johnk finished
fifth in the two-day, 10-event
competition with 6588 points,
269 points better than his previ
ous best.

straightaway in fourth but
caught UCLA's Phil Mills in the
stretch to finish third and earn
an NCAA qualifying mark.
"Mills ran very hard in his
heat yesterday," Shellworth said
after the meet. "He went out real
fast but I knew he was faltering
near the end. 1 almost went blank
over the last hurdle but held on
to beat him."
Another school record
Shellworth came back to team
with Sheats, Lofton and CTordon
Hanks and shatter the school
mile relay mark with a 3:08.5
four-lap time in the 1600-meter
relay (the time converts to a
3:09.6 mile time). The old record
of 3:10.5 stood for 37 years. Lof
ton anchored the foursome with
a 45.4 split.
Two other Stanford athletes
turned in lifetime bests while
scoring points for the Cards.
Senior Steve Crowley broke
down and bought a new pair of
shoes last week to replace the
ones he had competed in since
his junior year in high school.
They apparently made quite a
difference as Crowley ran a
3:45.6 1500 meters, nearly four
seconds faster than his best, and
finished sixth.
Fast pace
Washington State's Joshua
kimeto took the 1500 field out
with a 58-second first lap,
brought the pack around the
800-meter mark in 1:58, crossed
the 1200-meter mark in 2:59,
then faded fast as the field pas
sed the pace-setting Kenyan.
Crowley passed the 1200-
meter mark in 3:00, five seconds
faster than his three-lap best.
"I tried to pop it on the last lap
but 1 didn't have it," Crowley
said. "That was the longest
straightaway I've ever run. I kept
looking up and thinking,
'Where's the tape?"'
DecathleteCarl Johnk finished
fifth in the two-day, 10-event
competition with 6588 points,
269 points better than his previ
ous best.

Los Angeles— Led by sprinters
Clancy Edwards and Tom An
drews, the USC Trojans over
came a 50-point first-day deficit
to catch Washington State's
"Foreign Legion" and win their
fourth straight Pacific-8 track
and field title Saturday at UC
LA's Drake Stadium.
Edwards breezed to wins in
the 100 and 200. setting a col
legiate record with a 20.13 clock
ing in the latter, and anchored
Southern Cal's victorious 400-
meter relay Andrews copped an
incredibly grueling double,
winning the 400-meter dash and
the 400 intermediate hurdles.
Washington State, relying on
foreign athletes for 87 of its 132
second-place points, did not
have the depth to top the Tro
jan's 146-point total.
Cellar dwellers no more
Stanford finished seventh and
out of the conference cellar for
the first time in five years as
lames Lofton won the long jump,
Terry Albritton topped the shot
put field and Alan Sheats and
Tom Shellworth recorded
lifetime bests on the way to
third-place finishes in the 400
meters and the 400 intermediate
hurdles.
The long jump was touted as a
matchup between*Lofton and
USC's Larry Doubley and UC-
I ,A's Willie Hanks, both of whom
had beaten die Stanford junior
earlier in the season.
Lofton, who injured his ham
string last week in the West
(loast Relays, said he considered
Doubley more of a threat "be
cause Doubley considers himself
more of a threat. Hanks is think
ing about the triple jump."
Lofton opened with a 24-foot
jump and a foul, while Doubley
assumed the meet lead with a

25-10% leap in the second
round. Lofton gained the lead by
a quarter of an inch with a 25-11
mark on his third jump.
Then on his fifth jump, Lofton
hit the pit then bounded out with
his fists clenched and his arms
raised overhead in joy, knowing
that his 26-4 3 /4 jump was good
enough for his first Pac-8 crown.
Despite winning the shot put
by more than three feet with a
toss of 65-6'/2, American record
holder Albritton was less than
overjoyed about his technique in
Friday's competition.
Doesn't have it
"Motion is a funny thing—in
the shot put it lasts less than a
second. Sometimes you have it
and sometimes you don't...right
now 1 don't."
Whereas Albritton continues
to search for his record-setting
form, quarter-miler Sheats has
just found his. The Altadena
junior broke a 45-year-old Stan
ford mark (see accompanying
story) in the 400, finishing third
in 46.08 in Saturday's final.
Sheats recorded the fastest
time in the preliminary heats
Friday with a 46.32 lap.
"I tried to intimidate them in
the preliminaries." Sheats said
Friday. "1 want them to concede
first because they think it's al
ready sewed up."
No concession
Hut Andrews and his brother
Joel were not as psyched out as
the Cardinal sprinter had hoped,
finishing one-two in 45.57 and
45.80.
Shellworth ran "really easy"
in the intermediate hurdle pre
lims, then knocked an entire
second off his lifetime best to
finish third in 51.2 behind two
time Pac-8 champ Andrews and
Trojan Rich Craybehl.
The junior from Atherton

came oft the turn into the home
straightaway in fourth but
caught UCLA's Phil Mills in the
stretch to finish third and earn
an NCAA qualifying mark.
"Mills ran very hard in his

Los Angeles— Led by sprinters
Clancy Edwards and Tom An
drews, the USC Trojans over
came a 50-point first-day deficit
to catch Washington State's
"Foreign Legion" and win their
fourth straight Pacific-8 track
and field title Saturday at UC
LA's Drake Stadium.
Edwards breezed to wins in
the 100 and 200. setting a col
legiate record with a 20.13 clock
ing in the latter, and anchored
Southern Cal's victorious 400-
meter relay Andrews copped an
incredibly grueling double,
winning the 400-meter dash and
the 400 intermediate hurdles.
Washington State, relying on
foreign athletes for 87 of its 132
second-place points, did not
have the depth to top the Tro
jan's 146-point total.
Cellar dwellers no more
Stanford finished seventh and
out of the conference cellar for
the first time in five years as
lames Lofton won the long jump,
Terry Albritton topped the shot
put field and Alan Sheats and
Tom Shellworth recorded
lifetime bests on the way to
third-place finishes in the 400
meters and the 400 intermediate
hurdles.
The long jump was touted as a
matchup between*Lofton and
USC's Larry Doubley and UC-
I ,A's Willie Hanks, both of whom
had beaten die Stanford junior
earlier in the season.
Lofton, who injured his ham
string last week in the West
(loast Relays, said he considered
Doubley more of a threat "be
cause Doubley considers himself
more of a threat. Hanks is think
ing about the triple jump."
Lofton opened with a 24-foot
jump and a foul, while Doubley
assumed the meet lead with a

25-10% leap in the second
round. Lofton gained the lead by
a quarter of an inch with a 25-11
mark on his third jump.
Then on his fifth jump, Lofton
hit the pit then bounded out with
his fists clenched and his arms
raised overhead in joy, knowing
that his 26-4 3 /4 jump was good
enough for his first Pac-8 crown.
Despite winning the shot put
by more than three feet with a
toss of 65-6'/2, American record
holder Albritton was less than
overjoyed about his technique in
Friday's competition.
Doesn't have it
"Motion is a funny thing—in
the shot put it lasts less than a
second. Sometimes you have it
and sometimes you don't...right
now 1 don't."
Whereas Albritton continues
to search for his record-setting
form, quarter-miler Sheats has
just found his. The Altadena
junior broke a 45-year-old Stan
ford mark (see accompanying
story) in the 400, finishing third
in 46.08 in Saturday's final.
Sheats recorded the fastest
time in the preliminary heats
Friday with a 46.32 lap.
"I tried to intimidate them in
the preliminaries." Sheats said
Friday. "1 want them to concede
first because they think it's al
ready sewed up."
No concession
Hut Andrews and his brother
Joel were not as psyched out as
the Cardinal sprinter had hoped,
finishing one-two in 45.57 and
45.80.
Shellworth ran "really easy"
in the intermediate hurdle pre
lims, then knocked an entire
second off his lifetime best to
finish third in 51.2 behind two
time Pac-8 champ Andrews and
Trojan Rich Craybehl.
The junior from Atherton

came oft the turn into the home
straightaway in fourth but
caught UCLA's Phil Mills in the
stretch to finish third and earn
an NCAA qualifying mark.
"Mills ran very hard in his
heat yesterday," Shellworth said
after the meet. "He went out real
fast but I knew he was faltering
near the end. 1 almost went blank
over the last hurdle but held on
to beat him."
Another school record
Shellworth came back to team
with Sheats, Lofton and CTordon
Hanks and shatter the school
mile relay mark with a 3:08.5
four-lap time in the 1600-meter
relay (the time converts to a
3:09.6 mile time). The old record
of 3:10.5 stood for 37 years. Lof
ton anchored the foursome with
a 45.4 split.
Two other Stanford athletes
turned in lifetime bests while
scoring points for the Cards.
Senior Steve Crowley broke
down and bought a new pair of
shoes last week to replace the
ones he had competed in since
his junior year in high school.
They apparently made quite a
difference as Crowley ran a
3:45.6 1500 meters, nearly four
seconds faster than his best, and
finished sixth.
Fast pace
Washington State's Joshua
kimeto took the 1500 field out
with a 58-second first lap,
brought the pack around the
800-meter mark in 1:58, crossed
the 1200-meter mark in 2:59,
then faded fast as the field pas
sed the pace-setting Kenyan.
Crowley passed the 1200-
meter mark in 3:00, five seconds
faster than his three-lap best.
"I tried to pop it on the last lap
but 1 didn't have it," Crowley
said. "That was the longest
straightaway I've ever run. I kept
looking up and thinking,
'Where's the tape?"'
DecathleteCarl Johnk finished
fifth in the two-day, 10-event
competition with 6588 points,
269 points better than his previ
ous best.

Los Angeles— Led by sprinters
Clancy Edwards and Tom An
drews, the USC Trojans over
came a 50-point first-day deficit
to catch Washington State's
"Foreign Legion" and win their
fourth straight Pacific-8 track
and field title Saturday at UC
LA's Drake Stadium.
Edwards breezed to wins in
the 100 and 200. setting a col
legiate record with a 20.13 clock
ing in the latter, and anchored
Southern Cal's victorious 400-
meter relay Andrews copped an
incredibly grueling double,
winning the 400-meter dash and
the 400 intermediate hurdles.
Washington State, relying on
foreign athletes for 87 of its 132
second-place points, did not
have the depth to top the Tro
jan's 146-point total.
Cellar dwellers no more
Stanford finished seventh and
out of the conference cellar for
the first time in five years as
lames Lofton won the long jump,
Terry Albritton topped the shot
put field and Alan Sheats and
Tom Shellworth recorded
lifetime bests on the way to
third-place finishes in the 400
meters and the 400 intermediate
hurdles.
The long jump was touted as a
matchup between*Lofton and
USC's Larry Doubley and UC-
I ,A's Willie Hanks, both of whom
had beaten die Stanford junior
earlier in the season.
Lofton, who injured his ham
string last week in the West
(loast Relays, said he considered
Doubley more of a threat "be
cause Doubley considers himself
more of a threat. Hanks is think
ing about the triple jump."
Lofton opened with a 24-foot
jump and a foul, while Doubley
assumed the meet lead with a

25-10% leap in the second
round. Lofton gained the lead by
a quarter of an inch with a 25-11
mark on his third jump.
Then on his fifth jump, Lofton
hit the pit then bounded out with
his fists clenched and his arms
raised overhead in joy, knowing
that his 26-4 3 /4 jump was good
enough for his first Pac-8 crown.
Despite winning the shot put
by more than three feet with a
toss of 65-6'/2, American record
holder Albritton was less than
overjoyed about his technique in
Friday's competition.
Doesn't have it
"Motion is a funny thing—in
the shot put it lasts less than a
second. Sometimes you have it
and sometimes you don't...right
now 1 don't."
Whereas Albritton continues
to search for his record-setting
form, quarter-miler Sheats has
just found his. The Altadena
junior broke a 45-year-old Stan
ford mark (see accompanying
story) in the 400, finishing third
in 46.08 in Saturday's final.
Sheats recorded the fastest
time in the preliminary heats
Friday with a 46.32 lap.
"I tried to intimidate them in
the preliminaries." Sheats said
Friday. "1 want them to concede
first because they think it's al
ready sewed up."
No concession
Hut Andrews and his brother
Joel were not as psyched out as
the Cardinal sprinter had hoped,
finishing one-two in 45.57 and
45.80.
Shellworth ran "really easy"
in the intermediate hurdle pre
lims, then knocked an entire
second off his lifetime best to
finish third in 51.2 behind two
time Pac-8 champ Andrews and
Trojan Rich Craybehl.
The junior from Atherton

came oft the turn into the home
straightaway in fourth but
caught UCLA's Phil Mills in the
stretch to finish third and earn
an NCAA qualifying mark.
"Mills ran very hard in his
heat yesterday," Shellworth said
after the meet. "He went out real
fast but I knew he was faltering
near the end. 1 almost went blank
over the last hurdle but held on
to beat him."
Another school record
Shellworth came back to team
with Sheats, Lofton and CTordon
Hanks and shatter the school
mile relay mark with a 3:08.5
four-lap time in the 1600-meter
relay (the time converts to a
3:09.6 mile time). The old record
of 3:10.5 stood for 37 years. Lof
ton anchored the foursome with
a 45.4 split.
Two other Stanford athletes
turned in lifetime bests while
scoring points for the Cards.
Senior Steve Crowley broke
down and bought a new pair of
shoes last week to replace the
ones he had competed in since
his junior year in high school.
They apparently made quite a
difference as Crowley ran a
3:45.6 1500 meters, nearly four
seconds faster than his best, and
finished sixth.
Fast pace
Washington State's Joshua
kimeto took the 1500 field out
with a 58-second first lap,
brought the pack around the
800-meter mark in 1:58, crossed
the 1200-meter mark in 2:59,
then faded fast as the field pas
sed the pace-setting Kenyan.
Crowley passed the 1200-
meter mark in 3:00, five seconds
faster than his three-lap best.
"I tried to pop it on the last lap
but 1 didn't have it," Crowley
said. "That was the longest
straightaway I've ever run. I kept
looking up and thinking,
'Where's the tape?"'
DecathleteCarl Johnk finished
fifth in the two-day, 10-event
competition with 6588 points,
269 points better than his previ
ous best.

Tom Shellworth recorded
lifetime bests on the way to
third-place finishes in the 400
meters and the 400 intermediate
hurdles.
The long jump was touted as a
matchup between*Lofton and
USC's Larry Doubley and UC-
I ,A's Willie Hanks, both of whom
had beaten die Stanford junior
earlier in the season.
Lofton, who injured his ham
string last week in the West
(loast Relays, said he considered
Doubley more of a threat "be
cause Doubley considers himself
more of a threat. Hanks is think
ing about the triple jump."
Lofton opened with a 24-foot
jump and a foul, while Doubley
assumed the meet lead with a

25-10% leap in the second
round. Lofton gained the lead by
a quarter of an inch with a 25-11
mark on his third jump.
Then on his fifth jump, Lofton
hit the pit then bounded out with
his fists clenched and his arms
raised overhead in joy, knowing
that his 26-4 3 /4 jump was good
enough for his first Pac-8 crown.
Despite winning the shot put
by more than three feet with a
toss of 65-6'/2, American record
holder Albritton was less than
overjoyed about his technique in
Friday's competition.
Doesn't have it
"Motion is a funny thing—in
the shot put it lasts less than a
second. Sometimes you have it
and sometimes you don't...right
now 1 don't."
Whereas Albritton continues
to search for his record-setting
form, quarter-miler Sheats has
just found his. The Altadena
junior broke a 45-year-old Stan
ford mark (see accompanying
story) in the 400, finishing third
in 46.08 in Saturday's final.
Sheats recorded the fastest
time in the preliminary heats
Friday with a 46.32 lap.
"I tried to intimidate them in
the preliminaries." Sheats said
Friday. "1 want them to concede
first because they think it's al
ready sewed up."
No concession
Hut Andrews and his brother
Joel were not as psyched out as
the Cardinal sprinter had hoped,
finishing one-two in 45.57 and
45.80.
Shellworth ran "really easy"
in the intermediate hurdle pre
lims, then knocked an entire
second off his lifetime best to
finish third in 51.2 behind two
time Pac-8 champ Andrews and
Trojan Rich Craybehl.
The junior from Atherton

came oft the turn into the home
straightaway in fourth but
caught UCLA's Phil Mills in the
stretch to finish third and earn
an NCAA qualifying mark.
"Mills ran very hard in his
heat yesterday," Shellworth said
after the meet. "He went out real
fast but I knew he was faltering
near the end. 1 almost went blank
over the last hurdle but held on
to beat him."
Another school record
Shellworth came back to team
with Sheats, Lofton and CTordon
Hanks and shatter the school
mile relay mark with a 3:08.5
four-lap time in the 1600-meter
relay (the time converts to a
3:09.6 mile time). The old record
of 3:10.5 stood for 37 years. Lof
ton anchored the foursome with
a 45.4 split.
Two other Stanford athletes
turned in lifetime bests while
scoring points for the Cards.
Senior Steve Crowley broke
down and bought a new pair of
shoes last week to replace the
ones he had competed in since
his junior year in high school.
They apparently made quite a
difference as Crowley ran a
3:45.6 1500 meters, nearly four
seconds faster than his best, and
finished sixth.
Fast pace
Washington State's Joshua
kimeto took the 1500 field out
with a 58-second first lap,
brought the pack around the
800-meter mark in 1:58, crossed
the 1200-meter mark in 2:59,
then faded fast as the field pas
sed the pace-setting Kenyan.
Crowley passed the 1200-
meter mark in 3:00, five seconds
faster than his three-lap best.
"I tried to pop it on the last lap
but 1 didn't have it," Crowley
said. "That was the longest
straightaway I've ever run. I kept
looking up and thinking,
'Where's the tape?"'
DecathleteCarl Johnk finished
fifth in the two-day, 10-event
competition with 6588 points,
269 points better than his previ
ous best.

Clancy Edwards and Tom An

came a 50-point first-day deficit
to catch Washington State's
"Foreign Legion" and win their
fourth straight Pacific-8 track
and field title Saturday at UC
LA's Drake Stadium.
Edwards breezed to wins in
the 100 and 200. setting a col
legiate record with a 20.13 clock
ing in the latter, and anchored
Southern Cal's victorious 400-

incredibly grueling double,
winning the 400-meter dash and

Washington State, relying on
foreign athletes for 87 of its 132
second-place points, did not

3:45.6 1500 meters, nearly four
seconds faster than his best, and
finished sixth.
Fast pace
Washington State's Joshua
kimeto took the 1500 field out
with a 58-second first lap,
brought the pack around the
800-meter mark in 1:58, crossed
the 1200-meter mark in 2:59,
then faded fast as the field pas
sed the pace-setting Kenyan.
Crowley passed the 1200-
meter mark in 3:00, five seconds
faster than his three-lap best.
"I tried to pop it on the last lap
but 1 didn't have it," Crowley
said. "That was the longest
straightaway I've ever run. I kept
looking up and thinking,
'Where's the tape?"'
DecathleteCarl Johnk finished
fifth in the two-day, 10-event
competition with 6588 points,
269 points better than his previ
ous best.

Los Angeles— Led by sprinters
Clancy Edwards and Tom An
drews, the USC Trojans over
came a 50-point first-day deficit
to catch Washington State's
"Foreign Legion" and win their
fourth straight Pacific-8 track
and field title Saturday at UC
LA's Drake Stadium.
Edwards breezed to wins in
the 100 and 200. setting a col
legiate record with a 20.13 clock
ing in the latter, and anchored
Southern Cal's victorious 400-
meter relay Andrews copped an
incredibly grueling double,
winning the 400-meter dash and
the 400 intermediate hurdles.
Washington State, relying on
foreign athletes for 87 of its 132
second-place points, did not
have the depth to top the Tro
jan's 146-point total.
Cellar dwellers no more
Stanford finished seventh and
out of the conference cellar for
the first time in five years as
lames Lofton won the long jump,
Terry Albritton topped the shot
put field and Alan Sheats and
Tom Shellworth recorded
lifetime bests on the way to
third-place finishes in the 400
meters and the 400 intermediate
hurdles.
The long jump was touted as a
matchup between*Lofton and
USC's Larry Doubley and UC-
I ,A's Willie Hanks, both of whom
had beaten die Stanford junior
earlier in the season.
Lofton, who injured his ham
string last week in the West
(loast Relays, said he considered
Doubley more of a threat "be
cause Doubley considers himself
more of a threat. Hanks is think
ing about the triple jump."
Lofton opened with a 24-foot
jump and a foul, while Doubley
assumed the meet lead with a

25-10% leap in the second
round. Lofton gained the lead by
a quarter of an inch with a 25-11
mark on his third jump.
Then on his fifth jump, Lofton
hit the pit then bounded out with
his fists clenched and his arms
raised overhead in joy, knowing
that his 26-4 3 /4 jump was good
enough for his first Pac-8 crown.
Despite winning the shot put
by more than three feet with a
toss of 65-6'/2, American record
holder Albritton was less than
overjoyed about his technique in
Friday's competition.
Doesn't have it
"Motion is a funny thing—in
the shot put it lasts less than a
second. Sometimes you have it
and sometimes you don't...right
now 1 don't."
Whereas Albritton continues
to search for his record-setting
form, quarter-miler Sheats has
just found his. The Altadena
junior broke a 45-year-old Stan
ford mark (see accompanying
story) in the 400, finishing third
in 46.08 in Saturday's final.
Sheats recorded the fastest
time in the preliminary heats
Friday with a 46.32 lap.
"I tried to intimidate them in
the preliminaries." Sheats said
Friday. "1 want them to concede
first because they think it's al
ready sewed up."
No concession
Hut Andrews and his brother
Joel were not as psyched out as
the Cardinal sprinter had hoped,
finishing one-two in 45.57 and
45.80.
Shellworth ran "really easy"
in the intermediate hurdle pre
lims, then knocked an entire
second off his lifetime best to
finish third in 51.2 behind two
time Pac-8 champ Andrews and
Trojan Rich Craybehl.
The junior from Atherton

came oft the turn into the home
straightaway in fourth but
caught UCLA's Phil Mills in the
stretch to finish third and earn
an NCAA qualifying mark.
"Mills ran very hard in his
heat yesterday," Shellworth said
after the meet. "He went out real
fast but I knew he was faltering
near the end. 1 almost went blank
over the last hurdle but held on
to beat him."
Another school record
Shellworth came back to team
with Sheats, Lofton and CTordon
Hanks and shatter the school
mile relay mark with a 3:08.5
four-lap time in the 1600-meter
relay (the time converts to a
3:09.6 mile time). The old record
of 3:10.5 stood for 37 years. Lof
ton anchored the foursome with
a 45.4 split.
Two other Stanford athletes
turned in lifetime bests while
scoring points for the Cards.
Senior Steve Crowley broke
down and bought a new pair of
shoes last week to replace the
ones he had competed in since
his junior year in high school.
They apparently made quite a
difference as Crowley ran a
3:45.6 1500 meters, nearly four
seconds faster than his best, and
finished sixth.
Fast pace
Washington State's Joshua
kimeto took the 1500 field out
with a 58-second first lap,
brought the pack around the
800-meter mark in 1:58, crossed
the 1200-meter mark in 2:59,
then faded fast as the field pas

said. "That was the longest
