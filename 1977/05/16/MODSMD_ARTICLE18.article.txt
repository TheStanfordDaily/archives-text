# Eastman's mark falls

### Bruce Anderson 
It was 1932, Stanford graduate Herbert Hoover was president and
the United States was in the midst of the Depression.
It was also the year that Stanford runner Ben Eastman made the
sports world sit up and take note by trimming a full second off the
world quarter mile record, blazing around the dirt track at Angell
Field in 46.4.
Tall, blond and bespectacled, Eastman was one of the great middle
distance runners of his time. He set world marks for 400 and 800
meters and 440. 600, 880 and 1000 yards during his cinder career.
In his first year out of Burlingame High School. Eastman set a
Stanford freshman record for the quarter which stood for 35 years.
Ithe world mark he set in 1932 went unsurpassed, unequaled and.
tor the most part, unapproached as the school standard here for 45
years.
Saturday, junior Alan Sheats, showing little regard for athletic
legends, dethroned Eastman as the top Cardinal quarter miler when
he clocked a 46.08 400 meters to finish third in the F'acific-8 meet in
Los Angeles. The Altadena sprinter's mark converts to a 46.34 quar
ter mile.
Sheats had a metric best of 46.5 going into the conference meet. He
bettered that mark in Friday's preliminary heats, recording the best
mark of the afternoon with a 46.32 lap.
Sheats improved his time Saturday, as did the Andrews brothers,
Tom and Joel, of USC. Tom won in 45.57 while younger sibling Joel
finished second in 45.80.
But Sheats had something more elusive,than a Pac-8 title: he had
the 45-year-old school mark set by Blazin' Ben Eastman when
sororities were in and liquor was out.
