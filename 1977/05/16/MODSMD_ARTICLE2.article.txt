### 
Lisbon, Portugal (AP) — Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale said yesterday
that Andrew Young's proposed trip to
segregated South Africa, focus of a
continuing diplomatic flap, is "defi
nitely on."
Mondale also said the arrangements
were "completely satisfactory"'' to
Young, the black U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations.
A Young aide had said Saturday the
ambassador might cancel the trip be
cause the South African government
was setting "stringent conditions."
But Mondale, on the second day of a
European tour, told reporters the State
Department had "definitely con
firmed" the trip late Saturday.
Mondale and Young crossed paths
here for a day of tennis, tourism and

private talk, conferring on African is
sues as a prelude to Mondale's meeting
with South African Prime Minister
John Vorster and Young's sessions
with black nationalist leaders in Af
rica.
'Touched base'
Officials traveling with Mondale
and Young said after their IV2-hour
meeting that the two had "touched
base" in view of the "highly complex,
manifold and fast-moving develop
ment" of U.S. policy on southern Af
rica. Young interrupted a two-week
African tour to meet with Mondale.
The ambassador had issued a state
ment earlier yesterday on the South
African trip saying, "We are . . . mov
ing ahead to complete detailed ar
rangements for the visit. I am confi
dent that these will be concluded in a
mutually satisfactory manner."
On Saturday, Young aide Stoney
Cook said the visit might be called off
because the South African government
was setting stringent conditions and
Young would not want to go as an
"honorary white," an official status
sometimes given to important visiting
nonwhites to avoid conflict with the
country's laws of strict segregation.
The South Africans have said they
would have "no objections" to
Young's visiting their country next
weekend.
Racial policies
Mondale is scheduled to meet with
Vorster in Vienna Thursday to discuss
the southern African situation, and the
vice president is expected to press
Vorster for change in South Africa's
racial policies.
Mondale said there is no connection
between Young's South African visit
and his own sessions with Vorster.
Vorster, meanwhile, warned in a
newspaper interview that other na
tions would not be able to change the
way South Africa handles its domestic
affairs.
"South Africa is an independent
country and certainly nobody from the
outside can dictate how it should run
its country or its domestic affairs,"
Vorster told Vienna's Kronenzeitung.
Mondale, although expected to
make clear the U.S. commitment to
black majority rule in southern Africa,
said he would not be "negotiating with
Vorster for the purpose of achieving
some solution for these problems."

African tour to meet with Mondale.
The ambassador had issued a state
ment earlier yesterday on the South
African trip saying, "We are . . . mov
ing ahead to complete detailed ar
rangements for the visit. I am confi
dent that these will be concluded in a
mutually satisfactory manner."
On Saturday, Young aide Stoney
Cook said the visit might be called off
because the South African government
was setting stringent conditions and
Young would not want to go as an
"honorary white," an official status
sometimes given to important visiting
nonwhites to avoid conflict with the
country's laws of strict segregation.
The South Africans have said they
would have "no objections" to
Young's visiting their country next
weekend.
Racial policies
Mondale is scheduled to meet with
Vorster in Vienna Thursday to discuss
the southern African situation, and the
vice president is expected to press
Vorster for change in South Africa's
racial policies.
Mondale said there is no connection
between Young's South African visit
and his own sessions with Vorster.
Vorster, meanwhile, warned in a
newspaper interview that other na
tions would not be able to change the
way South Africa handles its domestic
affairs.
"South Africa is an independent
country and certainly nobody from the
outside can dictate how it should run
its country or its domestic affairs,"
Vorster told Vienna's Kronenzeitung.
Mondale, although expected to
make clear the U.S. commitment to
black majority rule in southern Africa,
said he would not be "negotiating with
Vorster for the purpose of achieving
some solution for these problems."
Lisbon, Portugal (AP) — Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale said yesterday
that Andrew Young's proposed trip to
segregated South Africa, focus of a
continuing diplomatic flap, is "defi
nitely on."
Mondale also said the arrangements
were "completely satisfactory"'' to
Young, the black U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations.
A Young aide had said Saturday the
ambassador might cancel the trip be
cause the South African government
was setting "stringent conditions."
But Mondale, on the second day of a
European tour, told reporters the State
Department had "definitely con
firmed" the trip late Saturday.
Mondale and Young crossed paths
here for a day of tennis, tourism and

private talk, conferring on African is
sues as a prelude to Mondale's meeting
with South African Prime Minister
John Vorster and Young's sessions
with black nationalist leaders in Af
rica.
'Touched base'
Officials traveling with Mondale
and Young said after their IV2-hour
meeting that the two had "touched
base" in view of the "highly complex,
manifold and fast-moving develop
ment" of U.S. policy on southern Af
rica. Young interrupted a two-week
African tour to meet with Mondale.
