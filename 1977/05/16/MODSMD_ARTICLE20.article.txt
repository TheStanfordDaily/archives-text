# Season closes on a disappointing note
## Card nine gives 3 to Cal 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Plagued by a case of Friday the
13th bad luck and a host of bad
calls, the 1977 Stanford basebal I
team concluded its season by
dropping a three-game series to
the California Bears. The Cardi
nals were defeated 9-8 on Friday
in the last game at Sunken
Diamond this season, and drop
ped both games to Cal, 7-5 and
7-6, Saturday at Berkeley.
"It was a very disappointing
way to end the season," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We
could have won all three. The
games were indicative of the
whole season...we left a lot of
men on base not getting the big
hits."
Stanford trailed Cal from the
start of t he game in Friday's con
test. not getting on the
scoreboard until the fifth inning
and waiting until the eighth and
ninth innings to rally for seven
runs. After the Cardinals pulled
within one run of the Bears in the
ninth, a controversial force-out
of Larry Reynolds at second base
and Cary Scott's pop-out to the
second baseman ended the
game.
Three-run homer
Cal scored nine runs in Fri
day's game, five of them on a
three-run homerun in the second
inning and a controversial two
run homerun in the third. In the
second inning with two men
down and a man on second, Cal
firstbaseman Bob Bohnet hit the
ball deep to centerfield where
Mike Codiroli watched it go
under the fence. But the umpires
ruled the ball landed over the
fence and allowed Bohnet to
round the bases.

Saturday's games proved to be
just as disappointing for the
Cards with Rob Irwin absorbing
the 7-5 loss in the first game, and
senior John Yandle finishing his
Stanford career with the 7-6 loss
in relief of starter Jerry Argust.
Stanford had a chance to win
the final game when in the
eighth inning they tied the score
5-5 and went ahead H-5 in the
ninth on an rbi single by l'epe
Hinojosa. Hinojosa's hit scored
shortstop Dave Perez who
reached first on a Cal error and
moved into scoring position by
stealing second base.
But Cal had their final say in
the bottom of the ninth when
they came back to score two runs
on a walk, a wild pitch by Yandle
and three base hits.
Stanford finishes the season
with a new most games won re

cord of -4:5-2.) for 1977 despite its
5-1 i record in league play.

Stanford trailed Cal from the
start of t he game in Friday's con
test. not getting on the
scoreboard until the fifth inning
and waiting until the eighth and
ninth innings to rally for seven
runs. After the Cardinals pulled
within one run of the Bears in the
ninth, a controversial force-out
of Larry Reynolds at second base
and Cary Scott's pop-out to the
second baseman ended the
game.
Three-run homer
Cal scored nine runs in Fri
day's game, five of them on a
three-run homerun in the second
inning and a controversial two
run homerun in the third. In the
second inning with two men
down and a man on second, Cal
firstbaseman Bob Bohnet hit the
ball deep to centerfield where
Mike Codiroli watched it go
under the fence. But the umpires
ruled the ball landed over the
fence and allowed Bohnet to
round the bases.

Saturday's games proved to be
just as disappointing for the
Cards with Rob Irwin absorbing
the 7-5 loss in the first game, and
senior John Yandle finishing his
Stanford career with the 7-6 loss
in relief of starter Jerry Argust.
Stanford had a chance to win
the final game when in the
eighth inning they tied the score
5-5 and went ahead H-5 in the
ninth on an rbi single by l'epe
Hinojosa. Hinojosa's hit scored
shortstop Dave Perez who
reached first on a Cal error and
moved into scoring position by
stealing second base.
But Cal had their final say in
the bottom of the ninth when
they came back to score two runs
on a walk, a wild pitch by Yandle
and three base hits.
Stanford finishes the season
with a new most games won re

cord of -4:5-2.) for 1977 despite its
5-1 i record in league play.

Card hurdler Tom Shellworth (left) battles Southern Cal'sTom Andrews in a preliminary heat of the
400 intermediates at the Pacific-8 championships over the weekend. Shellworth finished third in
the intermediate finals Saturday with a lifetime best of 51.2, while Andrews won his second
conference intermediate title.
Plagued by a case of Friday the
13th bad luck and a host of bad
calls, the 1977 Stanford basebal I
team concluded its season by
dropping a three-game series to
the California Bears. The Cardi
nals were defeated 9-8 on Friday
in the last game at Sunken
Diamond this season, and drop
ped both games to Cal, 7-5 and
7-6, Saturday at Berkeley.
"It was a very disappointing
way to end the season," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We
could have won all three. The
games were indicative of the
whole season...we left a lot of
men on base not getting the big
hits."
