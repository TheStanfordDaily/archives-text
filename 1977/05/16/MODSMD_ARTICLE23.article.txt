Haitians starve during drought
Anse Kouge, Haiti — Severe drought this year
— the worst in three years of sparse rainfal I — has
brought hundreds of thousands of Haitians tothe
brink of starvation, relief officials say.
"What happened this year is that some rural
people on the borderline of starvation started to
starve," one foreign official said.
Relief workers here in north-western Haiti say
they have received reports of several dozen
deaths from starvation, but because of poor
communication it is impossible to confirm them.
Desperation is evident in this bleak, drought
stricken town.
Thirteen-year-old Elanise, shoeless and wear
ing a torn dress, begged visitors to take heir with
them to work as a servant.
Unlike the drought of 1975, this year's has not
been limited to the northwest. Thousands of
people also are near starvation on the offshore
island of Gonave, on the north side of the coun
try's central plateau and along a 40-mile stretch
of the south coast, Haitian Red Gross and relief
experts said.
A major relief effort is under way to provide
440,000 persons in these areas with a 1500-
calorie-a-day diet of beans, wheat, oil and pow
dered milk over the next four to six months. This
is still 700 calories below the minimum United
Nations-recommended diet of 2200 calories a
day.
The Haitian Red Ooss estimates that 19,470
tons of food will be needed. The United States
has already supplied more than 3000 tons of food
and West Germany 250 tons. The Canadian gov
ernment is considering sending 3300 tons. Most
of the food is being distributed through interna
tional relief agency "food for work" programs,
aimed more at soil conservation rather than di
rect handouts.

U.N. charged with hiring bias
Washington — Although the United States
pays the largest share of the cost for the United
Nations and its agencies, Americans are under
represented on the U.N. staff, a congressional
study says.
And the U.S. influence on the way these inter
national agencies operate is in danger of being
diminished further, the General Accounting Of
fice (GAO) warns.
Americans make up only 13 per cent of U.N.
employes hut pay 25 per cent of the organiza
tion's costs, the study said.
Developing nations are pressuring U.N. offi
cials to hire more of their citizens, while the U.S.
government fails to "aggressively recruit" qual
ified Americans to work in the U.N. agencies, the
GAO said.
Last fall the United States accused Secretary
(General Kurt YValdheim of bowing to political
pressures in hiring U.N. staff members.
A U.S. delegate charged that under the guise of
seeking equitable geographic distribution, the
U.N. was hiring underqualified staff members.
At its upper reaches, the U.N. staff includes
some of the world's highest-paid bureaucrats.
Professional salaries range up to $71,000, with
thousands of dollars more in benefits.
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.), whose Se
nate Governmental Affairs committee released
the GAO report yesterday, said the State Depart
ment should conduct a nationwide recruiting ef
fort to find more Americans suited lor U.N. ser
vice and encourage them to apply for jobs.
Former U-Chicago head dies
Santa Barbara — Robert Maynard Hutchins,
one of the leading educators of the 20th century
who became president of the University of

Chicago at age 30 and eliminated football from
the Big Ten school asanunacademicfrill, is dead
at 78.
Hutchins had undergone surgery in March for
a kidney ailment. He suffered a relapse about a
week ago, doctors said, and died late Saturday
night.
Hutchins' later years were spent as president of
the Center for the Study of Democratic Institu
tions, which he founded in 1959.
He was regarded as a boy wonder when he was
named dean of the Yale Law School at 2H, two
years after graduating magna cum laude from the
school. At 30, he went to the University of
Chicago and became the youngest person ever to
head a major college.
At Chicago, his controversial reforms drew
widespread attention and left their mark on col
leges across the nation. Emphasizing the value of
general education over specialization, Hutchins
allowed students to enter the university after two
years of high school, ended compulsory class
attendance and granted degrees after two years to
students who could pass a comprehensive test.
He angered many alumni and students when
he dropped football at the university, proclaim
ing: "Football, fraternities and fun were designed
to make a college education palatable for those
who shouldn't be there."
Funeral reveals polygamist's past
Salt Lake City — The weekend funeral of slain
polygamist leader Rulon Allred brought into the
open a rarely seen underground version of the
Mormon religion.
Allred, an excommunicated Mormon had
never been recognized publicly as a religious
leader before the funeral.
The 71-year-old naturopathic physician was
shot to death Tuesday by two women who en

tered his officeand fired six times at him in front
of at least five witnesses. Police are looking for
the assailants.
Allred had at least six wives — police sources
put the number at 11 — and more than 40 chil
dren. Thirty-six of his children participated in
the funeral Saturday.
He treated illnesses without drugs or surgery
and was said by his brother to have delivered
more than 6000 babies.
The brother, Owen Allred, said the murdered
religious leader lived and gave up his life for the
same principles as Joseph Smith, founder of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints (Mor
mon).
