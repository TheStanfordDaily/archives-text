# Petitions to recall three ASSU senators halted
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Craduate students are "not going to
bother to hold an election" to recall
graduate ASSU Senators Tom Devine,
jim King and Jeff Stoler because the
students did not get the necessary 800
signatures to hold the election, accord
ing to Deric Jennings, former Council
of Presidents (COP) member.
Jennings wrote and distributed a
petition to graduate students three
weeks ago, asking that those senators
be recalled after King and Stoler's fake
attempt to recall ASSU Financial
Manager Chris Mathe.
"I think at the moment we have 400
to 500 signatures," said Jennings. Bas
ically, at this point we're toning
down."
Jennings said although there will
not be an election, he did feel he got
across his main points.
"Despite the ASSU Senate Chair
man's differing opinion, people in the
senate and COP are accountable. My
other point was to communicate to the
graduate community they should pay

more attention to what goes on in the
senate," Jennings explained.
King said he though the number of
signatures collected "shows that most
students don't share Jennings' view of
student government."
"It was a constructive attempt,"
king added. "I think it will make
senators more accountable in the fu
ture, just as I hope our attempt to recall
Mathe will make future ASSU officers
more accountable also."
"The whole thing was very stupid,"
commented Stoler. "It served no pur
pose except to damage us. I'm dis
turbed that he would go to such
lengths as to put letters in graduate
students' boxes."
"I thought it was disgusting for Jen
nings to put coupons to cash in for a
recall in the boxes of every law stu
dent." commented King,
"A lot of people were reluctant to
sign the petitions," Jennings said, be
cause the drive was started late in the
year.
