# India may get U.S. uranium
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Carter ad
ministration is nearing a decision to
deliver part of a long-overdue ship
ment of uranium fuel to India—but
only if India opens its secret nuclear
installations to inspection.
India, which needs the uranium to
keep its big nuclear power complex
near Bombay working, must agree to
negotiated a new nuclear cooperation
pact with the United States opening up
all facilities and processes to interna
tional surveillance, senior U.S. offi
cials said yesterday.
They stressed that India was not
being singled out for the strict condi
tions of sale.
The administration is preparing an
over-all strategy for renegotiating its
nuclear cooperation arrangements
with nearly 30 countries that use
U.S.-made nuclear plants, materials,
fuel and technology.
India's situation, however, has as
sumed urgency. Under an existing
contract, India last year ordered 12
tons of slightly enriched uranium for
its nuclear power system at Tarapur
which lights the homes and feeds the
factories and farms on which 40 mill
ion people depend.
Slow the spread
Rut the shipment was held up first
by former President Gerald Ford's ad
ministration, then by the Carter ad
ministration, because new U.S.
policies were evolving to stop or slow
the spread of nuclear weapons.
The Indians claim Tarapur now is
running short of fuel and soon may be
in danger of shutting down. They
argue also the uranium fuel for which
they are waiting needs months of pre
paration before it can be used.

U.S. officials said a demand for a
new agreement with India would be
consistent with President Jimmy Car
ter's efforts to stop the proliferation of
nuclear weapons.
Carter has vowed to do everything
he can to stop or slow the spread of
nuclear bombs —yet without denying
foreign nations the peaceful uses and
benefits of nuclear energy develop
ment.
Bound to insist
India has refused to sign the world
non-proliferation treaty. Under a bill
that Carter proposed and sent to Con
gress last month, the United States
would be bound to insist on what are
called "full scope safeguards" in sup
plying nuclear materials to nations
that are not parties to the treaty.
This means insisting on the rights of
inspection and surveillance, at least by
the International Atomic Energy
Agency in Vienna, over all nuclear in
stallations and processes in the coun
try concerned.
India would be expected to open up
even those secret plants in the state of
Rajastan where a nuclear device of
about 15 kilotons—ls,ooo tons of
TNT —was detonated in 1974.
India also has built its own reproces
sing plant at Tarapur. This plant can be
used for extracting plutonium, a
manmade element, from the spent
nuclear fuel discharged by the Tarapur
power reactors. Plutonium, along with
highly enriched uranium, is what
gives atomic bombs their explosive
force.
Likely to resent
Initially, at least, India is likely to
resent any such U.S. conditions for de
livery of the uranium.
India refused to sign the non
proliferation treaty on grounds it dis
criminated against those states that
did not build nuclear weapons. Some
of India's nationalist-minded leaders
inevitably would regard the new U.S.
conditions as a proof of their argu
ment.
In private, however, some U.S. dip
lomats have gotten the impression
from their Indian colleagues that they
see the point of Carter's over-all cam
paign against the spread of nuclear
arms. They add that the U.S.
position—which in general is backed
by the Soviets —would be more con
vincing if the two superpowers were to
live up to the treaty commitment they
made to cut back their own nuclear
arsenals.
The Americans seem bound to run
into similar difficulties with other
countries that have not signed the tre
aty, including South Africa, Taiwan.
Israel and Brazil.
They are among 24 nations which
the Carter administration has invited
to join in a program to reappraise all
aspects of future nuclear energy de
velopment. The Carter initiative has
the aim of advancing the peaceful uses
of nuclear energy but blocking the
techniques that could lead to the
emergence of new nuclear weapons
states.

Washington (AP) — The Carter ad
ministration is nearing a decision to
deliver part of a long-overdue ship
ment of uranium fuel to India—but
only if India opens its secret nuclear
installations to inspection.
India, which needs the uranium to
keep its big nuclear power complex
near Bombay working, must agree to
negotiated a new nuclear cooperation
pact with the United States opening up
all facilities and processes to interna
tional surveillance, senior U.S. offi
cials said yesterday.
They stressed that India was not
being singled out for the strict condi
tions of sale.
The administration is preparing an
over-all strategy for renegotiating its
nuclear cooperation arrangements
with nearly 30 countries that use
U.S.-made nuclear plants, materials,
fuel and technology.
India's situation, however, has as
sumed urgency. Under an existing
contract, India last year ordered 12
tons of slightly enriched uranium for
its nuclear power system at Tarapur
which lights the homes and feeds the
factories and farms on which 40 mill
ion people depend.
Slow the spread
Rut the shipment was held up first
by former President Gerald Ford's ad
ministration, then by the Carter ad
ministration, because new U.S.
policies were evolving to stop or slow
the spread of nuclear weapons.
The Indians claim Tarapur now is
running short of fuel and soon may be
in danger of shutting down. They
argue also the uranium fuel for which
they are waiting needs months of pre
paration before it can be used.

U.S. officials said a demand for a
new agreement with India would be
consistent with President Jimmy Car
ter's efforts to stop the proliferation of
nuclear weapons.
Carter has vowed to do everything
he can to stop or slow the spread of
nuclear bombs —yet without denying
foreign nations the peaceful uses and
benefits of nuclear energy develop
ment.
Bound to insist
India has refused to sign the world
non-proliferation treaty. Under a bill
that Carter proposed and sent to Con
gress last month, the United States
would be bound to insist on what are
called "full scope safeguards" in sup
plying nuclear materials to nations
that are not parties to the treaty.
This means insisting on the rights of
inspection and surveillance, at least by
