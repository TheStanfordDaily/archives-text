# Cheek-to-cheek with Koko the gorilla
## 
### Bonny Rodden 
I was sent out to cover a story and I
ended up in the arms of a gorilla.
I always knew being 5-foot-3 and
female would some day get me into
trouble.
As it turns out, having those hairy
arms and leathery hands caressing my
body and face wasn't so bad after all.
Anyway, it was for a good cause.
Koko is a 5V2-year-old gorilla who
lives in a trailer near the Stanford
Museum. But this isn't your average
115 pound, approximately three foot

gorilla.
koko can "talk." koko communi
cates to trainer Penny Patterson using
over 300 sign language gestures.
Patterson, a Ph.D. candidate here,
has been studying koko since the ape
was a baby to determine how koko
learns language skills.
Koko stays?
However, koko may not be at Stan
ford much longer if Patterson cannot
raise $12,500 by mid-July to buy her
from the San Francisco Zoo. If Patter
son cannot raise the sum, koko will be
returned to the zoo which originally
lent her to the Gorilla Foundation, a
non-University research group.
Patterson fears koko will "die of a
broken heart" if she is separated from
her trainer.
Saving koko was the purpose of a
media event on Thursday. Television
•crews and newspaper photographers
converged on the playground near
koko's trailer to watch a representative
from Paramount Pictures present the
ape and her trainer with a $1000 check.
Before koko emerged from her
trailer, the Paramount publicity
woman warned, "koko will first hug
the shortest female member of the
group. Then he (sic) will want to meet
all of you."
(The publicity woman never ac
cepted the fact that koko is female. As
koko and Patterson stepped out of the
trailer, she said, "Just look at him.
You'll be able to tell.")
koko lumbered out of the trailer
wearing a yellow sweater and a locked
chain around her neck. A long leash
trailed from the chain to Patterson's
land.

The publicity woman was right,
koko headed directly for the Daily's
5-foot-3 female reporter and wrapped
her long hairy arm around my waist.
She pulled me down to her level so her
brown eyes could stare into mine. It's a
bit unnerving being eyeball to eyeball
with a gorilla.
Patterson motioned to koko that my
yellow jacket was the same color as
koko's sweater. How nice, koko was
not "listening." She was too infatuated
stroking my face and holding my hand
— my left hand, the one with which I
was supposed to be taking notes.
"She's grooming your face," Patter
son said.
At one point, koko grabbed my pen
cil and scrawled on my notebook. She
forced the pencil to my mouth. I
thought she was trying to mimic the
television reporters talking into mic
rophones. •
"koko likes to eat erasers," Patter
son said. Apparently, she wanted to
share her favorite treat with her new
found friend. Luckily, someone had
gotten to the eraser before koko or I
had a chance to taste it.
koko left me free to scrawl a few
notes as she introduced herself to the
other journalists. She hugged
everyone. A television reporter
squealed after koko lifted her skirt.
Patterson explained that koko
"speaks" in sentences "on the average
of three to four gestures but can go up
to 12." Patterson is particularly in
terested in discovering if koko uses
her own rules when "speaking."
After koko had met the media.
Paramount's San Francisco Branch
Manager Ron I.itvin officially pre

sented the check to koko and Patter
son. The check brought the total col
lected to $7000, according to Patter
son.
Paramount has also donated a $3000
film print of the latest king kong to the
Gorilla Foundation for a benefit show
ing Wednesday at 8 p.m. at Palo Alto's
Fine Arts Theatre.
As the television crews and photo
graphers drifted off. koko sat on a
tricycle watching them through the
cyclone fence.
Her attention strayed from me to a
young child standing outside the
fence. At last, someone was shorter
than I.
