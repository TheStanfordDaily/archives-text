## Opinions National health insurance: a viable alternative 
### 
We must have a more honest, rational debate
between proponents and opposers of National
Health Insurance (NHL). Among persons who are
supposed to know the merits and drawbacks of
NHI there is considerable disagreement. This may
reflect a lack of knowledge, political motivations
extraneous to the issue, philosophical beliefs, or
all of the above. The original issue is frequently
lost in the morass of "data" supplied by opinion
advocates.
The recent editorial (Daily. May 11) is a good
example of not addressing the issues. The reader
was presented with a variety of potential problems
with socialized medicine and NHI, including in
creased costs in the face of unlimited demand for
medical services, burdensome government regula
tion. establishment of bureaucratic implementa
tion agencies and maldeliverv of services within
other socialized health care systems. 1 applaud the
recognition of these factors as potential problems
in a new health care system.
The unsupported implications of the editorial
were that the potential problems of NHI are insur
mountalbe. the present system, with a booster shot
for Medicaid, can meet the challenge of our pre
sent health care crisis and socialized medicine is
definitely undesireable. I disagree with these im
plications.
The potential problems with NHI may be solva
ble. The author is justified in criticizing the state
ment that with National Health Insurance, "no
American ever again would have to pay a doctor's
bill." The implication made is that NHI will try to
pay lor everything.
The actual cost is paid, however, by the tax
payer. One should note that in four models of NHI
popular at present (i.e. - Feldstein, Ellwood.
McClure and British) this problem is recognized
and potential solutions are explored. Educating
the public in cultivating reasonable expectations
of the system would be part of these solutions.
British model
There is little proof to suggest government in
volvement in establishing NHI will result in in-

creased costs and unncessary bureaucracy. The
author used the British model as an example of a
system with these problems. Through the National
Health Service Britain spends five per cent ol its
GNP on health care. The comparable figure lor the
11nited States is eight per cent.
Per capita expenditures for health care in Britain
are also less. There is no proof to suggest that the
overall standard of health among the British is
significantly different from that among Ameri
cans. I do not claim that the British system will
work when taken verbatim out of its socio
economic context but it is an example of success,
not failure.
The specter of poor care in Britain presented by
the author is misleading. Each of us can point to
instances of patient maltreatment in the United
States now (witness the malpractice issue) as well
as in Britain. In addition, as a person treated within
the British health care system for more than a year.
I can say the gross picture of disorganization pre
sented by the author is far from my experience.
Economic crisis
The health care crisis is. in one sense, an
economic crisis. Not only are our health care ex
penditures eight per cent of the present GNP, but
the percentage is rising steadily. Simply pumping
more money into the existing Medicaid program
ignores an investigation of the causes of escalating
health care costs. Unfortunately, the author does
not examine the causes of the present health care
crisis yet offers a solution.
The author also asserts that socialized medicine
is undesireable. This statement is anachronistic;
we already exist in a largely socialized health care
system. The government presently pays 40 per
cent of all annual health care costs, and its percent
share of medical expenditures is rising. Our medi
cal system is socialized; given the system, the
realistic question at hand is how to administer the
best possible care of realistic cost and quality.
National Health Insurance implementation
would require cautious, pragmatic planning to en
sure equity among individuals likely to be affected
by so drastic a change. I'erliaps more pragmatic
solutions will appear as pressure increases to find
alternatives. Many responsible people are study
ing plans of NHI. and if the previous author's
reasoning is indicative of the opposition, propo
nents of NHI should receive more attention.
Simply pouring dollars into Medicaid fails to
examine the causes of the present health care
crisis. It is comforting to know that responsible
proponents of NHI do not claim to offer a Utopian
paradise. It is disturbing to know that some oppo
nents would offer a band-aid for the cure of cancer.
