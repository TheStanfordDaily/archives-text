There; a re several thousands of
Palestinian political prisoners in
the occupied territories. These
include people over HO and chil
dren under 1 :i years. They either
belong toa social organization or
have participated in a peaceful
demonstration, or distributed
pamphlets. These people are ac
cused of acts of terrorism (acts
carried out m the defense of t heir
country and their land).
Torture is often used in Israel
but the most frequent cases
occur in the occupied territories
to incite people to confess. These
confessions once signed by the
prisoner can no longer be re
voked. It is, by the way, infi
nitely more difficult for a lawyer
to defend a prisoner who has
signed a confession than it is to
defend a person under adminis
trative detention.
In an interview with Israel
Shahak. he said: "... I want you
to know that the interrogation ol
Palestinians is always carried
out when these men are naked.
They are beaten on the sensitive
parts of their body. namely, their
genital organs. The next stage
sometimes lasts very long. Usu
ally it consists of locking the
prisoner always naked in a solit

ary cell measuring lm x 2m (lm
equals ii.:i ft.) and buiit of rough
concrete with sharp edges.
The prisoner is not even given
a blanket. The third stage is re
served for the more hardened. It
consists of tying their hands for
long periods with elastic bands
and then hanging them down
either from the window or from
the heavy steel door of the cell."
With My Own Eyes is a book
published by Felicia I.anger
where she mentions several
cases of torture she had seen on
the bodies of prisoners she had
defended. In an address to the
Association of Arab-American
University Graduates in New
York (litv in October 1976,
I,anger said: ". . . torture is used
during investigation! I declare it
as a lawyer who has dealt with
thousands of cases. I have seen
marks of torture on the bodies of
hundreds of my clients; the re
cent ones were (and she men
tined several names). I knew
prisoners who went mad as a re
sult of torture (she also men
tioned several names).
Slow death
Scores of people have died in
prisons as a result of torture, or
are condemned to a slow death
because of a lack ot medical

treatment.
Amnesty International has in
vestigated several cases of tor
ture in'lsraeli prisons for both
Palestinians and Oriental Jews,
and some reports about these
cases have been published. Hut,
despite all these terroristic mea
sures which are openly and
clearly contravening all the
maxims of the law of nations, the
struggle against the occupation
is going on, because its roots
ensue from an invincible love for
the homeland.
Thousands prefer the prison
cells, prefer to die in demonstra
tions, rather than surrender to
the occupiers. Palestinian flags
are raised by children: victims ol
the Israeli soldiers are buried .is
heros in Nablus. Hebron and
Jerusalem, while others swear to
continue their struggle.
Koenig report
The "top secret" memoran
dom partly reproduced below
substantiates the I '.N. resolution
which equates Zionism with ra
cism and racial discrimination.
Anyone still doubting the equa
tion of Zionism with racism is
encouraged to study the Koenig
report closely. A state cannot he
Jewish if the majority of its
people are non-Jews, and Dr.

Yisrael koenig, Israel's District
Representative in the North for
the past 1:i years, has followed
Zionism to its logical conclu
sion: where there are too many
Arabs, get rid of them.
koenig's proposals amount to
"wholesale discrimination"
(Jerusalem Post, September 9,
H)7fi), but they are nothing new.
"Judaization" is Israel's official
policy for solving the "demog
raphic problem" (too many
Arabs) in Galilee. Arab lands
have long been expropriated for
Jewish settlements in "the
northern district."
Support for koenig's prop
osed solution comes from Jewish
mayors in Galilee towns. Says
Baruch Wanger of Carmiel:
"I,<!t's not be ashamed to state
publicly that we want a Jewish
majority inGaliliee." (Jerusalem
Post, September 21, 197(i.)
Writer Moshe kohn defends
the koenig report: "The docu
ment's detractors ... largely
forget that Zionism's primary
aim was not to establish the
world's first model liberal or
socialist democracy. It was to re
store sovereign Jewish life. .
