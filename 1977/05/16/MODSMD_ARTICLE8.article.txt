## Racist South Africa, Griffin for mascot 
### 
South Africa
As someone who was born and
grew up in oppressive racist
South Africa. 1 would like to ex
press my disgust and strong dis
agreement with lan van Castel's
1 (itter (I)ailv. May (i). that South
Africa is not that bad.
The daily merciless oppres
sion of black people in South Af
rica. whether as transient and
voiceless labor units for the
economy, or as domestic ser
vants i rr the homes of their white
oppressors is rivaled by few re
gimes in recent history. The
myriad of laws such as the Pass
Laws, the Group Areas Act, the
Suppression of Communism
Act. the !>(> Day Law, the total
denial of black political rights
and police intimidation, must be
an insult to even the most timid
concerns for human justice and
dignity.
Van Castel's letter is indica

tive of everything that is pater
nalistic and prejudiced in white
South Africa. Assuming that
black people were not dissatis
fied liefore the recent Soweto up
rising (which is ridiculous), and
given the uprisings and the on
going resistance in South Africa,
how can he possibly say that
"South Africa is very quiet"?
If South Africa is quiet, it is
because police states work best
in silence. Screams are more eas
ily muffled.
It is quite clear that if van Gas
tel lived in South Africa for 11
years he never ventured beyond
the fringes of the white suburbs
into any one of numerous black
ghettos, or else his blinkers were
very effective.

Griffin power
The article on the Criffin writ
ten by Bruce Anderson (Daily.
March 30) was enough to get this
old alum back in touch with his
alma mater. I graduated back in
1975 and played varsity football
in the fall of 1972-74. I was a
Card at the height of Car
dinalism.
Cardinal ism is at once dull
and meaningless as well as in
teresting and confusing. In 197.5
and 1974 we opened our seasons
at Penn State watching a Lion (of
the Nittany species) chasing a
big red bird (a cardinal?!?)
around the field while John
Cappeletti et al. stormed
through a paper sign reading
"flip the birds."
In towns we traveled to we
would read about how our "Big
Birds" Pat Donovan and Roger
Stil 1 wel 1 were going to get

plucked, flipped, or stuffed.
1 was part of the original New
Deal of 1972 and the Big Deal of
1974. This year is also being cal
led a "New Deal."
Previous to all this we were
the Indians. This discriminatory
and insenstive use of a people's
heritage has been stopped and
rightly so. There .ire hangers-on
who will and are trying to revive
the racist use of the Indian.
Hopefully, the administration
will stick to their promise to the
American Indians and their
supporters of forever preventing
the return of the Indian mascot.
There is no reason not to believe
them.
Anderson's article has ex
posed a unique, nonoffensive,
viable alternative to the mascot
question. The Griffin is Califor
nia, red, intelligent, moral,
impressive-looking and "cannot
be beaten bv Bears." No race or

creed would be offended by the
Griffin and it affords no embar
rassment to the administration (a
la Thunderchickens and Robber
Barons).
The athletic department has
hired a new football coach for
next season. They have also
hired a new water polo coach
and women's field hockey
coach. The baseball and soccer
coaches are currently in their
first year and the basketball
coach has just completed his
second. This year was vol
leyball's first year as a varsity
sport and next year marks the
first year for women's gymnas
tics and women's cross country
as varsity sports. Things are
happening on the Stanford
sports scene. Let's include the
Griffin in the "New Deal" of
1977. Support the Stanford Grif
fin!!
