# Senate recommends less funding
## 
### Sue Lesjak 
The ASSU Senate voted seven to one
last night to recommend funding for
only one ASSU representative to the
Billboard Conference of rock and roll
agents in New York rather than the two
proposed by ASSU Financial Manager
Chris Mathe.
Sen. Brad krevoy opposed the re
commendation.
The conference, a meeting of many
important rock and roll agents, has
been attended bv special events direc
tors in the past. The money for the trip
is taken out of special events funds, not
the ASSU general fund.
Mathe explained he was in the pro
cess of deciding how much money io
contribute to this year's trip when the
matter came to the attention of the se
nate. According to Mathe, he was con
sidering subsidizing the plane fare and
registration fee for both current Spe
cial Events Director Dave knowles and
incoming director, Mark Curtis. Mathe
said he would allocate no more than
$500. (Last year $750 was allocated.)
Several of the senators, including
Tim Ferguson, said they didn't feel it
was necessary to send both knowles
and Curtis, particularly since knowles
is an outgoing director.
Curtis said knowles' presence at the
conference would be of great benefit to
him because of knowles' previous
contacts.
Although the senate voted against
funding the trip for two, the ultimate
decision rests with Mathe.
Also at last night's meeting, the se
nate passed nine to one a motion by
Sen. Steve Wurzburg urging the Uni
versity to reconsider its decision to
place the 55-foot long Albers Wall at
the proposed site by the Physics Tank.
Wurzburg's resolution calls for the
University to hold public hearings to
discuss the proposed and alternate
sites.
krevoy asked Assoc. Provost Ed
Shaw whether any senate recommen
dation would carry weight with the
ad ministration.
Shaw replied. "Of course student
input is important and carries
weight." He explained that the ad
ministration is in the process of recon
sidering alternate sites and any in
formed opinions were welcome.
Me stressed, however, that although
it was not too late to reverse the Uni
versity's decision to erect the
sculpture, the University already has
made serious commitments. "We have
already accepted the gift of the
sculpture and made the commitment.
The issue now is just whether to dis
continue our plans."
The senate also passed a resolution
by Sen. John Paval establishing a
commission to continue investigating
student government reforms.
