# Human rights and Iranian repression

Saeed Kadivar

The Iranian regime is well
known throughout the world for
its repressive policies, including
torture. However, Secretary of
State, Cyrus Vance, who met
with theShah of Iran in Tehran a
few days ago, said that, . . the
United States does not intend to
link its massive arms sales to
Iran with the issue of human
rights." (S.F. Chronicles-14-77).
Besides the continuing arms
sales, the Carter Administration

is actively helping to maintain
the wavering stability of the
Shah's regime in other ways.
Recently William Sullivan
was nominated by Carter as Am
bassador to Iran, replacing
Richard Helms, the ex-head of
the C.I.A. Sullivan has a rather
dubious history, especially in
regard to human rights. He was
chairman of the Vietnam Work
ing Group (1963-1964) which
planned the bombing of North

Vietnam.
From 1964-1968 he was the
U.S. Ambassador to Laos and
Chief of Mission there. He over
saw the massive bombing cam
paign in Laos, which included
many non-military targets, such
as numerous villages. From
1973-1977 he was the Ambas
sador to the Philippines, his
duty being mainly that of
counter-insurgency "expert," to

help stop the growing move
ment in the Philippines for
democracy.
It is very clear that the nomina
tion by the Carter Administra
tion of Sullivan as Ambassador
to Iran is not to encourage the
implementation of human rights
in Iran, but rather to aid the rep
ressive rule of the Shah.
