## Injustice to anti-apartheid fight 
### 
apart'heid ( e -par-tat,tit) n.
(Afirk., lit., separateness): racial
segregation; specif: a policy of
segregation and political and
economic discrimination
against non-European groups in
the Republic of South Africa.

If last week was protest week,
surely this must be reflection
week. Those of us who thought
we would spend our four years
here without ever seeing a police
officer in full riot gear found
ourselves mistaken last Monday
as 294 students were arrested at
Old Union.
While the cause for which
they allowed themselves to be
led off in handcuffs was a noble
one and indeed brought much
needed attention to an issue
which should attract every per
son of moral conscience, the tac
tics and rhetoric of the SCRIP
leaders did injustice to their
cause.
A complex issue of American
foreign policy, human rights and
international diplomacy cannot
be reduced to "Apartheid means
profits and Stanford won't stop
it." Exemplified by signs read
ing "Will YOU oppose apar
theid?", the prevailing mental
ity for the week seemed to reason
that either you joined the rallies,
carried a banner and wore an
armband or clearly you were a
white supremist.
The week could almost be
summed by relating the follow
ing incident:

A petition was shoved at me
on White Flaza Tuesday. "Here,
sign this," the girl ordered.
"What does it say?" I inquired.
"It says that you're against apar
theid in South Africa," she said.
Well, of course I am. But that's
not what the petition said. After
reading it I passed it on, not hav
ing decided whether the tactics
called for therein were necessar
ily the most logical or the most
beneficial to the view that both
the girl and 1 shared — that apar
theid must end.

A key to any sort of de
magoguery is to produce a
scapegoat at which to vent all of
one's anger. Enter the Board of
Trustees. Accuse them of "com
plicity with apartheid" and
issue demands upon them.
Then, the logic (or illogic) goes,
if they don't meet those de
mands. clearly, they are de
votees of white supremacy.
Next, refer on Tuesday to the
president of the University of
"Herr Lyman," the provost and
university officials as "his lac
keys" and the Santa 'Clara
County Sheriff's Department as

"storm troopers." Ignore all op
tions and demand "Stanford get
out of South Africa yesterday."
(All direct quotes from Tues
day's White Plaza rally.)
A fact which the SCRIP lead
ers seem totally to ignore is this:
No one argues in favor of apar
theid. As President Lyman said:
"The issue is not one of prin
ciple but of tactics: what path of
action relating to the proxy vote
is most likely to have a construc
tive effect, given the objective of
moving away from apartheid
and towards racial justice in
South Africa?"
It is legitimate to argue that
since U.S. interests in South Af
rica make up only four per cent
of foreign investments there,
that a U.S. withdrawal would
have little effect on the stability
of the current government.
Moreover, it could be argued,
that it is better for the U.S. to
remain, and continue to exercise
fair hiring practices and refuse to
recognize the government
imposed racial caste system.
Further, South African law re
quires that any nation withdraw
ing must turn over the profits
from such a sale into South Afri
can government bonds for five
years. Thus, would not with
drawal have the effect of
strengthening the current gov
ernment rather than the reverse?
Assume the alternate premise,
namely, that U.S. companies do
play a major role in the South
African economy. Milton
Friedman has pointed out that
despite the appalling system of
white supremacy, that South Af
rican blacks have the highest
standard of living on the conti
nent. If this hypothesis is true
what would U.S. withdrawal do
to the per capita income of a na
tion already in the throes of a
recession? Assuming majority
rule did not result, would a
lower standard of living absent
U.S. investment be preferable to
the current situation?

This raises a larger issue: if
widespread depression did oc
cur, would civil war and
bloodshed be the result?
Many Third World nations
have looked to the Soviet Union
and even to Cuba for assistance.
Neither of these nations can lie
called leaders in the areas of in
dividual freedom — their re
cords are quite the contrary.
They are among the most repres
sive societies in the world. Is
their "moral" influence in South
Africa to be preferred over ours?
Another facet worthy of
examination: The Ford Motor
Co. is currently constructing the
world's largest truck production
plant in the Soviet Union. Civen
the Russian record of suppres
sion of dissidents and their con
sentration camps, Jewish im
migration, and of worldwide ex
pansion, should Ford be in
volved in strengthening their
economy? Why not extend the
logic to have Stanford divest it
self of investments in all com
panies who deal with the Com
munist bloc?
While we do not attempt to
answer these rhetorical queries
here, they are legitimate and de
serving of discussion. They can
not be reduced to chanting
phrases, loudspeakers and
marches, nor seen as questions
of "we" vs. "them," student vs.
trustee or those with moral con
science vs. those without.
History shows the elements of
successful demogoguery:
Armbands, mass rallies and
scapegoats have been seen be
fore. They serve to suppress
rather than promote freedom.
They appeal to mass emotion
rather than to individual reason.
Such tactics are unnecessary
and do great injustice to a view
that so many of us share and to
the dream we have of someday
seeing individual freedom for all
the people of the world.

profits and Stanford won't stop
it." Exemplified by signs read
ing "Will YOU oppose apar
theid?", the prevailing mental
ity for the week seemed to reason
that either you joined the rallies,
carried a banner and wore an
armband or clearly you were a
white supremist.
The week could almost be
summed by relating the follow
ing incident:

A petition was shoved at me
on White Flaza Tuesday. "Here,
sign this," the girl ordered.
"What does it say?" I inquired.
"It says that you're against apar
theid in South Africa," she said.
Well, of course I am. But that's
not what the petition said. After
reading it I passed it on, not hav
ing decided whether the tactics
called for therein were necessar
ily the most logical or the most
beneficial to the view that both
the girl and 1 shared — that apar
theid must end.

A key to any sort of de
magoguery is to produce a
scapegoat at which to vent all of
one's anger. Enter the Board of
Trustees. Accuse them of "com
plicity with apartheid" and
issue demands upon them.
Then, the logic (or illogic) goes,
if they don't meet those de
mands. clearly, they are de
votees of white supremacy.
Next, refer on Tuesday to the
president of the University of
"Herr Lyman," the provost and
university officials as "his lac
keys" and the Santa 'Clara
County Sheriff's Department as

"storm troopers." Ignore all op
tions and demand "Stanford get
out of South Africa yesterday."
(All direct quotes from Tues
day's White Plaza rally.)
A fact which the SCRIP lead
ers seem totally to ignore is this:
No one argues in favor of apar
theid. As President Lyman said:
"The issue is not one of prin
ciple but of tactics: what path of
action relating to the proxy vote
is most likely to have a construc
tive effect, given the objective of
moving away from apartheid
and towards racial justice in
South Africa?"
It is legitimate to argue that
since U.S. interests in South Af
rica make up only four per cent
of foreign investments there,
that a U.S. withdrawal would
have little effect on the stability
of the current government.
Moreover, it could be argued,
that it is better for the U.S. to
remain, and continue to exercise
fair hiring practices and refuse to
recognize the government
imposed racial caste system.
Further, South African law re
quires that any nation withdraw
ing must turn over the profits
from such a sale into South Afri
can government bonds for five
years. Thus, would not with
drawal have the effect of
strengthening the current gov
ernment rather than the reverse?
Assume the alternate premise,
namely, that U.S. companies do
play a major role in the South
African economy. Milton
Friedman has pointed out that
despite the appalling system of
white supremacy, that South Af
rican blacks have the highest
standard of living on the conti
nent. If this hypothesis is true
what would U.S. withdrawal do
to the per capita income of a na
tion already in the throes of a
recession? Assuming majority
rule did not result, would a
lower standard of living absent
U.S. investment be preferable to
the current situation?

This raises a larger issue: if
widespread depression did oc
cur, would civil war and
bloodshed be the result?
Many Third World nations
have looked to the Soviet Union
and even to Cuba for assistance.
Neither of these nations can lie
called leaders in the areas of in
dividual freedom — their re
cords are quite the contrary.
They are among the most repres
sive societies in the world. Is
their "moral" influence in South
Africa to be preferred over ours?
Another facet worthy of
examination: The Ford Motor
Co. is currently constructing the
world's largest truck production
plant in the Soviet Union. Civen
the Russian record of suppres
sion of dissidents and their con
sentration camps, Jewish im
migration, and of worldwide ex
pansion, should Ford be in
volved in strengthening their
economy? Why not extend the
logic to have Stanford divest it
self of investments in all com
panies who deal with the Com
munist bloc?
While we do not attempt to
answer these rhetorical queries
here, they are legitimate and de
serving of discussion. They can
not be reduced to chanting
phrases, loudspeakers and
marches, nor seen as questions
of "we" vs. "them," student vs.
trustee or those with moral con
science vs. those without.
History shows the elements of
successful demogoguery:
Armbands, mass rallies and
scapegoats have been seen be
fore. They serve to suppress
rather than promote freedom.
They appeal to mass emotion
rather than to individual reason.
Such tactics are unnecessary
and do great injustice to a view
that so many of us share and to
the dream we have of someday
seeing individual freedom for all
the people of the world.

one's anger. Enter the Board of
Trustees. Accuse them of "com
plicity with apartheid" and
issue demands upon them.
Then, the logic (or illogic) goes,
if they don't meet those de
mands. clearly, they are de
votees of white supremacy.
Next, refer on Tuesday to the
president of the University of
"Herr Lyman," the provost and
university officials as "his lac
keys" and the Santa 'Clara
County Sheriff's Department as

"storm troopers." Ignore all op
tions and demand "Stanford get
out of South Africa yesterday."
(All direct quotes from Tues
day's White Plaza rally.)
A fact which the SCRIP lead
ers seem totally to ignore is this:
No one argues in favor of apar
theid. As President Lyman said:
"The issue is not one of prin
ciple but of tactics: what path of
action relating to the proxy vote
is most likely to have a construc
tive effect, given the objective of
moving away from apartheid
and towards racial justice in
South Africa?"
It is legitimate to argue that
since U.S. interests in South Af
rica make up only four per cent
of foreign investments there,
that a U.S. withdrawal would
have little effect on the stability
of the current government.
Moreover, it could be argued,
that it is better for the U.S. to
remain, and continue to exercise
fair hiring practices and refuse to
recognize the government
imposed racial caste system.
Further, South African law re
quires that any nation withdraw
ing must turn over the profits
from such a sale into South Afri
can government bonds for five
years. Thus, would not with
drawal have the effect of
strengthening the current gov
ernment rather than the reverse?
Assume the alternate premise,
namely, that U.S. companies do
play a major role in the South
African economy. Milton
Friedman has pointed out that
despite the appalling system of
white supremacy, that South Af
rican blacks have the highest
standard of living on the conti
nent. If this hypothesis is true
what would U.S. withdrawal do
to the per capita income of a na
tion already in the throes of a
recession? Assuming majority
rule did not result, would a
lower standard of living absent
U.S. investment be preferable to
the current situation?

This raises a larger issue: if
widespread depression did oc
cur, would civil war and
bloodshed be the result?
Many Third World nations
have looked to the Soviet Union
and even to Cuba for assistance.
Neither of these nations can lie
called leaders in the areas of in
dividual freedom — their re
cords are quite the contrary.
They are among the most repres
sive societies in the world. Is
their "moral" influence in South
Africa to be preferred over ours?
Another facet worthy of
examination: The Ford Motor
Co. is currently constructing the
world's largest truck production
plant in the Soviet Union. Civen
the Russian record of suppres
sion of dissidents and their con
sentration camps, Jewish im
migration, and of worldwide ex
pansion, should Ford be in
volved in strengthening their
economy? Why not extend the
logic to have Stanford divest it
self of investments in all com
panies who deal with the Com
munist bloc?
While we do not attempt to
answer these rhetorical queries
here, they are legitimate and de
serving of discussion. They can
not be reduced to chanting
phrases, loudspeakers and
marches, nor seen as questions
of "we" vs. "them," student vs.
trustee or those with moral con
science vs. those without.
History shows the elements of
successful demogoguery:
Armbands, mass rallies and
scapegoats have been seen be
fore. They serve to suppress
rather than promote freedom.
They appeal to mass emotion
rather than to individual reason.
Such tactics are unnecessary
and do great injustice to a view
that so many of us share and to
the dream we have of someday
seeing individual freedom for all
the people of the world.

apart'heid ( e -par-tat,tit) n.
(Afirk., lit., separateness): racial
segregation; specif: a policy of
segregation and political and
economic discrimination
against non-European groups in
the Republic of South Africa.
—Webster's New Collegiate Dic

If last week was protest week,
surely this must be reflection
week. Those of us who thought
we would spend our four years
here without ever seeing a police
officer in full riot gear found
ourselves mistaken last Monday
as 294 students were arrested at
Old Union.
While the cause for which
they allowed themselves to be
led off in handcuffs was a noble
one and indeed brought much
needed attention to an issue
which should attract every per
son of moral conscience, the tac
tics and rhetoric of the SCRIP
leaders did injustice to their
cause.
A complex issue of American
foreign policy, human rights and
international diplomacy cannot
be reduced to "Apartheid means
profits and Stanford won't stop
it." Exemplified by signs read
ing "Will YOU oppose apar
theid?", the prevailing mental
ity for the week seemed to reason
that either you joined the rallies,
carried a banner and wore an
armband or clearly you were a
white supremist.
The week could almost be
summed by relating the follow
ing incident:

A petition was shoved at me
on White Flaza Tuesday. "Here,
sign this," the girl ordered.
"What does it say?" I inquired.
"It says that you're against apar
theid in South Africa," she said.
Well, of course I am. But that's
not what the petition said. After
reading it I passed it on, not hav
ing decided whether the tactics
called for therein were necessar
ily the most logical or the most
beneficial to the view that both
the girl and 1 shared — that apar
theid must end.

A key to any sort of de
magoguery is to produce a
scapegoat at which to vent all of
one's anger. Enter the Board of
Trustees. Accuse them of "com
plicity with apartheid" and
issue demands upon them.
