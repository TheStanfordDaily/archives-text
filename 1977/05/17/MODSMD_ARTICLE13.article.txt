## Wall under fire 
### 
As founding members of the
McCullough Organization for
Unrestricted Campus Access, we
have developed a number of
suggestions which would en
hance the artistic merits of the
wall:
1) In keeping with the ar
chitectural unity of the campus
we feel that the wall should be
fitted with a red tile roof.
2) For safety reasons, doors
should be placed every five met
ers along the wall.
3) In order not to impede the
flow of students from one por
tion of the campus to another, a
bicycle ramp should be con
structed over the wall.

4) In this period of energy
shortage, we feel the energy cost
involved in shipping rock from
Africa or Texas or wherever
should be partially repaid by
covering the surface of the wall
with solar cells. '
5) If a 54-foot (16.46-meter)
wall is really necessary, why not
build it vertically, which would
not only be far more impressive,
but would also be out of the way
(Hoover Monolith).
6) The proposed horizontal
wall would substantially cut off
our view of the rest of the cam
pus. Recent experience gained at
the Medical Center parking lots
should be applicable for the in
stallation of a closed circuit tele
vis ion system which would
solve this problem.
7) For security reasons and to
protect against vandals, guard
towers should be built at both
ends of the wall, along with
barbed wire, tank traps, sear
chlights and all other amenities
associated with similar walls.
VVe feel that the addition of
these few simple improvements
would vastly improveourability
to deal with this monstrosity on
a daily basis.
