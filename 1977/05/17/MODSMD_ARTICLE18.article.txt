# GM's future cars: smaller, costlier
## 
### 
Detroit (AP) — If you're shop
ping for a new General Motors
car in 1985, you may discover:
—There are no more V8 en
gines.
—Every fourth car is powered
by a diesel engine, which gets
better fuel economy than a
gasoline engine.
—GM's "large" cars will
weigh :M)0 pounds less than to
day's compacts.
—More cars will have front
wheel drive to increase interior
space.
—It will take a minimum 15 to
18 seconds for a GM car to accel
erate from 0 to 60 miles per hour,
including the sporty Corvette,
compared with a minimum 10-
to 12-second range today.
—Prices may be larger even
though the vehicle is smaller.
Those are some of the observa
tions contained in a report GM
recently submitted to the Na
tional Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
'Scenario'
The agency asked for a
"hypothetical scenario" of what
cars in the 1981 -85 period would
be like as a result of federal fuel
economy laws which require
new cars to average 27.5 miles
per gallon (mpg) in 1985. The
auto makers' 1977 car fleets av
erage between 16 and 19 mpg.
CM, the nation's largest auto
maker, has made public portions
of its report. Ford Motor Co. has
not released its report, and
Chrysler's was not immediately
available. However, Ford and
Chrysler are expected to go the
same route as CM. which builds
more than half the vehicles pro
duced in the United States.
GM cautioned that its conclu
sions do not represent final pro
duct plans, noting that "there is
no guarantee that the consumer
will buy the products.
". . . automobile design is
going to be changed more radi
cally in the next several vears

than in any comparable period
in the past," thecompany said in
a letter accompanying its report.
Relief
CM said it based its scenario
on assumptions that the industry
would get some relief from
proposed toughening of emis
sions standards, and that there
would be no major technological
break throughs.
Since fuel economy is affected
more by a vehicle's weight than
any other factor, CM said its
basic approach to better mileage
is to make its cars smaller and
lighter with smaller engines.
CM wouldn't comment on
prices specifically, but it said
costs would go up — a good in
dication of what will happen to
prices. CM said the cost increase
is due to changes needed to
maintain a car's safety, perfor
mance and durability traits as it
gets smaller and the use of new
lightweight materials that are
more expensive.
CM said it spent $1.1 billion to
make its fulls-size cars smaller
tor 1977, and that was "as mod
est a program as possible."
"As we go lorward, down
sizing may require the use of
tront wheel drive components,
all new engines, all new trans
missions, etc.
"The cost of such programs
wil I be substantially higher than
our 1977 program, which was
largely able to utilize many car
ryover mechanical compo
nents."

no guarantee that the consumer
will buy the products.
". . . automobile design is
going to be changed more radi
cally in the next several vears

than in any comparable period
in the past," thecompany said in
a letter accompanying its report.
Relief
CM said it based its scenario
on assumptions that the industry
would get some relief from
proposed toughening of emis
sions standards, and that there
would be no major technological
break throughs.
Since fuel economy is affected
more by a vehicle's weight than
any other factor, CM said its
basic approach to better mileage
is to make its cars smaller and
lighter with smaller engines.
CM wouldn't comment on
prices specifically, but it said
costs would go up — a good in
dication of what will happen to
prices. CM said the cost increase
is due to changes needed to
maintain a car's safety, perfor
mance and durability traits as it
gets smaller and the use of new
lightweight materials that are
more expensive.
CM said it spent $1.1 billion to
make its fulls-size cars smaller
tor 1977, and that was "as mod
est a program as possible."
"As we go lorward, down
sizing may require the use of
tront wheel drive components,
all new engines, all new trans
missions, etc.
"The cost of such programs
wil I be substantially higher than
our 1977 program, which was
largely able to utilize many car
ryover mechanical compo
nents."
Detroit (AP) — If you're shop
ping for a new General Motors
car in 1985, you may discover:
—There are no more V8 en
gines.
—Every fourth car is powered
by a diesel engine, which gets
better fuel economy than a
gasoline engine.
—GM's "large" cars will
weigh :M)0 pounds less than to
day's compacts.
—More cars will have front
wheel drive to increase interior
space.
—It will take a minimum 15 to
18 seconds for a GM car to accel
erate from 0 to 60 miles per hour,
including the sporty Corvette,
compared with a minimum 10-
to 12-second range today.
—Prices may be larger even
though the vehicle is smaller.
Those are some of the observa
tions contained in a report GM
recently submitted to the Na
tional Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
'Scenario'
The agency asked for a
"hypothetical scenario" of what
cars in the 1981 -85 period would
be like as a result of federal fuel
economy laws which require
new cars to average 27.5 miles
per gallon (mpg) in 1985. The
auto makers' 1977 car fleets av
erage between 16 and 19 mpg.
CM, the nation's largest auto
maker, has made public portions
of its report. Ford Motor Co. has
not released its report, and
Chrysler's was not immediately
available. However, Ford and
Chrysler are expected to go the
same route as CM. which builds
more than half the vehicles pro
duced in the United States.
GM cautioned that its conclu
sions do not represent final pro
duct plans, noting that "there is
no guarantee that the consumer
will buy the products.
