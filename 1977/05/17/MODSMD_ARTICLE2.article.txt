"TheCarter administration has done
more to make people aware of human
rights in 90 days than any other ad
ministration has in a long time," Al
lard Lowenstein, U.S. Envoy to the
U.N. Human Rights Commission, said
last night.
Speaking in Annenberg Auditorium
on the "Role of Human Rights in U.S.
Foreign Policy," Lowenstein said that
on the balance sheet "we have taken
the small step toward broadening
humanitarian concern."
He said the moment does not come
often when people "get off their cyni
cism," and organize their energies
long enough to help. Lowenstein said
cynicism is healthy, but too much
complex analysis causes an atmos
phere of "psychic immobility."
Lowenstein said people should take
advantage of the forces available to
them and try to help by showing sup
port for organizations which are seek
ing forms of change.
"If we fail, at least we go out trying
and not sneering," he said.
President Jimmy Carter has started a
different sense of what the United
States, the United Nations and human
spirit are all about, said Lowenstein.
The former New York congressman
said it is important to realize there is
potential in the human rights efforts of
the government.
The potential can be realized if there
is a universal notion of human rights

policy, all governments agree to dis
cuss their affairs, false hopes are not
raised, and limits are realized, he said
It is "very important that a dominant
coalition work evenhandedly with
each and every country concerned
wherever it may be," said Lowenstein.
The issue of human rights is not how
to end racism in oppressed countries
but "how to end human suffering and
do what is most essential — deciding
where to begin." Lowenstein said.
If the United States is going toask for
human rights abroad, then it had better

practice it at home, he said. "Or else,
there will be bitterness at home and
resentment abroad."
Lowenstein said dealing with our
own injustices is of urgency because
the universal notion cannot be
founded on hypocrisy.
Earlier in the day. Lowenstein dis
cussed the issue of the University's in
vestments in apartheid South Africa.
He said students' protests were "very
helpful in expressing the concerns of
private citizens in that kind of com
mitment."
