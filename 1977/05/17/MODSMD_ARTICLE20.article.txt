## Film/john nielsen Alien changes style in 'Annie Hall' 
### 
Annie lltill, or The Woody
Allen Story, is a movie about a
skinny, red-haired schlemeil
comedian with No-Doz man
nerisms and masochistic wit. It
isa roughly directed movie, with
a whiney, indulgent tone and a
vaguely disturbing aftertaste. It
is also the best film that Woody
Allen has ever made.
Some people, 1 suppose, will
not like this movie, for the sim
ple reason that some people do
not think that Woody Allen is
funny. Hut that's their fault.
Those of us who appreciate Al
len's maladjusted, miserable
humor will find Annie a gem.
The audience arrives to find
that the schlemeil comedian
(traveling under the alibi "Alvy
Singer") has lost his girlfriend

(Diane keaton). Unable to un
derstand how such a thing could
happen, Alvy conducts a guided
tour of his life and psyche, in an
effort to discover some causes.
Needless to say, what follows
is unbearably funny. We see the
young Singer, in his home ud
nerneath the roller coaster on
Coney Island, shattered by the
discovery that the universe is
expanding. We see his first mar
riage, ruined when the husband
begins using kennedy assassina
tion conspiracy theories to avoid
sex.
And so it goes, until the audi
ence begins to notice that the
tour guide doesn't seem tobe en
joying himself. At first we ignore
it, because everybody knows
that straight faces are forbidden

during Woody Allen films. By
the end, however, the attitude is
so pronounced that we feel
downright guilty at having had
such a good time.
Again, this is a new thing in
Woody Allen movies, and it
takes awhile to adjust. For
example, when Diane keaton
sang her second song, 1 kept
waiting for the microphone to
fall over, or for her to forget the
words. When nothing of the kind
happened, I turned to my
notebook and captured the
beauty of the song, and the
beauty of keaton's performance,
with the words "not funny."
The unsettling undertone dis
tinguishes A nnie from all of Al
len's earlier work. Bananas,
Take the Money and Hun and
Everything You Always Wanted
to know About Sex are too dis
joi nted to allow emphathy to de
velop, while Sleeper and Love
(ind Death are too exotic. Even
Play It Again, Sam is lacking in
this respect, since the audience

knows, from beginning to end,
that Sam is a fairy tale, with a
fairy tale finish.
Annie isn't. Annie, at root, is a
sad story, with sad characters,
and a sad ending. To use a
deeply revealing phrase, it is a
movie with depth.
Woody Allen movies until
now have been exercises in
comic overkill. Because they
never once let up. the crowd be
gins to lose its enthusiasm after
an hour or so. What had been
hilarious becomes repetitive,
almost dull, no matter how slick
the direction. Despite ourselves,
we begin to wish he would shut
up for a minute.
But Annie lets the ribs rest
from time to time, thereby keep
ing itself fresh. Its not a new
technique, (note how often this
movie is compared with Charlie
Chaplin's work), but it has been
all but forgotten ot late. Woody's
onto it now, though. I only hope
he uses it some more.
