## '3 Women': film as art 
### 
In .1 Women, Robert Altman
has written, directed, and pro
duced a film which confirms the
potential for art, for cinematic
poetry, in American motion pic
tures. It is a sometimes bewilder
ing, often flawed depiction of
psychological communion and
interchange between three
neurotic women living in a
California desert community.
I'inky and Millie are occupa
tional therapists at a depressing
health spa for the aged. They
move into a "poolside" aprtment
house for young adults owned
by a bizarre artist, Willie, and her
super-macho husband, who also
operate a ranch-style bar with a
target range.
The movie focues on
psychological themes: the mys
tery of personality, the instinct
of death (thanatos), the sexual
motivations of behavior, the
pursuit of identity. In the tradi
tion of the great film artist
Bergman, it treats these
phenomena with the subjective
imagery and feeling of poetry,
putting objectivity to the side.
For approximately the first
third of its running time, the
movie intrigues the viewer with
its strangeness; but it also re
pulses with its confusion.
Things seem directionless,
while disturbing music and
sterile landscapes play havoc
with the nerves. The ending of
the movie is a complete failure.
Only toward the middle does
one realize that Altman is doing
something exceptional and ex
cellent with film. He escapes the
boredom of cliche while talking
about a subject, the unconscious
mind, which has been driven
into the ground in the twentieth
century. He restores vitality and
life to Freudian concepts which
have become everyday, reflexive
and bloodless. We see in his
story the organic mystery which
the reality of the unconscious
holds for all of us. Altman has
given form to the formless: he
has structured a story around the
anarchic machinations of the
unconscious mind. That is his
achievement and his art.
Film, like the short story, has
been called an "American art
form.'' So far, this is not really
true. Motion pictures have been
an American craft, film, a Euro
pean art form. The craft of film

emphasizes storytelling for the
sake of entertainment and in
terest. Whether the story in ques
tion be a comedy, like The Sting,
or an epic, like The Godfather,
content of the story is all
important. The art of film em
phasizes form. That is, the form
attempts to be the content, as in
music, and, to a lesser extent,
poetry.
We have had very few cinema
tic poets â€” Chaplin, keaton,
Orson Welles in his youth, Todd
Browning when he made Freaks,
Stanley Kubrick. Altman may
join their ranks. The fascination
of his film derives from its form,
from his original, innovative,
self-assured uses of camera di
rection. He seems acutely con
scious of every aspect of the
medium with which he works.
He orchestrates mood with cam
era motion, camera distance.

color, composition, depth of
field, and interactions of these
elements. The colors yellow and
purple, for example, become
more than symbols in the pic
ture, for Altman turns them into
subject and mysteries in their
own right. He successfully
changes form into content.
Film as craft and pure enter
tainment is certainly valuable
and needed, but there is no
reason why we shouldn't have
film as art too. A current of
poetry is already in motion in
U.S. movies: McCabe und Mrs.
Miller and Midnight Cowboy are
narrative poetry, Sleuth is un
rhymed poetry, Owl Creek
Bridge is a sonnet, and Little Big
Man is epic poetry. In the future,
for the sake of our culture, it is to
be hoped that this current will
break, into a new wave of Ameri
can cinema as art.
