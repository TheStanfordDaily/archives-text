## Shearing moodless 
### 
1 once had a piano teacher who
told me about the "footbeat." He
said that if you keep your left
foot tapping solidly, an essential
feeling of rhythm will be created
in your playing. He then de
monstrated with a tune and as 1
studied his left foot, I im
mediately sensed the distinct
rhythmic feel. "That gets people
up and dancing," he concluded.
My teacher and George Shear
ing are two of a large school of
jazz piano players whose style is
based on several key concepts:
strict classical training for
technique, unfaltering sense of
rhythm, perfect contrast of soft
touch and ringing tone, and an
endless repertoire.
Shearing played solo for the
last half-hour of his set at Great
American Music Hal I last Friday
evening. He played the "Theme
from I.ove Story." interjecting
Walt Disney-type riffs and lay
ing the whole arrangement on a
background of Bach's "Joy." It
was a brilliant display of musical
knowledge and technical com
mand of the piano.
Shearing sang and played
"Send in the Clowns," made
famous by Sinatra. His voice is
low and gruff .

He played a tribute to Errol
Garner: "Misty." In the middle,
he interrupted his fluid, roman
tic arrangement with a mimic of
Garner's jumpy, staccato lilt.
The set opened with the
George Shearing Quintet, but
what Shearing started doing
with a quintet in 1949 was done
much better shortly thereafter,
and still is, by countless other
groups.
Shearing plays something
akin to cool jazz, but cool jazz
relies on unique arrangements
which set a mood for improvisa
tion and, although Shearing
began some interesting ar
rangements, the individual solos
were repetitious and disre
guarded any vestige of mood.
The guitarist (Rob Whitsitt)
and vibist (Ron Combes) are
young and very competent but
their solos were uninspiring and
seemed to grip each piece and
restrain it from growing. Drum
mer Rusty Jones used an unvary
ing series of the same few beats
throughout the set.
Only bassist Chris Ham
burger emerged from the stag
nant atmosphere, to some extent,
with several difficult and
dominating solos.
