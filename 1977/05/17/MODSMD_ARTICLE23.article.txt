## Drama department's 'As You Like It' flawed but entertaining 
### 
The drama department is
commemorating Memorial
Hall's fortieth anniversary with a
production of William Shakes
peare's As You Like It. The pas
toral comedy is based on
Thomas Lodge's Roscilynde:
Euphues Golden Legacie, a
popular novel whose third edi
tion appeared in 1 598. The Bard
of Avon wrote his play between
that time and 1600.
The main character of As You
Like It is Rosalind, daughter of
the exiled Duke Senior. Duke
Frederick, the usurper and uncle
to Rosalind, banishes his niece
who flees to the forest of Arden
with her cousin, Celia, but not
before Rosalind falls in love with
Orlando. Orlando is the son of
the late Sir Roland De Bois, a
friend of Duke Senior but an
enemy of Duke Frederick. Or
lando seeks refuge from Duke
Frederick in the forest with his
old servant, Adam. There he
meets Rosalind, dressed as the
boy Ganymede, who teaches him
to see love realistically and ends
his writing of dreadful verse.
Linda Morrissey, as Rosalind,
occasionally captures the play
ful wisdom of her character but,
more often, misses it. Her scenes
with Orlando (David Bryant),
never quite reach the peaks of
irony present in the text.

Bryant's role is a simpler one but
the lack of a strong Rosalind
obscures the evidence of Orlan
do's progress from an unnur
tured younger son to a gentle
man.
More royal
Celia (Ellen Adamson)
achieves a greater bearing of
royalty and control than any of
her relatives — including the
dukes. On occasion, however,
she and Rosalind speak so
quickly as to be unintelligible.
When comprehensible their ex
changes with Touchstone
(Stephen McFarland), are clever
and enjoyable.
McFarland plays his part well
as the ill-intentioned, mischiev
ous, and discerning fool. Jaques
(Doyne Mraz), tries to emulate
Touchstone but fails.
Touchstone is a successful fool
because of his incredible apathy
but Jacques is melancholy and
bitter. The character of Jacques is
difficult and evasive. Mraz cer
tainly conveys the bitterness of
Jacques but not his "most
humorous sadness."
Smaller but still delightful
parts were those of the insipid,
love-struck Silvius (S. Michael
Bowen); the sluttish, haughty
shepardess, Phebe (Valerie De
Jose); and Touchstone's undulat
ing country wench, Audrey (Ali

son Parker).
Some of my criticisms of the
play are not due to the acting but
the interpretation of characters
by director Leigh Sealy. Duke
Senior (Mark Moskowitz) too
jolly and callous for a man in
exile, for example. And, as men
tioned earlier, Jacques and
Rosalind never achieve the per
sonalities which Shakespeare
created.
Fluidity
Sealy, however, does an ad
mirable job in controlling the
movements and action on stage
and produces a fluidity of mo
tion which carries the play
quickly through each act.
The production is located in
Little Theatre, behind Memorial
Auditorium. The small theatre is
a warm and comfortable setting
for As You Like It. The set, by
William Eddelman, consists of
two raised platforms on either
side of the stage, and a
background of trees and flowers.
The stage floor, platforms, and
background are painted in the
blue and greens of the Arden
forest.
Although most of the play's
action occurs in the woods, the
attractive set adapts easily to the
court scenes as well. While a
single set can be boring and de
tracting, the lack of scene
changes and variability of Ed
delman's set give the production
a continuity of action.
The lighting design, by
Michael Ramsaur and Jonathan
Mills, contributed to the diver
sity of the set. Never blatant or
artificial, the subtle warning and
dimming of lights indicates
moods and time of day without
bombarding the audience with
obvious symbolism. Dimming
also accompanies exists so that
entrances always seem to be at a
new location.
Forest hues
The costumes, also designed
by William Eddelman, compli
ment his set perfectly. As the aci
ton of the play, and the charac
ters, move into the Arden forest
their attire becomes simpler and
they adopt the hues of the forest.
Costumer Barbara Cleveland
spares no expenditure of time
and money as the garments are
beautifully sewn with an abun

dance of rich velvets. Rather
than distracting one's attention
from the action of the play, the
costumes enhance.
The music, directed by Sarah
Mead, and performend by her
self, Kent Underwood and Dale
Herman, also enhanced As You
Like It. The recorder, cello, and
mandolin help in setting the
time, as well as making the
play's songs and wedding scene
more entertaining.
Underwood, Herman and
Mead also play for an interlude
of dancing by spirits of the
woods. While the dancing is not
done badly, Shakespeare in
cluded no mention of such a
scene in his play. Comic inter

ludes were often used in order to
alleviate the mood of a tragedy,
but this play is no tragedy. It
adds nothing to the production
but time and a lapse of con
tinuity. If a scene does not con
tribute then it derogates and I
must conclude that the choreog
raphical efforts of Susan Cashion
are wasted.
The flaws in the production
stand out so much in compari
son to the well-done elements
that 1 was slightly disappointed
in As You Like It. But exposure
to Shakespeare never hurt any
one. 1 am inclined to believe that
hearing Touchstone parody Or
lando's poetry is worth the price
of a ticket.

enemy of Duke Frederick. Or
lando seeks refuge from Duke
Frederick in the forest with his
old servant, Adam. There he
meets Rosalind, dressed as the
boy Ganymede, who teaches him
to see love realistically and ends
his writing of dreadful verse.
Linda Morrissey, as Rosalind,
occasionally captures the play
ful wisdom of her character but,
more often, misses it. Her scenes
with Orlando (David Bryant),
never quite reach the peaks of
irony present in the text.

Bryant's role is a simpler one but
the lack of a strong Rosalind
obscures the evidence of Orlan
do's progress from an unnur
tured younger son to a gentle
man.
More royal
Celia (Ellen Adamson)
achieves a greater bearing of
royalty and control than any of
her relatives — including the
dukes. On occasion, however,
she and Rosalind speak so
quickly as to be unintelligible.
When comprehensible their ex
changes with Touchstone
(Stephen McFarland), are clever
and enjoyable.
McFarland plays his part well
as the ill-intentioned, mischiev
ous, and discerning fool. Jaques
(Doyne Mraz), tries to emulate
Touchstone but fails.
Touchstone is a successful fool
because of his incredible apathy
but Jacques is melancholy and
bitter. The character of Jacques is
difficult and evasive. Mraz cer
tainly conveys the bitterness of
Jacques but not his "most
humorous sadness."
Smaller but still delightful
parts were those of the insipid,
love-struck Silvius (S. Michael
Bowen); the sluttish, haughty
shepardess, Phebe (Valerie De
Jose); and Touchstone's undulat
ing country wench, Audrey (Ali

son Parker).
Some of my criticisms of the
play are not due to the acting but
the interpretation of characters
by director Leigh Sealy. Duke
Senior (Mark Moskowitz) too
jolly and callous for a man in
exile, for example. And, as men
tioned earlier, Jacques and
Rosalind never achieve the per
sonalities which Shakespeare
created.
Fluidity
Sealy, however, does an ad
mirable job in controlling the
movements and action on stage
and produces a fluidity of mo
tion which carries the play
quickly through each act.
The production is located in
Little Theatre, behind Memorial
Auditorium. The small theatre is
a warm and comfortable setting
for As You Like It. The set, by
William Eddelman, consists of
two raised platforms on either
side of the stage, and a
background of trees and flowers.
The stage floor, platforms, and
background are painted in the
blue and greens of the Arden
forest.
Although most of the play's
action occurs in the woods, the
attractive set adapts easily to the
court scenes as well. While a
single set can be boring and de
tracting, the lack of scene
changes and variability of Ed
delman's set give the production
a continuity of action.
The lighting design, by
Michael Ramsaur and Jonathan
Mills, contributed to the diver
sity of the set. Never blatant or
artificial, the subtle warning and
dimming of lights indicates
moods and time of day without
bombarding the audience with
obvious symbolism. Dimming
also accompanies exists so that
entrances always seem to be at a
new location.
Forest hues
The costumes, also designed
by William Eddelman, compli
ment his set perfectly. As the aci
ton of the play, and the charac
ters, move into the Arden forest
their attire becomes simpler and
they adopt the hues of the forest.
Costumer Barbara Cleveland
spares no expenditure of time
and money as the garments are
beautifully sewn with an abun

dance of rich velvets. Rather
than distracting one's attention
from the action of the play, the
costumes enhance.
The music, directed by Sarah
Mead, and performend by her
self, Kent Underwood and Dale
Herman, also enhanced As You
Like It. The recorder, cello, and
mandolin help in setting the
time, as well as making the
play's songs and wedding scene
more entertaining.
Underwood, Herman and
Mead also play for an interlude
of dancing by spirits of the
woods. While the dancing is not
done badly, Shakespeare in
cluded no mention of such a
scene in his play. Comic inter

ludes were often used in order to
alleviate the mood of a tragedy,
but this play is no tragedy. It
adds nothing to the production
but time and a lapse of con
tinuity. If a scene does not con
tribute then it derogates and I
must conclude that the choreog
raphical efforts of Susan Cashion
are wasted.
The flaws in the production
stand out so much in compari
son to the well-done elements
that 1 was slightly disappointed
in As You Like It. But exposure
to Shakespeare never hurt any
one. 1 am inclined to believe that
hearing Touchstone parody Or
lando's poetry is worth the price
of a ticket.

quickly as to be unintelligible.
When comprehensible their ex
changes with Touchstone
(Stephen McFarland), are clever
and enjoyable.
McFarland plays his part well
as the ill-intentioned, mischiev
ous, and discerning fool. Jaques
(Doyne Mraz), tries to emulate
Touchstone but fails.
Touchstone is a successful fool
because of his incredible apathy
but Jacques is melancholy and
bitter. The character of Jacques is
difficult and evasive. Mraz cer
tainly conveys the bitterness of
Jacques but not his "most
humorous sadness."
Smaller but still delightful
parts were those of the insipid,
love-struck Silvius (S. Michael
Bowen); the sluttish, haughty
shepardess, Phebe (Valerie De
Jose); and Touchstone's undulat
ing country wench, Audrey (Ali

son Parker).
Some of my criticisms of the
play are not due to the acting but
the interpretation of characters
by director Leigh Sealy. Duke
Senior (Mark Moskowitz) too
jolly and callous for a man in
exile, for example. And, as men
tioned earlier, Jacques and
Rosalind never achieve the per
sonalities which Shakespeare
created.
Fluidity
Sealy, however, does an ad
mirable job in controlling the
movements and action on stage
and produces a fluidity of mo
tion which carries the play
quickly through each act.
The production is located in
Little Theatre, behind Memorial
Auditorium. The small theatre is
a warm and comfortable setting
for As You Like It. The set, by
William Eddelman, consists of
two raised platforms on either
side of the stage, and a
background of trees and flowers.
The stage floor, platforms, and
background are painted in the
blue and greens of the Arden
forest.
Although most of the play's
action occurs in the woods, the
attractive set adapts easily to the
court scenes as well. While a
single set can be boring and de
tracting, the lack of scene
changes and variability of Ed
delman's set give the production
a continuity of action.
The lighting design, by
Michael Ramsaur and Jonathan
Mills, contributed to the diver
sity of the set. Never blatant or
artificial, the subtle warning and
dimming of lights indicates
moods and time of day without
bombarding the audience with
obvious symbolism. Dimming
also accompanies exists so that
entrances always seem to be at a
new location.
Forest hues
The costumes, also designed
by William Eddelman, compli
ment his set perfectly. As the aci
ton of the play, and the charac
ters, move into the Arden forest
their attire becomes simpler and
they adopt the hues of the forest.
Costumer Barbara Cleveland
spares no expenditure of time
and money as the garments are
beautifully sewn with an abun

dance of rich velvets. Rather
than distracting one's attention
from the action of the play, the
costumes enhance.
The music, directed by Sarah
Mead, and performend by her
self, Kent Underwood and Dale
Herman, also enhanced As You
Like It. The recorder, cello, and
mandolin help in setting the
time, as well as making the
play's songs and wedding scene
more entertaining.
Underwood, Herman and
Mead also play for an interlude
of dancing by spirits of the
woods. While the dancing is not
done badly, Shakespeare in
cluded no mention of such a
scene in his play. Comic inter

ludes were often used in order to
alleviate the mood of a tragedy,
but this play is no tragedy. It
adds nothing to the production
but time and a lapse of con
tinuity. If a scene does not con
tribute then it derogates and I
must conclude that the choreog
raphical efforts of Susan Cashion
are wasted.
The flaws in the production
stand out so much in compari
son to the well-done elements
that 1 was slightly disappointed
in As You Like It. But exposure
to Shakespeare never hurt any
one. 1 am inclined to believe that
hearing Touchstone parody Or
lando's poetry is worth the price
of a ticket.

Up a tree
The disguised Rosalind, played by Linda Morrissey, jests with
her true love, Orlando, played by David Bryant, in the drama
department production of Shakespeare's As You Like It.
The drama department is
commemorating Memorial
Hall's fortieth anniversary with a
production of William Shakes
peare's As You Like It. The pas
toral comedy is based on
Thomas Lodge's Roscilynde:
Euphues Golden Legacie, a
popular novel whose third edi
tion appeared in 1 598. The Bard
of Avon wrote his play between
that time and 1600.
The main character of As You
Like It is Rosalind, daughter of
the exiled Duke Senior. Duke
Frederick, the usurper and uncle
to Rosalind, banishes his niece
who flees to the forest of Arden
with her cousin, Celia, but not
before Rosalind falls in love with
Orlando. Orlando is the son of
the late Sir Roland De Bois, a
friend of Duke Senior but an
enemy of Duke Frederick. Or
lando seeks refuge from Duke
Frederick in the forest with his
old servant, Adam. There he
meets Rosalind, dressed as the
boy Ganymede, who teaches him
to see love realistically and ends
his writing of dreadful verse.
Linda Morrissey, as Rosalind,
occasionally captures the play
ful wisdom of her character but,
more often, misses it. Her scenes
with Orlando (David Bryant),
never quite reach the peaks of
irony present in the text.

Bryant's role is a simpler one but
the lack of a strong Rosalind
obscures the evidence of Orlan
do's progress from an unnur
tured younger son to a gentle
man.
More royal
Celia (Ellen Adamson)
achieves a greater bearing of
royalty and control than any of
her relatives — including the
dukes. On occasion, however,
she and Rosalind speak so
quickly as to be unintelligible.
When comprehensible their ex
changes with Touchstone
(Stephen McFarland), are clever
and enjoyable.

ous, and discerning fool. Jaques
