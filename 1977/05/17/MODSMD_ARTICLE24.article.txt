## Productions of Wilde, Wilder contrast 
### 
This past weekend I attended two opening
night performances of dorm productions.
Thursday evening I saw Eucalypto's The Im
portance of Being Earnest and on Friday
Cedro's The Skin of Our Teeth. The two
proved to be a study of contrast.
Oscar Wilde's enormously funny comedy
The Importance of Being Earnest had every
thing going for it. The situations and lines
are inherently funny. The play is a straight
forward drawing-room comedy which asks
nothing of the audience. Unfortunately for
the cast it did ask something of them.
The performance started off much too fast
and never did achieve the right pace. Many
lines were lost due to their over-rapid deliv
ery. The attempts at English accents also
hurt. In fact, through the first act the laughter
backstage far surpassed that of the audience.
Of course, the sparce attendance did not help
any in this respect.
The play is about "Bunburyism," which is
a game of duel identity. The plot revolves
around the double lives of Algernon and
Jack, played by Paul Krieg and kelley
Young. Both displayed potential, but just

could not quite pull off the parts. There were
moments when they captured the necessary
qualities but they failed to sustain them for
any length of time.
Gwendolyn, played by Mary Anderson,
came off well though underplayed. Excel
lent in smaller roles were James Tranquada
and Karl Kumli. The production picked up
markedly in the later acts, but by the time it
reached its stride the curtain had fallen.
In distinct contrast was Thornton Wilder's
The Skin of Our Teeth as presented by Cedro.
This play, written during WW 11, marked the
conquest of the modern theater by the ex
pressionist movement. It deals with a circu
lar theory of history as expressed by the av
erage family's struggle to survive. The story
takes the family through three ages â€” the ice
age, the flood, and a world war. All this is
conveyed to the audience by such dramatic
devices as actors stepping out of character
and the stage manager coming on stage to
explain the action. Director Paul Wintraub
managed to bring out all that Wilder had
intended.
The play demands much of both spec
tators and cast, but neither shirked the task.

The capacity audience accepted the drama
tic liberties well and the cast performed ex
cellently from curtain to curtain. Derek Pens
lar as Mr. Antrobus, the common man, deli
vered a superb performance. His style was
just right and reminded me of Henry Fonda
at times, seemingly condescending and un
derneath always in control.
His wife, played by Fatty Bowman, was
also particularly good. Her ability to employ
the proper invectives at the proper time
made her performance a wonderfully strong
one. Leslie Mintz as Sabina, upon whom
many key transitions depended, was unfor
tunately weak through the first half of the
play. by the last act she had reco
vered and turhed in a credible performance.
Outstanding in supporting roles were Terri
Robbins, Scott Magee, Bryan Furlong, David
Gale, Ellen Behrens, and Brad Craig.
The overall quality of the production was
on a high level and moved very smoothly. I
have to regard it as a standout among this
year's dorm 1 extend my har
diest congratulations to cast, crew, and par
ticularly director Weintraub for a job well
done.
