Congress approves tax cuts
Washington — Congress gave final approval
yesterday to a bill cutting taxes for 46 million
low- and middle-income couples or individuals
and simplifying tax returns for 95 per cent of
Americans.
The Senate approved t he bil 1 by voice vote. The
House vote was 383 to two with only Representa
tives Andy Jacobs (D-lnd.) and Charles Wiggins
(R-Calif.) voting against it.
The bill, stripped of the $50-per-person rebates
President Jimmy Carter once proposed to stimu
late the economy, now goes to the White House. It
would provide tax relief totaling $34.1 billion
over the next 28 months.
Most taxpayers affected by the change in the
standard deduction would see the results in
higher take-home pay after June 1.
For millions of taxpayers, an important section
of the bill would mean an easier job filing federal
income-tax returns each year. This simplification
provision would allow the bulk of individual
taxpayers to figure out their taxes with virtually
no mathematical computations.
By permanently raising the standard deduc
tion, the legislation would result in annual tax
cuts averaging $111 for 46 million who do not
itemize deductions. But the process of simplify
ing the standard deduction would mean a tax
increase averaging $52 a year for two million
single taxpayers.
Death penalty passes in Assembly
Sacramento — The death penalty in California
moved one step closer to being law yesterday,
scoring an Assembly victory without a vote to
spare after a debate full of religious overtones.
However, Sen. George Deukmejian (R-Long
Beach), the author of the bill, said afterward he

thought Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. could block it if
he really wanted to. A Brown aide disputed that
assessment.
The Senate, which has passed the bill once
already, is expected to concur in Assembly
amendments Thursday and send it to Brown's
desk. The Democratic governor has promised to
veto any death penalty bill as a matter ol consci
ence.
The same two-thirds majority will be needed to
override a veto. And Deukinejian told reporters
he thought the outcome of an override battle
would be up to the governor.
But Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, said in
an interview that Deukmejian was overstating
the governor's influence.
5-day mail delivery probable
Washington — You probably will pay higher
postage charges and receive mail only five days
per week by early next year, the Postal Service
said yesterday.
Postmaster General Benjamin Bailar said the
price of a stamp for first-class letters will rise
from the current 13 cents to at least 15 cents..ll
will be 16 cents if six-day delivery is maintained,
he warned.
With time allowed for commission delibera
tion, the higher rates would not take effect until
"the second quarter of calendar 1978" and the
reduced deliveries would not be in effect until
after the next Christmas mailing season, Bailar
said.
Bailar also said that the mail agency soon
would resume slowly closing rural post offices in
areas where it feels it could do so without hurting
service.
An internal Postal Service study released this
month said $490 million could be saved by clos

ing post offices in 17,000 of the 30,000 com
munities that have them now.
Portugal to receive Western aid
Lisbon, Portugal — Vice President Walter
Mondale met with top Portuguese leaders yes
terday and discussed plans for $700 million in
Western loans to Portugal, one of the poorest
nations in Europe.
After a 40-minute talk with Premier Mario
Soares, Mondale said there were no problems
between the two countries but there were some
"technical concerns" that needed quick resolu
tion.
Mondale did not mention specifics, but they
were believed to involve details of the loan,
which both U.S. and Portuguese officials con
sider essential if Lisbon's 10-month-old democ
racy is to survive.
The plan calls for the United States to provide
$300 million and urge other Western govern
ments to contribute the rest.
Mondale, who flies to Spain today, was visit
ing the Iberian Peninsula in a show of U.S. sup
port for the emerging democracies there.
Consumer agency delay criticized
Washington — Angry members of Congress
criticized the Consumer Product Safety Commis
sion yesterday for "inordinate delays" in reach
ing its decision to ban Tris, the flame retardant
used in children's sleepwear.
Studies over several years indicated that Tris,
which had been used to make children's sleep
wear meet federal flammability standards, can be
absorbed through the skin and left residues in the
tissue of test animals.
But no action was taken until the commission
issued its order on April 8 barring further sale of
Tris-treated children's sleepwear and ordering

manufacturers to repurchase unwashed gar
ments.
S. John Byington, head of the commission,
acknowledged that other products containing
Tris are still being sold. These include doll clo
thing, doll and adult wigs and automobile and
furniture upholstery.
He said all are being evaluated to see if they
present unreasonable risks to the public. He
noted that with all those products, there is con
siderably less skin contact than with sleepwear.
State court to review liquor laws
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court agreed yesterday to consider for the fourth
time the constitutionality of the state's controv
ersial 37-year-old minimum liquor price laws.
The previous three decisions — the last in 1969
— held the fair trade liquor price laws were valid.
But these rulings came prior to the repeal on Dec.
2, 1975 by Congress of a section of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act which permitted states to allow
fair trade contracts if they desired.
Four justices voted for granting the hearing
sought by Richard Corsetti and his wife, doing
business as Bob's Liquors of San Francisco.
The state's Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC)
Board had ordered Corsetti's license suspended
for 10 days after a state agent testified he bought
liquor at the store at a cut-rate price.
Faced with possible revocation of license, Cor
setti went to the ABC Appeal Board. That board
last Dec. 2 held the fair trade laws on liquor, wine
and beer "can no longer be justified."
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Strong winds decreas

mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in
the upper 50s and 60s.

Congress approves tax cuts
Washington — Congress gave final approval
yesterday to a bill cutting taxes for 46 million
low- and middle-income couples or individuals
and simplifying tax returns for 95 per cent of
Americans.
The Senate approved t he bil 1 by voice vote. The
House vote was 383 to two with only Representa
tives Andy Jacobs (D-lnd.) and Charles Wiggins
(R-Calif.) voting against it.
The bill, stripped of the $50-per-person rebates
President Jimmy Carter once proposed to stimu
late the economy, now goes to the White House. It
would provide tax relief totaling $34.1 billion
over the next 28 months.
Most taxpayers affected by the change in the
standard deduction would see the results in
higher take-home pay after June 1.
For millions of taxpayers, an important section
of the bill would mean an easier job filing federal
income-tax returns each year. This simplification
provision would allow the bulk of individual
taxpayers to figure out their taxes with virtually
no mathematical computations.
By permanently raising the standard deduc
tion, the legislation would result in annual tax
cuts averaging $111 for 46 million who do not
itemize deductions. But the process of simplify
ing the standard deduction would mean a tax
increase averaging $52 a year for two million
single taxpayers.
Death penalty passes in Assembly
Sacramento — The death penalty in California
moved one step closer to being law yesterday,
scoring an Assembly victory without a vote to
spare after a debate full of religious overtones.
However, Sen. George Deukmejian (R-Long
Beach), the author of the bill, said afterward he

thought Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. could block it if
he really wanted to. A Brown aide disputed that
assessment.
The Senate, which has passed the bill once
already, is expected to concur in Assembly
amendments Thursday and send it to Brown's
desk. The Democratic governor has promised to
veto any death penalty bill as a matter ol consci
ence.
The same two-thirds majority will be needed to
override a veto. And Deukinejian told reporters
he thought the outcome of an override battle
would be up to the governor.
But Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, said in
an interview that Deukmejian was overstating
the governor's influence.
5-day mail delivery probable
Washington — You probably will pay higher
postage charges and receive mail only five days
per week by early next year, the Postal Service
said yesterday.
Postmaster General Benjamin Bailar said the
price of a stamp for first-class letters will rise
from the current 13 cents to at least 15 cents..ll
will be 16 cents if six-day delivery is maintained,
he warned.
With time allowed for commission delibera
tion, the higher rates would not take effect until
"the second quarter of calendar 1978" and the
reduced deliveries would not be in effect until
after the next Christmas mailing season, Bailar
said.
Bailar also said that the mail agency soon
would resume slowly closing rural post offices in
areas where it feels it could do so without hurting
service.
An internal Postal Service study released this
month said $490 million could be saved by clos

ing post offices in 17,000 of the 30,000 com
munities that have them now.
Portugal to receive Western aid
Lisbon, Portugal — Vice President Walter
Mondale met with top Portuguese leaders yes
terday and discussed plans for $700 million in
Western loans to Portugal, one of the poorest
nations in Europe.
After a 40-minute talk with Premier Mario
Soares, Mondale said there were no problems
between the two countries but there were some
"technical concerns" that needed quick resolu
tion.
Mondale did not mention specifics, but they
were believed to involve details of the loan,
which both U.S. and Portuguese officials con
sider essential if Lisbon's 10-month-old democ
racy is to survive.
The plan calls for the United States to provide
$300 million and urge other Western govern
ments to contribute the rest.
Mondale, who flies to Spain today, was visit
ing the Iberian Peninsula in a show of U.S. sup
port for the emerging democracies there.
Consumer agency delay criticized
Washington — Angry members of Congress
criticized the Consumer Product Safety Commis
sion yesterday for "inordinate delays" in reach
ing its decision to ban Tris, the flame retardant
used in children's sleepwear.
Studies over several years indicated that Tris,
which had been used to make children's sleep
wear meet federal flammability standards, can be
absorbed through the skin and left residues in the
tissue of test animals.
But no action was taken until the commission
issued its order on April 8 barring further sale of
Tris-treated children's sleepwear and ordering

manufacturers to repurchase unwashed gar
ments.
S. John Byington, head of the commission,
acknowledged that other products containing
Tris are still being sold. These include doll clo
thing, doll and adult wigs and automobile and
furniture upholstery.
He said all are being evaluated to see if they
present unreasonable risks to the public. He
noted that with all those products, there is con
siderably less skin contact than with sleepwear.
State court to review liquor laws
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court agreed yesterday to consider for the fourth
time the constitutionality of the state's controv

The previous three decisions — the last in 1969
— held the fair trade liquor price laws were valid.
But these rulings came prior to the repeal on Dec.
2, 1975 by Congress of a section of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act which permitted states to allow
fair trade contracts if they desired.
Four justices voted for granting the hearing
sought by Richard Corsetti and his wife, doing
business as Bob's Liquors of San Francisco.
The state's Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC)
Board had ordered Corsetti's license suspended
for 10 days after a state agent testified he bought
liquor at the store at a cut-rate price.
Faced with possible revocation of license, Cor

last Dec. 2 held the fair trade laws on liquor, wine

sought by Richard Corsetti and his wife, doing
business as Bob's Liquors of San Francisco.
The state's Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC)
Board had ordered Corsetti's license suspended
for 10 days after a state agent testified he bought
liquor at the store at a cut-rate price.
Faced with possible revocation of license, Cor
setti went to the ABC Appeal Board. That board
last Dec. 2 held the fair trade laws on liquor, wine
and beer "can no longer be justified."
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Strong winds decreas

mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in

Congress approves tax cuts
Washington — Congress gave final approval
yesterday to a bill cutting taxes for 46 million
low- and middle-income couples or individuals
and simplifying tax returns for 95 per cent of
Americans.
The Senate approved t he bil 1 by voice vote. The
House vote was 383 to two with only Representa
tives Andy Jacobs (D-lnd.) and Charles Wiggins
(R-Calif.) voting against it.
The bill, stripped of the $50-per-person rebates
President Jimmy Carter once proposed to stimu
late the economy, now goes to the White House. It
would provide tax relief totaling $34.1 billion
over the next 28 months.
Most taxpayers affected by the change in the
standard deduction would see the results in
higher take-home pay after June 1.
For millions of taxpayers, an important section
of the bill would mean an easier job filing federal
income-tax returns each year. This simplification
provision would allow the bulk of individual
taxpayers to figure out their taxes with virtually
no mathematical computations.
By permanently raising the standard deduc
tion, the legislation would result in annual tax
cuts averaging $111 for 46 million who do not
itemize deductions. But the process of simplify
ing the standard deduction would mean a tax
increase averaging $52 a year for two million
single taxpayers.
Death penalty passes in Assembly
Sacramento — The death penalty in California
moved one step closer to being law yesterday,
scoring an Assembly victory without a vote to
spare after a debate full of religious overtones.
However, Sen. George Deukmejian (R-Long
Beach), the author of the bill, said afterward he

thought Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. could block it if
he really wanted to. A Brown aide disputed that
assessment.
The Senate, which has passed the bill once
already, is expected to concur in Assembly
amendments Thursday and send it to Brown's
desk. The Democratic governor has promised to
veto any death penalty bill as a matter ol consci
ence.
The same two-thirds majority will be needed to
override a veto. And Deukinejian told reporters
he thought the outcome of an override battle
would be up to the governor.
But Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, said in
an interview that Deukmejian was overstating
the governor's influence.
5-day mail delivery probable
Washington — You probably will pay higher
postage charges and receive mail only five days
per week by early next year, the Postal Service
said yesterday.
Postmaster General Benjamin Bailar said the
price of a stamp for first-class letters will rise
from the current 13 cents to at least 15 cents..ll
will be 16 cents if six-day delivery is maintained,
he warned.
With time allowed for commission delibera
tion, the higher rates would not take effect until
"the second quarter of calendar 1978" and the
reduced deliveries would not be in effect until
after the next Christmas mailing season, Bailar
said.
Bailar also said that the mail agency soon
would resume slowly closing rural post offices in
areas where it feels it could do so without hurting
service.
An internal Postal Service study released this
month said $490 million could be saved by clos

ing post offices in 17,000 of the 30,000 com
munities that have them now.
Portugal to receive Western aid
Lisbon, Portugal — Vice President Walter
Mondale met with top Portuguese leaders yes
terday and discussed plans for $700 million in
Western loans to Portugal, one of the poorest
nations in Europe.
After a 40-minute talk with Premier Mario
Soares, Mondale said there were no problems
between the two countries but there were some
"technical concerns" that needed quick resolu
tion.
Mondale did not mention specifics, but they
were believed to involve details of the loan,
which both U.S. and Portuguese officials con
sider essential if Lisbon's 10-month-old democ
racy is to survive.
The plan calls for the United States to provide
$300 million and urge other Western govern
ments to contribute the rest.
Mondale, who flies to Spain today, was visit
ing the Iberian Peninsula in a show of U.S. sup
port for the emerging democracies there.
Consumer agency delay criticized
Washington — Angry members of Congress
criticized the Consumer Product Safety Commis
sion yesterday for "inordinate delays" in reach
ing its decision to ban Tris, the flame retardant
used in children's sleepwear.
Studies over several years indicated that Tris,
which had been used to make children's sleep
wear meet federal flammability standards, can be
absorbed through the skin and left residues in the
tissue of test animals.
But no action was taken until the commission
issued its order on April 8 barring further sale of
Tris-treated children's sleepwear and ordering

manufacturers to repurchase unwashed gar
ments.
S. John Byington, head of the commission,
acknowledged that other products containing
Tris are still being sold. These include doll clo
thing, doll and adult wigs and automobile and
furniture upholstery.
He said all are being evaluated to see if they
present unreasonable risks to the public. He
noted that with all those products, there is con
siderably less skin contact than with sleepwear.
State court to review liquor laws
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court agreed yesterday to consider for the fourth
time the constitutionality of the state's controv
ersial 37-year-old minimum liquor price laws.
The previous three decisions — the last in 1969
— held the fair trade liquor price laws were valid.
But these rulings came prior to the repeal on Dec.
2, 1975 by Congress of a section of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act which permitted states to allow
fair trade contracts if they desired.
Four justices voted for granting the hearing
