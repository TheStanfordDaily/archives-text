# First time in history
## Provost changes grade 
### Randy David 
For the first time in University history an administrator
has overruled a professor and changed an undergraduate's
grade.
Provost William Miller said he has changed a grade
Chemistry Prof. William Bonner had given to sophomore
Peter Cohen from a B to an A-. After a IU-month procedure,
the case was finally resolved when Bonner chose not to
appeal Miller's decision, according to Miller.
Until 1972, professors' grade decisions were final, ac
cording to Ombudsman John Coheen. However, in that
year, an academic grievance procedure was established,
with a chain of appeals from department chairmen up to the
president, he said.
Cohen followed the procedure through to the provost. It
was not necessary for him to go up to the president.
Commenting on the process, Cohen said. "There is defi

nitely something wrong with the grievance procedure if it
takes 13 months. The way it is set up is ridiculous."
According to Cohen, his grievance originates from an
answer being overlooked on his Chemistry 33 final during
autumn quarter last year. If the answer had been graded,
said Cohen, he would have received an A in the course.
A teaching assistant in the class awarded Cohen six
[joints for the overlooked question as well as three addi
tional points on other questions, said Cohen. Because the
additional points were added, Bonner chose to regrade the
test and took off 19 points, according to Cohen.
Cohen then initiated the grievance procedure. The pro
cedure led him to talk with Chemistry Department ("hair
