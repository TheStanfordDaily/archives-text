All students who were guaranteed
housing for next year and who agreed
to accept any campus residence were
assigned to campus housing, accord
ing to the new round one results re
leased yesterday.
Of 3567 students entering the draw,
2690, or 75 per cent, were assigned to a
residence whileBss students, or 24 per
cent, remained unassigned. Seven
spaces were unfilled and 22 students
were assigned off campus.
The cutoff number for students not
holding housing guarantees for next
year is 163 for men and 2462 for wo
men.
The large discrepancy between men
and women "happens every year,"
said Phil Curry, administrative assis
tant to the dean of student affairs, "due
to the fraternity system where many
men are holding two spaces at once.
Many people who have drawn in the
first round are rushing a fraternity and
if they pledge will drop out of the
draw."
"Certainly the men's cutoff number
will move up into the vicinity of the
women's after the second round," said
Curry. The cut off numbers are com
parable to those in past years, he said,
emphasizing that "the percentage of
students being assigned has remained
constant over the past several years."
The computer troubles which
necessitated reruning the first round
assignments on the computer turned
out to be "a very localized problem
i nvolvi ng seven people 1 vho were dep
rived of priorities they had rightfully
earned," Curry explained.
Changes between the two first round
assignments are confined to specific
ranges, said Curry, and the differences
between the two assignments are not
large. Curry said the number of stu

dents who will receive a different as
signment under the new results will be
"relatively few" but he said he did not
know the precise number.
Androgyny House filled in the first
round, thereby meeting the minimum
requirement for its existence next year,
said Curry.
The cutoff numbers for entering An
drogyny House were 2507 for women
and 340(3 for men, while the cutoff
numbers for the French house were
4202 for women and 4382 for men. Cut
-1594 for women, but 4742 for men.
For both men and women. 558
Mayfield proved the most difficult
house to draw into. Men needed 88 or
lower and women needed 125. Theta
Chi, Lathrop, Alpha Sig, American
Studies and Mirrilees proved to be the
other most difficult houses for women
