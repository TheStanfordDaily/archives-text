# Lights off for lunch tomorrow
## 
### Will Nixon 
Lights all over campus will be
doused tomorrow at noon as part of an
"off it" hour project sponsored by a
SWOPSI class on energy conservation
as an energy resource.
"The concept behind the project is
to turn off all unnecessary lights in
classrooms, hallways, offices and liath
rooms," said Frank Jakob, a student
in the class. Other "unnecessary elec
trical equipment such as fans, air con
ditioners, copy machines and coffee
machines" should also be shut off, he
said.
The goal of the "off it" hour is to
reduce electricity usage for the hour by
10 per cent. The usage will be moni
tored by a computer in the central
steam plant, which keeps constant
track of the electricity output from the
main plant here, according to energy
office manager consultant Karl
Johnson.
Members of the SWOPSI class are
planning to conduct a phonathon to
morrow morning to remind all de
partments about the "off it" hour and
to ask them to turn off unnecessary
lights.
Volunteers will meet in the SWOPSI
office tomorrow at 11:45 a.m. to or
ganize patrolling of the campus during
the "off it" hour to turn off excess
lights.
Johnson, who teaches the SWOPSI
class, has invited all persons in
terested to help with the patrolling.
