# Journalist evaluates news media
## 
### Harry Killas 
"Broadcast journalism is better
than ever. And it's terrible."
So proclaims Ben Bagdikian, a
freelance writer, outspoken critic of
journalism and visiting communi
cation lecturer bere.
"Broadcasting is a marginal im
itation of the print media." he says
"they ride piggy-hack on the local
print media."
Although Bagdikian distin
guishes between the quality of local
and national news, he points out
that local stations report the news
second-hand reading local papers
for much of their information.
"Local TV is a disgrace."
Bagdikian has been at the center
of controversy during many of his
years in journalism. In the early
19505, he was sued for libel after
calling a wealthy backer of the
American Communist party a
"sophisticated fascist." Bagdikian
says he rescinded the word
"sophisticated" and won the case.
Since then he has edited for The
Saturday Evening Post and the
Washington Post, served on the sc
reening panel for the National En
dowment for the Humanities and
on the Social Science Research
Council, written five books and re
ceived a Peabody. a Pulitzer and
several university awards.
Teaching offer
Last year. Bagdikian and his wife,
a freelance writer-photographer,
moved to the Bav'Area. Communi
cation Prof. William Rivers asked
Bagdikian to teach a class on inde
pth reporting.
Bagdikian now freelances, con
tributing to such publications as
Harper's, Atlantic and New Repub
lic. He describes himself as "porta
ble." "You work harder for yourself
than you would by working for 'the
system.' "

In the March Atlantic Monthly.
Bagdikian explores college jour
nalism programs as well as the re
cent radical increase in the number
of people entering journalism.
The recent trend for more jour
nalism majors "began in the
19605." he says. "There was a great
concern for changing society. Two
fields were perceived by the stu
dents where they could take an ac
tive part in changing society: law
and journalism." Woodward and
Bernstein also gave this rise a boost,
he says.
Although some aspiring jour
nalists are involved with changing
society, many want the security of
job-oriented training, says Bagdi
kian: still others seek glamour.
'Bullshit'
"They think it's easy." he com
ments, "and many schools are
guilty of promoting the glamour.
They print brochures about how
you'll meet presidents and con
gressmen . . . It's a pile of bullshit."
In the 19705, Bagdikian says, he
perceives "a less evident concern
with social issues than there was
10, or even five to six years ago.
Although there are many very con
cerned students, many more are
concerned with jobs." He attributes
this concern partly to the present
economic situation, saying. "Stu
dents are a reflection of the society
they came out of."
According to Bagdikian, "Jour
nalists are better trained than ever
before . . . An increase in the
number of people with a middle
class background means that the
journalists are more profes
sionalized. which is good, and have
better pay, which is also good."
But people tend naturally to as
sociate with people from the same
social and economic background,
he says. "Journalists are now

sophisticated enough to under
stand the power structure, and con
centrate more on that." he says,
thereby losing touch with other
groups.
Narrow tunnel
The academic track from high
school to college is partly to blame
for this loss of contact, says Bagdi
kian. To journalists in particular,
the track constitutes a dangerous
narrow tunnel, he says. Rather than
using college for vocation training,
he says, "students should use the
time in college to develop their in
tellectual and social perception. It's
the only time to do it."
According to Bagdikian, anyone

should be able to learn basic jour
nalistic skills in a year. While con
demning most undergraduate jour
nal ist trai ni ng programs, he says he
admires the UC-Berkeley set-up:
"Berkeley phased out the under
grad journalism degree." Only
non-majors are eligible for a
graduate degree.
Hagdikian reports that editors are
appalled to find new reporters who
can't write or spell.
"The problems of writing and
spelling are real, but the causes
have been exaggerated." he says.
"Forty or 50 years ago, the golden
age of the basics, those who were
educated were the elite. Lately
we've put into practice what we've

always pretended. We are testing
people who we've never tested be
fore."
People who aren't exposed to
standard English are being sent
through school, he says. Bagdikian
says he regards this as a social and
national problem and that a "na
tional commitment" is necessary to
equip every American with the in
tellectual tools for society.
Myth
The notion that there is an excess
of investigative reporting is a myth,
says Bagdikian. "1 challenge any
one to look at one week's issue of
papers of one county and measure
the per cent of investigative report
ing .. . and then announce there's
an excess."
The duty of investigative report
ing, according to Bagdikian, is to
"report the pressing critical issues
of local areascompetentiy . . .There
is more investigative journalism
than there used to be, but there are
just as many unresolved commun
ity problems."
Although journalists want to do a
lot of investigative reporting, it's
usually too expensive and trouble
some, says Bagdikian. First, a good
writer must be used for a long time
for one story. Second, many news
papers have "a tradition of not rock
ing the boat in the community," he
says.
But Bagdikian argues that a
choice doesn't need to be made be
tween investigative or straight re
porting. With their average 20 per
cent profits, papers could expand
staff and cover more community
events, he asserts.
Newspaper monopolies
Bagdikian says he is also dis
turbed by the growing power of
newspaper monopolies. "The tax
laws, the failure of the Department
of justice to apply anti-trust laws

and the corporate ethic in the coun
try as a whole â€” make newspapers
the same as steel and auto conglom
erates," he says.
"But newspapers should be free
enterprise," he adds. "They should
put their comfortable profits into
covering communities more com
pletely."
Newspaper circulation has fallen
drastically in recent years due, in
part, to television and, to a lesser
extent, the economic situation,
Bagdikian comments. "Meanwhile
the newspapers have shown spec
tacular profits," he adds with some
regret.
"We are seeing this generation of
people grown up now." says Bag
dikian. "They think they no longer
'need' newspapers." But they are
mistaken, he says, because "people
do need newspapers to behave in
telligently in framing their soci
ety."
Advice
To the aspiring journalist. Bagdi
kian offers the following advice:
"Read a lot. Read really good
writers. Write a lot. . . The success
ful journalist of the future must
write well.
"Live a lot. (iet to know many
types of people. My ideal prescrip
tion is to get out of the academic rat
race and have a one-year cross
cultural experience where you do
something with people from
another background ... A social
experience will make you more
sensitive.
"And after you've done thai, get
an education. And study something
you're really interested in ... It's
important to be interested and ex
cited by life."
Spend two years on a good paper
in a medium-small community, he
says, "then shoot for the best job on
a big paper."

Ben Bagdikian
"Broadcast journalism is better
than ever. And it's terrible."
So proclaims Ben Bagdikian, a
freelance writer, outspoken critic of
journalism and visiting communi
cation lecturer bere.
"Broadcasting is a marginal im
itation of the print media." he says
"they ride piggy-hack on the local
print media."
Although Bagdikian distin
guishes between the quality of local
and national news, he points out
that local stations report the news
second-hand reading local papers
for much of their information.
"Local TV is a disgrace."
Bagdikian has been at the center
of controversy during many of his
years in journalism. In the early
19505, he was sued for libel after
calling a wealthy backer of the
American Communist party a
"sophisticated fascist." Bagdikian
says he rescinded the word
"sophisticated" and won the case.
Since then he has edited for The
Saturday Evening Post and the
Washington Post, served on the sc
reening panel for the National En
dowment for the Humanities and
on the Social Science Research
Council, written five books and re
ceived a Peabody. a Pulitzer and
several university awards.
Teaching offer
Last year. Bagdikian and his wife,
a freelance writer-photographer,
moved to the Bav'Area. Communi
cation Prof. William Rivers asked
Bagdikian to teach a class on inde
pth reporting.
Bagdikian now freelances, con
tributing to such publications as
Harper's, Atlantic and New Repub
lic. He describes himself as "porta
ble." "You work harder for yourself
than you would by working for 'the
system.' "

In the March Atlantic Monthly.
Bagdikian explores college jour
nalism programs as well as the re
cent radical increase in the number
of people entering journalism.
The recent trend for more jour
nalism majors "began in the
19605." he says. "There was a great
concern for changing society. Two
fields were perceived by the stu
dents where they could take an ac
tive part in changing society: law
and journalism." Woodward and
Bernstein also gave this rise a boost,
he says.
Although some aspiring jour
nalists are involved with changing
society, many want the security of
job-oriented training, says Bagdi
kian: still others seek glamour.
'Bullshit'
"They think it's easy." he com
ments, "and many schools are
guilty of promoting the glamour.
They print brochures about how
you'll meet presidents and con
gressmen . . . It's a pile of bullshit."
In the 19705, Bagdikian says, he
perceives "a less evident concern
with social issues than there was
10, or even five to six years ago.
Although there are many very con
cerned students, many more are
concerned with jobs." He attributes
this concern partly to the present
economic situation, saying. "Stu
dents are a reflection of the society
they came out of."
According to Bagdikian, "Jour
nalists are better trained than ever
before . . . An increase in the
number of people with a middle
class background means that the
journalists are more profes
sionalized. which is good, and have
better pay, which is also good."
But people tend naturally to as
sociate with people from the same
social and economic background,
he says. "Journalists are now

sophisticated enough to under
stand the power structure, and con
centrate more on that." he says,
thereby losing touch with other
groups.
Narrow tunnel
The academic track from high
school to college is partly to blame
for this loss of contact, says Bagdi
kian. To journalists in particular,
the track constitutes a dangerous
narrow tunnel, he says. Rather than
using college for vocation training,
he says, "students should use the
time in college to develop their in
tellectual and social perception. It's
the only time to do it."
According to Bagdikian, anyone

should be able to learn basic jour
nalistic skills in a year. While con
demning most undergraduate jour
nal ist trai ni ng programs, he says he
admires the UC-Berkeley set-up:
"Berkeley phased out the under
grad journalism degree." Only
non-majors are eligible for a
graduate degree.
Hagdikian reports that editors are
appalled to find new reporters who
can't write or spell.
"The problems of writing and
spelling are real, but the causes
have been exaggerated." he says.
"Forty or 50 years ago, the golden
age of the basics, those who were
educated were the elite. Lately
we've put into practice what we've

always pretended. We are testing
people who we've never tested be
fore."
People who aren't exposed to
standard English are being sent
through school, he says. Bagdikian
says he regards this as a social and
national problem and that a "na
tional commitment" is necessary to
equip every American with the in
tellectual tools for society.
Myth
The notion that there is an excess
of investigative reporting is a myth,
says Bagdikian. "1 challenge any
one to look at one week's issue of
papers of one county and measure
the per cent of investigative report
ing .. . and then announce there's
an excess."
The duty of investigative report
ing, according to Bagdikian, is to
"report the pressing critical issues
of local areascompetentiy . . .There
is more investigative journalism
than there used to be, but there are
just as many unresolved commun
ity problems."
Although journalists want to do a
lot of investigative reporting, it's
usually too expensive and trouble
some, says Bagdikian. First, a good
writer must be used for a long time
for one story. Second, many news
papers have "a tradition of not rock
ing the boat in the community," he
says.
But Bagdikian argues that a
choice doesn't need to be made be
tween investigative or straight re
porting. With their average 20 per
cent profits, papers could expand
staff and cover more community
events, he asserts.
Newspaper monopolies
Bagdikian says he is also dis
turbed by the growing power of
newspaper monopolies. "The tax
laws, the failure of the Department
of justice to apply anti-trust laws

and the corporate ethic in the coun
try as a whole â€” make newspapers
the same as steel and auto conglom
erates," he says.
"But newspapers should be free
enterprise," he adds. "They should
put their comfortable profits into
covering communities more com
pletely."
Newspaper circulation has fallen
drastically in recent years due, in
part, to television and, to a lesser
extent, the economic situation,
Bagdikian comments. "Meanwhile
the newspapers have shown spec
tacular profits," he adds with some
regret.
"We are seeing this generation of
people grown up now." says Bag
dikian. "They think they no longer
'need' newspapers." But they are
mistaken, he says, because "people
do need newspapers to behave in
telligently in framing their soci
ety."
Advice
To the aspiring journalist. Bagdi
kian offers the following advice:
"Read a lot. Read really good
writers. Write a lot. . . The success

write well.
"Live a lot. (iet to know many
types of people. My ideal prescrip
tion is to get out of the academic rat
race and have a one-year cross
cultural experience where you do
something with people from
another background ... A social

"Broadcast journalism is better
than ever. And it's terrible."
So proclaims Ben Bagdikian, a
freelance writer, outspoken critic of
journalism and visiting communi
cation lecturer bere.
"Broadcasting is a marginal im
itation of the print media." he says
"they ride piggy-hack on the local
print media."
Although Bagdikian distin
guishes between the quality of local
and national news, he points out
that local stations report the news
second-hand reading local papers
for much of their information.
"Local TV is a disgrace."
Bagdikian has been at the center
of controversy during many of his
years in journalism. In the early
19505, he was sued for libel after
calling a wealthy backer of the
American Communist party a
"sophisticated fascist." Bagdikian
says he rescinded the word
"sophisticated" and won the case.
Since then he has edited for The
Saturday Evening Post and the
Washington Post, served on the sc
reening panel for the National En
dowment for the Humanities and
on the Social Science Research
Council, written five books and re
ceived a Peabody. a Pulitzer and
several university awards.
Teaching offer
Last year. Bagdikian and his wife,
a freelance writer-photographer,
moved to the Bav'Area. Communi
cation Prof. William Rivers asked
Bagdikian to teach a class on inde
pth reporting.
Bagdikian now freelances, con
tributing to such publications as
Harper's, Atlantic and New Repub
lic. He describes himself as "porta
ble." "You work harder for yourself
than you would by working for 'the
system.' "

In the March Atlantic Monthly.
Bagdikian explores college jour
nalism programs as well as the re
cent radical increase in the number
of people entering journalism.
The recent trend for more jour
nalism majors "began in the
19605." he says. "There was a great
concern for changing society. Two
fields were perceived by the stu
dents where they could take an ac
tive part in changing society: law
and journalism." Woodward and
Bernstein also gave this rise a boost,
he says.
Although some aspiring jour
nalists are involved with changing
society, many want the security of
job-oriented training, says Bagdi
kian: still others seek glamour.
'Bullshit'
"They think it's easy." he com
ments, "and many schools are
guilty of promoting the glamour.
They print brochures about how
you'll meet presidents and con
gressmen . . . It's a pile of bullshit."
In the 19705, Bagdikian says, he
perceives "a less evident concern
with social issues than there was
10, or even five to six years ago.
Although there are many very con
cerned students, many more are
concerned with jobs." He attributes
this concern partly to the present
economic situation, saying. "Stu
dents are a reflection of the society
they came out of."
According to Bagdikian, "Jour
nalists are better trained than ever
before . . . An increase in the
number of people with a middle
class background means that the
journalists are more profes
sionalized. which is good, and have
better pay, which is also good."
But people tend naturally to as
sociate with people from the same
social and economic background,
he says. "Journalists are now

sophisticated enough to under
stand the power structure, and con
centrate more on that." he says,
thereby losing touch with other
groups.
Narrow tunnel
The academic track from high
school to college is partly to blame
for this loss of contact, says Bagdi
kian. To journalists in particular,
the track constitutes a dangerous
narrow tunnel, he says. Rather than
using college for vocation training,
he says, "students should use the
time in college to develop their in
tellectual and social perception. It's
the only time to do it."
According to Bagdikian, anyone

should be able to learn basic jour
nalistic skills in a year. While con
demning most undergraduate jour
nal ist trai ni ng programs, he says he
admires the UC-Berkeley set-up:
"Berkeley phased out the under
grad journalism degree." Only
non-majors are eligible for a
graduate degree.
Hagdikian reports that editors are
appalled to find new reporters who
can't write or spell.
"The problems of writing and
spelling are real, but the causes
have been exaggerated." he says.
"Forty or 50 years ago, the golden
age of the basics, those who were
educated were the elite. Lately
we've put into practice what we've

always pretended. We are testing
people who we've never tested be
fore."
People who aren't exposed to
standard English are being sent
through school, he says. Bagdikian
says he regards this as a social and
national problem and that a "na
tional commitment" is necessary to
equip every American with the in
tellectual tools for society.
Myth
The notion that there is an excess
of investigative reporting is a myth,
says Bagdikian. "1 challenge any
one to look at one week's issue of
papers of one county and measure
the per cent of investigative report
ing .. . and then announce there's
an excess."
The duty of investigative report
ing, according to Bagdikian, is to
"report the pressing critical issues
of local areascompetentiy . . .There
is more investigative journalism
than there used to be, but there are
just as many unresolved commun
ity problems."
Although journalists want to do a
lot of investigative reporting, it's
usually too expensive and trouble
some, says Bagdikian. First, a good
writer must be used for a long time
for one story. Second, many news
papers have "a tradition of not rock
ing the boat in the community," he
says.
But Bagdikian argues that a
choice doesn't need to be made be
tween investigative or straight re
porting. With their average 20 per
cent profits, papers could expand
staff and cover more community
events, he asserts.
Newspaper monopolies
Bagdikian says he is also dis
turbed by the growing power of
newspaper monopolies. "The tax
laws, the failure of the Department
of justice to apply anti-trust laws

and the corporate ethic in the coun
try as a whole â€” make newspapers
the same as steel and auto conglom
erates," he says.
"But newspapers should be free
enterprise," he adds. "They should
put their comfortable profits into
covering communities more com
pletely."
Newspaper circulation has fallen
drastically in recent years due, in
part, to television and, to a lesser
extent, the economic situation,
Bagdikian comments. "Meanwhile
the newspapers have shown spec
tacular profits," he adds with some
regret.
"We are seeing this generation of
people grown up now." says Bag
dikian. "They think they no longer
'need' newspapers." But they are
mistaken, he says, because "people
do need newspapers to behave in
telligently in framing their soci
ety."

Ben Bagdikian
"Broadcast journalism is better
than ever. And it's terrible."
So proclaims Ben Bagdikian, a
freelance writer, outspoken critic of
journalism and visiting communi
cation lecturer bere.
"Broadcasting is a marginal im
itation of the print media." he says
"they ride piggy-hack on the local
print media."
Although Bagdikian distin
guishes between the quality of local
and national news, he points out
that local stations report the news
second-hand reading local papers
for much of their information.
"Local TV is a disgrace."
Bagdikian has been at the center
of controversy during many of his
years in journalism. In the early
19505, he was sued for libel after
calling a wealthy backer of the
American Communist party a
"sophisticated fascist." Bagdikian
says he rescinded the word
"sophisticated" and won the case.
Since then he has edited for The
Saturday Evening Post and the
Washington Post, served on the sc
reening panel for the National En
dowment for the Humanities and
on the Social Science Research
Council, written five books and re
ceived a Peabody. a Pulitzer and
several university awards.
Teaching offer
Last year. Bagdikian and his wife,
a freelance writer-photographer,
moved to the Bav'Area. Communi
cation Prof. William Rivers asked
Bagdikian to teach a class on inde
pth reporting.
Bagdikian now freelances, con
tributing to such publications as
Harper's, Atlantic and New Repub
lic. He describes himself as "porta
ble." "You work harder for yourself
than you would by working for 'the
system.' "

In the March Atlantic Monthly.
Bagdikian explores college jour
nalism programs as well as the re
cent radical increase in the number
of people entering journalism.
The recent trend for more jour
nalism majors "began in the
19605." he says. "There was a great
concern for changing society. Two
fields were perceived by the stu
dents where they could take an ac
tive part in changing society: law
and journalism." Woodward and
Bernstein also gave this rise a boost,
he says.
Although some aspiring jour
nalists are involved with changing
society, many want the security of
job-oriented training, says Bagdi
kian: still others seek glamour.
'Bullshit'
"They think it's easy." he com
ments, "and many schools are
guilty of promoting the glamour.
They print brochures about how
you'll meet presidents and con
gressmen . . . It's a pile of bullshit."
In the 19705, Bagdikian says, he
perceives "a less evident concern
with social issues than there was
10, or even five to six years ago.
Although there are many very con
cerned students, many more are
concerned with jobs." He attributes
this concern partly to the present
economic situation, saying. "Stu
dents are a reflection of the society
they came out of."
According to Bagdikian, "Jour
nalists are better trained than ever
before . . . An increase in the
number of people with a middle
class background means that the
journalists are more profes
sionalized. which is good, and have
better pay, which is also good."
But people tend naturally to as
sociate with people from the same
social and economic background,
he says. "Journalists are now

sophisticated enough to under
stand the power structure, and con
centrate more on that." he says,
thereby losing touch with other
groups.
Narrow tunnel
The academic track from high
school to college is partly to blame
for this loss of contact, says Bagdi
kian. To journalists in particular,
the track constitutes a dangerous
narrow tunnel, he says. Rather than
using college for vocation training,
he says, "students should use the
time in college to develop their in
tellectual and social perception. It's
the only time to do it."
According to Bagdikian, anyone

should be able to learn basic jour
nalistic skills in a year. While con
demning most undergraduate jour
nal ist trai ni ng programs, he says he
admires the UC-Berkeley set-up:
"Berkeley phased out the under
grad journalism degree." Only
non-majors are eligible for a
graduate degree.
Hagdikian reports that editors are
appalled to find new reporters who
can't write or spell.
"The problems of writing and
spelling are real, but the causes
have been exaggerated." he says.
"Forty or 50 years ago, the golden
age of the basics, those who were
educated were the elite. Lately
we've put into practice what we've

always pretended. We are testing
people who we've never tested be
fore."
People who aren't exposed to
standard English are being sent
through school, he says. Bagdikian
says he regards this as a social and
national problem and that a "na
tional commitment" is necessary to
equip every American with the in
tellectual tools for society.
Myth
The notion that there is an excess
of investigative reporting is a myth,
says Bagdikian. "1 challenge any
one to look at one week's issue of
papers of one county and measure
the per cent of investigative report
ing .. . and then announce there's
an excess."
The duty of investigative report
ing, according to Bagdikian, is to
"report the pressing critical issues
of local areascompetentiy . . .There
is more investigative journalism
than there used to be, but there are
just as many unresolved commun
ity problems."
Although journalists want to do a
lot of investigative reporting, it's
usually too expensive and trouble
some, says Bagdikian. First, a good
writer must be used for a long time
for one story. Second, many news
papers have "a tradition of not rock
ing the boat in the community," he
says.
But Bagdikian argues that a
choice doesn't need to be made be
tween investigative or straight re
porting. With their average 20 per
cent profits, papers could expand
staff and cover more community
events, he asserts.
Newspaper monopolies
Bagdikian says he is also dis
turbed by the growing power of
newspaper monopolies. "The tax
laws, the failure of the Department
of justice to apply anti-trust laws

and the corporate ethic in the coun
try as a whole â€” make newspapers
the same as steel and auto conglom
erates," he says.
"But newspapers should be free
enterprise," he adds. "They should
put their comfortable profits into
covering communities more com
pletely."
Newspaper circulation has fallen
drastically in recent years due, in
part, to television and, to a lesser
extent, the economic situation,
Bagdikian comments. "Meanwhile
the newspapers have shown spec
tacular profits," he adds with some
regret.
"We are seeing this generation of
people grown up now." says Bag
dikian. "They think they no longer
'need' newspapers." But they are
mistaken, he says, because "people
do need newspapers to behave in
telligently in framing their soci
ety."
