## Course evaluations 
### 
We applaud the Faculty Senate's
unanimous support for the recommenda
tion of the ASSU Task Force on Tenure
and Teaching Quality that courses be
evaluated each time they are offered.
In the past, absence of such evaluations
has made it almost impossible for teach
ing ability to be used as a major factor in
tenure decisions.
It is our hope that, with these evalua
tions, tenure committees will be able to
take more than the ability to research and
write into consideration when evaluating

professors.
President Richard Lyman's support for
the recommendation was also
heartwarming. With the agreement of the
Faculty Senate, the student government
and the administration, problems of im
plementing the program should be
minimized.
Clearly, research and writing are vital
to a university. But with the new course
evaluation system, professors' ability in
side the classroom can take its rightful
place alongside these two considerations
in faculty appointments.
