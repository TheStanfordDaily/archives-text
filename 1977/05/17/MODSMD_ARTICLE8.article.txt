# Response to Lyman
## 
### 
Chris Coleman

As one of the representatives
for the Protesters at last Mon
day's sit-in, I feel that President
Richard Lyman's statements
(Daily, May 13) demand some
clarification and response.
First, Lyman quoted me as say
ing, during negotiations over
SCRIP'S demands, "I've got 400
people here who came to be ar
rested." No statement of this sort
was made. Attributing such a
statement to a SCRIP spokesper
son represents an attack on both
our commitment to the issue of
Stanford's complicity in apar
theid and SCRIP's democratic
organization.
I told Lyman "there are" (not
"I've got") "300-400 protesters
in the building." I further stated
that I would take the trustees' re
sponse and all of his (Lyman's)
feelings back to the group, but
"my sense of the group tells me
that the trustees' response would
not be acceptable."
We did not simply come to be
arrested, as Lyman claims. Civil
disobedience is not a game and
people do not risk their educa
tional and professional careers

lightly. The decision to risk ar
rest was made by the group at
large after extensive debate, in a
final vote at approximately 6
p.m.
Our decision to commit a
non-violent act of civil disobedi
ence was preceeded by extraor
dinary efforts in the weeks be
fore the sit-in. SCRIP gathered
JOOO petition signatures, can
vassed campus dormitories re
peatedly, screened the South Af
rican documentary "Last Grave
at Dimbaza" over 40 times, pub
lished more than a dozen edito
rials in the Daily, collected en
dorsements from 20 campus or
ganizations, held two issue
related forums, sent a 30-page
position paper to the trustees,
organized a two-day fast and
vigil, and drew 700 students to a
May 3 rally, at which Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig promised that
Lyman would communicate our
concerns to the Board of Trus
tees. Dr. Peter Bing, chairman of
the Board of Trustees, was also
informed on several occasions of
our concerns.

The subsequent behavior of
the trustees forces us to assume
that our positions were never
made apparent to them, or that
they consciously chose to ignore
us. It is not the trustees, but Stan
ford community members, who
are being handed the "bum rap."
In addition, Lyman has im
plied that only the first of
SCRIP'S four demands, that the
trustees vote affirmatively on
Ford's shareholder resolution,
"had any real meaning." Al
though the first demand had
from the beginning been consi
dered the most essential, not
only by the protesters, but obvi
ously by the trustees themselves,
the negotiating committee stres
sed more than once that all four
demands were regarded as im
portant and necessary. The im
portance of the first demand
should have corneas no surprise,
since the motivating force be
hind the entire protest was based
on our conviction that the Ford
Motor Company must withdraw
from South Africa.
