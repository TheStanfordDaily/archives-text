# Hitler and Jews: why we aren't laughing
## 
### 
Robert Smith

Incident 1: There is a recent
trend in literature known as "Hi
tler revisionism." It started last
fall when Northwestern Univer
sity Professor Arthur Butz wrote
a book in which he argued that
the Holocaust — the liquidation
by the Nazis of six million Jews
— was a hoax.
It has been continued in a new
book by David Irving entitled
fust an Ordinary Man — lrving's
description of Adolf Hitler. Irv
ing said that he wrote the book to
"de-demonize" Hitler — his

premise is that Hitler was "an
ordinary, walking, talking
human weighing some 155
pounds, with graying hair,
largely false teeth, and chronic
digestive ailments," who knew
nothing about the systematic
execution of the Jews.
Incident 2: On April 20, 1977,
several drunken U.C. Berkeley
fraternity men — members of
Skull and Keys, a semi-secret
group made up of men from sev
eral Berkeley frats — vandalized
Berkeley's Chabad House, an or-

thodox Jewish teaching center
on the university's fraternity
row. During the vandalism, at
least one of the frat men shouted,
"Hitler was right," "Kill all the
lews," and "Gas 'em, gas 'em,
burn the Jews."
After complaints were made to
the Daily Cal, the Interfraternity
Council (IPC), and the Univer
sity, Skull and Key members
s'ought to downplay the inci
dent, as well as previous similar
ones. One said that the guy who
shouted the slogans "was trying
to be funny. He wasn't trying to
be anti-Semitic and in my mind,
he wasn't. It wasn't as bad as it
first sounded. You just have to
get light about this."
And the IPC president stated:
"It was an overextension of
ethnic humor, like Polish jokes.
It's funny if you don't take it
seriously. It was meant as a joke.
But no one laughed."
How could a group of Berkeley
students in 1977 think it might
be funny to shout "Gas 'em; Hi
tler was right; kill the Jews"?

How can two authors, neither
claiming to be Jew-haters, at
tempt to exonerate Hitler from
any guilt for the systematic mur
derofsix million Jews?
As a Jew, I struggle here as I try
to answer these questions. Chills
shoot up and down my spine as
bewilderment merges into anger
and then shock and frustration.
Por once, the thoughts don't
come easily. How can wofds
capture the intensity ifnd
breadth of my emotions on the
subject?
Perhaps it is the desensitiza
tion of youth at which I cringe.
Vietnam and Watergate have
dulled our senses. Six million is
only a number. And the older
generation has not helped. Un
able to deal with the Holocaust,
the parents of today's youth have
dismissed it as a grotesque ab
normality of the past. They con
sider their children to be com
pletely innocent of the savagery
of the Holocaust, and therefore
see no reason to burden them
with the fact of its horrible exis

tence.
To those of us who are Jews,
the Holocaust was the ultimate
in millenia of persecution. In
many respects it was the same as
previous instances of persecu
tion — yet at the same time it was
vastly different. We can't forget
that we were chosen to die
merely beccause of who and
what we were — and to die in
unprecedented numbers. And
the questions which the
Holocaust raised still haunt us:
How could it happen? Could it
happen again?
To those of you who are not
Jews, sit back and think about
your Jewish friends and acquain
tances — and then realize that if
they had lived in Nazi Germany,
they would all have been exter
minated in places like Dachau,
Auschwitz and Buchenwald.
Then you will understand why
we feel the Holocaust must not
be forgotten:-why Hitler re
visionism must be resisted.

capture the intensity ifnd
breadth of my emotions on the
subject?
Perhaps it is the desensitiza
tion of youth at which I cringe.
Vietnam and Watergate have
dulled our senses. Six million is
only a number. And the older
generation has not helped. Un
able to deal with the Holocaust,
the parents of today's youth have
dismissed it as a grotesque ab
normality of the past. They con
sider their children to be com
pletely innocent of the savagery
of the Holocaust, and therefore
see no reason to burden them
with the fact of its horrible exis

tence.
To those of us who are Jews,
the Holocaust was the ultimate
in millenia of persecution. In
many respects it was the same as
previous instances of persecu
tion — yet at the same time it was
vastly different. We can't forget
that we were chosen to die
merely beccause of who and
what we were — and to die in
unprecedented numbers. And
the questions which the
Holocaust raised still haunt us:
How could it happen? Could it
happen again?
To those of you who are not
Jews, sit back and think about
your Jewish friends and acquain
tances — and then realize that if
they had lived in Nazi Germany,
they would all have been exter
minated in places like Dachau,
Auschwitz and Buchenwald.
Then you will understand why
we feel the Holocaust must not
be forgotten:-why Hitler re
visionism must be resisted.

Incident 1: There is a recent
trend in literature known as "Hi
tler revisionism." It started last
fall when Northwestern Univer
sity Professor Arthur Butz wrote
a book in which he argued that
the Holocaust — the liquidation
by the Nazis of six million Jews
— was a hoax.
It has been continued in a new
book by David Irving entitled
fust an Ordinary Man — lrving's
description of Adolf Hitler. Irv
ing said that he wrote the book to
"de-demonize" Hitler — his

premise is that Hitler was "an
ordinary, walking, talking
human weighing some 155
pounds, with graying hair,
largely false teeth, and chronic
digestive ailments," who knew
nothing about the systematic
execution of the Jews.
Incident 2: On April 20, 1977,
several drunken U.C. Berkeley
fraternity men — members of
Skull and Keys, a semi-secret
group made up of men from sev
eral Berkeley frats — vandalized
Berkeley's Chabad House, an or-

thodox Jewish teaching center
on the university's fraternity
row. During the vandalism, at
least one of the frat men shouted,
"Hitler was right," "Kill all the
lews," and "Gas 'em, gas 'em,
burn the Jews."
After complaints were made to
the Daily Cal, the Interfraternity
Council (IPC), and the Univer
sity, Skull and Key members
s'ought to downplay the inci
dent, as well as previous similar
ones. One said that the guy who
shouted the slogans "was trying
to be funny. He wasn't trying to
be anti-Semitic and in my mind,
he wasn't. It wasn't as bad as it
first sounded. You just have to
get light about this."
And the IPC president stated:
"It was an overextension of
ethnic humor, like Polish jokes.
It's funny if you don't take it
seriously. It was meant as a joke.
But no one laughed."
How could a group of Berkeley
students in 1977 think it might
be funny to shout "Gas 'em; Hi
tler was right; kill the Jews"?

How can two authors, neither
claiming to be Jew-haters, at
tempt to exonerate Hitler from
any guilt for the systematic mur
derofsix million Jews?
As a Jew, I struggle here as I try
to answer these questions. Chills
shoot up and down my spine as
bewilderment merges into anger
and then shock and frustration.
Por once, the thoughts don't
come easily. How can wofds
capture the intensity ifnd
breadth of my emotions on the
subject?
