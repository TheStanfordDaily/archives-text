# Committee asks end to free parking
## 
### Mike Charlson 
University vice presidents will con
sider proposals today which would
make free parking a thing of the past
next fall for all but carpoolers and
handicapped individuals.
In a report submitted to President
Richard Lyman, the Committee on
Parking and Transportation (C-PT) re
commended charging $15 per year for
"C" parking permits, which are pre
sently free.
The recommendation was among
several designed to reduce further the
flow of traffic on campus, according to
committee member Dwight Miller, an
art professor.
The $60 charge for an "A" permit
and $40 charge for a "B" permit would
not change if committee recommenda
tions are accepted.
Handicapped persons and those par
ticipating in carpools would still be
eligible for free parking under the
plan. Carpools involving two people
would receive a free "C" permit, car
pools with three persons would re
ceive a free "B" permit and carpools of
four or more persons would receive a
free "A" permit.
Adopt all
The committee was unanimous in
its decisions to adopt all of the recom
mendations except the $15 fee, where
some dissent was voiced, Miller said.
Other committee suggestions in
cluded:
—urging Santa Clara County to raise
the bail for parking tickets from the
present $2 to at least $5 to increase
incentive for obeying parking regula
tions;
—requiring vehicles of vendors and
service representatvies parked on
campus to carry permits costing $1 per
day or $60 per year;
—ending the University policy of of
fering construction workers guaran
teed prime parking spaces, instead
providing parking in "C" lots for the
workers, and requiring them to use the
shuttle service;
—constructing a prototype visitor
information station before next fall
with possible construction of four ad
ditional stations during 1977-78; and
—maintaining the Marguerite shut
tle from Escondido Village to the Med
ical Center with a mid-day extension
to the Stanford Shopping Center, plus
addition of a new route.
The new route has not been desig
nated as yet. according to Assoc. In
dustrial Engineering Prof. James
Jucker, a committee member. He said
the experimental route running from
Serra St. along Campus Drive and
Mayfield Avenue to the Computation
Center is a possibility.
Neither Jucker nor Miller said they
felt the proposals would result in any
substantial uproar from the commun
ity.
"All of us felt that $15 per year
wasn't going to be an important issue
to anyone," Miller said.
There will probably be some objec
tion, Jucker said, but it won't be a big
uproar.

Center is a possibility.
Neither Jucker nor Miller said they
felt the proposals would result in any
substantial uproar from the commun
ity.
"All of us felt that $15 per year
wasn't going to be an important issue
to anyone," Miller said.
There will probably be some objec
tion, Jucker said, but it won't be a big
uproar.
University vice presidents will con
sider proposals today which would
make free parking a thing of the past
next fall for all but carpoolers and
handicapped individuals.
In a report submitted to President
Richard Lyman, the Committee on
Parking and Transportation (C-PT) re
commended charging $15 per year for
"C" parking permits, which are pre
sently free.
The recommendation was among
several designed to reduce further the
flow of traffic on campus, according to
committee member Dwight Miller, an
art professor.
The $60 charge for an "A" permit
and $40 charge for a "B" permit would
not change if committee recommenda
tions are accepted.
Handicapped persons and those par
ticipating in carpools would still be
eligible for free parking under the
plan. Carpools involving two people
would receive a free "C" permit, car
pools with three persons would re
ceive a free "B" permit and carpools of
four or more persons would receive a
free "A" permit.
Adopt all
The committee was unanimous in
its decisions to adopt all of the recom
mendations except the $15 fee, where
some dissent was voiced, Miller said.
Other committee suggestions in
cluded:
—urging Santa Clara County to raise
the bail for parking tickets from the
present $2 to at least $5 to increase
incentive for obeying parking regula
tions;
—requiring vehicles of vendors and
service representatvies parked on
campus to carry permits costing $1 per
day or $60 per year;
—ending the University policy of of
fering construction workers guaran
teed prime parking spaces, instead
providing parking in "C" lots for the
workers, and requiring them to use the
shuttle service;
—constructing a prototype visitor
information station before next fall
with possible construction of four ad
ditional stations during 1977-78; and
—maintaining the Marguerite shut
tle from Escondido Village to the Med
ical Center with a mid-day extension
to the Stanford Shopping Center, plus
addition of a new route.
The new route has not been desig
nated as yet. according to Assoc. In
dustrial Engineering Prof. James
Jucker, a committee member. He said
the experimental route running from
Serra St. along Campus Drive and
Mayfield Avenue to the Computation
Center is a possibility.
Neither Jucker nor Miller said they
