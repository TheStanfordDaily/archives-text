In discussing koenig's report,
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
agrees wit li its basic premise that
Israel is a state tor Jews only.
"What matters is government
policy, and not a document writ
ten hy this or that civil ser
vant. . . . We do not speak in two
languages.
We state plainly that theaim of
the state of Israel is the realiza
tion of the Zionist vision, of in
gathering the exiles and living
the life of a Jewish state. How
ever, this aim does not in any
way negate the full rights of
non-Jewish citizens of Israel
who are ready to live with this
aim."
The Zionist aim to gather in
Israel all 15 million of the
world's Jews still "in exile"
would leave no room at all for
non-Jews. It is obvious that the
"Zionist vision" is to continue
expanding into more Arab land
as witnessed ever since 1948.
How could Arab citizens of Is
rael be "ready to live" in a Jewish
state with this aim?
Al-Quds, tlv leading Arab
daily in East Jerusalem, states
that special attention should be
paid to the koenig memorandom
as it reflects the official outlook
towards the local Arabs in Israel
and the occupied territories.
Jamal i arabeh, Arab mayor of
the large Galilee town of
Sakhnin, reports that during the
past 13 years of koenig's reign in
the northern district he has "not
only advocated a system of re
wards and punishment for the
Arabs, as set out in his
memorandum but practiced it,
and we in Sakhnin were at the
receiving end. for tlie last seven
months he has not let us have a

single agora from Government
funds."
Following are excerpts from
the Koenig report first published
in the Hebrew daily (AI-
Hasmishmar, September 7,
1976, translated into English by
Dr. Israel Shahak. Comments by
Shahak are in parentheses:
(A) Those who speuk Arabic:
As the military government
was abolished, the state gave
away the handling of the Arab
population to those who speak
Arabic. (Meaning the Oriental
Jews. Koenig and his co-authors
do not speak Arabic.)
The criterion of those who
deal with the Arab sector on all
levels — political, military,
police, and civil — was similar
to the Arabic mentality. (A belief
in "Arab mentality" is basic to
Zionism racism.) They were not
always distinguished by a level
of intelligence and of perfor
mance which was above that of
the population under their
care.
(B) The demographic problem:
The rate of the natural
growth of the Arab population in
Israel is 5.9 per cent in compari
son with 1.5 per cent rate of the
natural growth of the Jewish
population per anum. That prob
lem is especially acute in the
Northern district, wherein . . .
the Arabs will constitute over 51
per cent 1978.
1) To broaden and deepen the
Jewish settlement in regons
where the continuity of the Arab
population is conspicuous and
their number is too much above
the Jewish population, and to
check the possibility of thinning
the concentrations of existing
Arab population, ("thinning,"
the agricultural expression, is

used in Gaza Strip and other
conquered territories in the
meaning "to expel, to remove."
This is an expression worthy of
Adolf Eichmann, and accurately
describes his first activities, for
example in Austria in 1938-
1939, where he was very suc
cessful in "thinning" the Jewish
population whose concentration
and continuity in many areas of
Vienna, were thought objection
able by the Nazis.)
2) To introduce a policy of re
ward and punishment, within
the framework of the law, con
cerning leaders and settlements
which express themselves in any
form which is hostile towards
the state of Zionism. (Free ex
pression in Israel is officially a
Jewish privilege.)
(C) Problem of Arab education:
That population with an edu
cation, even if it is a superficial
and provincial one, constitutes
the active part of every
chauvinistic movement and
especially in the present condi
tion of the Arabs in Israel.
Reasons for for the problem
are favored criteria (low grades)
for admission of Arab students to
the various higher education in
stitutions (this is a pure lie, as I
can testify from my experience
as a teacher at Hebrew Univer
sity) and the subjects to which
they have been directed (by for
bidding mathematics and sci
ence at an advanced level in
most Arab high schools)
humanities, political and social
sciences, the lack of concern and
the impossibility of finding
work for all the graduates —
have created a large population
of frustrated "educated people"
who have deep psychological
need for finding vent for their

feeling. This is expressed in
being against the Israeli estab
lishment and the state.
(D) Proposals:
1) Keep the same criteria for
Arabs and Jews for admission of
students to universities. Keep
ing those rules will create a
natural selection and will de
crease significantly the number
of students. (The same misused
"natural selection" that Hitler
invoked rather often.)
2) Encourage the direction of
students to technical professions
and to exact and natural sci
ences. Those studies leave less
time for engagement in
chauvinism and the fallout of
students in high. (As a teacher of
chemistry in classes which con
tain many Arabs, I can testify
that Koenig, together with other
racists, is mistaken.)
3) Make it easy for them to go
abroad for studying and make it
difficult for them to return and to
find a job — that policy might
help their immigration.
One should emphasize that
whereas the Arab population
today constitutes about 14 per
cent and no labor force is taken
by military service for three
years, the total sum of taxes paid
by it is about 1.5 per cent.
(E) Problem of law enforcement:
Among the Arab population
there is consciousness, founded
upon facts, that one can evade
the law of the state by means of
the right contacts with the right
people. This is, and rightly so,
the predominant opinion of Is
raeli Jews too.
