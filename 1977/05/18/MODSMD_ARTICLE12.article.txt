# Educational goals need defining

In response to Allan Chen's ar
ticle, "Stanford Deserves a D"
(Daily, May 10), 1 suggest that if
the University has enabled him
to discern the deficiencies he
cites by the end of his freshman
year, then something more than
a minimal pass is justified. The
thrust of his article would seem
to assign that 'D' to all of higher
education, not just Stanford.
In any event, several things
need to be said. First, few
would disagree that the rapid
pace here can be troubling. If a
solution is suggested in the arti
cle, it is unclear to me, but there
seem to be two alternatives:
either slow the pace of work and
delay entrance into the "real
world" or cut the amount of
work done. Both of these op
tions, however unattractive, are
already open to the student.
More direction
Second, lack of direction is
also a problem for many stu
dents. If Chen is suggesting that
the University give (translation:
require) more direction to stu
dents, his proposal — though
some may agree with it person
ally — will not be palatable to
many students who wish to
exercise full discretion in mak
ing their own decisions.
Third, the article contains
explicit but largely unsupported
criticism of students who "are
concerned only with getting a
job, building a career, and gain
ing contentment." Noone would
argue, to follow the lineofthink
ing presented, that all humans
would not be benefited by giv
ing more thought "to under
standing their role and respon
sibilities in society." Hut the im
plied syllogism that a student in

terested in building a career has
not thought about his or her role
in society does not follow and
simply is not accurate.
There are many students here
who are quite sure of their direc
tion, quite intent on building a
career, and who are simultane
ously deeply concerned wtih
understanding society and their
role in it.
Chen poses the question,
"How is the student graduating
from college to deal with the
trauma of adjusting to the real
world?" Three are, granted,
many persons who experience
difficulty at that transition, but
such "trauma" is scarcely in
evitable. The vast majority of
Stanford's graduates move with
relative ease into the next phase
of their lives; that has always
been so and will always be so.
Finally, there is the assertion
that insufficient correlation
exists between education here
and "real-world" experiences.
Since I am not sure what "real
world" experiences are in his
context or why they-are so diffe
rent, let me say only that the
major part of every person's life
is spent in interacting with other
people, regardless of one's voca
tion, age, intelligence, or physi
cal location.
In that sense and because I be
lieve the alleged dichotomy be
tween "higher education" and
the "real world" is not nearly so
clear as Chen would like us to
believe, I do not acknowledge
that "a truly effective education
would integrate the 'doing'
phase with the 'learning' phase
more thoroughly." This asser
tion conveniently omits a set of
criteria to define "effective" and

posits a disparity between "do
ing" (life after college) and
"learning" (life in college)
which is contradicted by the
previous sentence, .. in fact
both phases are learning experi
ences."
Other words like "integra
tion" and "interdisciplinary"
and "elite" and "uneducated"
and "real world" are easy to
write, but assume meaning only

as they are relentlessly and
rigorously defined. In the end, 1
applaud Chen's interest in his
own education regardless of
whether we agree and strongly
support his closing thought for
all of us, whether student or not:
"Ask yourself every now and
then, 'what are the goals of my
education?' "

In response to Allan Chen's ar
ticle, "Stanford Deserves a D"
(Daily, May 10), 1 suggest that if
the University has enabled him
to discern the deficiencies he
cites by the end of his freshman
year, then something more than
a minimal pass is justified. The
thrust of his article would seem
to assign that 'D' to all of higher
education, not just Stanford.
In any event, several things
need to be said. First, few
would disagree that the rapid
pace here can be troubling. If a
solution is suggested in the arti
cle, it is unclear to me, but there
seem to be two alternatives:
either slow the pace of work and
delay entrance into the "real
world" or cut the amount of
work done. Both of these op
tions, however unattractive, are
already open to the student.
More direction
Second, lack of direction is
also a problem for many stu
dents. If Chen is suggesting that
the University give (translation:
require) more direction to stu
dents, his proposal — though
some may agree with it person
ally — will not be palatable to
many students who wish to
exercise full discretion in mak
ing their own decisions.
Third, the article contains
explicit but largely unsupported
criticism of students who "are
concerned only with getting a
job, building a career, and gain
ing contentment." Noone would
argue, to follow the lineofthink
ing presented, that all humans
would not be benefited by giv
ing more thought "to under
standing their role and respon
sibilities in society." Hut the im
plied syllogism that a student in

terested in building a career has
not thought about his or her role
in society does not follow and
simply is not accurate.
There are many students here
who are quite sure of their direc
tion, quite intent on building a
career, and who are simultane
ously deeply concerned wtih
understanding society and their
role in it.
Chen poses the question,
"How is the student graduating
from college to deal with the
trauma of adjusting to the real
world?" Three are, granted,
many persons who experience
difficulty at that transition, but
such "trauma" is scarcely in
evitable. The vast majority of
Stanford's graduates move with
relative ease into the next phase
of their lives; that has always
been so and will always be so.
Finally, there is the assertion
that insufficient correlation
exists between education here
and "real-world" experiences.
Since I am not sure what "real
world" experiences are in his
context or why they-are so diffe
rent, let me say only that the
major part of every person's life
is spent in interacting with other
people, regardless of one's voca
tion, age, intelligence, or physi
cal location.
In that sense and because I be
lieve the alleged dichotomy be
tween "higher education" and
the "real world" is not nearly so
clear as Chen would like us to
believe, I do not acknowledge
that "a truly effective education
would integrate the 'doing'
phase with the 'learning' phase
more thoroughly." This asser
tion conveniently omits a set of
criteria to define "effective" and

posits a disparity between "do
ing" (life after college) and
"learning" (life in college)
which is contradicted by the
previous sentence, .. in fact
both phases are learning experi
ences."
Other words like "integra
tion" and "interdisciplinary"
and "elite" and "uneducated"
and "real world" are easy to
write, but assume meaning only

as they are relentlessly and
rigorously defined. In the end, 1
applaud Chen's interest in his
own education regardless of
whether we agree and strongly
support his closing thought for
all of us, whether student or not:
