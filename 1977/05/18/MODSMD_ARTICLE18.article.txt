# Soviets woo Ethiopia
## 
### 
Moscow (AC) — The Soviet Union, eager to
exploit its new opportunity in East Africa, is
concentrating on bolstering its ties with
Ethiopia's troubled military leadership.
The proposition is attractive to the men in the
Kremlin because an alliance with Ethiopia pro
vides the possibility for a deeper penetration ot
the African continent at the expense of the Un
ited States.
The Ethiopians have just expelled more than
three-fourths of the U.S. personnel stationed in
their country, despite a long history of
American-Ethiopian friendship.
But there are indications the Soviet leader
ship, conscious of the risks involved, wants to
hedge its bets. The ruling Ethiopian military
council may not survive the crisis brought on by
several armed insurrections by secessionists,
monarchists and Marxist guerrillas.
Soviet Communist party leader Leonid
Brezhnev underscored the growing ties with
Moscow's new friend by meeting here last week
with the visiting head of the military council,
Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.
Details of Mengistu's discussion with
Brezhnev and other Soviet officials, including
Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov, were not dis
closed. But it was apparent the Ethiopian leader
sought military aid.
Western sources here noted the emphasis on

"strengthening security" in a joint statement by
the two governments. But the sources said their
over-all impression was that the Soviets were
stopping short ot a full commitment until they
see whether Mengistu and his council can
maintain internal control.
Brezhnev's VIP welcome and the emphasis
given the official visit in the official media re
flect Moscow's interest in accelerating its rela
tions with Ethiopia.
But this interest must be balanced against the
Soviets' considerable stake in neighboring
Somalia, where they have a missile storage base
and facilities for their air force and Indian
Ocean fleet.
A Moslem nation and Arab League member,
Somalia appears to be swinging out of the
Soviet orbit and into a more moderate position,
prompted by the lure of Saudi Arabian
economic aid.
Other conservative Arab states on the vital
Red Sea oil route —Egypt and Sudan —are en
couraging this trend, which suits U.S. policy
interests in this area of rapidly changing rela
tionships.
The Somalis and the Ethiopians long have
been bitter foes. Somalia claims the Ogaden
region in southern Ethiopia as part ot its territ
ory and is supporting insurrectionists there.
