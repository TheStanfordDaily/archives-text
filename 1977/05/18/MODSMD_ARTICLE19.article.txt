# Carter auto rebates face criticism

### 
Washington (Ai 1 ) — President
Jimmy Carter's proposed rebates
tor purchasers of fuel-efficient
cars ran head-on into a wall ol
skeptical congressmen Monday.
One by one, members ot the
House Ways and Means Com
mittee argued against the idea on
grounds that a big share ot the
rebates would go to buyers ol
small foreign cars.
Treasury Secretary Michael
Blumenthal could promise only
that any arrangement for rebates
to buyers of imported cars would
not put U.S. auto makers at a dis
advantage.
"I think it's in trouble," Kep.
Al Ullman, the committee
chairman, said of tfie rebate.
Blumenthal said the rebate
plan is not nearly so popular in
Congress as the idea of taxing
inefficient cars But after a few
seconds, he corrected himself
and told reporters the tax on
"gas-guzzlers" is not nearly so
unpopular as the rebate.
Defense
The secretary's remarks came
after two hours of defending the
Carter package of energy taxes

against criticism from Democ
rats and Republicans alike.
Rep. Barber Conable (R-N.Y.),
ranking Republican on Ways
and Means, assailed the Carter
package as more a tax program
than an energy plan.
"At the most —or worst—it is a
major scheme of income redis
tribution, which seeks to take
earned income from the pockets
of working Americans and give
some of it back in the apparent
form of the ill-conceived and
now totally rejected $50 rebate,"
Conable said.
Congress gave Carter's $50-
per-person rebate plan a
lukewarm reception, but it ap
peared headed for passage be
fore the president withdrew it
last month as no longer needed
to stimulate the economy.
Retroactive
Despite his opposition, Con
able joined Ullman and their
counterparts on the Senate Fi
nance Committee in agreeing
with the administration that if
passed, Carter's tax rebates for
fuel-efficient cars and home in
sulation should be retroactive to
April 20.
Ullman, in opening hearings
on the energy tax proposals,
noted the Carter package is
under attack generally from two
quarters: those who don't think
it is tough enough and those who
say it provides little incentive for
energy producers.
Responding to the first con
cern, Blumenthal said: "Over the
next seven years we are going
just about as far as one can
reasonably expect the American
economy to afford."
Pushing energy prices too
high, he suggested, could mean
sharply higher inflation.
Incentives
As for more incentives for
energy producers, the treasury

secretary said, "A program
which provides for the Ameri
can oil industry to achieve the
full world price of oil...should be
a very powerful incentive to go
out and find new sources."
The Carter administration is
not about to propose an im
mediate end to price controls on
petroleum, which would mean
windfall profits to a handful of
companies, Blumenthal said.
In an effort to reduce energy
consumption. Carter proposed a
series of taxes on crude oil,
which would raise the price of
gasoline by 7.6 cents a gallon by
1980; a standby increase of as
much as 50 cents a gallon in the
4-cent federal tax on gasoline—
but only if consumption con
tinues to rise unchecked; and the
rebates and taxes on purchases
of cars that get above- or below
average mileage.
Rebates
A 1978 car getting 19 miles per
gallon would qualify for a $47
rebate; by 1985 the rebates
would start at 27.5 m.p.g. A 1978
car getting less than 13 m.p.g.
would be taxed $449; by 1985
the tax for cars under 12.5 m.p.g.
would be $2488.
The Ways and Means Commit
tee members concentrated their
fire on the standby gasoline tax,
which has been in trouble from
the day it was proposed, and on
the auto rebate scheme.
Rep. J.J. Pickle (D-Tex.) scof
fed at Blumenthal's forecast that
there is only a 50-50 chance that
the standby gasoline tax would
ever be implemented if Congress
authorized it.
"It's almost a lead-pipe cinch
that every year there'd be a
5-cent increase in the federal
tax," Pickle said.
Imports
As for the rebate idea, Ullman
said, "The problem is there are

so many fuel-efficient import
s.... There is great resentment to
giving rebates to imported cars
by taxing domestic cars, which
are traditionally larger."
Therefore, he added, chances
of passing the rebate are margi
nal, although "I think we can get
the votes to pass" the gas
guzzler tax.
Ullman told Blumenthal the
committee "will likely change
the shape — but hopefully not the
thrust — of" the tax portion of the
president's program.
Some congressmen who op
pose the rebate fear it could set
off a trade war with Western
Europe and Japan, which export
many small cars to the United
States.
Blumenthal conceded that any
program of government price
support for U.S.-made cars —
including the tax rebates —
might be construed as a violation
of trade agreements. But the U.S.
negotiating position will be that
it would be unreasonable for
foreign manufacturers to insist on
enforcing that claim, he added.
Concessions
Blumenthal expressed the
hope that such a U.S. position
would not prompt other nations
to insist on concessions in other
trade areas.
He rejected pleas from two
California Democrats, Represen
tatives Fortney Stark and James
Corman, that the government
simply ban further production of
gas-hungry cars.
"We should let the market
mechanism work," Blumenthal
said, contending that some
Americans will insist on buying
big cars no matter how high the
penalty.
"Then we should legalize
marijuana and heroin since
that's what the market wants,"
Stark said.

Carter package of energy taxes

against criticism from Democ
rats and Republicans alike.
Rep. Barber Conable (R-N.Y.),
ranking Republican on Ways
and Means, assailed the Carter
package as more a tax program
than an energy plan.
"At the most —or worst—it is a
major scheme of income redis
tribution, which seeks to take
earned income from the pockets
of working Americans and give
some of it back in the apparent
form of the ill-conceived and
now totally rejected $50 rebate,"
Conable said.
Congress gave Carter's $50-
per-person rebate plan a
lukewarm reception, but it ap
peared headed for passage be
fore the president withdrew it
last month as no longer needed
to stimulate the economy.
Retroactive
Despite his opposition, Con
able joined Ullman and their
counterparts on the Senate Fi
nance Committee in agreeing
with the administration that if
passed, Carter's tax rebates for
fuel-efficient cars and home in
sulation should be retroactive to
April 20.
Ullman, in opening hearings
on the energy tax proposals,
noted the Carter package is
under attack generally from two
quarters: those who don't think
it is tough enough and those who
say it provides little incentive for
energy producers.
Responding to the first con
cern, Blumenthal said: "Over the
next seven years we are going
just about as far as one can
reasonably expect the American
economy to afford."
Pushing energy prices too
high, he suggested, could mean
sharply higher inflation.
Incentives
As for more incentives for
energy producers, the treasury

secretary said, "A program
which provides for the Ameri
can oil industry to achieve the
full world price of oil...should be
a very powerful incentive to go
out and find new sources."
The Carter administration is
not about to propose an im
mediate end to price controls on
petroleum, which would mean
windfall profits to a handful of
companies, Blumenthal said.
In an effort to reduce energy
consumption. Carter proposed a
series of taxes on crude oil,
which would raise the price of
gasoline by 7.6 cents a gallon by
1980; a standby increase of as
much as 50 cents a gallon in the
4-cent federal tax on gasoline—
but only if consumption con
tinues to rise unchecked; and the
rebates and taxes on purchases
of cars that get above- or below
average mileage.
Rebates
A 1978 car getting 19 miles per
gallon would qualify for a $47
rebate; by 1985 the rebates
would start at 27.5 m.p.g. A 1978
car getting less than 13 m.p.g.
would be taxed $449; by 1985
the tax for cars under 12.5 m.p.g.
would be $2488.
The Ways and Means Commit
tee members concentrated their
fire on the standby gasoline tax,
which has been in trouble from
the day it was proposed, and on
the auto rebate scheme.
Rep. J.J. Pickle (D-Tex.) scof
fed at Blumenthal's forecast that
there is only a 50-50 chance that
the standby gasoline tax would
ever be implemented if Congress
authorized it.
"It's almost a lead-pipe cinch
that every year there'd be a
5-cent increase in the federal
tax," Pickle said.
Imports
As for the rebate idea, Ullman
said, "The problem is there are

so many fuel-efficient import
s.... There is great resentment to
giving rebates to imported cars
by taxing domestic cars, which
are traditionally larger."
Therefore, he added, chances
of passing the rebate are margi
nal, although "I think we can get
the votes to pass" the gas
guzzler tax.
Ullman told Blumenthal the
committee "will likely change
the shape — but hopefully not the
thrust — of" the tax portion of the
president's program.
Some congressmen who op
pose the rebate fear it could set
off a trade war with Western
Europe and Japan, which export
many small cars to the United
States.
Blumenthal conceded that any
program of government price
support for U.S.-made cars —
including the tax rebates —
might be construed as a violation
of trade agreements. But the U.S.
negotiating position will be that
it would be unreasonable for
foreign manufacturers to insist on
enforcing that claim, he added.
Concessions
Blumenthal expressed the
hope that such a U.S. position
would not prompt other nations
to insist on concessions in other
trade areas.
He rejected pleas from two
California Democrats, Represen
tatives Fortney Stark and James
Corman, that the government
simply ban further production of
gas-hungry cars.
"We should let the market
mechanism work," Blumenthal
said, contending that some
Americans will insist on buying
big cars no matter how high the
penalty.
"Then we should legalize
marijuana and heroin since
that's what the market wants,"
Stark said.

fuel-efficient cars and home in
sulation should be retroactive to
April 20.
Ullman, in opening hearings
on the energy tax proposals,
noted the Carter package is
under attack generally from two
quarters: those who don't think
it is tough enough and those who
say it provides little incentive for
energy producers.
Responding to the first con
cern, Blumenthal said: "Over the
next seven years we are going
just about as far as one can
reasonably expect the American
economy to afford."
Pushing energy prices too
high, he suggested, could mean
sharply higher inflation.
Incentives
As for more incentives for
energy producers, the treasury

secretary said, "A program
which provides for the Ameri
can oil industry to achieve the
full world price of oil...should be
a very powerful incentive to go
out and find new sources."
The Carter administration is
not about to propose an im
mediate end to price controls on
petroleum, which would mean
windfall profits to a handful of
companies, Blumenthal said.
In an effort to reduce energy
consumption. Carter proposed a
series of taxes on crude oil,
which would raise the price of
gasoline by 7.6 cents a gallon by
1980; a standby increase of as
much as 50 cents a gallon in the
4-cent federal tax on gasoline—
but only if consumption con
tinues to rise unchecked; and the
rebates and taxes on purchases
of cars that get above- or below
average mileage.
Rebates
A 1978 car getting 19 miles per
gallon would qualify for a $47
rebate; by 1985 the rebates
would start at 27.5 m.p.g. A 1978
car getting less than 13 m.p.g.
would be taxed $449; by 1985
the tax for cars under 12.5 m.p.g.
would be $2488.
The Ways and Means Commit
tee members concentrated their
fire on the standby gasoline tax,
which has been in trouble from
the day it was proposed, and on
the auto rebate scheme.
Rep. J.J. Pickle (D-Tex.) scof
fed at Blumenthal's forecast that
there is only a 50-50 chance that
the standby gasoline tax would
ever be implemented if Congress
authorized it.
"It's almost a lead-pipe cinch
that every year there'd be a
5-cent increase in the federal
tax," Pickle said.
Imports
As for the rebate idea, Ullman
said, "The problem is there are

so many fuel-efficient import
s.... There is great resentment to
giving rebates to imported cars
by taxing domestic cars, which
are traditionally larger."
Therefore, he added, chances
of passing the rebate are margi
nal, although "I think we can get
the votes to pass" the gas
guzzler tax.
Ullman told Blumenthal the
committee "will likely change
the shape — but hopefully not the
thrust — of" the tax portion of the
president's program.
Some congressmen who op
pose the rebate fear it could set
off a trade war with Western
Europe and Japan, which export
many small cars to the United
States.
Blumenthal conceded that any
program of government price
support for U.S.-made cars —
including the tax rebates —
might be construed as a violation
of trade agreements. But the U.S.
negotiating position will be that
it would be unreasonable for
foreign manufacturers to insist on
enforcing that claim, he added.
Concessions
Blumenthal expressed the
hope that such a U.S. position
would not prompt other nations
to insist on concessions in other
trade areas.
He rejected pleas from two
California Democrats, Represen
tatives Fortney Stark and James
Corman, that the government
simply ban further production of
gas-hungry cars.
"We should let the market
mechanism work," Blumenthal
said, contending that some
Americans will insist on buying
big cars no matter how high the
penalty.
"Then we should legalize
marijuana and heroin since
that's what the market wants,"
Stark said.
Washington (Ai 1 ) — President
Jimmy Carter's proposed rebates
tor purchasers of fuel-efficient
cars ran head-on into a wall ol
skeptical congressmen Monday.
One by one, members ot the
House Ways and Means Com
mittee argued against the idea on
grounds that a big share ot the
rebates would go to buyers ol
small foreign cars.
Treasury Secretary Michael
Blumenthal could promise only
that any arrangement for rebates
to buyers of imported cars would
not put U.S. auto makers at a dis
advantage.
"I think it's in trouble," Kep.
Al Ullman, the committee
chairman, said of tfie rebate.
Blumenthal said the rebate
plan is not nearly so popular in
Congress as the idea of taxing
inefficient cars But after a few
seconds, he corrected himself
and told reporters the tax on
"gas-guzzlers" is not nearly so
unpopular as the rebate.
Defense
The secretary's remarks came
after two hours of defending the
Carter package of energy taxes

against criticism from Democ
rats and Republicans alike.
Rep. Barber Conable (R-N.Y.),
ranking Republican on Ways
and Means, assailed the Carter
package as more a tax program
than an energy plan.
"At the most —or worst—it is a
major scheme of income redis
tribution, which seeks to take
earned income from the pockets
of working Americans and give
some of it back in the apparent
form of the ill-conceived and
now totally rejected $50 rebate,"
Conable said.
Congress gave Carter's $50-
per-person rebate plan a
lukewarm reception, but it ap
peared headed for passage be
fore the president withdrew it
last month as no longer needed
to stimulate the economy.
Retroactive
Despite his opposition, Con
able joined Ullman and their
counterparts on the Senate Fi
nance Committee in agreeing
with the administration that if
passed, Carter's tax rebates for
fuel-efficient cars and home in
sulation should be retroactive to
April 20.
