# Boosting production
## King Coal's dilemma 
### 
Pittsburgh (AP) — The United
States has enough coal to meet
energy requirements at current
levels for 300 years. So how
come coal supplied less than 20
per cent of our total energy needs
last year?
King Coal is not meeting its
potential. It's not even close. Re
lative consumption has in
creased a scant one per cent
since the Arab oil embargo of
1973 when President Richard
Nixon launched Project Inde
pendence to achieve energy
self-sufficiency by 1985.
Now there's another president
with another plan for energy in
dependence. And this president,
once again, has made coal the
foundation of his energy prop
osals.
The coal industry is skeptical.
"We hear that coal is about to
get elected messiah —the new
savior of the people, the sure
guide for a return to the prom
ised land of 72 degree living
rooms, full employment and
thumbing our noses at the
Arabs," said Edwin Phelps, pres
ident of Peabody Coal Co. "This
does not mean the public now
understands coal. About the
only thing the public has learned
is that we have lots of it."
Once a booming industry, coal
stagnated after World War 11,
when the nation switched to
cleaner oil and gas. The industry
is now enjoying a modest upsw
ing and last year posted a record
665 million tons of production.
Carter would like that figureto
top one billion tons by 1985, and
he wants coal to be burned in all
new utility and industrial plants
where possible. To prod the
changeover, he intends to tax the
use of gas and oil.
Coal producers say the one
billion ton target is possible, but
only if environmental laws are
eased, something the Carter ad
ministration has pledged not to
do.
One of the industry's chief
complaints is that the Clean Air
Act of 1970 sets unmeetable
limits for the emission of sulfur
dioxide.
The act has, in effect, out
lawed the use of almost all coal
mined east of the Mississippi
River because of its high sulfur
content.
What rankles the industry
more than anything is Carter's
support of environmental mea
sures that are even stricter than
those already in effect.
A strip mine bill recently pas
sed the House and will likely be
approved soon by the Senate. It
would set up for the first time
federal controls on surface min
ing.
The measure includes mining
restrictions in many valleys in

the West, which have most of the
nation's low-sulfur coal.
Carl Hagge, president of the
National Coal Association, said
the bill would prohibit mining of
240 million tons of coal.
Meanwhile, Carter also backs
a proposed amendment to the
Clean Air Act that would require
scrubbers—devices that wash
pollutants out of stack gases—on
all new coal-fired boilers.
Utilities are opposed to scrub
bers, calling them unreliable, too
expensive and a source of new
pollution—a toothpaste-like
sludge that must be disposed.
If coal production is boosted,
what does it mean to the con
sumer?
Few Americans will have di
rect contact with coal as an
energy source; there are no
moves to bring back the family
coal furnace. 7'he fuel's largest
impact will be on the electric in
dustry, which uses coal to make
steam for turbine generators.
The Edison Electric Institute

estimates that mandatory con
version to coal will cost the in
dustry about $71 billion by 1985,
taking a seven per cent inflation
rate into account.
While it is difficult to say what
the cost may be to an individual
because of the variables in
volved, the National Economic
Research Association in New
York has arrived at some aver
ages.
Louis Perl said the average
household electric bill for 1975
was $264. The total cost of elec
tricity, including power used in
products and services the con
sumer buys, was $659.
By 1990, Perl said the residen
tial bill would go up to about
$500 and the total electrical cost
would be $1200. Add in the cost
of clean air requirements and
proposed amendments to the
law, and the total cost goes up by
another $158 per household, for
a total of $1358.
