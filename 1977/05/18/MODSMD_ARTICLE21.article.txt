I recently heard a story on KCBS radio that
there is a kind of climbing rose whose color
is know us Stanford red" because this par
ticular variety groivs "profusely" on cam
pus. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable
of the Stanford campus, yet in all my wan
derings, I don t recall ever coming across a
rose, let alone a plot of red roses. Perhaps
there are a few rose bushes planted on the
How or in faculty housing, but I have never
seen anything to fit this radio story's de
scription. Is there such a bloom? If so, where
can it be found'
-B.h.
Well, I called KCBS radio and they really
couldn't help since all their news files are
listed by day and hour, not by subject matter.
So unless you can remember the date and the
hour, KCBS is out.
However, John Thomas, associate profes
sor of biology, said that they were probably
talking about the roses which grow pro
fusely along El Camino Real from San Fran
cisquito Creek to Stanford Ave. In his 30
years here, he has never heard them referred
to as "Stanford red," but if any were to be
called that color, those along El Camino

would be the likeliest candidates.
What are the policies concerning livers
being posted on various buildings around
campus, specifically the Post Office and
Tresidder Union? I have noticed flyers or
announcements rarely last long on the pil
lars of the P.O. and wonder if this is due to
any kind of official policy. j
Both the Post Office and Tresidder Union
have their own policies concerning the post
ing of flyers on the buildings.
Kenneth Mar of the Stanford Post Office
says that there is a federal regulation pro
hibiting the posting of flyers on the P.O. "If
not, we'd have that stuff pasted all over the
building," he says.
Tresidder has a similar policy, allowing
posters and flyers only on bulletin boards,
according to Susie Farr at Public Events.
So if you want your flyers to be noticed, be
sure and post them on a legal surface!

Do pluses and minuses on class grades
actually go on the transcript and count on
your GPA?
-a concerned pre-med

According to Robert Hamrdla, director ol
tlie Academic Information Center, pluses
and minuses "do go on the transcript."
However, thelJniversity no longer computes
a CiPA for gr.id schools. This practice was
abolished around 1970, when the I) and F
were eliminated.
So the decision as to whether to include
pluses and minuses in the C.P A calculation is
a matter left up to eadh graduate school. And
some of them calculate CiPAs to five decimal
places.
Before 1970, when the University did cal
culate a CPA, Hamrdla says pluses and
minuses were not included.
If you have any further questions about the
grading system, it is explained fully in the
Stanford University Bulletin under Grading
System. Or just bop on over to tbe AIC, where
they will answer just about any question
concerning academic policies.

says that there is a federal regulation pro
hibiting the posting of flyers on the P.O. "If
not, we'd have that stuff pasted all over the
building," he says.
Tresidder has a similar policy, allowing
posters and flyers only on bulletin boards,
according to Susie Farr at Public Events.
So if you want your flyers to be noticed, be
sure and post them on a legal surface!

Do pluses and minuses on class grades
actually go on the transcript and count on
your GPA?
-a concerned pre-med

According to Robert Hamrdla, director ol
tlie Academic Information Center, pluses
and minuses "do go on the transcript."
However, thelJniversity no longer computes
a CiPA for gr.id schools. This practice was
abolished around 1970, when the I) and F
were eliminated.
So the decision as to whether to include
pluses and minuses in the C.P A calculation is
a matter left up to eadh graduate school. And
some of them calculate CiPAs to five decimal
places.
Before 1970, when the University did cal
culate a CPA, Hamrdla says pluses and
minuses were not included.
If you have any further questions about the
grading system, it is explained fully in the
Stanford University Bulletin under Grading
System. Or just bop on over to tbe AIC, where
they will answer just about any question
concerning academic policies.

I recently heard a story on KCBS radio that
there is a kind of climbing rose whose color
is know us Stanford red" because this par
ticular variety groivs "profusely" on cam
pus. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable
of the Stanford campus, yet in all my wan
derings, I don t recall ever coming across a
rose, let alone a plot of red roses. Perhaps
there are a few rose bushes planted on the
How or in faculty housing, but I have never
seen anything to fit this radio story's de
scription. Is there such a bloom? If so, where
can it be found'
-B.h.
Well, I called KCBS radio and they really
couldn't help since all their news files are
listed by day and hour, not by subject matter.
So unless you can remember the date and the
hour, KCBS is out.
However, John Thomas, associate profes
sor of biology, said that they were probably
talking about the roses which grow pro
fusely along El Camino Real from San Fran
cisquito Creek to Stanford Ave. In his 30
years here, he has never heard them referred
to as "Stanford red," but if any were to be
called that color, those along El Camino

would be the likeliest candidates.
What are the policies concerning livers
being posted on various buildings around
campus, specifically the Post Office and
Tresidder Union? I have noticed flyers or
announcements rarely last long on the pil
lars of the P.O. and wonder if this is due to
any kind of official policy. j
Both the Post Office and Tresidder Union
have their own policies concerning the post
ing of flyers on the buildings.
Kenneth Mar of the Stanford Post Office
says that there is a federal regulation pro
hibiting the posting of flyers on the P.O. "If
not, we'd have that stuff pasted all over the
