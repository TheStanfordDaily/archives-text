# Big Foot: another sighting
## 
### 
Mission, British Columbia
(AP) — "To tell you the truth, 1
thought it was someone trying to
con us so 1 took oft after it. 1 guess
I thought I was going to pull off
his hat and bawl him out. I don't
know why I did it. I'm not sure I
really intended to catch up with
it," said bus driver Pat
Lindquist.
He was talking about the latest
reported sighting of "Bigfoot," a
big, furry, foul-smelling creature
that some people claim haunts
the Pacific Northwest woods.
A group of Canadians was
startled Sunday about 35 miles
east of Vancouver on Highway 7
when the creature popped into
view.
Lindquist and four passengers
aboard the Pacific Stage Lines
bus said they saw a seven-foot
tall creature, about 300 pounds,
with a light-colored face and co
vered with dark hair.
Fur suit
"At first we thought it was a
prankster in a fur suit," said
Lindquist, a reserve Vancouver
city policeman. "But people
were shouting 'what is it, what is
it', so I slammed on the brakes to
have a look.
"The first thing I noticed was
the smell," Lindquist said later.
Recalled it "a horrible smell like
very rotten meat. The bush was
thick and I was pushing the
branches apart when I saw it
about 20 or 25 feet away. 1 just
couldn't believe it.
"At first 1 was mad. But then I
went to awe and then to fright
and I began to shake. I couldn't
stop shaking and then I got out of

there."
Lindquist, who is 6-foot-2,
said the creature, sometimes cal
led a Sasquatch, was no more
than seven feet tall, only "much
heavier than I am."
Heavy breathing
"It had flat, flared nostrils like
a monkey and large wide eyes. It
didn't make any sound except
heavy breathing. It had a broad
chest and it was heaving up and
down.
"It could have taken two steps
and grabbed me, but it didn't do
anything. It didn't growl. It
didn't show its teeth. It just

looked at me."
Lindquist said the hair on its
face was a light brown and"it
appeared to have the mange; the
skin underneath looked kind of
white."
The descriptions of all five
persons were "consistent, they
all saw the same thing," said
Constable Robert Eyford of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
There have been scores of re
ported sightings of the half-man,
half-ape over the past century.
The horrendous smell of decay
ing meat produced by the crea
ture seems to be a common link.

have a look.
"The first thing I noticed was
the smell," Lindquist said later.
Recalled it "a horrible smell like
very rotten meat. The bush was
thick and I was pushing the
branches apart when I saw it
about 20 or 25 feet away. 1 just
couldn't believe it.
"At first 1 was mad. But then I
went to awe and then to fright
and I began to shake. I couldn't
stop shaking and then I got out of

there."
Lindquist, who is 6-foot-2,
said the creature, sometimes cal
led a Sasquatch, was no more
than seven feet tall, only "much
heavier than I am."
Heavy breathing
"It had flat, flared nostrils like
a monkey and large wide eyes. It
didn't make any sound except
heavy breathing. It had a broad
chest and it was heaving up and
down.
"It could have taken two steps
and grabbed me, but it didn't do
anything. It didn't growl. It
didn't show its teeth. It just

looked at me."
Lindquist said the hair on its
face was a light brown and"it
appeared to have the mange; the
skin underneath looked kind of
white."
The descriptions of all five
persons were "consistent, they
all saw the same thing," said
Constable Robert Eyford of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
There have been scores of re
ported sightings of the half-man,
half-ape over the past century.
The horrendous smell of decay
ing meat produced by the crea
ture seems to be a common link.
Mission, British Columbia
(AP) — "To tell you the truth, 1
thought it was someone trying to
con us so 1 took oft after it. 1 guess
I thought I was going to pull off
his hat and bawl him out. I don't
know why I did it. I'm not sure I
really intended to catch up with
it," said bus driver Pat
Lindquist.
He was talking about the latest
reported sighting of "Bigfoot," a
big, furry, foul-smelling creature
that some people claim haunts
the Pacific Northwest woods.
A group of Canadians was
startled Sunday about 35 miles
east of Vancouver on Highway 7
when the creature popped into
view.
Lindquist and four passengers
aboard the Pacific Stage Lines
bus said they saw a seven-foot
tall creature, about 300 pounds,
with a light-colored face and co
vered with dark hair.
Fur suit
"At first we thought it was a
prankster in a fur suit," said
Lindquist, a reserve Vancouver
city policeman. "But people
were shouting 'what is it, what is
it', so I slammed on the brakes to
have a look.
"The first thing I noticed was
the smell," Lindquist said later.
Recalled it "a horrible smell like
very rotten meat. The bush was
thick and I was pushing the
branches apart when I saw it
about 20 or 25 feet away. 1 just
