# Pac-8 championships not without controversy
## 
### 
The first annual Pacific-8
Rowing Championships will be
held this weekend at Redwood
Shores, Stanford's home course.
The championships will pre
sumably determine the West
Coast rowing champions.
Traditionally the Western
Sprints determined the champs
of the West Coast but this year
the Pac-8 schools—led by pow
ers Washington and Cal—opted
for the Pac-8 format sub
sequently approved by the athle
tic directors.
As a consequence, last week's
Western Sprints were marred by
the absence of the Pac-8 schools,
except Stanford. The Card crew,
being entirely separate from the
Athletic Department, decided to
race in the sprints instead of
rowing against Cal last weekend.
Huskies and Cal secede
The prime mover of the split
from the Western Sprints was
Washington coach Dick
Ericksen. He and Cal coach Steve
Gladstone said the sprints were
too crowded because any team
that wants to participate can.
Erickson wanted to separate
the "wheat from the chaff" and
established the Pac-8 competi
tion "putting rowing in the
hands of the athletic directors
where it belongs."
Stanford coach Sam Francis
predicts that this will be the first
and last Pac-8 championships.
He said some of the other Pac-8

schools —UCLA and
Stanford —were miffed by
Erickson's high handling of the
affair and are considering rejoin
ing the Western Sprints next
year.
Nevertheless, if this will be the
only Pac-8 Rowing Champion
ship, it will certainly go down in
style. The format will be mod
eled after England's Henly Re
gatta whereby the top four boats
in each event will be seeded ac
cording to their season perfor
mance, and will draw today for
an opponent in Friday morn
ing's first heat. Friday's winners
will compete for first through
seventh place on Saturday and
Sunday, while the losers will vie
for fifth to eighth place.
Stanford's home course, lo
cated at the Redwood Shores de
velopment on Marine World
Parkway right off Highway 101,
is ideal for this format, being
2050 meters long (races are 2000
meters), unaffected by tides and
offering ample room for spec
tators. A crowd of 10,000 is ex

pected for the weekend's races.
Also, Mobil Oil, owners of the
area, have designed a laser-aided
electric timing system which
will mean the most accurate
crew times in history.
Coach Francis said his major
goal this weekend is to get the
Cards' unseeded varsity and
junior varsity eights in the upper
bracket with a win on Friday.
Back to the drawing board
"Our chances will be greatly
influenced by the draw," he
said. "Should the varsity draw
UCLA, or the JVs draw UCLA or
Oregon State, I feel we'll have a
good shot at third or fourth
place."
Francis also said, "Even if we
draw Cal or Washington, any
thing could happen since we are
used to the Belmont course and
the other crews aren't." The
bridge and number of docks on
the Belmont course have been
the demise of many coswains
this season and in the past.
Stanford's only seeded boat is
the frosh eight, seeded third
with an 8-2 season record.
