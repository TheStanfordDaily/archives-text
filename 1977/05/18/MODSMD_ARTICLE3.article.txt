# Doonesbury creator to talk here Sunday

From the Associated Press
"It's time I stopped preparing for my
life and started getting on with it!"
loanie Caucus said yesterday."I feel
ready to accept the responsibility of
the choices I've made, to face my fu
ture squarely."
And with that firm declaration,
Caucus prepared to become the first
cartoon character ever to graduate
from Boalt Law School at UC-Berkeley.
Caucus is the late-blooming feminist
in the Doonesbury comic strip by
Carry Trudeau. Her graduation from
Boalt Hall, as the law school is known,
winds up a cooperative charade
played out by Trudeau, the school's
administration and its nearly 300 stu
dents.
Trudeau will be here Sunday night
to give the 1977-78 Carlos McClatchy
Memorial lecture, sponsored by the
Communication Department.
The free public talk, "An Untitled
Lecture," will begin at 7:30 in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
Doonesbury, which Trudeau began
upon graduation from Yale in 1970,
first appeared in 28 newspapers.
Today it is carried by more than 450
daily papers and is read by an esti
mated 60 million readers in the U.S.
and Canada.
It started in 1974, whenTrudeau de
cided a law career would be nice for
Caucus, a 42-year-old ex-housewife. In
a spurt of independence she already
had left her husband and children and
had become friends with members of
the Doonesbury commune.
"She applied to Berkeley and was
sweating out the letter, like all applic
ants do," said Boalt Asst. Dean Wil
liam Hill. "As long as Trudeau had
decided on Berkeley, we decided to go
along with the gag."
A drawing of the pony-tailed
freshman was printed in the class pic
ture book, along with all other first
year law students, and the admissions
office started a file on her, which in
cludes an application form, corres
pondence with Trudeau and news
clippings.
Trudeau filled out the application

form, listing Caucus as a 1956 arts his
tory graduate of Colorado College—in
New Haven, Conn.
Since then, panel by panel, she has
struggled through lectures, long hours
in the iibrary and tortuous exams to
make it to graduation day.
"We'll probably call her name out.
After all, she is graduating," said Hill,
Boalt's students and faculty have
shown their fondness for Caucus by
inviting Trudeau to be their May 21
commencement speaker. The
publicity-shy cartoonist, who won a
Pulitzer Prize for political cartooning,
has agreed.
"Usually the speaker is a distin
guished member of the bench or bar,"
said Brent Appel, a classmate of
Caucus. •
