Bomb blast misses Mondale
Madrid — A bomb planted by # leftists de
molished the first floor of the U.S. Cultural
Center yesterday only hours before the arrival of
Vice President Walter Mondale for a day of talks
with Spain's top leaders.
Smiling and apparently unruffled by the pow
erful bomb blast that ripped through thebuilding
eight hours before his arrival, Mondale met for
nearly two hours with Spanish Premier Adolfo
Suarez before seeing King Juan Carlos. He
praised the two leaders for bringing their nation
closer to full democracy.
In a nod to both Suarez and the king, Mondale
said Spain's new leadership "has demonstrated
to the world that the forces of democracy are not
on the decline but on the offensive. 1 think our
people are as excited as yours by the way the
democratic processes are taking hold here."
As Mondale met Suarez, the chief architect of
the king's reforms since Juan Carlos took over
after the death of Cen. Francisco Franco 18
months ago, a radical left-wing terrorist organi
zation said it bombed the American center "as a
protest against the actions of Yankee im
perialism." Two guards were slightly hurt in the
pre-dawn blast.

Labor party loses Israeli elections
Tel Aviv — Israel's ruling Labor party suffered
thumping defeats yesterday in national elections
and the head of the right-wing Likud opposition
claimed victory.
Likud leader Menahem Begin told exuberant
followers he expected to form the next govern
ment. The Labor party has been the ruling force
in every Israeli government since independence
in 1948.
The Labor party, stained by corruption scan
dals and hurt by a troubled economy, was trailing
in most areas in early returns.
Ballots are counted by hand and complete re
sults were not expected until today.
With 18 per cent of the vote counted, Israeli
state television gave these projections for Labor-
Likud members in the 120-seat parliament:
Labor would drop from 51 seats to 31. Likud
would have 40 seats—one more than it won in the
last elections in 1973.
A Labor victory would mean continuation of
U.S.-sponsored efforts to settle the Middle East
conflict by trading Israeli-held Arab land for
Arab signatures on peace treaties.
Likud, on the other hand, is committed to
withdraw only in exchange for a full peace and

the outright Israeli annexation of the occupied
West Bank of the Jordan River—the trickiest
chunk of real estate at stake.
Sirhan wants to talk on RFK killing
Los Angeles — An attorney for convicted as
sassin Sirhan Sirhan announced yesterday that
the killer of Sen. Robert Kennedy wants to meet
with two Los Angeles County supervisors at his
prison cell.
Attorney Godfrey Isaac, appearing at a Board of
Supervisors inquiry into possible conspiracy in
the Kennedy slaying, said Sirhan wanted to issue
an invitation to Supervisors Baxtor Ward and
Kenneth Hahn to discuss the matter with him
personally.
Sirhan has previously refused to talk to those
probing the 1968 assassination.
Sirhan, a Palestinian refuge, was convicted of
Kennedy's murder in 1969 after a trial in which
his attorneys pleaded diminished capacity.
Since then, conspiracy buffs and others have
succeeded in reopening the investigation.
More funds urged for smallpox fight
Geneva, Switzerland — The World Health Or

ganization (WHO) asked for $3.9 million and do
nations of vaccine yesterday to fight a resurgence
of smallpox half a year after the disease was be
lieved nearly extinct.
A report to the 150-nation organization's an
nual meeting said WHO needed at least that
amount to finance search and containment oper
ations in Somalia where the disease in its non
fatal, milder form stubbornly lingers. The effort
in that East African country occasionally in
volves thousands of health workers.
At the start of the smallpox eradication cam
paign in 1967 about 20 million to 30 million
people were infected, of whom about three mill
ion died, in 43 Latin American, African and
Asian countries.
Early last August seven villagers in a remote
area of were the last known cases of the
disease on the globe and the WHO campaign
appeared headed for final victory.
But by the end of August, Ethiopian nomads
had carried the smallpox virus to Mogadishu, the
capital of neighboring Somalia.
