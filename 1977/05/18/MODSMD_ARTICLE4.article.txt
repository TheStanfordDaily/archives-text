# Prof labels Iran trial 'a fraud'
## 
### Frances Draper 
A recent open trial of political pris
oners in Iran was a poor attempt to
camoflage clearly repressive policies
of the Iranian government, Physics
Prof. H. Pierre Noyes declared in a
speech here last night.
Noyes told about 250 persons in An
nenberg Auditorium about his recent
trip to Iran to observe this trial.
Noyes is a member of the Support
Committee to Send Legal-Medical
Team of International Observers to
Iran and was asked on April 6 if he
would attend an open trial of some
political prisoners in Iran starting
April 9.
After the trial was over, and the ac
cused convicted, Noyes reported that
"certain persons in Iran gave me in
formation that the whole trial was a
fraud."
The fact that the government had so
carefully staged a "fair" trial for
foreigners to observe proved the risk

these people were taking to give me
this information, he added.
"I have no doubt about the accuracy
of this information," Noyes said, "but
you will have to believe my word that
it is true." He said he never intends to
reveal his sources.
Eleven accused were on trial for
anti-state activity. Noyes said he was
allowed an interview with the accused
along with an English lawyer present
at the trial.
The accused told them they had
been treated well while in jail and had
made their confessions voluntarily.
Noyes recalled, "The English lawyer
said 'I wish I could teach my clients to
lie like that.' "
"There were actually 150 people ar
rested, not just 11, and none ul the
prisoners were allowed a choice of
who they wanted for a lawyer." Ac
cording to Noyes, no prisoners were
allowed to see their lawyers alone and
their confessions were rewritten many
times to fit the charges.
Noyes said the short notice of the
trial left foreign observers ill-prepared
to detect what actually happened. The
press was used to convey an image of
the defendents as "fuzzy-headed intel
lectuals who had been brain-washed
abroad by Marxists." he said.
Noyes is a theoretical physicist at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator. He
has an international reputation for
being one of the first scientists to
realize the immorality of his work dur
ing the Vietnam war. He was the
Chairman of the Committee for Direct
Attack on the Legality of the Vietnam
War from 1969 to 1972.
Noyes was also instrumental in end
ing secret University research for or
ganizations such as the CIA, according
to French Prof. Ray Ciraud.
The lecture began with a short
speech by Ciraud on American re
sponsibility in supporting the repres
sive regime of the Shah. A representa
tive of the Iranian Students Associa
tion in the U.S. also spoke on political
repression and torture in Iran.
Petitions were passed through the
audience demanding that the Shah

grant permission for a team of interna
tional observers to acqu ire information
in reports of torture and violation of
human rights in Iran. Donations for the
Support Committee were also sought.
The auditorium was hung with ban
ners saying "Condemn Shah's Mas
sacres" and "Support the Heroic Resis
tance of the Iranian People."

Noyes told about 250 persons in An
nenberg Auditorium about his recent
trip to Iran to observe this trial.
Noyes is a member of the Support
Committee to Send Legal-Medical
Team of International Observers to
Iran and was asked on April 6 if he
would attend an open trial of some
political prisoners in Iran starting
April 9.
After the trial was over, and the ac
cused convicted, Noyes reported that
"certain persons in Iran gave me in
formation that the whole trial was a
fraud."
The fact that the government had so
carefully staged a "fair" trial for
foreigners to observe proved the risk

these people were taking to give me
this information, he added.
"I have no doubt about the accuracy
of this information," Noyes said, "but
you will have to believe my word that
it is true." He said he never intends to
reveal his sources.
Eleven accused were on trial for
anti-state activity. Noyes said he was
allowed an interview with the accused
along with an English lawyer present
at the trial.
The accused told them they had
been treated well while in jail and had
made their confessions voluntarily.
Noyes recalled, "The English lawyer
said 'I wish I could teach my clients to
lie like that.' "
"There were actually 150 people ar
rested, not just 11, and none ul the
prisoners were allowed a choice of
who they wanted for a lawyer." Ac
cording to Noyes, no prisoners were
allowed to see their lawyers alone and
their confessions were rewritten many
times to fit the charges.
Noyes said the short notice of the
trial left foreign observers ill-prepared
to detect what actually happened. The
press was used to convey an image of
the defendents as "fuzzy-headed intel
lectuals who had been brain-washed
abroad by Marxists." he said.
Noyes is a theoretical physicist at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator. He
has an international reputation for
being one of the first scientists to
realize the immorality of his work dur
ing the Vietnam war. He was the
Chairman of the Committee for Direct
Attack on the Legality of the Vietnam
War from 1969 to 1972.
Noyes was also instrumental in end
ing secret University research for or
ganizations such as the CIA, according
to French Prof. Ray Ciraud.
The lecture began with a short
speech by Ciraud on American re
sponsibility in supporting the repres
sive regime of the Shah. A representa
tive of the Iranian Students Associa
tion in the U.S. also spoke on political
repression and torture in Iran.
Petitions were passed through the
audience demanding that the Shah

grant permission for a team of interna
tional observers to acqu ire information
in reports of torture and violation of
human rights in Iran. Donations for the
Support Committee were also sought.
The auditorium was hung with ban
ners saying "Condemn Shah's Mas
sacres" and "Support the Heroic Resis
tance of the Iranian People."
A recent open trial of political pris
oners in Iran was a poor attempt to
camoflage clearly repressive policies
of the Iranian government, Physics
Prof. H. Pierre Noyes declared in a
speech here last night.
