Construction oftheTanner Fountain
between Memorial Auditorium and
Hoover Tower should be completed in
October, according to Assoc. Planner
Roger Buckout.
"The fountain will not be activated
until the drought is over," said Buck
out.
Obert Tanner and his wife, of Salt
Lake City, donated the fountain as a
memorial to their son, Dean, who died
of polio in 1943 at the age of 10. They
have been planning to donate a foun
tain since at least 1972, said Buckout.
Building the fountain and accom
panying landscaping will cost under
$250,000, said Buckout, but he said
University policy does not allow him
to make the exact amount of the gift
public.
The fountain will have two vertical
jets of water falling from a top basin
down to a round concrete basin about
40 feet in diameter. Eight chestnut

trees will circle the fountain. The
chestnut trees were chosen for their
seasonal changes including a three to
four week blossoming period in the
spring.
Serra Street, where the fountain is
being built, will be closed to traffic
except for the Marguerite and other
buses, said Buckout.
The overall development plan for
the area between Memorial Au
ditorium and Hoover Tower calls for
adding decorative pavement around
the fountain, rebuilding the entry way
to Memorial Auditorium, and land
scaping a new entrance to Hoover To
wer. However these projects are still in
the planning stage and there is no de
finite plan for their competion or fund
ing.
The Tanners have given frequent
donations to the University since
1946, according to Assoc. Gen. Secret
ary Art Charette, including the
Philosophy Department's Tanner Lib
rary. dedicated in the mid 19605.
