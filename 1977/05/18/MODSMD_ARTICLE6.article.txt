# Emphasizing energy
## Carter tours California 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter flew across country yes
terday to give his young administra
tion a pat on the back and sternly warn
auto workers opposing his energy plan
that failure to save energy could mean
"massive unemployment."
The president, in an 18-hour day
reminiscent of his political campaign,
also was to answer questions from
Southern Californians on a local tele
vision show and visit the drought
stricken Central Valley.
In his speech to the 25th national
convention of/the United Auto Work
ers (UAW), Carter brought up the
touchy subject of his proposed tax on
gas guzzlers, a tax the auto workers
and the auto industry fear will hamper
Detroit's production and boost purch
ases of imported cars.
The president praised improve
ments in the economy since he took
office. Liberal critics have challenged
his economic program.
Gas guzzler
Carter told the 6000 union members:
"We have got to improve the efficiency
of our cars. That is why I proposed the
gas guzzler tax."
The tax could increase the cost of
buying a low-mileage car by almost
$2500 by 1985.
The 40-minute speech to the 1.4
million member United Auto Workers
Union was warmly received — the

president was interrupted about 30
times by applause. The audience was
silent when Carter called for support of
his proposed gas-guzzler tax.
Leonard Woodcock, who steps
down today after seven years as UAW
president to become Carter's envoy to
China, had told the convention Sun
day that the gas-guzzler tax was
"wrong, not properly thought through
and should be withdrawn."
Standing ovation
Carter's biggest applause, a standing
ovation, followed his statement that he
was "committed to the phasing in of a
workable national health insurance
system."
He repeated his earlier promise to
submit the legislative proposal for
such a system, one of the union's top
priorities, by early next year.
The first hand the president shook
on arrival in Los Angeles was that of
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., whom the
Carter forces view as possibly the pres
ident's biggest political threat.
But Carter told reporters on arrival
in Los Angeles that there was no polit
ical overtones to his visit.
"Gov. Brown has been one of my
strongest and best supporters and
friends ever since I've been campaign
ing in California."
Farm visit
Later in the day, Carter toured the
220 acres farmed by Charles kryder.
He walked through the dusty orchards
of almonds, olives and peaches to in
spect for himself the effects of the
drought in California's once-fertile
Central Valley.
"There's nothing we can do if it gets
worse," the president said. "The sever
ity of the drought is something I didn't
understand until I came here and
talked to the people involved."
Carter was briefed on drought prob
lems by Kryder and Red Martin, a local
official of the Agriculture Depart
ment's Soil Conservation Service.

White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell said thefarm was picked for the
tour because it was near the Fresno
airport, used an efficient irrigation sys
tem and was near rangeland, which
Carter viewed from a distance but did
not inspect.
All next winter
If the drought continues until fall,
Carter said, all next winter there may
be "a drastic cutback in the number of
acres that are harvested," with a result
ing increase in food prices.
"What we're seeing here are the first
stages of what could be a national
problem of great severity," the presi
dent said facing the irrigated orchards.
Carter also participated in a tele
vised call-in show yesterday in Hol
lywood. The questioners, who were
selected through ads in local news
papers, gathered at the Hollywood
studios of KNXT-TV while reporters at
the remote locations screened others
on the spot.
Carter encountered little an
tagonism from his questioners but sev
eral reminded him of his campaign
promises and their efforts to elect him.
No tic-tac-toe
Vivian Moore, a social worker from
Watts, told Carter that blacks "were the
only group who didn't play tic-tac-toe
during your election" and said she had
hoped to see more blacks in high gov
ernment posts. Carter, who grinned
broadly as the woman delivered her
comments, replied that bringing
blacks into top administration jobs
was a high priority.
Those taking part in the televised
question session were generally
pleased with the president's behavior
and responses.
"I think he really gets the people
behind him when he does this," said
Audrey Hoffman of North Hollywood.
"I thank God for giving us a president
who is humble enough and who takes
time to talk to the common people."
