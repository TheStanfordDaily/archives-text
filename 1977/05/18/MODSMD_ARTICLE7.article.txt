# Prof defends Albers Wall

Albers Wall "is creating an outdoor room to define
otherwise irregular open space, thereby enhancing the en
vironment, rather than subtracting," said Robert Mit
telstadt, mechanical engineering professor.
Mittelstadt, chairman of the Subcommittee for Outdoor
Art, spoke at a public meeting to discuss Albers Wall Mon
day afternoon. His presentation was followed by a
question-and-answer session with interested students and
faculty.
Speaking to a crowd of about 35, Mittelstadt discussed
both the background of Albers Wall and its approved con
struction site on Lomita Mall in front of the Physics Tank.
He gave biographical information on Josef Albers and a
small chronological representation of his work. Mittelstadt
also showed slides of both the wall model and a rope and
stick mock-up currently standing in Lomita Mall that de
monstrates the wall's dimensions.
Mittelstadt said he wanted to show that the wall is a space
modulator rather than a space destructer.
It was an effort so everyone could understand the issue,
according to Kathy Peters, secretary in the Physics Depart
ment.
"The committee met us half-way to find out what was
bugging people, and there was more positive feeling," Pet
ers added. 1
Mittelstadt's presentation gave a better feeling of the
sense of design, although there was still some question of

the location, according to Peters.
"It's not that we don't like the wall in and of itself, it
should be placed somewhere else on campus," said Roger
Freedman, a physics graduate students.
Freedman said the presentation was useful but added that
"the opposition has not been diluted. Our emotions are the
same as they were before we had this additional informa
tion."
Mittelstadt said he was surprised by the low turn-out, less
than 10 per cent of those who signed the anti-wall petition.
Many of the people were from the Physics and Electrical
Engineering Departments.
Mittelstadt said he was surprised to see so many who
were fairly supportive, but felt short-changed by the pro
cess of administrative decision making.
"There should be a stronger effort in the future to notify
all the people in the immediate future because it affects
them. There is a responsibility to communicate plans," said
Freedman.
Mittelstadt also said he bel ieves there should be a way for
community input and stated, "The community is a resource
in the same way you regard financial donors, designers and
the environment as a resource."
One suggestion at the meeting asked for outside art critics
in the Bay Area to study the site. There might be an overlap
of present subcommittee members in forming this team of
experts, said Mittelstadt.
