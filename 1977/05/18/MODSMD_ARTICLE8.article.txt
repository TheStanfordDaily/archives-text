# Stanford Daily Opinions
## Rally, sit-in effective 
### 
Michael Jennings

It is perhaps inevitable that as astute an observer
as the San Francisco Chronicle would sum up a
rally and sit-in that were the product of hundreds
of hours of petitioning, educating and organizing
as nothing more than a cathartic "spring rite" con
ducted by restless adolescents.
What is disappointing, however, is to find fel
low members of the University community hinting
at similar conclusions. When Moravcsik and
Zasada (Daily, May 12) claim we have failed to go
beyond rhetoric, it becomes apparent that they
have failed to go beyond last week's rally and sit-in
in recalling where and how we have made our
case.
In the Daily alone — for which Moravcsik writes
— we have spelled out in half a dozen articles an
array of arguments for all our political and tactical
positions. Realizing, however, the limitations of
columns as an educational tool, we have gone far
beyond them in an effort to contact people directly.
This we have done by petitioning all over cam
pus, showing and discussing the film The Last
Grave at Dimbaza dozens of times, holding three
separate forums on investment responsibility, dis
seminating a SWOFSI position paper, and simply
talking to people wherever we met them.
Indeed, if it were not for this massive personal
contact and education, we assuredly would never
have gathered what was for these times the unpre
cedented number of 700 people to participate in
our first rally two weeks ago. Although by defini
tion a rally is meant to stir people up, at this first
rally we continued in full force our educational
efforts.
In four major speeches we went to great length
describing the situation in South Africa, answer
ing the trustees' argument that American com
panies can play a progressive role there, explain
ing how we had met and the University had ig
nored the three criteria for deciding proxy votes,
and finally what we as students could do about it
all.
By far the most educational part of the day, how
ever. was our meeting with Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Robert Rosenzweig. To an extent that
most students probably would not have believed if
it were not coming directly from an official Uni
versity spokesperson, Rosenzweig made it graphi
cally clear to us just how little input students actu
ally have into University decision-making.
It is only in light of all this background that one
can fully comprehend last week's rally and sit-in.
Only then should it no longer be, as the Chronicle
suggests, "hard for many people to comprehend
why almost 300 demonstrators at Stanford would
sit in a university building . . . and submit to being
carried off to Milpitas for booking in order to em
phasize their protest against South Africa's apar
theid system."
Only then does all the rhetoric that Moravcsik,
Zasada, and Richard Rohwer (Daily. May 13) com
plain about carry a different tune. The vast major
ity of those sitting in last Monday already shared a
common understanding of what needed to be done

in South Africa, and more importantly they shared
the common experience of having the University
tell them they were essentially impotent to effect
their will through the established means.
Rohwer asserted that "demonstrations thrive
better on emotion than reason." This may be true,
but the only reason we had so many people at a
demonstration in the first place was because we
had already spent so many weeks appealing to
people on the issues largely through reason.
Nevertheless, we neither deny nor apologize for
the emotional element of the sit-in.
Emotion much more than reason is capable of
lifting one out of one's self-obsession to become
sensitized and willing to do something about the
needs of others. Reflecting on the brutal conditions
of blacks in South Africa should evoke emotion in
anyone with any capacity for compassion. And
being told one is powerless to do anything about
an institution which is affecting those conditions
and to which one belongs, should also affect one
emotionally.
We are, in fact, not powerless, but it is an unfor
tunate, though once again demonstrated fact that
this University provides few legitimate channels
for our expressing that power. It is only as a result
of the sit-in that the trustees agreed to meet two of
our four demands, the administration having pre
viously rejected all of them.
Furthermore, we know that only because 294 of
us got arrested, and incurred great personal cost
and risk,that these issues will be given the attention
they deserve in the future.
Unless we work at this structural level within
the University, we are going to find ourselves over
and over again, on particular issue after particular
issue forced to take the drastic — and for us costly
—kind of action we took last week. The trustees
unsubstantiated claims of American progres
sivism in South Africa notwithstanding, the issue
of these shareholder resolutions and the feelings of
the Stanford community on them were so undeni
ably clear-cut that we should never have been
forced to take the measures we did.
Despite the overwhelmingly positive nature of
most of the feedback we have gotten so far, it has
been made clear to us that at least at one point we
failed to be sensitive to the needs of the audience
we were addressing. This involved last Tuesday's
rally in which many new people were drawn by
the reports of the sit-in and arrest of the previous
day.
Unfortunately, the tone of the rally, hastily put
together by an exhausted leadership, was addres
sed not to these new people, but to those of us who
had just been through an incredible 16 hours ex
perience together. To anyone alienated by the tone
and proceedings of the rally, we sincerely
apologize. We hope you will not abandon this
struggle because of our failings. Only through your
struggling with us — in criticism and in support —
can we hope to grow in wisdom and strength.
