## Health plan, Lorence tirade

Health woes
The article by Doug Bandow,
entitled "National Health Woes"
(Daily, May 11) is so full of inac
curacies that a brief comment is
necessary. Bandow warns
against "socialized medicine"
but fails to describe the alarming
problems posed by our current
wasteful and profit-oriented
health care system.
Our expenditure of $139 bill
ion (8.6 per cent of the GNP) in
health care in 1976 far exceeds
the Pentagon budget. Our waste
of hospital beds, surgery, diag
nostic tests, and drugs has been
carefully documented.
Ironically, we are already
spending more government
money per person ($250 per
year) than in England for its Na
tional Health Service. Then we
spend another $275 per year on
top of that through insurance
and out-of-pocket payments.
With all this there remain many
poor people receiving in
adequate care.
Despite the massive expendi
tures in the U.S. "pluralistic"
system, there is not a single mea
sure of health status in which we
show an improvement over the
English. Whatever, the problems
of the National Health Service, it
is clear that the English have a
remarkably cost-effective prog
ram. It is notable that the Con
servative party has never advo
cated a repeal of the National
Health Service.
Now the United States is not
Britain and we must develop our
own health care plan. Actually,
our present chaotic and uncoor
dinated system runs a much
higher overhead (20-30 per cent)
than does that of the Canadian
National Health Insurance (3-5
per cent). It is noteworthy that
Canada has eliminated private
health insurance.
Health care does not obey the
laws of the market place. It is too
important a service to leave to
haphazard and wasteful enter
prise. We can surely find a better
way to obtain more health for
less money. I invite Bandow to
join us in finding a solution

which is long overdue.

Tiresome
Jordan Lorence's tiresome tir
dade against the leaders of the
National Organization for
Women (NOW) reveals that Lor
ence either does not understand
or chooses to ignore the political
facts of life.
Political pressure groups have
always operated successfully in
this country to influence legisla
tion and all of them have attemp
ted to use federal pressure to
achieve their ends. Lorence's
own example of the anti
abortion lobby is an excellent
case in point.
The highly organized, well fi
nanced anti-abortion lobby has
been frustrated in its attempts to
write religious and moral beliefs
of a minority into the United
States Constitution, so they have
exerted pressure on the Congress
to disallow federal funds for
abortions.
In the state of Arizona where a
vocal anti-abortion lobby exists,
pressure has been exerted on the
health services of the state sup
ported universities not to per
form abortions and not to allow
information about birth control
to be provided by the student
health services.
The anti-abortion lobby has
also exerted strong pressure on
the State Department of Health
Services in an attempt to stop the
establishment of a new Planned
Parenthood Clinic.
Leading anti-abortion legis
lators have gone into local
school distiicts where they have
no actual interest and have at
tempted to stop sex education
classes.
On the other side of the politi
cal spectrum, proponents of in
tegration have used the power of
the federal purse in order to try
and achieve an end to racial dis
crimination.
Lorence would do well to take

some of the excellent history and
political science courses offered
here, and he should pay particu
lar attention to the long fight to
ratify the Fourteenth Amend
ment. Recalcitrant southern
states were forced to ratify this
amendment by a federal gov
ernment which had been vic
torious in a war between the
states. Blacks also had been
taught to be submissive, com
passionate and long-suffering
and their long and incomplete
battle for equal opportunity is
inextricably entwined with the
women's movement.
The long and arduous fight on
the part of suffragettes is an
example of the use of legitimate
political tactics — the only way
women could win the right to
vote. And the brave women who
abandoned the quiet submissive
long suffering role to win this
right were subjected to violence
by those who screeched that al
lowing women to vote would
undermine the family and bring
about the downfall of the coun
try.
The Equal Rights Amendment
must be ratified in order to pro
vide legal insurance that the un
fortunate human tendency to
deprive one group of freedom
and opportunity in order to in
sure power for another. The
Constitution will remain in
complete until women as a class
are guaranteed the same rights
and responsibilities as Lorence
has enjoyed.
I am sure that he would be out
raged and quickly become milit
ant if he were forced by the
power of law and social condi
tioning to remain quiet, submis
sive, compassionate and long
suffering throughout his
lifetime.
Those of us who have actually
lobbied the legislatures of the
states dominated by elitest, au
thoritarian thinking want one
thing — equal freedom and
equal opportunity for all Ameri
cans, regardless of race, creed or
sex.

Health woes
The article by Doug Bandow,
entitled "National Health Woes"
(Daily, May 11) is so full of inac
curacies that a brief comment is
necessary. Bandow warns
against "socialized medicine"
but fails to describe the alarming
problems posed by our current
wasteful and profit-oriented
health care system.
Our expenditure of $139 bill
ion (8.6 per cent of the GNP) in
health care in 1976 far exceeds
the Pentagon budget. Our waste
of hospital beds, surgery, diag
nostic tests, and drugs has been
carefully documented.
Ironically, we are already
spending more government
money per person ($250 per
year) than in England for its Na
tional Health Service. Then we
spend another $275 per year on
top of that through insurance
and out-of-pocket payments.
With all this there remain many
poor people receiving in
adequate care.
Despite the massive expendi
tures in the U.S. "pluralistic"
system, there is not a single mea
sure of health status in which we
show an improvement over the
English. Whatever, the problems
of the National Health Service, it
is clear that the English have a
remarkably cost-effective prog
ram. It is notable that the Con
servative party has never advo
cated a repeal of the National
Health Service.
Now the United States is not
Britain and we must develop our
own health care plan. Actually,
our present chaotic and uncoor
dinated system runs a much
higher overhead (20-30 per cent)
than does that of the Canadian
National Health Insurance (3-5
per cent). It is noteworthy that
Canada has eliminated private
health insurance.
Health care does not obey the
laws of the market place. It is too
important a service to leave to
haphazard and wasteful enter
prise. We can surely find a better
way to obtain more health for
less money. I invite Bandow to
join us in finding a solution

which is long overdue.

Tiresome
Jordan Lorence's tiresome tir
dade against the leaders of the
National Organization for
Women (NOW) reveals that Lor
ence either does not understand
or chooses to ignore the political
facts of life.
Political pressure groups have
always operated successfully in
this country to influence legisla
tion and all of them have attemp
ted to use federal pressure to
achieve their ends. Lorence's
own example of the anti
abortion lobby is an excellent
case in point.
The highly organized, well fi
nanced anti-abortion lobby has
been frustrated in its attempts to
write religious and moral beliefs
of a minority into the United
States Constitution, so they have
exerted pressure on the Congress
to disallow federal funds for
abortions.
In the state of Arizona where a
vocal anti-abortion lobby exists,
pressure has been exerted on the
health services of the state sup
ported universities not to per
form abortions and not to allow
information about birth control
to be provided by the student
health services.
The anti-abortion lobby has
also exerted strong pressure on
the State Department of Health
Services in an attempt to stop the
establishment of a new Planned
Parenthood Clinic.
Leading anti-abortion legis
lators have gone into local
school distiicts where they have
no actual interest and have at
tempted to stop sex education
classes.
On the other side of the politi
cal spectrum, proponents of in
tegration have used the power of
the federal purse in order to try
and achieve an end to racial dis
crimination.
Lorence would do well to take

some of the excellent history and
political science courses offered
here, and he should pay particu
lar attention to the long fight to
ratify the Fourteenth Amend
ment. Recalcitrant southern
states were forced to ratify this
amendment by a federal gov
ernment which had been vic
torious in a war between the
states. Blacks also had been
taught to be submissive, com
passionate and long-suffering
and their long and incomplete

In the state of Arizona where a
vocal anti-abortion lobby exists,
pressure has been exerted on the
health services of the state sup
ported universities not to per
form abortions and not to allow
information about birth control
to be provided by the student
health services.
The anti-abortion lobby has
also exerted strong pressure on
the State Department of Health
Services in an attempt to stop the
establishment of a new Planned
Parenthood Clinic.
Leading anti-abortion legis
lators have gone into local
school distiicts where they have
no actual interest and have at
tempted to stop sex education
classes.
On the other side of the politi
cal spectrum, proponents of in
tegration have used the power of
the federal purse in order to try
and achieve an end to racial dis
crimination.
Lorence would do well to take

some of the excellent history and
political science courses offered
here, and he should pay particu
lar attention to the long fight to
ratify the Fourteenth Amend
ment. Recalcitrant southern
states were forced to ratify this
amendment by a federal gov
ernment which had been vic
torious in a war between the
states. Blacks also had been
taught to be submissive, com
passionate and long-suffering
and their long and incomplete
battle for equal opportunity is
inextricably entwined with the
women's movement.
The long and arduous fight on
the part of suffragettes is an
example of the use of legitimate
political tactics — the only way
women could win the right to
vote. And the brave women who
abandoned the quiet submissive
long suffering role to win this
right were subjected to violence
by those who screeched that al
lowing women to vote would
undermine the family and bring
about the downfall of the coun
try.
The Equal Rights Amendment
must be ratified in order to pro
vide legal insurance that the un
fortunate human tendency to
deprive one group of freedom
and opportunity in order to in
sure power for another. The
Constitution will remain in
complete until women as a class
are guaranteed the same rights
and responsibilities as Lorence
has enjoyed.
I am sure that he would be out
raged and quickly become milit
ant if he were forced by the
power of law and social condi
tioning to remain quiet, submis
sive, compassionate and long
suffering throughout his
lifetime.
Those of us who have actually
lobbied the legislatures of the
states dominated by elitest, au
thoritarian thinking want one
thing — equal freedom and
equal opportunity for all Ameri
cans, regardless of race, creed or
sex.

Health woes
The article by Doug Bandow,
entitled "National Health Woes"
(Daily, May 11) is so full of inac
curacies that a brief comment is
necessary. Bandow warns
against "socialized medicine"
but fails to describe the alarming
problems posed by our current
wasteful and profit-oriented
health care system.
Our expenditure of $139 bill
ion (8.6 per cent of the GNP) in
health care in 1976 far exceeds
the Pentagon budget. Our waste
of hospital beds, surgery, diag
nostic tests, and drugs has been
carefully documented.
Ironically, we are already
spending more government
money per person ($250 per
year) than in England for its Na
tional Health Service. Then we
spend another $275 per year on
top of that through insurance
and out-of-pocket payments.
With all this there remain many
poor people receiving in
adequate care.
Despite the massive expendi
tures in the U.S. "pluralistic"
system, there is not a single mea
sure of health status in which we
show an improvement over the
English. Whatever, the problems
of the National Health Service, it
is clear that the English have a
remarkably cost-effective prog
ram. It is notable that the Con
servative party has never advo
cated a repeal of the National
Health Service.
Now the United States is not
Britain and we must develop our
own health care plan. Actually,
our present chaotic and uncoor
dinated system runs a much
higher overhead (20-30 per cent)
than does that of the Canadian
National Health Insurance (3-5
per cent). It is noteworthy that
Canada has eliminated private
health insurance.
Health care does not obey the
laws of the market place. It is too
important a service to leave to
haphazard and wasteful enter
prise. We can surely find a better
way to obtain more health for
less money. I invite Bandow to
join us in finding a solution

which is long overdue.

Tiresome
Jordan Lorence's tiresome tir
dade against the leaders of the
National Organization for
Women (NOW) reveals that Lor
ence either does not understand
or chooses to ignore the political
facts of life.
Political pressure groups have
always operated successfully in
this country to influence legisla
tion and all of them have attemp
ted to use federal pressure to
achieve their ends. Lorence's
own example of the anti
abortion lobby is an excellent
case in point.
The highly organized, well fi
nanced anti-abortion lobby has
been frustrated in its attempts to
write religious and moral beliefs
of a minority into the United
States Constitution, so they have
exerted pressure on the Congress
to disallow federal funds for
abortions.
In the state of Arizona where a
vocal anti-abortion lobby exists,
pressure has been exerted on the
health services of the state sup
ported universities not to per
form abortions and not to allow
information about birth control
to be provided by the student
health services.
The anti-abortion lobby has
also exerted strong pressure on
the State Department of Health
Services in an attempt to stop the
