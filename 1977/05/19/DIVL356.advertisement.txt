New York to Luxembourg for only $410.

other scheduled airline. (From Chicago you pay $458 thru
April 30 and $430 from May 1 thru June 14.) All you
have to do is be under the age of 26.
There are no booking restrictions. We give you the same
service you'd get from other airlines, without the same high
costs. So, if you're not flying Icelandic to Europe, you're
spending more than you have to. We'll give you the best deal
on fares and on our New Horizon Escorted Tours, t(X).
