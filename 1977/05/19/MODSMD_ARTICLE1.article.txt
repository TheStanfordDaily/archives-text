# House stalls action on Hatch Act
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The House de
bated more than seven hours yesterday
whether to remove a prohibition on
partisan political activity by federal
bureaucrats, but stopped short of a
final vote on the measure.
In late evening, supporters of the bill
withdrew it from consideration until
next week after an amendment they
opposed was added to it.
The amendment, by Rep. John
Ashbrook (R-Ohio) would prohibit un
ions representing government
employes from using money raised by
dues for any political purpose.
No comment
The bill's sponsor, Rep. William
Clay (D-Mo.), did not comment on his
reasons for withdrawing it. But he ap
parently believed the Ashbrook
amendment could be deleted later
after he and others made further efforts
to organize opposition to it.
Earlier votes on amendments made
clear that supporters had enough votes
to pass the bill, which would allow
federal workers to run for office, be
come political fundraisers and manage
partisan campaigns for the first time in
nearly four decades.
Supporters, mostly Democrats, ar
gued that federal employes should be
allowed to exercise the same political
rights as other citizens. Opponents,
mainly Republicans, said the bill
would lead to partisanship in the
bureaucracy.
Underlying the debate was an un
stated feeling on both sides of the aisle
that more federal workers are likely to
work for Democrats than Republicans.
'Full political rights'
During debate, Clay declared, "Fed
eral employes should have their full
political rights under the First
Amendment that guarantees freedom
of speech and freedom of association."
The leader of the opposition, Rep.
Ed Derwinski (R-Ill.), said the bill
"would opena Pandora's box. It would
create a monster by returning to the old
spoils system type of government."
The House rejected 266 to 143 an
effort by Rep. Joseph Fisher (D-Va.) to
take out the heart of the bill. Fisher's
amendment would have continued the
prohibition on federal employes run
ning for federal office and allowed
them only to seek state and local of
fices.
No partisan work
The bill would repeal most of the
1939 Hatch Act. That law, an effort to
end political arm-twisting of federal
workers by their bosses, prohibited
government employes from taking
part in partisan politics.
Such a bill passed both chambers
during the last Congress but was vet
oed by then-President Gerald Ford.
Ford said he objected to the bill be
cause "politicizing the Civil Service is
intolerable."
