# Old Union protesters justified
## 
### 
Chris Gray

It has been a week since we
were arrested occupying Old
Union in protest of Stanford's re
fusal to vote for Ford's with
drawal from South Africa. Given
this time to reflect, we are more
convinced than ever of the jus
tice and the effectiveness of our
action.
We have been deeply moved
by the support we have been
given by our fellow students,
staff and faculty. Starting with
the more than 500 people who
stayed up all night behind the
Old Union to cheer our arrests,
the Stanford community has

been incredible. Today, in our
classes, in our departments and
at our jobs we have met literally
thousands of expressions of sol
idarity.
SCRIP has received messages
of support from all over the
world. Student groups at over 20
campuses have expressed the
warmest feelings as have a
number of religious groups and
individuals like David Harris,
Father Boyle, Tom Hayden and
Cesar Chavez. They know, as we
know, that it is only the begin
ning, but a good beginning.
It is appropriate to thank

everyone who played a role in
making sure that the protest was
principled and non-violent.
While we have obvious differ
ences with the administration
and while we feel we had every
right to occupy the Old Union in
the manner we did, there was a
definite agreement between us,
the administration and the
police, that violence by anyone
would not be in the interests of
Stanford or the South African
people.
The administration made the
right decision in not bringing
University sanctions against us.
We feel this is an implicit recog
nition of the reasonableness of
our demands and the justice of
our action. And it is an explicit
recognition of the tremendous
support we have in the Stanford
community.
Our commitment to SCRIP'S
principles has been
strengthened. These are a yes on
the proxies, divestment if the
proxies fail, democracy in SCRIP
and non-violence in our strug
gle.
The trustees did meet two of
our demands. And we feel that
our protest has had a tremend
ous effect on them. We sincerely
hope that the trustees do "hold a
deep aversion to the practice of
apartheid and an equally deep
wish to see it end peacefully."
However, we have yet to see
concrete evidence of this. The
trustees now have a tremendous
obligation to prove their conten
tion that American corporations
are playing a progressive role in
South Africa. Our research, and
the research of their own consul
tant, has shown this contention
to be untrue.
The preparation of the report
on the cost of Stanford's divesti
ture of all stock in corporations
operating in South Africa is an
excellent step by the board. We
think the question of divestiture
will be the major debate next
year and we hope the trustees
and administration will defend
their position, whatever it is,

with facts and concrete argu
ments instead of rhetoric about
their commitment to South Afri
can freedom.
Some people have been very
critical of our action. We ap
preciate all reasonable criticisms
since we realize the sit-in might
appear differently to those who
were not there, either inside or
outside. Yet we cannot grant
much credence to critics who
claim that we acted lightly, for
the fun of it. It was not fun, it was
joyous — and there is a great dif
ference. It was not an action we
took lightly. Everyone of us
looked deeply into ourselves be
fore deciding to stay and our de
cision was based on our com
mitment to principles we hold
deeply.
We faced real dangers and
heavy sanctioas for these princi
ples and we still do. Obviously it
wasn't a decision made out of
nostalgia or spring fever.
What happened Monday night
has changed each one of us. It
was an experience that cannot be
described. It has shown us that
we can act on our convictions
and be successful. It has taught
us that unity is our strength. And
it has given us a sense of the love
that can be found in our fellow
people.
We rededicate ourselves to
ending Stanford's complicity in
South Africa and to doing every
thing we can to end apartheid.

police, that violence by anyone
would not be in the interests of
Stanford or the South African
people.
The administration made the
right decision in not bringing
University sanctions against us.
We feel this is an implicit recog
nition of the reasonableness of
our demands and the justice of
our action. And it is an explicit
recognition of the tremendous
support we have in the Stanford
community.
Our commitment to SCRIP'S
principles has been
strengthened. These are a yes on
the proxies, divestment if the
proxies fail, democracy in SCRIP
and non-violence in our strug
gle.
The trustees did meet two of
our demands. And we feel that
our protest has had a tremend
ous effect on them. We sincerely
hope that the trustees do "hold a
deep aversion to the practice of
apartheid and an equally deep
wish to see it end peacefully."
However, we have yet to see
concrete evidence of this. The
trustees now have a tremendous
obligation to prove their conten
tion that American corporations
are playing a progressive role in
South Africa. Our research, and
the research of their own consul
tant, has shown this contention
to be untrue.
The preparation of the report
on the cost of Stanford's divesti
ture of all stock in corporations
operating in South Africa is an
excellent step by the board. We
think the question of divestiture
will be the major debate next
year and we hope the trustees
and administration will defend
their position, whatever it is,

with facts and concrete argu
ments instead of rhetoric about
their commitment to South Afri
can freedom.
Some people have been very
critical of our action. We ap
preciate all reasonable criticisms
since we realize the sit-in might
appear differently to those who
were not there, either inside or
outside. Yet we cannot grant
much credence to critics who
claim that we acted lightly, for
the fun of it. It was not fun, it was
joyous — and there is a great dif
ference. It was not an action we
took lightly. Everyone of us
looked deeply into ourselves be
fore deciding to stay and our de
cision was based on our com
mitment to principles we hold
deeply.
We faced real dangers and
heavy sanctioas for these princi
ples and we still do. Obviously it
wasn't a decision made out of
nostalgia or spring fever.
What happened Monday night
has changed each one of us. It
was an experience that cannot be
described. It has shown us that
we can act on our convictions
and be successful. It has taught
us that unity is our strength. And
it has given us a sense of the love
that can be found in our fellow
people.
We rededicate ourselves to
ending Stanford's complicity in
South Africa and to doing every
thing we can to end apartheid.

It has been a week since we
were arrested occupying Old
Union in protest of Stanford's re
fusal to vote for Ford's with
drawal from South Africa. Given
this time to reflect, we are more
convinced than ever of the jus
tice and the effectiveness of our
action.
We have been deeply moved
by the support we have been
given by our fellow students,
staff and faculty. Starting with
the more than 500 people who
stayed up all night behind the
Old Union to cheer our arrests,
the Stanford community has

been incredible. Today, in our
classes, in our departments and
at our jobs we have met literally
thousands of expressions of sol
idarity.
SCRIP has received messages
of support from all over the
world. Student groups at over 20
campuses have expressed the
warmest feelings as have a
number of religious groups and
individuals like David Harris,
Father Boyle, Tom Hayden and
Cesar Chavez. They know, as we
know, that it is only the begin
ning, but a good beginning.
It is appropriate to thank

everyone who played a role in
making sure that the protest was
principled and non-violent.
While we have obvious differ
ences with the administration
and while we feel we had every
right to occupy the Old Union in
the manner we did, there was a
definite agreement between us,
the administration and the
police, that violence by anyone
would not be in the interests of
Stanford or the South African
people.
