# Battle for Africa
## 
### 
Jan Van Gastel

It seems as if the West has for two reasons lost the battle for Africa
in advance.
The first is that the Soviet Union does not have an internal democ
ratic opposition with the power to obstruct its imperialistic objec
tives and to restrict the financial means to carry them out.
Second, the West cannot, without destroying its own reason for
existence, unreservedly support South Africa or the autocratic and
corrupt Zairean regime. Proof of morality is, however, not demanded
of the socialist camp.
In how many "socialist" African countries thrive hunger, corrup
tion and black market and police error? But it is not their Soviet
protector who is going to ask them to put an end to that, nor the
capitalist ogre which will have the indecency to reproach them. The
U.S.S.R. can prop up and arm Amin Dada and at the same time
command the esteem of the whole world, but the West cannot sup
port Vorster in South Africa.
An estimated 3000-4000 summary executions have been ordered
by the Marxist-Leninist military junta in Ethiopia in the last two
months. And there has been a refinement which even the Nazis did
not invent: for families to gain possession of the bodies of those
executed, they have to deposit 50 Ethiopian dollars (two-thirds of the
annual revenue of the average Ethiopian) for each corpse, and so
reimburse the state for the bullets used by the firing squad.
I am still waiting for President Jimmy Carter to say something
about human rights concerning that episode.
One could imagine the storm of protest throughout the world
which news of such a nature would rightly evoke should it emanate
from South Africa. Coming from a socialist country, such news goes
under the heading of "African ambiguities."
It is a strong bet that over the next months that the Soviet Union
and Cuba will more energetically prove themselves ambiguous.
Why is the Stanford community so quiet on all the human rights
violations in the west of Africa?
