# 'Welfare mothers' unfairly maligned
## 
### 
There are now 2.6 million
California residents who receive
welfare. Of these, more than half
are getting benefits through the
Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program.
AFDC "clients," as they are
euphemistically called by wel
fare authorities, are the most
maligned and despised group of
persons receiving public aid.
They are the "welfare
mothers," about whom myths
and misconceptions are legion.
These are the people who sup
posedly raise one bastard after
another in order to get bigger
checks from the public till.
These are the so-called lazy do
nothings who watch TV all day
while leeching off the upstand
ing and industrious taxpayer of
this state.
Gene ration
They are the women who are
told to not have sex unless they
can get the men involved to give
them money for it, thus sub
stituting prostitution for public
funding. They are the sup
posedly incompetent heads of
"broken homes" who crank out
generation after generation of
juvenile delinquents and future
welfare mothers.
There is probably no group of
people who are more lied about
and less understood than that
large group of women called
"welfare mothers."
How does one go about attain
ing the dubious distinction of
being a welfare mother?
An easy way is to have exactly
followed the role into which soc
iety has socialized women, that
is, to have been a good house
wife and mother who stayed
home and never got job skills or
entered the professions. These
women are perfect candidates
for welfare motherhood, and all
that is needed to elect them to
the ranks is for their husbands to
abandon them.
'Parasites'
Without skills, a housewife
cannot find employment. With
out employment, a housewife
must resort to welfare, thus tak
ing up membership in that group
of "no counts" who enjoy being
parasites on the taxpayers. In ef
fect, the abandoned woman with
children is being punished for
her husband's act. Or perhaps it
is more correct to say thay she is
being punished for being unable
to keep her husband.
It should be noted that while
women do have legal recourse in
cases of desertion, the success
rate for getting child support is
not high. For those who do get
support, statistics show that al
most all support ends after five
years, never to be revived. If
husbands leave the state, the
chances of getting support from
them are very low.
Another way to gain welfare
mother status is to feel responsi
bility for the unborn fetus. If a
woman cannot, or does not want
to, marry the father of the child,
she has the options of abortion,
adoption or keeping the baby.
Abortion
Not every woman believes in
abortion. The current trend is

against adopting the child out.
That leaves many women who
feel, in all good conscience, that
they must accept responsibility
for their babies.
This attitude cuts across all
economic lines, so that many
poor, unskilled women make the
same decision as do their more
financially secure sisters. While
the latter are regaled as brave
women, the former are scorned
as "welfare mothers."
This is a year in which welfare
reform is a big issue. Most critics
of the present welfare system
want to get the "chiselers" off
the rolls, and limit help to the
"truly poor."

What, exactly, is a "chiseler"?
Welfare opponents will glee
fully point to the case of Linda
Taylor, who was recently con
victed of welfare fraud which
netted her more than $50,000.
But the critics are hard pressed
to point out other, concrete
examples. They tend to fall back
on stereotypes of recipients who
buy new Cadillacs every year
while the children run in rags, or
who receive adequate support
from boyfriends while receiving
welfare.
Nickel-and-dime
What these opponents do not
understand is that the "chisel
ing" that goes on is a nickel
and-dime affair, not large scale
fraud. And it exists because the
temptation is too great to resist.
The welfare mother of one
child in San Francisco currently
receives $273 each month. This
total is based on maximum allo
wances for housing, food,
utilities, clothing and miscel
laneous costs, as computed by
the Social Services Department.
Moreover, these maximum al
lowances are not set up accord
ing to the current costs of living
in the City.
For example, of the $273
grant, only $100 is allowed for
rent. The fact that not even one

room studios can be rented for
this small amount does not con
cern the Social Services Depart
ment. Regulations permit a wel
fare recipient to get only $100
toward the rent. If she has to pay
more, that's just too bad.
Each month the welfare client
has to fill out a form which asks
if she has or plans to receive
money or gifts. She must sign the
form, promising to inform wel
fare authorities if she is sur
prised by cash or presents, and
acknowledges that failure to re
port either of these will result in
the cancellation of all aid and in
criminal prosecution.
Deduction
What happens if she does re
port a gift of cash or goods? The
dollar amount or value is de
ducted from her welfare check
two months from the date of re
ceipt. So what if her children
need new shoes, and she has to
accept money from a friend or
relative to buy them?
So what if she has medical ex
penses not covered by Medi-Cal
and must borrow money to pay
for them? So what if her coat is in
rags? The dollar figure is inexor
ably taken out of her allotment,
because by no means is this lazy,
good-for-nothing welfare
mother entitled to a penny over
her grant.
The current welfare system
does indeed need to be reformed,
but not through the minor over
haul and repair job critics are
suggesting. What we need is a
brand new philosophy and sys
tem which does not blame pov
erty on the poor, and which will
enable the poor to escape their
dismal situation.
Blaming the poor for poverty
stems from the attitudes as
sumed by the rising middle class
during the Protestant Reforma
tion. Riches were seen as a sign
of God's favor and poverty was a
sign of God's displeasure. If the
poor were despised by God, the
thinking went, then they cer
tainly deserved to be despised by
humans.
Couple this illogic with
societal attitudes about women
and you have the phenomenon
of the "welfare mother," that
creature who sucks the blood of
the hardworking taxpayer.

grant, only $100 is allowed for
rent. The fact that not even one

room studios can be rented for
this small amount does not con
cern the Social Services Depart
ment. Regulations permit a wel
fare recipient to get only $100
toward the rent. If she has to pay
more, that's just too bad.
Each month the welfare client
has to fill out a form which asks
if she has or plans to receive
money or gifts. She must sign the
form, promising to inform wel
fare authorities if she is sur
prised by cash or presents, and
acknowledges that failure to re
port either of these will result in
the cancellation of all aid and in
criminal prosecution.
Deduction
What happens if she does re
port a gift of cash or goods? The
dollar amount or value is de
ducted from her welfare check
two months from the date of re
ceipt. So what if her children
need new shoes, and she has to
accept money from a friend or
relative to buy them?
So what if she has medical ex
penses not covered by Medi-Cal
and must borrow money to pay
for them? So what if her coat is in
rags? The dollar figure is inexor
ably taken out of her allotment,
because by no means is this lazy,
good-for-nothing welfare
mother entitled to a penny over
her grant.
The current welfare system
does indeed need to be reformed,
but not through the minor over
haul and repair job critics are
suggesting. What we need is a
brand new philosophy and sys
tem which does not blame pov
erty on the poor, and which will
enable the poor to escape their
dismal situation.
Blaming the poor for poverty
stems from the attitudes as
sumed by the rising middle class
during the Protestant Reforma
tion. Riches were seen as a sign
of God's favor and poverty was a
sign of God's displeasure. If the
poor were despised by God, the
thinking went, then they cer
tainly deserved to be despised by
humans.
Couple this illogic with
societal attitudes about women
and you have the phenomenon
of the "welfare mother," that
creature who sucks the blood of
the hardworking taxpayer.

There are now 2.6 million
California residents who receive
welfare. Of these, more than half
are getting benefits through the
Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program.
AFDC "clients," as they are
euphemistically called by wel
fare authorities, are the most
maligned and despised group of
persons receiving public aid.
They are the "welfare
mothers," about whom myths
and misconceptions are legion.
These are the people who sup
posedly raise one bastard after
another in order to get bigger
checks from the public till.
These are the so-called lazy do
nothings who watch TV all day
while leeching off the upstand
ing and industrious taxpayer of
this state.
Gene ration
They are the women who are
told to not have sex unless they
can get the men involved to give
them money for it, thus sub
stituting prostitution for public
funding. They are the sup
posedly incompetent heads of
"broken homes" who crank out
generation after generation of
juvenile delinquents and future
welfare mothers.
There is probably no group of
people who are more lied about
and less understood than that
large group of women called
"welfare mothers."
How does one go about attain
ing the dubious distinction of
being a welfare mother?
An easy way is to have exactly
followed the role into which soc
iety has socialized women, that
is, to have been a good house
wife and mother who stayed
home and never got job skills or
entered the professions. These
women are perfect candidates
for welfare motherhood, and all
that is needed to elect them to
the ranks is for their husbands to
abandon them.
'Parasites'
Without skills, a housewife
cannot find employment. With
out employment, a housewife
must resort to welfare, thus tak
ing up membership in that group
of "no counts" who enjoy being
parasites on the taxpayers. In ef
fect, the abandoned woman with
children is being punished for
her husband's act. Or perhaps it
is more correct to say thay she is
being punished for being unable
to keep her husband.
It should be noted that while
women do have legal recourse in
cases of desertion, the success
rate for getting child support is
not high. For those who do get
support, statistics show that al
most all support ends after five
years, never to be revived. If
husbands leave the state, the
chances of getting support from
them are very low.
Another way to gain welfare
mother status is to feel responsi
bility for the unborn fetus. If a
woman cannot, or does not want
to, marry the father of the child,
she has the options of abortion,
adoption or keeping the baby.
Abortion
Not every woman believes in
abortion. The current trend is

against adopting the child out.
That leaves many women who
feel, in all good conscience, that
they must accept responsibility
for their babies.
This attitude cuts across all
economic lines, so that many
poor, unskilled women make the
same decision as do their more
financially secure sisters. While
the latter are regaled as brave
women, the former are scorned
as "welfare mothers."
This is a year in which welfare
reform is a big issue. Most critics
of the present welfare system
want to get the "chiselers" off
the rolls, and limit help to the
"truly poor."

What, exactly, is a "chiseler"?
Welfare opponents will glee
fully point to the case of Linda
Taylor, who was recently con
victed of welfare fraud which
netted her more than $50,000.
But the critics are hard pressed
to point out other, concrete
examples. They tend to fall back
on stereotypes of recipients who
buy new Cadillacs every year
while the children run in rags, or
who receive adequate support
from boyfriends while receiving
welfare.
Nickel-and-dime
What these opponents do not
understand is that the "chisel
ing" that goes on is a nickel
and-dime affair, not large scale
fraud. And it exists because the
temptation is too great to resist.
The welfare mother of one
child in San Francisco currently
receives $273 each month. This
total is based on maximum allo
wances for housing, food,
utilities, clothing and miscel
laneous costs, as computed by
the Social Services Department.
Moreover, these maximum al
lowances are not set up accord
ing to the current costs of living
in the City.

not high. For those who do get
support, statistics show that al
most all support ends after five
years, never to be revived. If
husbands leave the state, the
chances of getting support from
them are very low.
Another way to gain welfare
mother status is to feel responsi
bility for the unborn fetus. If a
woman cannot, or does not want
to, marry the father of the child,
she has the options of abortion,
adoption or keeping the baby.
Abortion
Not every woman believes in
abortion. The current trend is

against adopting the child out.
That leaves many women who
feel, in all good conscience, that
they must accept responsibility
for their babies.
This attitude cuts across all
economic lines, so that many
poor, unskilled women make the
same decision as do their more
financially secure sisters. While
the latter are regaled as brave
women, the former are scorned
as "welfare mothers."
This is a year in which welfare
reform is a big issue. Most critics
of the present welfare system
want to get the "chiselers" off
the rolls, and limit help to the
"truly poor."

What, exactly, is a "chiseler"?
Welfare opponents will glee
fully point to the case of Linda
Taylor, who was recently con
victed of welfare fraud which
netted her more than $50,000.
But the critics are hard pressed
to point out other, concrete
examples. They tend to fall back
on stereotypes of recipients who
buy new Cadillacs every year
while the children run in rags, or
who receive adequate support
from boyfriends while receiving
welfare.
Nickel-and-dime
What these opponents do not
understand is that the "chisel
ing" that goes on is a nickel
and-dime affair, not large scale
fraud. And it exists because the
temptation is too great to resist.
The welfare mother of one
child in San Francisco currently
receives $273 each month. This
total is based on maximum allo
wances for housing, food,
utilities, clothing and miscel
laneous costs, as computed by
the Social Services Department.
Moreover, these maximum al
lowances are not set up accord
ing to the current costs of living
in the City.
For example, of the $273
grant, only $100 is allowed for
rent. The fact that not even one

room studios can be rented for
this small amount does not con
cern the Social Services Depart
ment. Regulations permit a wel
fare recipient to get only $100
toward the rent. If she has to pay
more, that's just too bad.
Each month the welfare client
has to fill out a form which asks
if she has or plans to receive
money or gifts. She must sign the
form, promising to inform wel
fare authorities if she is sur
prised by cash or presents, and
acknowledges that failure to re
port either of these will result in
the cancellation of all aid and in
criminal prosecution.
Deduction
What happens if she does re
port a gift of cash or goods? The
dollar amount or value is de
ducted from her welfare check
two months from the date of re
ceipt. So what if her children
need new shoes, and she has to
accept money from a friend or
relative to buy them?
So what if she has medical ex
penses not covered by Medi-Cal
and must borrow money to pay
for them? So what if her coat is in
rags? The dollar figure is inexor
ably taken out of her allotment,
because by no means is this lazy,
good-for-nothing welfare
mother entitled to a penny over
her grant.
The current welfare system
does indeed need to be reformed,
but not through the minor over
haul and repair job critics are
suggesting. What we need is a
brand new philosophy and sys
tem which does not blame pov
erty on the poor, and which will
enable the poor to escape their
dismal situation.
Blaming the poor for poverty
stems from the attitudes as
sumed by the rising middle class
during the Protestant Reforma
tion. Riches were seen as a sign
of God's favor and poverty was a
sign of God's displeasure. If the
poor were despised by God, the
thinking went, then they cer
tainly deserved to be despised by
humans.
Couple this illogic with
societal attitudes about women
and you have the phenomenon
of the "welfare mother," that
creature who sucks the blood of
the hardworking taxpayer.

There are now 2.6 million
California residents who receive
welfare. Of these, more than half
are getting benefits through the
Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program.
AFDC "clients," as they are
euphemistically called by wel
fare authorities, are the most
maligned and despised group of
persons receiving public aid.
They are the "welfare
mothers," about whom myths
and misconceptions are legion.
These are the people who sup
posedly raise one bastard after
another in order to get bigger
checks from the public till.
These are the so-called lazy do
nothings who watch TV all day
while leeching off the upstand
ing and industrious taxpayer of
this state.
Gene ration
They are the women who are
told to not have sex unless they
can get the men involved to give
them money for it, thus sub
stituting prostitution for public
funding. They are the sup
posedly incompetent heads of
"broken homes" who crank out
generation after generation of
juvenile delinquents and future
welfare mothers.
There is probably no group of
people who are more lied about
and less understood than that
large group of women called
"welfare mothers."
How does one go about attain
ing the dubious distinction of
being a welfare mother?
An easy way is to have exactly
followed the role into which soc
iety has socialized women, that
is, to have been a good house
wife and mother who stayed
home and never got job skills or
entered the professions. These
women are perfect candidates
for welfare motherhood, and all
that is needed to elect them to
the ranks is for their husbands to
abandon them.
'Parasites'
Without skills, a housewife
cannot find employment. With
out employment, a housewife
must resort to welfare, thus tak
ing up membership in that group
of "no counts" who enjoy being
parasites on the taxpayers. In ef
fect, the abandoned woman with
children is being punished for
her husband's act. Or perhaps it
is more correct to say thay she is
being punished for being unable
to keep her husband.
It should be noted that while
women do have legal recourse in
cases of desertion, the success
rate for getting child support is
not high. For those who do get
support, statistics show that al
most all support ends after five
years, never to be revived. If
husbands leave the state, the
chances of getting support from
them are very low.
