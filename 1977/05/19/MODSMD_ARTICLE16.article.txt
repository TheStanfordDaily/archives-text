# Soft drink spokesmen ask for saccharin ban repeal
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Spokesmen for the diet
soft drink industry and the American Diabetes As
sociation appealed to the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) yesterday to withdraw its plan
to ban saccharin from food and beverages.
Bernard Oser, testifying for the Calorie Control
Council, an industry group, said scientific studies
showing saccharin causes bladder cancer in
laboratory rats are inconclusive. The FDA should
await further tests before banning the artificial
sweetener as a food additive, he argued.
Two Kansas City, Mo., pediatricians and a pa
rent of a diabetic teenager testified that children
with diabetes depend heavily on diet sodas, foods
and chewing gum and taking away their saccharin
products would be dangerous.
The FDA has proposed removing saccharin from
the food supply in July but allowing its continued
sale in powder form as a non-prescription drug.
Supporters of the FDA's action included Ralph
Nader's Health Research Group, which said scien
tific evidence indicates saccharin doesn't help
people lose weight.
The arguments came at a public hearing on the
FDA's proposal to ban saccharin as a food addi
tive but permit its sale as a nonprescription drug
staring in July.

The plan to order removal of the sugar substitute
from diet soft drinks, foods, chewing gum, tooth
paste, mouthwashes and prescription drugs fol
lowed a finding by Canadian scientists that high
doses of saccharin caused bladder cancer in
laboratory rats.
Some critics had predicted the hearing would
bring a massive outpouring of consumer sentiment
against the FDA ban. Hut it drew an audience of
less than 150 people, with a handful of prosaccha
rin demonstrators parading in the hall outside the
Health, Education and Welfare Department au
ditorium.
Donald Kennedy, the agency's newly installed
commissioner, conducted the hearing.
Rep. James Martin (R-N.C.) the first witness and
an early opponent of the ban, told Kennedy and an
FDA panel, "there is just one significant benefit of
saccharin: it helps people stick to their diet."
If saccharin does cause cancer, Martin said, "it is
so weakly carcinogenic that there is no evidence it
has ever caused cancer in a human being." He
asked Kennedy to delay imposing the ban for at
least six to 12 months while Congress considers
amending the so-called Delaney Clause that pro
hibits use of any food additive shown to cause
cancer in humans or animals.
