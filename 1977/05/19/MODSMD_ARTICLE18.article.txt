# FDA allows ice cream substitute
## 
### 
Washington (AI J ) — scream,
you scream, we all scream for—
sodium casemate?
The Food and Drug Administ
ration (FDA) next month will
begin allowing ice cream pro
ducers to substitute sodium
caseinate, a foreign-made milk
protein product, for nonfat dry
milk in America's favorite frozen

dessert. The change in federal
regulations is expected to be
nefit ice cream producers and
could save consumers about a
nickel a gallon on the ice cream
they buy. The United States pro
duces nearly a billion gallons of
ice cream a year.
The FDA says its new stan
dards are more lenient than the

previous ones adopted in 1964
because they let the industry,
rather than the government,
make up ice cream recipes.
But dairymen are furious.
The new standards "destroy
the integrity of ice cream," says
Patrick Healy, secretary of the
National Milk Producers Federa
tion. "The traditional role of ice
cream as a recognized and stan
dardized dairy product and its
contribution as a nutritious food
is in jeopardy."
The FDA rejects that argu
ment.
The new regulations state that
ice cream will still have to con
tain 2.7 per cent protein, essen
tially what is required now. But
it permits manufacturers to use
any "safe and suitable ingre
dients" to meet that standard.
The old standard wouldn't
permit casein, which in food
products generally appears as
sodium caseinate, to be counted
as protein, although it is, by de
finition, the protein found in
milk.
The new standardsalso permit

increased use of whey solids, the
high protein products that come
from the watery part of milk, to
be used to bring ice cream up to
the required protein level.
An Agriculture Department
expert, John Hanes, says con
sumers probably won't notice
the difference in taste or quality
unless some makers put too
much sodium caseinate in their
products.
The milk producers predict
that's just what will happen and
say competition will force down
the quality of all ice cream.
Government and industry
sources say dairy farmer oppose
the new regulation because
cheap, imported sodium casein
ate will he used by ice cream
makers instead of the more ex
pensive, U.S.-made nonfat dry
milk.
The new regulations, which
become effective June 13, also
will require ice cream labels to
contain a list of ingredients, so
consumers will know what they
are eating. If the icecream tastes
different, look at the label.

The FDA rejects that argu
ment.
The new regulations state that
ice cream will still have to con
tain 2.7 per cent protein, essen
tially what is required now. But
it permits manufacturers to use
any "safe and suitable ingre
dients" to meet that standard.
The old standard wouldn't
permit casein, which in food
products generally appears as
sodium caseinate, to be counted
as protein, although it is, by de
finition, the protein found in
milk.
The new standardsalso permit

increased use of whey solids, the
high protein products that come
from the watery part of milk, to
be used to bring ice cream up to
the required protein level.
An Agriculture Department
expert, John Hanes, says con
sumers probably won't notice
the difference in taste or quality
unless some makers put too
much sodium caseinate in their
products.
The milk producers predict
that's just what will happen and
say competition will force down
the quality of all ice cream.
Government and industry
sources say dairy farmer oppose
the new regulation because
cheap, imported sodium casein
ate will he used by ice cream
makers instead of the more ex
pensive, U.S.-made nonfat dry
milk.
The new regulations, which
become effective June 13, also
will require ice cream labels to
contain a list of ingredients, so
consumers will know what they
are eating. If the icecream tastes
different, look at the label.
