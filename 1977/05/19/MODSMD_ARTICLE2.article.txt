Some 1200 alumni will be on cam
pus Sunday doing exercises, solving
problems by computer and touring the
School of Education, among other ac
tivities.
The occasion is the 45th annual
Stanford Campus Conference. The
conference is a one-day academic open
house sponsored by the Alumni As
sociation to which all alumni and the
public are invited, according to Ram
say McGee, administrative assistant of
the Alumni Association.
Students are also invited, but there
is no particular student rate, she ad
ded. The idea is to "give an opportun
ity for alumni and the community to
come and have a one-day class from
some top professors at Stanford.
"We try to keep up with popular pro
fessors and good speakers as well as
issues that are really relevant."
Out of the nine mirti-courses to be
offered in this year's conference, solar
energy, holistic medicine, a healthier
heart and the impact of technology are
some of the most popular, McGee ad
ded.
The co-authors of Other Homes and
Garbage, civil engineering lecturer
Gilbert Masters and Acting Asst.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Harry
Whitehouse, will lead the "Who
Turned off the Natural Gas? or how I
Learned to Love Solar Energy" lecture.
The co-founders of the solar engineer
ing firm Pacific Sun, Inc. will discuss
potential uses of solar energy.
There will be two morning lectures
by fames Fadiman, lecturer in design
in the Mechanical Engineering De
partment and director of the Institute
of Noetic Sciences, on treating the
whole body and psyche for a specific

complaint. The afternoon program
will include a demonstration of the
basic exercises for pain and weight
control and vision improvement.
During the afternoon portion of the
"Earthquakes, Energy and Environ
mental Problem Solving" lecture, the
audience will go to the computer
center to attempt to solve an environ
mental problem by computer.
Many alumni have preregistered for
one of the nine mini-courses to be held
in various rooms over campus on Sun
day. Each course is divided into three
parts, with lectures in the morning and
afternoon. All the speakers are profes
sors here or are affiliated with the Uni
versity, McGee said.
The participants are among some
100,000 alumni world wide. But the
event is publicized most in the Bay
Area, since the conference is just a
one-day affair, McGee added.
Other mini-courses scheduled in
clude "Responses to a Revolutionary
World: Truman, Eisenhower and Ken
nedy," taught by Barton Bernstein, as
sociate professor of history;
"Feminism in America: Some Con
temporary Insights," taught by three
women professors who are active in
the Center for Research on Women
here.
In addition "The Patients' Bill of
Rights" will be presented by the Medi
cal School and"The Impact of
Technology: A New Perspective" will
be taught by three engineering profes
sors.

Met" will focus on educational finance
and the current "pessimism" in educa
tion and will be presented by two pro
fessors of education.
