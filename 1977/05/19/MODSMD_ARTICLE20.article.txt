# Luxurious Orient Express makes final trip to Istanbul
## 
### 
Paris (AP) — At five minutes
to midnight, the glamor
shrouded Direct Orient Express
pulls out of the Care de Lyon sta
tion in Paris for the last time on
its 1900-mile journey to Istan
bul.
For nearly 90 years, the
luxurious sleeping cars of the
Paris-Istanbul express carried
their reputation for international
intrigue, espionage, big time
crime and high society passen
gers like a unique badge of dis

tinction.
Between two world wars, the
train that crossed six nations on
its transcontinental journey was
described as "the king of trains
and the train of kings."
In the days before scheduled
airlines, crowned heads of the
Balkan states occasionally
traveled in special cars, and dip
lomatic couriers occasionally
reported attempts to tamper with
their top-secret bags.
But the train's reputation was
partly a myth, fed by a string of
novels, films and plays such as
Agatha Christie's Murder on the
Orient Express.
In reality, the sleeping car pas
sengers often were businessmen
and hardly more glamorous than
the first-class passengers on to
day's airlines. The Direct Orient
was not even Europe's longest
scheduled train service—the
surviving Paris-Moscow express
beat it by more than 200 miles.
It was the airplane that killed
the Paris-Istanbul line..
A single first-class sleeper tic
ket for the 2V2-day journey cost
$375, some $50 more than a
first-class ticket for the three
hour trip by air. Meals in the
elegant dining cars were not in

eluded in the fare.
"For years now, the sleeping
cars and coaches of the Direct
Orient have been running almost
empty on their long journey
through Yugoslavia, Bulgaria
and Turkey," said a spokesman
for the state-owned French rail
road system.
Under agreements among
European railroads, each coun
try pays time-plus-distance fees
for foreign railroad cars that
travel on its lines. This meant
that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and
Turkey were paying heavy fees
to the French railroad administ
ration for the French-owned cars
of the Orient Expressand getting
little in return.
Last year, the three East Euro
pean railroads said they would
pay no longer. The decision
meant the doom of the Orient
Express, as it may soon doom
other long-distance trains in
Europe that are only marginally
profitable.
The Direct Orient was run on
alternate days to Istanbul and
Athens. The Paris-Athens con
nection is being maintained
with a new train connecting in
the heel of Italy with a ferry to
the Greek port of Patras.

Paris (AP) — At five minutes
to midnight, the glamor
shrouded Direct Orient Express
pulls out of the Care de Lyon sta
tion in Paris for the last time on
its 1900-mile journey to Istan
bul.
For nearly 90 years, the
luxurious sleeping cars of the
Paris-Istanbul express carried
their reputation for international
intrigue, espionage, big time
crime and high society passen
gers like a unique badge of dis

tinction.
Between two world wars, the
train that crossed six nations on
its transcontinental journey was
described as "the king of trains
and the train of kings."
In the days before scheduled
airlines, crowned heads of the
Balkan states occasionally
traveled in special cars, and dip
lomatic couriers occasionally
reported attempts to tamper with
their top-secret bags.
But the train's reputation was
partly a myth, fed by a string of
novels, films and plays such as
Agatha Christie's Murder on the
Orient Express.
In reality, the sleeping car pas
sengers often were businessmen
and hardly more glamorous than
the first-class passengers on to
day's airlines. The Direct Orient
was not even Europe's longest
scheduled train service—the
surviving Paris-Moscow express
beat it by more than 200 miles.
It was the airplane that killed
the Paris-Istanbul line..
A single first-class sleeper tic
ket for the 2V2-day journey cost
$375, some $50 more than a
first-class ticket for the three
hour trip by air. Meals in the
elegant dining cars were not in

eluded in the fare.
"For years now, the sleeping
cars and coaches of the Direct
Orient have been running almost
empty on their long journey
through Yugoslavia, Bulgaria
and Turkey," said a spokesman
for the state-owned French rail
road system.
Under agreements among
European railroads, each coun
try pays time-plus-distance fees
for foreign railroad cars that
travel on its lines. This meant
that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and
Turkey were paying heavy fees
to the French railroad administ
ration for the French-owned cars
of the Orient Expressand getting
little in return.
Last year, the three East Euro
pean railroads said they would
pay no longer. The decision
meant the doom of the Orient
Express, as it may soon doom
other long-distance trains in
Europe that are only marginally
profitable.
The Direct Orient was run on
alternate days to Istanbul and
Athens. The Paris-Athens con
nection is being maintained
with a new train connecting in
the heel of Italy with a ferry to
the Greek port of Patras.
