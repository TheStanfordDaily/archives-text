## musical comedy/max mason 'Annie Get Your Gun' a high-caliber show 
### 
For those weary of plays with
hidden meanings, twisted plots
and humanitarian messages, 2Vi
hours of relief can be found at the
Civic Light Opera's production
of Annie Get Your Gun.
The Civic Light Opera opened
its 40th season Tuesday night in
the newly renovated Orpheum
Theatre in San Francisco. What
the refurbished Orpheum lacks
in decorative taste is more than
made up for in this production of
Annie Get Your Gun.
The story is based on the life of
Phoebe Annie Oakley Mozee of
Darke County, Ohio. Born in
1800, the champion markswo
man occupies a prominent niche
in our frontier hall of fame.
Dorothea Fields incorporated
the saga of the colorful folk hero
in a romantic plot and in 1945
she sought the help of Jerome
Kern in composing the music for
her lyrics. Upon his sudden
death, the project was turned
over to Irving Fieri in. It was Ber
lin's work which opened in 1946
with Ethel Merman in the lead
ing role. This first production
was a Broadway smash with a
number of hit remakes.
Successful enterprise
It became apparent in the
opening scene production that
this Annie was going to be a new
and successful enterprise with
the full talents of choreographer
Gower Champion being put to
use.
The curtains parted for the
first act to reveal the arrival of
Buffalo Bill's Wild West show in
a small town outside Cincin
nati Charlie Davenport, Buffalo
Bill's manager, challenges any
one in the town to a shooting
match with his star attraction
Frank Butler.
Mr. Wilson, the town's in

nkeeper, happens to fall upon
young Annie Oakley and talks
her into entering the match.
Unknowingly, Annie meets
her future opponent Frank Bu
tler and it's love at first sight. He
sings to her of the pink and white
girl he dreams of marrying in
"The Girl That I Marry" as Annie
fatuously watches. Annie is
shocked to find that Frank Butler
and the stranger she fell in love
with are one and the same.
Nevertheless, she remains un
daunted and surpasses his
shooting, claiming 50 out of 50
clay pigeons to his 49. Charlie,
Frank and Buffalo Bill persuade
Annie to join their traveling
show and break into the colorful
number explaining "There's No
Business Like Show Business."
After traveling a number of
months, Annieand Buffalo Bill's
cast arrive in Minneapolis.
Threatened with competition by
another show in town, Charlie
and Buffalo Bill talk Annie into
performing the special act she
was saving for Frank. Annie
hopes Frank will be proud of her
and sweep her off into his arms
to marry her. Instead, he is hurt
and claims Annie used it to get
top billing, leaving the show in a
fit of anger.
Stubborness
After a prolonged separation,
Annie and Frank are united and
he proposes marriage; but once
again Annie's stubborness takes
over when Frank forces her to
concede that he is a better shot.
Annie refuses and challenges
him to a second match. When
Annie realizes that, as the song is
titled, "You Can't Get a Man with
a Gun," she throws the match in
order to keeps the man she loves
and Frank wins the pink and
white lady of his dreams.

The highlight of this produc
tion is Debbie Reynolds as the
sharpshooting hillbilly Annie
Oakley. The main ingredient
contributing to her success as a
motion picture, television, stage
and nightclub actress has been
versatility, and versatile she is.
Although it was difficult to envi
sion the 40-plus-y ear-old
Reynolds as the 16-year-old An
nie, Reynolds more than made
up for the discrepancy in age
with her youthful air and appa
rently endless energy.
Annie Get Your Gun is said to
be an ideal vehicle for Reynolds'
talent and she was supposedly
Berlin's own choice for the role.
Despite the seemingly poor
acoustics in the garish Or
pheum, Reynolds could belt out
her tunes with a clarity a nd pro
jection that marked her as the
professional she is.
Limited use
Noted more as a dancer than a
singer, it's unfortunate that the
choreographer Gower Champ
ion had only a limited use of
Reynolds in his dance numbers.
It leaves one to wonder what the
true limits of Reynolds' talent
are.
Turning in an equally profes
sional performance was Harve
Presnell in the role of Frank Bu
tler. Presnell had previously
been united with Reynolds in
the film version of The Unsinka
ble Molly Brown, but has been

out of the limelight for a few
years now. At (i-feet-4, Presnell's
presence on stage was dynamic.
Cast as an urbane lady killer,
Presnell's pertormance was ex
cellent. His rich baritone voice
was almost too good to be true
and had it not been backed up by
the fine voices ot the rest of the
cast, it would have seemed out of
place.
Another notable performance
was turned in by Gavin Macleod,
who played Lharlie Davenport.
Macleod (Murray Slaughter of
Mary Tyler Moore fame) was
ideal as the wheeling-dealing
manager ot Buffalo Bill's Wild
West Show.
Contrast
Although he appeared to talk
many of his musical numbers
through, Macleod's voice was a
pleasant contrast to those of Pre
snell and Art I.und (in the role of
Buffalo Bill) and lent itself well
to the overall effect.
Director and choreographer
Gower Champion's magic touch
is present throughout Annie, but
never more noticeable than in
"There's No Business like Show
Business." He has the entire cast
weaving in and out in intricate
steps dressed as clowns, baton
twirlers, lasso artists, stilt wal
kers and even a Chinese dragon.
The effect was terrific and the
audience loved it.
The only criticisms that can be
offered about this play cannot be

pinned on the cast or direction
but on the musical itself. Written
in an earlier age, Annie was
geared toward an entirely diffe
rent audience. With today's vie
wers seeking more out of a pro
duction than pure escapist enter
tainment, Annie is perhaps
somewhat dated. Today's audi
ence is no longer eager to see
male chauvinist Frank Butler as
sert his superiority over Annie.
Indeed, today's liberated audi
ence would probably prefer to
see Annie turn the gun on Frank
and fire rather than see her pur
posely lose to support his ego
and win his supposed love.
It's ironic that the real Frank
Butler admitted Annie's
superior marksmanship and
later became her manager. This
is surely at least as interesting, if
not more, than Dorothy Fields'
adaptation but one must be
aware of the type of audience
Fields had in mind.
Despite being out-dated,
Annie does contain a few poig
nant messages and its humor,
employing double meanings
and seemingly innocent sexual
overtones, is ageless.
Ticket prices are steep, start
ing at $11.50, but the polished
performances rate it and the
overall satisfaction is worth it.
Annie Get Your Gun will con
clude its run at the Orpheum on
June 18.

months, Annieand Buffalo Bill's
cast arrive in Minneapolis.
Threatened with competition by
another show in town, Charlie
and Buffalo Bill talk Annie into
performing the special act she
was saving for Frank. Annie
hopes Frank will be proud of her
and sweep her off into his arms
to marry her. Instead, he is hurt
and claims Annie used it to get
top billing, leaving the show in a
fit of anger.
Stubborness
After a prolonged separation,
Annie and Frank are united and
he proposes marriage; but once
again Annie's stubborness takes
over when Frank forces her to
concede that he is a better shot.
Annie refuses and challenges
him to a second match. When
Annie realizes that, as the song is
titled, "You Can't Get a Man with
a Gun," she throws the match in
order to keeps the man she loves
and Frank wins the pink and
white lady of his dreams.

The highlight of this produc
tion is Debbie Reynolds as the
sharpshooting hillbilly Annie
Oakley. The main ingredient
contributing to her success as a
motion picture, television, stage
and nightclub actress has been
versatility, and versatile she is.
Although it was difficult to envi
sion the 40-plus-y ear-old
Reynolds as the 16-year-old An
nie, Reynolds more than made
up for the discrepancy in age
with her youthful air and appa
rently endless energy.
Annie Get Your Gun is said to
be an ideal vehicle for Reynolds'
talent and she was supposedly
Berlin's own choice for the role.
Despite the seemingly poor
acoustics in the garish Or
pheum, Reynolds could belt out
her tunes with a clarity a nd pro
jection that marked her as the
professional she is.
Limited use
Noted more as a dancer than a
singer, it's unfortunate that the
choreographer Gower Champ
ion had only a limited use of
Reynolds in his dance numbers.
It leaves one to wonder what the
true limits of Reynolds' talent
are.
Turning in an equally profes
sional performance was Harve
Presnell in the role of Frank Bu
tler. Presnell had previously
been united with Reynolds in
the film version of The Unsinka
ble Molly Brown, but has been

out of the limelight for a few
years now. At (i-feet-4, Presnell's
presence on stage was dynamic.
Cast as an urbane lady killer,
Presnell's pertormance was ex
cellent. His rich baritone voice
was almost too good to be true
and had it not been backed up by
the fine voices ot the rest of the
cast, it would have seemed out of
place.
Another notable performance
was turned in by Gavin Macleod,
who played Lharlie Davenport.
Macleod (Murray Slaughter of
Mary Tyler Moore fame) was
ideal as the wheeling-dealing
manager ot Buffalo Bill's Wild
West Show.
Contrast
Although he appeared to talk
many of his musical numbers
through, Macleod's voice was a
pleasant contrast to those of Pre
snell and Art I.und (in the role of
Buffalo Bill) and lent itself well
to the overall effect.
Director and choreographer
Gower Champion's magic touch
is present throughout Annie, but
never more noticeable than in
"There's No Business like Show
Business." He has the entire cast
weaving in and out in intricate
steps dressed as clowns, baton
twirlers, lasso artists, stilt wal
kers and even a Chinese dragon.
The effect was terrific and the
audience loved it.
The only criticisms that can be
offered about this play cannot be

pinned on the cast or direction
but on the musical itself. Written
in an earlier age, Annie was
geared toward an entirely diffe
rent audience. With today's vie
wers seeking more out of a pro
duction than pure escapist enter
tainment, Annie is perhaps
somewhat dated. Today's audi
ence is no longer eager to see
male chauvinist Frank Butler as
sert his superiority over Annie.
Indeed, today's liberated audi
ence would probably prefer to
see Annie turn the gun on Frank
and fire rather than see her pur
posely lose to support his ego
and win his supposed love.
It's ironic that the real Frank
Butler admitted Annie's
superior marksmanship and
later became her manager. This
is surely at least as interesting, if
not more, than Dorothy Fields'
adaptation but one must be
aware of the type of audience
Fields had in mind.
Despite being out-dated,
Annie does contain a few poig
nant messages and its humor,
employing double meanings
and seemingly innocent sexual
overtones, is ageless.
Ticket prices are steep, start
ing at $11.50, but the polished
performances rate it and the
overall satisfaction is worth it.
Annie Get Your Gun will con
clude its run at the Orpheum on
June 18.
For those weary of plays with
hidden meanings, twisted plots
and humanitarian messages, 2Vi
hours of relief can be found at the
Civic Light Opera's production
of Annie Get Your Gun.
The Civic Light Opera opened
its 40th season Tuesday night in
the newly renovated Orpheum
Theatre in San Francisco. What
the refurbished Orpheum lacks
in decorative taste is more than
made up for in this production of
Annie Get Your Gun.
The story is based on the life of
Phoebe Annie Oakley Mozee of
Darke County, Ohio. Born in
1800, the champion markswo
man occupies a prominent niche
in our frontier hall of fame.
Dorothea Fields incorporated
the saga of the colorful folk hero
in a romantic plot and in 1945
she sought the help of Jerome
Kern in composing the music for
her lyrics. Upon his sudden
death, the project was turned
over to Irving Fieri in. It was Ber
lin's work which opened in 1946
with Ethel Merman in the lead
ing role. This first production
was a Broadway smash with a
number of hit remakes.
Successful enterprise
It became apparent in the
opening scene production that
this Annie was going to be a new
and successful enterprise with
the full talents of choreographer
Gower Champion being put to
use.
The curtains parted for the
first act to reveal the arrival of
Buffalo Bill's Wild West show in
a small town outside Cincin
nati Charlie Davenport, Buffalo
Bill's manager, challenges any
one in the town to a shooting
match with his star attraction
Frank Butler.
Mr. Wilson, the town's in

nkeeper, happens to fall upon
young Annie Oakley and talks
her into entering the match.
Unknowingly, Annie meets
her future opponent Frank Bu
tler and it's love at first sight. He
sings to her of the pink and white
girl he dreams of marrying in
"The Girl That I Marry" as Annie
fatuously watches. Annie is
shocked to find that Frank Butler
and the stranger she fell in love
with are one and the same.
Nevertheless, she remains un
daunted and surpasses his
shooting, claiming 50 out of 50
clay pigeons to his 49. Charlie,
Frank and Buffalo Bill persuade
Annie to join their traveling
show and break into the colorful
number explaining "There's No
Business Like Show Business."

was almost too good to be true
and had it not been backed up by
the fine voices ot the rest of the
cast, it would have seemed out of
place.
Another notable performance
was turned in by Gavin Macleod,
who played Lharlie Davenport.
Macleod (Murray Slaughter of
Mary Tyler Moore fame) was
ideal as the wheeling-dealing
manager ot Buffalo Bill's Wild
West Show.
Contrast
Although he appeared to talk
many of his musical numbers
through, Macleod's voice was a
pleasant contrast to those of Pre
snell and Art I.und (in the role of
Buffalo Bill) and lent itself well
to the overall effect.
Director and choreographer
Gower Champion's magic touch
is present throughout Annie, but
never more noticeable than in
"There's No Business like Show
Business." He has the entire cast
weaving in and out in intricate
steps dressed as clowns, baton
twirlers, lasso artists, stilt wal
kers and even a Chinese dragon.
The effect was terrific and the
audience loved it.
The only criticisms that can be
offered about this play cannot be

pinned on the cast or direction
but on the musical itself. Written
in an earlier age, Annie was
geared toward an entirely diffe
rent audience. With today's vie
wers seeking more out of a pro
duction than pure escapist enter
tainment, Annie is perhaps
somewhat dated. Today's audi
ence is no longer eager to see
male chauvinist Frank Butler as
sert his superiority over Annie.
Indeed, today's liberated audi
ence would probably prefer to
see Annie turn the gun on Frank
and fire rather than see her pur
posely lose to support his ego
and win his supposed love.
It's ironic that the real Frank
Butler admitted Annie's
superior marksmanship and
later became her manager. This
is surely at least as interesting, if
not more, than Dorothy Fields'
adaptation but one must be
aware of the type of audience
Fields had in mind.
Despite being out-dated,
Annie does contain a few poig
nant messages and its humor,
employing double meanings
and seemingly innocent sexual
overtones, is ageless.
Ticket prices are steep, start
ing at $11.50, but the polished
performances rate it and the
overall satisfaction is worth it.
Annie Get Your Gun will con
clude its run at the Orpheum on
June 18.
For those weary of plays with
hidden meanings, twisted plots
and humanitarian messages, 2Vi
hours of relief can be found at the
Civic Light Opera's production
of Annie Get Your Gun.
The Civic Light Opera opened
its 40th season Tuesday night in
the newly renovated Orpheum
Theatre in San Francisco. What
the refurbished Orpheum lacks
in decorative taste is more than
made up for in this production of
Annie Get Your Gun.
The story is based on the life of
Phoebe Annie Oakley Mozee of
Darke County, Ohio. Born in
1800, the champion markswo
man occupies a prominent niche
in our frontier hall of fame.
Dorothea Fields incorporated
the saga of the colorful folk hero
in a romantic plot and in 1945
she sought the help of Jerome
Kern in composing the music for
her lyrics. Upon his sudden
death, the project was turned
over to Irving Fieri in. It was Ber
lin's work which opened in 1946
with Ethel Merman in the lead
ing role. This first production
was a Broadway smash with a
number of hit remakes.
Successful enterprise
It became apparent in the
opening scene production that
this Annie was going to be a new
and successful enterprise with
the full talents of choreographer
Gower Champion being put to
use.
The curtains parted for the
first act to reveal the arrival of
Buffalo Bill's Wild West show in
a small town outside Cincin
nati Charlie Davenport, Buffalo
Bill's manager, challenges any
one in the town to a shooting
match with his star attraction
Frank Butler.
Mr. Wilson, the town's in

nkeeper, happens to fall upon
young Annie Oakley and talks
her into entering the match.
Unknowingly, Annie meets
her future opponent Frank Bu
tler and it's love at first sight. He
sings to her of the pink and white
girl he dreams of marrying in
"The Girl That I Marry" as Annie
fatuously watches. Annie is
shocked to find that Frank Butler
and the stranger she fell in love
with are one and the same.
Nevertheless, she remains un
daunted and surpasses his
shooting, claiming 50 out of 50
clay pigeons to his 49. Charlie,
Frank and Buffalo Bill persuade
Annie to join their traveling
show and break into the colorful
number explaining "There's No
Business Like Show Business."
After traveling a number of
months, Annieand Buffalo Bill's
cast arrive in Minneapolis.
Threatened with competition by
another show in town, Charlie
and Buffalo Bill talk Annie into
performing the special act she
was saving for Frank. Annie
hopes Frank will be proud of her
and sweep her off into his arms
to marry her. Instead, he is hurt
and claims Annie used it to get
top billing, leaving the show in a
fit of anger.
Stubborness
After a prolonged separation,
Annie and Frank are united and
he proposes marriage; but once
again Annie's stubborness takes
over when Frank forces her to
concede that he is a better shot.
Annie refuses and challenges
him to a second match. When
Annie realizes that, as the song is
titled, "You Can't Get a Man with
a Gun," she throws the match in
order to keeps the man she loves
and Frank wins the pink and
white lady of his dreams.

The highlight of this produc
tion is Debbie Reynolds as the
sharpshooting hillbilly Annie
Oakley. The main ingredient
contributing to her success as a
motion picture, television, stage
and nightclub actress has been
versatility, and versatile she is.
Although it was difficult to envi
sion the 40-plus-y ear-old
Reynolds as the 16-year-old An
nie, Reynolds more than made
up for the discrepancy in age
with her youthful air and appa
rently endless energy.
Annie Get Your Gun is said to
be an ideal vehicle for Reynolds'
talent and she was supposedly
Berlin's own choice for the role.
Despite the seemingly poor
acoustics in the garish Or
pheum, Reynolds could belt out
her tunes with a clarity a nd pro
jection that marked her as the
professional she is.
Limited use
Noted more as a dancer than a
singer, it's unfortunate that the
choreographer Gower Champ
ion had only a limited use of
Reynolds in his dance numbers.
It leaves one to wonder what the
true limits of Reynolds' talent
are.
Turning in an equally profes
sional performance was Harve
Presnell in the role of Frank Bu
tler. Presnell had previously
been united with Reynolds in
the film version of The Unsinka
ble Molly Brown, but has been

out of the limelight for a few
years now. At (i-feet-4, Presnell's
presence on stage was dynamic.
Cast as an urbane lady killer,
Presnell's pertormance was ex
cellent. His rich baritone voice
was almost too good to be true
and had it not been backed up by
the fine voices ot the rest of the
cast, it would have seemed out of
