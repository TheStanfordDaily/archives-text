## An amusing 'Country Wife' 
### 
cuck'old (kuk'old).n. The husband of
an unfaithful wife, cuck'old, v.t. To
make a cuckold of (a husband).
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre is presently performing
William Wycherly's restoration
comedy, The Country Wife. The
play, written in 1675, revolves
around a lewd cuckolder, aptly
named Mr. Horner (alluding to
the myth that cuckolds grow
horns). Horner has spread
rumors of his impotence
throughout London. Jealous
husbands, convinced of
Horner's harmlessness, leave
their "honorable" wives in his
care. In his guise as eunuch
Horner has freedom into both the
minds and the beds of "the virt
uous gang." — Lady Fidget,
Dainty Fidget, and Mrs.
Squeamish. Horner also seduces
a country wife, Margery Pin
chwife, but soon regrets it when
Margery naively tries casting off
her husband so that she can
marry Horner.
Wycherly's play is laden with
puns, innuendos and scheming.
Guest director Michael Addison
couples physical jokes with ver
bal, giving the twentieth century
audience a better understanding
of the seventeenth century
quips. The production presents
the audience with such a wide
range of humor that at almost
any given moment somebody
can be found laughing.
The Country Wife is a long
play with multiple exits, entr
ances and scenes. Addison cuts
the prologue and epilogue, as
well as a few non-essential but
clever lines. He deals with the
numerous scene changes by
using a single set.
Fruit
The set, designed by Gene
Chesley, consists of brown and
yellow screens with garlands of
gold spray-painted plastic
grapes and pears in the
background, and two benches in
the foreground. The stag horns
mounted on the center screen are
an unnecessarily blatent remin
der of the cuckoldry. While

Chesley's set suffices, it is unim
aginative and dull.
The spirit of the Berkeley
troupe compensates for the set.
The actors retain their energy
through the five lengthy acts.
Horner (Rick Cosoria) placates
the London husbands while kis
sing their wives. His facial ex
pressions are often funnier than
his dialogue. The country wife,
Margery (Alice Rorvik), occa
sionally seems too simple, but
her artless and sincere writing of
a love letter is one of the most
entertaining scenes in the pro
duction.
Sir Jasper Fidget's (Rick
Johnson) friendly and intelligent
manner endear him even though
he constantly ignores his wife in
favor of business (and sub
sequently is cuckolded). Lady
Fidget (Anne Swift) is his wiggly
wife — she squirms with feigned
shock at verbal lewdness, and
squirms with delight at the
chance for personal licentious
ness.
Virtue
Miss Althea (Linda Johnson) is
Lady Fidget's antithesis. As the
only truly virtuous woman in the
play, she carries her honor a lit
tle too far by almost marrying
Mr. Sparkish (Dale Elliot). Her
betrothed (or betrolled), a
foolish, foppish ninny, lets other
men make advances on Alithea
as he believes that only country
bumpkins are prone to jealousy.
Sparkish is attired in yellow
and orange, as clownlike as his
manner. All the costumes, in
cluding the ladies' elaborate
dresses, are well-made, espe
cially considering designer Les
ley Shannal's small budget. The
colorful clothes helped brighten
Chesley's lifeless stage.
The make-up, stark whites,
reds, and black, looks strange to
a modern audience, but is only
as artificial as the characters. A
Quack (Shelly Lipkin) is suc
cessfully transformed into a de
crepit, decaying old man. On oc
casion the lighting plays havoc
with the make-up. At one point,

dark blotches show under Miss
Alithea's eyes. Otherwise, how
ever, the lighting, by Matthew
Cohen, consists only of black
outs at the ends of scenes.
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre, on College Avenue, is
very small and intimate. Ber
keley's casual and warm atmos
phere infects the theatre troupe
and audience. Despite a deficit
of technical creativity, the
energetic actors accomplish an
amusing diversion in their pro
duction of The Country Wife.
