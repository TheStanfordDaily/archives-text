The Candidate A film con
troversial not so much in the is
sues it raises and the simple
minded way in which it raises
them, but in the validity of its
conclusions. Its theme, politics,
has been under-exploited in
film, and this picture apparently
fulfilled an emotional need of
election year 1972. Many people
believe that the title role, a
natural for Robert Redford, was
patterned after the kennedy
brothers, while others insist that
Jerry Brown was the model. Fri
day evening at 7:30 in Cubber
ley. Admission $1 (Stanford
Film Society).
Bridge on the River Kwai
Lean directed William Hol
den and Alec Guiness in the
famous prisoner-of-war camp
story. Winner of three New York

Film Critics Awards in 1957, this
film never fails to arouse strong
emotions in even the most jaded
viewers. With one of the most
famous theme songs of all film.
Saturday evening at 7:45 and
10:30. Admission $1 (Law
School Film Society).
Dr. Zhivago Another peren
nial success at the box office,
Zhivago is either sweepingly
romantic or cruelly slow, de
pending on one's disposition.
Lean directed the three-hour
plus epic which traces a doom
ed love affair through a world
war and a revolution. Omar
Shariff and Julie Christie give it
everything they have and
whether it is enough or not is a
question of personal taste. Sun
day evening at 6:30 and 9:45 in
Memorial. Admission $.50
(Sunday Flicks).

Der Letzte Mann Sub
sequently renamed The Last
Laugh when it reached this
country, this film is a silent mas
terpiece. Emil Jannings plays a
pompous, aging doorman in a
screenplay written by Carl
Mayer, the author of Dr. Caligari.
Murnau directed. Monday even
ing at 7:30 in Kresge. Admission
$.50 (German Film Series).
Die Freudlose Gasse A very
early Garbo film, and a regretta
ble one. The story is a jumble
beyond the capabilities of the si
lent screen and one can't irn
agine what director Pabst had in
mind when he obscured Garbo's
features with a wall of makeup.
To be venerated only because of
its age. (With German titles.)
Wednesday evening at 7:30 in
Kresge. Admission $ 50 (Ger
man Film Series).
