## 'Lion' carries on Toyon tradition 
### 
In recent years Toyon has es
tablished itself at the forefront of
dorm drama. One has come to
expect a professionalism that is
not to be found in most dorm
productions. Last quarter's
Cabaret was a good example of
this. This quarter's presentation
of Lion in Winter continues this
tradition.
To be frank, 1 was surprised by
Toyon's selection of the James
Goldman play Lion in Winter.
The choice of a historical drama
is a break with the past string of
musical comedies. However, it is
a refreshing break that should be
taken advantage of while it lasts
by all those who appreciate
dramatic theater.
The play is one of the stream of
historical dramas about Henry
H's England. It is unique in that it
is at once comic and sad. The
plotting and counterplotting
weaved by the characters in their
bid for the throne can be dizzy
ing. Only toward the end does
the hopelessness of their in
trigue-filled lives strike the vie
wer, and when it does one is
moved to pity by the forlorn
situation.
Anchor
Doug Bedard as Henry II is
well cast. His voice and use of it
are perfect for the part. At points
he does not take the time to use
the lines to their full advantage,
but he remains powerful enough
to anchor the play The true in
trigue of the character is never
achieved, but a valiant effort is
made toward it.
Likewise his wife, Eleanor,

played by J.A. Marshall, does not
achieve the height of jealous,
cooly calculating deviousness
intended by the author. How
ever, she seems to feed off the
energy of the king and gives an
increasingly powerful perfor
mance as the play progresses.
Both Henry and Eleanor seem
best during the last act when

most of the deceptions have been
shed and their characters could
be played more simply.
The most enjoyable perfor
mances are those of the three
sons who combine to steal the
show. Richard. Geoffrey and
John, played by Mike Ellis,
Danny Newman and John
Chisholm are all wonderful

character studies. Mike Ellis'
portrayal of Richard Coeur-de-
Lion is a brilliant shattering of
the Lionheart myth. However,
the funniest and most marvelous
performance is that of John
Chisholm. His portrayal of the
juvenile John Lackland is letter
perfect. It is a joy to watch him
whimper about stage.
Heraldic devices
The work put in by director
David Barton must have been
truly phenomenal to draw forth
such performances. Costume de
signer Susan Stack-Dunne
should also be complimented for
the excellent costuming. Also of
interest was the use of revolving
back drops with different heral
dic devices to denote scene
changes.
There was one flaw in the pro
duction, however. From the very
beginning I was struck by the
way the story is so often forsaken
in favor of character develop
ment. One sees characters
changing, yet one never feels
they are changing with the
story, but rather outside of it. 1
feel this may be written into the
play to a certain extent, but
nevertheless it conveys a sense
of something being wrong on the
stage.
Still I recommend this play be
seen if only to watch the wonder
ful way the characters are inter
preted and played. However, an
even better reason to view it
might be to see how, with finals
approaching, hope can be drawn
from even the most hopeless
situation.

perfect. It is a joy to watch him
whimper about stage.

The work put in by director
David Barton must have been
truly phenomenal to draw forth
such performances. Costume de
signer Susan Stack-Dunne
should also be complimented for
the excellent costuming. Also of
interest was the use of revolving
back drops with different heral
dic devices to denote scene
changes.
There was one flaw in the pro
duction, however. From the very
beginning I was struck by the
way the story is so often forsaken
in favor of character develop
ment. One sees characters
changing, yet one never feels
they are changing with the
story, but rather outside of it. 1
feel this may be written into the
play to a certain extent, but
nevertheless it conveys a sense
of something being wrong on the
stage.
Still I recommend this play be
seen if only to watch the wonder
ful way the characters are inter
preted and played. However, an
even better reason to view it
might be to see how, with finals
approaching, hope can be drawn
from even the most hopeless
situation.

Doug EJedard plays Henry II in theToyon Hall production oiLion
in Winter. The historical drama will be presented tonight, tomor
row and Sunday at 9.
In recent years Toyon has es
tablished itself at the forefront of
dorm drama. One has come to
expect a professionalism that is
not to be found in most dorm
productions. Last quarter's
Cabaret was a good example of
this. This quarter's presentation
of Lion in Winter continues this
tradition.
To be frank, 1 was surprised by
Toyon's selection of the James
Goldman play Lion in Winter.
The choice of a historical drama
is a break with the past string of
musical comedies. However, it is
a refreshing break that should be
taken advantage of while it lasts
by all those who appreciate
dramatic theater.
The play is one of the stream of
historical dramas about Henry
H's England. It is unique in that it
is at once comic and sad. The
plotting and counterplotting
weaved by the characters in their
bid for the throne can be dizzy
ing. Only toward the end does
the hopelessness of their in
trigue-filled lives strike the vie
wer, and when it does one is
moved to pity by the forlorn
situation.
Anchor
Doug Bedard as Henry II is
well cast. His voice and use of it
are perfect for the part. At points
he does not take the time to use
the lines to their full advantage,
but he remains powerful enough
to anchor the play The true in
trigue of the character is never
achieved, but a valiant effort is
made toward it.
Likewise his wife, Eleanor,

played by J.A. Marshall, does not
achieve the height of jealous,
cooly calculating deviousness
intended by the author. How
ever, she seems to feed off the
energy of the king and gives an
increasingly powerful perfor
mance as the play progresses.
Both Henry and Eleanor seem
best during the last act when

most of the deceptions have been
shed and their characters could
be played more simply.
The most enjoyable perfor
mances are those of the three
sons who combine to steal the
show. Richard. Geoffrey and
John, played by Mike Ellis,
Danny Newman and John
Chisholm are all wonderful

character studies. Mike Ellis'
portrayal of Richard Coeur-de-
Lion is a brilliant shattering of
the Lionheart myth. However,
the funniest and most marvelous
performance is that of John
Chisholm. His portrayal of the
juvenile John Lackland is letter
perfect. It is a joy to watch him
whimper about stage.
