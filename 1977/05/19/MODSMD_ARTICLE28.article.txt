## Vintage jazz uncorked in new releases 
### 
The music of Water Babies be
longs to another decade and a
group of musicians who dis
banded years ago, but only the
rarest vintage wines could mel
low so deliciously with age.
Now that Miles Davis has hit a
dead spot (he has been silent for
almost two years), his producer,
Teo Macero, deserves credit tor
good timing for keeping these
recordings unreleased since the
late '60s.
Stylistically this record di
vided neatly into halves. The
first side, 20 sharply focused
minutes, features the mid-60s

Davis quintet at its absolute
peak. The compositions (all by
Wayne Shorter, the tenor
saxophonist) are sparse frames
for the solos of Davis, Shorter,
and pianist Herbie Hancock,
with Ron Carter's bass and Tony
Williams' snares and cymbals
maintaining the pace.
The pieces of the second side,
which is 10 minutes longer,
begin to sprawl, signaling Miles'
change of musical direction.
Chick Corea (on electric piano)
and Dave Holland (bass) join
what is now a much looser sep
tet. The controlled chaos of
Bitches' Brew is only a logical
step away.
But the appeal of this record
has less to do with chronology
than with the interplay of so
many talented musicians. Shor
ter, whose solo voice could only
weakly echo Davis' when he first
joined the group, uses his reedy
and sinuous tone to advantage;
he has never sounded better on
tenor. Carter and Holland show
that they are the two best jazz
bassists of a generation, and the
still-youthful Tony Williams
plays with such dynamic style
that his post-1970 creative col
lapse seems unthinkable.
As for Davis, he displays the
same kind of elan that could later

let him turn a collection of chat
tering electrical instruments
into an exuberant congregation.
He shows his lyrical side here as
on a decade of albums from Kind
of Blue to In a Silent Way. On
"Sweet Pea" he is melancholy
and intense, on "Water Babies,"
the leader of a gentle bli/es waltz,
and he; bursts out on "Cap
ricorn" to wake the "Walkin' "
ghosts. After one number he can
just be heard growling instruc
tions to Macero; his voice carries
an extramusical fascination, as
if reflecting the genius that
glows through every note he
plays ori Water Babies.

Here is a 1957 jazz grab bag. A
calm and cautious pianist was in
charge of things, but this release
owes its existence to the pre
sence of a certain young
saxophonist. There are alternate
takes. There are sparkling solos
and duds. The earth seldom
moves — but there are one or two
pleasant tremors.
P'restige has pieced together
this two-record set from old ses
sions led by Mai Waldron, a
pianist who still performs occa
sionally. The apparent assump
tion is that any music left by John
Coltrane, who had become the
best tenor saxophonist on earth
by the time he died in 1967, is
inherently interesting. In this
case the assumption has pro
duced handsome results.
Logically Coltrane should
share co-star status with two
other tenor players here, Paul
Quinichette and Frank Wess
' ( Wess also plays some excellent
flute, and Jackie McLean appears
briefly on alto). Trane generally
solos between the other two, and
the effect is like a shot of straight
Wild Turkey between swigs of
diet Dr. Pepper.
Fortunately, with Waldron's
orchestration, the contrasting
styles are put to good musical
use. Together in harmony, the
three tenors have a bite not usu
ally found outside big bands.
Wess gets to show his talent on
two instruments, Waldron to
display his deliberately choppy
style descended from Ellington
and Monk. The combination of
standard tunes and Waldron's
original compositions mirrors
the rather indefinite movement
of jazz in the late fifties — away
from bebop and Broadway
melodies toward something
which Coltrane would play a
large part in shaping.
For now, however, he is

merely first among equal sol
oists, a young saxophonist al
most ready to become a full-time
leader. His solos, especially the
marvelous one on thefirst take of
Waldron's tense "Dealin,' " bet
ray his impatience with his alot
ted space when he has so much
more to say musically. His inten
sity gives an extra sting to these
well-played sets.

A long and productive life is
the rarest of luxuries for a jazz
musician. Eric Dolphy deserved
to have it. His death in 1965 —
"of a broken heart," as one con
temporary put it — cut off his
career before he could taste the
enthusiasm that his music now
generates.
Utterly devoted to his music,
Dolphy puzzled his peers by
practicing constantly and taking
up bass clarinet and flute besides
alto saxophone, his primary in
strument. Because he was un
able to make a living in the U.S.,
he spent much of his career in
Europe playing with inferior
musicians. He left few record
ings— some with JohnColtrane,
some as leader, like these — but
those have been enough to estab
lish him as one of the five or six
great jazz instrumentalists of the
postwar years.
This two-record set, almost all
reissued material from the early
'60s, shows the same virtues (re
lentless experimentation, exub
erant style) and flaws (the lack of
sympathetic sidemen and an
original framework for his solos)
that mark his other recordings.
Though such solid players as
trumpeter Booker Little and
pianist Mai Waldron appear in
some of these live performances,
Dolphy as soloist seems to be
long to an entirely different mus
ical plane. This gap is especially
evident on the recordings he
made with Danish sidemen,

some of which are included on
this release.
Perhaps that is why the most
effective selection here is Dol
phy's solo performance of "God
Bless theChild" on bass clarinet.
The sound is eerily unlike any
thing ever played by a jazz musi
cian. He encircles the Billie
Holiday standard with gentle
waves of notes. The listener can
almost picture him, alone on
stage with his curious instru
ment.
There is a famous account of
Dolphy, sitting on an isolated
rock near the ocean and practic
ing his flute for hours. The pic
ture is one of wistful content
ment, an elemental harmony be
tween man and music that
makes his premature death seem
more our collective misfortune
than Dolphy's. He seems to have
achieved whatever inner level
musical genius can attain; we are
left with only fascinating but in
complete hints like those on
Status as evidence.

lonnie rosenwald—

In Concert once again gives
old George Benson fans a chance
to hear the jazz master play the
guitar with the virtuosity which
marked his performance before
he began doing vocals.
Unlike the two albums which
followed it (Breezin' and In
Flight), In Concert features little
distraction from Benson's slick
guitar, save the flute of Hubert
Laws on "Octane" and vocals
(by Benson) on "Summertime."
Those and the other two cuts,
"Gone" and "Take Five," were
recorded live at Carnegie Hall in
New York on Jan. 11, 1975. The
music on In Concert is cool and
subdued, and all the more to be
savored because Benson proba
bly will not perform that way
again.
