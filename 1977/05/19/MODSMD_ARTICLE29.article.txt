# Buddy Rich in Bay Area
## 
### 
Buddy Rich, on stage, is one of
the most arrogant, loud
mouthed, tempermental, irra
tional, egotistical people in jazz.
And as a drummer, he stands all
alone, practically unchallenged.
What Charlie Parker was to the
saxophone, Buddy Rich is to the
drums: the fastest, the best
technique, the most creative. Es
sentially, it's genius.
Rich is a showman, as anyone
who has seen him on one of his
frequent Tonight Show appear
ances would know. He likes an
audience and, consequently, his
live performances top his studio

work, if that's conceivable.
Rich started with Tommy Dor
sey's big band in 1940 and
stayed until the swing era all but
died out about 1950. He
played occasionally with Parker
and Gillespie but never had
much success with bebop. He
has lead his own big band since
the early '60s, playing a lot of
swing, a lot of jazz-rock, and a lot
of phenomenal solos.
Rich will appear at the Bold
Knight in Sunnyvale Sunday
evening and at The Great Ameri
can Music Hall in San Francisco
Monday evening.
