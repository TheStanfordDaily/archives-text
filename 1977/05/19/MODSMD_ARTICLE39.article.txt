Zambian troops attack resort
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Zambian govern
ment troops fired mortars and machine guns
into the resort town of Victoria Falls yesterday
in a half-hour daylight attack from across the
Zambezi River, military officials said. No dam
age or casualties were reported.
The attack on the town of 3500 persons in
northwest Rhodesia, popular with foreign
tourists, was the first such action since Zam
bian President Kenneth Kaunda declared
Monday that a state of war exists between his
country and white-ruled Rhodesia. The Zam
bezi River and the spectacular Victoria Falls
form the border between the two countries.
Zambia is one of three countries bordering
Rhodesia that grant base areas and military aid
to black nationalists engaged in a 4V2-year
guerrilla war to topple the Salisbury regime.
The other two countries are Mozambique and
Botswana.
The attack coincided with a United Nations
conference in the Mozambique capital of
Maputo that has stressed a violent solution to
the problems of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and
South African-ruled South-West Africa
(Namibia).
Yesterday in Maputo, America's U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young said that Rhodesian
Prime Minister lan Smith hoped to gain West
ern support by luring liberation movements
into bringing Cuba into the conflict. He ac
cused Smith of threatening Zambia and
launching attacks into Botswana.
A military communique in Salisbury de
scribed yesterday's attack as unprovoked and
said Rhodesian troops "have not retaliated."
It said the incoming fire landed in open ter
rain near a police-run Immigration and Cus
toms post overlooking the Zambian border,
closed since 1973.
31 nations ban environmental war
Geneva — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
signed a convention yesterday banning man
made natural disasters in warfare and then
opened three days of talks on nuclear arms and
the Mideast.
The two leaders joined officials from 31
other nations in the council chamber of Gene
va's Palace of Nations for a brief ceremony put
ting an environmental warfare convention into
force and formally beginning ratification pro
cedures toward its becoming international
law.
Massive destruction weapons banned by the
convention include artificial catastrophes
such as tidal waves, hurricanes and ear
thquakes. Such techniques are still on scien
tists' drawing boards.
The two leaders also signed an agreement
renewing a 1972 agreement providing for con
tinued cooperation between Washington and
Moscow in such areas as space meteorology,
environmental studies and the exchange of in
formation on lunar, Mars and Venus explora
tion.
"This is a good treaty," Gromyko said. "It is

connected with the main weapons agreement a
little bit." Hut the Soviet Foreign Minister did
not respond when a reporter asked how long it
would take to reach a new arms limitation ac
cord.
Spying may require warrants
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
proposed legislation yesterday that would re
quire government spies to be equipped with a
court warrant before using wiretaps or bugging
devices to watch agents of foreign powers
operating in the United States.
The president told congressional leaders
that the measure would resolve an inherent
conflict between preservation of human rights
and the need for adequate intelligence for na
tional security.
The legislation, Carter said, has been ap
proved with "almost complete unanimity" by
the executive branch, Congress and the intelli
gence community. But several lawmakers said
they foresee a need for some changes in the bill.
The measure stems from recent disclosures
about widespread spying on Americans at
home and overseas by the CIA, FBI and other
agencies.
Under current law, there are two kinds of
electronic surveillance. One kind requires the
FBI to get approval from a federal judge for taps
and bugs used to gather evidence about domes
tic crimes.
These taps and bugs are used most often in
investigations of organized crime, particularly
gambling. The new proposals do not directly
affect this kind of spying.
The other type of electronic surveillance is
used by the CIA and the National Security
Agency to gather intelligence about foreign
spies. These taps and bugs require the approval
of the attorney general but do not require war
rants from a judge.
Carter's bill would require warrants in these
circumstances.
Generally, the bill requires that the attorney
general obtain a court warrant from one of
seven specially designated district court
judges before approving electronic surveil
lance of suspected foreign agents.
Sudan ousts Soviet military aides
Khartoum, Sudan — Sudan expelled all 90
Soviet military experts in the Sudanese army
yesterday, the Sudanese new agency reported.
It said the experts along with their 57
member families left Khartoum at noon aboard
three Soviet planes.
The expulsion decision was relayed to the
Soviet ambassador to Khartoum a week ago,
the agency added.
An office attached to the Soviet Embassy
which has been operated by the expelled ex
perts was also closed, the agency said.
The experts have been in Sudan since 1970.
Sudan's chief ally, Egypt, expelled 15,000
Soviet military advisers in July 1972.
Nixon: no apologies on Vietnam
Washington — Former President Richard

Nixon says he has no apology for the way he
conducted the war in Southeast Asia, regret
ting only that he didn't step up the military
drive earlier to bring the North Vietnamese to
the bargaining table.
In the third segment of Nixon's interviews
with David Frost, to air tonight, a source on the
Frost staff says, the former president credits the
stepped up bombings, the mining of Haiphong
harbor in 1972, and his refusal to bow to
domestic dissent, with finally persuading
Hanoi to come to terms.
The source says Nixon feels that American
involvement in Vietnam was worth the sac
rifices, although it would have been more
popular politically to pull out of the war.
The United States opened a new phase of the
Indochina war on May 9, 1972, mining
Haiphong Harbor and six other North Viet
namese ports and launching an intensified air
offensive against rail and other supply lines in
the north.
If that had been done in 1970, about the time
of the Cambodian invasion, Nixon maintains,
the war might have been ended earlier, the
source said.
The Frost interview covers a wide range ol
topics: the war and protests at home, abuses of
power, the establishment of the "plumbers"
investigative unit in the White House and
compilation of an enemies list by his staff.
Students occupy shooting site
Kent, Ohio — You'd think they'd want to
forget. Instead, they've pitched a tent city to
make sure everyone remembers.
Tentropolis, they call it sometimes. A collec
tion of 70 tents set up on a grassy slope where
National Guardsmen fired on antiwar protes
ters on May 4, 1970.
The 13-second barrage of gunfire cut down
four students, wounded nine others and made
Kent State University (KSU) a name that still
brings back memories of violence.
Now the school wants to build a gymnasium
annex on the site, and about 130 protesters
have been camped there since last Friday and
say they'll remain as long as necessary to stop
construction.
KSU President Glenn Olds said the annex
has been planned since 1965 and the decision
was "irrevocable."
The students hope not.
Olds said yesterday that the protesters will
not be allowed to remain on the slope once
construction begins later this year. He said he
hopes they will leave voluntarily, but "they
will be removed legally and physically if they
do not."
Carter urges gas search
Sacramento — President Jimmy Carter
urged California to go after all the natural gas it
can get, including liquefied natural gas (LNG),
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yesterday.
Brown described his conversation Tuesday
with Carter concerning LNG and other energy
matters and said he will fly to Washington "as
soon as possible" with other California leaders

for more conferences with Carter on LNG.
"We want to make sure before committing
the state to LNG development that we've taken
all other steps to obtain whatever gas supplies
are available, and to protect California con
sumers with respect to the price they will ulti
mately have to pay."
Asked at an informal new conference to de
scribe Carter's attitude toward California plans
to develop an LNG terminal to receive ship
ments of LNG from Alaska and Indonesia,
Brown replied:
"The president's comment was if California
can get itself any gas, it was his firm recom
mendation that they ought to go out and get
it —that the supplies are short, and the state
depends to a great extent on its gas. And our
gas supplies are declining."
Carter hopes for arms reductions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter told
congressional leaders yesterday he still hopes
for "substantial reductions" in U.S. and Rus
sian nuclear arsenals but neither the United
States nor the Soviet Union has changed posi
tion on strategic arms negotiations.
Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders pledged support for the administra
tion's renewed efforts to negotiate arms reduc
tions with the Soviet Union this week in
Geneva.
"There is no new American proposal,"
White House Press Secretary Jody Powell told
reporters after the president met with the law
makers for 90 minutes. "The president remains
hopeful ws can achieve some substantial re
ductions in arms levels.
"We have presented what we believe to be
fair and equitable proposals," Powell said.
"We are willing and eager to...sit down and
talk."
The press secretary said Carter and the con
gressional leaders discussed "possibilities for

progress" in those talks. But he refused to say
what those possibilities are. "I'm not going to
discuss what may or may not be a negotiating
point."
Ginzburg charged in fraud case
San Francisco — California's attorney gen
eral yesterday filed an amended complaint in
San Francisco Superior Court charging Ralph
Ginzburg, publisher of Moneysworth
magazine, with false advertising and failing to
deliver the periodical.
The suit alleges Ginzburg and his New York
corporation, Avant Garde, publisher of the
consumer magazine, defrauded large numbers
of subscribers.
It claims that advertising offered "free"
copies of other consumer publications with a
guarantee that money would be refunded if a
person was dissatisfied.
Among bonus inducements were a Moneys
worth Consumer Encyclopedia, a Moneys
worth Home Medical Advisor and a booklet
entitled Stake Your Claim: How to Work the
Social Security Gold Mine.
The suit alleges that the encyclopedia is a
U.S. Agriculture Department pamphlet pub
lished in 1965 and the medical advisor is an
obsolete 1953 publication.
The attorney general said the social security
benefits are available to only a few individuals.
The suit also clamims many subscribers re
ceived neither their bonuses nor the Moneys
worth magazine and efforts to get refunds were
unsuccessful.

Zambian troops attack resort
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Zambian govern
ment troops fired mortars and machine guns
into the resort town of Victoria Falls yesterday
in a half-hour daylight attack from across the
Zambezi River, military officials said. No dam
age or casualties were reported.
The attack on the town of 3500 persons in
northwest Rhodesia, popular with foreign
tourists, was the first such action since Zam
bian President Kenneth Kaunda declared
Monday that a state of war exists between his
country and white-ruled Rhodesia. The Zam
bezi River and the spectacular Victoria Falls
form the border between the two countries.
Zambia is one of three countries bordering
Rhodesia that grant base areas and military aid
to black nationalists engaged in a 4V2-year
guerrilla war to topple the Salisbury regime.
The other two countries are Mozambique and
Botswana.
The attack coincided with a United Nations
conference in the Mozambique capital of
Maputo that has stressed a violent solution to
the problems of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and
South African-ruled South-West Africa
(Namibia).
Yesterday in Maputo, America's U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young said that Rhodesian
Prime Minister lan Smith hoped to gain West
ern support by luring liberation movements
into bringing Cuba into the conflict. He ac
cused Smith of threatening Zambia and
launching attacks into Botswana.
A military communique in Salisbury de
scribed yesterday's attack as unprovoked and
said Rhodesian troops "have not retaliated."
It said the incoming fire landed in open ter
rain near a police-run Immigration and Cus
toms post overlooking the Zambian border,
closed since 1973.
31 nations ban environmental war
Geneva — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
signed a convention yesterday banning man
made natural disasters in warfare and then
opened three days of talks on nuclear arms and
the Mideast.
The two leaders joined officials from 31
other nations in the council chamber of Gene
va's Palace of Nations for a brief ceremony put
ting an environmental warfare convention into
force and formally beginning ratification pro
cedures toward its becoming international
law.
Massive destruction weapons banned by the
convention include artificial catastrophes
such as tidal waves, hurricanes and ear
thquakes. Such techniques are still on scien
tists' drawing boards.
The two leaders also signed an agreement
renewing a 1972 agreement providing for con
tinued cooperation between Washington and
Moscow in such areas as space meteorology,
environmental studies and the exchange of in
formation on lunar, Mars and Venus explora
tion.
"This is a good treaty," Gromyko said. "It is

connected with the main weapons agreement a
little bit." Hut the Soviet Foreign Minister did
not respond when a reporter asked how long it
would take to reach a new arms limitation ac
cord.
Spying may require warrants
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
proposed legislation yesterday that would re
quire government spies to be equipped with a
court warrant before using wiretaps or bugging
devices to watch agents of foreign powers
operating in the United States.
The president told congressional leaders
that the measure would resolve an inherent
conflict between preservation of human rights
and the need for adequate intelligence for na
tional security.
The legislation, Carter said, has been ap
proved with "almost complete unanimity" by
the executive branch, Congress and the intelli
gence community. But several lawmakers said
they foresee a need for some changes in the bill.
The measure stems from recent disclosures
about widespread spying on Americans at
home and overseas by the CIA, FBI and other
agencies.
Under current law, there are two kinds of
electronic surveillance. One kind requires the
FBI to get approval from a federal judge for taps
and bugs used to gather evidence about domes
tic crimes.
These taps and bugs are used most often in
investigations of organized crime, particularly
gambling. The new proposals do not directly
affect this kind of spying.
The other type of electronic surveillance is
used by the CIA and the National Security
Agency to gather intelligence about foreign
spies. These taps and bugs require the approval
of the attorney general but do not require war
rants from a judge.
Carter's bill would require warrants in these
circumstances.
Generally, the bill requires that the attorney
general obtain a court warrant from one of
seven specially designated district court
judges before approving electronic surveil
lance of suspected foreign agents.
Sudan ousts Soviet military aides
Khartoum, Sudan — Sudan expelled all 90
Soviet military experts in the Sudanese army
yesterday, the Sudanese new agency reported.
It said the experts along with their 57
member families left Khartoum at noon aboard
three Soviet planes.
The expulsion decision was relayed to the
Soviet ambassador to Khartoum a week ago,
the agency added.
An office attached to the Soviet Embassy
which has been operated by the expelled ex
perts was also closed, the agency said.
The experts have been in Sudan since 1970.
Sudan's chief ally, Egypt, expelled 15,000
Soviet military advisers in July 1972.
Nixon: no apologies on Vietnam
Washington — Former President Richard

Nixon says he has no apology for the way he
conducted the war in Southeast Asia, regret
ting only that he didn't step up the military
drive earlier to bring the North Vietnamese to
the bargaining table.
In the third segment of Nixon's interviews
with David Frost, to air tonight, a source on the
Frost staff says, the former president credits the
stepped up bombings, the mining of Haiphong
harbor in 1972, and his refusal to bow to
domestic dissent, with finally persuading
Hanoi to come to terms.
The source says Nixon feels that American
involvement in Vietnam was worth the sac
rifices, although it would have been more
popular politically to pull out of the war.
The United States opened a new phase of the
Indochina war on May 9, 1972, mining
Haiphong Harbor and six other North Viet
namese ports and launching an intensified air
offensive against rail and other supply lines in
the north.
If that had been done in 1970, about the time
of the Cambodian invasion, Nixon maintains,
the war might have been ended earlier, the
source said.
The Frost interview covers a wide range ol
topics: the war and protests at home, abuses of
power, the establishment of the "plumbers"
investigative unit in the White House and
compilation of an enemies list by his staff.
Students occupy shooting site
Kent, Ohio — You'd think they'd want to
forget. Instead, they've pitched a tent city to
make sure everyone remembers.
Tentropolis, they call it sometimes. A collec
tion of 70 tents set up on a grassy slope where
National Guardsmen fired on antiwar protes
ters on May 4, 1970.
The 13-second barrage of gunfire cut down
four students, wounded nine others and made
Kent State University (KSU) a name that still
brings back memories of violence.
Now the school wants to build a gymnasium
annex on the site, and about 130 protesters
have been camped there since last Friday and
say they'll remain as long as necessary to stop
construction.
KSU President Glenn Olds said the annex
has been planned since 1965 and the decision
was "irrevocable."
The students hope not.
Olds said yesterday that the protesters will
not be allowed to remain on the slope once
construction begins later this year. He said he
hopes they will leave voluntarily, but "they
will be removed legally and physically if they
do not."
Carter urges gas search
Sacramento — President Jimmy Carter
urged California to go after all the natural gas it
can get, including liquefied natural gas (LNG),
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yesterday.
Brown described his conversation Tuesday
with Carter concerning LNG and other energy
matters and said he will fly to Washington "as
soon as possible" with other California leaders

for more conferences with Carter on LNG.
"We want to make sure before committing
the state to LNG development that we've taken
all other steps to obtain whatever gas supplies
are available, and to protect California con
sumers with respect to the price they will ulti
mately have to pay."
Asked at an informal new conference to de
scribe Carter's attitude toward California plans
to develop an LNG terminal to receive ship
ments of LNG from Alaska and Indonesia,
Brown replied:
"The president's comment was if California
can get itself any gas, it was his firm recom
mendation that they ought to go out and get
it —that the supplies are short, and the state
depends to a great extent on its gas. And our
gas supplies are declining."
Carter hopes for arms reductions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter told
congressional leaders yesterday he still hopes
for "substantial reductions" in U.S. and Rus
sian nuclear arsenals but neither the United
States nor the Soviet Union has changed posi
tion on strategic arms negotiations.
Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders pledged support for the administra
tion's renewed efforts to negotiate arms reduc
tions with the Soviet Union this week in
Geneva.
"There is no new American proposal,"
White House Press Secretary Jody Powell told
reporters after the president met with the law
makers for 90 minutes. "The president remains
hopeful ws can achieve some substantial re
ductions in arms levels.
"We have presented what we believe to be
fair and equitable proposals," Powell said.
"We are willing and eager to...sit down and
talk."
The press secretary said Carter and the con
gressional leaders discussed "possibilities for

progress" in those talks. But he refused to say
what those possibilities are. "I'm not going to
discuss what may or may not be a negotiating
point."
Ginzburg charged in fraud case
San Francisco — California's attorney gen
eral yesterday filed an amended complaint in
San Francisco Superior Court charging Ralph
Ginzburg, publisher of Moneysworth
magazine, with false advertising and failing to
deliver the periodical.
The suit alleges Ginzburg and his New York
corporation, Avant Garde, publisher of the
consumer magazine, defrauded large numbers
of subscribers.
It claims that advertising offered "free"
copies of other consumer publications with a
guarantee that money would be refunded if a
person was dissatisfied.
Among bonus inducements were a Moneys
worth Consumer Encyclopedia, a Moneys
worth Home Medical Advisor and a booklet
entitled Stake Your Claim: How to Work the
Social Security Gold Mine.
The suit alleges that the encyclopedia is a
U.S. Agriculture Department pamphlet pub
lished in 1965 and the medical advisor is an
obsolete 1953 publication.
The attorney general said the social security
benefits are available to only a few individuals.
The suit also clamims many subscribers re

Zambian troops attack resort
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Zambian govern
ment troops fired mortars and machine guns
into the resort town of Victoria Falls yesterday
in a half-hour daylight attack from across the
Zambezi River, military officials said. No dam
age or casualties were reported.
The attack on the town of 3500 persons in
northwest Rhodesia, popular with foreign
tourists, was the first such action since Zam
bian President Kenneth Kaunda declared
Monday that a state of war exists between his
country and white-ruled Rhodesia. The Zam
bezi River and the spectacular Victoria Falls
form the border between the two countries.
Zambia is one of three countries bordering
Rhodesia that grant base areas and military aid
to black nationalists engaged in a 4V2-year
guerrilla war to topple the Salisbury regime.
The other two countries are Mozambique and
Botswana.
The attack coincided with a United Nations
conference in the Mozambique capital of
Maputo that has stressed a violent solution to
the problems of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and
South African-ruled South-West Africa
(Namibia).
Yesterday in Maputo, America's U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young said that Rhodesian
Prime Minister lan Smith hoped to gain West
ern support by luring liberation movements
into bringing Cuba into the conflict. He ac
cused Smith of threatening Zambia and
launching attacks into Botswana.
A military communique in Salisbury de
scribed yesterday's attack as unprovoked and
said Rhodesian troops "have not retaliated."
It said the incoming fire landed in open ter
rain near a police-run Immigration and Cus
toms post overlooking the Zambian border,
closed since 1973.
31 nations ban environmental war
Geneva — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
signed a convention yesterday banning man
made natural disasters in warfare and then
opened three days of talks on nuclear arms and
the Mideast.
The two leaders joined officials from 31
other nations in the council chamber of Gene
va's Palace of Nations for a brief ceremony put
ting an environmental warfare convention into
force and formally beginning ratification pro
cedures toward its becoming international
law.
Massive destruction weapons banned by the
convention include artificial catastrophes
such as tidal waves, hurricanes and ear
thquakes. Such techniques are still on scien
tists' drawing boards.
The two leaders also signed an agreement
renewing a 1972 agreement providing for con
tinued cooperation between Washington and
Moscow in such areas as space meteorology,
environmental studies and the exchange of in
formation on lunar, Mars and Venus explora
tion.
"This is a good treaty," Gromyko said. "It is

connected with the main weapons agreement a
little bit." Hut the Soviet Foreign Minister did
not respond when a reporter asked how long it
would take to reach a new arms limitation ac
cord.
Spying may require warrants
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
proposed legislation yesterday that would re
quire government spies to be equipped with a
court warrant before using wiretaps or bugging
devices to watch agents of foreign powers
operating in the United States.
The president told congressional leaders
that the measure would resolve an inherent
conflict between preservation of human rights
and the need for adequate intelligence for na
tional security.
The legislation, Carter said, has been ap
proved with "almost complete unanimity" by
the executive branch, Congress and the intelli
gence community. But several lawmakers said
they foresee a need for some changes in the bill.
The measure stems from recent disclosures
about widespread spying on Americans at
home and overseas by the CIA, FBI and other
agencies.
Under current law, there are two kinds of
electronic surveillance. One kind requires the
FBI to get approval from a federal judge for taps
and bugs used to gather evidence about domes
tic crimes.
These taps and bugs are used most often in
investigations of organized crime, particularly
gambling. The new proposals do not directly
affect this kind of spying.
The other type of electronic surveillance is
used by the CIA and the National Security
Agency to gather intelligence about foreign
spies. These taps and bugs require the approval
of the attorney general but do not require war
rants from a judge.
Carter's bill would require warrants in these
circumstances.
Generally, the bill requires that the attorney
general obtain a court warrant from one of
seven specially designated district court
judges before approving electronic surveil
lance of suspected foreign agents.
Sudan ousts Soviet military aides
Khartoum, Sudan — Sudan expelled all 90
Soviet military experts in the Sudanese army
yesterday, the Sudanese new agency reported.
It said the experts along with their 57
member families left Khartoum at noon aboard
three Soviet planes.
The expulsion decision was relayed to the
Soviet ambassador to Khartoum a week ago,
the agency added.
An office attached to the Soviet Embassy
which has been operated by the expelled ex
perts was also closed, the agency said.
The experts have been in Sudan since 1970.
Sudan's chief ally, Egypt, expelled 15,000
Soviet military advisers in July 1972.
Nixon: no apologies on Vietnam
Washington — Former President Richard

Nixon says he has no apology for the way he
conducted the war in Southeast Asia, regret
ting only that he didn't step up the military
drive earlier to bring the North Vietnamese to
the bargaining table.
In the third segment of Nixon's interviews
with David Frost, to air tonight, a source on the
Frost staff says, the former president credits the
stepped up bombings, the mining of Haiphong
harbor in 1972, and his refusal to bow to
domestic dissent, with finally persuading
Hanoi to come to terms.
The source says Nixon feels that American
involvement in Vietnam was worth the sac
rifices, although it would have been more
popular politically to pull out of the war.
The United States opened a new phase of the
Indochina war on May 9, 1972, mining
Haiphong Harbor and six other North Viet
namese ports and launching an intensified air
offensive against rail and other supply lines in
the north.
If that had been done in 1970, about the time
of the Cambodian invasion, Nixon maintains,
the war might have been ended earlier, the
source said.
The Frost interview covers a wide range ol
topics: the war and protests at home, abuses of
power, the establishment of the "plumbers"
investigative unit in the White House and
compilation of an enemies list by his staff.
Students occupy shooting site
Kent, Ohio — You'd think they'd want to
forget. Instead, they've pitched a tent city to
make sure everyone remembers.
Tentropolis, they call it sometimes. A collec
tion of 70 tents set up on a grassy slope where
National Guardsmen fired on antiwar protes
ters on May 4, 1970.
The 13-second barrage of gunfire cut down
four students, wounded nine others and made
Kent State University (KSU) a name that still
brings back memories of violence.
Now the school wants to build a gymnasium
annex on the site, and about 130 protesters
have been camped there since last Friday and
say they'll remain as long as necessary to stop
construction.
KSU President Glenn Olds said the annex
has been planned since 1965 and the decision
was "irrevocable."
The students hope not.
Olds said yesterday that the protesters will
not be allowed to remain on the slope once
construction begins later this year. He said he
hopes they will leave voluntarily, but "they
will be removed legally and physically if they
do not."
Carter urges gas search
Sacramento — President Jimmy Carter
urged California to go after all the natural gas it
can get, including liquefied natural gas (LNG),
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yesterday.
Brown described his conversation Tuesday
with Carter concerning LNG and other energy
matters and said he will fly to Washington "as
soon as possible" with other California leaders

for more conferences with Carter on LNG.
"We want to make sure before committing
the state to LNG development that we've taken
all other steps to obtain whatever gas supplies
are available, and to protect California con
sumers with respect to the price they will ulti
mately have to pay."
Asked at an informal new conference to de
scribe Carter's attitude toward California plans
to develop an LNG terminal to receive ship
ments of LNG from Alaska and Indonesia,
Brown replied:
"The president's comment was if California
can get itself any gas, it was his firm recom
mendation that they ought to go out and get
it —that the supplies are short, and the state
depends to a great extent on its gas. And our
gas supplies are declining."
Carter hopes for arms reductions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter told
congressional leaders yesterday he still hopes
for "substantial reductions" in U.S. and Rus
sian nuclear arsenals but neither the United
States nor the Soviet Union has changed posi
tion on strategic arms negotiations.
Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders pledged support for the administra
tion's renewed efforts to negotiate arms reduc
tions with the Soviet Union this week in
Geneva.
"There is no new American proposal,"
White House Press Secretary Jody Powell told
reporters after the president met with the law
makers for 90 minutes. "The president remains
hopeful ws can achieve some substantial re
ductions in arms levels.
"We have presented what we believe to be
fair and equitable proposals," Powell said.
"We are willing and eager to...sit down and
talk."
The press secretary said Carter and the con
gressional leaders discussed "possibilities for

progress" in those talks. But he refused to say
what those possibilities are. "I'm not going to
discuss what may or may not be a negotiating
point."
Ginzburg charged in fraud case
San Francisco — California's attorney gen

San Francisco Superior Court charging Ralph

Ginzburg charged in fraud case
San Francisco — California's attorney gen
eral yesterday filed an amended complaint in
San Francisco Superior Court charging Ralph
Ginzburg, publisher of Moneysworth
magazine, with false advertising and failing to

Zambian troops attack resort
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Zambian govern
ment troops fired mortars and machine guns
into the resort town of Victoria Falls yesterday
in a half-hour daylight attack from across the
Zambezi River, military officials said. No dam
age or casualties were reported.
The attack on the town of 3500 persons in
northwest Rhodesia, popular with foreign
tourists, was the first such action since Zam
bian President Kenneth Kaunda declared
Monday that a state of war exists between his
country and white-ruled Rhodesia. The Zam
bezi River and the spectacular Victoria Falls
form the border between the two countries.
Zambia is one of three countries bordering
Rhodesia that grant base areas and military aid
to black nationalists engaged in a 4V2-year
guerrilla war to topple the Salisbury regime.
The other two countries are Mozambique and
Botswana.
The attack coincided with a United Nations
conference in the Mozambique capital of
Maputo that has stressed a violent solution to
the problems of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and
South African-ruled South-West Africa
(Namibia).
Yesterday in Maputo, America's U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young said that Rhodesian
Prime Minister lan Smith hoped to gain West
ern support by luring liberation movements
into bringing Cuba into the conflict. He ac
cused Smith of threatening Zambia and
launching attacks into Botswana.
A military communique in Salisbury de
scribed yesterday's attack as unprovoked and
said Rhodesian troops "have not retaliated."
It said the incoming fire landed in open ter
rain near a police-run Immigration and Cus
toms post overlooking the Zambian border,
closed since 1973.
31 nations ban environmental war
Geneva — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
signed a convention yesterday banning man
made natural disasters in warfare and then
opened three days of talks on nuclear arms and
the Mideast.
The two leaders joined officials from 31
other nations in the council chamber of Gene
va's Palace of Nations for a brief ceremony put
ting an environmental warfare convention into
force and formally beginning ratification pro
cedures toward its becoming international
law.
Massive destruction weapons banned by the
convention include artificial catastrophes
such as tidal waves, hurricanes and ear
thquakes. Such techniques are still on scien
tists' drawing boards.
The two leaders also signed an agreement
renewing a 1972 agreement providing for con
tinued cooperation between Washington and
Moscow in such areas as space meteorology,
environmental studies and the exchange of in
formation on lunar, Mars and Venus explora
tion.
"This is a good treaty," Gromyko said. "It is

connected with the main weapons agreement a
little bit." Hut the Soviet Foreign Minister did
not respond when a reporter asked how long it
would take to reach a new arms limitation ac
cord.
Spying may require warrants
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
proposed legislation yesterday that would re
quire government spies to be equipped with a
court warrant before using wiretaps or bugging
devices to watch agents of foreign powers
operating in the United States.
The president told congressional leaders
that the measure would resolve an inherent
conflict between preservation of human rights
and the need for adequate intelligence for na
tional security.
The legislation, Carter said, has been ap
proved with "almost complete unanimity" by
the executive branch, Congress and the intelli
gence community. But several lawmakers said
they foresee a need for some changes in the bill.
The measure stems from recent disclosures
about widespread spying on Americans at
home and overseas by the CIA, FBI and other
agencies.
Under current law, there are two kinds of
electronic surveillance. One kind requires the
FBI to get approval from a federal judge for taps
and bugs used to gather evidence about domes
tic crimes.
These taps and bugs are used most often in
investigations of organized crime, particularly
gambling. The new proposals do not directly
affect this kind of spying.
The other type of electronic surveillance is
used by the CIA and the National Security
Agency to gather intelligence about foreign
spies. These taps and bugs require the approval
of the attorney general but do not require war
rants from a judge.
Carter's bill would require warrants in these
circumstances.
Generally, the bill requires that the attorney
general obtain a court warrant from one of
seven specially designated district court
judges before approving electronic surveil
lance of suspected foreign agents.
Sudan ousts Soviet military aides
Khartoum, Sudan — Sudan expelled all 90
Soviet military experts in the Sudanese army
yesterday, the Sudanese new agency reported.
It said the experts along with their 57
member families left Khartoum at noon aboard
three Soviet planes.
The expulsion decision was relayed to the
Soviet ambassador to Khartoum a week ago,
the agency added.
An office attached to the Soviet Embassy
which has been operated by the expelled ex
perts was also closed, the agency said.
The experts have been in Sudan since 1970.
Sudan's chief ally, Egypt, expelled 15,000
Soviet military advisers in July 1972.
Nixon: no apologies on Vietnam
Washington — Former President Richard

Nixon says he has no apology for the way he
conducted the war in Southeast Asia, regret
ting only that he didn't step up the military
drive earlier to bring the North Vietnamese to
the bargaining table.
In the third segment of Nixon's interviews
with David Frost, to air tonight, a source on the
Frost staff says, the former president credits the
stepped up bombings, the mining of Haiphong
harbor in 1972, and his refusal to bow to
domestic dissent, with finally persuading
Hanoi to come to terms.
The source says Nixon feels that American
involvement in Vietnam was worth the sac
rifices, although it would have been more
popular politically to pull out of the war.
The United States opened a new phase of the
Indochina war on May 9, 1972, mining
Haiphong Harbor and six other North Viet
namese ports and launching an intensified air
offensive against rail and other supply lines in
the north.
If that had been done in 1970, about the time
of the Cambodian invasion, Nixon maintains,
the war might have been ended earlier, the
source said.
The Frost interview covers a wide range ol
topics: the war and protests at home, abuses of
power, the establishment of the "plumbers"
investigative unit in the White House and
compilation of an enemies list by his staff.
Students occupy shooting site
Kent, Ohio — You'd think they'd want to
forget. Instead, they've pitched a tent city to
make sure everyone remembers.
Tentropolis, they call it sometimes. A collec
tion of 70 tents set up on a grassy slope where
National Guardsmen fired on antiwar protes
ters on May 4, 1970.
The 13-second barrage of gunfire cut down
four students, wounded nine others and made
Kent State University (KSU) a name that still
brings back memories of violence.
Now the school wants to build a gymnasium
annex on the site, and about 130 protesters
have been camped there since last Friday and
say they'll remain as long as necessary to stop
construction.
KSU President Glenn Olds said the annex
has been planned since 1965 and the decision
was "irrevocable."
The students hope not.
Olds said yesterday that the protesters will
not be allowed to remain on the slope once
construction begins later this year. He said he
hopes they will leave voluntarily, but "they
will be removed legally and physically if they
do not."
Carter urges gas search
Sacramento — President Jimmy Carter
urged California to go after all the natural gas it
can get, including liquefied natural gas (LNG),
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yesterday.
Brown described his conversation Tuesday
with Carter concerning LNG and other energy
matters and said he will fly to Washington "as
soon as possible" with other California leaders

for more conferences with Carter on LNG.
"We want to make sure before committing
the state to LNG development that we've taken
all other steps to obtain whatever gas supplies
are available, and to protect California con
sumers with respect to the price they will ulti
mately have to pay."
Asked at an informal new conference to de
scribe Carter's attitude toward California plans
to develop an LNG terminal to receive ship
ments of LNG from Alaska and Indonesia,
Brown replied:
"The president's comment was if California
can get itself any gas, it was his firm recom
mendation that they ought to go out and get
it —that the supplies are short, and the state
depends to a great extent on its gas. And our
gas supplies are declining."
Carter hopes for arms reductions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter told
congressional leaders yesterday he still hopes
for "substantial reductions" in U.S. and Rus
sian nuclear arsenals but neither the United
States nor the Soviet Union has changed posi
tion on strategic arms negotiations.
Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders pledged support for the administra
tion's renewed efforts to negotiate arms reduc
tions with the Soviet Union this week in
Geneva.
"There is no new American proposal,"
White House Press Secretary Jody Powell told
reporters after the president met with the law
makers for 90 minutes. "The president remains
hopeful ws can achieve some substantial re
ductions in arms levels.
"We have presented what we believe to be

Carter hopes for arms reductions
Washington — President Jimmy Carter told
congressional leaders yesterday he still hopes
for "substantial reductions" in U.S. and Rus
sian nuclear arsenals but neither the United
States nor the Soviet Union has changed posi
tion on strategic arms negotiations.
Republican and Democratic congressional
leaders pledged support for the administra
tion's renewed efforts to negotiate arms reduc
tions with the Soviet Union this week in
Geneva.
"There is no new American proposal,"
White House Press Secretary Jody Powell told
reporters after the president met with the law
makers for 90 minutes. "The president remains
hopeful ws can achieve some substantial re
ductions in arms levels.
"We have presented what we believe to be
fair and equitable proposals," Powell said.
"We are willing and eager to...sit down and
talk."
The press secretary said Carter and the con
gressional leaders discussed "possibilities for

progress" in those talks. But he refused to say
what those possibilities are. "I'm not going to
discuss what may or may not be a negotiating
point."
Ginzburg charged in fraud case
San Francisco — California's attorney gen
eral yesterday filed an amended complaint in
San Francisco Superior Court charging Ralph
Ginzburg, publisher of Moneysworth
magazine, with false advertising and failing to
deliver the periodical.
The suit alleges Ginzburg and his New York
corporation, Avant Garde, publisher of the
consumer magazine, defrauded large numbers
of subscribers.

person was dissatisfied.
Among bonus inducements were a Moneys
worth Consumer Encyclopedia, a Moneys
worth Home Medical Advisor and a booklet
entitled Stake Your Claim: How to Work the
Social Security Gold Mine.
The suit alleges that the encyclopedia is a
U.S. Agriculture Department pamphlet pub
lished in 1965 and the medical advisor is an
obsolete 1953 publication.
The attorney general said the social security
benefits are available to only a few individuals.
The suit also clamims many subscribers re
ceived neither their bonuses nor the Moneys
worth magazine and efforts to get refunds were
unsuccessful.

Zambian troops attack resort
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Zambian govern
ment troops fired mortars and machine guns
into the resort town of Victoria Falls yesterday
in a half-hour daylight attack from across the
Zambezi River, military officials said. No dam
age or casualties were reported.
The attack on the town of 3500 persons in
northwest Rhodesia, popular with foreign
tourists, was the first such action since Zam
bian President Kenneth Kaunda declared
Monday that a state of war exists between his
country and white-ruled Rhodesia. The Zam
bezi River and the spectacular Victoria Falls
form the border between the two countries.
Zambia is one of three countries bordering
Rhodesia that grant base areas and military aid
to black nationalists engaged in a 4V2-year
guerrilla war to topple the Salisbury regime.
The other two countries are Mozambique and
Botswana.
The attack coincided with a United Nations
conference in the Mozambique capital of
Maputo that has stressed a violent solution to
the problems of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and
South African-ruled South-West Africa
(Namibia).
Yesterday in Maputo, America's U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young said that Rhodesian
Prime Minister lan Smith hoped to gain West
ern support by luring liberation movements
into bringing Cuba into the conflict. He ac
cused Smith of threatening Zambia and
launching attacks into Botswana.
A military communique in Salisbury de
scribed yesterday's attack as unprovoked and
said Rhodesian troops "have not retaliated."
It said the incoming fire landed in open ter
rain near a police-run Immigration and Cus
toms post overlooking the Zambian border,
closed since 1973.
31 nations ban environmental war
Geneva — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
signed a convention yesterday banning man
made natural disasters in warfare and then
opened three days of talks on nuclear arms and
the Mideast.
The two leaders joined officials from 31
other nations in the council chamber of Gene
va's Palace of Nations for a brief ceremony put
ting an environmental warfare convention into
force and formally beginning ratification pro
cedures toward its becoming international
law.
Massive destruction weapons banned by the
convention include artificial catastrophes
such as tidal waves, hurricanes and ear
thquakes. Such techniques are still on scien
tists' drawing boards.
The two leaders also signed an agreement
renewing a 1972 agreement providing for con
tinued cooperation between Washington and
Moscow in such areas as space meteorology,
environmental studies and the exchange of in
formation on lunar, Mars and Venus explora
tion.
"This is a good treaty," Gromyko said. "It is

connected with the main weapons agreement a
little bit." Hut the Soviet Foreign Minister did
not respond when a reporter asked how long it
would take to reach a new arms limitation ac
cord.
Spying may require warrants
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
proposed legislation yesterday that would re
quire government spies to be equipped with a
court warrant before using wiretaps or bugging
devices to watch agents of foreign powers
operating in the United States.
The president told congressional leaders
that the measure would resolve an inherent
conflict between preservation of human rights
and the need for adequate intelligence for na
tional security.
The legislation, Carter said, has been ap
proved with "almost complete unanimity" by
the executive branch, Congress and the intelli
gence community. But several lawmakers said
they foresee a need for some changes in the bill.
The measure stems from recent disclosures
about widespread spying on Americans at
home and overseas by the CIA, FBI and other
agencies.
Under current law, there are two kinds of
electronic surveillance. One kind requires the
FBI to get approval from a federal judge for taps
and bugs used to gather evidence about domes
tic crimes.
These taps and bugs are used most often in
investigations of organized crime, particularly
gambling. The new proposals do not directly
affect this kind of spying.
The other type of electronic surveillance is
used by the CIA and the National Security
Agency to gather intelligence about foreign
spies. These taps and bugs require the approval
of the attorney general but do not require war
rants from a judge.
Carter's bill would require warrants in these
circumstances.
Generally, the bill requires that the attorney
general obtain a court warrant from one of
seven specially designated district court
judges before approving electronic surveil
lance of suspected foreign agents.
Sudan ousts Soviet military aides
Khartoum, Sudan — Sudan expelled all 90
Soviet military experts in the Sudanese army
yesterday, the Sudanese new agency reported.
It said the experts along with their 57
member families left Khartoum at noon aboard
three Soviet planes.
The expulsion decision was relayed to the
Soviet ambassador to Khartoum a week ago,
the agency added.
An office attached to the Soviet Embassy
which has been operated by the expelled ex
perts was also closed, the agency said.
The experts have been in Sudan since 1970.
Sudan's chief ally, Egypt, expelled 15,000
Soviet military advisers in July 1972.
Nixon: no apologies on Vietnam
Washington — Former President Richard

Nixon says he has no apology for the way he
conducted the war in Southeast Asia, regret
ting only that he didn't step up the military
drive earlier to bring the North Vietnamese to
the bargaining table.
In the third segment of Nixon's interviews
with David Frost, to air tonight, a source on the
Frost staff says, the former president credits the
stepped up bombings, the mining of Haiphong
harbor in 1972, and his refusal to bow to
domestic dissent, with finally persuading
Hanoi to come to terms.
The source says Nixon feels that American
involvement in Vietnam was worth the sac
rifices, although it would have been more
popular politically to pull out of the war.
The United States opened a new phase of the
Indochina war on May 9, 1972, mining
Haiphong Harbor and six other North Viet
namese ports and launching an intensified air
offensive against rail and other supply lines in
the north.
If that had been done in 1970, about the time
of the Cambodian invasion, Nixon maintains,
the war might have been ended earlier, the
source said.
The Frost interview covers a wide range ol
topics: the war and protests at home, abuses of
power, the establishment of the "plumbers"
investigative unit in the White House and
compilation of an enemies list by his staff.
Students occupy shooting site
Kent, Ohio — You'd think they'd want to
forget. Instead, they've pitched a tent city to
make sure everyone remembers.
Tentropolis, they call it sometimes. A collec
tion of 70 tents set up on a grassy slope where
National Guardsmen fired on antiwar protes
ters on May 4, 1970.
The 13-second barrage of gunfire cut down
four students, wounded nine others and made
Kent State University (KSU) a name that still
brings back memories of violence.
Now the school wants to build a gymnasium
annex on the site, and about 130 protesters
have been camped there since last Friday and
say they'll remain as long as necessary to stop
construction.
KSU President Glenn Olds said the annex
has been planned since 1965 and the decision
was "irrevocable."
The students hope not.
Olds said yesterday that the protesters will
not be allowed to remain on the slope once
construction begins later this year. He said he
hopes they will leave voluntarily, but "they
will be removed legally and physically if they
do not."
Carter urges gas search
Sacramento — President Jimmy Carter
urged California to go after all the natural gas it
can get, including liquefied natural gas (LNG),
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yesterday.
Brown described his conversation Tuesday
with Carter concerning LNG and other energy
matters and said he will fly to Washington "as
soon as possible" with other California leaders

for more conferences with Carter on LNG.
"We want to make sure before committing
the state to LNG development that we've taken
all other steps to obtain whatever gas supplies
are available, and to protect California con
sumers with respect to the price they will ulti
mately have to pay."
Asked at an informal new conference to de
scribe Carter's attitude toward California plans
to develop an LNG terminal to receive ship
ments of LNG from Alaska and Indonesia,
Brown replied:
"The president's comment was if California
can get itself any gas, it was his firm recom
mendation that they ought to go out and get
it —that the supplies are short, and the state
depends to a great extent on its gas. And our
gas supplies are declining."
