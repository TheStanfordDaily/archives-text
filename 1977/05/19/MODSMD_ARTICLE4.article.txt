# ERDA to fund solar project

### Chris Wasney 
A solar heating project for the Cent
ral Food Services Building will receive
funding from the federal Energy Re
search and Development Administra
tion (ERDA), according to facilities
engineer Peter Hopf.
ERDA is expected to provide up to
85 per cent of the estimated $66,750
needed to finance the project, one of 11
of its kind in California, said Hopf.
Because solar energy is not yet
economically feasible in private in
dustry, ERDA provides these cost shar
ing plans in an attempt to encourage
further technical research and de
velopment in the solar field.
The new energy system was necessi
tated by leaks in the steam heating sys
tem, and the inefficiency of that sys
tem due to the great distance between
the food service building and the cent
ral steam plant, according to Hopf.
"We lose about 20 per cent of the
heating capacity because the steam has
to travel all the way across campus,"
he said.
Plant Services' original plan to in
stall a gas heater in the building was
scrapped when the University's re
quest for federal funding was ap

proved by ERDA, said Hopf. He said
ERDA publishes proposals to offer cost
sharing for solar development, which
the University monitors. Last
November, a suitable offer appeared,
he said, so the gas heating plan was
postponed and the construction office
made a proposal to ERDA.
The new plan calls for 1000 square
feet of roof-mounted solar heating
panels, along with extensive new pip
ing and a 2000 gallon hot water storage
tank for use at night and during over
cast weather, said Hopf. The system
will provide 80 per cent of the build
ing's needs, he said, with a backup gas
boiler to provide the remainder.
Under the terms of the federal aid
agreement, the University's share of
the costs will pay for the gas boiler
only, said Hopf.

"In effect, we are getting the solar
system for free from the government,"
he added.
Hopf said the major advantages of
the plan are energy conservation, in
creased efficiency and "free heat for 80
per cent of the year." He said the plan
is also a possible prototype of other
solar heating projects around campus.
"Such plans are still in the hoping
stage, and they will depend upon the
success of this project," he said.
Construction will probably not
begin before next spring, he said, be
cause final administrative and con
tractual agreements are still pending.
Hopf said he expects the ERDA to have
final approval in matters of design.
"It's their money, so I guess they
should have their say," he said.

funding from the federal Energy Re
search and Development Administra
tion (ERDA), according to facilities
engineer Peter Hopf.
ERDA is expected to provide up to
85 per cent of the estimated $66,750
needed to finance the project, one of 11
of its kind in California, said Hopf.
Because solar energy is not yet
economically feasible in private in
dustry, ERDA provides these cost shar
ing plans in an attempt to encourage
further technical research and de
velopment in the solar field.
The new energy system was necessi
tated by leaks in the steam heating sys
tem, and the inefficiency of that sys
tem due to the great distance between
the food service building and the cent
ral steam plant, according to Hopf.
"We lose about 20 per cent of the
heating capacity because the steam has
to travel all the way across campus,"
he said.
Plant Services' original plan to in
stall a gas heater in the building was
scrapped when the University's re
quest for federal funding was ap

proved by ERDA, said Hopf. He said
ERDA publishes proposals to offer cost
sharing for solar development, which
the University monitors. Last
November, a suitable offer appeared,
he said, so the gas heating plan was
postponed and the construction office
made a proposal to ERDA.
The new plan calls for 1000 square
feet of roof-mounted solar heating
panels, along with extensive new pip
ing and a 2000 gallon hot water storage
tank for use at night and during over
cast weather, said Hopf. The system
will provide 80 per cent of the build
ing's needs, he said, with a backup gas
boiler to provide the remainder.
Under the terms of the federal aid
agreement, the University's share of
the costs will pay for the gas boiler
only, said Hopf.

"In effect, we are getting the solar
system for free from the government,"
he added.
Hopf said the major advantages of
the plan are energy conservation, in
creased efficiency and "free heat for 80
per cent of the year." He said the plan
is also a possible prototype of other
solar heating projects around campus.
"Such plans are still in the hoping
stage, and they will depend upon the
success of this project," he said.
Construction will probably not
begin before next spring, he said, be
cause final administrative and con
tractual agreements are still pending.
Hopf said he expects the ERDA to have
final approval in matters of design.
"It's their money, so I guess they
should have their say," he said.
