# Energy saved during 'off it' hour
## 
### Will Nixon 
According to preliminary results, there was a 16 per cent
drop in electricity use at the end of "off it" hour yesterday,
Karl Johnson, teacher of the S WOPSI class which sponsored
the hour, said.
"It was really successful," said Johnson. "We were aim
ing for a 10 per cent drop, and 1 thought that was pretty
ambitious. 1 think we pointed out there is an awful lot of
potential for saving."
A Plant Services computer monitors electricity output on
campus. At the end of off it hour, the computer registered
9368 watts ofoutput;a normal readingat thattime wouldbe
11,200 watts.
"We saved over 1800 kilowatts, which is enough to light
over 18,000 100-watt lightbulbs," said Johnson. Noting that
many of the lights turned off were fluorescent and that

fluorescent lights use less energy, Johnson said the number
of fluorescent lights which could have been lit would be
more than double that of the 100-watt bulbs.
"People were pretty aware of off it hour," Johnson said.
During a morning phonathon, he reported, several hundred
calls were made to members of the faculty and staff.
Citing a report by D.D. Goldstein and A.H. Rosenfeld of
Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Johnson said, "If one takes into
account the whole energy balance —supplier plus
consumer—it is al most always cheaper to save a kilowatt of
peak hour energy use (12:30 to 6:30 in the summer) than to
invest $1000 for new capacity."
Therefore, if the University could reduce its peak hour
power use by half the reduction made during off it hour and
maintain this reduction, said Johnson, "it would be cheaper
than the utility companies investing over $900,000 in new
facilities."
