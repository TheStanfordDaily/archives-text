# Senate sends to House Energy Department bill
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Senate
voted yesterday to create a Department
ot Energy, a new Cabinet agency
sought by President Jimmy Carter to
implement the nation's energy
policies.
The legislation now goes to the
House, where a similar bill is awaiting
floor action.
The proposed department, to be
headed by White House energy adviser
James Schlesinger, would have broad
powers over energy pricing and de
velopment.
If enacted, the energy reorganization
would create the first new Cabinet
agency since Congress established the
Department ofTransportation in 1966.
One of the largest
It also would be one of the largest
federal reorganizations ever. The
energy department would start life
with 20,000 employes and a $10.6 bill
ion budget.
Earlier yesterday, a House commit
tee passed its version of the legislation,
clearing the way for floor action in that
chamber.
The House Post Office and Civil Ser
vice Committee approved the legisla
tion 23-0 after amending it to bring
more employes of the proposed de
partment under the same Civil Service

rules that apply to other federal work
ers.
The House version, like the original
administration proposal, would give
all energy pricing powers to the new
energy secretary while the Senate ver
sion would give them to a three
member regulatory board within the
department.
Meanwhile, Carter's proposal for
energy taxes, a part of the president's
proposed new energy policy, was de
scribed as the least painful way to
handle the energy problem by Ralph
Nader's tax group. At the same time,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called
the program a prescription for more
shortages and higher inflation.
Raise taxes
Assuming the worol
and without taking into account Car

ter's proposed tax rebates, the chamber
told the House Ways and Means Com
mittee that Carter's proposals would
raise a typical family's taxes by
$10,000 within the next 10 years.
Robert Brandon, representing
Nader's Citizen's Tax Reform Research
Group, said the general thrust of Car
ter's proposals—conservation and de
velopment of new energy sources —are
welcome. But the program, which
Ways and Means is considering, has
some good points and some bad, Bran
don said.
During the first three days of hear
ings on Carter's energy taxes, Ways
and Means members have roundly
criticized the standby tax increase on
gasoline of as much as 50 cents and the
idea of giving a bonus of up to $4H3 for
purchasers of fuel-efficient cars.
