# New Israeli leader advocates coalition
## 
### 
Tel Aviv (AP) — Menahem Begin,
head of the victorious right-wing
Likud bloc, asked the defeated Labor
party yesterday to join in a coalition
government. He said Israel was ready
for serious negotiations with its Arab
neighbors and "we stand for peace."
There was no immediate word on
whether Labor would accept the offer.
Arab states angrily denounce Begin as
a "terrorist" and said the Likud victory
was a threat to Middle East peace.
Begin, quoting from the U.S. Demo
cratic party platform, called for "face
to-face, direct negotiations" between
Israel and the Arabs. He said he op
posed "externally devised formulas "
apparently referring to indications
Washington might come up with its
own plan.
'Serious negotiations'
"We mean serious negotiations...we
stand for peace," Begin said in an in
terview at his Tel Aviv apartment,
which once served as his guerilla
hideout.
"I believe President (Jimmy) Carter
will keep his commitment," said Be
gin, 63. "Carter said there must be
morality in foreign relations. May Ire

spectfully ask what is more moral than
to keep a commitment?" Begin told
reporters.
Begin said he would not be pinned
down on Likud's pledges never to
withdraw from the West Bank of the
Jordan River. "It is futile," he said. "If
we withdraw from Judea and Samaria
the West Bank our security is de
stroyed and the chance of peace falls to
the ground."
No withdrawal ban
The party platform does not ban
withdrawal. It pledges the West Bank
"will not come under alien rule." In
broadening its appeal for the election,
Likud indicated a readiness to trade
parts of the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights and the Sinai desert.
Begin repeated his intention to issue
a call to leaders of Egypt, Syria and
Jordan to join him at the bargaining
table, either in their respective capitals
or at Geneva.
"If the Geneva conference is con
vened let's say, at the end of this year, I
will go to Geneva," he said.
Begin's victory took U.S. officials by
surprise but a Garter spokesman said
the president wants to meet the new
Israeli premier. "I know he personally
has no concern about the ability of
this government to deal with the freely
chosen government of Israel," he said.
'Notorious terrorist'
State-controlled radios in Arab
lands branded Begin a "notorious ter
rorist" and said the election would
spell disaster for Carter's peace efforts
in the Middle East.
Palestinian guerrillas threatened to
"escalate violence" in the Israeli
occupied Gaza Strip and the West
Bank, over which the Likud wants to
retain Israeli sovereignty.
Sources in Syria said President
Hafez Assad would use the Likud vic
tory to persuade Saudi Arabia to fi
nance additional arms.
Deep divisions
The conservative victory also left
deep political divisions in Israel. Yosef
Sarid, a top Labor official, said he
doubted there could be any coalition
with the Likud.
"Such a wagon would quickly sink
in the mud, with so many people pul
ling at the reins," he said. But other
Laborites, including party chief Shi
mon Peres, were noncommital on Be
gin's invitation, which carried a quote
from Abraham Lincoln about "binding
up the nation's wounds."
Election projections showed the
Likud party with 41 seats in the 120-
seat parliament compared with 33 for
Labor. It was the first defeat for Labor,
which has ruled since Israel became a
nation 29 years ago.
Official results
Official election results, hand
counted and laboriously rechecked,
are not expected for two weeks. But
experts said the projections, based on
results from 1900 of 3879 polling
places, were not expected to vary from
the final totals by more than one seat.
If Labor decides not to join a coali
tion, Likud could join with the Na
tional Religious Party, which was
fourth with 12 seats, and other rightist
and religious splinters to forge a
razor-thin majority.
The key group in the coalition
building process appeared to be Prof.
Yigael Yadin's Democratic Movement
for Change, which won at least 14
seats, an impressive score for a party
founded just six months ago.
Yadin, whose group could provide
badly needed coalition backbone for
Likud, said he would join any party
espousing his faction's principles. But
one of the principles is oppostion to
any move to annex the West Bank.

any move to annex the West Bank.
Tel Aviv (AP) — Menahem Begin,
head of the victorious right-wing
Likud bloc, asked the defeated Labor
party yesterday to join in a coalition
government. He said Israel was ready
for serious negotiations with its Arab
neighbors and "we stand for peace."
There was no immediate word on
whether Labor would accept the offer.
Arab states angrily denounce Begin as
a "terrorist" and said the Likud victory
was a threat to Middle East peace.
Begin, quoting from the U.S. Demo
cratic party platform, called for "face
to-face, direct negotiations" between
Israel and the Arabs. He said he op
posed "externally devised formulas "
apparently referring to indications
Washington might come up with its
own plan.
'Serious negotiations'
"We mean serious negotiations...we
stand for peace," Begin said in an in
terview at his Tel Aviv apartment,
which once served as his guerilla
hideout.
"I believe President (Jimmy) Carter
will keep his commitment," said Be
gin, 63. "Carter said there must be
morality in foreign relations. May Ire

spectfully ask what is more moral than
to keep a commitment?" Begin told
reporters.
Begin said he would not be pinned
down on Likud's pledges never to
withdraw from the West Bank of the
Jordan River. "It is futile," he said. "If
we withdraw from Judea and Samaria
the West Bank our security is de
stroyed and the chance of peace falls to
the ground."
No withdrawal ban
The party platform does not ban
withdrawal. It pledges the West Bank
"will not come under alien rule." In
broadening its appeal for the election,
Likud indicated a readiness to trade
parts of the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights and the Sinai desert.
Begin repeated his intention to issue
a call to leaders of Egypt, Syria and
Jordan to join him at the bargaining
table, either in their respective capitals
or at Geneva.
"If the Geneva conference is con
vened let's say, at the end of this year, I
will go to Geneva," he said.
Begin's victory took U.S. officials by
surprise but a Garter spokesman said
the president wants to meet the new
Israeli premier. "I know he personally
has no concern about the ability of
this government to deal with the freely
chosen government of Israel," he said.
'Notorious terrorist'
State-controlled radios in Arab
lands branded Begin a "notorious ter
rorist" and said the election would
spell disaster for Carter's peace efforts
in the Middle East.
Palestinian guerrillas threatened to
"escalate violence" in the Israeli
occupied Gaza Strip and the West
Bank, over which the Likud wants to
retain Israeli sovereignty.
Sources in Syria said President
Hafez Assad would use the Likud vic
tory to persuade Saudi Arabia to fi
nance additional arms.
Deep divisions
The conservative victory also left
deep political divisions in Israel. Yosef
Sarid, a top Labor official, said he
doubted there could be any coalition
with the Likud.
"Such a wagon would quickly sink
in the mud, with so many people pul
ling at the reins," he said. But other
Laborites, including party chief Shi
mon Peres, were noncommital on Be
gin's invitation, which carried a quote
from Abraham Lincoln about "binding
up the nation's wounds."
Election projections showed the
Likud party with 41 seats in the 120-
seat parliament compared with 33 for
Labor. It was the first defeat for Labor,
which has ruled since Israel became a
nation 29 years ago.
Official results
Official election results, hand
counted and laboriously rechecked,
are not expected for two weeks. But
experts said the projections, based on
results from 1900 of 3879 polling
places, were not expected to vary from
the final totals by more than one seat.
If Labor decides not to join a coali
tion, Likud could join with the Na
tional Religious Party, which was
fourth with 12 seats, and other rightist
and religious splinters to forge a
razor-thin majority.
The key group in the coalition
building process appeared to be Prof.
Yigael Yadin's Democratic Movement
for Change, which won at least 14
seats, an impressive score for a party
founded just six months ago.
Yadin, whose group could provide
badly needed coalition backbone for
Likud, said he would join any party
espousing his faction's principles. But
one of the principles is oppostion to
any move to annex the West Bank.
