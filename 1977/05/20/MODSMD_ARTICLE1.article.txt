## 
### Will Nixon 
Over 1100 persons toured Pacific
Gas & Electric's (PG&E) Energy Con
servation Center—a 40-foot trailer out
side Tresidder Union yesterday, as the
Energy Faire started its four day run
here.
Featuring over 20 different exhibits,
the faire distributes information and
displays ways of saving energy and al
ternate forms of producing energy.
The PG&E trailer displays a solar
heater, different sorts of insulation for
homes and an exhibit on how to save
energy with home appliances.

"People ask why PG&E offers this
display: 'Won't it cut into PG&E's bus
iness?' " said Viona Epperson of
PG&E. "However we have all we can
do to keep up with projected energy
use. Anything we can do to cut back on
use is a help."
Several tables
Inside Tresidder many different
groups have displays. The Energy Re
search and Development Administra
tion has several tables arranged with
pamphlets and reference materials.
A SWOPSI class on energy conser
vation has posted several posters

solar energy and offering some tips on
saving water. The Whole Earth Truck
