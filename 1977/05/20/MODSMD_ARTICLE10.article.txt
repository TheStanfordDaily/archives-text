## DNA still an issue 
### 
A major United States Senate bill calling for federal regulation of
recombinant DNA research is in immediate danger of being sabot
aged by the testimony of a few scientists with vested interest in the
research.
As currently written, 51217, introduced by Senator Kennedy (D-
Mass.), provides for an 11 member National Recombinant DNA
Regulation Commission to investigate the safety questions related to
recombinant DNA research, to establish research regulations, to
recommend legislation and to license all recombinant DNA re
search facilities, both public and private. All commission members
would be appointed by the secretary of HEW (five scientists, six
non-scientists). The bill would provide a uniform, minimal floor for
all recombinant DNA research.
However, scientists interested in continuing recombinant re
search have loudly proclaimed the safety of the research and invoked
the sacrosanctity of science in an effort to weaken the bill.
Under such pressure, two major sets of amendments which
would directly hinder the public's right to protect and govern itself
may well be added next week unless senators such as Cranston,
Javits, Schweiker and Kennedy receive enough letters from con
cerned citizens.
The first proposal is to eliminate the 11 member Commission in
favor of one person — the Secretary of HEW. Such a move would
obviously facilitate low profile, backroom decision making at the
expense of the public's awareness and welfare.
Senator Javits (R-NY) has proposed a second amendment, which
would make 51217 permanently preemptive of all state and local
recombinant DNA regulation, except by special exemption. This
proposal would effectively deny states and communities their right
to determine their own health and safety standards beyond the
minimal federal regulations.
However, the issue is much broader than particular amendments
to a particular bill. The continually accelerating pace of scientific
development and the ever closer link between research and indust
rial application have made scientific research a direct concern of the
public in areas ranging from nuclear power to pollution control to
biological research.
The public has a right not only to protect itself from immediate
danger, but to understand and participate in all scientific develop
ments that affect it.
To assert this right, the public must overcome both the modern
myth of scientific divinity and the firmly entrenched opposition of
the scientific establishment to any scrutiny of its practices.
Recombinant DNA research is the current focal point for this
conflict. The community of Cambridge has taken the responsibility
for determining its own safety in this area, stating: "Knowledge,
whether for its own sake or for its potential benefits to humankind,
cannot serve as a justification for introducing risks to the public
unless an informed citizenry is willing to accept those risks."
Hopefully the public's representatives in Congress will be equally
tenacious and will not back down from asserting the right of the
public to govern itself in the area of scientific research.

As currently written, 51217, introduced by Senator Kennedy (D-
Mass.), provides for an 11 member National Recombinant DNA
Regulation Commission to investigate the safety questions related to
recombinant DNA research, to establish research regulations, to
recommend legislation and to license all recombinant DNA re
search facilities, both public and private. All commission members
would be appointed by the secretary of HEW (five scientists, six
non-scientists). The bill would provide a uniform, minimal floor for
all recombinant DNA research.
However, scientists interested in continuing recombinant re
search have loudly proclaimed the safety of the research and invoked
the sacrosanctity of science in an effort to weaken the bill.
Under such pressure, two major sets of amendments which
would directly hinder the public's right to protect and govern itself
may well be added next week unless senators such as Cranston,
Javits, Schweiker and Kennedy receive enough letters from con
cerned citizens.
The first proposal is to eliminate the 11 member Commission in
favor of one person — the Secretary of HEW. Such a move would
obviously facilitate low profile, backroom decision making at the
expense of the public's awareness and welfare.
Senator Javits (R-NY) has proposed a second amendment, which
would make 51217 permanently preemptive of all state and local
recombinant DNA regulation, except by special exemption. This
proposal would effectively deny states and communities their right
to determine their own health and safety standards beyond the
minimal federal regulations.
However, the issue is much broader than particular amendments
to a particular bill. The continually accelerating pace of scientific
development and the ever closer link between research and indust
rial application have made scientific research a direct concern of the
public in areas ranging from nuclear power to pollution control to
biological research.
The public has a right not only to protect itself from immediate
danger, but to understand and participate in all scientific develop
ments that affect it.
To assert this right, the public must overcome both the modern
myth of scientific divinity and the firmly entrenched opposition of
the scientific establishment to any scrutiny of its practices.
Recombinant DNA research is the current focal point for this
conflict. The community of Cambridge has taken the responsibility
for determining its own safety in this area, stating: "Knowledge,
whether for its own sake or for its potential benefits to humankind,
cannot serve as a justification for introducing risks to the public
unless an informed citizenry is willing to accept those risks."
Hopefully the public's representatives in Congress will be equally
tenacious and will not back down from asserting the right of the
public to govern itself in the area of scientific research.
