This column is in reply to the
outrageous statements made by
Ahmad Abu-El-Haija in a series
of anti-semitic editorials that re
cently appeared in the Daily.
When confronted with words
that are not only distortions but
obviously bear a malicious in
tent, it is difficult to suppress
emotion and respond to them
reasonably and objectively.
I am reminded of the frustra
tion of Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
former ambassador to the United
Nations, when he spoke out
against the U.N. resolution that
equated Zionism with racism.
Moynihan declared, "We
must read Orwell to know the
extraordinary power of the abso
lute inversion of the truth. The
incredible power of that total in
version of reality gives it a claim
to credence by virtue of its unbe
lievability. .
In that spirit, I resolve to stick
to the historical record in com
bating Abu-El-Haija's claims.
Statement
In his column (Daily, May 14),
he makes the following state
ment, "The United Nations Par
tition Plan of November 1947
awarded the 'Jewish State' 56
per cent of the total land area of
Palestine. ... In the ensuing
conflict, Israeli armed forces . . .
occupied about 78 per cent of
Palestine . . . before the entry
into Palestine of a single soldier
from neighboring Arab states."
Abu-El-Haiji assumes that the
European Jews who immigrated
to Palestine from 1904-1948 (the
period of greatest immigration)
displaced the Arab residents and
then presumes that following
the creation of the state of Israel
the Israelis sought to increase
their territory. His version of the
story is simply inaccurate.
The influx of European Jews
that joined the Palestinian
Jewish population that had
never left their homeland did not
confront an Arab government.
Palestine was only a district of
the decadent Ottoman Empire,
Arab rule having ceased in the
year 1072.
Not Arab homeland
Indeed, Palestine was not even
considered to be an Arab home
land. As Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) leader
Ahmed Shukairy admitted in
1956, "It is common knowledge
that Palestine is nothing but
southern Syria." In addition, no
Palestinians were displaced
from their homes.
According to an early pioneer
named Golda Meir, "We dispos
sessed no Arabs. Our toil in the
deserts and marshes of Palestine
created more habitable living
space for both Arab and Jew.
Until 1948, the Arabs of Pales
tine multiplied and flourished as
the direct result of Zionist set
tlement."
As World War I ended, na
tional consciousness was grow
ing in the Middle East both
among the Jews and the Arabs.
But only the Jews took concrete
action to guarantee their sec
urity. In 1917 Great Britain
committed itself to "the estab
lishment in Palestine of a na
tional home for the Jewish
People" in the famous Balfour
Declaration. The League of Na
tions awarded Britain a mandate
to administer Palestine in 1922.
Refusal
As far back as 1923 the Pales
tine Arabs refused a British offer
to establish an Arab Agency
similar to the Jewish Agency. In
May, 1947, Arab spokesmen
formally told the U.N. General
Assembly that "politically the

Arabs of Palestine (were) not in
dependent in the sense of form
ing a separate political entity."
Why didn't the Arabs take ad
vantage of the British offer? The
British Royal Commission of
1936 speculated that "If King
Hussein and Emir Feisal secured
their big Arab state, they would
concede little Palestine to the
Jews."
Only the intransigence of the
Moslem oligarchy of Palestine
and of Haj Amin el Husseini, the
Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, pre
cluded the moderate Arab
movement to establish a state in
the vacuum left by the Turks
after World War I. The fact that
Husseini instigated riots against
Jewish civilians in 1929 and
spent the second world war in
Nazi Germany sheds some light
on his motivations.
Rejection
The 1947 U.N. vote to parti
tion Palestine was rejected out of
hand by Arab spokesmen. On
May 14, 1948, the Jewish State
was proclaimed. Contrary to
what Abu-El-Haija has written, it
was then immediately invaded
by the regular armies of Egypt,
Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Trans-
Jordan.
Abu-El-Haija would also have
us believe that the Israeli inva
sion (sic) led to the "expulsion
and terrorization of nearly
three-quarter million Palesti
nians from their lands and coun
try." Again the facts need to be
set straight.
Sadly, at the outset of the 1948
war, the Arab residents of Pales
tine abandoned their homes on
the promise by their leaders that
they would be able to return after
the massacre of the Jews, whose
property and possessions they
would then inherit. Meanwhile
the Jews continued to conciliate
the Arabs of Palestine, most
poignantly in encouraging the
70,000 Arabs of Haifa to stay in
their homes, despite the orders
of the Grand Mufti.
Unfounded fear
An unfounded Arab fear,
fueled by the divisive intentions
of their manipulative rulers led
to the creation of the Arab re
fugee problem.
Emile Ghoury, Secretary of the
Arab Higher Committee, con
firmed this fact on Sept. 15,1948

stating, "The fact that there are
refugees is the direct consequ
ence of the Arab states opposing
partition and the Jewish State.
The Arab States agreed upon this
policy unanimously and they
must share in the solution to the
problem."
Contrary to the Arab leaders I
have quoted, Abu-El-Haija still
maintains that "since 1948, the
right of return for the displaced
Palestinians has been de
nied. . Israel has always wel
comed back the Arabs who fled
their homes in 1948. Israel bars
no one from becoming a citizen.
The 140,000 Arabs who chose to
stay in Israel today enjoy more
political freedom, more educa
tional opportunity and a higher
standard of living than any
Arabs in the Arab world.
Constructive
In place of his inflammatory
rhetoric — "the rights of the
Palestinians in the occupied ter
ritories have been violated" —
Abu-El-Haija would be more
constructive to ask why the
Arabs of Palestine living in Jor
dan, Egypt and Lebanon have
failed to extend aid to the re
fugees, leaving them destitute,
over the last 29 years.
Tragically, the refugees were
intentionally not assimilated by
the neighboring Arab states in
order to keep hatred of the Jews
at a high pitch. They are unfor
tunate political pawns, more so
because they have been vic
timized by their own brothers. A
generation of misguided and
fanatic Arabs has been raised to
recapture a state that they never
had.
But the chronology I have just
outlined does not end discus
sion of the refugee problem. For
even though their historical
claims are false, the refugees do
believe in their hearts that they
have legitimate claims.
Although opinions vary
greatly in Israel, I think it's safe
to say that the Israeli govern
ment is willing to negotiate to
help these poor people.
Israel has stated time and
again that it will discuss the es
tablishment of a Palestinian state
with anyone who does not deny
their right to exist. This is not too
much to ask.
