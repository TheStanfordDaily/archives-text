# In defense of expensive French restaurants
## 
### 
Fr?nch restaurants are a dime a dozen in the Bay
Area — but be prepared to spend a lot more than that
if you go to a good one.
It is difficult to justify the outlay of large sums of
cash for a meal; student budgets do not always allow
for such extravagances. But at an expensive restaur
ant you are paying for the total experience.
Like concerts or films, dining out can be a sensory
entertainment. It should go without saying that the
freshest ingredients and finest cuts of meat are used.
But if the chef, maitre d'hotel and the waiters do not
"perform" as well as you expect, then the enjoyment
of the spectacle diminishes.
The chef is experienced and should have expert
judgment in his art. Acknowledged wine ste
wards, cheeses at room temperature, a butter knife,
freshly cracked pepper and fresh flowers are extras
which divide the great from the merely mundane.
If the service should be poor, do not feel obligated
to tip the standard 15 per cent. But if the service is
faultless, show your appreciation to those who
brought off your evening.
The final word. French restaurants on the penin
sula may lack the exotic appeal of the City's prestige

restaurants. Much of their reputation comes, not
from their foods, but the service. By and large, the
best local French restaurants can compete with their
counterparts in the City.

La Terrasse is Leon Sidel
la's third French restaurant in
the Bay Area and it continues
his policy of good food at
reasonable prices.
Le Diner includes soupe du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy
vinaigrette dressing. Al
though strong on French
wines, the wine list underre
presents the vineyards of
California.
Hors d'oeuvres include
piping hot escargot de Bour
gogne ($2.95) that were
plump and not overwhelmed
by garlic. Better still is the
crepe de fruits de mer ($2.75),
creamed scallops, crab and
shrimp encased in a thin

crepe. Soupe a l'oignon
($1.75) had a fine broth but it
was too cheesy.
Salmon Joinville ($7.75) al
though poached to perfec
tion, was suffocated by tough
shrimp and a rich brandy
cream and paprika sauce.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream —
$7.50) were inconsistent.
Some were marvelous, but
others, not satisfactorily de
membraned, were chewy and
rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Inside, la Terrasse is cheery
and homey, with a young,
lively clientele. Except tor a

few disappointments in the
food, it is a restaurant you
can't help liking.
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots and oys
ters. Fate Maison ($2.50) is of
the pureed liver variety, but
was too dry. Coquilles St. Jac
ques ($2.95) was nothing but
overcooked scallops in a
tangy white wine sauce.
Entrees came with soup de
jour and salad. A la carte
soupe a l'Oignon Gratinee
($1) was extremely salty and
undistinguished. Rather, try
Vichyssoise, Justine's fine
version of cold potato and
leek soup. The house salads
were tired and drenched by a
salty house dressing.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak
with green peppercorns
($9.50) among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in
Cream Sauce ($8.25) were ex

tremely tender, but the veal
was too thick for classic es
calopes. Rather, they resem
bled veal medallions. Truite
Piemontaise (fresh trout with
white wine sauce—s7.so) is
outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with ice
cream, nuts and Crand Mar
nier is a visual as well as taste
treat.
The chef here has a heavy
hand with salt (as
exemplified by the Coquilles,
onion soup and salad dres
sing) and sauces—there's too
much of both.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez Justine
exist on the peninsula, don't
miss Sunday Champagne
Brunch. The incredible buffet
is already a legend in the Bay
Area. Many students here fast
for two days before parting
with their $6.
The waiters dash about Les
Provinces' spacious blue din

ing room of muted elegance.
Flambes and other tab
leside preparations form part
of the spectacle. The experi
enced and knowledgeable
staff freely make recommen
dations from the well-chosen
menu. Dinners are $2 extra
when served with soup, salad
and dessert.
Everything is a specialty of
the provinces of France: Jam
bon Fume d'Alsace ($2.50),
Canard Norinande for two
($17), Carre d'Agneau Dijon
naise for two ($18). The im
agination of Chef Jean-Pierre
Doigneau shows in his sterl
ing sauces and in his season
ings.
Sorrel delicately accents
the fresh salmon ($6.75),
poached in white wine. The
admirable home-made pate
($2.25) is flavored with ar
magnac. Two first-rate ap
petizers are the savoury es
cargots ($3.25), pungent with
garlic and the meaty ham cre
pes ($2.50) ina superior sauce
mornay. Two interesting
soups are the Sherried Con
somme (warm or cold —
$1.50), and when available,
cream of fresh crayfish or
Maine lobster ($2.75).
All the salads are tossed at
your table with flair. Green
salad with roquefort ($1.75) is
good. But the mushroom
salad ($2.75) is superb. To
tally unblemished white
mushrooms with herbs on a
bed of butter lettuce, it is vis
ually appealing as well.
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
paupiette of duck (stuffed
duck) in particular is out
standing.
Avoid the chocolate
mousse ($1.75) for dessert.
Rather, try the frozen straw
berry mousse ($1.75) or the
dramatic Grand Marnier souf
fle ($3). Don't pass up another

house specialty—the apple
tart ($1.75). Classically exe
cuted with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
Les Provinces is a luxury
restaurant. Only nine months
old, it shows consistency in
all areas of its menu. I'll be
back.
The cuisines of France
and Italy harmonize
well at Liason. The French
country inn atmosphere mis
ses just a little, but the lively
clientele compensates. The
service may lack the "slick
ness" of Les Provinces, but
the waiters are more persona
ble. Furthermore, Liaison
serves the best Italian food in
the area.
One of Liaison's pastas
split two or even three ways,
make an ideal starter. I re
commend Linguine con Von
gole ($5) or the Tortellini
"Liaison," in a tomato-cream
sauce with onions. Not over
cooked, the pastas resisted
just enough to the bite.

Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold
watercress ($1.50) is gener
ous in portion but too heavy
on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice
of soup or salad (the house oil
and vinegar dressing is a little
glutinous). Veal dishes here
are exemplary. Veal Piccata
with capers ($8.50) and
Scaloppini of Veal with fresh
mushrooms ($8) are fork
tender. The veal is white and
milk fed—you won't find bet
ter anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and
Roast Saddle of Lamb Floren
tine for two ($2l) are also
good bets.
Desserts include Zabaione
for two ($4), and two superior
treatments of old favorites:
Chocolate Mousse ($1.50)
and a silky caramel custard
($.25). Liaison's portions are
larger than the other restaur
ants, but you don't have to
struggle for dessert.
Fr?nch restaurants are a dime a dozen in the Bay
Area — but be prepared to spend a lot more than that
if you go to a good one.
It is difficult to justify the outlay of large sums of
cash for a meal; student budgets do not always allow

La Terrasse is Leon Sidel
la's third French restaurant in
the Bay Area and it continues
his policy of good food at
reasonable prices.
Le Diner includes soupe du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy
vinaigrette dressing. Al
though strong on French
wines, the wine list underre
presents the vineyards of
California.
Hors d'oeuvres include
piping hot escargot de Bour
gogne ($2.95) that were
plump and not overwhelmed
by garlic. Better still is the
crepe de fruits de mer ($2.75),
creamed scallops, crab and
shrimp encased in a thin

crepe. Soupe a l'oignon
($1.75) had a fine broth but it
was too cheesy.
Salmon Joinville ($7.75) al
though poached to perfec
tion, was suffocated by tough
shrimp and a rich brandy
cream and paprika sauce.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream —
$7.50) were inconsistent.
Some were marvelous, but
others, not satisfactorily de
membraned, were chewy and
rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Inside, la Terrasse is cheery
and homey, with a young,
lively clientele. Except tor a

few disappointments in the
food, it is a restaurant you
can't help liking.
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots and oys
ters. Fate Maison ($2.50) is of
the pureed liver variety, but
was too dry. Coquilles St. Jac
ques ($2.95) was nothing but
overcooked scallops in a
tangy white wine sauce.
Entrees came with soup de
jour and salad. A la carte
soupe a l'Oignon Gratinee
($1) was extremely salty and
undistinguished. Rather, try
Vichyssoise, Justine's fine
version of cold potato and
leek soup. The house salads
were tired and drenched by a
salty house dressing.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak
with green peppercorns
($9.50) among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in
Cream Sauce ($8.25) were ex

tremely tender, but the veal
was too thick for classic es
calopes. Rather, they resem
bled veal medallions. Truite
Piemontaise (fresh trout with
white wine sauce—s7.so) is
outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with ice
cream, nuts and Crand Mar
nier is a visual as well as taste
treat.
The chef here has a heavy
hand with salt (as
exemplified by the Coquilles,
onion soup and salad dres
sing) and sauces—there's too
much of both.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez Justine
exist on the peninsula, don't
miss Sunday Champagne
Brunch. The incredible buffet
is already a legend in the Bay
Area. Many students here fast
for two days before parting

The waiters dash about Les

Flambes and other tab

staff freely make recommen

and dessert.
Everything is a specialty of
the provinces of France: Jam
bon Fume d'Alsace ($2.50),
Canard Norinande for two
($17), Carre d'Agneau Dijon
naise for two ($18). The im
agination of Chef Jean-Pierre
Doigneau shows in his sterl
ing sauces and in his season

Sorrel delicately accents
the fresh salmon ($6.75),
poached in white wine. The
admirable home-made pate
($2.25) is flavored with ar
magnac. Two first-rate ap
petizers are the savoury es
cargots ($3.25), pungent with
garlic and the meaty ham cre

mornay. Two interesting
soups are the Sherried Con

Sorrel delicately accents
the fresh salmon ($6.75),
poached in white wine. The
admirable home-made pate
($2.25) is flavored with ar

cargots ($3.25), pungent with
garlic and the meaty ham cre

soups are the Sherried Con

$1.50), and when available,
cream of fresh crayfish or
Maine lobster ($2.75).
All the salads are tossed at

salad ($2.75) is superb. To

Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a

paupiette of duck (stuffed

Avoid the chocolate

Rather, try the frozen straw
berry mousse ($1.75) or the

The chef is experienced and should have expert

freshly cracked pepper and fresh flowers are extras
which divide the great from the merely mundane.
If the service should be poor, do not feel obligated

The final word. French restaurants on the penin

La Terrasse is Leon Sidel

his policy of good food at
reasonable prices.
Le Diner includes soupe du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy
vinaigrette dressing. Al
though strong on French
wines, the wine list underre
presents the vineyards of
California.
Hors d'oeuvres include
piping hot escargot de Bour
gogne ($2.95) that were
plump and not overwhelmed
by garlic. Better still is the
crepe de fruits de mer ($2.75),
creamed scallops, crab and

crepe. Soupe a l'oignon
($1.75) had a fine broth but it

freshly cracked pepper and fresh flowers are extras
which divide the great from the merely mundane.
If the service should be poor, do not feel obligated
to tip the standard 15 per cent. But if the service is
faultless, show your appreciation to those who
brought off your evening.
The final word. French restaurants on the penin
sula may lack the exotic appeal of the City's prestige

restaurants. Much of their reputation comes, not
from their foods, but the service. By and large, the
best local French restaurants can compete with their
counterparts in the City.

★★★ ★ *

La Terrasse is Leon Sidel
la's third French restaurant in
the Bay Area and it continues
his policy of good food at
reasonable prices.
Le Diner includes soupe du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy
vinaigrette dressing. Al
though strong on French
wines, the wine list underre
presents the vineyards of
California.
Hors d'oeuvres include
piping hot escargot de Bour
gogne ($2.95) that were
plump and not overwhelmed
by garlic. Better still is the
crepe de fruits de mer ($2.75),
creamed scallops, crab and
shrimp encased in a thin

crepe. Soupe a l'oignon
($1.75) had a fine broth but it
was too cheesy.
Salmon Joinville ($7.75) al
though poached to perfec
tion, was suffocated by tough
shrimp and a rich brandy
cream and paprika sauce.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream —
$7.50) were inconsistent.
Some were marvelous, but
others, not satisfactorily de
membraned, were chewy and
rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Inside, la Terrasse is cheery
and homey, with a young,
lively clientele. Except tor a

few disappointments in the
food, it is a restaurant you
can't help liking.
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots and oys
ters. Fate Maison ($2.50) is of
the pureed liver variety, but
was too dry. Coquilles St. Jac
ques ($2.95) was nothing but
overcooked scallops in a
tangy white wine sauce.
Entrees came with soup de
jour and salad. A la carte
soupe a l'Oignon Gratinee
($1) was extremely salty and
undistinguished. Rather, try
Vichyssoise, Justine's fine
version of cold potato and
leek soup. The house salads
were tired and drenched by a
salty house dressing.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak
with green peppercorns
($9.50) among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in
Cream Sauce ($8.25) were ex

tremely tender, but the veal
was too thick for classic es
calopes. Rather, they resem
bled veal medallions. Truite
Piemontaise (fresh trout with
white wine sauce—s7.so) is
outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with ice
cream, nuts and Crand Mar
nier is a visual as well as taste
treat.
The chef here has a heavy
hand with salt (as
exemplified by the Coquilles,
onion soup and salad dres
sing) and sauces—there's too
much of both.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez Justine
exist on the peninsula, don't
miss Sunday Champagne
Brunch. The incredible buffet
is already a legend in the Bay
Area. Many students here fast
for two days before parting
with their $6.
The waiters dash about Les
Provinces' spacious blue din

ing room of muted elegance.
Flambes and other tab
leside preparations form part
of the spectacle. The experi
enced and knowledgeable
staff freely make recommen
dations from the well-chosen
menu. Dinners are $2 extra
when served with soup, salad
and dessert.
Everything is a specialty of
the provinces of France: Jam
bon Fume d'Alsace ($2.50),
Canard Norinande for two
($17), Carre d'Agneau Dijon
naise for two ($18). The im
agination of Chef Jean-Pierre
Doigneau shows in his sterl
ing sauces and in his season
ings.
Sorrel delicately accents
the fresh salmon ($6.75),
poached in white wine. The
admirable home-made pate
($2.25) is flavored with ar
magnac. Two first-rate ap
petizers are the savoury es
cargots ($3.25), pungent with
garlic and the meaty ham cre
pes ($2.50) ina superior sauce
mornay. Two interesting
soups are the Sherried Con
somme (warm or cold —
$1.50), and when available,
cream of fresh crayfish or
Maine lobster ($2.75).
All the salads are tossed at
your table with flair. Green
salad with roquefort ($1.75) is
good. But the mushroom
salad ($2.75) is superb. To
tally unblemished white
mushrooms with herbs on a
bed of butter lettuce, it is vis
ually appealing as well.
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
paupiette of duck (stuffed
duck) in particular is out
standing.
Avoid the chocolate
mousse ($1.75) for dessert.
Rather, try the frozen straw
berry mousse ($1.75) or the
dramatic Grand Marnier souf
fle ($3). Don't pass up another

house specialty—the apple
tart ($1.75). Classically exe
cuted with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
Les Provinces is a luxury
restaurant. Only nine months
old, it shows consistency in
all areas of its menu. I'll be
back.
The cuisines of France
and Italy harmonize
well at Liason. The French
country inn atmosphere mis
ses just a little, but the lively
clientele compensates. The
service may lack the "slick
ness" of Les Provinces, but
the waiters are more persona
ble. Furthermore, Liaison
serves the best Italian food in
the area.
One of Liaison's pastas
split two or even three ways,
make an ideal starter. I re
commend Linguine con Von
gole ($5) or the Tortellini
"Liaison," in a tomato-cream
sauce with onions. Not over
cooked, the pastas resisted
just enough to the bite.

Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold
watercress ($1.50) is gener
ous in portion but too heavy
on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice
of soup or salad (the house oil
and vinegar dressing is a little
glutinous). Veal dishes here
are exemplary. Veal Piccata
with capers ($8.50) and
Scaloppini of Veal with fresh
mushrooms ($8) are fork
tender. The veal is white and
milk fed—you won't find bet
ter anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and
Roast Saddle of Lamb Floren
tine for two ($2l) are also
good bets.
Desserts include Zabaione
for two ($4), and two superior
treatments of old favorites:
Chocolate Mousse ($1.50)
and a silky caramel custard
($.25). Liaison's portions are
larger than the other restaur
ants, but you don't have to
struggle for dessert.
Fr?nch restaurants are a dime a dozen in the Bay
Area — but be prepared to spend a lot more than that
if you go to a good one.
It is difficult to justify the outlay of large sums of
cash for a meal; student budgets do not always allow
for such extravagances. But at an expensive restaur
ant you are paying for the total experience.
Like concerts or films, dining out can be a sensory
entertainment. It should go without saying that the
freshest ingredients and finest cuts of meat are used.
But if the chef, maitre d'hotel and the waiters do not
"perform" as well as you expect, then the enjoyment
of the spectacle diminishes.
The chef is experienced and should have expert
judgment in his art. Acknowledged wine ste
wards, cheeses at room temperature, a butter knife,
freshly cracked pepper and fresh flowers are extras
which divide the great from the merely mundane.
If the service should be poor, do not feel obligated
to tip the standard 15 per cent. But if the service is
faultless, show your appreciation to those who
brought off your evening.
The final word. French restaurants on the penin
sula may lack the exotic appeal of the City's prestige

restaurants. Much of their reputation comes, not
from their foods, but the service. By and large, the
best local French restaurants can compete with their
