What do you think they are?
I'ad foods? New student organi
zations? The middle names of
distinguished faculty? All
wrong.
Try these: New Frisbee, Ear
thball, People Pass and Siamese
Soccer. Right. They're games,
special games â€” "New Games,"
designed for sheer fun and
creativity, for one or a hundred.
And, if you don't like the rules or
how the games progress, then
change the rules. Or change
sides. Or players. Its all fair as
long as no one gets hurt and
everyone can play. Players are
partners in New Games, not op
ponents; everyone wins.
Festival today
And now, New Games have
come to Stanford. A New Games
Festival will be held today from
noon until 3 p.m. in White Plaza.
It will include many games:
Slaughter, Earthball, New Fris
bee, parachute games and bof
fers, foam swords for dueling.
There will also be acoustic
music by Herb Moore and
Friends and free juggling les

sons.
The festival has been or
ganized by SCIRE and the Tre
sidder Program Board as a pilot
project in anticipation of a
large-scale, full day tournament
scheduled for next fall quarter.
They hope to encourage student
organizations in planning the
fall event and to set up informa
tion booths on the playing site to
inform the Stanford community
and general public of the various
student activities and concerns.
SCIRE is also interested in help
ing students and organizations
establish accredited internship
experiences with community
organizations and businesses.
The Stanford Energy Faire
will also be held today (going
through Sunday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m.),
upstairs in Tresidder Union. The
faire will include displays and
demonstrations of energy and
water conservation systems and
devices. Sponsors range from
the California State Department
of Water Resources to the Whole
Earth Truck Store. Dislays in
clude wood burning stoves,
windmills and a 40 ft. PG&E
traveling exhibit.

New Games has an interesting
history. First established by
Stewart Brand, founder of the
Whole Earth Catalog, the motto
of the games is "Play Hard, Play
Fair, Nobody Hurt," encourag
ing games which are neither
competitive nor exclusive.
Brand invented the games at a
1967 anti-war demonstration.
He devised the game Slaughter,
setting out a large wrestling mat
and dividing a group of 40 into
two teams. The rules held that
anyone would be "killed" if tos
sed off the mat. But, Brand
wanted a game that was as soft
and peaceful as it was exciting
and strenuous, so he added a
catch: all players must move on
their knees.
Forty demonstrators got on the
mat, wrestled and grabbed,
knocked and pushed. A few en
terprised and grabbed the legs of
spectators, drawing them in. The
field boundaries spread and
soon hundreds were involved,
their aggression fading into
laughter, their anger into sur
prise.
Brand had brought a six foot
canvas ball painted as a giant
globe. He threw it into the crowd

and ruled that teams must try to
push the ball over their oppo
nents' end-zone.
Earthball
people surged for the ball,
moving it slowly back and forth
between goals, hoping to win.
An interesting thing happened;
as one team neared the others'
end-zone, their opponents
would detect and lend a hand to
the losers. People were so en
thralled with the game that it
lasted for an hour without a
score. Earthball had been in
vented.
Soon, the New Games Founda
tion was founded, inventing
many more gaines and establish
ing tournaments for community
action groups and park recrea
tion services. The foundation is a
Bay Area phenomena; a recent
event, a full-day tournament
held in Golden Gate Park, at
tracted over 20,000 people and
resulted in the declaration of
New Games Day by San Francis
co's mayor.
So bring a frisbee and a brew,
some new game ideas, or just
yourself and a friend. And re
member, don't just stand and
watch. That's old games.
