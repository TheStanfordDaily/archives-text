the sound "creates a very intense experience for the singers
and also for the listeners. It's a sound that can fill very, very
large spaces." Their material is authentic, and even includes
some "really funky village stuff," said Dubinskas, including
"a shouting match between groups of 'boys and girls,'" who
hurtle insults at each other in Romanian. Tickets are $2 for
