### Chris Wasney 
"Indian Awareness" will be the
theme of the Stanford American In
dian Organization's (SAIO) sixth an
nual powwow, which runs today
through Sunday.
The powwow is being sponsored
jointly by the SAIO and UC-Berkeley's
Native American Student Organiza
tion, and will be held on the in
tramural fields northeast of Stanford
Stadium. It will feature native Ameri
can dancing, food, and arts and crafts,
according to Dave Isenberg, coor
dinator of the powwow and SAIO vice
president.
"The powwow is intended to give
people an opportunity to meet other
Indian people, as sort of a cultural ex
change," said Isenberg.
Tribes from as far away as South
Dakota will participate in dances and
sponsor booths. Local groups such as
the San Mateo and San Jose Indian As
sociations will also participate, ac
cording to Larry Goroppe, assistant
dean of students affairs for native
American affairs.
Stu Tonamah, head of the National

Advisory Council on Indian Education
will also attend, and will speak briefly
in White Plaza today at 12:45 p.m. to
publicize the event.
The powwow is nonprofit. Produc
tion costs total approximately $4000.
"The University gives us very little
money, so we rely upon the local In
dian groups to finance a large part of
the powwow. These groups have also
helped out by doing the many little
things that need to be done," said
Isenberg.
"We hope to establish the powwow
as an annual tradition, so we can get
regular funding from the University to
avoid the hassles of fundraising every
year," he added.
Approximately 25 booths will be set
up at the powwow, with wares ranging
from native American weaving to tur
quoise jewelry. Foods such as fry
bread, Navaho tacos and native
American stew will be sold.
The powwow begins at 8:30 p.m. to
