What shaJJ be the fate of the lush vegetation of
this Garden of Eden (The Farm), as a result of the
insufferable drought?
-KM.
Herb Fong, grounds supervisor, said Plant Ser
vices' policy is "not to let anything die if they can
help it." Palm trees will make it on their own, but
new trees "will need hand-watering."
Since it isn't feasible to water the very large
trees, they, along with sick or weak trees, may be
the first to go. Especially the large trees by Gover
nor's Lane since they "don't have real deep tap
roots."
Plant Services has already taken down "poten
tial hazard" trees around campus, and grass is
being replaced in certain areas with more drought
resistant plants, e.g. junipers and mirror shrubs.
Fong said this is because grass takes the most water
of any ornamental plant.

So there may be less grass, but the Farm will try
to stay as green as possible.

What is the penalty for ridinga bicycled runkon
campus?
-R.T.W.
Laverne Hart of the Stanford Police called the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department for me
and found some answers.
Apparently, the same rules apply on the road no
matter what type of vehicle one is operating. So
you could be arrested for riding your bibycle
drunk, and the penalty would be determined by
the court.
Although the chances that you would be ar
rested for drunk bicycle riding are slim, Hart said
that it would also be possible for you to be arrested
for intoxication in public or intoxication on a pub
lic road.
