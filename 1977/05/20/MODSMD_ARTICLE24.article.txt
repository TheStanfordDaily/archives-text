## James Lofton: staying on top of things 
### 
James Lofton is on top of things. This
season, the junior from Los Angeles, has
the world's best mark in the long jump—
26-9. The jump, which came last March in
Mexico City, put Lofton into third place
as the best jump recorded by a Pac-8 per
former.
Last Friday, Lofton captured the Pac-8
long jump crown with a jump of 26-4 3 / 4 .
The week prior to the Pac-Bs, he injured
his hamstring and there was some doubt
among track fans about whether he would
be able to unload against his two biggest
rivals—USC's Larry Doubley and UCLA's
Willie Banks.
Lofton said for any athlete to be suc
cessful, it takes "the fourTs—technique,
training, timing and talent." But Lofton
has a secret weapon of which none of the
other world-class jumpers can boast—his
father, who himself was a successful col
legiate long jumper and quarter miler.
"At the Stanford relays, he sat up in the
stands just screaming at the top of his
lungs, 'Get up, James! Jump! Jump boy!"'
said Lofton of his father. "I was running
down the runway and I could hear him
yelling. When Willie Banks (owner of the
best triple jump mark in the world this
season) beat me down at UCLA, I had just
finished jumping my last jump. Banks
had one more jump. Then 1 hear this voice
in the stands yelling. 'Save yourself, Wil
lie. Don't jump anymore. Save yourself
for the triple jump.'
"When Gerald Hardeman of USC beat
m£ my freshman year, he was running
down the runway and my father was
screaming, 'Fall down, Gerald.'
Doesn't a screaming madman like that
make Lofton nervous?
Nerves of steel
"You may find this hard to believe,"
Lofton began, "but 1 don't get nervous.
The first time ever was last weekend at the
Pac-8 meet and I think it was because I
was semi-hurt.
"1 jumped 24 feet on the first jump and I
said, 'Man, what's wrong? Shit, I'm nerv
ous.' On the second jump I just ran
through the pit, my step was so off. And I
said, 'Shit. 1 can see it in the papers: "Lof
ton bombs out.'" People would ask me
what happened in the Pac-8s and I'd have
to say, 'Well, uh, 1 was hurt."'
Lofton likes to be No. I—the man to

beat —but he's getting antsy for interna
tional competition. He has never been a
member of an AAU team that has taken an
international trip, and last summer he
missed out on international competition
when he placed fifth at the Olympic trials,
not making the '76 Olympic team.
"By no means is the NCAA the biggest
meet in track," he said. "The NCAA is the
kids' meet, the men run AAU. The Pac-8
win wasn't that big a deal to me. None of
these meets seem that important any
more.
"It's like trick or treating. You've been
around your block once and it's no fun the
second time.
"I want to win at the National AAU
meet in June so I can make the U.S. team
and go to Europe because I want to win
over there."
Lofton said there is a psych out tactic in
the long jump.
Thinking about it
"In the long jump you're competing
against yourself," he said. "If you're
doing that when the competition is tough,
you'll do well. If somebody jumps far and
you worry too much, it'll just destroy you.
"Like me and Willie Banks were talking
at the Pac-Bs. He jumps real good. He's a
good technician. He said, 'Man, how do
you guys do it? How do you just unload
when you have to?' And I said, 'Willie,
don't worry about it. You're doing good.'
The next day he goes out and jumps 55-3
y 4 —the best jump in the world and the
stadium record for the fourth time.
"Doubley takes the whole thing too
seriously. When I moved ahead of him at
the Pac-8s he sat on the ground praying.
I've seen a lot of people disappointed.
There's just no reason —you do the best
you can and after that what else is there?"
Lofton is loose and relaxed on the track.
"For me the highest point in sports isn't
winning," he said. "It's having fun. Say if
somebody wins every meet and they're
not satisfied, well, that's not your whole
life. It's a big part, but you have to live
after the meet is over."
Lofton has watched films of his jumps
as well as his 400 meter races and been a
little disappointed.
"I've got a mental image of myself," he
said. "But there is no difference in the
way I look when I jump 25-8 or 26-9. The
same in the 400. I thought some of my

fastest runs would look really fluid. But
they don't.
"When I'm running I can feel my
technique—like my knees coming up and
my stride extended. 1 feel fluid. To run
perfect it would be like running water —it
just goes. When you compete, it would be
really good if you could compete at your
highest level and isolate your com
petitors. It would be good if you could run
alone in the dark and actually feel your
self run. You wouldn't be able to look
around. You'd have to sense the other
guys more with your body. You'd be more
aware of what your own body was doing."
One of the top two-sport stars in the
nation, Lofton is being scouted heavily by
pro football teams as a wide receiver. Last
season he caught 12 passes—four of
which were touchdowns. His speed and
quick moves have prompted football
coach Bill Walsh to liken him to Isaac
Curtis of the Cincinnati Bengals.
"Which would I choose, green bucks or
an Olympic gold medal?" Lofton asked.
"I know the people who have won four
out of the last five gold medals and every
one of them told me to play pro football. I
guess it's a choice they never had—
something they couldn't do.
Conditioning in football?
"In football I don't train anywhere near
the way 1 do in track. Bring them (football
players) all out to the track. Track will
kick you in the tail.
"Just now I'm realizing how violent
football really is. I've escaped being hit
really hard. To tell you the truth, I'm tired
after I run two plays. All that hitting and
rolling off the ground. After about five
plays I look over to the sideline and think,
'Substition?'"
Has Lofton ever sat back and marveled
at his athletic success?
"Almost," he admitted. "But I want to
get better. When you finally sit back it
seems like the end of it. It's like painting a
picture. You wouldn't stop in the middle
and say, 'Wow, this is going to be a really
great piece of art.' You have to keep work
ing.
"I figure as long as every year I come
out and can say that I feel a little bit faster
and a little bit stronger, then I'll stick at it.
But the year I come out and say, 'Wow, I
felt better last year,' that's the year I re
tire."

said Lofton of his father. "I was running
down the runway and I could hear him
yelling. When Willie Banks (owner of the
best triple jump mark in the world this
season) beat me down at UCLA, I had just
finished jumping my last jump. Banks
had one more jump. Then 1 hear this voice
in the stands yelling. 'Save yourself, Wil
lie. Don't jump anymore. Save yourself
for the triple jump.'
"When Gerald Hardeman of USC beat
m£ my freshman year, he was running
down the runway and my father was
screaming, 'Fall down, Gerald.'
Doesn't a screaming madman like that
make Lofton nervous?
Nerves of steel
"You may find this hard to believe,"
Lofton began, "but 1 don't get nervous.
The first time ever was last weekend at the
Pac-8 meet and I think it was because I
was semi-hurt.
"1 jumped 24 feet on the first jump and I
said, 'Man, what's wrong? Shit, I'm nerv
ous.' On the second jump I just ran
through the pit, my step was so off. And I
said, 'Shit. 1 can see it in the papers: "Lof
ton bombs out.'" People would ask me
what happened in the Pac-8s and I'd have
to say, 'Well, uh, 1 was hurt."'
Lofton likes to be No. I—the man to

beat —but he's getting antsy for interna
tional competition. He has never been a
member of an AAU team that has taken an
international trip, and last summer he
missed out on international competition
when he placed fifth at the Olympic trials,
not making the '76 Olympic team.
"By no means is the NCAA the biggest
meet in track," he said. "The NCAA is the
kids' meet, the men run AAU. The Pac-8
win wasn't that big a deal to me. None of
these meets seem that important any
more.
"It's like trick or treating. You've been
around your block once and it's no fun the
second time.
"I want to win at the National AAU
meet in June so I can make the U.S. team
and go to Europe because I want to win
over there."
Lofton said there is a psych out tactic in
the long jump.
Thinking about it
"In the long jump you're competing
against yourself," he said. "If you're
doing that when the competition is tough,
you'll do well. If somebody jumps far and
you worry too much, it'll just destroy you.
"Like me and Willie Banks were talking
at the Pac-Bs. He jumps real good. He's a
good technician. He said, 'Man, how do
you guys do it? How do you just unload
when you have to?' And I said, 'Willie,
don't worry about it. You're doing good.'
The next day he goes out and jumps 55-3
y 4 —the best jump in the world and the
stadium record for the fourth time.
"Doubley takes the whole thing too
seriously. When I moved ahead of him at
the Pac-8s he sat on the ground praying.
I've seen a lot of people disappointed.
There's just no reason —you do the best
you can and after that what else is there?"
Lofton is loose and relaxed on the track.
"For me the highest point in sports isn't
winning," he said. "It's having fun. Say if
somebody wins every meet and they're
not satisfied, well, that's not your whole
life. It's a big part, but you have to live
after the meet is over."
Lofton has watched films of his jumps
as well as his 400 meter races and been a
little disappointed.
"I've got a mental image of myself," he
said. "But there is no difference in the
way I look when I jump 25-8 or 26-9. The
same in the 400. I thought some of my

fastest runs would look really fluid. But
they don't.
"When I'm running I can feel my
technique—like my knees coming up and
my stride extended. 1 feel fluid. To run
perfect it would be like running water —it
just goes. When you compete, it would be
really good if you could compete at your
highest level and isolate your com
petitors. It would be good if you could run
alone in the dark and actually feel your
self run. You wouldn't be able to look
around. You'd have to sense the other
guys more with your body. You'd be more
aware of what your own body was doing."
One of the top two-sport stars in the
nation, Lofton is being scouted heavily by
pro football teams as a wide receiver. Last
season he caught 12 passes—four of
which were touchdowns. His speed and
quick moves have prompted football
coach Bill Walsh to liken him to Isaac
Curtis of the Cincinnati Bengals.
"Which would I choose, green bucks or
an Olympic gold medal?" Lofton asked.
"I know the people who have won four
out of the last five gold medals and every
one of them told me to play pro football. I
guess it's a choice they never had—
something they couldn't do.
Conditioning in football?
"In football I don't train anywhere near
the way 1 do in track. Bring them (football
players) all out to the track. Track will
kick you in the tail.
"Just now I'm realizing how violent
football really is. I've escaped being hit
really hard. To tell you the truth, I'm tired
after I run two plays. All that hitting and
rolling off the ground. After about five
plays I look over to the sideline and think,
'Substition?'"
Has Lofton ever sat back and marveled
at his athletic success?
"Almost," he admitted. "But I want to
get better. When you finally sit back it
seems like the end of it. It's like painting a
picture. You wouldn't stop in the middle
and say, 'Wow, this is going to be a really
great piece of art.' You have to keep work
ing.
"I figure as long as every year I come
out and can say that I feel a little bit faster
and a little bit stronger, then I'll stick at it.
But the year I come out and say, 'Wow, I
felt better last year,' that's the year I re
tire."

James Lofton is on top of things. This
season, the junior from Los Angeles, has
the world's best mark in the long jump—
26-9. The jump, which came last March in
Mexico City, put Lofton into third place
as the best jump recorded by a Pac-8 per
former.
Last Friday, Lofton captured the Pac-8
long jump crown with a jump of 26-4 3 / 4 .
The week prior to the Pac-Bs, he injured
his hamstring and there was some doubt
among track fans about whether he would
be able to unload against his two biggest
rivals—USC's Larry Doubley and UCLA's
Willie Banks.
Lofton said for any athlete to be suc
cessful, it takes "the fourTs—technique,
training, timing and talent." But Lofton
has a secret weapon of which none of the
other world-class jumpers can boast—his
father, who himself was a successful col
legiate long jumper and quarter miler.
"At the Stanford relays, he sat up in the
stands just screaming at the top of his
lungs, 'Get up, James! Jump! Jump boy!"'

said, 'Shit. 1 can see it in the papers: "Lof
ton bombs out.'" People would ask me
what happened in the Pac-8s and I'd have
to say, 'Well, uh, 1 was hurt."'
Lofton likes to be No. I—the man to

beat —but he's getting antsy for interna
tional competition. He has never been a
member of an AAU team that has taken an
international trip, and last summer he
missed out on international competition
when he placed fifth at the Olympic trials,
not making the '76 Olympic team.
"By no means is the NCAA the biggest
meet in track," he said. "The NCAA is the
kids' meet, the men run AAU. The Pac-8
win wasn't that big a deal to me. None of
these meets seem that important any
more.
"It's like trick or treating. You've been
around your block once and it's no fun the
second time.
"I want to win at the National AAU
meet in June so I can make the U.S. team
and go to Europe because I want to win
over there."
Lofton said there is a psych out tactic in
the long jump.
Thinking about it
"In the long jump you're competing
against yourself," he said. "If you're
doing that when the competition is tough,
you'll do well. If somebody jumps far and
you worry too much, it'll just destroy you.
"Like me and Willie Banks were talking
at the Pac-Bs. He jumps real good. He's a
good technician. He said, 'Man, how do
you guys do it? How do you just unload
when you have to?' And I said, 'Willie,
don't worry about it. You're doing good.'
The next day he goes out and jumps 55-3
y 4 —the best jump in the world and the
stadium record for the fourth time.
"Doubley takes the whole thing too
seriously. When I moved ahead of him at
the Pac-8s he sat on the ground praying.
I've seen a lot of people disappointed.
There's just no reason —you do the best
you can and after that what else is there?"
Lofton is loose and relaxed on the track.
"For me the highest point in sports isn't
winning," he said. "It's having fun. Say if
somebody wins every meet and they're
not satisfied, well, that's not your whole
life. It's a big part, but you have to live
after the meet is over."
Lofton has watched films of his jumps
as well as his 400 meter races and been a
little disappointed.
"I've got a mental image of myself," he
said. "But there is no difference in the
way I look when I jump 25-8 or 26-9. The
same in the 400. I thought some of my

fastest runs would look really fluid. But
they don't.
"When I'm running I can feel my
technique—like my knees coming up and
my stride extended. 1 feel fluid. To run
perfect it would be like running water —it
just goes. When you compete, it would be
really good if you could compete at your
highest level and isolate your com
petitors. It would be good if you could run
alone in the dark and actually feel your
self run. You wouldn't be able to look
around. You'd have to sense the other
guys more with your body. You'd be more
aware of what your own body was doing."
One of the top two-sport stars in the
nation, Lofton is being scouted heavily by
pro football teams as a wide receiver. Last
season he caught 12 passes—four of
which were touchdowns. His speed and
quick moves have prompted football
coach Bill Walsh to liken him to Isaac
Curtis of the Cincinnati Bengals.
"Which would I choose, green bucks or
an Olympic gold medal?" Lofton asked.
"I know the people who have won four
out of the last five gold medals and every
one of them told me to play pro football. I
guess it's a choice they never had—
something they couldn't do.
Conditioning in football?
"In football I don't train anywhere near
the way 1 do in track. Bring them (football
players) all out to the track. Track will
kick you in the tail.
"Just now I'm realizing how violent
football really is. I've escaped being hit
really hard. To tell you the truth, I'm tired
after I run two plays. All that hitting and
rolling off the ground. After about five
plays I look over to the sideline and think,
'Substition?'"
Has Lofton ever sat back and marveled
at his athletic success?
"Almost," he admitted. "But I want to
get better. When you finally sit back it
seems like the end of it. It's like painting a
picture. You wouldn't stop in the middle
and say, 'Wow, this is going to be a really
great piece of art.' You have to keep work
ing.
"I figure as long as every year I come
out and can say that I feel a little bit faster
and a little bit stronger, then I'll stick at it.
But the year I come out and say, 'Wow, I
felt better last year,' that's the year I re
tire."

James Lofton
James Lofton is on top of things. This
season, the junior from Los Angeles, has
the world's best mark in the long jump—
26-9. The jump, which came last March in
Mexico City, put Lofton into third place
as the best jump recorded by a Pac-8 per
former.
Last Friday, Lofton captured the Pac-8
long jump crown with a jump of 26-4 3 / 4 .
The week prior to the Pac-Bs, he injured
his hamstring and there was some doubt
among track fans about whether he would
be able to unload against his two biggest
rivals—USC's Larry Doubley and UCLA's
Willie Banks.
Lofton said for any athlete to be suc
cessful, it takes "the fourTs—technique,
training, timing and talent." But Lofton
has a secret weapon of which none of the
other world-class jumpers can boast—his
father, who himself was a successful col
legiate long jumper and quarter miler.
"At the Stanford relays, he sat up in the
stands just screaming at the top of his
lungs, 'Get up, James! Jump! Jump boy!"'
said Lofton of his father. "I was running
down the runway and I could hear him
yelling. When Willie Banks (owner of the
best triple jump mark in the world this
season) beat me down at UCLA, I had just
finished jumping my last jump. Banks
had one more jump. Then 1 hear this voice
in the stands yelling. 'Save yourself, Wil
lie. Don't jump anymore. Save yourself
for the triple jump.'
"When Gerald Hardeman of USC beat
m£ my freshman year, he was running
down the runway and my father was
screaming, 'Fall down, Gerald.'
Doesn't a screaming madman like that
make Lofton nervous?
Nerves of steel
"You may find this hard to believe,"
Lofton began, "but 1 don't get nervous.
The first time ever was last weekend at the
Pac-8 meet and I think it was because I
was semi-hurt.
"1 jumped 24 feet on the first jump and I
said, 'Man, what's wrong? Shit, I'm nerv
ous.' On the second jump I just ran
through the pit, my step was so off. And I

Lofton said there is a psych out tactic in
the long jump.
Thinking about it
"In the long jump you're competing
against yourself," he said. "If you're
doing that when the competition is tough,
you'll do well. If somebody jumps far and
you worry too much, it'll just destroy you.
"Like me and Willie Banks were talking
at the Pac-Bs. He jumps real good. He's a
good technician. He said, 'Man, how do
you guys do it? How do you just unload
when you have to?' And I said, 'Willie,
don't worry about it. You're doing good.'
The next day he goes out and jumps 55-3
y 4 —the best jump in the world and the
stadium record for the fourth time.
"Doubley takes the whole thing too
seriously. When I moved ahead of him at
the Pac-8s he sat on the ground praying.
I've seen a lot of people disappointed.
There's just no reason —you do the best
you can and after that what else is there?"
Lofton is loose and relaxed on the track.
"For me the highest point in sports isn't
winning," he said. "It's having fun. Say if
somebody wins every meet and they're
not satisfied, well, that's not your whole
life. It's a big part, but you have to live
after the meet is over."
Lofton has watched films of his jumps
as well as his 400 meter races and been a
little disappointed.
"I've got a mental image of myself," he
said. "But there is no difference in the
way I look when I jump 25-8 or 26-9. The
same in the 400. I thought some of my

fastest runs would look really fluid. But
they don't.
"When I'm running I can feel my
technique—like my knees coming up and
my stride extended. 1 feel fluid. To run
perfect it would be like running water —it
just goes. When you compete, it would be
really good if you could compete at your
highest level and isolate your com
petitors. It would be good if you could run
alone in the dark and actually feel your
self run. You wouldn't be able to look
around. You'd have to sense the other
guys more with your body. You'd be more
aware of what your own body was doing."
One of the top two-sport stars in the
nation, Lofton is being scouted heavily by
pro football teams as a wide receiver. Last
season he caught 12 passes—four of
which were touchdowns. His speed and
quick moves have prompted football
coach Bill Walsh to liken him to Isaac
Curtis of the Cincinnati Bengals.
"Which would I choose, green bucks or
an Olympic gold medal?" Lofton asked.
"I know the people who have won four
out of the last five gold medals and every
one of them told me to play pro football. I
guess it's a choice they never had—
something they couldn't do.
Conditioning in football?
"In football I don't train anywhere near
the way 1 do in track. Bring them (football
players) all out to the track. Track will
kick you in the tail.
"Just now I'm realizing how violent
football really is. I've escaped being hit
really hard. To tell you the truth, I'm tired
after I run two plays. All that hitting and
rolling off the ground. After about five
plays I look over to the sideline and think,
'Substition?'"
Has Lofton ever sat back and marveled
at his athletic success?
"Almost," he admitted. "But I want to
get better. When you finally sit back it
seems like the end of it. It's like painting a
picture. You wouldn't stop in the middle
and say, 'Wow, this is going to be a really
great piece of art.' You have to keep work
ing.
"I figure as long as every year I come
out and can say that I feel a little bit faster
and a little bit stronger, then I'll stick at it.
But the year I come out and say, 'Wow, I
felt better last year,' that's the year I re
tire."
