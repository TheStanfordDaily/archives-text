Nixon promised aid to N. Vietnam
Washington — Richard Nixon secretly committed
the United States four years ago to $3.25 billion in
post-war aid for Vietnam but he now believes ful
fillment of that pledge would be unjustified and
immoral, according to documents released yester
day.
In a 1973 Nixon message to North Vietnamese
authorities, released simultaneously yesterday by
the State Department and by Rep. Lester Wolff (D-
N.Y.), the former president promised the U.S. post
war aid "without any political conditions."
Wolff also released a letter Nixon wrote him last
Saturday in which Nixon said he could think of "no
action which would be less justified or more im
moral than to provide any aid whatever to the Hanoi
government in light of their flagrant violations of the
Paris peace accords."
Wolff, chairman of the House subcommittee on

Asian affairs, and several House colleagues said the
two documents suggest that former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and his predecessor, William
Rogers, lied to Congress about the existence of the
agreement.
Wolff said the two documents make clear that the
Congress and the American people were "consis
tently misled as to the existence of any secret negoti
ations, much less as to the actual content of the
agreements."
Release of the original Nixon message to North
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong settles
one of the lingering mysteries about the terms of the
January 1973 Paris peace agreement.
U.S., Soviets discuss arms treaty
Geneva, Switzerland — Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
were reported yesterday to be working on a com
promise formula to break the deadlock over a new
treaty limiting strategic nuclear weapons.
After more than five hours of what U.S. officials
described as "intensive" and "good faith" negotia
tions, an overnight recess was taken to allow
Gromyko to contact the Kremlin for instructions.
Vance also was in touch with President Jimmy Car
ter.
Asked by reporters how the arms talks were going,
Gromyko replied in Russian, "It will become clearer
today or tomorrow."
Informed sources said the compromise formula
would blend U.S. proposals rejected in March by
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev with a modified
Soviet proposal.
Middle East situation discussed
Geneva, Switzerland — Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko said yesterday after meeting with

U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that the Middle
East situation is "potentially dangerous."
He told reporters after the nearly two-hour meet
ing that both sides believe the situation there "is not
normal."
The victorious Israeli right-wing has advocated
annexation of the occupied West Bank of the Jordan
River.
The Soviets have long called for Israeli withdraw
als from war-won Arab lands and an early reconven
ing of the Geneva peace conference.
Asked if Gromyko had stated his views with any
more urgency than usual to Vance, U.S. spokesman
Hodding Carter, replied: "no."
The spokesman said "the talks were not con
ducted in an atmosphere of crisis or sudden re
evaluation."
In a joint communique planned for tomorrow, the
two powers reportedly will agree to meet periodi
cally on a high level to review the Middle East situa
tion.
Chinese, French oppose nuclear ban
Washington — The Carter administration has
tried but failed to win Chinese and French backing
for a world ban on all nuclear weapon test-shots.
Qualified diplomats, reporting yesterday, said the
Peking government has declined the U.S. proposal
and has said it intends to continue test-firing nuclear
arms.
The Chinese have long argued that U.S.-Soviet
attempts to stop tests and to limit strategic weapons
add up to a super-power design to preserve their
nuclear supremacy.
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, under
Gaullist political pressure at home, also has made
clear to the Carter administration he is unlikely at
this time to agree to a total ban on nuclear tests.
France, like China, also has refused to sign the world
pact to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, known as
the nonproliferation treaty.
UC regents address apartheid
San Francisco — The investment committee of the
University of California regents agreed yesterday to
dispatch a letter to companies with UC investments
"to convey our deep feelings about apartheid" in
South Africa.
The proposal by regents chairman William Cob
lentz came on the same day a noisy group of 40
students disrupted the finance committee meeting
with angry demands that the university withdraw
funds from all companies doing business in racially
segregated South Africa.
Regent Earl Willens arranged a meeting between
demonstrators and some members of the investment
committee for Tuesday.
Today's weather
Low clouds along the coast nights and mornings
extending locally inland. Otherwise fair through
tomorrow with sunny days. A little warmer days.
Lows tonight in the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the
mid 70s.

the nonproliferation treaty.
UC regents address apartheid
San Francisco — The investment committee of the
University of California regents agreed yesterday to
dispatch a letter to companies with UC investments
"to convey our deep feelings about apartheid" in
South Africa.
The proposal by regents chairman William Cob
lentz came on the same day a noisy group of 40
students disrupted the finance committee meeting
with angry demands that the university withdraw
funds from all companies doing business in racially
segregated South Africa.
Regent Earl Willens arranged a meeting between
demonstrators and some members of the investment
committee for Tuesday.
Today's weather
Low clouds along the coast nights and mornings
extending locally inland. Otherwise fair through
tomorrow with sunny days. A little warmer days.
Lows tonight in the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the
mid 70s.
Nixon promised aid to N. Vietnam
Washington — Richard Nixon secretly committed
the United States four years ago to $3.25 billion in
post-war aid for Vietnam but he now believes ful
fillment of that pledge would be unjustified and
immoral, according to documents released yester
day.
In a 1973 Nixon message to North Vietnamese
authorities, released simultaneously yesterday by
the State Department and by Rep. Lester Wolff (D-
N.Y.), the former president promised the U.S. post
war aid "without any political conditions."
Wolff also released a letter Nixon wrote him last
Saturday in which Nixon said he could think of "no
action which would be less justified or more im
moral than to provide any aid whatever to the Hanoi
government in light of their flagrant violations of the
Paris peace accords."
Wolff, chairman of the House subcommittee on

Asian affairs, and several House colleagues said the
two documents suggest that former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and his predecessor, William
Rogers, lied to Congress about the existence of the
agreement.
Wolff said the two documents make clear that the
Congress and the American people were "consis
tently misled as to the existence of any secret negoti
ations, much less as to the actual content of the
agreements."
Release of the original Nixon message to North
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong settles
one of the lingering mysteries about the terms of the
January 1973 Paris peace agreement.
U.S., Soviets discuss arms treaty
Geneva, Switzerland — Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
were reported yesterday to be working on a com
promise formula to break the deadlock over a new
treaty limiting strategic nuclear weapons.
After more than five hours of what U.S. officials
described as "intensive" and "good faith" negotia
tions, an overnight recess was taken to allow
Gromyko to contact the Kremlin for instructions.
Vance also was in touch with President Jimmy Car
ter.
Asked by reporters how the arms talks were going,
Gromyko replied in Russian, "It will become clearer
today or tomorrow."
Informed sources said the compromise formula
would blend U.S. proposals rejected in March by
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev with a modified
Soviet proposal.
Middle East situation discussed
Geneva, Switzerland — Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko said yesterday after meeting with

U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that the Middle
East situation is "potentially dangerous."
He told reporters after the nearly two-hour meet
ing that both sides believe the situation there "is not
normal."
The victorious Israeli right-wing has advocated
annexation of the occupied West Bank of the Jordan
River.
The Soviets have long called for Israeli withdraw
als from war-won Arab lands and an early reconven
ing of the Geneva peace conference.
Asked if Gromyko had stated his views with any
more urgency than usual to Vance, U.S. spokesman
Hodding Carter, replied: "no."
The spokesman said "the talks were not con
ducted in an atmosphere of crisis or sudden re
evaluation."
In a joint communique planned for tomorrow, the
two powers reportedly will agree to meet periodi
cally on a high level to review the Middle East situa
tion.
Chinese, French oppose nuclear ban
Washington — The Carter administration has
tried but failed to win Chinese and French backing
for a world ban on all nuclear weapon test-shots.
Qualified diplomats, reporting yesterday, said the
Peking government has declined the U.S. proposal
and has said it intends to continue test-firing nuclear
arms.
The Chinese have long argued that U.S.-Soviet
attempts to stop tests and to limit strategic weapons
add up to a super-power design to preserve their
nuclear supremacy.
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, under
Gaullist political pressure at home, also has made
clear to the Carter administration he is unlikely at
this time to agree to a total ban on nuclear tests.
France, like China, also has refused to sign the world
pact to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, known as
the nonproliferation treaty.
