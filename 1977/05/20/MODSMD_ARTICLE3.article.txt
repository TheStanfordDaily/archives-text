# 43 code violations charged at hospital
## 
### 
By Kurt Cobb
Serious sanitation, drug storage and
|»ed space problems at the Stanford
Hospital are cited in a report of the
State Department of Health obtained
by the Daily.
The report lists 43 separate areas in
which the hospital does not meet re
quirements of the California adminis
trative code.
The Health Department can issue or
deny licenses to hospitals.
Hospital officials said they had not
received the reports and refused to
comment on its content. The report is
based on an inspection of the hosptial
performed earlier this year.
The Joint Committee on Hospital
Accreditation (JCHA) also inspected
the hospital then, and has already is
sued its report.
Many changes
Many changes in procedures and
conditions have been made since that
report came out, according to James
McNally, vice president of medical af
fairs. Fifty per cent of the recommen
dations have been acted on, McNally
said.
The JCHA gave the hospital a one
year accreditation this year instead of
the usual two years. The hospital re
ceived one-year accreditations in 1975
and 1976 also.
The report said, "Clean linen was
noted being received on the same load
ing dock along side the garbage and
trash collection refuse boxes, (and)
transported via the same corridors as
laboratory animals, contaminated in
fectious waste and contaminated
soiled linens."
The report also said garbage units on
the main loading dock, where "all in
coming supplies for the hospital are
received," leak and there are not ap
propriate facilities for cleaning the
units or the leakage which spills onto
the docks.
Susceptible to theft
Doors to pharmacies were reported
left open or unlocked, thus being sus

ceptible to theft and unauthorized use.
Some drugs in the pharmacies were
outdated by two years or more, accord
ing to the report.
Hiram Sera, director of pharmacies,
said the problem with the expired
drugs "was basically a fluke" and that
more frequent inspections are being
made to prevent a recurrence.
He added that although pharmacy
doors may be left open during busi ness
hours, the doors are locked whenever
the pharmacist leaves and after 5 p.m.
He said the hospital is complying with
all federal and state laws "as far as
security (of drugs) goes."
McNally said the loading dock area
has been partitioned into "clean" and
"dirty" areas in accordance with re
commendations of accreditation offi
cials. He said all food deliveries are
now made on the first floor level and
all garbage and refuse leaves at the
ground level.
'Clean' and 'dirty'
McNally said the problem of sepa
rate "clean" and "dirty" areas
throughout the hospital has been sol
ved, a problem also stressed in the
state's report.

The Department of Health report
noted several problems with medical
records. Doctors often failed to sign
orders, initially given verbally, for
drugs for their patients.
The report said that two weeks after
the discharge of such patients, 60 per
cent still had not had the orders for
drugs on their records signed by the
attending physician, a procedure
which is supposed to be completed
within 48 hours.
The report also said that due to in
adequate space there is a "considera
ble delay" for physicians in obtaining
a patient's records. It added that pa
tient records are required to be com
pleted and signed by a physician
within two weeks of a patient's dis
charge. The records of 2510 patients
were delinquent as of Jan. 18, 1977.
In compliance
McNally said a faster "turnaround
and sign-off" of medical records has
been accomplished and that as of last
week the hospital was in compliance
with all regulations concerning medi
cal records.
The report said bed space for acute
respiratory care, intensive care, coro
nary care and intensive care for new
born babies was inadequate. It also
said the hospital lacks sufficient stor
age space and that "bulk warehouse
lots" were being left in corridors, pa
tient rooms and utility areas.
While the hospital has increased its
capacity and outpatient services it
"has not increased the size of the orig
inal kitchen to keep pace with addi
tional requirements," according to the
report.
In fact, the hospital has closed its
Hoover Pavilion kitchen and the food

carts used for transporting food to the
building do not meet the proper re
quirements.
Paul Levin, associate vice president
for medical affairs, said the state in
spection was made while the hospital
was in the process of opening a new
building. This may account for the in
creased clutter in the corridors and
around the perimeter of the hospital,
he said.
The confidential report will be re
ceived by the hospital today and state
officials will be asking the hospital to
come up with specific proposals to re
ctify the problems.

drugs on their records signed by the
attending physician, a procedure
which is supposed to be completed
within 48 hours.
The report also said that due to in
adequate space there is a "considera
ble delay" for physicians in obtaining
a patient's records. It added that pa
tient records are required to be com
pleted and signed by a physician
within two weeks of a patient's dis
charge. The records of 2510 patients
were delinquent as of Jan. 18, 1977.
In compliance
McNally said a faster "turnaround
and sign-off" of medical records has
been accomplished and that as of last
week the hospital was in compliance
with all regulations concerning medi
cal records.
The report said bed space for acute
respiratory care, intensive care, coro
nary care and intensive care for new
born babies was inadequate. It also
said the hospital lacks sufficient stor
age space and that "bulk warehouse
lots" were being left in corridors, pa
tient rooms and utility areas.
While the hospital has increased its
capacity and outpatient services it
"has not increased the size of the orig
inal kitchen to keep pace with addi
tional requirements," according to the
report.
In fact, the hospital has closed its
Hoover Pavilion kitchen and the food

carts used for transporting food to the
building do not meet the proper re
quirements.
Paul Levin, associate vice president
for medical affairs, said the state in
spection was made while the hospital
was in the process of opening a new
building. This may account for the in
creased clutter in the corridors and
around the perimeter of the hospital,
he said.
The confidential report will be re
ceived by the hospital today and state
officials will be asking the hospital to
come up with specific proposals to re
ctify the problems.

Serious sanitation, drug storage and
|»ed space problems at the Stanford
Hospital are cited in a report of the
State Department of Health obtained
by the Daily.
The report lists 43 separate areas in
which the hospital does not meet re
quirements of the California adminis
trative code.
The Health Department can issue or
deny licenses to hospitals.
Hospital officials said they had not
received the reports and refused to
comment on its content. The report is
based on an inspection of the hosptial
performed earlier this year.
The Joint Committee on Hospital
Accreditation (JCHA) also inspected
the hospital then, and has already is
sued its report.
Many changes
Many changes in procedures and
conditions have been made since that
report came out, according to James
McNally, vice president of medical af
fairs. Fifty per cent of the recommen
dations have been acted on, McNally
said.
The JCHA gave the hospital a one
year accreditation this year instead of
the usual two years. The hospital re
ceived one-year accreditations in 1975
and 1976 also.
The report said, "Clean linen was
noted being received on the same load
ing dock along side the garbage and
trash collection refuse boxes, (and)
transported via the same corridors as
laboratory animals, contaminated in
fectious waste and contaminated
soiled linens."
The report also said garbage units on
the main loading dock, where "all in
coming supplies for the hospital are
received," leak and there are not ap
propriate facilities for cleaning the
units or the leakage which spills onto
the docks.
Susceptible to theft
Doors to pharmacies were reported
left open or unlocked, thus being sus

ceptible to theft and unauthorized use.
Some drugs in the pharmacies were
outdated by two years or more, accord
ing to the report.
Hiram Sera, director of pharmacies,
said the problem with the expired
drugs "was basically a fluke" and that
more frequent inspections are being
made to prevent a recurrence.
He added that although pharmacy
doors may be left open during busi ness
hours, the doors are locked whenever
the pharmacist leaves and after 5 p.m.
He said the hospital is complying with
all federal and state laws "as far as
security (of drugs) goes."
McNally said the loading dock area
has been partitioned into "clean" and
"dirty" areas in accordance with re
commendations of accreditation offi
cials. He said all food deliveries are
now made on the first floor level and
all garbage and refuse leaves at the
ground level.
'Clean' and 'dirty'
McNally said the problem of sepa
rate "clean" and "dirty" areas
throughout the hospital has been sol
ved, a problem also stressed in the
state's report.

The Department of Health report
noted several problems with medical
records. Doctors often failed to sign
orders, initially given verbally, for
drugs for their patients.
The report said that two weeks after
the discharge of such patients, 60 per

drugs on their records signed by the
