In an open meeting of a subcommittee for the
Committee on Graduate Studies (C-GS), member
Warren Seering said it seems very likely the commit
tee will endorse the current system of department
control for University fellowships.
Seering noted that financial need is being taken
into consideration by more departments.
At the present time departments decide how to
award fellowships, within certain constraints set by
Dean of Graduate Studies, W. Bliss Carnochan.
Carnochan said departments are given the "bot
tom line" of the financial aid form by the Graduate
and Professional Schools Financial Aids Service
(GAPSFAS). Departments then use this form as they
desire, but cannot give less than the support
suggested by the GAPSFAS form.
Carnochan said more departments are now using a
financial need formula when determining student
aid, with 16 of 23 humanities and social science
departments now taking financial status into con
sideration to some degree.
Seering said affirmation of the current system
would set financial need as a legitimate criteria for
computing financial aid.
Carnochan assured the people present that no
graduate programs would be eliminated in order to
increase the money available for each candidate.
But Carnochan warned, "There are never going to
be easy times in the graduate division again."
