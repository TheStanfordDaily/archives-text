# The
						Young Volume
## Daily elects editor 
### 
The Stanford Daily's Southern
beau, Jacob Young, was elected
editor of the Daily's Volume 172
yesterday.
It is rumored that the lanky junior
from Chattanooga, Tenn., cam
paigned on the slogan "Jimmy and
Jake. The South on the make."
Young, bom in Chickamauga,
Ga., promises to improve relations
between the Daily and the White
House because "Georgia boys stick
together."
Young, who claims to be "5-
foot-17," says his height will help
him during his reign as Daily editor
next fall.
"I've always felt my height was
one of my big advantages, and the
only person that really frightens me
is (Dean of Admissions) Fred Har
gadon." The dean is 6-foot-7 and
plays catcher and first base—
simultaneously—for the administ
ration softball team.
Young says he will resurrect
Thursday, a tabloid replacing the
Daily's regular Thursday issue.
Young described Thursday as a
"weekly newsmagazine with spe
cial emphasis on in-depth reporting
and a complete entertainment sec
tion." Thursday was published last
year but was discontinued this fall.
He also said, "The flag will go."
Young says he will survive his
volume by relying on his Latvian-
Canadian managing editor, George
Anders, and his old standby, Wild
Turkey.
He credits his victory to Wild
Turkey and being an advisee of His
tory Prof. Lewis Spitz.
