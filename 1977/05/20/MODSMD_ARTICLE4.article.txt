# President above law, Nixon says to Frost

### 
Washington (AP) â€” Richard Nixon
says a president is above the law not
only when national security is at stake,
but also when internal peace and order
are threatened.
"When the president does it, that
means it is not illegal," Nixon said in
the third of a series of television inter
views last night.
"The president's decision in that in
stance, is one that enables those who
carry out an order to carry it out with
out violating a law," he added.

"Otherwise, they're in an impossible
position."
Nixon's statement, made while he
was discussing covert actions against
Vietnam war protesters, runs counter
to court decisions that held his aides
liable for crimes, even though they
claimed presidential sanction. The
Supreme Court, forcing hiin to give up
his tapes for trial evidence, came to the
same conclusion.
He also called Pentagon.papers
leaker Daniel Ellsberg a "punk" and
said he did not know in advance that
White House agents would break into
the office of psychiatrist Lewis Field
ing, who had treated Ellsberg. But,
Nixon added:
These two men
"The question is whether John
Ehrlichman informed me that these
two men were going to California. He
may well have. And, if he had, I would
have said 'Go right ahead.'"
Interviewer David Frost asked
whether Nixon had ordered a covert
investigation of the Brookings Insti
tute, a Washington think-tank.
"I have no recollection of authoriz
ing a break-in at Brookings," Nixon
replied. "If I had evidence that Brook
ings did have secret government
documents, if I had evidence that
somebody at Brookings was going to
put something out, I would have taken
very strong methods to get them back."
The first part of the interview fo
cused on the war in Vietnam and the
invasion of Cambodia but the former
president offered little that was not
known before.
Nixon reserved his bitterest com
ments for leakers.
If it had not been for leaks, Nixon
said, "the war in Vietnam would have
been brought to a conclusion sooner
than it was...their actions had the ef
fect of delaying the negotiations by
giving the enemy hope that they could
win in Washington diplomatically or
in Paris what they could not win on the
battlefield in Saigon."
