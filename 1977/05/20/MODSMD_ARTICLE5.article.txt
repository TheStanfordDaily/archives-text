### Jill Liscom 
After at least six recent incidents of
men being seen in women's lavatories
in Wilbur Hall, a meeting was held last
night for Wilbur staff members to
clarify reports and discuss ways to
combat the problem.
Several incidents have been re
ported in Junipero, Trancos and Ar
royo. Yesterday morning in Arroyo, a
black man was "taken into custody
when he came out of the bathroom"
said Sgt. Debbie Marinaro of the De
partment of Public Safety. According
to an Arroyo resident, the suspect was
seen by a cleaning woman who then
called the police.
The man was charged with a mis
demeanor, said Marinaro. The police
refused to release the suspect's name.
A white man with dark, curly hair
was found in a Junipero bathroom last
week, said Mary Jane Chase, a house
associate (RA).
"I asked him "what's the problem?'
and he told me he was sick, so I took
him over to Cowell," she explained.
A female Arroyo resident also re
ported seeing a white man with dark
curly hair in their lavatory three days
ago.

"I thought he was a maintenance
man and didn't do anything about it,"
she said.
After the third incident in Junipero
occurred Monday morning, a lock was
installed on the lavatory door that af
ternoon.
Both Marinaro and a representative
from Women Against Rape stressed
that if women find men in the lavatory,
they should "walk out as if there's no
thing wrong" and call police im
mediately at 911.
"Try to get a description, including
articles of clothing, and tell the officer
you'll meet him in a specific place,"
added Marinaro.
Several RAs also emphasized that
women should be aware of these inci
dents and know what to do in such
situations.
"New students come here and they
think no one will hurt them, so they
leave their doors unlocked," said
Marinaro. "This problem is not unique
to this dorm. The reason is that these
dorms are not secure. Men know they
can come here and find unlocked
doors and walk into rooms, or find
girls walking alone at night."
