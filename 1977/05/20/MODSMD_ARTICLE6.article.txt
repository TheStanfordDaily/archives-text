# Contrast seen in past, present demonstrations
## 
### Kim Hatamiya News analysis 
March 31, 1970: More than 150 anti-
ROTC demonstrators led police on a
merry-go-round chase all over campus.
About 100 windows were broken during
two hours of guerilla, hit-and-run attacks on
ROTC offices, the business school, and
aerospace buildings. Windows were also
broken in at least five other buildings.
The radicals' demonstration came in the
wake of a March 30 announcement of fa
culty approval of a limited ROTC academic
option. The procession began after a brief
discussion in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
where Tom Hayden, member of the
"Chicago Seven," had just spoken.
Anti-ROTC. Cuerilla attacks. Radicals.
Tom Hayden and the Chicago Seven. . . . All
these are a part of the "revolutionary
rhetoric" evoking memories of Stanford's
most turbulent year of student unrest,
1970
The radicals, guerilla tactics, and harried
police forces of 1970 are a far cry from the
organized, peaceful demonstration of May
10, 1977 protesting the University's in
vestments in South Africa. "Protest" may be
the strongest word of the far from "re
volutionary rhetoric" of the demonstrators

involved in the Old Union sit-in last week.
In a 1970 news analysis recapping anti-
ROTC and Cambodia invasion demonstra
tions, a Daily reporter observed that "many
of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins and
marches as the 'old' tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the 'new.' "
The "new" revolutionaries (where are
they now?) would probably have been dis
appointed with the regression of last week's
peaceful demonstration back to the "old"
ways.
Despite the violence which characterized
most of spring 1970, Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president of public affairs, feels there is
some similarity between last week's de
monstration and the beginnings of the
anti-war movement here.
"In spirit the early anti-war demonstra
tions were peaceful like the one last week,"
said Rosenzweig, "although later there was
a tendency toward violence.
"The 1969 Applied Electronics Laborat
ory sit-in against war research done at the
Stanford Research Institute was initially
quite peaceful, but eventually became more
radicalized and violent as issues became
more desperate," Rosenzweig remarked.
"As a result quite a few supporters of the
cause were lost.

"Yet when problems with the Cambodian
invasion entered the scene, the violence
was replaced by the original spirit of peace
ful demonstration," Rosenzweig added.
According to Rosenzweig, former Presi
dent Richard Nixon's decision affected stu
dents and faculty in new ways. "Protest at
Stanford then became a mass movement in
volving the organized efforts of large num
bers of peaceful, not hard-core political
types," he added.
The peaceful protest of last week's de
monstration may be reminiscent of early
sit-ins of the anti-war movement, yet the
intensity and urgency of the 1970 protests
were somehow missing from this spring's
demonstration.
The student unrest of 1970 was generally
a result of Nixon's order to invade Cam
bodia. His hard-line, cold-warish speech to
the nation on May 3, 1970 united students
in nationwide protest.
The spread of war in Indochina caused
students to react in demonstration, but the
actual cause of most campus sit-ins and vio
lence stemmed from on-campus issues.
A movement to discontinue the ROTC
program here preceded Stanford protest
against the invasion of Cambodia. In the
spring of 1969, the Faculty Senate had de

nied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and educa
tion," a decision which should have
doomed ROTC to a quick death.
In a puzzling reversal of the senate's ac
tion, President Kenneth Pitzer announced
in early January 1970 at an Academic Coun
cil meeting that a new contract providing
for limited ROTC credit had been
negotiated with the U.S. Army.
Pitzer strongly recommended that the
army limited credit plan be accepted by the
senate. On Jan. 22 the senate approved the
army proposal, but felt that a decision of
such importance should be voted upon by
all members of the faculty.
The results of a mail ballot distributed to
all faculty were announced March 30, with
the president and senate's approval upheld
by a narrow vote margin.
This action set the stage for the unor
ganized violence following Tom Hayden's
March 31 speech.
Seven nights of trashing on campus fol
lowed, with numerous police arrests.
After over a month of continual demonst
rations and violence, Pitzer asked the Fa
culty Senate to reconsider the entire issue of
ROTC at Stanford. A week later the faculty
body reversed itself for the second time

within little over a year, ending all ROTC
credit and narrowly deciding to delay con
sideration of whether officer training
should be on campus.
When asked whether the violence forced
Pitzer to ask the senate's reconsideration,
Rosenzweig replied, "A number of fac
tors were involved, not just the violence.
"Violence did have its impact then," said
Rosenzweig, "but any violence around this
year's demonstration would lose mass sup
port for the cause, in addition to faculty
support. Violence would have a detrimental
effect."
Rosenzweig commented, "I can see less
ideology in this present movement so far —
by ideology I mean some variation of Mar
xism.
If the impact of the demonstration against
South African investment is any less due to
its lack of violence, its skillful organization
compensates in effectiveness.
"Like the early anti-war organizers who
had a lot of prior experience from the civil
rights movement in the South, the peoplein
the forefront of this current demonstration
have learned a lot of good things from work
with such groups as United Farmworkers
and the David Harris campaign," said
Rosenzweig.

quite peaceful, but eventually became more
radicalized and violent as issues became
more desperate," Rosenzweig remarked.
"As a result quite a few supporters of the
cause were lost.

"Yet when problems with the Cambodian
invasion entered the scene, the violence
was replaced by the original spirit of peace
ful demonstration," Rosenzweig added.
According to Rosenzweig, former Presi
dent Richard Nixon's decision affected stu
dents and faculty in new ways. "Protest at
Stanford then became a mass movement in
volving the organized efforts of large num
bers of peaceful, not hard-core political
types," he added.
The peaceful protest of last week's de
monstration may be reminiscent of early
sit-ins of the anti-war movement, yet the
intensity and urgency of the 1970 protests
were somehow missing from this spring's
demonstration.
The student unrest of 1970 was generally
a result of Nixon's order to invade Cam
bodia. His hard-line, cold-warish speech to
the nation on May 3, 1970 united students
in nationwide protest.
The spread of war in Indochina caused
students to react in demonstration, but the
actual cause of most campus sit-ins and vio
lence stemmed from on-campus issues.
A movement to discontinue the ROTC
program here preceded Stanford protest
against the invasion of Cambodia. In the
spring of 1969, the Faculty Senate had de

nied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and educa
tion," a decision which should have
doomed ROTC to a quick death.
In a puzzling reversal of the senate's ac
tion, President Kenneth Pitzer announced
in early January 1970 at an Academic Coun
cil meeting that a new contract providing
for limited ROTC credit had been
negotiated with the U.S. Army.
Pitzer strongly recommended that the
army limited credit plan be accepted by the
senate. On Jan. 22 the senate approved the
army proposal, but felt that a decision of
such importance should be voted upon by
all members of the faculty.
The results of a mail ballot distributed to
all faculty were announced March 30, with
the president and senate's approval upheld
by a narrow vote margin.
This action set the stage for the unor
ganized violence following Tom Hayden's
March 31 speech.
Seven nights of trashing on campus fol
lowed, with numerous police arrests.
After over a month of continual demonst
rations and violence, Pitzer asked the Fa
culty Senate to reconsider the entire issue of
ROTC at Stanford. A week later the faculty
body reversed itself for the second time

within little over a year, ending all ROTC
credit and narrowly deciding to delay con
sideration of whether officer training
should be on campus.
When asked whether the violence forced
Pitzer to ask the senate's reconsideration,
Rosenzweig replied, "A number of fac
tors were involved, not just the violence.
"Violence did have its impact then," said
Rosenzweig, "but any violence around this
year's demonstration would lose mass sup
port for the cause, in addition to faculty
support. Violence would have a detrimental
effect."
Rosenzweig commented, "I can see less
ideology in this present movement so far —
by ideology I mean some variation of Mar
xism.
If the impact of the demonstration against
South African investment is any less due to
its lack of violence, its skillful organization
compensates in effectiveness.
"Like the early anti-war organizers who
had a lot of prior experience from the civil
rights movement in the South, the peoplein
the forefront of this current demonstration
have learned a lot of good things from work
with such groups as United Farmworkers
and the David Harris campaign," said
Rosenzweig.
March 31, 1970: More than 150 anti-
ROTC demonstrators led police on a
merry-go-round chase all over campus.
About 100 windows were broken during
two hours of guerilla, hit-and-run attacks on
ROTC offices, the business school, and
aerospace buildings. Windows were also
broken in at least five other buildings.
The radicals' demonstration came in the
wake of a March 30 announcement of fa
culty approval of a limited ROTC academic
option. The procession began after a brief
discussion in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
where Tom Hayden, member of the
"Chicago Seven," had just spoken.

10, 1977 protesting the University's in

the strongest word of the far from "re

ROTC and Cambodia invasion demonstra
tions, a Daily reporter observed that "many
of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins and
marches as the 'old' tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the 'new.' "
The "new" revolutionaries (where are
they now?) would probably have been dis
appointed with the regression of last week's
peaceful demonstration back to the "old"
ways.

most of spring 1970, Robert Rosenzweig,

March 31 speech.
Seven nights of trashing on campus fol
lowed, with numerous police arrests.
After over a month of continual demonst
rations and violence, Pitzer asked the Fa
culty Senate to reconsider the entire issue of
ROTC at Stanford. A week later the faculty
body reversed itself for the second time

within little over a year, ending all ROTC
credit and narrowly deciding to delay con
sideration of whether officer training
should be on campus.
When asked whether the violence forced
Pitzer to ask the senate's reconsideration,
Rosenzweig replied, "A number of fac
tors were involved, not just the violence.
"Violence did have its impact then," said
Rosenzweig, "but any violence around this
year's demonstration would lose mass sup
port for the cause, in addition to faculty
support. Violence would have a detrimental
effect."
Rosenzweig commented, "I can see less
ideology in this present movement so far —
by ideology I mean some variation of Mar
xism.
If the impact of the demonstration against
South African investment is any less due to
its lack of violence, its skillful organization
compensates in effectiveness.
"Like the early anti-war organizers who
had a lot of prior experience from the civil
rights movement in the South, the peoplein
the forefront of this current demonstration
have learned a lot of good things from work
with such groups as United Farmworkers
and the David Harris campaign," said
Rosenzweig.
March 31, 1970: More than 150 anti-
ROTC demonstrators led police on a
merry-go-round chase all over campus.
About 100 windows were broken during
two hours of guerilla, hit-and-run attacks on
ROTC offices, the business school, and
aerospace buildings. Windows were also
broken in at least five other buildings.
The radicals' demonstration came in the
wake of a March 30 announcement of fa
culty approval of a limited ROTC academic
option. The procession began after a brief
discussion in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
where Tom Hayden, member of the
"Chicago Seven," had just spoken.
Anti-ROTC. Cuerilla attacks. Radicals.
Tom Hayden and the Chicago Seven. . . . All
these are a part of the "revolutionary
rhetoric" evoking memories of Stanford's
most turbulent year of student unrest,
1970
The radicals, guerilla tactics, and harried
police forces of 1970 are a far cry from the
organized, peaceful demonstration of May
10, 1977 protesting the University's in
vestments in South Africa. "Protest" may be
the strongest word of the far from "re
volutionary rhetoric" of the demonstrators

involved in the Old Union sit-in last week.
In a 1970 news analysis recapping anti-
ROTC and Cambodia invasion demonstra
tions, a Daily reporter observed that "many
of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins and
marches as the 'old' tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the 'new.' "
The "new" revolutionaries (where are
they now?) would probably have been dis
appointed with the regression of last week's
peaceful demonstration back to the "old"
ways.
Despite the violence which characterized
most of spring 1970, Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president of public affairs, feels there is
some similarity between last week's de
monstration and the beginnings of the
anti-war movement here.
"In spirit the early anti-war demonstra
tions were peaceful like the one last week,"
said Rosenzweig, "although later there was
a tendency toward violence.
"The 1969 Applied Electronics Laborat
ory sit-in against war research done at the
Stanford Research Institute was initially
quite peaceful, but eventually became more
radicalized and violent as issues became
more desperate," Rosenzweig remarked.
"As a result quite a few supporters of the
cause were lost.

"Yet when problems with the Cambodian
invasion entered the scene, the violence
was replaced by the original spirit of peace
ful demonstration," Rosenzweig added.
According to Rosenzweig, former Presi
dent Richard Nixon's decision affected stu
dents and faculty in new ways. "Protest at
Stanford then became a mass movement in
volving the organized efforts of large num
bers of peaceful, not hard-core political
types," he added.
The peaceful protest of last week's de
monstration may be reminiscent of early
sit-ins of the anti-war movement, yet the
intensity and urgency of the 1970 protests
were somehow missing from this spring's
demonstration.
The student unrest of 1970 was generally
a result of Nixon's order to invade Cam
bodia. His hard-line, cold-warish speech to
the nation on May 3, 1970 united students
in nationwide protest.
The spread of war in Indochina caused
students to react in demonstration, but the
actual cause of most campus sit-ins and vio
lence stemmed from on-campus issues.
A movement to discontinue the ROTC
program here preceded Stanford protest
against the invasion of Cambodia. In the
spring of 1969, the Faculty Senate had de

nied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and educa
tion," a decision which should have
doomed ROTC to a quick death.
In a puzzling reversal of the senate's ac
tion, President Kenneth Pitzer announced
in early January 1970 at an Academic Coun
cil meeting that a new contract providing
for limited ROTC credit had been
negotiated with the U.S. Army.
Pitzer strongly recommended that the
army limited credit plan be accepted by the
senate. On Jan. 22 the senate approved the
army proposal, but felt that a decision of
such importance should be voted upon by
all members of the faculty.
The results of a mail ballot distributed to
all faculty were announced March 30, with
the president and senate's approval upheld
by a narrow vote margin.
This action set the stage for the unor
ganized violence following Tom Hayden's
March 31 speech.
Seven nights of trashing on campus fol
lowed, with numerous police arrests.

rations and violence, Pitzer asked the Fa
