## Marriage dilemma: choosing mates 
### 
What would you do if you re
ceived word from your parents
that they had proudly arranged
for your marriage? Chances are
that you would not be ecstatic.
As a matter of fact, you would
probably hear the news in disbe
lief, and, when you finally ac
cepted the information as real
ity, you would consider this
privileged arrangement an un
acceptable infringement on your
rights. Unquestionably, you
would be right. Some rights are
relative to the epoch.
But consider, hypothetically,
that such an arranged marriage
were accepted practice. How
would it compare to the way we
arrange marriages now? What

would be the expectation of such
a marriage by the prospective
partners? How would the rela
tionship of the partners be com
pared to the relationships we see
today?
Obviously, today's marriages
are decided upon by free choice
of individuals involved, aren't
they?lnto that choice goes(usu
ally) that essential element of

love. But along with this impor
tant element, the partners in the
choice must decide that they are
ready to be married.
This decision is not limited to
being married to the specific in
dividual being considered, but
rather, the individual must de
cide whether he or she is ready to
take on the commitments, re
sponsibilities and lifestyle per
ceived as marriage.
Today, particularly, our per
ceptions of marriage are molded
very strongly by the media. Most
of us dream of the blissful and
calm relationships which we
were brought up on by Ozzie and
Harriet, Father Knows Best and
Leave it to Beaver.
Having seen marriages work
so easily on such programs, we
cannot help but feel that it can
work that way for us too: the
handsome and strong father

comes home happily after a full
day's work at his middle
management job and proceeds
unexhaustingly to offer sage and
accurate advice and comfort. In
the meantime, Mom gleefully is
cooking dinner, doing the wash,
transporting the kids, etc.
As a consequence of our per
ceptions of marriage, pieces of
which are taken discriminat
ingly from observation of our pa
rents' marriage, our friends' pa
rents'marriages and from media
marriages, we undoubtedly have
certain preconceptions about the
attributes of our potential mates.
These attributes are designed
around those characteristics
which we feel will best lend to
the fulfillment of the "dream"
marriage.
Among these characteristics
are some as mundane as height,
weight, hair color, skin tone,
fingernail length. Also among
these criteria may be characteris
tics as intangible as sensitivity,
energy level, moral structure
and general personality traits.
Moreover, the individual's
criteria for choosing a marital
partner are shaped by those in
escapable social roles of the po
tential mate. That is to say, social
status, upbringing and religion
are not unimportant to mate
choice (even for the most inno
cent).
But perhaps most important in
this day and age in deciding
upon a marital partner is sexual
ecstasy. Not only do the media
portray blissful interpersonal
and economic relationships,
they also instill in us the need for
constant electric passion.
Unfortunately, none of the
image creation of the media in
clude the goings on behind

doors. (Since the door to the bed
room is often left open.) Only
from soap operas do we see that
if passion and bliss in marriage
are not achieved, then just step
next door for passion and an un
derstanding and warm relation
ship. Or get a divorce and then
find passion.
But life just isn't that easy.
Mental and emotional relations
are not always blissful and calm;
physical relationships are not
always passionate and electric. If
one of these fantastic elements is
missing in marriage, you don't
always just give up on the rela
tionship.
In an arranged marriage, many
of these artificial preconceptions
of how marriage is or should be
have little meaning. The only
preconception of the marriage
would be that the partners were
compatible socially and beyond
that any relationship that would
even exist would take a lot of
work by both partners. Bliss,
passion, etc. would have to be
developed along with a trusting
relationship between the
partners who were placed to
gether as a consequence of many
external criteria determined by
their parents.
There would be little possibil
ity of deluding oneself about the
fantasies of an arranged mar
riage.
None of this is to raisea banner
calling for a resurge of parental
matchmaking. Merely, it is an
advocacy of reality. What is re
ally in store in marriage? What
are the real bases for choosing
marriage partners? Perhaps
even, do you want to be married
at all?

criteria for choosing a marital
partner are shaped by those in
escapable social roles of the po
tential mate. That is to say, social
status, upbringing and religion
are not unimportant to mate
choice (even for the most inno
cent).
But perhaps most important in
this day and age in deciding
upon a marital partner is sexual
ecstasy. Not only do the media
portray blissful interpersonal
and economic relationships,
they also instill in us the need for
constant electric passion.
Unfortunately, none of the
image creation of the media in
clude the goings on behind

doors. (Since the door to the bed
room is often left open.) Only
from soap operas do we see that
if passion and bliss in marriage
are not achieved, then just step
next door for passion and an un
derstanding and warm relation
ship. Or get a divorce and then
find passion.
But life just isn't that easy.
Mental and emotional relations
are not always blissful and calm;
physical relationships are not
always passionate and electric. If
one of these fantastic elements is
missing in marriage, you don't
always just give up on the rela
tionship.
In an arranged marriage, many
of these artificial preconceptions
of how marriage is or should be
have little meaning. The only
preconception of the marriage
would be that the partners were
compatible socially and beyond
that any relationship that would
even exist would take a lot of
work by both partners. Bliss,
passion, etc. would have to be
developed along with a trusting
relationship between the
partners who were placed to
gether as a consequence of many
external criteria determined by
their parents.
There would be little possibil
ity of deluding oneself about the
fantasies of an arranged mar
riage.
None of this is to raisea banner
calling for a resurge of parental
matchmaking. Merely, it is an
advocacy of reality. What is re
ally in store in marriage? What
are the real bases for choosing
marriage partners? Perhaps
even, do you want to be married
at all?

What would you do if you re
ceived word from your parents
that they had proudly arranged
for your marriage? Chances are
that you would not be ecstatic.
As a matter of fact, you would
probably hear the news in disbe
lief, and, when you finally ac
cepted the information as real
ity, you would consider this
privileged arrangement an un
acceptable infringement on your
rights. Unquestionably, you
would be right. Some rights are
relative to the epoch.
But consider, hypothetically,
that such an arranged marriage
were accepted practice. How
would it compare to the way we
arrange marriages now? What

would be the expectation of such
a marriage by the prospective
partners? How would the rela
tionship of the partners be com
pared to the relationships we see
today?
Obviously, today's marriages
are decided upon by free choice
of individuals involved, aren't
they?lnto that choice goes(usu
ally) that essential element of

love. But along with this impor
tant element, the partners in the
choice must decide that they are
ready to be married.
This decision is not limited to
being married to the specific in
dividual being considered, but
rather, the individual must de
cide whether he or she is ready to
take on the commitments, re
sponsibilities and lifestyle per
ceived as marriage.
Today, particularly, our per
ceptions of marriage are molded
very strongly by the media. Most
of us dream of the blissful and
calm relationships which we
were brought up on by Ozzie and
Harriet, Father Knows Best and
Leave it to Beaver.
Having seen marriages work
so easily on such programs, we
cannot help but feel that it can
work that way for us too: the
handsome and strong father

comes home happily after a full
day's work at his middle
management job and proceeds
unexhaustingly to offer sage and
accurate advice and comfort. In
the meantime, Mom gleefully is
cooking dinner, doing the wash,
transporting the kids, etc.
As a consequence of our per
ceptions of marriage, pieces of
which are taken discriminat
ingly from observation of our pa
rents' marriage, our friends' pa
rents'marriages and from media
marriages, we undoubtedly have
certain preconceptions about the
attributes of our potential mates.
These attributes are designed
around those characteristics
which we feel will best lend to
the fulfillment of the "dream"
marriage.
Among these characteristics
are some as mundane as height,
weight, hair color, skin tone,
fingernail length. Also among
these criteria may be characteris
tics as intangible as sensitivity,
energy level, moral structure
and general personality traits.
