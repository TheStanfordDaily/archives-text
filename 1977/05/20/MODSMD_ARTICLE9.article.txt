# Apartheid sit-in successful

Nelson el al.

The Committee Against Ra
cism (CAR) strongly supports
the May 9 sit-in at Old Union as
an initial step toward defeating
apartheid in South Africa. We
are taking this opportunity to as
sess the current situation at Stan
ford and to draw some lessons
from the recent experience.
At the outset it is important to
expose the statements by Presi
dent Lyman and the trustees that
their disagreement with the
anti-racist forces is entirely over
tactics and not over apartheid it
self. (This is exactly the same ar
gument that Nixon used
throughout his first term to de
scribe his differences with the
anti-war protestors, claiming
that he shared the protestors'
goal of peace in Vietnam. Ni
xon's commitment to peace ul
timately found expression in the
Christmas bombings of 1972.)
No one should be fooled by
these smokescreens. U.S. corpo
rations have made virtually no
progress toward eliminating
apartheid in South Africa. On
the contrary these corporations
play a critical role in supporting
the South African government,
e.g., IBM has computerized the
notorious pass system.
In any case, progressive in
volvement by corporations is se
verely limited by South African
law and policy, e.g., the forced
resettlement of blacks intheban
tustans.
Prior to the sit-in, various stu
dent organizations had attemp
ted to engage the trustees in ra
tional argument, and many stu
dents participated in a fast.
Since the trustees continue to
maintain their policy of abstain
ing, it is clear that the above ac
tivities have failed to change the
trustees' position. The trustees'
steadfastness should not be sur
prising in view of Lyman's
statement shortly before the ar
rests began: "There has not been
a single trustee at either meeting
who has given the slightest indi
cation they wished to vote for the
(Ford) proxy resolution (Daily,
May 10)."
Futile attempts
Having seen that attempts to
engage the hearts and minds of
the trustees are futile, we must
ask ourselves why this is so.
Firstly, the trustees who control
the university are the same indi
viduals who control direct in
vestment in South Africa, e.g.
Trustee John Grey is the presi
dent of Standard Oil of Califor
nia, an apartheid profiteer which
fuels the economy of South Af
rica. Secondly, the trustees feel

pressure from wealthy alumni,
especially alumni who donate
large blocks of stock. Thirdly,
the trustees have once again de
termined that they are the ones
who will control university in
vestment policy.
Thus we can see that the trus
tees are not going to change their
position on South Africa unless
they are forced to do so. In par
ticular, it is a mistake to argue
that we can relax our struggle in
the hope that the trustees will
change their position next year.
So far we have achieved a de
monstration of militance here
which has played a decisive role
in developing consciousness
both here and elsewhere. But we
have not won anything since the
granting of the weakest de
mands, a cost-benefit study on
divestment and a meeting with
the trustees will do nothing to
defeat apartheid. CAR has con
sistently opposed such weak
demands as diverting attention
from the main demand on the
Ford proxy. And now Lyman
and the trustees are representing
the granting of the weakest de
mands as evidence of "com
promise."
The only meaningful de
mands are those which can have
a direct effect in defeating apar
theid. CAR says we should de
mand: (1) Yes on all
withdrawal/nonexpansion pro
xies; (2) If the proxies fail to pass,
divestment of all companies en
gaged in South Africa; (3) Ban all
firms engaged in South Africa
from recruiting at the Placement
Center.
Some people have argued that
the sit-in defendants should
plead guilty and take their
punishment in the classic tradi
tion of civil disobedience. This
is clearly what the administra
tion wants.
Submitting to punishment
may assuage individual guilt,
but it is not the most effective
way to fight apartheid. The
struggle over proxies should not
be seen as an attempt to purify
the University, but as a step in
the struggle to end apartheid in
South Africa.
No crime
The entire community must
now support the sit-in defen
dants as militantly as necessary.
Sitting in against apartheid
shouldn't be a crime and is
treated as one only in a racist
society. CAR says, no crime, no
prosecutions, no convictions.
All of us, except the apartheid
profiteers, have a genuine in
terest in fighting racism in

South Africa.
Although minorities suffer
most, racism hurts everyone
with progressive interests be
cause of its divisive effects. The
success of the sit-in shows the
power of a multiracial move
ment when racial divisions have
been overcome.
The people who sat in and
those who support them have
taken a major step in the fight
against racism. We must con-

tinue the fight against racism
through militant struggle on this
campus on South Africa and on
other issues. If you agree with us,
join us.
