# Frenzied students pay homage to cartoonist Trudeau
## 
### Mark Funk 
The Band played "All Right Now," whip
ping the packed Dinkelspiel Auditorium
into a frenzy. They stomped. They shouted.
They had gathered to pay homage to a hero.
Somewhere offstage was Garry Trudeau
who at age 28 has created a comic strip
which captures for many the absurdities
and frustrations of the contemporary world.
As he stepped out on stage he must have
been like he was walking into a panel from
Doonesbury.
If only Jeb Magruder had strolled to center
stage, picked up the mike and screamed:
"Lemme hear ya say YAAAAAAA!"
And they got a pretty good show. Trudeau
was both witty and urbane, articulate and in
tune with his audience.
Only once, near the end of his talk, did
Trudeau say anthing remotely philosophi
cal. He decried the tendency of commen
tators and other observers of the campus
scene to lump all students into one
homogeneous lump.
"If one group exists," he said, "the exis
tence of its opposite is equally assured."
Plied crowd
But for the most part, Trudeau plied his
crowd with humor. He started off by com
memorating a speech given here by Teddy

Roosevelt 50 years ago on the Panama
Canal—"a Bicentennial leftover" —in
which the 26th president said: "I took it."
Then he regaled the audience of the Car
los McClatchy Memorial Speech with tales
of his days as a freshman dorm adviser at
Yale, when 2D per cent of his wards quit
school during the first semester. One of his
charges was "a methadone magnet who had
taken to cutting his product with Nestle's
Quick."
But the creator of Doonesbury—of Mike,
Joanie Caucus, Zonker, Duke and Jimmy
Thudpucker—never said a word about the
comic strip which propelled him to virtual
cult status.
The Trudeau who tossed off one-liners
and sounded suspiciously like acerbic col
umnist Nicholas Von Hoffman yesterday
was a markedly different character from the
quieter, more introspective man who spoke
to a small gathering of Professional Jour
nalism Fellows (PJFs) earlier in the after
noon.
Varied subjects
Unlike his speech he answered questions.
He ranged broadly over subjects as varied as
Watergate and what the future holds in store
for Garry Trudeau. But the discussion al
ways revolved around their relation to the

comic strip and Hi'' development of its
characters.
Anybody who reads the comic pages
knows that Joanie Caucus graduated from
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Law School this
weekend. Trudeau spoke to Boalt's graduat
ing class Saturday He -.aid he had once
attempted to develop a character similar to
Joanie —Nicole —early in his career, but it
did not work out. Only alter he met a person
with Joanie Caucus-like qualities was he
able to understand her problems and create
a character.
Russian novel
Trudeau estimated th.it there were maybe
35 central characters in Doonesbury; "kind
of like an expanded Russian novel," but that
none of them were the cartoonist incar
nate,not even Mike. N . et lie admitted that, if
he had it to choose, "I would like to be like
Zonker."
He was, in fact, quite upen with the PJFs,
all of whom are hereon sabbatical from var
ious news-gathering organizations. They
wanted to know what his future holds in
store. "It is interesting that should ask,"
Trudeau replied, "because what 1 want to do
is what you're doing right now."
Trudeau is currently putting finishing
touches to an animated version of Doones

bury which will be telecast "sometime
around mid-October" —production
schedules and networks willing. He has
been working on the script for about two
years, first for ABC, whose affiliate stations
rejected the idea, and then NBC.
Do themselves
"All the political figures were going to do
themselves," Trudeau said. Walter Cron
kite, Ron Nessen an other luminaries had
agreed to provide their voices for the pro
duction. But since NBC took over, this has
changed.
Trudeau delves frequently into political
commentary. It earned him a Pulitzer Prize,
but it had an unexpected side effect: many
editors started putting Doonesbury on the
editorial page.
"As far as readership goes it's the worst
place to be," Trudeau said, noting that more
people buy newspapers for the comics than
the editorials.
After the seminar Trudeau dined with the
PJFs and "high officials" of the University.
It was ironic that the man who titillated
many a collegiate with his characterization
of the groveling, alumni-hating college pres
ident would share the same table with, yes,
Richard Lyman.

"All the political figures were going to do
themselves," Trudeau said. Walter Cron
kite, Ron Nessen an other luminaries had
agreed to provide their voices for the pro
duction. But since NBC took over, this has
changed.
Trudeau delves frequently into political
commentary. It earned him a Pulitzer Prize,
but it had an unexpected side effect: many
editors started putting Doonesbury on the
editorial page.
"As far as readership goes it's the worst
place to be," Trudeau said, noting that more
people buy newspapers for the comics than
the editorials.
After the seminar Trudeau dined with the
PJFs and "high officials" of the University.
It was ironic that the man who titillated
many a collegiate with his characterization
of the groveling, alumni-hating college pres
ident would share the same table with, yes,
Richard Lyman.


Garry Trudeau
The Band played "All Right Now," whip
ping the packed Dinkelspiel Auditorium
into a frenzy. They stomped. They shouted.
They had gathered to pay homage to a hero.
Somewhere offstage was Garry Trudeau
who at age 28 has created a comic strip
which captures for many the absurdities
and frustrations of the contemporary world.
As he stepped out on stage he must have
been like he was walking into a panel from
Doonesbury.
If only Jeb Magruder had strolled to center
stage, picked up the mike and screamed:
"Lemme hear ya say YAAAAAAA!"
And they got a pretty good show. Trudeau
was both witty and urbane, articulate and in
tune with his audience.
Only once, near the end of his talk, did
Trudeau say anthing remotely philosophi
cal. He decried the tendency of commen
tators and other observers of the campus
scene to lump all students into one
homogeneous lump.
"If one group exists," he said, "the exis
tence of its opposite is equally assured."
Plied crowd
But for the most part, Trudeau plied his
crowd with humor. He started off by com
memorating a speech given here by Teddy

Roosevelt 50 years ago on the Panama
Canal—"a Bicentennial leftover" —in
which the 26th president said: "I took it."
Then he regaled the audience of the Car
los McClatchy Memorial Speech with tales
of his days as a freshman dorm adviser at
Yale, when 2D per cent of his wards quit
school during the first semester. One of his
charges was "a methadone magnet who had
taken to cutting his product with Nestle's
Quick."
But the creator of Doonesbury—of Mike,
Joanie Caucus, Zonker, Duke and Jimmy
Thudpucker—never said a word about the
comic strip which propelled him to virtual
cult status.
The Trudeau who tossed off one-liners
and sounded suspiciously like acerbic col
umnist Nicholas Von Hoffman yesterday
was a markedly different character from the
quieter, more introspective man who spoke
to a small gathering of Professional Jour
nalism Fellows (PJFs) earlier in the after
noon.
Varied subjects
Unlike his speech he answered questions.
He ranged broadly over subjects as varied as
Watergate and what the future holds in store
for Garry Trudeau. But the discussion al
ways revolved around their relation to the

comic strip and Hi'' development of its
characters.
Anybody who reads the comic pages
knows that Joanie Caucus graduated from
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Law School this
weekend. Trudeau spoke to Boalt's graduat
ing class Saturday He -.aid he had once
attempted to develop a character similar to
Joanie —Nicole —early in his career, but it
did not work out. Only alter he met a person
with Joanie Caucus-like qualities was he
able to understand her problems and create
a character.
Russian novel
Trudeau estimated th.it there were maybe
35 central characters in Doonesbury; "kind
of like an expanded Russian novel," but that
none of them were the cartoonist incar
nate,not even Mike. N . et lie admitted that, if
he had it to choose, "I would like to be like
Zonker."
He was, in fact, quite upen with the PJFs,
all of whom are hereon sabbatical from var
ious news-gathering organizations. They
wanted to know what his future holds in
store. "It is interesting that should ask,"
Trudeau replied, "because what 1 want to do
is what you're doing right now."
Trudeau is currently putting finishing
touches to an animated version of Doones

bury which will be telecast "sometime
around mid-October" —production
schedules and networks willing. He has
been working on the script for about two
years, first for ABC, whose affiliate stations
rejected the idea, and then NBC.
