# Professor responds on grading question

William Bonner

In view of Provost William Miller's disclo
sure (Daily, May 17) that I have chosen not to
appeal his decision to change Peter Cohen's
grade from B to A- in a chemistry course, it now
becomes necessary for me to explain publicly
both my unwillingness to change Cohen's
grade as well as my reluctance to appeal Mil
ler's decision. I can do so no more concisely
than to quote verbatim my May 2 letter to Miller
on these matters:
Dear Dr. Miller,
"Please let me emphasize again something I
have stated verbally and in writing on numer
ous occasions in the past: Mr. Peter Cohen's
grade of B in Chemistry 33 in Winter Quarter,
1976 was based solely on his overall academic
performance as compared to that of the rest of
his class — fairly applying to his case criteria
and practices which I and many of my de
partmental colleagues routinely use and have
used in the past.
"There is no academic justification what
soever for raising Mr. Cohen's grade, and for
this reason I am unwilling to do so. His perfor
mance was simply not of A calibre. Your jus
tification for your decision to raise Mr. Cohen's
grade administratively to A- is, as you have
stated it, based on the hypothetical, contrary
to-fact consideration that if Mr. Cohen had
"quit while he was ahead" he would have got

ten an A-.
"You know, I know, and I hope Mr. Cohen
knows that your administrative action — while
its effect may appear on his record — does not
necessarily make Mr. Cohen an A student in the
eyes of the academic community. In this con
nection, and in fairness to the other students in
his class, I would like to request that along with
the grade change which you institute on Mr.
Cohen's transcript a notation be added that this
grade was administratively awarded and does
not reflect the evaluation of his instructor.
"I personally believe that your action on this
matter is both ill-advised and wrong, and that it
has most unfortunate implications for the fu
ture integrity of the grading system at Stanford.
However, since I see little likelihood that the
administration might reverse itself and apply
academic performance as opposed to narrowly
legalistic criteria in any future revaluation of
Mr. Cohen's case, I believe it would be a waste
of my time to pursue the matter any further."
The reason I have "fought" this trivial grade
change for some 13 months is simple. I believe
it is a dangerous infringement on academic in
tegrity — both at Stanford and elsewhere — if
administrators (under whatever student pres
sure), as opposed to faculty, have the ultimate
say-so as to the grade a student should receive.

In view of Provost William Miller's disclo
sure (Daily, May 17) that I have chosen not to
appeal his decision to change Peter Cohen's
grade from B to A- in a chemistry course, it now
becomes necessary for me to explain publicly
both my unwillingness to change Cohen's
grade as well as my reluctance to appeal Mil
ler's decision. I can do so no more concisely
than to quote verbatim my May 2 letter to Miller
on these matters:
Dear Dr. Miller,
"Please let me emphasize again something I
have stated verbally and in writing on numer
ous occasions in the past: Mr. Peter Cohen's
grade of B in Chemistry 33 in Winter Quarter,
1976 was based solely on his overall academic
performance as compared to that of the rest of
his class — fairly applying to his case criteria
and practices which I and many of my de
partmental colleagues routinely use and have
used in the past.
"There is no academic justification what
soever for raising Mr. Cohen's grade, and for
this reason I am unwilling to do so. His perfor
mance was simply not of A calibre. Your jus
tification for your decision to raise Mr. Cohen's
grade administratively to A- is, as you have
stated it, based on the hypothetical, contrary
to-fact consideration that if Mr. Cohen had
"quit while he was ahead" he would have got

ten an A-.
"You know, I know, and I hope Mr. Cohen
knows that your administrative action — while
its effect may appear on his record — does not
necessarily make Mr. Cohen an A student in the
eyes of the academic community. In this con
nection, and in fairness to the other students in
his class, I would like to request that along with
the grade change which you institute on Mr.
Cohen's transcript a notation be added that this
grade was administratively awarded and does
not reflect the evaluation of his instructor.
"I personally believe that your action on this
matter is both ill-advised and wrong, and that it
has most unfortunate implications for the fu
ture integrity of the grading system at Stanford.
However, since I see little likelihood that the
administration might reverse itself and apply
academic performance as opposed to narrowly
legalistic criteria in any future revaluation of
Mr. Cohen's case, I believe it would be a waste
of my time to pursue the matter any further."
The reason I have "fought" this trivial grade
change for some 13 months is simple. I believe
it is a dangerous infringement on academic in
tegrity — both at Stanford and elsewhere — if
administrators (under whatever student pres
sure), as opposed to faculty, have the ultimate
say-so as to the grade a student should receive.
