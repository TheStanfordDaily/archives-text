## Letter to the editor Gibson errs on mortality rates 
### 
Better death rates
The letter by my colleague
Count D. Gibson, Jr. (Daily, May
18), carries in its fourth parag
raph the following incorrect
statement: "Despite the massive
expenditures in the U,.S.
'pluralistic'system, there is not a
single measure of health status
in which we show an improve
ment over the English."
A quick look at the U.S. final
mortality statistics for 1975 re
ported in Monthly Vital Statis
tics Report (Vol. 25, No. 11, Sup
plement, Feb. 11, 1977) should

prove to be an eye-opener to
those persons who for several
years have perpetrated the myth
that mortality figures of the Un
ited States are poorer than those
of the United Kingdom (U.K.).
For example, whereas the
1975 death rate per 1000 popula
tion of males in the United
Kingdom was 12.3, in theUnited
States it was 10.1 In 1970,
whereas the death rate for males
was again 12.3 per 1000 in the
United Kingdom, it was 10.9 in
the United States. In 1960, the
U.K. rate was 12.1 per 1000

while the U.S. rate was 11.0
Thus, while in the U.K. over
the last 15 years the male mortal
ity rate has slightly worsened, in
the U.S. the male mortality rate
has improved.
Also in the U.K., death rates of
females per 1000 were 11.4 in
1975, but in the U.S per 1000
only 7.7. In 1960, the U.K. rate
was 10.9, as compared to a U.S.
rate of 8.1.
Even when one looks at the
data breakdown between whites
and "all other," the U.S. has a
better death rate record. In 1975,
the death rate in the U.S. for "all
other, male" was 10.0 against the
U.K. rate of 12.3 for all male in
the U.K. In 1965, the death rate
per 1000 of other than white
males was 11.1 in the U.S. as
compared to 12.2 for all males in
the U.K.
Life expectancy figures in the
U.S. again show very favorable
outcomes as compared to those
of the U.K. At birth, in 1975
females in the U.S. had 76.4-76.5
years, depending on source of fi
gures, as compared to 75.1 years
in the U.K. in 1971-73 (latest av
ailable data). Males, however, in
the U.S. have at birth only 68.5-
68.7 yers of life expectancy as
compared to 68.8 years in the
U.K.
However, if one compares life
expectancy at age 65 which is far
more meaningful in evaluating
medical care outcomes, then one
finds that U.S. males have a life
expectancy of 13.7 years in com
parison to 12.1 years for the U.K.
males, and U.S. females have a

life expectancy of 17.9 years as
compared to 16 years for U.K.
females.
Out-of-date infant mortality
data have inaccurately been
used over the years to compare
U.S. experience with that of the
U.K. In 1975, deaths of infants
under one year of age per 1000
were 16.1 in the U.S. and 16.0 in
the U.K. Among white infants in
the U.S. the mortality rate was
14.2 per 1000 in 1975.
However, for "all other" in
fants it was 24.2 per 1000, consid
erably higher than the 16.0 rate
of the United Kingdom. How
ever, it is interesting that for
Northern Ireland the infant mor
tality rate is 20.4 per 1000.
In 1960, deaths of infants
under one year in the U.S. were
27 per 1000, much higher than in
the U.K., where the rate was 22.4
per 1000. The substantial im
provement in the U.S. infant
mortality figures I believe can be
attributed at least as much to the
liberalization of the abortion
laws as to better medical care.
As an economist, I do not be
lieve that there is a direct rela
tionship between medical care
input and health outcomes.
However, it is my colleague Gib
son who suggests in his letter
that there is. The above data,
therefore, which show a greater
improvement in the usual mor
tality measures for the U.S. than
those for the U.K, should prove
to be of interest.
