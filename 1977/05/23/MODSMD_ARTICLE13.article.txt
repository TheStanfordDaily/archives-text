# Chantilly offers Haute Cuisine

One of the finest restaur
ants serving haute cuisine
is also extremely close to
campus. Before it was taken
over by two experienced re
stauranteurs, it used to be
Frere Jacques.

Chantilly is that type of re

staurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gance of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive at
mosphere, without the pre
tension of other top-flight re
staurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile
and the diverse menu shows
imagination: sauteed veal
and eggplant ($8.75), L'es
calopine de Veau a la Bolog
naise for two ($l9), Chicken
Cynthia ($7.25) with cham
pagne, grapes and orange,
Melanzana a la Feta ($5.25 —
for two).
k Chantilly is proud of the

kouse wines from Parducci
(the Chablis placed first in the
recent jug tasting on campus).
The admirable wine list has
many French vintages and
fine special selections from
California.
Soupe a l'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best
sampled of all the restaurants.
It wasn't swamped with
cheese. And the onions and
bread were firm rather than
mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces
and refined seasonings en
hance rather than stifle the

freshness of Chantilly's dis
hes. The Liaison Salad a la
Chantilly for two ($5.50) with
lettuce, cucumber, olive, ba
con, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Medallions of Spring
Lamb ($8.50) sauteed with
fresh tarragon, will both de
light rather than assault your
palate.
There is a long dessert list,
but as strawberries are in sea
son, request fraises Chantilly
(not on the menu). It's a light
ending to an excellent meal.
Chantilly is located in
downtown Halo Alto and 1
highly recommend it.
