## Stanford seeded No. 3 in team tourney Netters in NCAA opener today 
### Jill Lieber 
Stanford's tennis team faces
Utah today in the opening round
of the NCAA championships in
Atlanta, Ga.
The Cards are the tourna
ment's third seed in the first year
of true NCAA team competition.
The nation's top 16 net squads
will play a six-singles, three
doubles team format today
through Wednesday, with the
winning teams advancing as a
unit.
After the team championship
is finished May 25, the 64 indi
viduals and 32 doubles teams
that posted the best 1977 college
records will compete in a regular
tournament draw, with the
championship matches set for
Memorial Day, May 30.
Mitchell has top spot
Stanford sophomore All-
American Matt Mitchell is
seeded first in both singles and
doubles with teammate Perry
Wright.
Stanford is the only school
with three players seeded in the
top 15 of the individual tourney.
In addition to Mitchell, Bill
Maze, a junior Ail-American is
seeded No. 4 and junior Wright,
No. 14. Maze and sophomore
John Rast were also granted
entry in the doubles draw.
"What we're most concerned
with is the team tournament,"
said coach Dick Gould. "UCLA
is the top seed and an over
whelming favorite, and it'll be
up to the other teams to beat
them."
UCLA tough to beat
In the seedings, UCLA is fol
lowed by Trinity, Stanford and
Southern Methodist University.
Other teams involved are USC,
Yale, Texas, Michigan, Utah,
California, Georgia, Princeton,
Texas Christian University,

Miami, North Carolina and Ok
lahoma.
The Cards' lineup includes
Mitchell, Maze, Wright,
freshman Jim Hodges at the No. 4
spot, Rast, and freshman Lloyd
Bourne. Mitchell-Wright,
Maze-Rast and Hodges and Peter
Rennert will be the doubles duos
for the Cards.
Cards have good chance
"First of all, the six-singles,
three-doubles format allows
team members who've played all
year to compete in the NCAA,"
Gould said. "Also, it takes out
the 'luck of the draw' element.
The players who will be in
volved in the singles and dou
bles tournament will have only

the individual title at stake,
without having to worry about
team pressure. And the new
format eliminates the possibility
of one player or an outstanding
doubles entry leading a team to a
title. Depth will be the factor in
the team tournament."
Up against Bruins?
If the Cards can get past Utah
today, they will most likely face
Georgia in the quarterfinals.
Providing both UCLA and Stan
ford win their first two matches,
the two powerhouses will meet
tomorrow afternoon with the
winner moving into Wednes
day's finals.
And speaking of finals, many
of the Cards have already taken

their finals since they will be
missing school all this week.
"I haven't had much time to
think about tennis with so much
going on at school," said
freshman Bourne, going into his
first NCAA competition. "But
once 1 get on the plane, I'll real ly
start cooking."

that posted the best 1977 college
records will compete in a regular
tournament draw, with the
championship matches set for
Memorial Day, May 30.
Mitchell has top spot
Stanford sophomore All-
American Matt Mitchell is
seeded first in both singles and
doubles with teammate Perry
Wright.
Stanford is the only school
with three players seeded in the
top 15 of the individual tourney.
In addition to Mitchell, Bill
Maze, a junior Ail-American is
seeded No. 4 and junior Wright,
No. 14. Maze and sophomore
John Rast were also granted
entry in the doubles draw.
"What we're most concerned
with is the team tournament,"
said coach Dick Gould. "UCLA
is the top seed and an over
whelming favorite, and it'll be
up to the other teams to beat
them."
UCLA tough to beat
In the seedings, UCLA is fol
lowed by Trinity, Stanford and
Southern Methodist University.
Other teams involved are USC,
Yale, Texas, Michigan, Utah,
California, Georgia, Princeton,
Texas Christian University,

Miami, North Carolina and Ok
lahoma.
The Cards' lineup includes
Mitchell, Maze, Wright,
freshman Jim Hodges at the No. 4
spot, Rast, and freshman Lloyd
Bourne. Mitchell-Wright,
Maze-Rast and Hodges and Peter
Rennert will be the doubles duos
for the Cards.
Cards have good chance
"First of all, the six-singles,
three-doubles format allows
team members who've played all
year to compete in the NCAA,"
Gould said. "Also, it takes out
the 'luck of the draw' element.
The players who will be in
volved in the singles and dou
bles tournament will have only

the individual title at stake,
without having to worry about
team pressure. And the new
format eliminates the possibility
of one player or an outstanding
doubles entry leading a team to a
title. Depth will be the factor in
the team tournament."
Up against Bruins?
If the Cards can get past Utah
today, they will most likely face
Georgia in the quarterfinals.
Providing both UCLA and Stan
ford win their first two matches,
the two powerhouses will meet
tomorrow afternoon with the
winner moving into Wednes
day's finals.
And speaking of finals, many
of the Cards have already taken

their finals since they will be
missing school all this week.
"I haven't had much time to
think about tennis with so much
going on at school," said
freshman Bourne, going into his
first NCAA competition. "But
once 1 get on the plane, I'll real ly
start cooking."
