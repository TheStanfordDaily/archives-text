# 'Defeats '76 Olympic gold medalist
## Lofton stars in Modesto 
### Bruce Anderson 
James Lofton beat 1976 Olympic gold
medalist Arnie Robinson on his last leap — a
26-7 effort — to capture the long jump at the
California Relays Saturday in Modesto.
A 26-3 leap by the Stanford junior led the
competition until Robinson jumped 26-6 on his
next-to-last jump. Lofton came right back and
set a meet record to win the event on his last
jump.
"Arnie came over before my last jump and
said, 'Relax. Don't overtry. Just jump natural
and you'll win,' " Lofton said.
Good counsel
Heeding the advice of the man who has been
the No. 1 jumper in the world for several years,
Lofton soared to his second best jump ever.
Last year Lofton went to Modesto looking for
his first 25-foot jump of the season to qualify for
the NCAA finals and the U.S. Olympic Trials.
He got his 25-foot leap and went on to place
third in the NCAA meet and fifth at the Olympic
Trials.
Lofton's rapid blossoming as a world-class
long jumper has been such that he has surpas
sed 25 feet in every meet this season and 26 feet
in five meets.
The 6-foot-3 jumper from Los Angeles began
the season by defeating Robinson in January at
the San Francisco Examiner Indoor Meet. He
has since copped the West Coast Relay, Na
tional University of Mexico Invitational, Stan
ford Invitational and Pacific-8 long jump titles.
The two most important titles of the season,

however, are still to be won — the NCAA and
the AAU.
The NCAA meet pits the Cardinal star against
Illinois' Charlton Ehizuelen, who beat Lofton
for the NCAA indoor crown, and Larry Doubley,
USC's 6-foot-7 freshman gazelle.
Ehizuelen, winner of the 1975 NCAA long
jump title, will be jumping in his home pit for
the NCAA meet as the 11 lini host this year's
championships. Ehizuelen's 26-7V2 jump ear
lier in the season is the second best mark in the
world this year, Lofton's 26-9 leap in Mexico
City being the best.
Jordan honored
Meet officials dedicated this year's meet to
four-time Olympic hurdler Willie Davenport
and Stanford track coach Payton Jordan. Both
surprised and pleased with the honor, Jordan
responded by setting an age group (over-60)
world record of 11.1 for 100 yards, shattering
his own mark of 11.5.
The veteran track coach expressed satisfac
tion with his sprint effort as well as the efforts of
the Cardinal sprint relay. The 400-meter four
some of Marvin Holmes, Lofton, Gordon Banks
and Alan Sheats clocked a 40.19 lap. Jordan
said the relay showing "put us right on target
for the NCAA meet."
The NCAA finals begin June 1 and run for
four days. The Cardinals will send Lofton in the
long jump, Terry Albritton, shot put; Steve
Crowley, 1500 meters; Sheats, 400 meters; Tom
Shellworth, 400 intermediate hurdles, and
Holmes, Lofton, Banks and Sheats in the 400-
meter relay.
