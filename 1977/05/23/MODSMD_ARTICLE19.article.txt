# Swim coach Meyer quits, takes job with Speedo
## 
### Jill Lieber 
Debbie Meyer has announced her resignation as
assistant swim coach for Stanford. The 24-year old
Meyer will take a promoting job with Speedo, Inc.,
the world's largest manufacturer of swim pro
ducts.
The job is a big increase in salary and involves
traveling to most all of the top national and inter
national swim meets.
"She just had a good opportunity," said head
swim coach Jim Gaughran. "She had a tough time
making the decision to leave Stanford."
"I am sad," said sophomore All-American Scott
O'Connor. "I don't know what it'll do to the prog
ram. Debbie acted as a buffer zone — a liason.
When anyone had a complaint they went to Debbie
first and then to Jim."
"I am really sad and disappointed she's leaving,'
said Jo Harshbarger, a sophomore Olympian and
women's scholarship recipient.
"Debbie created a closer coach-swimmer rela
tionship which the team was really lacking before
she came," Harshbarger added.
Meyer, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in
the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, was recently
voted the third greatest swimmer ever and was
inducted into the 1977 Swimming Hall of Fame in
April.
Meyer was the first woman to hold five world

records at one time and the first swimmer ever —
male or female — to win three individual gold
medals.
She and 17 year-coach Gaughran worked side
by-side with both the men's and women's teams
last season.
"I have a lot of respect for Jim," Meyer said
earlier in the season. "It made me feel good to hear
someone say a while ago that over all the years
with other assistant coaches, Jim took control and
he wanted it done his way. But he has let me do so
much."
"A lot of people credit Debbie as the one who
added the extra yards in workout this season," said
junior All-American Jack Connelly. "But both De
bbie and Jim worked together. She helped mainly
because we had an extra person there who knew
what was going on."
This year the Cards increased their yardage to
15,000 yards in two workouts six days a week.
Prior to this season, training was approximately
7000 yards tops.
Meyer helped coach the women's team to sec
ond at the AIAW nationals and the men's to
seventh in the NCAAs.
"Debbie got a really good job offer," Harshbarger
said. "We've got to realize that by saying we want
her to stay, we are being selfish. Her opportunity is
a lifetime thing. It's different from the three or four
years we'd be coached by her."

making the decision to leave Stanford."
"I am sad," said sophomore All-American Scott
O'Connor. "I don't know what it'll do to the prog
ram. Debbie acted as a buffer zone — a liason.
When anyone had a complaint they went to Debbie
first and then to Jim."
"I am really sad and disappointed she's leaving,'
said Jo Harshbarger, a sophomore Olympian and
women's scholarship recipient.
"Debbie created a closer coach-swimmer rela
tionship which the team was really lacking before
she came," Harshbarger added.
Meyer, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in
the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, was recently
voted the third greatest swimmer ever and was
inducted into the 1977 Swimming Hall of Fame in
April.
Meyer was the first woman to hold five world

records at one time and the first swimmer ever —
male or female — to win three individual gold
medals.
She and 17 year-coach Gaughran worked side
by-side with both the men's and women's teams
last season.
"I have a lot of respect for Jim," Meyer said
earlier in the season. "It made me feel good to hear
someone say a while ago that over all the years
with other assistant coaches, Jim took control and
he wanted it done his way. But he has let me do so
much."
"A lot of people credit Debbie as the one who
added the extra yards in workout this season," said
junior All-American Jack Connelly. "But both De
bbie and Jim worked together. She helped mainly
because we had an extra person there who knew
what was going on."
This year the Cards increased their yardage to
15,000 yards in two workouts six days a week.
Prior to this season, training was approximately
7000 yards tops.
Meyer helped coach the women's team to sec
ond at the AIAW nationals and the men's to
seventh in the NCAAs.
"Debbie got a really good job offer," Harshbarger
said. "We've got to realize that by saying we want
her to stay, we are being selfish. Her opportunity is
a lifetime thing. It's different from the three or four
years we'd be coached by her."


Assistant swim coach Debbie Meyer announced her resignation Friday. Meyer, who helped coach
the women's team to second place and the men's team to seventh in the Nationals, will be taking
on a job with Speedo, Inc.
Debbie Meyer has announced her resignation as
assistant swim coach for Stanford. The 24-year old
Meyer will take a promoting job with Speedo, Inc.,
the world's largest manufacturer of swim pro
ducts.
The job is a big increase in salary and involves
traveling to most all of the top national and inter
national swim meets.
"She just had a good opportunity," said head
swim coach Jim Gaughran. "She had a tough time
making the decision to leave Stanford."
"I am sad," said sophomore All-American Scott
O'Connor. "I don't know what it'll do to the prog
