News organizations are "playing
Clod" if they suppress stories because
of their possible consequences, CBS
News President Richard Salant de
clared here Friday when questioned
about news coverage of terrorist ac
tivities.
Salant spoke at a question and ans
wer session in kresge Auditorium
sponsored by the Professional Jour
nalism Fellowship Program.
"We just reject the notion that be
cause...publicity about a terrorist
event will give somebody else an
idea..., we shouldn't report it," Salant
said. He called such suppression
"dangerous."
He added, however, that news or
ganizations should use discretion in
reporting such events. Guidelines
have been set up by CBS and other
news gathering groups for reporting of
i ncidents such as the takeover of three
buildings in Washington. D.C. by Ha
nafi Moslem terrorists recently.
Live interviews
He said reporting on CBS would be
designed to make the incident "no
more sensational than it is." Live in
terviews with terrorists would not be
aired, reporters will cooperate with au
thorities and telephone contact with
terrorists will be restricted to that ap
proved by police among other actions.
He said those guidelines were de
veloped in cooperation with law en
forcement authorities in an effort to
prevent communications tieups and
other media interference with police
In addition, Salant said many
guidelines will make it tougher for ter
rorist groups to use the media as a free
platform for issuance of rhetoric.
Nonetheless, he stressed that "sup
pression is almost never justified." cal
ling it dangerous for word-of-mouth
rumors to take hold.
