# Salant calls suppression 'dangerous'
## 
### Mike Charison 
News organizations are "playing
Clod" if they suppress stories because
of their possible consequences, CBS
News President Richard Salant de
clared here Friday when questioned
about news coverage of terrorist ac
tivities.
Salant spoke at a question and ans
wer session in kresge Auditorium
sponsored by the Professional Jour
nalism Fellowship Program.
"We just reject the notion that be
cause...publicity about a terrorist
event will give somebody else an
idea..., we shouldn't report it," Salant
said. He called such suppression
"dangerous."
He added, however, that news or
ganizations should use discretion in
reporting such events. Guidelines
have been set up by CBS and other
news gathering groups for reporting of
i ncidents such as the takeover of three
buildings in Washington. D.C. by Ha
nafi Moslem terrorists recently.
Live interviews
He said reporting on CBS would be
designed to make the incident "no
more sensational than it is." Live in
terviews with terrorists would not be
aired, reporters will cooperate with au
thorities and telephone contact with
terrorists will be restricted to that ap
proved by police among other actions.
He said those guidelines were de
veloped in cooperation with law en
forcement authorities in an effort to
prevent communications tieups and
other media interference with police
In addition, Salant said many
guidelines will make it tougher for ter
rorist groups to use the media as a free
platform for issuance of rhetoric.
Nonetheless, he stressed that "sup
pression is almost never justified." cal
ling it dangerous for word-of-mouth
rumors to take hold.

something going on, then don't see it
on the news or in the papers, they start
to wonder 'what else aren't they re
porting?'" Salant said.
Salant also commented on former
CBS News correspondent Daniel
Schorr's involvement in publication of
a secret House committee report about
the CIA.
Salant said Schorr got a copy of the
report before the House decided to
suppress it. He reported about it on
CBS television and radio before giving
it to the Village Voice for publication.
After the report was published,
Schorr was asked to reveal his sources
and refused to, thereby facing a con
tempt citation from the House. Salant
said CBS paid for Schorr's defense, but
suspended the reporter during the in
quiry because "he was news."
Following House hearings, how
ever, Schorr told Salant he did not
wish to return to CBS, Salant recalled.
He said he had declined to use
"checkbook journalism" to obtain
David Frost's interviews of former
President Richard Nixon. The first two
interviews were "two of the most fas
cinating broadcasts ever," Salant said,
but "it's a question of principle."

Salant has been widely criticized for
paying former Nixon Chief of Staff
H.R. Haldeman $50,000 for an inter
view in 1975, a case which he called a
"mistake,"
"I didn't want to make the same mis
take twice," Salant said. "1 wish we
had been able to see our way clear to
have the interviews on CBS, (but) 1 take
great exception to paying anybody for
being interviewed in hard news, cur
rent news, situations."
After the session, Salent said he was
unclear whether television has re
sulted in a less informed public. "We
oversimplify," he remarked, saying 23
minutes per night to present all the
news puts heavy constraints on jour
nalists.
Time constraints "tend to make
things black and white. But all the
things we have to deal with to
day...have shades of gray."
But he said he couldn't say whether
the public is less informed. "I suspect
people who rely on television as their
sole source of news probably never
read newspapers and never will," he
said. Television news "may be better
than nothing, unless a little know
ledge is a dangerous thing. Then it's a
worse than nothing."

After the report was published,
Schorr was asked to reveal his sources
and refused to, thereby facing a con
tempt citation from the House. Salant
said CBS paid for Schorr's defense, but
suspended the reporter during the in
quiry because "he was news."
Following House hearings, how
ever, Schorr told Salant he did not
wish to return to CBS, Salant recalled.
He said he had declined to use
"checkbook journalism" to obtain
David Frost's interviews of former
President Richard Nixon. The first two
interviews were "two of the most fas
cinating broadcasts ever," Salant said,
but "it's a question of principle."

Salant has been widely criticized for
paying former Nixon Chief of Staff
H.R. Haldeman $50,000 for an inter
view in 1975, a case which he called a
"mistake,"
"I didn't want to make the same mis
take twice," Salant said. "1 wish we
had been able to see our way clear to
have the interviews on CBS, (but) 1 take
great exception to paying anybody for
being interviewed in hard news, cur
rent news, situations."
After the session, Salent said he was
unclear whether television has re
sulted in a less informed public. "We
oversimplify," he remarked, saying 23
minutes per night to present all the
news puts heavy constraints on jour
nalists.
Time constraints "tend to make
things black and white. But all the
things we have to deal with to
day...have shades of gray."
But he said he couldn't say whether
the public is less informed. "I suspect
people who rely on television as their
sole source of news probably never
read newspapers and never will," he
said. Television news "may be better
than nothing, unless a little know
ledge is a dangerous thing. Then it's a
worse than nothing."
News organizations are "playing
Clod" if they suppress stories because
of their possible consequences, CBS
News President Richard Salant de
clared here Friday when questioned
about news coverage of terrorist ac
tivities.
Salant spoke at a question and ans
wer session in kresge Auditorium
sponsored by the Professional Jour
nalism Fellowship Program.
"We just reject the notion that be
cause...publicity about a terrorist
event will give somebody else an
idea..., we shouldn't report it," Salant
said. He called such suppression
"dangerous."
He added, however, that news or
ganizations should use discretion in
reporting such events. Guidelines
have been set up by CBS and other
news gathering groups for reporting of
i ncidents such as the takeover of three
buildings in Washington. D.C. by Ha
nafi Moslem terrorists recently.
Live interviews
He said reporting on CBS would be
designed to make the incident "no
more sensational than it is." Live in
terviews with terrorists would not be
aired, reporters will cooperate with au
thorities and telephone contact with
terrorists will be restricted to that ap
proved by police among other actions.
He said those guidelines were de
veloped in cooperation with law en
forcement authorities in an effort to
prevent communications tieups and
other media interference with police
In addition, Salant said many
guidelines will make it tougher for ter
rorist groups to use the media as a free
platform for issuance of rhetoric.
Nonetheless, he stressed that "sup
pression is almost never justified." cal
ling it dangerous for word-of-mouth
rumors to take hold.
