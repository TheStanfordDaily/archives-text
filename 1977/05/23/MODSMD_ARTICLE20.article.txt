Crew
Stanford's oarsmen were
caught in rough waters this
weekend which almost cost
them competition in the Pac-8
championships. The Pac-8 de
manded that each school certify
the eligibility of its athletes ac
cording to the NCAA standards.
Stanford's athletic department,
mindful that rowing is consi
dered a club sport and therefore
not under the jurisdiction of the
athletic department, did not
submit such a certification.
Every other Pac-8 school's athle
tic department did. Coach Sam
Francis was not told by anyone
in the upper rungs of the de
partment that he would have to
take care of an eligibility state
ment himself.
Therefore when a check was
finally made on the eve of the
regatta, it was determined that
some Card oarsmen did not meet
NCAA standards.
This was not due to academic
failure — but generally due to
such technicalities as not having
taken a sufficient number of
units since last season.
The final decision was that the
Cards would be allowed to race
— they were not disqualified as
some had first thought the out
come might be. Stanford's in
eligible varsity oarsman, Mike
Glass, was not allowed to com
pete and was replaced by a

member of the varsity four boat.
The Cards lost to Cal in the
opening race Friday by eight
seconds. And on Saturday, the
Stanford crew (with the new
oarsman) took second to UCLA.
"There was a psychological
disadvantage in changing
oarsmen," said Marshall Payne,
a member of the varsity eight.
"Mike Glass was our best star
board oarsman. Some of us think
we could have won if he had
been in."
The JVs beat WSU in their
opening race and then lost to the
University of Washington and
UCLA to garner fourth place.
This was the predicted finish for
the Cards.
The freshman eight lost to Cal
on Saturday by only two sec
onds. The boat got off to a bad
start — which was the rule all
season — and couldn't make up
the deficit. Sunday they raced
against UCLA and lost by 15 sec
onds. They ended up in third
place in the overall champion
ships.
Coach Sam Francis was happy
with the performances of all the
boats but had hoped the varsity
would defeat UCLA. The varsity,
which finished seventh out of
the eight crew teams, was unfor
tunately hurt by the eligibility
ruling.
"If we had beaten UCLA it
would have been a sure sign of
improvement," Payne said.

"The eligibility ruling cost us
fifth place."
Track awards
At the track team's version of
the Oscars last night, James Lof
ton walked away the clear win
ner — much the same way he has
throughout the track season.
By the end of the annual Stan
ford track and field banquet at
Rickey's Hyatt House, Lofton
had journeyed to the mic
rophone five times to accept six
awards: the Most Competitive
Point Winner, Iron Man Award,
John MacFarland Achievement
Award, Judah Memorial Captain
Award, the Citizens Savings
Northern California Outstand
ing Athlete of March and Irving
S. Zeimer Award for the Most
Inspirational Track Athlete.
The banquet, which turned
into a roast of coaches, athletes
and emcees, honored the 1977
track team, the most successful
group of Card cindermen in sev
eral years.
Steve Crowley, like Lofton,
was in need of a U-Haul at the
end of the evening. The senior
1500-meter runner garnered the
Judah Memorial Captain Award,
the Northern California Track
Officials' Outstanding Penin
sula Athlete Award and the A 1
Masters Award for superior
academic and track achieve
ments.
Crowley changed from hon
oree to honorer when he called
Marshall Clark up front to pre
sent the distance coach with the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Golden Spike Award — one
of Crowley's antiquated, and
reputedly malodorous, Adidas
shoes, bronzed, mounted and
autographed.
Assistant coaches Bernie
Oliver and Kenny Kring were

also honored, head coach Payton
Jordan presenting them with
awards for their special con
tributions to the Stanford track
program.
Other awards included:
—The 110 per cent to half
miler Dave Wells.
—The Storey-Young Award
for the most improved runner to

Francis was not told by anyone
in the upper rungs of the de
partment that he would have to
take care of an eligibility state
ment himself.
Therefore when a check was
finally made on the eve of the
regatta, it was determined that
some Card oarsmen did not meet
NCAA standards.
This was not due to academic
failure — but generally due to
such technicalities as not having
taken a sufficient number of
units since last season.
The final decision was that the
Cards would be allowed to race
— they were not disqualified as
some had first thought the out
come might be. Stanford's in
eligible varsity oarsman, Mike
Glass, was not allowed to com
pete and was replaced by a

member of the varsity four boat.
The Cards lost to Cal in the
opening race Friday by eight
seconds. And on Saturday, the
Stanford crew (with the new
oarsman) took second to UCLA.
"There was a psychological
disadvantage in changing
oarsmen," said Marshall Payne,
a member of the varsity eight.
"Mike Glass was our best star
board oarsman. Some of us think
we could have won if he had
been in."
The JVs beat WSU in their
opening race and then lost to the
University of Washington and
UCLA to garner fourth place.
This was the predicted finish for
the Cards.
The freshman eight lost to Cal
on Saturday by only two sec
onds. The boat got off to a bad
start — which was the rule all
season — and couldn't make up
the deficit. Sunday they raced
against UCLA and lost by 15 sec
onds. They ended up in third
place in the overall champion
ships.
Coach Sam Francis was happy
with the performances of all the
boats but had hoped the varsity
would defeat UCLA. The varsity,
which finished seventh out of
the eight crew teams, was unfor
tunately hurt by the eligibility
ruling.
"If we had beaten UCLA it
would have been a sure sign of
improvement," Payne said.

"The eligibility ruling cost us
fifth place."
Track awards
At the track team's version of
the Oscars last night, James Lof
ton walked away the clear win
ner — much the same way he has
throughout the track season.
By the end of the annual Stan
ford track and field banquet at
Rickey's Hyatt House, Lofton
had journeyed to the mic
rophone five times to accept six
awards: the Most Competitive
Point Winner, Iron Man Award,
John MacFarland Achievement
Award, Judah Memorial Captain
Award, the Citizens Savings
Northern California Outstand
ing Athlete of March and Irving
S. Zeimer Award for the Most
Inspirational Track Athlete.
The banquet, which turned
into a roast of coaches, athletes
and emcees, honored the 1977
track team, the most successful
group of Card cindermen in sev
eral years.
Steve Crowley, like Lofton,
was in need of a U-Haul at the
end of the evening. The senior
1500-meter runner garnered the
Judah Memorial Captain Award,
the Northern California Track
Officials' Outstanding Penin
sula Athlete Award and the A 1
Masters Award for superior
academic and track achieve
ments.
Crowley changed from hon
oree to honorer when he called
Marshall Clark up front to pre
sent the distance coach with the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Golden Spike Award — one
of Crowley's antiquated, and
reputedly malodorous, Adidas
shoes, bronzed, mounted and
autographed.
Assistant coaches Bernie
Oliver and Kenny Kring were

also honored, head coach Payton
Jordan presenting them with
awards for their special con
tributions to the Stanford track
program.
Other awards included:
—The 110 per cent to half
miler Dave Wells.
—The Storey-Young Award
for the most improved runner to
quarter-miler Alan Sheats.
—The Jack Weiershauser
Award to the outstanding
freshman to Gordon Banks.
—The Frank Angell Award for

Golf
Junior Mike Peck led the Stan
ford golf team to a 15-12 victory
over California Friday on the
Stanford Golf Course. Peck's
four-under par 67 tied a personal

Stanford's oarsmen were

the eligibility of its athletes ac

Stanford's athletic department,

Cards would be allowed to race
— they were not disqualified as
some had first thought the out
come might be. Stanford's in
eligible varsity oarsman, Mike
Glass, was not allowed to com
pete and was replaced by a

member of the varsity four boat.
The Cards lost to Cal in the
opening race Friday by eight
seconds. And on Saturday, the
Stanford crew (with the new
oarsman) took second to UCLA.
"There was a psychological
disadvantage in changing
oarsmen," said Marshall Payne,
a member of the varsity eight.
"Mike Glass was our best star
board oarsman. Some of us think
we could have won if he had
been in."
The JVs beat WSU in their
opening race and then lost to the
University of Washington and
UCLA to garner fourth place.
This was the predicted finish for
the Cards.
The freshman eight lost to Cal
on Saturday by only two sec
onds. The boat got off to a bad
start — which was the rule all
season — and couldn't make up
the deficit. Sunday they raced
against UCLA and lost by 15 sec
onds. They ended up in third
place in the overall champion
ships.
Coach Sam Francis was happy
with the performances of all the
boats but had hoped the varsity
would defeat UCLA. The varsity,
which finished seventh out of
the eight crew teams, was unfor
tunately hurt by the eligibility
ruling.
"If we had beaten UCLA it
would have been a sure sign of
improvement," Payne said.

"The eligibility ruling cost us
fifth place."
Track awards
At the track team's version of
the Oscars last night, James Lof
ton walked away the clear win
ner — much the same way he has
throughout the track season.
By the end of the annual Stan
ford track and field banquet at
Rickey's Hyatt House, Lofton
had journeyed to the mic
rophone five times to accept six
awards: the Most Competitive
Point Winner, Iron Man Award,
John MacFarland Achievement
Award, Judah Memorial Captain
Award, the Citizens Savings
Northern California Outstand
ing Athlete of March and Irving
S. Zeimer Award for the Most
Inspirational Track Athlete.
The banquet, which turned
into a roast of coaches, athletes
and emcees, honored the 1977
track team, the most successful
group of Card cindermen in sev
eral years.
Steve Crowley, like Lofton,
was in need of a U-Haul at the
end of the evening. The senior
1500-meter runner garnered the
Judah Memorial Captain Award,
the Northern California Track
Officials' Outstanding Penin
sula Athlete Award and the A 1
Masters Award for superior
academic and track achieve
ments.
Crowley changed from hon
oree to honorer when he called
Marshall Clark up front to pre
sent the distance coach with the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Golden Spike Award — one
of Crowley's antiquated, and
reputedly malodorous, Adidas
shoes, bronzed, mounted and
autographed.
Assistant coaches Bernie
Oliver and Kenny Kring were

also honored, head coach Payton
Jordan presenting them with
awards for their special con
tributions to the Stanford track
program.
Other awards included:
—The 110 per cent to half
miler Dave Wells.
—The Storey-Young Award
for the most improved runner to
quarter-miler Alan Sheats.

Golf
Junior Mike Peck led the Stan
ford golf team to a 15-12 victory
over California Friday on the
Stanford Golf Course. Peck's
four-under par 67 tied a personal
best for the par 71 Stanford
course. He had four birdies and
hit every green.
