Arabs threaten new oil embargo
Cairo, Egypt — Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy said yes
terday Arabs would resort once again to an oil embargo if
Israel refuses to withdraw from occupied Arab lands, Cairo
newspapers reported.
Fahmy, speaking in the coastal city of Alexandria, was
commenting on the victories of Israel's right-wing Likud
bloc in elections last Tuesday.
Likud's leader, Menahem Begin, who is expected to be
come the new prime minister, is opposed to Israel's relin
quishing Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war.
Fahmy indicated the oil warning would be conveyed to
President Jimmy Carter by Saudi Crown Prince Fahd on his
visit to Washington this week.
The crown prince will deliver a simple message: "No
matter who governs Israel, we are counting on you to return
the Israeli-occupied territories and give the Palestinians a
homeland."
The Arabs reason that only the United States, Israel's
chief supporter during its 29-year history, has enough
leverage to force territorial concessions from the Jewish
state.
Although the Arab world reacted with alarm to Begin's
victory, the three most influential Arab heads of state —
King Khaled of Saudi Arabia and Presidents Anwar Sadat of
Egypt and Hafez Assad of Syria—decided at a meeting last
Thursday to stay calm and give Carter a chance to deal with
the Likud.
Carter issues warning on Mideast
South Bend, Ind. — President Jimmy Carter delivered a
stern warning yesterday that failure to take advantage of
peace opportunities in the Middle East could be disastrous
not only for the Arabs and Israelis, but for the rest of the
world.
His warning follows the election victory last Tuesday in
Israel of the Likud coalition, whose leader, Menahem Be
gin, has taken a harder line toward peace settlements with
the Arabs than had the ruling Labor party that was defeated.

The president made his remarks in a speech prepared for
delivery at Notre Dame University, where he received an
honorary doctor of laws degree at the annual commence
ment exercises.
Carter expressed confidence in the strength of the Ameri
can democratic system and in its foreign policy, which he
said is "rooted in our moral values," backed "by our mate
rial wealth and by our military power" and "designed to
serve mankind."
The president depicted the commitment to human rights
as the cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.
"We can no longer separate the traditional issues of war
and peace from the new global questions of justice, equity
and human rights," he said.
Speaking on Soviet-U.S. relations, Carter said, "We hope
the Soviet leaders will join us in efforts to stop the spread of
nuclear explosives and to reduce sales of conventional
arms,
"We hope to persuade the Soviet Union that one country
cannot impose its own social system upon another, either
through direct military intervention or through the use of a
client state's military force —as with the Cuban intervention
in Angola."
Mondale reports on African talks
London — Vice President Walter Mondale, winding up a
10-day European diplomatic mission, arrived in London
yesterday and said he could report to British leaders that
progress had been made toward racial peace in Rhodesia.
Mondale flew here from the Belgrade, where he held two
days of talks with President Josip Broz Tito and other
Yugoslav leaders on U.S.-Yugoslavian relations. He was to
meet with Prime Minister James Callaghan and Foreign
Secretary David Owen during his two-day stopover here.
On the flight from Belgrade, Mondale told reporters that
South African Prime Minister John Vorster had agreed to
back a proposal calling for elections in white-ruled
Rhodesia next year.
Mondale met with Vorster last week in Vienna, Austria,
as part of a U.S. diplomatic effort to encourage change in the
policies of racial segregation and white minority rule in
southern Africa.
The vice president told reporters Vorster's commitment
represented progress because the South African leader pre
viously has agreed only to support proposals acceptable to
Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith.
Vorster, whose country is Rhodesia's chief trading part
ner, is regarded as a key figure in the current U.S.-British
campaign to end the guerrilla war and introduce black
majority rule in Rhodesia.

His warning follows the election victory last Tuesday in
Israel of the Likud coalition, whose leader, Menahem Be
gin, has taken a harder line toward peace settlements with
the Arabs than had the ruling Labor party that was defeated.

The president made his remarks in a speech prepared for
delivery at Notre Dame University, where he received an
honorary doctor of laws degree at the annual commence
ment exercises.
Carter expressed confidence in the strength of the Ameri
can democratic system and in its foreign policy, which he
said is "rooted in our moral values," backed "by our mate
rial wealth and by our military power" and "designed to
serve mankind."
The president depicted the commitment to human rights
as the cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.
"We can no longer separate the traditional issues of war
and peace from the new global questions of justice, equity
and human rights," he said.
Speaking on Soviet-U.S. relations, Carter said, "We hope
the Soviet leaders will join us in efforts to stop the spread of
nuclear explosives and to reduce sales of conventional
arms,
"We hope to persuade the Soviet Union that one country
cannot impose its own social system upon another, either
through direct military intervention or through the use of a
client state's military force —as with the Cuban intervention
in Angola."
Mondale reports on African talks
London — Vice President Walter Mondale, winding up a
10-day European diplomatic mission, arrived in London
yesterday and said he could report to British leaders that
progress had been made toward racial peace in Rhodesia.
Mondale flew here from the Belgrade, where he held two
days of talks with President Josip Broz Tito and other
Yugoslav leaders on U.S.-Yugoslavian relations. He was to
meet with Prime Minister James Callaghan and Foreign
Secretary David Owen during his two-day stopover here.
On the flight from Belgrade, Mondale told reporters that
South African Prime Minister John Vorster had agreed to
back a proposal calling for elections in white-ruled
Rhodesia next year.
Mondale met with Vorster last week in Vienna, Austria,
as part of a U.S. diplomatic effort to encourage change in the
policies of racial segregation and white minority rule in
southern Africa.
The vice president told reporters Vorster's commitment
represented progress because the South African leader pre
viously has agreed only to support proposals acceptable to
Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith.
Vorster, whose country is Rhodesia's chief trading part
ner, is regarded as a key figure in the current U.S.-British
campaign to end the guerrilla war and introduce black
majority rule in Rhodesia.

Arabs threaten new oil embargo
Cairo, Egypt — Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy said yes
terday Arabs would resort once again to an oil embargo if
Israel refuses to withdraw from occupied Arab lands, Cairo
newspapers reported.
Fahmy, speaking in the coastal city of Alexandria, was
commenting on the victories of Israel's right-wing Likud
bloc in elections last Tuesday.
Likud's leader, Menahem Begin, who is expected to be
come the new prime minister, is opposed to Israel's relin
quishing Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war.
Fahmy indicated the oil warning would be conveyed to
President Jimmy Carter by Saudi Crown Prince Fahd on his
visit to Washington this week.
The crown prince will deliver a simple message: "No
matter who governs Israel, we are counting on you to return
the Israeli-occupied territories and give the Palestinians a
homeland."
The Arabs reason that only the United States, Israel's
chief supporter during its 29-year history, has enough
leverage to force territorial concessions from the Jewish
state.
Although the Arab world reacted with alarm to Begin's
victory, the three most influential Arab heads of state —
King Khaled of Saudi Arabia and Presidents Anwar Sadat of
Egypt and Hafez Assad of Syria—decided at a meeting last
Thursday to stay calm and give Carter a chance to deal with
the Likud.
