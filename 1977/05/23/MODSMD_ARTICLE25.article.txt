# Strugachs denied exit permit
## Hillel phones Soviet Jew 
### Jordan Lorence 
Mikhail Strugach is a Soviet Jew. In
May 1973, Strugach. his wife Elena
and son Grigory applied for permis
sion to emigrate to Israel. The Soviet
government denied his request. He has
applied three times since then. All
have been denied.
Soon after his first try, he lost his job
as a fluidics engineer. He has been ar
rested by the Soviet police (KGB). His
apartment has been burglarized. He
writes, "we have not any changes. All
is the same, waiting, waiting...."
Thursday night at the Bechtel Inter
national Center, a group of students
here listened to Mikhail Strugach tell
his story over the telephone from
Leningrad.
Robert Roos and Brian Rosman
placed the Hillel-sponsored call. Ros
man is a freshman here; Roos is a visit
ing student from the University of
Arizona. The two have made five other
attempts to call Strugach in the past
three years. All but the first have been
successful.
A telegram
Roos sent a telegram to Strugach, tel
ling him to expect a call at Leningrad
Central Post Office. The phone was
hooked up to a speaker so the audience
of 50 could hear the call.
Roos and Rosman prepared 15 ques
tions, asking Strugach if he was work
ing, if he had applied again for a visa
(he had) and how other "refuseniks"
were faring. (These Jews call them
selves refuseniks after the Soviets
deny their emigration requests.)
They made two calls. The first con
nection was faint. They tried again.
The second call was louder, but still
very difficult to understand. Each call
is taped, so hard-to-understand por
tions can be replayed.
Students here may not have been the
only ones listening in. The KGB is
known to tap in on such calls, Roos
said. He said KGB workers will try to
disrupt portions of conversations they
don't want Westerners to hear.
Extremely garbled
When asked how three other dissi
dents were doing, Strugach's voice be
came extremely garbled. When other
questions were asked, the garbling
stopped.
Strugach was arrested by the KGB
and held for 15 days en" route to the
first phone call in April 1974. The New
York Times found out about the arrest
an published several stories on
Strugach and the attempted call. Since
then, Strugach has been allowed to

take calls from the West.
"The arrest was the best thing that
could have happened to him," Roos
said. "The Soviet government is sensi
tive to Western criticism, especially in
the press. Such publicity is life insur
ance for refuseniks."
An exit visa
Rosman said Strugach has been de
nied an exit visa because he knows
"state secrets." This is a common
reason given for refusal, although
many Jews knowing "state secrets"
have been allowed to emigrate in the
past.
Roos said Soviets don't want Jews to
leave for several reasons. First, many
Jews are well-trained, and the Soviet
economy cannot afford to lose them.
Second, emigration embarrasses the
Russians, pointing out a failure in the
Soviet system.
Also, allowing some emigration en
courages more and more Jews to seek

permission to leave. Fourth, Arab gov
ernments pressure Russia not to allow
Jews to emigrate, because it bolsters
Israel's manpower.
Roos and Rosman exchange letters
with Strugach and send him things he
requests. The two arranged for a 16-
volume engineering set to be sent to
Strugach through the office of Rep.
Morris Udall (D-Ariz.).
Since Strugach is unemployed (fre
quently Jews are fired when they apply
to emigrcte), Roos and Rosman sent
him a pair of Levi's jeans and a Levi's
jean jacket. Strugach reported selling
them for $150 in Leningrad.
Roos urged the audience to write to
Russian leaders, protesting their
treatment of Jews. He also asked for
letters to be sent to Strugach and other
dissidents, to buoy their spirits while
they wait for permission to leave for
Israel.

"The arrest was the best thing that
could have happened to him," Roos
said. "The Soviet government is sensi
tive to Western criticism, especially in
the press. Such publicity is life insur
ance for refuseniks."
An exit visa
Rosman said Strugach has been de
nied an exit visa because he knows
"state secrets." This is a common
reason given for refusal, although
many Jews knowing "state secrets"
have been allowed to emigrate in the
past.
Roos said Soviets don't want Jews to
leave for several reasons. First, many
Jews are well-trained, and the Soviet
economy cannot afford to lose them.
Second, emigration embarrasses the
Russians, pointing out a failure in the
Soviet system.
Also, allowing some emigration en
courages more and more Jews to seek

permission to leave. Fourth, Arab gov
ernments pressure Russia not to allow
Jews to emigrate, because it bolsters
Israel's manpower.
Roos and Rosman exchange letters
with Strugach and send him things he
requests. The two arranged for a 16-
volume engineering set to be sent to
Strugach through the office of Rep.
Morris Udall (D-Ariz.).
Since Strugach is unemployed (fre
quently Jews are fired when they apply
to emigrcte), Roos and Rosman sent
him a pair of Levi's jeans and a Levi's
jean jacket. Strugach reported selling
them for $150 in Leningrad.
Roos urged the audience to write to
Russian leaders, protesting their
treatment of Jews. He also asked for
letters to be sent to Strugach and other
dissidents, to buoy their spirits while
they wait for permission to leave for
Israel.
Mikhail Strugach is a Soviet Jew. In
May 1973, Strugach. his wife Elena
and son Grigory applied for permis
sion to emigrate to Israel. The Soviet
government denied his request. He has
applied three times since then. All
have been denied.
Soon after his first try, he lost his job
as a fluidics engineer. He has been ar
rested by the Soviet police (KGB). His
apartment has been burglarized. He
writes, "we have not any changes. All
is the same, waiting, waiting...."
Thursday night at the Bechtel Inter
national Center, a group of students
here listened to Mikhail Strugach tell
his story over the telephone from
Leningrad.
Robert Roos and Brian Rosman
placed the Hillel-sponsored call. Ros
man is a freshman here; Roos is a visit
ing student from the University of
Arizona. The two have made five other
attempts to call Strugach in the past
three years. All but the first have been
successful.
A telegram
Roos sent a telegram to Strugach, tel
ling him to expect a call at Leningrad
Central Post Office. The phone was
hooked up to a speaker so the audience
of 50 could hear the call.
Roos and Rosman prepared 15 ques
tions, asking Strugach if he was work
ing, if he had applied again for a visa
(he had) and how other "refuseniks"
were faring. (These Jews call them
selves refuseniks after the Soviets
deny their emigration requests.)
They made two calls. The first con
nection was faint. They tried again.
The second call was louder, but still
very difficult to understand. Each call
is taped, so hard-to-understand por
tions can be replayed.
Students here may not have been the
only ones listening in. The KGB is
known to tap in on such calls, Roos
said. He said KGB workers will try to
disrupt portions of conversations they
don't want Westerners to hear.
Extremely garbled
When asked how three other dissi
dents were doing, Strugach's voice be
came extremely garbled. When other
questions were asked, the garbling
stopped.
Strugach was arrested by the KGB
and held for 15 days en" route to the
first phone call in April 1974. The New
York Times found out about the arrest
an published several stories on
Strugach and the attempted call. Since
then, Strugach has been allowed to

take calls from the West.
"The arrest was the best thing that
could have happened to him," Roos
said. "The Soviet government is sensi
tive to Western criticism, especially in
the press. Such publicity is life insur
