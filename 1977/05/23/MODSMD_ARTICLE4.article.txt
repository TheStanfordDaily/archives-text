# Old Union protesters face arraignment
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Arraignments will begin this morn
ing in Palo Alto Municipal Court for
the 294 persons arrested in the May 9
sit-in at Old Union protesting the Uni
versity's investments in South Africa.
Most of the 270 students arrested
will probably plead not guilty, accord
ing to attorney Ron Romines, of the
Palo Alto law firm Romines and Eich
ner, which has been assisting in the
students' defense.
Charges filed against those arrested,
are two counts of trespassing, and fail- .
ing to leave the scene of an unlawful

assembly, Homines said.
The long process of arraignments
will continue through next week.
Actual entry of pleas will be delayed
possibly until June 10, because "most
people don't have attorneys to repre
sent them at this point," Homines said.
Ten to 15 lawyers have been con
tacted to act on behalf of those ar
rested, but no extensive contacts have
been made, Homines said, because of
lack of time and the large number of
persons involved.
Municipal Court Judge Scoyen has
indicated he may offer those arrested
six months probation and a $50 fine it
they plead guilty to one of the charges.
"This is a fairly standard kind of
plea bargain," Homines said. The offer
has not yet been formally conveyed to
anyone, and has yet to be approved by
the district attorney, he added.
On Thursday, five students, some of
whom were arrested at the sit-in. will
meet with President Richard Lyman,
Trustee William Eberleand Peter Ming,
president of the Board of Trustees, to
discuss the University's investments
policy.
The trustees will receive three posi
tion papers on Thursday, according to
Steve Vettel, one student who will be
meeting with them.
One deals with the "legitimacy and
illegitimacy" of the May 9 sit-in, he
said. The other two. more lengthy pap
ers contest the trustees' stated position
on investments in South Africa and
critique investment policy here.
Spurred by recent actions here pro
testing University investments in
South Africa, representatives from or
ganizations from 10 Bay Area cam
puses have formed Campuses United
Against Apartheid (CIJAA), in an ef
fort to form a statewide mass move
ment, according to Anne Henkels, an
ASSU co-president who presided over
CUAA's first meeting last Sunday.
CUAA called for coordinated ac
tions on campuses throughout the
state on May 26 to protest campus in
vestments in South Africa, in a San
Francisco press conference on Friday.

CIJAA also released a list of three
demands, which call for an end to
campus investments in South Africa,
withdrawal of the United States from
Southern Africa, and an end to racist
apartheid rule.
Members of CIJAA include organi
zations from Stanford, UC-Berkeley,
UC-Santa Cruz, San "Francisco City
College, San Jose State, University of
San Francisco, UC-Davis, San Fran
cisco State, San Jose City College and
University of Santa Clara.

Students and the regents of the Uni
versity of California will meet to dis
cuss South African investments to
morrow afternoon at Berkeley.
Announcement of the meeting took
place at a meeting of the regents in
vestment committee in San Francisco
on Thursday. The committee also an
nounced its decision to draft letters to
every company in the University of
California's stock portfolio expressing
concern about business practices in
South Africa.
