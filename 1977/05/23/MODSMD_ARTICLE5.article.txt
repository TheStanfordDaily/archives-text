Johannesburg, South Africa (AP) â€”
Andrew Young ended a two-day visit
to South Africa yesterday by embrac
ing a black nationalist leader and dec
laring that blacks here should use
economic boycotts as a weapon to
force change in the white govern
ment's racial policies.
Young, the black U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, whose outspo
kenness in the past has aroused the ire
of many white South Africans, expres
sed some wide-ranging views yester
day. He told largely white audiences
that Russians are racists. Jimmy Carter
was an Afrikaaner, and that it was the
police, not black students, who rioted
in the black township of Soweto last
year.
Young also made one of his sharpest
attacks yet on white-minority govern
ments in southern Africa. He accused
lan Smith's Rhodesian regime of "sys
tematic oppression and death
dealing" and said later that with
"minor qualifications" the same
applied to the South African govern
ment.
Young preached his message that
change in South Africa be effected
through economic and diplomatic
pressure, instead of violence, to varied
audiences of businessmen, students
and newspaper editors.
Final leg
He left last night for Zambia and will
then go on to Sudan on the final leg of a
two-week African tour.
At a reception yesterday at the U.S.
Information Service center, Young
threw his arms around black
nationalist leader Chief Gatsha
Buthelezi and joined in singing the
nationalist anthem "Nkesi Sikeleli Af
rika" ("God Bless Africa").
Buthelezi is political leader of South

Africa's largest black tribe, the Zulus,
and head of a growing black political
cultural movement called Inkatha.
The reception was attended by
white liberals, representatives of
mixed-race and Asian South Africans,
and a sprinkling ol black nationalists.
Young told the audience at the re
ception that on principle he would
oppose the stepped-up black guerrilla
war in Rhodesia.
Asked whether he would like to see
South African blacks pressure the
white government by boycotting white
businesses, as American blacks did in
the civil rights movement, Young re
plied: "I sure would."
He said the fact that racial issues are
freely discussed in South Africa and
the United States "means that we are
more likely to come up with relevant
solutions than, say, the Russians, who
are racists and don't admit it."
With a broad grin, Young compared
President Jimmy Carter to the Dutch
descended Afrikaaners, the backbone
of South Africa's white minority and
the country's staunchest defenders of
racial segregation.
"1 think Jimmy Carter is an Af
rikaaner," Young said to laughter from
his audience. "He comes out of that
same rural, hardnosed stock. . .
'Out-tough'
"1 just figure you've met your
match," he continued. "I mean, you
can out-tough some of these Hritish
liberals, but 1 don't think you can out
tough the folks that are running the
U.S. now."
Young said that until recently, the
racial climate in the United States was
in some ways more brutal than in
South Africa, but "you are catching up
with us real fast, with the recent police
riots in Soweto.
"It was not the children that rioted"
at Soweto, Young said. "It was the
police that rioted." He was referring to
bloody antigovernment disturbances
that began last June in the black town
ship of Soweto, near Johannesburg.
South Africa's white government,
whose legitimacy Young has ques
tioned, almost refused to allow his
two-day visit after it learned that
Young hoped to meet with black dissi
dents here.
Although he did not meet with black
militants, Young reportedly sent a pri
vate note to Winnie Mandela, wife of
jailed black nationalist Nelson Man
dela.
