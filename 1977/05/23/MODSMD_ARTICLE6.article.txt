The Faculty Senate Task Force an Western Culture has
proposed four possible plans to fill the Western Culture
requirement, and is now accepting community criticism,
according to Task Force Chairman Ronald Rebholz, as
sociate English professor.
Three of the four plans involved a core class plus addi
tional satellite or small-group courses to be taken by the
student. The other plan involves taking a course in one
particular area relating to Western Culture. It would take
three quarters to fulfil 1 the requ irement i n each of the plans.
The task force was formed by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-IJS) after the Faculty Senate voted last
December to reinstitute an undergraduate requirement in
western culture beginning with students entering in tall
1978. The original requirement was dropped in 1969.
The first plan consists of a common reading list to be used
by all students filling the requirement. The reading would
be discussed in small groups, ranging anywhere from three
to 15 students per group.
'Satellite course'
Iiraddition to this small-group class, students would take
a "satellite course" that would "orbit" around the material
in thereading list, "intimately related to it but with distinc
tive emphasis," according to Rebholz.
Members of the task force differed in their opinion of
what the common reading list should emphasize. Some
thought the list should emphasize the history of political,
social and economic institutions while others wanted it to
emphasize intellectual and literary history.
Proposed topics for satellite courses ranged from the his
tory of institutions and literature to the relationship of
technology and society. Students would take three satellite
courses to fulfill the requirement, Rebholz said.
In the second proposal of the task force, students would
have a choiceof two cores, one on the history ot institutions.

and the other on intellectual and literary history. The cori'
would be taught in large lecture courses ratherthan in small
groups as in the first plan.
Two core classes
One reason for having a choice of two core classes, ac
cording to Rebholz, was because the committee could not
agree on the emphasis in the core.
Satellite courses would be incorporated in the second
plan as they were in the first.
The third plan consists of a merger of the first two. "Prim
ary works" would be studied in small groups, and their
relationships to political, social, economic and intellectual
contexts would be studied in lectures, Rebholz said.
Primary works include philosophical and theological
works and works by historians and economic or social
theorists, Rebholz said.
Fourth plan
The fourth plan entails students choosing from a number
of different "tracks," These would be similar in subject
matter to the satellite courses in the other plans.
A problem inherent in the first three plans is "theconflict
between a desire for historical coverage and a distaste for
superficiality." Rebholz said. The core courses "would
have to vary degrees of intensity and superficiality," he
added.
The second and third plans have an advantage over the
first plan, Rebholz contended, because the historical cover
age can be more easily achieved in lectures rather than in
small-group discussions. The task force "tentatively pref
ers" the third plan.
The first three plans involve the "problem of money to
pay for excellent instructors and instruction in small
groups," Rebholz said. The fourth plan would be easiest to
implement within existing structures, he said.
C-US will review the proposals of the task force early next
month.
