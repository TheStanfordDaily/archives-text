# Faculty opposition to apartheid needed
##

Robert Keohane

In recent weeks students at Stanford have
initiated discussions of apartheid in South
Africa and its relevance to this community.
Many faculty members support the students'
objectives and respect their actions. Yet,
since the faculty has been less visibly de
monstrative than the students, questions
have been raised about whether a "substan
tial consensus" exists among faculty mem
bers that Stanford should change its policies
toward corporations in which the University
holds stock that operate in South Africa.
In an effort to demonstrate such a consen
sus, several faculty members have drafted the
following statement, which we hope many of
our colleagues will sign:
"We the undersigned members of the fa
culty of Stanford University affirm our
abhorrence of racial discrimination and op
pression in South Africa. We uige Stanford
University to take a stand against Apartheid
that is consonant with its position as a moral
and intellectual leader in American society.
"Together with the members of the Stan
ford Committee for Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP), we call upon the University
to take an unequivocal position in discourag
ing expansion and/or continuation of U.S.
corporate presence in South Africa.
"We do not believe expanding or continu
ing operations in South Africa wil 1 lead to the
abandoning of Apartheid, or that it will help,
or even be perceived as helping the Black
populations there. Whatever the intentions of

American corporations, the evidence seems
overwhelming that the laws and customs of
the white minority will effectively prevent
American corporate presence from acting as a
significant force to bring about economic and
social justice.
"What that presence expresses to Africans
is rather American confidence in the coun
try's present order, its stability, and its
legitimacy.
"We therefore ask that the Stanford Trus
tees and Administration:
"1) adopt a policy of voting in favor of
shareholder proposals which call for with
drawal or non-expansion of South African
investments by U.S. corporations in which
the University holds stock, and
"2) consider the reconstitution of the Pres
ident's Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) in order that it may more
fully reflect the diversity of the University
community."
I wish to emphasize that this statement
does not call for the university to divest itself
of any corporate stock, merely that it support
proposals requiring that corporations with
draw, or fail to expand, their investments in
South Africa. We are not under the illusion
that such proposals will be adopted: man
agement regularly receives over 90 per cent of
the vote in such matters.
Symbolic purpose
The purpose is symbolic and educational: to
dramatize the illegitimacy of the present

South African regime and to stimulate a dis
cussion of the political risks (as well as the
moral costs) of extensive American involve
ment in South Africa. It is quite possible that
at some point during the next decade or two,
widespread civil war will take place in South
Africa, and that the United States will be
urged to intervene on behalf of the repressive
regime there in order "to protect our military
and economic interests." Against this even
tuality, we should begin now to educate pub
lic opinion about the nature of the South Af
rican regime, and the utter folly of interven
tion. Continued passivity by Stanford and
other major universities would make it more
difficult to begin such a process of public
education. Voting university-owned shares
against corporate involvement in South Af
rica could reinforce attempts to generate pub
lic discussion of apartheid. It seems clear that
such action is witliin Stanford's legitimate
sphere.
The faculty members circulating the state
ment believe that Stanford should go some
what farther and participate in initiating as
well as reacting to proposals to change corpo
rate policies toward South Africa. The re
quest in the statement that the President's
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) be reconstituted reflects that belief. CIR
has been passive during its years of existence.
Effective implementation of an active and re
sponsible investment policy, therefore, will
require reconstitution of the committee.

In response to such arguments, it has been
said that universities should not act as politi
cal bodies, since this exposes them to grave
risks. At one level, this is surely true:*t would
be foolish for a university to become directly
involved in partisan politics. At another
level, however, the claim that a modern uni
versity is non-political cannot be sustained.
Stanford regularly takes positions on issues
before the United States Congress and
California legislature, and actively lobbies for
bills designed to assist higher education.
Thus, the claim of being "non-political"
appears to be an argument that the university
should be involved, as a university, in politi
cal activity only where its material interests
are directly affected. Where "only" the fun
damental principles of a university are at
stake — such as our opposition to racial dis
crimination — the univeristy is to be silent.
Does it not seem perverse thus to raise
narrowly-defined self-interest to a principle?
If the simple argument that "the University
is not a political body" collapses, what limits
to public activity should it impose upon it
self? I suggest, first, that where the University
acts on public issues it should concentrate on
increasing the salience of informed debate
and on improving the quality of discourse.
It might well take actions (such as initiat
ing proxy resolutions) that reinforce or sym
bolize its arguments; but it should leave tasks
of political organization and lobbying to
others.

Second, I believe that University actions
designed to influence public policy should
bear a direct relationship either to the Uni
versity's material interests or to the funda
mental principles of free inquiry and nondis
criminatory treatment, on which its very jus
tification depends.
Criteria inapplicable
These criteria cannot be applied mechani
cally; but they indicate that to urge the uni
versity to take positions on public issues is
hardly to demand its "politicization" or to
require that it become involved in every good
cause.
Decisions on tactics involve not merely is
sues of judgment, but trade-offs between val
ues. The enormity of apartheid and the dan
gers of American involvement with it
suggest the desirability of an active Univer
sity investment policy. The criteria listed
above indicate that such a policy can be pur
sued without skidding down the slippery
slope of "politicization." If our concern about
apartheid is genuine and deep, we should be
willing to run the risk that others will be
annoyed at our outspokenness.
The faculty members circulating this
statement hope that members of the Stanford
community will seriously consider these is
sues, and make personal judgments on them.
We invite all members of the Stanford faculty
to sign the statement printed above.

In recent weeks students at Stanford have
initiated discussions of apartheid in South
Africa and its relevance to this community.
Many faculty members support the students'
objectives and respect their actions. Yet,
since the faculty has been less visibly de
monstrative than the students, questions
have been raised about whether a "substan
tial consensus" exists among faculty mem
bers that Stanford should change its policies
toward corporations in which the University
holds stock that operate in South Africa.
In an effort to demonstrate such a consen
sus, several faculty members have drafted the
following statement, which we hope many of
our colleagues will sign:
"We the undersigned members of the fa
culty of Stanford University affirm our
abhorrence of racial discrimination and op
pression in South Africa. We uige Stanford
University to take a stand against Apartheid
that is consonant with its position as a moral
and intellectual leader in American society.
"Together with the members of the Stan
ford Committee for Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP), we call upon the University
to take an unequivocal position in discourag
ing expansion and/or continuation of U.S.
corporate presence in South Africa.
"We do not believe expanding or continu
ing operations in South Africa wil 1 lead to the
abandoning of Apartheid, or that it will help,
or even be perceived as helping the Black
populations there. Whatever the intentions of

American corporations, the evidence seems
overwhelming that the laws and customs of
the white minority will effectively prevent
American corporate presence from acting as a
significant force to bring about economic and
social justice.
"What that presence expresses to Africans
is rather American confidence in the coun
try's present order, its stability, and its
legitimacy.
"We therefore ask that the Stanford Trus
tees and Administration:
"1) adopt a policy of voting in favor of
shareholder proposals which call for with
drawal or non-expansion of South African
investments by U.S. corporations in which
the University holds stock, and
"2) consider the reconstitution of the Pres
ident's Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) in order that it may more
fully reflect the diversity of the University
community."
I wish to emphasize that this statement
does not call for the university to divest itself
of any corporate stock, merely that it support
proposals requiring that corporations with
draw, or fail to expand, their investments in
South Africa. We are not under the illusion
that such proposals will be adopted: man
agement regularly receives over 90 per cent of
the vote in such matters.
Symbolic purpose
The purpose is symbolic and educational: to
dramatize the illegitimacy of the present

South African regime and to stimulate a dis
cussion of the political risks (as well as the
moral costs) of extensive American involve
ment in South Africa. It is quite possible that
at some point during the next decade or two,
widespread civil war will take place in South
Africa, and that the United States will be
urged to intervene on behalf of the repressive
regime there in order "to protect our military
and economic interests." Against this even
tuality, we should begin now to educate pub
lic opinion about the nature of the South Af
rican regime, and the utter folly of interven
tion. Continued passivity by Stanford and
other major universities would make it more
difficult to begin such a process of public
education. Voting university-owned shares
against corporate involvement in South Af
rica could reinforce attempts to generate pub
lic discussion of apartheid. It seems clear that
such action is witliin Stanford's legitimate
sphere.
The faculty members circulating the state
ment believe that Stanford should go some
what farther and participate in initiating as
well as reacting to proposals to change corpo
rate policies toward South Africa. The re
quest in the statement that the President's
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) be reconstituted reflects that belief. CIR
has been passive during its years of existence.
Effective implementation of an active and re
sponsible investment policy, therefore, will
require reconstitution of the committee.

In response to such arguments, it has been
said that universities should not act as politi
cal bodies, since this exposes them to grave
risks. At one level, this is surely true:*t would
be foolish for a university to become directly
involved in partisan politics. At another
level, however, the claim that a modern uni
versity is non-political cannot be sustained.
Stanford regularly takes positions on issues
before the United States Congress and
California legislature, and actively lobbies for
bills designed to assist higher education.
Thus, the claim of being "non-political"
appears to be an argument that the university
should be involved, as a university, in politi
cal activity only where its material interests
are directly affected. Where "only" the fun
damental principles of a university are at
stake — such as our opposition to racial dis
crimination — the univeristy is to be silent.
Does it not seem perverse thus to raise
narrowly-defined self-interest to a principle?
If the simple argument that "the University
is not a political body" collapses, what limits
to public activity should it impose upon it
self? I suggest, first, that where the University
acts on public issues it should concentrate on
increasing the salience of informed debate
and on improving the quality of discourse.
It might well take actions (such as initiat
ing proxy resolutions) that reinforce or sym
bolize its arguments; but it should leave tasks
of political organization and lobbying to
others.

Second, I believe that University actions
designed to influence public policy should
bear a direct relationship either to the Uni
versity's material interests or to the funda
mental principles of free inquiry and nondis
criminatory treatment, on which its very jus
tification depends.
Criteria inapplicable
These criteria cannot be applied mechani
cally; but they indicate that to urge the uni
versity to take positions on public issues is
hardly to demand its "politicization" or to
require that it become involved in every good
cause.
Decisions on tactics involve not merely is

is not a political body" collapses, what limits
to public activity should it impose upon it
self? I suggest, first, that where the University
acts on public issues it should concentrate on
increasing the salience of informed debate
and on improving the quality of discourse.
It might well take actions (such as initiat
ing proxy resolutions) that reinforce or sym
bolize its arguments; but it should leave tasks
of political organization and lobbying to
others.

Second, I believe that University actions
designed to influence public policy should
bear a direct relationship either to the Uni
versity's material interests or to the funda
mental principles of free inquiry and nondis
criminatory treatment, on which its very jus
tification depends.
Criteria inapplicable
These criteria cannot be applied mechani
cally; but they indicate that to urge the uni
versity to take positions on public issues is
hardly to demand its "politicization" or to
require that it become involved in every good
cause.
Decisions on tactics involve not merely is
sues of judgment, but trade-offs between val
ues. The enormity of apartheid and the dan
gers of American involvement with it
suggest the desirability of an active Univer
sity investment policy. The criteria listed
above indicate that such a policy can be pur
sued without skidding down the slippery
slope of "politicization." If our concern about
apartheid is genuine and deep, we should be
willing to run the risk that others will be
annoyed at our outspokenness.
The faculty members circulating this
statement hope that members of the Stanford
community will seriously consider these is
sues, and make personal judgments on them.
We invite all members of the Stanford faculty
to sign the statement printed above.

In recent weeks students at Stanford have
initiated discussions of apartheid in South
Africa and its relevance to this community.
Many faculty members support the students'
objectives and respect their actions. Yet,
since the faculty has been less visibly de
monstrative than the students, questions
have been raised about whether a "substan
tial consensus" exists among faculty mem
bers that Stanford should change its policies
toward corporations in which the University
holds stock that operate in South Africa.
In an effort to demonstrate such a consen
sus, several faculty members have drafted the
following statement, which we hope many of
our colleagues will sign:
"We the undersigned members of the fa
culty of Stanford University affirm our
abhorrence of racial discrimination and op
pression in South Africa. We uige Stanford
University to take a stand against Apartheid
that is consonant with its position as a moral
and intellectual leader in American society.
"Together with the members of the Stan
ford Committee for Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP), we call upon the University
to take an unequivocal position in discourag
ing expansion and/or continuation of U.S.
corporate presence in South Africa.
"We do not believe expanding or continu
ing operations in South Africa wil 1 lead to the
abandoning of Apartheid, or that it will help,
or even be perceived as helping the Black
populations there. Whatever the intentions of

American corporations, the evidence seems
overwhelming that the laws and customs of
the white minority will effectively prevent
American corporate presence from acting as a
significant force to bring about economic and
social justice.
"What that presence expresses to Africans
is rather American confidence in the coun
try's present order, its stability, and its
legitimacy.
"We therefore ask that the Stanford Trus
tees and Administration:
"1) adopt a policy of voting in favor of
shareholder proposals which call for with
drawal or non-expansion of South African
investments by U.S. corporations in which
the University holds stock, and
"2) consider the reconstitution of the Pres
ident's Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) in order that it may more
fully reflect the diversity of the University
community."
I wish to emphasize that this statement
does not call for the university to divest itself
of any corporate stock, merely that it support
proposals requiring that corporations with
draw, or fail to expand, their investments in
South Africa. We are not under the illusion
that such proposals will be adopted: man
agement regularly receives over 90 per cent of
the vote in such matters.
Symbolic purpose
The purpose is symbolic and educational: to
dramatize the illegitimacy of the present

South African regime and to stimulate a dis
cussion of the political risks (as well as the
moral costs) of extensive American involve
ment in South Africa. It is quite possible that
at some point during the next decade or two,
widespread civil war will take place in South
Africa, and that the United States will be
urged to intervene on behalf of the repressive
regime there in order "to protect our military
and economic interests." Against this even
tuality, we should begin now to educate pub
lic opinion about the nature of the South Af
rican regime, and the utter folly of interven
tion. Continued passivity by Stanford and
other major universities would make it more
difficult to begin such a process of public
education. Voting university-owned shares
against corporate involvement in South Af
rica could reinforce attempts to generate pub
lic discussion of apartheid. It seems clear that
such action is witliin Stanford's legitimate
sphere.
The faculty members circulating the state
ment believe that Stanford should go some
what farther and participate in initiating as
well as reacting to proposals to change corpo
rate policies toward South Africa. The re
quest in the statement that the President's
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) be reconstituted reflects that belief. CIR
has been passive during its years of existence.
Effective implementation of an active and re
sponsible investment policy, therefore, will
require reconstitution of the committee.

In response to such arguments, it has been
said that universities should not act as politi
cal bodies, since this exposes them to grave
risks. At one level, this is surely true:*t would
be foolish for a university to become directly
involved in partisan politics. At another
level, however, the claim that a modern uni
versity is non-political cannot be sustained.
Stanford regularly takes positions on issues
before the United States Congress and
California legislature, and actively lobbies for
bills designed to assist higher education.
Thus, the claim of being "non-political"
appears to be an argument that the university
should be involved, as a university, in politi
cal activity only where its material interests
are directly affected. Where "only" the fun
damental principles of a university are at
stake — such as our opposition to racial dis
crimination — the univeristy is to be silent.
Does it not seem perverse thus to raise
narrowly-defined self-interest to a principle?
If the simple argument that "the University
is not a political body" collapses, what limits
to public activity should it impose upon it
self? I suggest, first, that where the University
acts on public issues it should concentrate on
