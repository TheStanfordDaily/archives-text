# Childcare services called inadequate
## 
### 
Chapek et al.

Student education and scho
larly research are the accepted
goals of Stanford University. In
our opinion, the accomplish
ment of these goals is hindered
by a lack of adequate childcare
services. The problem is perva
sive in that it affects all segments
of the Stanford community — fa
culty, staff and students.
Recent and accurate data on
the need for childcare services is
unavailable. There are over 2000
married students, many of
whom are parents.
Students have a need for reli
able, convenient, inexpensive
childcare. Students with
families, mostly graduates, not
only attend classes and conduct
research, they also must provide
the emotional and financial es
sentials to their children. With
out adequate childcare services,
the student's ability to take full
advantage of Stanford's educa
tional offerings is greatly re
duced.
Childcare available
Faculty and staff face parallel
problems. The availability of
childcare services can be a factor
in Stanford's continued ability
to attract high-quality faculty
and staff. Although there may be
an overabundance of employ
able Ph.Ds, administrators and
support staff, the brightest
young professionals and the ab
lest personnel usually have job
opportunities at several univer
sities. Provision of care for their
children is one factor that could
influence their ultimate deci
sion.
Current and planned oncam
pus childcare programs do not
meet the need for such services.
Existing facilities generally have
long waiting lists. It is almost cer
tain that SNAP (the Stanford
New Afterschool Program), will
be filled to capacity when it
opens next fall. Currently many
childcare problems require in
dividual solutions, such as skip
ping classes when a child is ill or
leaving children unattended in
order to go to class, use reserve
materials at the library and
punch keys at the computer
center.
Stanford residents are ineligi

ble for Palo Alto city childcare
programs. Other licensed cen
ters and daycare homes are gen
erally full and at a sufficient dis
tance from campus that they
pose a serious transportation
problem. Individual babysitters
are also of varying quality and
reliability.
The current costs of services,
even where they exist, are not
insubstantial. Childcare center
fees range from a minimum of
$75 to well over $100 per month
per child. Babysitters are also
expensive. As a group, student
parents have severely limited fi
nancial resources, especially
since childcare costs are not pre

sently included in the basic Uni
versity financial aid package.
This year the Santa Clara County
Child Care Pilot Study has sub
sidized many Stanford families,
but unfortunately the subsidies
are scheduled to end in June.
Official University policy on
childcare has been stated in a
memorandum prefacing the
Childcare Policy Study — Stan
ford 1972 by Aimee Dorr Leifer.
The guiding principle is one of
minimal University involve
ment in childcare, which means
no commitment of major re
sources in terms of land or fund
ing. This statement also assigns
primary responsibility for

"facilitating workable childcare
arrangements" to the Dean of
Student Affairs Office. The pol
icy does allow for childcare re
ferral services and a childcare
consultant position, although
the funding remains very li
mited for these efforts.
Committee set
In response to childcare
needs, a student-sponsored
Committee on Childcare was es
tablished last year to propose and
actively pursue solutions. This
committee's efforts have re
sulted in the planned construc
tion of a facility to house the
SNAP afterschool program and a
morning infant-care program.

In our opinion childcare op
portunities for students, staff
and faculty remain inadequate.
Both Stanford University and
the families involved suffer as a
result. Therefore, we make the
following suggestions:
(1) The collection, compilation
and distribution of demographic
statistics within the entire Stan
ford community. A few ques
tions posed annually on student
registration forms would suffice
to indicate some of the potential
demand for childcare. At the
very minimum, marital status
and the number and ages of de
pendents should be ascertained.
(2)Formal recognition by the
University of childcare as a need
within the Stanford community.
Currently, childcare (as both a
problem and a service) is viewed
as existing "at" Stanford. In this,
as in other aspects, the families
of Stanford students and per
sonnel must become legitimate
members "of" Stanford.
(3) Serious attention to the fi
nancial burden of childcare.
On-campus centers provide scho
larships whenever possible, but
these resources are slim.
Child-related costs also should be
considered in the granting of fi
nancial aid.
(4) Adequate funding of the
childcare consultant position.
This is an indispensable ad
ministrative position concerned
with childcare issues. Since the
childcare consultant's services
are utilized by faculty and staff
as well as students, funds pro
vided by the Dean of Student Af
fairs Office for the consultant
position should be
supplemented by monies from
faculty and staff sources.
(5) Reevaluation of official
childcare policy. A revised pol
icy that goes beyond facilitation
should be established, which
would encourage responsible
commitment of University re
sources to childcare service.

Student education and scho
larly research are the accepted
goals of Stanford University. In
our opinion, the accomplish
ment of these goals is hindered
by a lack of adequate childcare
services. The problem is perva
sive in that it affects all segments
of the Stanford community — fa
culty, staff and students.
Recent and accurate data on
the need for childcare services is
unavailable. There are over 2000
married students, many of
whom are parents.
Students have a need for reli
able, convenient, inexpensive
childcare. Students with
families, mostly graduates, not
only attend classes and conduct
research, they also must provide
the emotional and financial es
sentials to their children. With
out adequate childcare services,
the student's ability to take full
advantage of Stanford's educa
tional offerings is greatly re
duced.
Childcare available
Faculty and staff face parallel
problems. The availability of
childcare services can be a factor
in Stanford's continued ability
to attract high-quality faculty
and staff. Although there may be
an overabundance of employ
able Ph.Ds, administrators and
support staff, the brightest
young professionals and the ab
lest personnel usually have job
opportunities at several univer
sities. Provision of care for their
children is one factor that could
influence their ultimate deci
sion.
Current and planned oncam
pus childcare programs do not
meet the need for such services.
Existing facilities generally have
long waiting lists. It is almost cer
tain that SNAP (the Stanford
New Afterschool Program), will
be filled to capacity when it
opens next fall. Currently many
childcare problems require in
dividual solutions, such as skip
ping classes when a child is ill or
leaving children unattended in
order to go to class, use reserve
materials at the library and
punch keys at the computer
center.
Stanford residents are ineligi

ble for Palo Alto city childcare
programs. Other licensed cen
ters and daycare homes are gen
erally full and at a sufficient dis
tance from campus that they
pose a serious transportation
problem. Individual babysitters
are also of varying quality and
reliability.
The current costs of services,
even where they exist, are not
insubstantial. Childcare center
fees range from a minimum of
$75 to well over $100 per month
per child. Babysitters are also
expensive. As a group, student
parents have severely limited fi
nancial resources, especially
since childcare costs are not pre

sently included in the basic Uni
versity financial aid package.
This year the Santa Clara County
Child Care Pilot Study has sub
sidized many Stanford families,
but unfortunately the subsidies
are scheduled to end in June.
Official University policy on
childcare has been stated in a
memorandum prefacing the
Childcare Policy Study — Stan
ford 1972 by Aimee Dorr Leifer.
The guiding principle is one of
minimal University involve
ment in childcare, which means
no commitment of major re
sources in terms of land or fund
ing. This statement also assigns
primary responsibility for

"facilitating workable childcare
arrangements" to the Dean of
Student Affairs Office. The pol
icy does allow for childcare re
ferral services and a childcare
consultant position, although
the funding remains very li
mited for these efforts.
Committee set
In response to childcare
needs, a student-sponsored
Committee on Childcare was es
tablished last year to propose and
actively pursue solutions. This
committee's efforts have re
sulted in the planned construc
tion of a facility to house the
SNAP afterschool program and a
morning infant-care program.

In our opinion childcare op
portunities for students, staff
and faculty remain inadequate.
Both Stanford University and
the families involved suffer as a
result. Therefore, we make the
following suggestions:
(1) The collection, compilation
and distribution of demographic
statistics within the entire Stan
ford community. A few ques
tions posed annually on student
registration forms would suffice
to indicate some of the potential
demand for childcare. At the
very minimum, marital status
and the number and ages of de
pendents should be ascertained.
(2)Formal recognition by the
University of childcare as a need
within the Stanford community.

icy does allow for childcare re
ferral services and a childcare
consultant position, although
the funding remains very li
mited for these efforts.
Committee set
In response to childcare
needs, a student-sponsored
Committee on Childcare was es
tablished last year to propose and
actively pursue solutions. This
committee's efforts have re
sulted in the planned construc
tion of a facility to house the
SNAP afterschool program and a
morning infant-care program.

In our opinion childcare op
portunities for students, staff
and faculty remain inadequate.
Both Stanford University and
the families involved suffer as a
result. Therefore, we make the
following suggestions:
(1) The collection, compilation
and distribution of demographic
statistics within the entire Stan
ford community. A few ques
tions posed annually on student
registration forms would suffice
to indicate some of the potential
demand for childcare. At the
very minimum, marital status
and the number and ages of de
pendents should be ascertained.
(2)Formal recognition by the
University of childcare as a need
within the Stanford community.
Currently, childcare (as both a
problem and a service) is viewed
as existing "at" Stanford. In this,
as in other aspects, the families
of Stanford students and per
sonnel must become legitimate
members "of" Stanford.
(3) Serious attention to the fi
nancial burden of childcare.
On-campus centers provide scho
larships whenever possible, but
these resources are slim.
Child-related costs also should be
considered in the granting of fi
nancial aid.
(4) Adequate funding of the
childcare consultant position.
This is an indispensable ad
ministrative position concerned
with childcare issues. Since the
childcare consultant's services
are utilized by faculty and staff
as well as students, funds pro
vided by the Dean of Student Af
fairs Office for the consultant
position should be
supplemented by monies from
faculty and staff sources.
(5) Reevaluation of official
childcare policy. A revised pol
icy that goes beyond facilitation
should be established, which
would encourage responsible
commitment of University re
sources to childcare service.

Student education and scho
larly research are the accepted
goals of Stanford University. In
our opinion, the accomplish
ment of these goals is hindered
by a lack of adequate childcare
services. The problem is perva
sive in that it affects all segments
of the Stanford community — fa
culty, staff and students.
Recent and accurate data on
the need for childcare services is
unavailable. There are over 2000
married students, many of
whom are parents.
Students have a need for reli
able, convenient, inexpensive
childcare. Students with
families, mostly graduates, not
only attend classes and conduct
research, they also must provide
the emotional and financial es
sentials to their children. With
out adequate childcare services,
the student's ability to take full
advantage of Stanford's educa
tional offerings is greatly re
duced.
Childcare available
Faculty and staff face parallel
problems. The availability of
childcare services can be a factor
in Stanford's continued ability
to attract high-quality faculty
and staff. Although there may be
an overabundance of employ
able Ph.Ds, administrators and
support staff, the brightest
young professionals and the ab
lest personnel usually have job
opportunities at several univer
sities. Provision of care for their
children is one factor that could
influence their ultimate deci
sion.
Current and planned oncam
pus childcare programs do not
meet the need for such services.
Existing facilities generally have
long waiting lists. It is almost cer
tain that SNAP (the Stanford
New Afterschool Program), will
be filled to capacity when it
opens next fall. Currently many
childcare problems require in
dividual solutions, such as skip
ping classes when a child is ill or
leaving children unattended in
order to go to class, use reserve
materials at the library and
punch keys at the computer
center.
Stanford residents are ineligi

ble for Palo Alto city childcare
programs. Other licensed cen
ters and daycare homes are gen
erally full and at a sufficient dis
tance from campus that they
pose a serious transportation
problem. Individual babysitters
are also of varying quality and
reliability.
The current costs of services,
even where they exist, are not
insubstantial. Childcare center
fees range from a minimum of
$75 to well over $100 per month
per child. Babysitters are also
expensive. As a group, student
parents have severely limited fi
nancial resources, especially
since childcare costs are not pre

sently included in the basic Uni
versity financial aid package.
This year the Santa Clara County
Child Care Pilot Study has sub
sidized many Stanford families,
but unfortunately the subsidies
are scheduled to end in June.
Official University policy on
childcare has been stated in a
memorandum prefacing the
Childcare Policy Study — Stan
ford 1972 by Aimee Dorr Leifer.
The guiding principle is one of
minimal University involve
ment in childcare, which means
no commitment of major re
sources in terms of land or fund
ing. This statement also assigns
primary responsibility for

"facilitating workable childcare
arrangements" to the Dean of
Student Affairs Office. The pol
icy does allow for childcare re
ferral services and a childcare
consultant position, although
the funding remains very li
mited for these efforts.
