# Progress will be gradual
## Cancer cure still far away 
### Bill Snyder 
"There will not be a dramatic cure
for cancer at least in the near future,"
said Dr. Saul Rosenberg last night in
the third of a series of lectures on
cancer at the Medical Center's Sher
man Fairchild Auditorium.
"Instead there will be gradual ad
vances, disease by disease, year by
year, for some of the cancers of man,"
he said.
Rosenberg, chief of the division of
oncology, and Dr. Sarah Donaldson,
assistant professor of radiology, spoke
before 250 people about the compara
tive efficacies of cancer treatments
such as chemotherapy, radiation
therapy and surgery.
According to Rosenberg,
chemotherapy has great potential in
fighting cancer. In the last 30 years 30
to 40 drugs have been accepted as
cancer fighting agents in the United
States, he said.
No beneficial effect
However, he did not believe that the
controversial drug Laetrile, which is
gaining acceptance among physicians
and legislators, had any beneficial ef
fect in curing cancer.
"I believe that it's a worthless prop
osed treatment and it shouldn't be
used," he said. "My greatest fear is that
it is used instead of effective treat
ment."
The advantage of chemotherapy,
said Rosenberg, is that it is "useful no
matter where the cancer cells may be."

In addition to chemotherapy, new
developments are being made in radia
tion therapy here to improve cancer
treatment, said Donaldson.
Implantation
One of these is interstitial implanta
tion, "Tissue implantations ofneedles,
seeds, of wires containing radioactive
isotopes," said Donaldson. Implanta
tion gives a higher dose of radiation to
a very localized area with fewer com
plications than traditional therapy,
she said.
This method may provide an alter
native to surgery in the treatment of
breast cancer, she said. It cures 100 per
cent of breast cancers caught in the
early stages, and 64 per cent of ad

vanced cases. The results, she said, are
"making us challenge the traditional
radical mastectomy."
The pion generator, developed here,
may provide an alternative to x-ray
therapy, said Donaldson.
Pions, or pi negative mesons are
heavy nuclear particles intermediate
in mass between protons and neut
rons. Generated by the splitting of
atoms by an electron beam, these par
ticles are directed into the cancerous
tissue by magnets. Once captured by
the nucleus of a cancer cell, the parti
cle's excess energy causes disintegra
tion of the nucleus and the cell, result
ing in a "star formation."


Cancer awareness
Dr. Saul Rosenberg, chief of the division of oncology,
and Dr. Sarah Donaldson, assistant professor of radiol
ogy, discussed different forms of cancer treatment such
