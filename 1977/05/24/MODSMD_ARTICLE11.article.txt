# Bonzo comes to Stanford

Stanford students were most
dubiously honored by the guest
appearance this month of former
governor of California, Hoover
Institute honorary fellow and
true-bred, full-to-the-brim con
servative, Ronald Reagan. A
somewhat mistaken euphoria
filled Bishop Auditorium that
night, and so my pen feels com
pelled to straighten out the po
tential misconceptions that
Reagan may have aroused.
I have my doubts about the
qualifications this second-rate
actor from the era of Bonzo Goes
to College and Death Valley
Days has for political comment.
However, after spending 90 mi
nutes listening to Reagan, I am
sure of one thing — eight years of
being governor and three years
of presidential aspirations have
transformed Reagan into a first
rate actor-politician.
"But hold on," you say. "This
is political blasphemy. Isn't
Ronald Reagan that great gover
nor of California who would
have defeated Jimmy Carter in
November if given the
chance. . .7"
Not so, I must respond. Having
lived in California, attended
California public schools, read
California newspapers and
hopelessly watched the degrada
tion of the poor, the elderly, the
young and the mentally ill dur
ing those eight long years of his
governorship, I know full well
what kind of man this is.
Sitting in Bishop Auditorium I
tried desperately to keep an open
mind as Reagan began his disser
tation. His opening speech was
harmless enough but as soon as
he started to answer the first
question from the audience, the
charade began and all at once the
two-faced politician was upon

us. And thus begins our story.
When asked about President
Jimmy Carter's stand on human
rights, Reagan called the policy
"hypocritical," citing the U.S.
intention to normalize relations
with Cuba and Vietnam.
Reagan further told the audi
ence, "I don't even like the fact
that we now call them Vietnam.
I'm still calling it North Viet
nam. It is the conqueror of South
Vietnam."
It is a fact that Article 1 and
Article 14, section (a) of the
Geneva Accords (July 20, 1954)
along with paragraph seven of
the Geneva Conference Declara
tion (July 21,19754) clearly state
that the demarcation line bet
ween northern and southern
Vietnam was "provisional and
should not in any way be inter
preted as constituting a political
territory."
Twisting statistics
Reagan used statistics, often
times bent to his advantage, to
prove many of his arguments.
Governor Reagan told Stan
ford students that the federal
government spends $288 billion
a year on programs "roughly"
directed toward those 13.5 mill
ion people living below the pov
erty line.
There are 25 million people
living below the poverty line.
The federal government spends
$177.5 billion a year in transfer
payments of which only $28.1
billion is directly aimed toward
the poor. Reagan's figure in
cludes state and federal farm and
housing subsidies, veterans' be
nefits, railroad retirement, un
employment insurance, social
security payments,ad infinitum.
All of these programs are not
directed only toward the poor
but rather end up largely as in

come transfers among the mid
dle class.
California record
The major area of conflict bet
ween Ronald Reagan's rhetoric
and reality arose when consider
ing his ovvn record as governor
of California.
Reagan said, "We gave the
biggest percentage increase in
support of public education
that's ever been given in the his
tory of the state."
However, within the first
month of his administration,
Reagan proposed a 29 per cent
cut in state funding for the Uni
versity of California and a 28 per
cent cut in state college funding.
Reagan pushed through his
proposal to establish the first tui
tion charges in the history of the
University of California making
it impossible for thousands of
qualified students to attend in
stitutions of higher learning.
Reagan's argument was that
tuition charges would discour
age "undesirables" from attend
ing such institutions as UC-
Berkeley, saying. "Those there
might think twice before they
pay tutiion."
Mental health
Reagan said that the California
State Mental Health Department
was recognized throughout the
world for its excellence.
This may be so, but no thanks
to Reagan's actions. In 1967
Reagan proposed to cut the state
mental health care budget ny
$17.7 million and demanded re
duction of employes by 3700.
Special projects, such as the
state's only alcoholism treat
ment center in Mendocino, were
eliminated. Fourteen psychiat
ric clinics were shut down and
thousands of patients were
forced to leave the state institu-

tions. As a result of these and
other actions, the mentally ill
and mentally handicapped were
denied adequate facilities,
treatment and care.
Welfare
As governor of California he
vetoed more federal anti-poverty
grants than any governor in the
United States. He cut back funds
and programs for low-cost hous
ing, job-training, job placement
and assistance to ghetto schools.
As a constant critic of the federal
"War on Poverty" he countered
it with his own war on welfare by
reducing welfare budgets and at
tempting to discard the Medi-
Cal program.
Reagan justifies all these and
other steps taken against educa
tion, health and welfare by say
ing that they were moves to
"economize." This too is a fal
lacy when seen in light of the
fact that as governor he doubled
the costs of his personal staff and
built an extravagant governor's
mansion while continuing to
give increased tax breaks to oil
companies.
However, Reagan has been
able to hide such facts from the
public with a facade of simplis
tic, politically vague statements.
As far as the legitimacy of
Ronald Reagan's political out
look and the character of the
man, perhaps the KZSU disc
jockey best summed up my feel
ings when he concluded the
broadcast of Reagan's speech
here by saying the program was
finished and that he could offer
no opinion, just music — the
music most appropriately rang
out the words of John Lennon:
"He's a real nowhere man. . . ."

Stanford students were most
dubiously honored by the guest
appearance this month of former
governor of California, Hoover
Institute honorary fellow and
true-bred, full-to-the-brim con
servative, Ronald Reagan. A
somewhat mistaken euphoria
filled Bishop Auditorium that
night, and so my pen feels com
pelled to straighten out the po
tential misconceptions that
Reagan may have aroused.
I have my doubts about the
qualifications this second-rate
actor from the era of Bonzo Goes
to College and Death Valley
Days has for political comment.
However, after spending 90 mi
nutes listening to Reagan, I am
sure of one thing — eight years of
being governor and three years
of presidential aspirations have
transformed Reagan into a first
rate actor-politician.
"But hold on," you say. "This
is political blasphemy. Isn't
Ronald Reagan that great gover
nor of California who would
have defeated Jimmy Carter in
November if given the
chance. . .7"
Not so, I must respond. Having
lived in California, attended
California public schools, read
California newspapers and
hopelessly watched the degrada
tion of the poor, the elderly, the
young and the mentally ill dur
ing those eight long years of his
governorship, I know full well
what kind of man this is.
Sitting in Bishop Auditorium I
tried desperately to keep an open
mind as Reagan began his disser
tation. His opening speech was
harmless enough but as soon as
he started to answer the first
question from the audience, the
charade began and all at once the
two-faced politician was upon

us. And thus begins our story.
When asked about President
Jimmy Carter's stand on human
rights, Reagan called the policy
"hypocritical," citing the U.S.
intention to normalize relations
with Cuba and Vietnam.
Reagan further told the audi
ence, "I don't even like the fact
that we now call them Vietnam.
I'm still calling it North Viet
nam. It is the conqueror of South
Vietnam."
It is a fact that Article 1 and
Article 14, section (a) of the
Geneva Accords (July 20, 1954)
along with paragraph seven of
the Geneva Conference Declara
tion (July 21,19754) clearly state
that the demarcation line bet
ween northern and southern
Vietnam was "provisional and
should not in any way be inter
preted as constituting a political
territory."
Twisting statistics
Reagan used statistics, often
times bent to his advantage, to
prove many of his arguments.
Governor Reagan told Stan
ford students that the federal
government spends $288 billion
a year on programs "roughly"
directed toward those 13.5 mill
ion people living below the pov
erty line.
There are 25 million people
living below the poverty line.
The federal government spends
$177.5 billion a year in transfer
payments of which only $28.1
billion is directly aimed toward
the poor. Reagan's figure in
cludes state and federal farm and
housing subsidies, veterans' be
nefits, railroad retirement, un
employment insurance, social
security payments,ad infinitum.
All of these programs are not
directed only toward the poor
but rather end up largely as in

come transfers among the mid
dle class.
California record
The major area of conflict bet
ween Ronald Reagan's rhetoric
and reality arose when consider
ing his ovvn record as governor
of California.
Reagan said, "We gave the
biggest percentage increase in
support of public education
that's ever been given in the his
tory of the state."
However, within the first
month of his administration,
Reagan proposed a 29 per cent
cut in state funding for the Uni
versity of California and a 28 per
cent cut in state college funding.
Reagan pushed through his
proposal to establish the first tui
tion charges in the history of the
University of California making
it impossible for thousands of
qualified students to attend in
stitutions of higher learning.
Reagan's argument was that
tuition charges would discour
age "undesirables" from attend
ing such institutions as UC-
Berkeley, saying. "Those there
might think twice before they
pay tutiion."
Mental health
Reagan said that the California
State Mental Health Department
was recognized throughout the
world for its excellence.
This may be so, but no thanks
to Reagan's actions. In 1967
Reagan proposed to cut the state
mental health care budget ny
$17.7 million and demanded re
duction of employes by 3700.
Special projects, such as the
state's only alcoholism treat
ment center in Mendocino, were
eliminated. Fourteen psychiat
ric clinics were shut down and
thousands of patients were
forced to leave the state institu-

tions. As a result of these and
other actions, the mentally ill
and mentally handicapped were
denied adequate facilities,
treatment and care.
Welfare
As governor of California he
vetoed more federal anti-poverty
grants than any governor in the
United States. He cut back funds
and programs for low-cost hous
ing, job-training, job placement
and assistance to ghetto schools.
As a constant critic of the federal
"War on Poverty" he countered
it with his own war on welfare by
reducing welfare budgets and at
tempting to discard the Medi-
Cal program.
Reagan justifies all these and
other steps taken against educa
tion, health and welfare by say
ing that they were moves to
"economize." This too is a fal
lacy when seen in light of the
fact that as governor he doubled
the costs of his personal staff and
built an extravagant governor's
mansion while continuing to
give increased tax breaks to oil
companies.
However, Reagan has been
able to hide such facts from the
public with a facade of simplis
tic, politically vague statements.
As far as the legitimacy of
Ronald Reagan's political out
look and the character of the
man, perhaps the KZSU disc
jockey best summed up my feel
ings when he concluded the
broadcast of Reagan's speech
here by saying the program was
finished and that he could offer
no opinion, just music — the
music most appropriately rang
out the words of John Lennon:
"He's a real nowhere man. . . ."

Stanford students were most
dubiously honored by the guest
appearance this month of former
governor of California, Hoover
Institute honorary fellow and
true-bred, full-to-the-brim con
servative, Ronald Reagan. A
somewhat mistaken euphoria
filled Bishop Auditorium that
night, and so my pen feels com
pelled to straighten out the po
tential misconceptions that
Reagan may have aroused.
I have my doubts about the
qualifications this second-rate
actor from the era of Bonzo Goes
to College and Death Valley
Days has for political comment.
However, after spending 90 mi
nutes listening to Reagan, I am
sure of one thing — eight years of
being governor and three years
of presidential aspirations have
transformed Reagan into a first
rate actor-politician.
"But hold on," you say. "This
is political blasphemy. Isn't
Ronald Reagan that great gover
nor of California who would
have defeated Jimmy Carter in
November if given the
chance. . .7"
Not so, I must respond. Having
lived in California, attended
California public schools, read
California newspapers and
hopelessly watched the degrada
tion of the poor, the elderly, the
young and the mentally ill dur
ing those eight long years of his
governorship, I know full well
what kind of man this is.
Sitting in Bishop Auditorium I
tried desperately to keep an open
mind as Reagan began his disser
tation. His opening speech was
harmless enough but as soon as
he started to answer the first
question from the audience, the
charade began and all at once the
two-faced politician was upon

us. And thus begins our story.
When asked about President
Jimmy Carter's stand on human
rights, Reagan called the policy
"hypocritical," citing the U.S.
intention to normalize relations
with Cuba and Vietnam.
Reagan further told the audi
ence, "I don't even like the fact
that we now call them Vietnam.
I'm still calling it North Viet
nam. It is the conqueror of South
Vietnam."
It is a fact that Article 1 and
Article 14, section (a) of the
Geneva Accords (July 20, 1954)
along with paragraph seven of
the Geneva Conference Declara
tion (July 21,19754) clearly state
that the demarcation line bet
ween northern and southern
Vietnam was "provisional and
should not in any way be inter
preted as constituting a political
territory."
Twisting statistics
Reagan used statistics, often
times bent to his advantage, to
prove many of his arguments.
Governor Reagan told Stan
ford students that the federal
government spends $288 billion
a year on programs "roughly"
directed toward those 13.5 mill
ion people living below the pov
erty line.
There are 25 million people
living below the poverty line.
The federal government spends
$177.5 billion a year in transfer
payments of which only $28.1
billion is directly aimed toward
the poor. Reagan's figure in
cludes state and federal farm and
housing subsidies, veterans' be
nefits, railroad retirement, un
employment insurance, social
security payments,ad infinitum.
All of these programs are not
directed only toward the poor
but rather end up largely as in

come transfers among the mid
dle class.
California record
The major area of conflict bet
ween Ronald Reagan's rhetoric
and reality arose when consider
ing his ovvn record as governor
of California.
Reagan said, "We gave the
biggest percentage increase in
support of public education
that's ever been given in the his
tory of the state."
However, within the first
month of his administration,
Reagan proposed a 29 per cent
cut in state funding for the Uni
versity of California and a 28 per
cent cut in state college funding.
Reagan pushed through his
proposal to establish the first tui
tion charges in the history of the
University of California making
it impossible for thousands of
qualified students to attend in
stitutions of higher learning.
Reagan's argument was that
tuition charges would discour
age "undesirables" from attend
ing such institutions as UC-
Berkeley, saying. "Those there
might think twice before they
pay tutiion."
Mental health
Reagan said that the California
State Mental Health Department
was recognized throughout the
world for its excellence.
This may be so, but no thanks
to Reagan's actions. In 1967
Reagan proposed to cut the state
mental health care budget ny
$17.7 million and demanded re
duction of employes by 3700.
Special projects, such as the
state's only alcoholism treat
ment center in Mendocino, were
eliminated. Fourteen psychiat
ric clinics were shut down and
thousands of patients were
forced to leave the state institu-

tions. As a result of these and
other actions, the mentally ill
and mentally handicapped were
denied adequate facilities,
treatment and care.
Welfare
As governor of California he
vetoed more federal anti-poverty
grants than any governor in the
United States. He cut back funds
and programs for low-cost hous
ing, job-training, job placement
and assistance to ghetto schools.
As a constant critic of the federal
"War on Poverty" he countered
it with his own war on welfare by
reducing welfare budgets and at
tempting to discard the Medi-
Cal program.
Reagan justifies all these and
other steps taken against educa
tion, health and welfare by say
ing that they were moves to
"economize." This too is a fal
lacy when seen in light of the
fact that as governor he doubled
the costs of his personal staff and
built an extravagant governor's
mansion while continuing to
give increased tax breaks to oil
companies.
However, Reagan has been
able to hide such facts from the
public with a facade of simplis
