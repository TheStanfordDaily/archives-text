# KZSU: hard work, no thanks
##

Wayne Miller

First, let me say that it's cer
tainly no fun to have to defend
the KZSU Noon Concerts after
all the work that I and others
have put into it. Especially after
some unfeeling person at the
Hoover Institution (Daily, May
13) let his opinions be known.
Still, people ought to know the
facts; so, grudgingly, here is the
other side.
The real meat-and-potatoes of
the matter comes down to one
simple point. We're not "wast
ing" anybody's money. In an ef
fort which we figured would
make everyone happy, we offer
local bands—usually new
talent—hour performance op
portunities.
However, these are simple
publicity events —no payment
ever changes hands. We do pay a
few people to make the whole
thing audible, and allow us to
broadcast the proceedings in
stereo for the stay-at-homes.
We'd be doing this even if we
sponsored nighttime parties, as
the May 3 letter suggested we
start.
We also pay this newspaper
and a student artist for their ef
forts in bringing our noontime
activities to the student body's
attention.
Next, the specifics. What
about this May 3 concert de
scribed as "noise pollution" by
Joe Leggette? After setting up
through the proper channels —
use of White Plaza for that date,
after "Shaky Ground" agreed to
appear on that day, after insur
ing that the proper equipment
was available, I received a call
over the weekend from the
SCIRE people. In effect, they had
decided to use the plaza on May

3 and asked us to cancel or move.
Cancelling out would have
meant lost money (and re
member, we're trying to use our
money wisely). It was a hassle,
but fine. The band performed
from Tresidder's back patio.
Get it? We were doing some
one a favor!
The acoustics behind the
cafeteria are the pits, I grant you.
There, sound has nowhere to go,
with essentially four walls to box
amplified frequencies in the
patio area. Still, as Leggette him
self pointed out, there were at
least 75 people listening and en
joying the music, including my
self. "Shaky Ground" was not a
"two-bit band." They've ap
peared in several nightclubs; in
addition, they opened a stint in
San Francisco recently. In other
words, Leggette has a minority
opinion about this group.
So basically, I and other KZSU
staffers are pissed by the un
necessary letter. In more relev
ant terms: say you've really put
in the time on a 20-page paper.
You typed until your Smith-
Corona burnt out, then switched
to the dependable Royal manual.
Finishing the job. you rush to
class and proudly present to the
professor your work. He flips
through it, slaps you in the face,
and says "You dare switch type
faces?" Now, how do you feel?
You feel like shit.
That's how we feel.
Which brings me to another
idea. If Leggette nurtures un
happy thoughts about the KZSU
concerts, why run to the Daily?
Wouldn't justice be served better
by his telling me —the organizer
of this effort—his ideas and
suggestions?

Really isn't Daily letter writ
ing a rather stupid alternative in
this case?
Further, I wonder if, for all the
time and energy spent in the
planning and execution of con
cert events, Leggette is the only
thanks we get this year. For all
the John Kaplan lectures re
broadcast, for the Reagan and
Bradbury speeches that you

heard at the dorms, for all the
ASSU Seriate meetings aired, for
all the Saturday Jazz presented
and yes, for all the frigging noon
concerts, in return KZSU re
ceives a brisk slap in the face.
From all us kids at the New
Zoo FM—thanks, people. Shall
we turn the other cheek, now?

Finishing the job. you rush to
class and proudly present to the
professor your work. He flips
through it, slaps you in the face,
and says "You dare switch type
faces?" Now, how do you feel?
You feel like shit.
That's how we feel.
Which brings me to another
idea. If Leggette nurtures un
happy thoughts about the KZSU
concerts, why run to the Daily?
Wouldn't justice be served better
by his telling me —the organizer
of this effort—his ideas and
suggestions?

Really isn't Daily letter writ
ing a rather stupid alternative in
this case?
Further, I wonder if, for all the
time and energy spent in the
planning and execution of con
cert events, Leggette is the only
thanks we get this year. For all
the John Kaplan lectures re
broadcast, for the Reagan and
Bradbury speeches that you

heard at the dorms, for all the
ASSU Seriate meetings aired, for
all the Saturday Jazz presented
and yes, for all the frigging noon
concerts, in return KZSU re
ceives a brisk slap in the face.
From all us kids at the New
Zoo FM—thanks, people. Shall
we turn the other cheek, now?

First, let me say that it's cer
tainly no fun to have to defend
the KZSU Noon Concerts after
all the work that I and others
have put into it. Especially after
some unfeeling person at the
Hoover Institution (Daily, May
13) let his opinions be known.
Still, people ought to know the
facts; so, grudgingly, here is the
other side.
The real meat-and-potatoes of
the matter comes down to one
simple point. We're not "wast
ing" anybody's money. In an ef
fort which we figured would
make everyone happy, we offer
local bands—usually new
talent—hour performance op
portunities.
However, these are simple
publicity events —no payment
ever changes hands. We do pay a
few people to make the whole
thing audible, and allow us to
broadcast the proceedings in
stereo for the stay-at-homes.
We'd be doing this even if we
sponsored nighttime parties, as
the May 3 letter suggested we
start.
We also pay this newspaper
and a student artist for their ef
forts in bringing our noontime
activities to the student body's
attention.
Next, the specifics. What
about this May 3 concert de
scribed as "noise pollution" by
Joe Leggette? After setting up
through the proper channels —
use of White Plaza for that date,
after "Shaky Ground" agreed to
appear on that day, after insur
ing that the proper equipment
was available, I received a call
over the weekend from the
SCIRE people. In effect, they had
decided to use the plaza on May

3 and asked us to cancel or move.
Cancelling out would have
meant lost money (and re
member, we're trying to use our
money wisely). It was a hassle,
but fine. The band performed
from Tresidder's back patio.
Get it? We were doing some
one a favor!
The acoustics behind the
cafeteria are the pits, I grant you.
There, sound has nowhere to go,
with essentially four walls to box
amplified frequencies in the
patio area. Still, as Leggette him
self pointed out, there were at
least 75 people listening and en
joying the music, including my
self. "Shaky Ground" was not a
"two-bit band." They've ap
peared in several nightclubs; in
addition, they opened a stint in
San Francisco recently. In other
words, Leggette has a minority
opinion about this group.
So basically, I and other KZSU
staffers are pissed by the un
necessary letter. In more relev
ant terms: say you've really put
in the time on a 20-page paper.
You typed until your Smith-
Corona burnt out, then switched
to the dependable Royal manual.
Finishing the job. you rush to
class and proudly present to the
professor your work. He flips
through it, slaps you in the face,
and says "You dare switch type
faces?" Now, how do you feel?
You feel like shit.
