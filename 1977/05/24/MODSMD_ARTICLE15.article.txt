# ICC blasts interstate movers
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” American
families who use moving com
panies to carry their possessions
to homes in other states are over
charged $20 million a year be
cause of fraudulent practices by
some companies, the Interstate
Commerce Commission (ICC)
said yesterday.
ICC Chairman Dan O'Neal,
who announced a crackdown on
such practices, said many mov
ing families lose more than $500
per trip because of "rip-off"
practices aimed at making the
customer pay for a heavier load
than he actually shipped.
O'Neal said some movers have
been caught adding bricks, steel
ingots, old engine parts, packing

crates and even people to trailers
and vans to make the load
heavier and the bill higher.
The ICC also said it is going
after phony agricultural
cooperatives which use the
cooperative label to avoid rate,
weight and safety regulations.
Some of these truckers have been
caught running narcotics, the
ICC said.
At a news conference, O'Neal
screened a film made by under
cover agents in Santa Clara,
showing workers staggering
under the weight of iron and
steel bars as they were loaded
onto trucks about to be weighed.
The film also showed fork lift
trucks placing huge pallets of

bricks and other objects too large
to be lifted by hand onto trucks
for weighing along with the
household goods that were
being shipped by the pound.
O'Neal said unscrupulous
truckers weigh their vehicles,
load them with the goods to be
moved, then add other weight at
warehouses or terminals. Then
the whole load is weighed. This
gross weight, less the weight of
the truck, is the weight the cus
tomer pays for, but the extra
weights are removed before the
trucker actually makes his trip.
The ICC regulates the rates
charged by interstate shippers
and the biggest consideration is
weight.
