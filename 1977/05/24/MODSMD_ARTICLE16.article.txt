## Jazz/john nielsen Singer Tom Waits: a genius buried in his image 
### 
Tom Waits looks like a man in
the final stages of terminal dip
somania. He is sunken-eyed,
pale, and twitchy when lighting a
cigarette. He is always lighting a
cigarette.
On stage Waits is continually
staggering about, never seeming
to be entirely in control of his
body. When excited, his arms
stab nervously at the air and his
feet set up a rhythm which is re
stless and convulsed.
His voice, once almost a good
one, is now no more than low
pitched gutteral noise, reminis
cent of a hungover Louis
Armstrong. Even his piano
work, oddly consistent and pre
cise, is too simple and familiar to
attract much attention.
Why, then, is Tom Waits be
coming so popular? What does
he do to turn songs with titles
like "Pasties and a G-string" and
"The Piano Has Been Drinking
(Not Me)" into classics? How did
this man get from the bowels of
metropolitan Los Angeles to a
position coveted by every other
two-in-the-morning bar-room
musician in the country?
No teeth
Some will insist that Waits'
success is a function of his repu
tation as the archetypal
English-speaking derelict. This
position has some merit. After
all, it is true that Waits has a ten
dency to appear on album covers
with a beer or six, and he would
be the first to note his aversion to
"Purina checkerboard slacks"
and "Foster Grant wrap

arounds."
More than once he has expres
sed a favorable opinion of such
evil topics as alcoholism ("I'd
rather have a bottle in front of me
than a frontal lobotomy") or kin
kiness ("what I need right now is
12 hours of sleep, some 12-
year-old Scotch and a 12-year
old girl").
It is not true, however, that
Waits is successful simply be
cause he represents the worth
less slob residing in every man's
heart of hearts. He is more than a
face-down-drunk.
The proof is in his lyrics,
which are blisteringly funny, de
liberately loose and usually foul.
Prolonged association with a
reasonably audible Waits will
convince even the most skepti
cal of the fertility of his mind.
Waits is essentially an orator
masquerading as a slob. His two
greatest strengths are an ability
to exhume and revive seemingly
long-dead phrases and a knack
for illustrating the stupidity of
many live ones.
Bonemeal
To hear the first technique, lis
ten to "Tom Trabert's Lament."
The chorus is nothing less than
the Australian national anthem
and the verses are movie cliches,
but the combination is moving
and fresh.
For an idea of how the other
approach works, try "Step Right
Up," Waits' tribute to inanity in
advertising. He simply gathers a
great number of vacuous phrases
into one big, vacuous song (be

come the proud owner of a
quality-goes-i n-before-the-name
goes on, without having to worry
about the heartbreak of
psoriasis) and allows it all to fes
ter.
But Waits the artist may very
well die in the absence of Waits
the degenerate and vice versa.
Just the same, it is impossible to
play both rules fully at the same
time and the recent Waits con
cert in Berkeley's Zellerbach
Auditorium was an excellent
example.
'Cud'
At Berkeley the boozer was
dominant, as it was nearly an
hour before Waits began to
worry about such artistic intan
gibles as the audible pronuncia
tion of simple sentences. He was
having a terrific time blowing
smoke rings to the rhythm of the
drummer and it was fun watch
ing him parody himself, but after
a while you began to wonder
what he bad been saying for all

that time.
Luckily, Waits' band—called
"The Nocturnal Emissions" and
consisting of Shelly Manne on
drums, Jim Hugart on bass and
Lew Tabakin on tenor sax—is
composed of excellent musi
cians and they kept things on a
reasonable track.
Even better, Waits himself fi
nally began to tire of the atmos
phere and by the end of the con
cert he had found time to work in
three or four clear lyrical favo
rites.
Although everyone left the
concert congratulating each
other for their decision to attend,
it was hard not to feel « little
cheated. It was an easy victory
for Waits, and it was hard to be
satisfied with such a quick
glimpse of the talent which has
given him his edge. There's a
genius in there somewhere, and
he ought to take some time and
dig it out.

Don Rifkin (left) and Webster Proctor rehearse for the
Ujamaa Player's production of Blues for Mister Charlie. The \
James Baldwin play will be presented tonight, tomorrow and |
Thursday at 7:30 and Sunday at 2 in the Nitery.
Tom Waits looks like a man in
the final stages of terminal dip
somania. He is sunken-eyed,
pale, and twitchy when lighting a
cigarette. He is always lighting a
cigarette.
On stage Waits is continually
staggering about, never seeming
to be entirely in control of his
body. When excited, his arms
stab nervously at the air and his
feet set up a rhythm which is re
stless and convulsed.
His voice, once almost a good
one, is now no more than low
pitched gutteral noise, reminis
cent of a hungover Louis
Armstrong. Even his piano
work, oddly consistent and pre
cise, is too simple and familiar to
attract much attention.
Why, then, is Tom Waits be
coming so popular? What does
he do to turn songs with titles
like "Pasties and a G-string" and
"The Piano Has Been Drinking
(Not Me)" into classics? How did
this man get from the bowels of
metropolitan Los Angeles to a
position coveted by every other
two-in-the-morning bar-room
musician in the country?
No teeth
Some will insist that Waits'
success is a function of his repu
tation as the archetypal
English-speaking derelict. This
position has some merit. After
all, it is true that Waits has a ten
dency to appear on album covers
with a beer or six, and he would
be the first to note his aversion to
"Purina checkerboard slacks"
and "Foster Grant wrap

arounds."
More than once he has expres
sed a favorable opinion of such
evil topics as alcoholism ("I'd
rather have a bottle in front of me
than a frontal lobotomy") or kin
kiness ("what I need right now is
12 hours of sleep, some 12-
year-old Scotch and a 12-year
old girl").
It is not true, however, that
Waits is successful simply be
cause he represents the worth
less slob residing in every man's
heart of hearts. He is more than a
face-down-drunk.
The proof is in his lyrics,
which are blisteringly funny, de
liberately loose and usually foul.
Prolonged association with a
reasonably audible Waits will
convince even the most skepti
cal of the fertility of his mind.
Waits is essentially an orator
masquerading as a slob. His two
greatest strengths are an ability
to exhume and revive seemingly
long-dead phrases and a knack
for illustrating the stupidity of
many live ones.
Bonemeal
To hear the first technique, lis
ten to "Tom Trabert's Lament."
The chorus is nothing less than
the Australian national anthem
and the verses are movie cliches,
but the combination is moving
and fresh.
For an idea of how the other
approach works, try "Step Right
Up," Waits' tribute to inanity in
advertising. He simply gathers a
great number of vacuous phrases
into one big, vacuous song (be

come the proud owner of a
quality-goes-i n-before-the-name
goes on, without having to worry
about the heartbreak of
psoriasis) and allows it all to fes
ter.
But Waits the artist may very
well die in the absence of Waits
the degenerate and vice versa.
Just the same, it is impossible to
play both rules fully at the same
time and the recent Waits con
cert in Berkeley's Zellerbach
Auditorium was an excellent
example.
'Cud'
At Berkeley the boozer was
dominant, as it was nearly an
hour before Waits began to
worry about such artistic intan
gibles as the audible pronuncia
tion of simple sentences. He was
having a terrific time blowing
smoke rings to the rhythm of the
drummer and it was fun watch
ing him parody himself, but after
a while you began to wonder
what he bad been saying for all

that time.
Luckily, Waits' band—called
"The Nocturnal Emissions" and
consisting of Shelly Manne on
drums, Jim Hugart on bass and
Lew Tabakin on tenor sax—is
composed of excellent musi
cians and they kept things on a
reasonable track.
Even better, Waits himself fi
nally began to tire of the atmos
phere and by the end of the con
cert he had found time to work in
three or four clear lyrical favo
rites.
Although everyone left the
concert congratulating each
other for their decision to attend,
it was hard not to feel « little
cheated. It was an easy victory
for Waits, and it was hard to be
satisfied with such a quick
glimpse of the talent which has
given him his edge. There's a
genius in there somewhere, and
he ought to take some time and
dig it out.

Tom Waits looks like a man in
the final stages of terminal dip
somania. He is sunken-eyed,
pale, and twitchy when lighting a
cigarette. He is always lighting a
cigarette.
On stage Waits is continually
staggering about, never seeming
to be entirely in control of his
body. When excited, his arms
stab nervously at the air and his
feet set up a rhythm which is re
stless and convulsed.
His voice, once almost a good
one, is now no more than low
pitched gutteral noise, reminis
cent of a hungover Louis
Armstrong. Even his piano
work, oddly consistent and pre
cise, is too simple and familiar to
attract much attention.
Why, then, is Tom Waits be
coming so popular? What does
he do to turn songs with titles
like "Pasties and a G-string" and
"The Piano Has Been Drinking
(Not Me)" into classics? How did
this man get from the bowels of
metropolitan Los Angeles to a
position coveted by every other
two-in-the-morning bar-room
musician in the country?
No teeth
Some will insist that Waits'
success is a function of his repu
tation as the archetypal
English-speaking derelict. This
position has some merit. After
all, it is true that Waits has a ten
dency to appear on album covers
with a beer or six, and he would
be the first to note his aversion to
"Purina checkerboard slacks"
and "Foster Grant wrap

arounds."
More than once he has expres
sed a favorable opinion of such
evil topics as alcoholism ("I'd
rather have a bottle in front of me
than a frontal lobotomy") or kin
kiness ("what I need right now is
12 hours of sleep, some 12-
year-old Scotch and a 12-year
old girl").
It is not true, however, that
Waits is successful simply be
cause he represents the worth
less slob residing in every man's
heart of hearts. He is more than a
face-down-drunk.
The proof is in his lyrics,
which are blisteringly funny, de
liberately loose and usually foul.
Prolonged association with a
reasonably audible Waits will
convince even the most skepti
cal of the fertility of his mind.
Waits is essentially an orator
masquerading as a slob. His two
greatest strengths are an ability
to exhume and revive seemingly
long-dead phrases and a knack
for illustrating the stupidity of
many live ones.
Bonemeal
To hear the first technique, lis
ten to "Tom Trabert's Lament."
The chorus is nothing less than
the Australian national anthem
and the verses are movie cliches,
but the combination is moving
and fresh.
For an idea of how the other
approach works, try "Step Right
Up," Waits' tribute to inanity in
advertising. He simply gathers a
great number of vacuous phrases
into one big, vacuous song (be

come the proud owner of a
quality-goes-i n-before-the-name
goes on, without having to worry
about the heartbreak of
psoriasis) and allows it all to fes
ter.
But Waits the artist may very
well die in the absence of Waits
the degenerate and vice versa.
Just the same, it is impossible to
play both rules fully at the same
time and the recent Waits con
cert in Berkeley's Zellerbach
Auditorium was an excellent
example.
'Cud'
At Berkeley the boozer was
dominant, as it was nearly an
hour before Waits began to
worry about such artistic intan
gibles as the audible pronuncia
tion of simple sentences. He was
having a terrific time blowing
smoke rings to the rhythm of the
drummer and it was fun watch
ing him parody himself, but after
a while you began to wonder
what he bad been saying for all

that time.
Luckily, Waits' band—called
"The Nocturnal Emissions" and
consisting of Shelly Manne on
drums, Jim Hugart on bass and
Lew Tabakin on tenor sax—is
composed of excellent musi
cians and they kept things on a
reasonable track.
Even better, Waits himself fi
nally began to tire of the atmos
phere and by the end of the con
cert he had found time to work in
three or four clear lyrical favo
rites.
Although everyone left the
concert congratulating each
other for their decision to attend,
it was hard not to feel « little
cheated. It was an easy victory
for Waits, and it was hard to be
satisfied with such a quick
glimpse of the talent which has
given him his edge. There's a
genius in there somewhere, and
he ought to take some time and
dig it out.
