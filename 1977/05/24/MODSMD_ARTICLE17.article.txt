## S.F. Ballet presents rich mosaic 
### 
The current program of the
San Francisco E3allet is a mosaic
which is rich and refreshing in
color. The variety in the quartet
of dances created an evening
which was never stuffy, never
stabbed with yawns, but instead
greatly satisfying. The program
opened with a light piece, fol
lowed by a solemn one, a drama,
and ended with a comedy.
Three of the dances were
choreographed within the com
pany, and all but Sinfonia, a re
vival from 1959 by company
co-director Lew Christensen,
were world premieres. Scherzo
was choreographed by artistic
co-director Michael Smuin, and

Peter and the Wolf by company
principal danseur Jerome Weiss.
Three, choreographed espe
cially for ballerina Linda Meyer,
was a work by the
internationally-known John Bu
tler.
In Sinfonia, Christensen's in
terpretation of the abstract music
of Bocchirini became loose, de
bonair, unrestricted dancing.
Throughout, it carried a buoyant
mood, sprinkled with humor
and charged with vitality. The
ballerinas wore simple pink
tights and blue tank leotards, the
men pale blue shirts. The
choreography included many
pirouettes, arabesques and airy

grand jetes. The third movement
received much applause. Its mo
tions were less frivolous than
those of the other movements,
more fluid, growing from one
motion into the next, with much
physical contact and interaction
between the dancers. Betsy
Erickson on legs and toes which
illustrated long, sleek lines and
effortless extension epitomized
the art of dance. She never temp
ted me to pray for the salvation of
a badly executed pirouette or
arabesque, dancing with preci
sion, yet breezily and lilting like
a freely flying bird.
Death
Scherzo began lively and fes
tive, but progressed, with the en
trance of Death (Michael Dwyer)
and a Female Apparition (Ally
son Deane), to a finish which left
a sense of foreboding. The
choreography in this dance,
mostly powerful and vigorous,
was very effective in conveying
the chill of death. Scherzo was a
profound piece, not exactly
pleasant, but impressive. Diana
Weber and Dennis Marshall as
one of the couples captured my
eye throughout with their
energy and exhiliarating accu
racy in performing some dif
ficult lifts and jumps.
More a mime than a ballet,
Three embraced movements
which were at times lithe and
liquid, but more often struggl
ing, strict and emphasized. The
only scenery consisted of huge,
shiny-grey tubes twisted and
looped about each other, giving
the effect of monstrous sausages.
The dancers deserved congratu
lations for their concentration
and belief in their characters, in
whom they thoroughly im
mersed themselves.
Again Dennis Marshall stood
out with his dynamic, yet grace
ful dancing; his was an innocent
pas de deux with Linda Meyer

while Vane Vest was more sen
sual in his pas de deux. Meyer
was so acute and clean in her
movements, she seemed to
dance as if in a deep trance, the
movements coming from an
inner source.
Adam and Eve
A tension, almost a feeling of
pulling, straining, of opposing
forces within the motions, per
meated this dramatization of the
story of Adam and Eve. The in
tense interaction between
characters, each maneuver pre
gnant with symbolism, stimu
lated the mind. 1 he dance ended
exactly as it began: Linda
crouching beneath the mass of
grey tubes, her back turned to
ward us; hei posture hunched;
her person stripped of sex and
identity. Unfurling her arm, she
reached up to pick the apple of
knowledge.
The last piece in the mosaic
was a one-act comedy with
dance steps thrown in. Although
strikingly funny in some places,
much of the humor was over
done and repetitive. Toward the
end it became tedious, the laugh
ter coming in limp spurts. This
satire on Peter and the Wolf was
too shiny-bright in its attempt at
absurdity and was saved only by
very convincing impersonations
of the Marx Brothers by the stage
hands and the sparkle and en
thusiasm of the dancer-actors
who were genuinely having fun
on stage. The piece was a take-off
on the flesh trade with Peter
(Michael Graham) as a naive,
rather effeminate boy-scout, and
the Cat (Madeleine Bouchard)
and the Bird (Allyson Deane) as
hustlers who finally bestowed
manhood on Peter. The Wolf
(Gary Wahl), in a flashy jumpsuit
was, of course, a pimp. The cos
tuming was perfectly tailored to
each character, adding much
amusement to the show.
