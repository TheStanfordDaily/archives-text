## Pacific Ballet not exciting 
### 
The Pacific Ballet Company has three directors, one of whom is
alumnus John Pasquatelli. After his graduation, Pasquatelli retreated
to a monastery, choreographed a mime dance version of Tommy,
and, in 1973, assumed directorship of the Pacific Ballet.
While at Stanford he had produced a version of Alice in Wonder
land set in a hospital ward and a rock version of A Midsummer
Night's Dream. His most recent work, Danpe and Dancers, premiered
at the Pacific Ballet's season opening May 12. It is as innovative as
his previous work.
Pasquatelli decided to expose the exciting, esoteric world of dan
cers in rehearsal and class in a dance-drama. Against a sound collage
of music and dancers voicing their thoughts, and in a colorful as
sortment of practice clothes, dancers go through floor exercises,
gossip, rehearse, injure themselves and perform part of The Rite of
Spring.
Hearing dancers discuss their diets and watching them clown
around is good for a few laughs, but it's not worth 13 scenes. The
result is not so much stereotype as boredom.
Centrality
The other two directors, Sue Loyd and Henry Berg, have each
danced with both the San Francisco and Joffrey Ballet Companies
and have worked with a variety of choreographers. Sue Loyd
choreographed Kentron in 1976 to the third movement of Prokofiev's

Piano Sonata No. 8.
Basic ballet technique requires that dancers
have a centrality of force from which the move
ments of their limbs can emanate. In Dance and
Dancers, this centrality was not called into ques
tion, but inKentron, the dancers perform oniy with
their legs and their facial expressions and their
arm carriage seem still, superimposed and pre
tentious. They act as if someone had told them to
perform like wind-up ballerinas.
Part of the problem is the size of Marine's Memo
rial Theatre; from the orchestra (which is alsmost
the entire lower floor) the dancers look pressed
against the wall, and, in such an intimate space,
unnatural grandeur without absorption makes the
classical choreography seem dry.
Leviathans
Voice of The Whaie, another Pasquatelli work,
describes the beginnings of human consciousness
to a score of conch shells being blown and other
unearthly noises. The dancers wear whale-like
silver body-suits, but the artistic purpose of pointe
shoes was unclear; pointework's ethereal quality
has nothing to do with cave life.
The choreography is modern in style and
suggests crouching, slithering rituals. Toward the
end the dancers stand and face the audience in a
semicircle of innocent yet awesome vulnerability.
Throughout the piece, however, the dancers did
not convey the inherent quality of any of the
movements. A contraction did not choke, a stretrh
did not pull its limb out of the socket and with no
dynamics of breath and control Voice of the Whale
was so primeval that it seemed dead.

suggests crouching, slithering rituals. Toward the
end the dancers stand and face the audience in a
semicircle of innocent yet awesome vulnerability.
Throughout the piece, however, the dancers did
not convey the inherent quality of any of the
movements. A contraction did not choke, a stretrh
did not pull its limb out of the socket and with no
dynamics of breath and control Voice of the Whale
was so primeval that it seemed dead.

An end in itself
Pacific Ballet Company dancers perform in Dance and Dancers,
a work which shows dancers in all phases of rehearsal.
The Pacific Ballet Company has three directors, one of whom is
alumnus John Pasquatelli. After his graduation, Pasquatelli retreated
to a monastery, choreographed a mime dance version of Tommy,
and, in 1973, assumed directorship of the Pacific Ballet.
While at Stanford he had produced a version of Alice in Wonder
land set in a hospital ward and a rock version of A Midsummer
Night's Dream. His most recent work, Danpe and Dancers, premiered
at the Pacific Ballet's season opening May 12. It is as innovative as
his previous work.
Pasquatelli decided to expose the exciting, esoteric world of dan
cers in rehearsal and class in a dance-drama. Against a sound collage
of music and dancers voicing their thoughts, and in a colorful as
sortment of practice clothes, dancers go through floor exercises,
gossip, rehearse, injure themselves and perform part of The Rite of
Spring.
Hearing dancers discuss their diets and watching them clown
around is good for a few laughs, but it's not worth 13 scenes. The
result is not so much stereotype as boredom.
Centrality
The other two directors, Sue Loyd and Henry Berg, have each
danced with both the San Francisco and Joffrey Ballet Companies
and have worked with a variety of choreographers. Sue Loyd
choreographed Kentron in 1976 to the third movement of Prokofiev's

Piano Sonata No. 8.
Basic ballet technique requires that dancers
have a centrality of force from which the move
ments of their limbs can emanate. In Dance and
Dancers, this centrality was not called into ques
tion, but inKentron, the dancers perform oniy with
their legs and their facial expressions and their
arm carriage seem still, superimposed and pre
tentious. They act as if someone had told them to
perform like wind-up ballerinas.
Part of the problem is the size of Marine's Memo
rial Theatre; from the orchestra (which is alsmost
the entire lower floor) the dancers look pressed
against the wall, and, in such an intimate space,
unnatural grandeur without absorption makes the
classical choreography seem dry.
Leviathans
Voice of The Whaie, another Pasquatelli work,
describes the beginnings of human consciousness
to a score of conch shells being blown and other
unearthly noises. The dancers wear whale-like
silver body-suits, but the artistic purpose of pointe
shoes was unclear; pointework's ethereal quality
has nothing to do with cave life.
The choreography is modern in style and
suggests crouching, slithering rituals. Toward the
end the dancers stand and face the audience in a
semicircle of innocent yet awesome vulnerability.
Throughout the piece, however, the dancers did
not convey the inherent quality of any of the
movements. A contraction did not choke, a stretrh
