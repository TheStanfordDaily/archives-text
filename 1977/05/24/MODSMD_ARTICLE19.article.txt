# Dance class to give sampler
## 
### 
t Representing a wide range of styles, themes
| and moods,' Dance Sampler; A Choreography
; Class Performance is a collage of a dozen
! pieces choreographed by class members and
; performed by dance students here. It will be
! performed Friday and Saturday evenings at
; 8:30 in the Roble Gym large studio. Admission
; is free.
; Under the direction of Carol Soleau, Dance
!; Sampler emerges as "a "small example of the
ji many different processes attempted in the
class." These processes, improvisation, work
jl ing with musicians and even making a film
i; have sought to stimulate creativity in the form
I; of dance.
Soleau has encouraged students to "make
;j individual statements through their dances,

trying to let their works come from them
selves." The result is that each piece repre
sents a different style and approach, using a
variety of means to convey its theme.
Because each choreographer also performs
in other class member's pieces, there is a sen
sitivity and awareness of the dancers as indi
viduals which adds a rare quality to the
pieces, forming a close bond between theme
and execution. The themes range from the
light-hearted antics of clowns to struggles for
freedom and identity.
Lighting design and execution is by the
drama department lighting class under Michael
Ramsaur. Musicians performing original
works as accompaniment include Herb Moore
and Rob Fruchtman.
