# Efforts underway to improve teaching

### Cindy Curbo News analysis 
How do students here feel about the
quality of their education?
Student dissatisfaction with courses
and instruction has greatly increased
in the past few years, according to a
recent report of the University om
budsman. And a 1976 survey of stu
dent attitudes found that the percen
tage of students who said they were
"very well satisfied" with their educa
tional experience here had dropped
from 38 per cent in 1961 to 24 per cent
in 1976 —a statistically significant

trend.
In an attempt to resolve this prob
lem, the recent ASSU Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality made
five recommendations which it be
lieved would improve the quality of
teaching here. The first of those re
commendations, calling for mandat
ory evaluation of all courses, was
unanimously approved by the Faculty
Senate on May 12.
More recognition
In agreement with members' belief
that "people shape their performance
according to the structure of rewards

they perceive," the task force has
suggested that teaching be given more
visible and tangible recognitions than
in the past so that professors will be
encouraged to devote more time to it.
All of the recommendations of the
task force are efforts to change the
University's tenure and promotions
reward structure, which seems to be
heavily weighted in favor of research
over teaching.
An increased emphasis on teaching
quality is not unique to the University.
In fact, it may be nationwide.
In a 1975 New York Times article,
two Fordham University scholars con
cluded from a study of 500 liberal arts
colleges that "a quiet change is taking
place on college campuses: faculty are
being held accountable, as never be
fore, in how well they serve students
and there is a marked shift in the way
faculty are being evaluated."
Identifying some of the causes be
hind this change, the article said, "the
emphasis on student evaluation of pro
fessors fits into the current buyer's
market in education. Colleges, caught

in the economic squeeze, can no
longer afford to ignore the customer
who can take his or her tuition
elsewhere.
Reaction
"It is widely believed as well that the
trend is a reaction to the rebellions of
the 1960s when administrators were
pressured to involve students more in
the running of the college.
"Thus, private colleges are demand
ing more and more of their professors.
It is not just a matter of production but
of teaching effectiveness."
Mandatory course evaluation,
perhaps the most important of the task
force recommendations, is a specific
example of a measure intended to in
crease the overall importance of teach
ing in the University reward structure.
In reviewing a professor's file, the
report stated, tenure and promotions
committees often are presented with
"voluminous documentation" of his
past research, including lists of pub
lished material and letters ranking him
relative to other scholars, but with "re
latively meagre documentation of
teaching."
Evaluation summaries
Accordingly, the task force recom
mended that summaries of the course
evaluation data be included in each
faculty member's personnel or promo
tion folder. By providing more sys
tematic, thorough and objective data
than has been provided in the past,
task force members hoped that more
consideration would be given to teach
ing in tenure and promotions deci
sions.
The report stated that there appears
to be a relationship between the degree
to which teaching is systematically
evaluated by students and the balance
between the teaching and research
criteria.
The Graduate School of Business,
for example, which has the most
thorough program of student evalua
tion, strives for a balance between re
search and teaching and achieves a
ratio of about 60/40, according to As
soc. Business School Dean Robert
Jaedicke.

"It is widely believed as well that the

the running of the college.
"Thus, private colleges are demand

Mandatory course evaluation,
perhaps the most important of the task
force recommendations, is a specific

ing in the University reward structure.
In reviewing a professor's file, the
report stated, tenure and promotions
committees often are presented with
"voluminous documentation" of his
past research, including lists of pub

relative to other scholars, but with "re
latively meagre documentation of
teaching."
Evaluation summaries
Accordingly, the task force recom
mended that summaries of the course
evaluation data be included in each
faculty member's personnel or promo
tion folder. By providing more sys
tematic, thorough and objective data
than has been provided in the past,
task force members hoped that more
consideration would be given to teach

The report stated that there appears
to be a relationship between the degree
to which teaching is systematically
evaluated by students and the balance
between the teaching and research
criteria.
The Graduate School of Business,
for example, which has the most
thorough program of student evalua
tion, strives for a balance between re
search and teaching and achieves a
ratio of about 60/40, according to As
soc. Business School Dean Robert
Jaedicke.
How do students here feel about the
quality of their education?
Student dissatisfaction with courses
and instruction has greatly increased
in the past few years, according to a
recent report of the University om
budsman. And a 1976 survey of stu
dent attitudes found that the percen
tage of students who said they were
"very well satisfied" with their educa
tional experience here had dropped
from 38 per cent in 1961 to 24 per cent
in 1976 —a statistically significant

trend.
In an attempt to resolve this prob
lem, the recent ASSU Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality made
five recommendations which it be
lieved would improve the quality of
teaching here. The first of those re
commendations, calling for mandat
ory evaluation of all courses, was
unanimously approved by the Faculty
Senate on May 12.
More recognition
In agreement with members' belief
that "people shape their performance
according to the structure of rewards

they perceive," the task force has
suggested that teaching be given more
visible and tangible recognitions than
in the past so that professors will be
encouraged to devote more time to it.
All of the recommendations of the
task force are efforts to change the
University's tenure and promotions
reward structure, which seems to be
heavily weighted in favor of research
over teaching.
An increased emphasis on teaching
quality is not unique to the University.
In fact, it may be nationwide.
In a 1975 New York Times article,
two Fordham University scholars con
cluded from a study of 500 liberal arts
colleges that "a quiet change is taking
place on college campuses: faculty are
being held accountable, as never be
fore, in how well they serve students
and there is a marked shift in the way
faculty are being evaluated."
