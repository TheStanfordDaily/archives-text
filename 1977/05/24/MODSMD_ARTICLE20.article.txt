## Ozawa gambles and wins with Wagner 
### 
Seiji Ozawa is a gambler. Last
week, in his penultimate ap
pearance as music director of the
San Francisco Symphony,
Ozawa bucked the odds by pre
senting Act I of Richard
Wagner's Die WaJkure.
Wagner's difficult score not
only pushes an orchestra to the
limits of their ability, but de
mands three versatile vocalists.
Also, the San Francisco Opera
staged the complete opera last
year with two international
superstars in the cast: Jon Vic
kers and Leonie Rysanek. Hence,
many in the audience had re
cently seen the best — and on
stage. Despite all this, Ozawa's
program was a winner.

Soprano Jesseye Norman was
the star of the evening. Her
sonorous and emotional voice —
tempered by close attention to
the often subtle nuances of Sieg
linde's character — combined
with her vibrant stage presence
to allow the audience to forget
the lack of sets and costumes.
Saving her most powerful deliv
ery for the final climax, Norman
exhibited sensitive musician
ship and realized the overall
dramatic and musical shape of
the act.
Unlikely Twins
Tenor Peter Hoffman, Sieg
mund, was a poor match for
Norman. Vocally and tempera

mentally (as well as physically),
they were unlikely twins.
Hoffman, making his American
debut, sang in a style more
suited to early Wagnerian heros
— Lohengrin or Tannhauser —
than the mature and seasoned
Siegmund. Although Hoffman's
voice was fresh and clear with
near-perfect intonation, his in
terpretation was emotionally
one-dimensional, lacking in
both depth and dramatic range.
One could not picture the years
of woe, nor imagine him falling
into a springtime ecstasy on find
ing his true-love. Although some
may have preferred the thinner
tone quality of Hoffman to Nor

man's rich timbre, Hoffman's in
ability to capture the character of
Siegmund and the mismatch
with Norman were unfortunate.
Metropolitan Opera bass Paul
Plishka, seen in the Verdi Re
quiem this spring, was a convinc
ingly evil Hunding: striding por
tentously on stage in mid-act,
glancing suspiciously at Sieg
mund as he commented on the
sibling's similarity, and then
leaving the lovers alone. His
deep bass ranged from suspici
ous interest to bitter anger.
The orchestral interpretation
was questionable. Although
they never outstepped reasona
ble bounds, Ozawa's tempos
failed to create an overall struc
ture to the act, leaving the audi
ence with an insight more rhap
sodic than climactic. Also, the
performance was hampered by
Ozawa's characteristic lack of
rhythmic clarity, less noticeable
than in his Mozart interpreta
tions, but equally detrimental.
Despite these problems, the per
formance radiated the energy
and excitement which always
highlight an evening with
Ozawa on the podium.
Tuba motifs
The orchestra — obviously en
joying themselves — responded
with excellent solo playing. Act I
of Die WaJkure portrays hunters
and hunted whose triumphs are

recorded in horn and "Wagner
tuba" motifs. The symphony
horn section, notoriously in
competent, surpassed them
selves in a clean set of solos.
Vahalla (trombone motif) was
profoundly magnificent and the
sword (trumpets) glimmered in
the firelight. The tight wood
wind harmonies were smooth
and romantic, the cellos solos
lovingly warm.
The orchestra as a whole suf
fered occasional lapses of con
centration: the horns slipped
when not exposed, the wood
winds were sometimes too loud,
and the strings lukewarm. But
these were scratches on the sur
face of one of the most inspired
symphony performances of the
year. Ozawa's energy and Nor
man's feeling brought the
packed house to its feet in an in
stant standing ovation which far
outlasted any other this season.
The enthusiastic response of
an-audience which filled the
house reasserts what the San
Francisco Opera has known for
years: the first love of San Fran
cisco audiences is opera.
(Next week Ozawa will gamble
again with his final concert as
San Francisco Symphony Music
Director: Mahler's Symphony
No. 2 "Resurrection Sym
phony" with soloists Susan
Wyner and Maureen Forrester.)

one-dimensional, lacking in
both depth and dramatic range.
One could not picture the years
of woe, nor imagine him falling
into a springtime ecstasy on find
ing his true-love. Although some
may have preferred the thinner
tone quality of Hoffman to Nor

man's rich timbre, Hoffman's in
ability to capture the character of
Siegmund and the mismatch
with Norman were unfortunate.
Metropolitan Opera bass Paul
Plishka, seen in the Verdi Re
quiem this spring, was a convinc
ingly evil Hunding: striding por
tentously on stage in mid-act,
glancing suspiciously at Sieg
mund as he commented on the
sibling's similarity, and then
leaving the lovers alone. His
deep bass ranged from suspici
ous interest to bitter anger.
The orchestral interpretation
was questionable. Although
they never outstepped reasona
ble bounds, Ozawa's tempos
failed to create an overall struc
ture to the act, leaving the audi
ence with an insight more rhap
sodic than climactic. Also, the
performance was hampered by
Ozawa's characteristic lack of
rhythmic clarity, less noticeable
than in his Mozart interpreta
tions, but equally detrimental.
Despite these problems, the per
formance radiated the energy
and excitement which always
highlight an evening with
Ozawa on the podium.
Tuba motifs
The orchestra — obviously en
joying themselves — responded
with excellent solo playing. Act I
of Die WaJkure portrays hunters
and hunted whose triumphs are

recorded in horn and "Wagner
tuba" motifs. The symphony
horn section, notoriously in
competent, surpassed them
selves in a clean set of solos.
Vahalla (trombone motif) was
profoundly magnificent and the
sword (trumpets) glimmered in
the firelight. The tight wood
wind harmonies were smooth
and romantic, the cellos solos
lovingly warm.
The orchestra as a whole suf
fered occasional lapses of con
centration: the horns slipped
when not exposed, the wood
winds were sometimes too loud,
and the strings lukewarm. But
these were scratches on the sur
face of one of the most inspired
symphony performances of the
year. Ozawa's energy and Nor
man's feeling brought the
packed house to its feet in an in
stant standing ovation which far
outlasted any other this season.
The enthusiastic response of
an-audience which filled the
house reasserts what the San
Francisco Opera has known for
years: the first love of San Fran
cisco audiences is opera.
(Next week Ozawa will gamble
again with his final concert as
San Francisco Symphony Music
Director: Mahler's Symphony
No. 2 "Resurrection Sym
phony" with soloists Susan
Wyner and Maureen Forrester.)
Seiji Ozawa is a gambler. Last
week, in his penultimate ap
pearance as music director of the
San Francisco Symphony,
Ozawa bucked the odds by pre
senting Act I of Richard
Wagner's Die WaJkure.
Wagner's difficult score not
only pushes an orchestra to the
limits of their ability, but de
mands three versatile vocalists.
Also, the San Francisco Opera
staged the complete opera last
year with two international
superstars in the cast: Jon Vic
kers and Leonie Rysanek. Hence,
many in the audience had re
cently seen the best — and on
stage. Despite all this, Ozawa's
program was a winner.

Soprano Jesseye Norman was
the star of the evening. Her
sonorous and emotional voice —
tempered by close attention to
the often subtle nuances of Sieg
linde's character — combined
with her vibrant stage presence
to allow the audience to forget
the lack of sets and costumes.
Saving her most powerful deliv
ery for the final climax, Norman
exhibited sensitive musician
ship and realized the overall
dramatic and musical shape of
the act.
Unlikely Twins
Tenor Peter Hoffman, Sieg
mund, was a poor match for
Norman. Vocally and tempera

mentally (as well as physically),
they were unlikely twins.
Hoffman, making his American
debut, sang in a style more
suited to early Wagnerian heros
— Lohengrin or Tannhauser —
than the mature and seasoned
Siegmund. Although Hoffman's
voice was fresh and clear with
near-perfect intonation, his in
terpretation was emotionally
one-dimensional, lacking in
both depth and dramatic range.
One could not picture the years
of woe, nor imagine him falling
into a springtime ecstasy on find
ing his true-love. Although some
may have preferred the thinner
tone quality of Hoffman to Nor

man's rich timbre, Hoffman's in
