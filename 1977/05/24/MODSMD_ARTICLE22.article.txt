Carter defends ecology action
Washington — In a special message to Con
gress, President Jimmy Carter insisted yesterday
that the nation can take strong action to protect
the environment without endangering the
economy.
Carter showed no inclination to back down
from the nation's existing air and water quality
goals in the face of industry complaints that they
are too costly and may hamper economic and
energy production.
Environmental measures "like energy conser
vation, reclamation of stripmined lands and re
habilitation of our cities" will produce new jobs,
he said.
Carter's new action included:
—Executive orders for federal agencies to re-,
fuse support for development projects in floodp
lains or wetlands unless there is no practical al
ternative.
—An executive order to close selected public
lands to the use of off-road vehicles such as
snowmobiles and dune buggies where they can
cause serious environmental damage.
—Recommendations to establish five new Na
tional Park Wilderness areas and expand five
others.
—A proposal to terminate authorization of the
Cross Florida Barge Canal, partly constructed
since its authorization in 1942, but halted by
former President Richard Nixon in 1971 because
of its environmental impacts.
—An executive order to restrict imports of
"exotic" plant and animal species into the Un
ited States.
—A directive to the secretaries of commerce
and state to ban whaling within the United
States' 200-mile offshore fishing zone, coupled
with continued U.S. efforts to achieve interna
tional protection of whales.
—Various directives to speed and strengthen
the implementation of existing laws and prog
rams such as toxic substances control.
Terrorists seize Dutch school, train
Assen, The Netherlands — Terrorists seeking
independence for their native Pacific islands
seized a village school and a train yesterday.
Police said the raiders were holding 105 chil
dren, 6 taachers and 50 train passengers hostage.
The double attack by South Moluccan ter
rorists living in Holland was similar to a pair of
actions 18 months ago. It apparently was another
attempt to make the Dutch government help
separate the South Moluccan island chain from
Indonesia, a former Dutch colony that won inde
pendence in 1949.
The assaults came two days before the Dutch
general elections and occurred almost simul
taneously in the farm country outside this small
city in northern Holland. The one-story school is
in a village about 10 miles from the hijacked

passenger train, halted in the countryside
Police said they believed there were six men in
the school and six men and one woman in the
train-raiding band. They said the terrorists were
armed with submachine guns.
The cabinet met in emergency session last
night and Premier Joop den Uyl said later the
elections would be held tomorrow as scheduled.
He said Holland's constitutional process could
not be blocked by "a horrible act of terror."
He also appealed for the nation to show "self
restraint," apparently fearing angry citizens
might react against some of the 40,000 South
Moluccans living in Holland.
The children being held in the school in
Bovensmilde, four miles south of Assen and 110
miles northeast of Amsterdam, were 12 years old
or younger, authorities reported.
Carter signs tax, drought measures
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed
legislation yesterday cutting $5 billion from the
tax bill of low-and middle-income taxpayers and
simplifying the tax filing procedure for nearly
everyone.
He also signed a bill speeding $225 million in
grants and loans to drought-stricken com
munities in the West.
The tax measure, part of the president's stream
lined economic stimulus package, will provide
an over-all $34.1 billion in tax cuts over the next
28 months. Its benefits could be felt as early as
next week when income tax withholding on
paycheckg is reduced, increasing take-home pay.
The bill will cut an average of $2.13 from the
weekly payroll tax withholding of 46 million
people claiming the new standard deduction. It
will eliminate tax payments for 3.3 million low
income families. But 2.2 million single Ameri
cans earning more than $13,750 and claiming the
standard deduction will pay an average of $1
more a week.
The legislation, which is retroactive to the be
ginning of 1977, will make it advantageous for
6.7 million taxpayers who have itemized their
deductions to use the standard deduction. The
deduction will be $3200 for married couples fil
ing joint returns and $2200 for single persons and
heads of households.
The drought legislation is one of several mea
sures designed to relieve the worst effects of the
West's water shortage. The legislation allows the
Commerce Department to make loans and grants
to communities with at least 10,000 residents
that have been hit hardest by the drought. Smal
ler communities are aided by already existing
law.
The money can be used to dig new wells in
smaller cities, repair viaducts and buy and trans
port emergency water supplies "to overcome the
consequences of the drought," Carter said.

NRA plans to battle gun control
Cincinnati — The new leaders of the National
Rifle Association (NRA) plan to cut down con
servation and wildlife programs developed to
quiet critics and will direct the organization's
efforts toward one goal —the battle against gun
control.
Harlon Carter, a past president of the associa
tion and former head of the U.S. Border Patrol,
was elected Sunday to NRA's top paid staff post,
executive vice president.
He replaces Maj. Gen. Maxwell Rich, ousted
along with three other top officers in what Rich
called a "coup" during a marathon weekend ses
sion of the 1.2 million-member NRA's annual
meeting here.
Carter's mandate is to return the organization
to the front line of the battle for preservation of
the "constitutional right to keep and bear arms,"
a cause to which the NRA in the past has dedi
cated a considerable lobbying effort in
Washington.
A coalition of dissidents, the Federation for
NRA, engineered the Carter victory. The dissi
dents, who accused the organization of going soft
on gun control under Rich's direction, urged life
members known to support their position to at
tend the meeting. Only life members are allowed
to vote at annual membership meetings.
"It was a coup," said Rich afterward. "It was
fully orchestrated. They used lists of life mem
bers to get the right ones to come to the meeting
and vote the way they wanted."
Neal Knox, publisher of Handloader and Rifle
magazines and a coalition leader, criticized the
development of NRA's 37,000-acre National
Outdoor Center at Raton, N.M., established for
shooting, hunting and conservation projects, as
detrimental to anti-gun control efforts.
West Germany finds another spy
Bonn, West Germany — West Germany,
Europe's "playground for spies," has produced
another alleged Communist agent—this time the
head of the national detectives federation.
Rolf Grunert, 51, chief inspector for the Ham
burg police department whose federation also
includes West German intelligence agents, is the
latest in a series of prominent Germans involved
in spy scandals.
While Grunert's arrest was being announced
by the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe, a court in
Berlin sentenced the former spokesman for the
Berlin Social Democratic party, Heinrich Burger,
to seven years imprisonment for espionage.
His former wife Kathryn received a IVi-year
term.
The government also announced a sweep for
suspected Communist agents was under way in
northern Germany but refused to give further de
tails. The mass-circulation newspaper Bild said
11 persons had been arrested in the sweep.

Grunert's arrest last weekend attracted atten
tion because of his position, but officials say
nearly 1000 other spies surface every year in
West Germany. There was no estimate of how
many others complete their assignments and are
never caught.
Although the number of spies in West Ger
many may run into thousands, only 51 were ar
rested last year. Thirty-seven others left the coun
try before they could be caught.
Prosecutors are reluctant to bring charges
against small-time spies without a lot of evi
dence. The West German government promises
leniency to spies who turn themselves in.
Woman arrested in cult slaying
Salt Lake City — The wife of an avowed
polygamist has been arrested in the slaying of
naturopathic physician Rulon Allred, a
polygamist cult leader gunned down by two
women in front of horrified patients at his office
earlier this month.
Allred, 71, an excommunicated Mormon, had
received handwritten death threats on pamphlets
printed by a rival polygamist sect, Ervil Leßa
ron's Church of the Lamb of God, the Deseret
News said yesterday.
Allred's sect, which claims several thousand
members in the West but has no name or doctrine
apart from Mormonism, has been peaceful in
contrast to other polygamist sects linked to half a
dozen violent deaths or disappearances in recent
years, police said.
Nacy Chynoweth, 28, of Littleton, Colo., was
arrested in Carrollton, Tex., on Sunday on a
charge of criminal conspiracy in Allred's death.
Police said she waived extradition and would be
returned to Utah in a few days.
Her husband, Victor Chynoweth, told the De
seret News that he is a polygamist and a
"philosophical follower" of Leßaron but is not a
member of the Church of the Lamb of God. He
said he once had two wives, but he did not say if
he now has more than one wife.
He said Nancy Chynoweth was with him when
Allred was shot six times at his office in suburban
Murray on May 10. Investigators say they would
like to talk with Leßaron but have not been able to
find him.
Leßaron, 52, was jailed for a year in Ensenada,
Mexico, after the 1972 shooting death of his
brother, Joel, leader of another polygamist sect,
the Church of the Firstborn of the Fullness of
Times. Ervil Leßaron was convicted of being the
"intellectual head" of the slaying.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy through tomorrow with a
chance of sprinkles. Continued cool. Lows to
night in the upper 40s to low 50s. Highs both
days in the 60s. Chance of measurable rain 20 per
cent today and tonight.
