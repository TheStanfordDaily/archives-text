# Controversial experiments yield insulin production from bacteria
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Controversial experiments in alter
ing genes have resulted in a major breakthrough—scientists
turning ordinary bacteria into factories capable of produc
ing insulin.
Scientists at UC-San Francisco reported yesterday that
within six months they may be able to utilize bacteria col
onies to produce the drug essential to the survival of 1.5
million diabetics.
A research team headed by Doctors Howard Goodman
and William Rutter said it had successfully taken the spe
cial genes that produce insulin out of rats and spliced them
into ordinary bacteria that cannot on their own produce
insulin. The next step is to splice human insulin genes into
the bacteria.
The feat opens the door potentially to further genetic
engineering of splicing, or transfering genes from one
species to another.
Bacteria factories
Bacteria might become factories to make antibiotics or
other drugs. Plants might be given the ability to make nitro
gen out of the air rather than needing expensive and scarce
fertilizers.
Some scientists think this ability to put genes together in
different ways—called recombinant DNA research —would
be a scientific landmark comparable to the atomic age.
The gene is the basic unit of heredity and contains a
chemical, DNA, that tells a cell, for example, whether to
develop into the cell of an eye or the cell of a fingernail. A
specific set of genes in the pancreas orders the production
of insulin, a hormone that helps the body change blood
sugar into energy.
By implanting the right genes into the bacteria colonies,
Goodman said, in six months the scientists may be able to
order the colonies to manufacture a primitive form of the
insulin normally produced in the pancreas of a rat. This
substance then can be transformed into insulin by adding
enzymes in a test tube.
Scarce drugs
The American Diabetic Association estimates that 1.5
million of the nation's 10 million diabetics must take insu
lin drugs to control the disease. The drugs, drawn from pigs
and cattle, are scarce and expensive.
Goodman said he could not estimate when bacteria
produced insulin would be generally available, but said,
"in principle it's all possible and probably could go quite
rapidly."
The UCSF researchers used rat genes because the rat

genes are easily available. But Goodman said it would be a
relatively simple matter for scientists to accomplish the
same results using genes from other mammals.
Because of federal regulations governing the use of re
combinant DNA technology, however, Goodman said re
search leading to the production of human insulin by these
methods was more complicated.
NIH regulations
Regulations imposed by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) on researchers using federal funds require that
human genes, before they can be planted into bacteria, must
be purified in a special facility not readily available to most
scientists.
The regulations grew from fears that this kind of genetic
engineering, planting genes from one species into the cells
of another, could result in a "genetic accident" that would
create a new form of life hazardous to man.
Research on recombinant DNA—deoxyribonucleic
acid—is seen by some scientists as leading to such advances
as controlling hereditary diseases and understanding how
characteristics pass from one generation to the next.
But the NIH guidelines came in response to fears that
uncontrollable and potentially harmful micro-organisms
could escape from the laboratory. Some even fear that gene
tic engineering could one day lead to a dictator bent on
controlling human development.
Voluntary ban
At a 1975 meeting at Asilomar, Calif., 140 biologists ag
reed to impose a voluntary ban on DNA experiments until
safety guidelines could be formed, and a year later the NIH
produced its code.
Bills are pending both in Congress and in the California
legislature to apply the NIH guidelines to all research,
whether federally funded or not.
Goodman said the UCSF findings, to be published in the
journal Science, are the product of more than a year of
studying the genes that produce insulin.
He said the type of bacteria involved in the research could
not live on its own even if it were to escape from the
laboratory.
"We would hope that good things will come of this report
rather than the negative press this type of research has been
getting," Goodman said.
"This kind of research has been going on for five years
and no accidents have been reported. People maybe aie
realizing that the initial fears are not coming to be, and
we're coming close to be able to make something really
biologically important like insulin."

But the NIH guidelines came in response to fears that
uncontrollable and potentially harmful micro-organisms
could escape from the laboratory. Some even fear that gene
tic engineering could one day lead to a dictator bent on
controlling human development.
Voluntary ban
At a 1975 meeting at Asilomar, Calif., 140 biologists ag
reed to impose a voluntary ban on DNA experiments until
safety guidelines could be formed, and a year later the NIH
produced its code.
Bills are pending both in Congress and in the California
legislature to apply the NIH guidelines to all research,
whether federally funded or not.
Goodman said the UCSF findings, to be published in the
journal Science, are the product of more than a year of
studying the genes that produce insulin.
He said the type of bacteria involved in the research could
not live on its own even if it were to escape from the
laboratory.
"We would hope that good things will come of this report
rather than the negative press this type of research has been
getting," Goodman said.
"This kind of research has been going on for five years
and no accidents have been reported. People maybe aie
realizing that the initial fears are not coming to be, and
we're coming close to be able to make something really
biologically important like insulin."
San Francisco (AP) — Controversial experiments in alter
ing genes have resulted in a major breakthrough—scientists
turning ordinary bacteria into factories capable of produc
ing insulin.
Scientists at UC-San Francisco reported yesterday that
within six months they may be able to utilize bacteria col
onies to produce the drug essential to the survival of 1.5
million diabetics.
A research team headed by Doctors Howard Goodman
and William Rutter said it had successfully taken the spe
cial genes that produce insulin out of rats and spliced them
into ordinary bacteria that cannot on their own produce
insulin. The next step is to splice human insulin genes into
the bacteria.
The feat opens the door potentially to further genetic
engineering of splicing, or transfering genes from one
species to another.
Bacteria factories
Bacteria might become factories to make antibiotics or
other drugs. Plants might be given the ability to make nitro
gen out of the air rather than needing expensive and scarce
fertilizers.
Some scientists think this ability to put genes together in
different ways—called recombinant DNA research —would
be a scientific landmark comparable to the atomic age.
The gene is the basic unit of heredity and contains a
chemical, DNA, that tells a cell, for example, whether to
develop into the cell of an eye or the cell of a fingernail. A
specific set of genes in the pancreas orders the production
of insulin, a hormone that helps the body change blood
sugar into energy.
By implanting the right genes into the bacteria colonies,
Goodman said, in six months the scientists may be able to
order the colonies to manufacture a primitive form of the
insulin normally produced in the pancreas of a rat. This
substance then can be transformed into insulin by adding
enzymes in a test tube.
Scarce drugs
The American Diabetic Association estimates that 1.5
million of the nation's 10 million diabetics must take insu
lin drugs to control the disease. The drugs, drawn from pigs
and cattle, are scarce and expensive.
Goodman said he could not estimate when bacteria
produced insulin would be generally available, but said,
"in principle it's all possible and probably could go quite
rapidly."
The UCSF researchers used rat genes because the rat

genes are easily available. But Goodman said it would be a
relatively simple matter for scientists to accomplish the
same results using genes from other mammals.
Because of federal regulations governing the use of re
combinant DNA technology, however, Goodman said re
search leading to the production of human insulin by these
methods was more complicated.
NIH regulations
Regulations imposed by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) on researchers using federal funds require that
human genes, before they can be planted into bacteria, must
be purified in a special facility not readily available to most
scientists.
The regulations grew from fears that this kind of genetic
engineering, planting genes from one species into the cells
of another, could result in a "genetic accident" that would
create a new form of life hazardous to man.
Research on recombinant DNA—deoxyribonucleic
acid—is seen by some scientists as leading to such advances
as controlling hereditary diseases and understanding how
characteristics pass from one generation to the next.
But the NIH guidelines came in response to fears that
uncontrollable and potentially harmful micro-organisms
could escape from the laboratory. Some even fear that gene
