# Prison sentence stands for Mitchell, Haldeman
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme
("ourt virtually cleared the way yester
day for former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
and ex-White House aide H.R. Halde
man to go to prison for their part in the
Watergate cover-up.
The justices, without explanation
and with no recorded disagreements,
refused to hear the appeal of Mitchell,
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman,
another top aide to former President
Richard Nixon.
Ehrlichman has been an inmate at a
federal prison camp in Arizona since
last October. But Mitchell, once the na
tion's top law enforcement official,
and Haldeman have remained free
pending appeal since their convic
tions more than two years ago.
Mitchell, 63, and Haldeman, 50,
could be in prison within a month.
Reconsideration
They have 25 days in which to ask
the court to reconsider the decision
and attorneys for all three men indi
cated that they probably will seek re
consideration.
However, such requests are routine
and the vast majority of them are re
jected. The court usually acts
promptly on such requests.
If no rehearing request is made or if
one is denied, the justices will send the
case back to U.S. District Court Judge
John Sirica, who presided over the
Watergate cover-up trial, for ordering
Mitchell and Haldeman to prison.
The three Watergate defendants
each were sentenced to 30 months to
eight years in prison for conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and giving false
testimony under oath in what pro
secutors said was an attempt to con
ceal government misconduct in the
Watergate scandal.
That scandal, which mushroomed to
involve numerous clandestine opera
tions, began to unfold when seven
burglars were caught trying to bug the
Democratic National Committee's

headquarters in the Watergate office
complex during the 1972 presidential
election.
Conspiracy conviction
Ehrlichman, 51, earlier had been
convicted of conspiracy in connection
with the 1971 "plumbers" burglary of
the office of Daniel Ellsburg's
psychiatrist. He chose to begin serving
his prison terms pending appeal of
both convictions. Both appeals now
have been rejected.
The justices had discussed the
Watergate cover-up case for more than
a month.
Reports surfaced on April 21 that the
court had decided to turn down the

appeal. Chief Justice Warren Burger,
the reports said, was delaying the an
nouncement in hopes of mustering
enough votes to grant review of the
case.
The reports said Burger and fellow
Nixon appointees Harry Blackmun
and Lewis Powell Jr. wanted to review
the case. In such appeals, the votes of
four justices are necessary to grant re
view.
The three men were convicted by a
federal jury on Jan. 1, 1975.
Haldeman had been Nixon's chief of
White House staff. Ehrlichman had
served the Nixon administration as its
top official for domestic policy.

Nixon appointees Harry Blackmun
and Lewis Powell Jr. wanted to review
the case. In such appeals, the votes of
four justices are necessary to grant re
view.
The three men were convicted by a
federal jury on Jan. 1, 1975.
Haldeman had been Nixon's chief of
White House staff. Ehrlichman had
served the Nixon administration as its
top official for domestic policy.
Washington (AP) — The Supreme
("ourt virtually cleared the way yester
day for former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
and ex-White House aide H.R. Halde
man to go to prison for their part in the
Watergate cover-up.
The justices, without explanation
and with no recorded disagreements,
refused to hear the appeal of Mitchell,
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman,
another top aide to former President
Richard Nixon.
Ehrlichman has been an inmate at a
federal prison camp in Arizona since
last October. But Mitchell, once the na
tion's top law enforcement official,
and Haldeman have remained free
pending appeal since their convic
tions more than two years ago.
Mitchell, 63, and Haldeman, 50,
could be in prison within a month.
Reconsideration
They have 25 days in which to ask
the court to reconsider the decision
and attorneys for all three men indi
cated that they probably will seek re
consideration.
However, such requests are routine
and the vast majority of them are re
jected. The court usually acts
promptly on such requests.
If no rehearing request is made or if
one is denied, the justices will send the
case back to U.S. District Court Judge
John Sirica, who presided over the
Watergate cover-up trial, for ordering
Mitchell and Haldeman to prison.
The three Watergate defendants
each were sentenced to 30 months to
eight years in prison for conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and giving false
testimony under oath in what pro
secutors said was an attempt to con
ceal government misconduct in the
Watergate scandal.
That scandal, which mushroomed to
involve numerous clandestine opera
tions, began to unfold when seven
burglars were caught trying to bug the
Democratic National Committee's

headquarters in the Watergate office
complex during the 1972 presidential
election.
Conspiracy conviction
Ehrlichman, 51, earlier had been
convicted of conspiracy in connection
with the 1971 "plumbers" burglary of
the office of Daniel Ellsburg's
psychiatrist. He chose to begin serving
his prison terms pending appeal of
both convictions. Both appeals now
have been rejected.
The justices had discussed the
Watergate cover-up case for more than
a month.
Reports surfaced on April 21 that the
court had decided to turn down the

appeal. Chief Justice Warren Burger,
the reports said, was delaying the an
nouncement in hopes of mustering
enough votes to grant review of the
case.
The reports said Burger and fellow
Nixon appointees Harry Blackmun
and Lewis Powell Jr. wanted to review
the case. In such appeals, the votes of
four justices are necessary to grant re
