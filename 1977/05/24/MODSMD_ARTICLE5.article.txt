## 
### Gary Furlong 
A group of 28 apartheid protesters,
the first to be arraigned, were offered a
plea-bargaining deal yesterday by the
Palo Alto District Attorney's office in
municipal court. Only two have ac
cepted so far.
Under the plea-bargaining "deal,"
the protesters would plead guilty or no
contest to any one of the three mis
demeanor charges that have been filed
against them; in exchange, the other
two charges will be dropped, accord
ing to Dep. Dist. Atty. Tom
Fahrenholz.
"I had talked to the judge before
hand, and 1 was inclined to let them
plead to one (charge), and drop the
other two," he said.
The protesters have been charged
with trespassing with the intention of
obstructing lawful business, refusal to
leave after being told to do so by a

police officer, and remaining at the
scene of an unlawful assembly after
warning to disperse is given.
All three charges are punishable by a
maximum fine of $500 and/or impris
onment in the county jail for up to six
months, according to the California
Penal Code.
This deal is open to all protesters
charged with three misdemeanors,
said Fahrenholz. He said only the per
sons charged with resisting arrest or
persons arrested more than once
would be treated separately.
Protesters Mason M. Funk and
Cinda Gilliand both pleaded no con
test to the charge of "obstructing law
ful business." Both were fined $65 and
placed on six-months probation.
Of the other 26 protesters, 24 asked
for a continuance until sometime next
week, one pleaded not guilty, and one
failed to appear.
One protester, David Cantelme, en
tered a plea of not guilty. He is being
represented by a public defender.
"It's kind of a political statement,"
Cantelme said, "but I don't want to be
convicted of this either. We're trying to
follow by the collective decision (to
plead not guilty)."
According to Chris Coleman, one of
the 24 granted a continuance yester
day, there has been no collective group
decision yet.
"We are still getting the defense to
gether, and deciding what to do," Col
eman said. "Our lawyers are working
on a defense."
In order to deal with the high cost of
legal help, the protesters each decided
to donate $50 to a defense fund.
"We're charging ourselves $50 for
legal fees, and maybe put any leftover
money toward fines," said Bruce
Parker, treasurer for Stanford Commit
tee for Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP). This would be in addition to
the $500 that is in SCRIP coffers now,
he said.
One protester, Edward Harris, did
not appear in court yesterday. If he
does not appear by May 26, a $500
bench warrant will be issued for his
arrest.

Under the plea-bargaining "deal,"
the protesters would plead guilty or no
contest to any one of the three mis
demeanor charges that have been filed
against them; in exchange, the other
two charges will be dropped, accord
ing to Dep. Dist. Atty. Tom
Fahrenholz.
"I had talked to the judge before
hand, and 1 was inclined to let them
plead to one (charge), and drop the
other two," he said.
The protesters have been charged
with trespassing with the intention of
obstructing lawful business, refusal to
leave after being told to do so by a

police officer, and remaining at the
scene of an unlawful assembly after
warning to disperse is given.
All three charges are punishable by a
maximum fine of $500 and/or impris
onment in the county jail for up to six
months, according to the California
Penal Code.
This deal is open to all protesters
charged with three misdemeanors,
said Fahrenholz. He said only the per
sons charged with resisting arrest or
persons arrested more than once
would be treated separately.
Protesters Mason M. Funk and
Cinda Gilliand both pleaded no con
test to the charge of "obstructing law
ful business." Both were fined $65 and
placed on six-months probation.
Of the other 26 protesters, 24 asked
for a continuance until sometime next
week, one pleaded not guilty, and one
failed to appear.
One protester, David Cantelme, en
tered a plea of not guilty. He is being
represented by a public defender.
"It's kind of a political statement,"
Cantelme said, "but I don't want to be
convicted of this either. We're trying to
follow by the collective decision (to
plead not guilty)."
According to Chris Coleman, one of
the 24 granted a continuance yester
day, there has been no collective group
decision yet.
"We are still getting the defense to
gether, and deciding what to do," Col
eman said. "Our lawyers are working
on a defense."
In order to deal with the high cost of
legal help, the protesters each decided
to donate $50 to a defense fund.
"We're charging ourselves $50 for
legal fees, and maybe put any leftover
money toward fines," said Bruce
Parker, treasurer for Stanford Commit
tee for Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP). This would be in addition to
the $500 that is in SCRIP coffers now,
he said.
One protester, Edward Harris, did
not appear in court yesterday. If he
does not appear by May 26, a $500
bench warrant will be issued for his
arrest.
A group of 28 apartheid protesters,
the first to be arraigned, were offered a
plea-bargaining deal yesterday by the
Palo Alto District Attorney's office in
municipal court. Only two have ac
cepted so far.
