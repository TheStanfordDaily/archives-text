# Stanford Daily Opinions
## Integration a problem here 
### 
It being the recent custom of
Daily columnists to deliver sol
iloquies on the occasion of their
final effort, readers understand
ably may have tired of the prac
tice to the point of dispensing
with what follows.
However, because my own
writings have been of record du
ration if nothing else, I cannot
part without finally addressing
an aspect of Stanford that has
bothered me for some time.
If one were actually in a posi
tion to bequeath to this univer
sity some intangible spirit that it
lacks, there might be many pos
sibilities for such a gift: a
genuine tolerance for activities
and institutions that one may
personally abhor; an intellectual
liveliness that spurs students to
challenge professorial pro
nouncements, rather than obe
diently accept them; or a few
campus bars, with enough
good-timers to fill them.
Complaints about all those re
puted Stanford failings aren't
new, and perhaps the University
may be superior to a number of
other places in many of these
qualities. But there is at least one
area in which Stanford doesn't
live up to the promise of a small,
open, liberal community: it is
not very integrated.
There exist lines between ra
cial and ethnic groups that sepa
rate many individuals from each
other and demarcate the cam
pus. These aren't physical or
legal barriers, of course; rather,
they are social preconceptions
which successive classes of stu
dents have brought here and
which the University indirectly
reinforces.
At first thought, Stanford
would seem to be an ideal place
for overcoming many of the
psychological divisions that
exist elsewhere in society. It is a
community of persons selected
on the basis of their own merits
and ability to contribute to
others' growth, a place free of
most of the socio-economic
pressures and fears that are pre
sent on the other side of El
Camino.
And yet outside of first-year
dormitories, it is difficult to
point to any place here where
widespread interaction between

persons of different cultural
backgrounds takes place. Once
classes end each afternoon,
many old patterns reemerge.
Certainly there are
exceptionsâ€”perhaps thousands
of individual ones. But the fact
that they remain exceptions in a
setting as conducive to mixture
as Stanford's speaks poorly of
our chances of ever achieving
true integration in the society
around us.
It would be foolish and self
defeating to try to pre-arrange ar
tificial friendships, of course.
Perhaps the upbringings of per
sons with various cultural

backgrounds tend to direct them
naturally to interact with others
of similar heritage.
Such an inclination, however,
hardly contributes to expanding
one's horizons; to fight it would
be futile, but to encourage it
would be wrong.
How has the University be
come polarized to its current ex
tent? Apparently the large influx
of minority students after 1968
led the way toward members of
various racial and ethnic groups
banding together in search of
group identity and political
power. Many whites also re
treated to their own enclaves.
The University became faced
with a predicament from which
it has yet to extricate itself.
Surely an enlightened institu
tion does not want to stifle the
efforts of individuals to establish
a cultural identity in the way
they see fit. Yet in the process,
these persons may be acting con
trary to what the University sees
as their long-run interest; they
may also be denying their fellow
students exposure to the diver
sity that Stanford promised

them.
The University's response has
been mixed: it has established
residences devoted to various
minority cultures (but which are
half white); it has created special
administrative offices to
ameliorate problems which
reputedly are peculiar to mem
bers of particular minority
groups; and it has provided
forums (orgnaizations, news
papers) for representatives of
various minority communities
to express their views.
The result has been troubling
to some administrators and
others here. The collective voice
they hear from minority rep
resentatives is one of alienation
from "white society" and from
Stanford as a reflection of it.
The most notable response has
been the legendary James Gibbs
memo of two years ago, in which
the then-dean of undergraduate
studies suggested that the Uni
versity ought to seek black stu
dents more attuned to the
"elitist" nature of the institu
tion.
Gibbs* choice of words was
unfortunate for the unintended
public distribution, but the issue
of alienation and its deleterious
impact on a University commun
ity that he raised is the most vex
ing social problem that Stanford
faces today.
I can offer no answer. My pre
diction is for interaction on an
individual basis, but I realize
that the current sentiment
among many minorities is that
individualism is a trait of white
society, while the collective is
the source of their own strength.
To break up the whole into indi
vidual parts is to attempt to as
similate. That's an issue much
greater in scope than integration
here.
In closing, all I can say is this; I
came here from a low socio
economic high school, hoping
that the relaxed atmosphere of
Stanford would make inter
cultural relationships less
strained. In large part I've found
that not true, and I can't say the
fault is entirely my own.
