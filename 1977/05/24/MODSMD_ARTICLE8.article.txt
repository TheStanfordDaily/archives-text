# RA tests: a new game

Life is a series of tests: blood
tests, tests of strength, test runs,
IQ tests, pap tests, and"the fol
lowing is a test, a test of the
Emergency Broadcasting Sys
tem." Even though this plethora
can at times be oppressive,.there
is no denying that test results are
ideal for singling out individu
als from a large group.
For example, doctors, in de
termining whether or not a per
son has veneral disease, have
found that a chemical test is far
more effective than having the
patient nod "yes" or "no." (Al
though at Cowell, a student has
the choice of taking the venereal
disease test or writing a 15-page
paper.)
As students, we are not super
conscious of all the testing that
goes on. A lifetime of academics
has made most of us unaware of
the overwhelming presence of
tests.
What's even worse, these
20-odd years of academic testing
have left many students unpre
pared for the testing that has lit
tle to do with the regurgitation of
knowledge. One need only
spend a day watching the awk
ward miscalculated activities at
a four way traffic stop on campus
to know how badly students can
screw up non-academic tests.
Anyway, testing is on my

mind because of the past week of
school. During this period I un
derwent a series of interviews
required of those who wish to
become house associate (RA) in
University housing. These in
terviews are a form of test in that
the interviewee is given ques
tions that require answers.
And even though there are no
correct answers to many of the
questions, the subtle body lan
guage of the interviewer can give
you the impression that you've
answered a question incorrectly.
For example, I remember giv
ing an answer and having the in
terviewer swab his ears with a
Q-tip and ask me to repeat what
I'd said. One of my group inter
views concluded with the inter
viewer asking me to stay so I
could take out the garbage.
Educational
Nevertheless, these group in
terviews were the most educa
tional because they provided me
with an idea of how fellow stu
dents respond to a non-academic
testing situation.
In these sessions, a question
would be directed at the entire
group and students would take
turns answering it. A few stu
dents felt the need to compete in
giving the best answer and as a
result, the last response was
often very bizarre: such as, "I be-

lieve I'd make a good RA because
I'm a direct descendant of
Moses."
However, the students who
were guilty of overkill in trying
to demonstrate their worthiness
gave unusual answers no matter
where they sat. The following
dialogue took place between an
interviewer and a student who
was maybe a little too desperate
to get the job.
Interviewer: Murray (obvi
ously not his real name), what
activities would you be in
terested in organizing as an RA?
Murray: Excuse me. Before I
answer that, I just caught sight of
your bookshelf and find your lib
rary to be fascinating. How long
have you been into Ward? I
mean, I think he is nothing short
of the greatest author who's ever
lived.
Interviewer: Murray, that's the
binding of a Montgomery Ward
catalogue.
Murray: Oh . . . uh, I've always
thought that they stock the best
merchandise of any mail-order
house. Like this bookshelf of
yours. It looks like something
you could get from Montgomery
Wards. Sturdy, handsome, and I
bet it was real inexpensive.
Interviewer: Murray, it's an
heirloom that's been in my fam
ily since the Hapsburgs.
Murray: You're related to the
Hapsburgs, too?! God, what a
coincidence, so am I. My uncle
even has one of those long thin
noses and a fat lower lip.
Interviewer: Murray, what
about the dorm activities?
Murray: Oh. Well, I would cer
tainly be interested in organiz
ing group mail-order activities
or leading a seminar on the
Hapsburgs. . . .
For me, this incident clearly
demonstrates what constitutes
improper test behavior. How
ever, I'll have to reconsider if I
hear that one of next year's
dorms is making field trips to
Montgomery Ward.
