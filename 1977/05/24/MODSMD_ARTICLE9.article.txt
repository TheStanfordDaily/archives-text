# Clarification
## 
### 
I would like to make a clarification of one of the points I made in
my article on the South Africa rally and sit-in. I stated that before we
sat in and the trustees granted two of our four demands, "the ad
ministration" had "rejected all of them."
What I had in mind here was the generally negative response we
had consistently gotten from the administration on our calls for a
reopening of the issue of the shareholder resolutions and for a meet
ing with the trustees.
It is not, however, accurate to say the administration had actually
rejected our four demands, as the demands were addressed to the
trustees, not to the administration. I regÂ»et any misunderstanding my
statement may have engendered.
