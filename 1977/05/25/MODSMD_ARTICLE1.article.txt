# TMers report extraordinary breakthrough
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
If there is anything more certain than
death and taxes, it is the law of gravity. Our
very existence is based on the belief that
"whatever goes up must come down," that
anything which is dropped will fall to earth,
that objects without support do not float in
the air.
But the law of gravity can no longer be
considered inviolable in light of reports of
"supernormal" abilities among students at
Maharishi European Research University
(MERU).
Not only have advanced practitioners of
transcendental meditation at MERU learned
to levitate themselves, according to MERU
graduate student John Black, but they are
also able to make themselves invisible and
are acquiring general mastery over the fun
damental forces of nature.
Black is in the Bay Area to report on the
"new breakthrough in human potential"
and to outline a series of courses which will
make the phenomena accessible to the gen
eral public. He claims that researchers at
MERU have already started to investigate
the physiological parameters associated
with the techniques.
'Around the world'
"Scientists at MERU and from around the
world have observed the siddhis (the
supernormal phenomena) first-hand," he
said in an interview last week. "But the
most important verification, we feel, is the
individual's own direct experience of in
creased mind-body coordination."
Extensive research performed on
meditators has shown that objective
criteria, such as brain wave coherence as
measured by electro-encephalographs
(EEGs), can be used to give scientific mean
ing to the concept of mind-body, according
to Black.
Scientific investigation is an important
part of the world plan of Maharishi Mahesh

Yogi, he added.
Founder of the TM program, Maharishi is
an heir to the ancient Vedic tradition of
India and the holder of a physics degree
from Allahabad University.
Combining knowledge of ancient texts
with modern ideas of physics, Maharishi
announced in 1958 a plan "to spiritually
regenerate mankind," Black said.
Knowledge unfolded
He started by teaching transcendental
meditation in order to "change society on
the level of the individual," and has un
folded the knowledge of the Vedic tradition
by degrees. The revelation of the siddhis is
one step in the process.
Designated "governors of the Enlighten
ment," graduates of MERU have "returned
to the United States and their respective
countries to introduce this new phase of the
TM program to the public," Black said.
"In Northern California there are two
teams who will begin teaching these Age of
Enlightenment courses this summer," he
continued. "Right now the local governors
are extending an invitation to Bay Area sci
entists to hear about this new program and
to experience it for themselves and to join
the scientists at MERU in the scientific in
vestigation of the growth of conscious
ness."
Black himself will give a lecture on the
work at MERU tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. He will also discuss a
summer Age of Enlightenment course in the
Palo Alto area.
'Required level'
"Since TM is the basis of the performance
of siddhis," he explained, "courses are de
signed to bring the individual to the re
quired level of experience in meditation be
fore introducing the specific instructions
for extending mind-body coordination to
the specific fields of the siddhis."
The TM technique is well-known already,

Black said, as "the mokt effective means of
producing deep rest as a basis for more
dynamic activity, even though it is much
more than that."
Among the scientifically documented
benefits of meditation are improved physi
cal health, academic: performance and ex
tension of athletic abilities, according to
Black. Almost 15 per cent of all major league
hockey players and a slightly smaller per
centage of major league baseball players
practice TM, he said.
On a more macroscopic level, he added,
communities experience a significant drop
in crime and hospital admissions rates

when a critical percentage (about one per
cent) of residents have learned TM.
'Simplest state'
"So it is practical now, and realistic to
talk about creating an ideal society." he
said. "It will be possible soon as individuals
take advantage of the knowledge inherent
in their own consciousness, in the simplest
state of awareness which can be experi
enced universally through the TM
technique."
Although of enormous relevance to mod
ern society, Black said, the basis of TM, the
Vedic tradition, has often been misinter
preted to be a series of "esoteric poems."

"But Maharishi emphasizes that the Veda
is not contained in a set of books," Black
continued. "It is rather the direct cognition
of the laws of nature in their unmanifest
state, just as a tree is contained in a latent
form in a seed.
"They have been preserved on the gross
level and transmitted from generation to
generation in the form of hymns," he added.
In a paper entitled "Enlightenment and
Siddhis," Maharishi explains the relation
ship between the goal of TM, enlightenment
and the laws of nature.
Ability implied
"Enlightenment implies the ability to act
without making mistakes, to be successful
in our undertakings without making prob
lems for ourselves, our community or our
environment," he writes.
"This means that one has the ability to
function without violating the laws of na
ture, to act in such a way that one is always
supported by nature."
Such harmony with nature, the paper
continues, must be derived from"the state
of least excitation of consciousness."
"According to the laws of physics,"
Maharishi writes, "the home of all the laws
of nature is the superfluid vacuum, the
physical state of least excitation. Here all
the constituents and tendencies or laws of
nature are found in an unmanifest yet infi
nitely correlated fashion; it is the source of
all activity, the dynamic field of all pos
sibilities.
'This field'
"According to Hig Veda, this field of all
possibilities is called akshara, the immuta
ble, the state of least excitation of concious
ness.
"Stablization of our ability to function
from this field of all possibilities is called
enlightenment."
Practice of siddhis, in turn, is one aspect
