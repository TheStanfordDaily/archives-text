# Peace, coexistence needed
## 
### 
I read Ahmad Abu El-Haijas series of articles
with interest and with even greater sadness. For
here he is, a bright young man, a graduate student
in electrical engineering, probably destined to be
among the new leaders of your country, and yet he
repeats the same web of lies and half truths, the
same hatred and venom that continue to fuel the
Middle East conflict and prevent peace.
It's a hard thing to admit that both sides have
elements of right and justice, and that both peoples
are in the Middle East to stay. People of good will
could sit down together and come up with a set
tlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. I'm convinced
of that, and I fervently hope it will happen in my
life time. But for that, there must be good will on
both sides.
Israel has demonstrated that kind of good will
time and time again. It has maintained open bor
ders with Jordan to allow trade and repatriation of
families, even though the policy makes it easier for
terrorists to sneak over the border.
Israel has provided a medical clinic on the
Lebanese border to treat that war torn country's
sickand wounded. And in the occupied territories,
despite continuing tension and a major war, Israel
has introduced more democracy than King Hus
sein ever dreamed of.
Where town councils were once appointed by
the government in Amman, they are not elected by
the inhabitants. Unemployment, which under Jor
danian and Egyptian rule, hovered around 30 per
cent, is now around three per cent.
Perhaps most striking are Israel's gestures to
wards the Palestinian Arabs who fled in 1948. Is
rael inherited several hundred thousand of them in
1967 when it occupied the refugee camps in the
Gaza strip. Under Egyptian rule the Palestinians
had been virtual prisoners in these wretched

Dale Pearlman

camps, denied Egyptian citizenship, denied per
mission to leave and resettle elsewhere. While the
Arab states theoretically championed the Palesti
nian cause, in practice they left the Palestinian
people to rot.
Israel gave them employment opportunities and
has been offering government subsidized housing
along with attractive loans to help empty the
camps. And for other Palestinians, Israel has of
fered to negotiate for limited resettlement and re
parations for those who wish to settle elsewhere.
By contrast, the few Jews who remain in Arab
states live in constant terror with onerous legal
restrictions forbidding them most kinds of
employment and any freedom of movement. Arab
governments have offered no reparations to the
700,000 Jews who were forced to flee their lands,
most of whom settled in Israel.
Is it any wonder that Israelis look skeptically at
the Arab "peace overtures" that consist merely of
demands and threats, accompanied by the kind of
poison Abu El-Haija added to in his articles?
Israel has accepted so many peace plans that I've
lost count, while the Arab leadership has yet to
unambiguously renounce its goal of Israel's de
struction. Even the so-called "moderate" wing of
the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) is
forthright about seeing the proposed West Bank
Palestinian state as a springboard for the final as
sault on Tel Aviv.
But I still hope that young Arab leaders like Abu
El-Haija will eventually realize the need for com
promise, so that peace may come at last. If he
begins showing some good will to match Israel's,
then we can all turn away from hate and war and
toward the real business of building, learning to
gether and living in peace.

families, even though the policy makes it easier for
terrorists to sneak over the border.
Israel has provided a medical clinic on the
Lebanese border to treat that war torn country's
sickand wounded. And in the occupied territories,
despite continuing tension and a major war, Israel
has introduced more democracy than King Hus
sein ever dreamed of.
Where town councils were once appointed by
the government in Amman, they are not elected by
the inhabitants. Unemployment, which under Jor
danian and Egyptian rule, hovered around 30 per
cent, is now around three per cent.
Perhaps most striking are Israel's gestures to
wards the Palestinian Arabs who fled in 1948. Is
rael inherited several hundred thousand of them in
1967 when it occupied the refugee camps in the
Gaza strip. Under Egyptian rule the Palestinians
had been virtual prisoners in these wretched

Dale Pearlman

camps, denied Egyptian citizenship, denied per
mission to leave and resettle elsewhere. While the
Arab states theoretically championed the Palesti
nian cause, in practice they left the Palestinian
people to rot.
Israel gave them employment opportunities and
has been offering government subsidized housing
along with attractive loans to help empty the
camps. And for other Palestinians, Israel has of
fered to negotiate for limited resettlement and re
parations for those who wish to settle elsewhere.
By contrast, the few Jews who remain in Arab
states live in constant terror with onerous legal
restrictions forbidding them most kinds of
employment and any freedom of movement. Arab
governments have offered no reparations to the
700,000 Jews who were forced to flee their lands,
most of whom settled in Israel.
Is it any wonder that Israelis look skeptically at
the Arab "peace overtures" that consist merely of
demands and threats, accompanied by the kind of
poison Abu El-Haija added to in his articles?
Israel has accepted so many peace plans that I've
lost count, while the Arab leadership has yet to
unambiguously renounce its goal of Israel's de
struction. Even the so-called "moderate" wing of
the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) is
forthright about seeing the proposed West Bank
Palestinian state as a springboard for the final as
sault on Tel Aviv.
But I still hope that young Arab leaders like Abu
El-Haija will eventually realize the need for com
promise, so that peace may come at last. If he
begins showing some good will to match Israel's,
then we can all turn away from hate and war and
toward the real business of building, learning to
gether and living in peace.

I read Ahmad Abu El-Haijas series of articles
with interest and with even greater sadness. For
here he is, a bright young man, a graduate student
in electrical engineering, probably destined to be
among the new leaders of your country, and yet he
repeats the same web of lies and half truths, the
same hatred and venom that continue to fuel the
Middle East conflict and prevent peace.
It's a hard thing to admit that both sides have
elements of right and justice, and that both peoples
are in the Middle East to stay. People of good will
could sit down together and come up with a set
tlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. I'm convinced
of that, and I fervently hope it will happen in my
life time. But for that, there must be good will on
both sides.
Israel has demonstrated that kind of good will
time and time again. It has maintained open bor
ders with Jordan to allow trade and repatriation of
families, even though the policy makes it easier for
terrorists to sneak over the border.
