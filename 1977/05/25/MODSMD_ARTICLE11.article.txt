## Long-term solutions needed for economic woes 
### 
Alter the recent econqmic
downturn, we need to look for
some long-range solutions to the
problems of inflation and un
employment. Unfortunately,
one of the most ludicrous prop
osals of all is being seriously
considered—the Full Employ
ment and Balanced Growth Act
by Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.) and Rep. Augustus Haw
kins (D-Calif.).
Democrat Arthur Okun of the
Brookings Institution has dis
missed it as "beautiful poetry,"
and even most liberal
economists realize its inability
to deliver its promised "guaran
teed" job to every willing
American. A bureaucrat's
dream, this horror "reads as
though it were drafted by the
editorial board of The National
Lampoon (syndicated columnist
Nicholas Von Hoffman).
In fact, the bill is a fraud. The
payment of prevailing wages
would force private business to
compete with the government,
which would in turn inflate
wages and lower capital
investment—resulting in less
jobs in the private sector.
In addition, the government
must get the extra $30 billion
from somewhere. If taxes are
raised, taxpayers will spend less,
and fewer people will be hired. If
the excess is borrowed, the len
ders and borrowers who were
outbid by the government would
have less to spend.
Fool's paradise
Or the government could sim
ply print money and tax
everyone indirectly through in
flation. Though this would mean
more government spending
without less private spending
for a short time, it is a "fool's
paradise that would not last."
Even the Congressional Budget
Office acknowledges the threat
the bill poses to inflation and the
inevitable loss of private

employment.
A more realistic approach is
the Jobs Creation Acts by Rep.
Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.). It seeks to
increase the incentives for in
vestment through lower tax
rates, investment credits and
other provisions.
It has been estimated that the

Kemp bill would add $151.4 bill
ion to the GNP, $5.2 billion to
federal revenues and up to 7.2
million new jobs in the first year.
The gains would increase as
more years go by. Though not
everyone agrees with these esti
mates, even a 50 per cent fulfill
ment would help solve many of
our economic problems.
But irrespective of any
specific plan, there are some
specific measures that should be
adopted. A permanent tax cut
should be enacted. Due inflation
and rising taxes, people have
lost purchasing power over the
past 10 years. A permanent tax
cut would be one of the most ef
ficacious methods for increasing
private saving, investment,
employment and, paradoxically
enough, federal revenues.
The best evidence in support
of a tax cut is the experience of
President John Kennedy, who
sought to stimulate a sluggish
economy in 1961 by the same
method. From 1962 to 1967 the
country enjoyed among the best
periods of economic growth in
recent history. Revenues actu
ally increased by $54 billion,
rather than falling $89 billion as
projected by the Department of
the Treasury.
Political targets
Another measure, which is
supported by the liberal Ameri
cans for Democratic Action
(headed by Sen. George
McGovern (D-S.D.), is to end the
corporate income tax. Corpora
tions are convenient political
targets because no one really
knows who bears the burden of
the tax. Only people pay taxes,
and "by their very nature (corpo
rations) do not ordinarily pay
taxes so much as collect them"
(Irving Kristol).
There are only three possible
sources for the money to pay the
tax. The first is to cut dividends,
which results in a concealed tax
on dividend income. The second
is to raise prices, which is in ef
fect a concealed sales tax.
The third is to take the money
from retained income. Since this
is the money that is otherwise
invested, capital formation falls
and less jobs are created. The
corporate income tax is then in
effect a concealed tax on
employment—which obviously
falls on the unemployed. In the
end, only people pay. The only
question is who.
And probably the most impor
tant proposal is to repeal the
most racist of laws —the
minimum wage. Described by
economist M. Bruce Johnson as
attempting to "accomplish by
decree the impossible dream,"
the law has its greatest impact on
black teenagers.

The reason is quite simple—
economic forces do not give way
to political myopia. Those who
lack the training, skills, educa
tion and experience to produce
over $2.30 an hour will not be
hired; businesses are not loss
making enterprises.
During the early 1950s black
and white teenage unemploy
ment were both at about eight
per cent. The minimum wage
has risen to $2.30, and black
teenage unemployment has
sharply diverged from that of
white teenagers and is now over
37 per cent. UCLA economist
Finis Welch estimates that teen
age employment has been re
duced by as much as 40 per cent
in low-wage states like Arkan
sas, and 14 per cent in higher
wage states like Illinois and New
Jersey. Studies by many others
have come to the same result.
Legal burdens
And last year, Prof. Walter
Williams, a black economist
from the Temple University in
Pennsylvania, prepared a study
for the Joint Economic Commit
tee which found that the law
burdened the "most disadvan
taged" and the "most marginal."
Marginal workers are dispro
portionately composed of the
young —because of a lack of job
skills and maturity, blacks —
because of race discrimination
and socio-economic factors,
women, the uneducated and the
physically handicapped. Quite
simply, the minimum wage law
is a chauvinistic and racist de
vice for the middle-aged, edu
cated and skilled white male.
Thus the very people who are
supposed to be helped are hurt
and in a devastating fashion.
Four of every 10 black teenagers
can't find work—is it better to be
unemployed at $2.30 an hour
rather than be employed at $2 an
hour? Should we deny someone
the opportunity to gain training
and work experience because he
isn't skilled enough to earn
$2.30 an hour? Is forced un
employment better for his fam
ily, his future employment and
his self-respect?
These proposals would go a
long way toward solving some of
the economic problems that face
us today. They deserve careful
consideration and support by all
of us and our leaders.

sharply diverged from that of
white teenagers and is now over
37 per cent. UCLA economist
Finis Welch estimates that teen
age employment has been re
duced by as much as 40 per cent
in low-wage states like Arkan
sas, and 14 per cent in higher
wage states like Illinois and New
Jersey. Studies by many others
have come to the same result.
Legal burdens
And last year, Prof. Walter
Williams, a black economist
from the Temple University in
Pennsylvania, prepared a study
for the Joint Economic Commit
tee which found that the law
burdened the "most disadvan
taged" and the "most marginal."
Marginal workers are dispro
portionately composed of the
young —because of a lack of job
skills and maturity, blacks —
because of race discrimination
and socio-economic factors,
women, the uneducated and the
physically handicapped. Quite
simply, the minimum wage law
is a chauvinistic and racist de
vice for the middle-aged, edu
cated and skilled white male.
Thus the very people who are
supposed to be helped are hurt
and in a devastating fashion.
Four of every 10 black teenagers
can't find work—is it better to be
unemployed at $2.30 an hour
rather than be employed at $2 an
hour? Should we deny someone
the opportunity to gain training
and work experience because he
isn't skilled enough to earn
$2.30 an hour? Is forced un
employment better for his fam
ily, his future employment and
his self-respect?
These proposals would go a
long way toward solving some of
the economic problems that face
us today. They deserve careful
consideration and support by all
of us and our leaders.

Alter the recent econqmic
downturn, we need to look for
some long-range solutions to the
problems of inflation and un
employment. Unfortunately,
one of the most ludicrous prop
osals of all is being seriously
considered—the Full Employ
ment and Balanced Growth Act
by Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.) and Rep. Augustus Haw
kins (D-Calif.).
Democrat Arthur Okun of the
Brookings Institution has dis
missed it as "beautiful poetry,"
and even most liberal
economists realize its inability
to deliver its promised "guaran
teed" job to every willing
American. A bureaucrat's
dream, this horror "reads as
though it were drafted by the
editorial board of The National
Lampoon (syndicated columnist
Nicholas Von Hoffman).
In fact, the bill is a fraud. The
payment of prevailing wages
would force private business to
compete with the government,
which would in turn inflate
wages and lower capital
investment—resulting in less
jobs in the private sector.
In addition, the government
must get the extra $30 billion
from somewhere. If taxes are
raised, taxpayers will spend less,
and fewer people will be hired. If
the excess is borrowed, the len
ders and borrowers who were
outbid by the government would
have less to spend.
Fool's paradise
Or the government could sim
ply print money and tax
everyone indirectly through in
flation. Though this would mean
more government spending
without less private spending
for a short time, it is a "fool's
paradise that would not last."
Even the Congressional Budget
Office acknowledges the threat
the bill poses to inflation and the
inevitable loss of private

employment.
A more realistic approach is
the Jobs Creation Acts by Rep.
Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.). It seeks to
increase the incentives for in
vestment through lower tax
rates, investment credits and
other provisions.
It has been estimated that the

Kemp bill would add $151.4 bill
ion to the GNP, $5.2 billion to
federal revenues and up to 7.2
million new jobs in the first year.
The gains would increase as
more years go by. Though not
everyone agrees with these esti
mates, even a 50 per cent fulfill
ment would help solve many of
our economic problems.
But irrespective of any
specific plan, there are some
specific measures that should be
adopted. A permanent tax cut
should be enacted. Due inflation
and rising taxes, people have
lost purchasing power over the
past 10 years. A permanent tax
cut would be one of the most ef
ficacious methods for increasing
private saving, investment,
employment and, paradoxically
enough, federal revenues.
The best evidence in support
of a tax cut is the experience of
President John Kennedy, who
sought to stimulate a sluggish
economy in 1961 by the same
method. From 1962 to 1967 the
country enjoyed among the best
periods of economic growth in
recent history. Revenues actu
ally increased by $54 billion,
rather than falling $89 billion as
projected by the Department of
the Treasury.
Political targets
Another measure, which is
supported by the liberal Ameri
cans for Democratic Action
(headed by Sen. George
McGovern (D-S.D.), is to end the
corporate income tax. Corpora
tions are convenient political
targets because no one really
knows who bears the burden of
the tax. Only people pay taxes,
and "by their very nature (corpo
rations) do not ordinarily pay
taxes so much as collect them"
(Irving Kristol).
There are only three possible
sources for the money to pay the
tax. The first is to cut dividends,
which results in a concealed tax
on dividend income. The second
is to raise prices, which is in ef
fect a concealed sales tax.
The third is to take the money
from retained income. Since this
is the money that is otherwise
invested, capital formation falls
and less jobs are created. The
corporate income tax is then in
effect a concealed tax on
employment—which obviously
falls on the unemployed. In the
end, only people pay. The only
question is who.
And probably the most impor
tant proposal is to repeal the
most racist of laws —the
minimum wage. Described by
economist M. Bruce Johnson as
attempting to "accomplish by
decree the impossible dream,"
the law has its greatest impact on
black teenagers.

The reason is quite simple—
economic forces do not give way
to political myopia. Those who
lack the training, skills, educa
tion and experience to produce
over $2.30 an hour will not be
hired; businesses are not loss
making enterprises.
During the early 1950s black
and white teenage unemploy
ment were both at about eight
per cent. The minimum wage
has risen to $2.30, and black
teenage unemployment has
sharply diverged from that of
white teenagers and is now over
37 per cent. UCLA economist
Finis Welch estimates that teen
age employment has been re

Political targets
Another measure, which is
supported by the liberal Ameri
cans for Democratic Action
(headed by Sen. George
McGovern (D-S.D.), is to end the
corporate income tax. Corpora
tions are convenient political
targets because no one really
knows who bears the burden of
the tax. Only people pay taxes,
and "by their very nature (corpo
rations) do not ordinarily pay
taxes so much as collect them"
(Irving Kristol).
There are only three possible
sources for the money to pay the
tax. The first is to cut dividends,
which results in a concealed tax
on dividend income. The second
is to raise prices, which is in ef
fect a concealed sales tax.
The third is to take the money
from retained income. Since this
is the money that is otherwise
invested, capital formation falls
and less jobs are created. The
corporate income tax is then in
effect a concealed tax on
employment—which obviously
falls on the unemployed. In the
end, only people pay. The only
question is who.
And probably the most impor
tant proposal is to repeal the
most racist of laws —the
minimum wage. Described by
economist M. Bruce Johnson as
attempting to "accomplish by
decree the impossible dream,"
the law has its greatest impact on
black teenagers.

The reason is quite simple—
economic forces do not give way
to political myopia. Those who
lack the training, skills, educa
tion and experience to produce
over $2.30 an hour will not be
hired; businesses are not loss
making enterprises.
During the early 1950s black
and white teenage unemploy
ment were both at about eight
per cent. The minimum wage
has risen to $2.30, and black
teenage unemployment has
sharply diverged from that of
white teenagers and is now over
37 per cent. UCLA economist
Finis Welch estimates that teen
age employment has been re
duced by as much as 40 per cent
in low-wage states like Arkan
sas, and 14 per cent in higher
wage states like Illinois and New
Jersey. Studies by many others
have come to the same result.
Legal burdens
And last year, Prof. Walter
Williams, a black economist
from the Temple University in
Pennsylvania, prepared a study
for the Joint Economic Commit
tee which found that the law
burdened the "most disadvan
taged" and the "most marginal."
Marginal workers are dispro
portionately composed of the
young —because of a lack of job
skills and maturity, blacks —
because of race discrimination
and socio-economic factors,
women, the uneducated and the
physically handicapped. Quite
simply, the minimum wage law
is a chauvinistic and racist de
vice for the middle-aged, edu
cated and skilled white male.
Thus the very people who are
supposed to be helped are hurt
and in a devastating fashion.
Four of every 10 black teenagers
can't find work—is it better to be
unemployed at $2.30 an hour
rather than be employed at $2 an
hour? Should we deny someone
the opportunity to gain training
and work experience because he
isn't skilled enough to earn
$2.30 an hour? Is forced un
employment better for his fam
ily, his future employment and
his self-respect?
These proposals would go a
long way toward solving some of
the economic problems that face
us today. They deserve careful
consideration and support by all
of us and our leaders.

Alter the recent econqmic
downturn, we need to look for
some long-range solutions to the
problems of inflation and un
employment. Unfortunately,
one of the most ludicrous prop
osals of all is being seriously
considered—the Full Employ
ment and Balanced Growth Act
by Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.) and Rep. Augustus Haw
kins (D-Calif.).
Democrat Arthur Okun of the
Brookings Institution has dis
missed it as "beautiful poetry,"
and even most liberal
economists realize its inability
to deliver its promised "guaran
teed" job to every willing
American. A bureaucrat's
dream, this horror "reads as
though it were drafted by the
editorial board of The National
Lampoon (syndicated columnist
Nicholas Von Hoffman).
In fact, the bill is a fraud. The
payment of prevailing wages
would force private business to
compete with the government,
which would in turn inflate
wages and lower capital
investment—resulting in less
jobs in the private sector.
In addition, the government
must get the extra $30 billion
from somewhere. If taxes are
raised, taxpayers will spend less,
and fewer people will be hired. If
the excess is borrowed, the len
ders and borrowers who were
outbid by the government would
have less to spend.
Fool's paradise
Or the government could sim
ply print money and tax
everyone indirectly through in
flation. Though this would mean
more government spending
without less private spending
for a short time, it is a "fool's
paradise that would not last."
Even the Congressional Budget
Office acknowledges the threat
the bill poses to inflation and the
inevitable loss of private

employment.
A more realistic approach is
the Jobs Creation Acts by Rep.
Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.). It seeks to
increase the incentives for in
vestment through lower tax
rates, investment credits and
other provisions.
It has been estimated that the

Kemp bill would add $151.4 bill
ion to the GNP, $5.2 billion to
federal revenues and up to 7.2
million new jobs in the first year.
The gains would increase as
more years go by. Though not
everyone agrees with these esti
mates, even a 50 per cent fulfill
ment would help solve many of
our economic problems.
But irrespective of any
specific plan, there are some
specific measures that should be
adopted. A permanent tax cut
should be enacted. Due inflation
and rising taxes, people have
lost purchasing power over the
past 10 years. A permanent tax
cut would be one of the most ef
ficacious methods for increasing
private saving, investment,
employment and, paradoxically
enough, federal revenues.
The best evidence in support
of a tax cut is the experience of
President John Kennedy, who
sought to stimulate a sluggish
economy in 1961 by the same
method. From 1962 to 1967 the
country enjoyed among the best
periods of economic growth in
recent history. Revenues actu
ally increased by $54 billion,
rather than falling $89 billion as
projected by the Department of
the Treasury.
