# Housing boom will yield to larger construction
## 
### 
New York (AP) — America's single-family hous
ing boom will begin to wane within the next two
years as other types of construction begin to ex
pand, a national banker's convention was told yes
terday.
Housing, and especially single-family housing,
is "a notoriously cyclical building market" which
"typically begins to fade once the rest of the
economy heats up," said George Christie, chief
economist of McGraw-Hill Information Systems
Co.
The slack in construction typically is taken up
by multiple-family and commercial building in a
"very normal recovery pattern for the construction
markets," Christie told reporters before addressing
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, an
organization of bankers, real estate investors and
consultants.
Forecast
The National Association of Home Builders is
forecasting 1.4 million single-family housing
starts this year, up from 1.16 million in 1976 and
surpassing the record of 1.3 million starts in the
prerecession year of 1972.
But Christie, whose company is a leading com
piler of data on the construction business, said he
expects the total to be only about 1.3 million this
year, with a 100,000 to 200,000-unit drop in 1976.
John Wetmore, chief economist for the mortgage
bankers, agreed that housing construction is likely

to taper off but gave a more optimistic forecast.
According to Wetmore, single-family housing
starts should total 1.4 million to 1.5 million tliis
year and gain 100,000 in 1978 before dropping.
"The children of the post-World War II baby
boom are becoming first-home purchasers in re
cord numbers," Wetmore said.
Christie disagreed, saying the boom in the
number of young people buying homes "began
five years ago and has already peaked."
He said home mortgage money is available in
lean economic periods, in part because businesses
aren't borrowing to expand their facilities.
Slowdown .
As the economy heats up, however, the boom fed
by mortgage money starts to slow.
"I see a three-stage transition," Christie said of
the coming two years.
For the rest of 1977, single-family construction
will level off, with some increases continuing in
the West and South, "where there is still room for
one-family gains."
Next year, Christie expects home building to
drop as mortgage markets are "squeezed by rising
business demand for funds and continued tight
money." In 1979, he sees "the lagging cycles of
apartments and commercial building" coming to
an end and replacing some single-family construc
tion.

"typically begins to fade once the rest of the
economy heats up," said George Christie, chief
economist of McGraw-Hill Information Systems
Co.
The slack in construction typically is taken up
by multiple-family and commercial building in a
"very normal recovery pattern for the construction
markets," Christie told reporters before addressing
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, an
organization of bankers, real estate investors and
consultants.
Forecast
The National Association of Home Builders is
forecasting 1.4 million single-family housing
starts this year, up from 1.16 million in 1976 and
surpassing the record of 1.3 million starts in the
prerecession year of 1972.
But Christie, whose company is a leading com
piler of data on the construction business, said he
expects the total to be only about 1.3 million this
year, with a 100,000 to 200,000-unit drop in 1976.
John Wetmore, chief economist for the mortgage
bankers, agreed that housing construction is likely

to taper off but gave a more optimistic forecast.
According to Wetmore, single-family housing
starts should total 1.4 million to 1.5 million tliis
year and gain 100,000 in 1978 before dropping.
"The children of the post-World War II baby
boom are becoming first-home purchasers in re
cord numbers," Wetmore said.
Christie disagreed, saying the boom in the
number of young people buying homes "began
five years ago and has already peaked."
He said home mortgage money is available in
lean economic periods, in part because businesses
aren't borrowing to expand their facilities.
Slowdown .
As the economy heats up, however, the boom fed
by mortgage money starts to slow.
"I see a three-stage transition," Christie said of
the coming two years.
For the rest of 1977, single-family construction
will level off, with some increases continuing in
the West and South, "where there is still room for
one-family gains."
Next year, Christie expects home building to
drop as mortgage markets are "squeezed by rising
business demand for funds and continued tight
money." In 1979, he sees "the lagging cycles of
apartments and commercial building" coming to
an end and replacing some single-family construc
tion.
