Bovensmilde, The Nether
lands (AP) — Anguish and help
less fury grew among parents
and other townsfolk in this
northern Dutch village yester
day as South Moluccan terrorists
held 105 children and six
teachers hostage in the village
school for a second day.
There was talk of reprisals
against other South Moluccans
here.
"God help them if they kill any
of those poor kids," said taxi
driver Pieter Kan. "It will mean
civil war around here. The
people here are ready to lynch
them."
Ten miles away a second
group of South Moluccans held
50 to 60 other hostages on a
hijacked train standing quietly
in the middle of flat green pas
tured nd.
As a deadline neared for

threatened death of hostages, the
Dutch government was silent on
whether it intended to meet the
demands of the militant Asian
immigrants.
The gunmen — six at the
school and seven on the train —
were demanding that 21 jailed
South Moluccans be released by
the Dutch government and that
all 34 South Moluccans and at
least some of the hostages be
flown out of the country on a
jumbo jet. They set a deadline of
2 p.m. local time, 5 a.m. PDT to
day.
Fourteen of the prisoners were
serving sentences for a similar
twin terrorist strike in 1975,
when they tried to force the
Dutch government to help them
win independence from In
donesia for their homeland. In
donesia and the South Molucca
islands were once Dutch col
onies.
Destination?
It was not known where the
terrorists wanted to be flown.
Justice Ministry spokeswo
man Toos Faber said there were
no negotiations under way at
either site, about 90 miles north
east of Amsterdam.
"The terrorists have consis
tently let us know in the few
conversations we have had that
they do not wish to negotiate,
nor do they want a mediator,"

she said.
In a list of demands released
yesterday, the South Moluccans
warned they would "in no case
tolerate mediators. If they
nevertheless come, then dead
will fall."
The few contacts authorities
have had with the terrorists have
been made through specially in
stalled telephone links to the
train and school.
Gunshots rang out yesterday
morning at the school, where the
gunmen also held six teachers,
but police said the South Moluc
cans had only fired into the air to
get them to speed up delivery of
food.
The extremists fired into the
air again several hours later
when a woman who authorities
said escaped from a mental in
stitution somehow slipped
through policelinesand reached
a bicycle shed next to the school.
Two policemen, stripped to their
undershorts to show they were
unarmed, walked to the shed
and retrieved the woman.
Police said they did not be
lieve anyone was hurt in the
shooting incidents. There have
been no casualties reported
since the two bands of
submachine-gunned armed
South Moluccans seized the
school and the train in coordi
nated strikes Monday morning.
