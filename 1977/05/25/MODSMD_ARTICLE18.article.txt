Who ore the Escondido Hi-rises numed for and
what do they do to deserve such a fate?
-ABC
First, I want to thank Roxanne Nilan at Univer
sity Archives for her help inuncovering this story.
At Escondido Village, there is a small cottage
which is now used for administrative purposes.
Long, long ago, before the Stanfords came, the
cottage was owned by a Peter Coutts.
When the University was founded in 1891, the
first president, David Starr Jordan, made the cot
tage his residence for a year or two. He named this
cottage "Escondite," which is French for "hiding
place."
However, before this name could be bestowed
upon the village and hi-rises, the University de
cided to add an "o" to the end to make the word
sound more Spanish, in keeping with the Univer
sity image.
So that's how it all came about. It gives one a
little more appreciation for names and places
when their background is known, don't you
think' Thanks again to Roxanne Nilan!
What herbicides and pesticides does the Uni
versity use? (I saw them spraying weeds a while
back.)
Especially, 1 wan to know how long the chemi
cals Inst lif known). And what checks does the
University make before deciding to use them?
-H.M.
Herb Fong, grounds supervisor at Plant Ser
vices, says that they use many different herbicides,
but one which you might have seen being sprayed
on the weeds is Diquat.
Diquat, a non-crop weed killer, has a short active

cycle. It is a contact killer, meaning that it needs to
be sprayed directly upon the weeds. It is absorbed
by the plant and is very fast-acting. The results
may be noticed by the next day.
Since it is short-lived, application must be re
peated, but that also means that the chemical
doesn't sterilize the soil.
When not absorbed by the plant, Diquat is either
broken down by the light or rapidly absorbed by
the soil. So you don't have to worry about it linger
ing around.
As for regulation, Kong says that there is a
"Biocide Ecosystems Subcommittee" which
makes recommendations and decisions. Kong is
the chairman of the subcommittee, so if you want
to know more specifics, he would be the best man
to help you out.

Why on all television dramas-from soap operas
to "Charlie's Angels"-does every telephone
number that's mentioned begin with the prefix
"555"? Is this a way of avoiding complaints from
the owner of a real telephone number?
-H.R.
According to the folks at both the Palo Alto and
San Francisco business offices for Pacific Tele
phone, the prefix "555" is not used tor private
individuals. Its main use is for long distance direc
tory assistance.
So a television show would be fairly safe in
using the prefix "555" for any telephone numbers
used in the show, since no person has a telephone
number beginning with that prefix.

Who ore the Escondido Hi-rises numed for and
what do they do to deserve such a fate?
-ABC
First, I want to thank Roxanne Nilan at Univer
sity Archives for her help inuncovering this story.
At Escondido Village, there is a small cottage
which is now used for administrative purposes.
Long, long ago, before the Stanfords came, the
cottage was owned by a Peter Coutts.
When the University was founded in 1891, the
first president, David Starr Jordan, made the cot
tage his residence for a year or two. He named this
cottage "Escondite," which is French for "hiding
place."
However, before this name could be bestowed
upon the village and hi-rises, the University de
cided to add an "o" to the end to make the word
sound more Spanish, in keeping with the Univer
sity image.
So that's how it all came about. It gives one a
little more appreciation for names and places
when their background is known, don't you
think' Thanks again to Roxanne Nilan!
What herbicides and pesticides does the Uni
versity use? (I saw them spraying weeds a while
back.)
Especially, 1 wan to know how long the chemi
cals Inst lif known). And what checks does the
University make before deciding to use them?
-H.M.
Herb Fong, grounds supervisor at Plant Ser
vices, says that they use many different herbicides,
but one which you might have seen being sprayed
on the weeds is Diquat.
Diquat, a non-crop weed killer, has a short active

cycle. It is a contact killer, meaning that it needs to
be sprayed directly upon the weeds. It is absorbed
by the plant and is very fast-acting. The results
may be noticed by the next day.
Since it is short-lived, application must be re
peated, but that also means that the chemical
doesn't sterilize the soil.
When not absorbed by the plant, Diquat is either
broken down by the light or rapidly absorbed by
the soil. So you don't have to worry about it linger
ing around.
As for regulation, Kong says that there is a
"Biocide Ecosystems Subcommittee" which
makes recommendations and decisions. Kong is
the chairman of the subcommittee, so if you want
to know more specifics, he would be the best man
to help you out.

Why on all television dramas-from soap operas
to "Charlie's Angels"-does every telephone
number that's mentioned begin with the prefix
"555"? Is this a way of avoiding complaints from
the owner of a real telephone number?
-H.R.
According to the folks at both the Palo Alto and
San Francisco business offices for Pacific Tele
phone, the prefix "555" is not used tor private
individuals. Its main use is for long distance direc
tory assistance.
So a television show would be fairly safe in
using the prefix "555" for any telephone numbers
used in the show, since no person has a telephone
number beginning with that prefix.
