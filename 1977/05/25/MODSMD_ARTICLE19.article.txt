## Netters knock off Utah, Cal; meet UCLA in NCAA semis 
### Jill Lieber 
"Our guys are not awed by
UCLA," said coach Dick Gould
yesterday in a telephone inter
view from Athens, Ga. "They are
certainly not over confident
about the match. But each feels
he can win his prospective
match."
The No. 3 seeded Stanford net
ters move into today's semifinals
against No. 1 seed UCLA after
beating Utah 8-1 on Monday and
Cal 5-1 yesterday.
"UCLA has a strong doubles
contingent," Gould said. "I look
for a tough match. We are play
ing well as a team. We're tough
and competitive.
"There is no question that
UCLA is the team to beat in the
tournament. All the guys are
going to have to play really well
to beat them."
Mitch on the ball
The Cards' Matt Mitchell,
seeded No. 1 in the individual
singles portion of the tourney, is
playing very well and Gould
looks to him for help in downing
the tough Bruin squad.
Against Utah, Mitchell posted
a victory over Kent Crawford,
3-6, 6-4, 6-4. Yesterday, the
sophomore All-American
downed Cal's Cary Stansbury,
6-4, 6-4.
"Matt has held it really well all
year," Gould said. "He was
seeded No. 1 at the National
Amateur Indoors champion
ships (which he won) and he has
been under pressure all year
long. He's handled it beauti
fully."
Under the weather
Gould said his No. 2 man,
junior All-American Bill Maze,
is to be complimented for the
pressure he too has had to fight
off. Maze was doubtful to make
the trip to Georgia because last
week he came down with a vio
lent case of food poisoning.
"I wasn't even sure Bill would
make the flight," Gould said.
"He was terribly sick. He didn't
play at all on Saturday. Sunday,
he barely worked out."
Monday he lost to Utah's Jim
Greenburg, 6-3, 2-6, 4-6. But yes
terday, fully recovered, he de
feated Cal's Marty Davis, 7-6
(5-2), 6-1.

"Our guys are not awed by
UCLA," said coach Dick Gould
yesterday in a telephone inter
view from Athens, Ga. "They are
certainly not over confident
about the match. But each feels
he can win his prospective
match."
The No. 3 seeded Stanford net
ters move into today's semifinals
against No. 1 seed UCLA after
beating Utah 8-1 on Monday and
Cal 5-1 yesterday.
"UCLA has a strong doubles
contingent," Gould said. "I look
for a tough match. We are play
ing well as a team. We're tough
and competitive.
"There is no question that
UCLA is the team to beat in the
tournament. All the guys are
going to have to play really well
to beat them."
Mitch on the ball
The Cards' Matt Mitchell,
seeded No. 1 in the individual
singles portion of the tourney, is
playing very well and Gould
looks to him for help in downing
the tough Bruin squad.
Against Utah, Mitchell posted
a victory over Kent Crawford,
3-6, 6-4, 6-4. Yesterday, the
sophomore All-American
downed Cal's Cary Stansbury,
6-4, 6-4.
"Matt has held it really well all
year," Gould said. "He was
seeded No. 1 at the National
Amateur Indoors champion
ships (which he won) and he has
been under pressure all year
long. He's handled it beauti
fully."
Under the weather
Gould said his No. 2 man,
junior All-American Bill Maze,
is to be complimented for the
pressure he too has had to fight
off. Maze was doubtful to make
the trip to Georgia because last
week he came down with a vio
lent case of food poisoning.
"I wasn't even sure Bill would
make the flight," Gould said.
"He was terribly sick. He didn't
play at all on Saturday. Sunday,
he barely worked out."
Monday he lost to Utah's Jim
Greenburg, 6-3, 2-6, 4-6. But yes
terday, fully recovered, he de
feated Cal's Marty Davis, 7-6
(5-2), 6-1.

view from Athens, Ga. "They are
certainly not over confident
about the match. But each feels
he can win his prospective
match."
The No. 3 seeded Stanford net
ters move into today's semifinals
against No. 1 seed UCLA after
beating Utah 8-1 on Monday and
Cal 5-1 yesterday.
"UCLA has a strong doubles
contingent," Gould said. "I look
for a tough match. We are play
ing well as a team. We're tough
and competitive.
"There is no question that
UCLA is the team to beat in the
tournament. All the guys are
going to have to play really well
to beat them."
Mitch on the ball
The Cards' Matt Mitchell,
seeded No. 1 in the individual
singles portion of the tourney, is
playing very well and Gould
looks to him for help in downing
the tough Bruin squad.
Against Utah, Mitchell posted
a victory over Kent Crawford,
3-6, 6-4, 6-4. Yesterday, the
sophomore All-American
downed Cal's Cary Stansbury,
6-4, 6-4.
"Matt has held it really well all
year," Gould said. "He was
seeded No. 1 at the National
Amateur Indoors champion
ships (which he won) and he has
been under pressure all year
long. He's handled it beauti
fully."
Under the weather
Gould said his No. 2 man,
junior All-American Bill Maze,
is to be complimented for the
pressure he too has had to fight
off. Maze was doubtful to make
the trip to Georgia because last
week he came down with a vio
lent case of food poisoning.
"I wasn't even sure Bill would
make the flight," Gould said.
"He was terribly sick. He didn't
play at all on Saturday. Sunday,
he barely worked out."
Monday he lost to Utah's Jim
Greenburg, 6-3, 2-6, 4-6. But yes
terday, fully recovered, he de
feated Cal's Marty Davis, 7-6
(5-2), 6-1.

"We are healthy enough to do
it," Gould said. "Bill is over the
flu and Lloyd's back is bothering
him, but I think he'll be able to
keep it from tightening up.
"This format of team competi
tion (first instigated this year) is
how NCAA play should be. We
play as a team all year and
should compete at the NCAAs as
a team.
"You know, we weren't that
good in the start of the year. We
had our problems as a team. But
now we are playing really well
and I hope we can do it."
