# Podgorny ousted from Soviet Politburo
## 
### Associated Press 
Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny,
one of the three most powerful men in
the country, was dropped without exp
lanation yesterday from the ruling
council of the Soviet Communist
party.
A brief communique over Moscow
radio and television did not say if the
74-year-old Podgorny would retain the
presidency, a largely ceremonial post,
but observers pointed out the position
would be virtually impossible to hold
without membership in the party's
Politburo.
Podgorny is the first of the three men
who overthrew Nikita Khrushchev in
1964 to fall by the political wayside.
Still in power are Communist party
leader Leonid Brezhnev, 70, viewed as
the country's most powerful politi
cian, and Premier Alexei Kosygin, 73.
U.S. experts say the removal is a
move by Brezhnev to consolidate and
perhaps expand his power.
Aging and ailing
Officials at the State Department and
the White House say the aging and ail
ing Brezhnev apparently acted against
Podgorny to overcome both foreign
and domestic problems which have re
flected badly on his regime.
Podgorny was one of the 15 Polit
buro members and had major diploma
tic responsibilities.
He was in charge of policy in the
Middle East, Africa and Vietnam. U.S.
officials said the Soviets have suffered
serious setbacks in all these areas.
The specialists also report that Pod
gorny recently began criticizing
Brezhnev's domestic economic
policies, charging him with failure to
overcome shortages and a falling in
dustrial level.
Power struggle
The Americans say proof that
Brezhnev was conducting a power
struggle was shown in the way Pod
gorny lost his position.
Instead of saying he had retired,
Podgorny was described by Moscow
radio as having been "freed" from his
responsibilities.
By holding both top Soviet postsâ€”
head of the party and president,
Brezhnev would be symbolized as
preeminent among Russian leaders.
Just how strong Brezhnev emerges
will be seen in the results in the next

meeting of the Russian parliament, the
Supreme Soviet, beginning June 16.
Brezhnev has asked the Supreme
Soviet to write a new constitution
which could give him even more
power.
The U.S. experts say a successful
conclusion to the power struggle by
Brezhnev could improve U.S.-Russian
relations.
Brezhnev, considered in favor of de
tente, reportedly has been held back
because of failures in both foreign and
domestic affairs, and because of op
position from Russian hardliners.
If he has overcome these problems,
the U.S. officials say a warmer trend

may be in view in dealings between
Washington and Moscow.
There was no sign whether Pod
gorny had retired voluntarily. In other
cases, Central Committee com
muniques often say a leading figure
has left in connection with retirement,
ill health or "at his own request."
Podgorny had recenly appeared in
robus political and physical health.
He toured black countries in South
ern Africa in March in a major dip
lomatic foray by the Kremlin into that
area. His name was on Soviet pages as
late as yesterday morning's Pravda,
the party newspaper, which carried
the text of a diplomatic telegram he

sent. His last public appearance was
last Friday, when he saw off visiting
Finnish President Urho Kekkonen at
Moscow Airport.
"I thought his progress through Af
rica was quite triumphal and he has
buen very active lately," said a West
ern diplomat here who was as sur
prised as most by Podgorny's demise
as a member of the Politburo.
"It would be difficult to see any out
standing political differences between
him and the rest of the Politburo."
No new member was named to the
Politburo to take Podgorny's place.
