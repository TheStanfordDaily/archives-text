# Will success spoil Clark Sterling? —or—
## Can six crazies stir a Stanford fan? 
### Bruce Anderson 
The ASSU Senate recently
passed a resolution stating that
Stanford "needed yell leaders as
much as it needed more nerds."
But while outside of the
Chaparral no one has expressed
interest in more nerds, 100 stu
dents and staff members turned
out two weeks ago to watch a
dozen undergraduates try out for
six yell leader openings.
And although opinion on yell
leaders here has ranged from the
open skepticism of the ASSU
Senate to the energetic optimism
of the yell leaders themselves,
who have opted for the name
"Athletic Supporters," the fact
remains that no one will know
whether the idea is a success or a
bust until after the autumnal
remigration of students to the
Farm.
Juniors Clark Sterling and
Megan Edwards and sopho
mores Leslie Crozier, Scott Han
ley, Bob Larson and Mike Thur
man are the six "Athletic Sup
porters" who recently sat down
with the Daily and offered their
thoughts on yell leadingat Stan
ford.
Daily: What do you perceive as
the need for yell leaders at Stan
ford and how do you expect to
fill that need?
Larson: The way I view it is that
yell leaders at Stanford, yell
leaders alone, aren't going to
change things. Just because you
have some people in front
doesn't necessarily mean the
crowd is going to behave any dif
ferently than it has in the past.'
I believe that one of the most

important functions for us, espe
cially in the first year, is to get
people together who have ex
pressed a desire to cheer and get
them into one section. 1 feel if
you get the people together who
want to cheer, it's going to create
a much more conducive atmos
phere than if you have them split
up amongst apathetics who do
not want to cheer.
Sterling: We have a real chal
lenge because we're the first
ones in quite a few years and I
think we're going to spend a lot
of time cheering with the crowd
instead of at the crowd.
Crozier: 1 think one of the har
dest parts, kind of like Clark
said, is that people at Stanford
are really wary of accepting
something new.

Hanley: I think there was a mis
conception when yell leaders
first came up. Most people fi
gured it was going to be a very
USC-type yell leader and
everyone was just going, "This'll
never work; this is ridiculous."
But after explaining to them
that that wasn't what you
wanted, then they were really
positive about it and said, "Oh,
you're not going to be up there
with your little sweaters and the
whole schmeer."
Thurman: 1 think one of the most
important things on the field is

going to be channeling the audi
ence as far as timing and things
like that. When they're ready to
yell, then we'll let 'em yell, give
them something to yell.
You could really see it, espe
cially last year at the Big Game,
people wanted to do
something—they ended up
shaking keys, doing anything.
They just didn't have anyone to
lead them or organize them.
Sterling: We're going to surprise
the crowd by being just as un
ique as the Band and the Dollies.
1 think that they (the student
body) are skeptical, yet they
should realize that we know
Stanford. We know what won't
workand what we thinkcan. Sol
don't think people should worry
that we're going to put aside the

. . . we're going to spend a lot of time cheering
with the crowd instead of at the crowd . . . we're
not the Stanford Entertainers.

feelings that we've had in the
past and try for something that
just wouldn't be appropriate.
Daily: In addition to the yell
leading function of your job,
there seems to be an entertain
ment aspect. How much of an
entertainment force do you see
yourselves being?
Crozier: Again, 1 think our
whole key to success next year
lies in our diversity and original
ity. We're really a diverse group
and I think that's a plus for us
because we all have different
ideas. And I think originality, for
Stanford to be successful and
pull it off, is going to be the main
thing.
Sterling: Until big games like
Cal or SC, people come to the
games for entertainment or for a
nice afternoon sitting in the sun.
We'll decide what kinds of
things we want to do and who's
going to be doing them. I think
we can entertain, especially at
the less exciting games, the way
the Band does now.
Hanley: But that won't be our
principal purpose.
Sterling: Right. We're not the
Stanford Entertainers. But at a
less exciting game we'll proba
bly do less yelling and more
original kinds of things than at
the Cal game where we'll yell
like crazy.
Daily: How do you plan to get
started during the fall?
Scott: Before school starts with
the freshmen at freshmen orien
tation, you can have a massive
effect on their first week at Stan
ford.
Larson: Both Scott and I feel it's
going to be real important to es
tablish a precedent in the
freshman class that this is some
thing that does exist and it is

going to work. We feel vve can
accomplish this by going around
with the Band and the Dollies
during those tour days while the
freshmen are here bafore the up
perclassmen arrive. You have to
impress upon them the fact that
this does exist in that stage when
they're still impressionable.
Crozier: When you come here
you're so gung-ho right out of
high school, you're really spi
rited...then you re stifled by all
the upperclassmen. So I think if
you get to them when they're
still really gung-ho that's a great
opportunity.
Thurman: We've got certain
forces that we're going to have
on our side and certain forces
that we're going to be trying to
draw on our side.
One is the freshmen. There's
probably a higher percentage of
freshmen at the games than up
perclassmen. We've got the
Band which is really important.
Hopefully, we'll have a little
fraternity support.
We really need the Band be
cause if we don't have the Band's
support, well, I think that's part
of the reason yell leaders didn't
work so well in the past.
Larson: Just to clarify another
point: Clark mentioned yelling
with the crowd and I feel that's
very important. 1 don't feel that
we can be out on the track yel
ling at the crowd. I don't think
that students here are going to go
for the type of thing, "Okay, now
repeat after me."
Sterling: Yell leaders at most
other universities that I've seen
are elite. They stand on the track
and even when they're not yel
ling they walk around with their
hands in their pockets and look
big.
And they have cute song girls
who stand there with their palms
at their sides and stand on the
track the whole time, very elite.
We're going to be sitting in with
the crowd most of the time and
not at all separate.
Daily: Megan, you haven't said
much.
Edwards: One thing I've thought
about is that I always see the
alumni sitting out there with
their tailgate parties and their
drinks and I think we could get
out there and talk to them a little
before the game. They have voi
ces, they have kids....
Crozier: You know they'd jump
at the chance to feel they were a
part, to revert to their college
days.
Larson: I think it's also impor
tant to get to know some of the
athletes and get to know what
they're thinking and what's
going to get them fired up.
Sterling: I think our biggest suc
cess would be to find out that the
players enjoyed playing at home
now.


Southern Cal cool
Junior Clark Sterling does his best to affect the cool of a South
ern California yell leader at yell leader tryouts two weeks ago.

The eyes of Texas
With mouths agape, the crowd yells with sophomore Leslie Crozier, showing that the boo is not the
only verbal response fans are capable of at Stanford games. Crozier, from Dallas, Texas, donned
her cowpuncher regalia to lead students in a round of "Hey Berkeley, no big deal!" at yell leader
tryouts.
