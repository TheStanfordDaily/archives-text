Agnew's resignation reviewed
Washington — Richard Nixon says that
when he learned in 1973 about the investiga
tions involving Spiro Agnew, "there wasn't
any question . . . that he was, frankly, going to
get it."
In an interview to be shown on television
tonight, Nixon discusses for the first time what
happened inside the White House in the weeks
preceding the Oct. 10, 1973, resignation ofAg
new. He describes his handling of the matter as
"pragmatic."
Nixon also talks about suggestions that he
pardon himself; his final days in office; his
thoughts as he left the White House for the last
time as president; his offer of legal fees to
former aides H.R. Haldeman and John
Ehrlichman and why he didn't pardon them.
He also tells why he accepted the pardon
issued by his successor, Gerald Ford, one
month after Nixon left office, and his thoughts
about the press.
Despite his own Watergate problems, then
bad and getting worse, Nixon said he treated
Agnew's troubles as political, rather than put
ting himself in a position of judge.
The former president said he called Agnew
into his office on Sept. 25, 1973, and asked
point blank whether the vice president was
maintaining his innocence. Agnew, according
to Nixon, said he was.
But Henry Petersen, head of the Justice De
partment's criminal division, told him the case
against Agnew was strong, Nixon said. The

department had made a 40-page statement de
tailing kickback payments from engineering
firms to Agnew. The vice president later was
allowed to plead no contest to a single charge
of tax evasion and placed on three years proba
tion.
UC regents defend investments
Berkeley — Five University of California
Regents agreed yesterday that apartheid in
South Africa is wrong, but defended invest
ments in companies that do business in the
racially segregated country.
The regents spent more than two hours dis
cussing university investments and the con
troversial Alan Bakkecourt decision with more
than 1000 angry, hissing and cat-calling stu
dents.
Regents Chairman William Coblentz said the
university's $1.7 billion investment portfolio
was composed of endowment and pension
funds which must be "zealously" guarded.
"That money doesn't belong to us and it
doesn't belong to you," he told the partisan
audience. "It belongs to the employes ot the
university as retirement funds. We are only the
trustees and we have a moral obligation to
handle that money wisely."
The confrontation yesterday grew out of a
regularly scheduled regents meeting last week
which was disrupted by more than 300 stu
dents demanding withdrawal of investments
from companies doing business in South Af
rica.
Coblentz said he sympathized with the stu
dents and agreed that the regents should look
"with concern" at the employment and racial
policies of companies in which they had in
vested.
Regent Earl Willens said the 23-member
board "should question company policies but 1
don't think we should create a void" by de
manding that those companies withdraw from
the African nation.
Joseph Leitmann of Campuses United
Against Apartheid told the regents they should
make every effort to discourage any dealings
with the white-ruled country until its black
majority gains power.

"There comes a time where profit maximiza
tion can no longer be a prime concern where
there is systematic destruction of human life,"
Leitmann said to noisy applause.
Court rules against strikers
New York — A federal judge ruled yesterday
that it is unconstitutional for striking workers
to collect unemployment pay.
U.S. District Court judge Richard Owen
ruled on a suit brought by New York Tele
phone and other utility companies complain
ing that the state law .iuthorizing such pay
ments unfairly compelled employers to fi
nance their own striking employes.
"The New York labor law, to the extent it
provides tor the payment of unemployment
compensation to strikers, is strike intervention
on behalf ot the strikers, causes an employer to
finance its own strikers, is in conflict with fed
eral labor law policy, and is therefore uncon
stitutional and void under the supremacy
clause of the United States Constitution,"
Owen ruled in a 37-page opinion.
Proposed Laetrile tests endorsed
Washington — The ranks of organized
medicine have broken .or the first time in the
long controversy over (he alleged anticancer
agent Laetrile.
One of the most respected voices in Ameri
can medicine. Dr. Lewis Thomas, now says
that human clinical tests must be undertaken
and he is known to feel that the matter is ur
gent. But yesterday the American Cancer Soci
ety expressed shock at the idea.
Thomas, president of the Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said
Monday: "1 think proper clinical trials have to
be undertaken."
He is known to feel that the medical and
scientific professions must act to establish the
facts because several states have approved the
use of Laetrile without medical evidence of its
effectiveness.
Thomas feels that a special epidemiological
team should conduct a study of people who

claim to have benefited from Laetrile treatment
and to find out what kind of cancer they had,
what other treatment they received and what
the results were.
Further, Thomas says a special committee
should be established to review the results of
both studies. The committee should be com
prised of both professionals and laymen, he
says.
Thomas' comments came as the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) said it is "seriously con
sidering" using Laetrile in tests on humans.
The American Cancer Society, however, said
that it was "a little shocked" at the statement
by the NCI. The American Medical Association
said it was standing by its position that Laetrile
is not recognized as either safe or effective.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
takes the position that Laetrile must first be
shown in animal trials to be safe and effective
before any human trials can be undertaken.
The FDA has banned Laetrile from interstate
commerce but this ban does not apply to Laet
rile produced and used within an individual
state.
Palestinian homeland discussed
Washington — President Jimmy Carter and
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Fahd yesterday
discussed a "process" for setting up a Palesti
nian homeland with "recognized boundaries"
alongside a secure Israel, a White House
spokesman said.
"The United States is not pushing for any
particular solution at this point," Jody Powell,
Carter's press secretary, said in reporting on
the leaders' first round of talks.
However, Powell said they had taken up the
subject of a Palestinian homeland with "some
degree of specificity" in a relaxed, friendly and
serious exchange in the Oval Office that lasted
more than two hours.
"That process by which you would reach a
secure homeland for the Palestinians and a
secure state of Israel with recognized bound
aries for each surely was a topic of discussion,"
Powell said.
Several weeks ago Carter endorsed a home
land for Palestinian refugees. He was the first

president to take that stand. But he was not
clear if he meant an independent state, as de
manded by the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion, or an enclave within Jordan.
The fact that he and Fahd talked in terms of
"recognized boundaries" suggests the presi
dent is edging toward the concept of statehood.
However, Powell, when questioned closely,
said recognized boundaries would be relevant
to either a Palestinian state or an entity within
Jordan.
Fahd is here for two days of talks.
