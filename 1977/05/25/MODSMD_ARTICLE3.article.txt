# IFC gives OK to arbitration committee
## 
### Chris Wasney 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
unanimously ratified a new constitu
tion and elected Theta Delta Chi
member Reid Butler president for the
next academic year in a meeting Mon
day afternoon.
The extensively-rewritten constitu
tion was passed in an effort to
strengthen the IFC and made it the sole
representative body of the fraternity
system, according to Jordan Schwartz,
former IFC president and author of the
new constitution.
The two major changes in the con
stitution will provide for mandatory
IFC membership for all house presi
dents and an IFC Arbitration Commit
tee to settle disputes within the frater
nity system.
Mandatory membership for house
presidents will increase the legitimacy
of the IFC by effectively forcing the
University to recognize it as the sole
representative of the frats, according to
Schwartz.
"In the past, the University has cir
cumvented the IFC by calling house
presidents' meetings. Now the presi
dents will be in the IFC, so it will be
come a more legitimate body in the
eyes of the frats and the University,"
said Schwartz.
"Having two bodies represent the
fraternity system was counterproduc
tive," he added.
The Arbitration Committee will
consist of the IFC president, two active

frat members, one frat house associate
(RA) and a member of the alumni IFC.
"The committee will make the frats
self-policing, so that we can handle
our own affairs without the University
jumping in," said Schwartz.
Creation of the committee follows
the University's decision last spring to
deny the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
group living privileges for this year.
Schwartz, a member of the Delts, said
he felt the punishment might not have
been so severe if there had been an
arbitration board.
In minor disputes, the committee
will have power to fine the offending
party and assess it for damages. In
more severe incidents, the committee
will act in an advisory capacity to
Norm Robinson, associate dean of stu
dent affairs and James Lyons, dean of
student affairs.
A provision of the new constitution
calls for "perfection" of the committee
by Jan. 1, 1978. This means explicitly
spelling out its guidelines for frat con
duct and parameters of operation
under the Stanford Judicial Charter,
explained Schwartz.
"It is especially important to draw
the line between the action of an indi
vidual and the action of a house," he
said.
Robinson voiced approval for the
committee and the IFC's move toward
self-policing. He said the influence of
the IFC committee will depend on the
issue and the strength of its recom

mendation.
"Because the committee will repre
sent all the frats, we will certainly pay
attention to it,"he said.
Robinson stressed his role in decid
ing whether the residences have "edu
cational value" as administrative,
rather than judicial, which may not be
entirely in line with the IFC's policing
capacity.
He remained somewhat skeptical of
the prospects for the plan's success,
stating, "I don't know how well it will
work, because of a history of a some
what weak IFC here."
Butler said the IFC has been weak,
but added that new membership re
quirements will eliminate much of the

problem. He said that this year's IFC
was burdened with lack of en
thusiasm. "After the bonfire failed,
everyone just lost interest," he
claimed.
Butler said he sees his role as IFC
president as that of an organizer and
coordinator of opinions and attitudes
within the fraternity system. Issues to
be considered next year are whether or
not to have the bonfire and how in
volved the IFC should be in promoting
sororities.
The IFC also elected Phi Delta Theta
member Peter McCook to be next
year's vice president, and Kappa
Alpha member Chuck Nelson for trea
surer.

been so severe if there had been an
arbitration board.
In minor disputes, the committee
will have power to fine the offending
party and assess it for damages. In
more severe incidents, the committee
will act in an advisory capacity to
Norm Robinson, associate dean of stu
dent affairs and James Lyons, dean of
student affairs.
A provision of the new constitution
calls for "perfection" of the committee
by Jan. 1, 1978. This means explicitly
spelling out its guidelines for frat con
duct and parameters of operation
under the Stanford Judicial Charter,
explained Schwartz.
"It is especially important to draw
the line between the action of an indi
vidual and the action of a house," he
said.
Robinson voiced approval for the
committee and the IFC's move toward
self-policing. He said the influence of
the IFC committee will depend on the
issue and the strength of its recom

mendation.
"Because the committee will repre
sent all the frats, we will certainly pay
attention to it,"he said.
Robinson stressed his role in decid
ing whether the residences have "edu
cational value" as administrative,
rather than judicial, which may not be
entirely in line with the IFC's policing
capacity.
He remained somewhat skeptical of
the prospects for the plan's success,
stating, "I don't know how well it will
work, because of a history of a some
what weak IFC here."
Butler said the IFC has been weak,
but added that new membership re
quirements will eliminate much of the

problem. He said that this year's IFC
was burdened with lack of en
thusiasm. "After the bonfire failed,
everyone just lost interest," he
claimed.
Butler said he sees his role as IFC
president as that of an organizer and
coordinator of opinions and attitudes
within the fraternity system. Issues to
be considered next year are whether or
not to have the bonfire and how in
volved the IFC should be in promoting
sororities.
The IFC also elected Phi Delta Theta
member Peter McCook to be next
year's vice president, and Kappa
Alpha member Chuck Nelson for trea
surer.
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
unanimously ratified a new constitu
tion and elected Theta Delta Chi
member Reid Butler president for the
next academic year in a meeting Mon
day afternoon.
The extensively-rewritten constitu
tion was passed in an effort to
strengthen the IFC and made it the sole
representative body of the fraternity
system, according to Jordan Schwartz,
former IFC president and author of the
new constitution.
The two major changes in the con
stitution will provide for mandatory
IFC membership for all house presi
dents and an IFC Arbitration Commit
tee to settle disputes within the frater
nity system.
Mandatory membership for house
presidents will increase the legitimacy
of the IFC by effectively forcing the
University to recognize it as the sole
representative of the frats, according to
Schwartz.
"In the past, the University has cir
cumvented the IFC by calling house
presidents' meetings. Now the presi
dents will be in the IFC, so it will be
come a more legitimate body in the
eyes of the frats and the University,"
said Schwartz.
"Having two bodies represent the
fraternity system was counterproduc
tive," he added.
The Arbitration Committee will
consist of the IFC president, two active

frat members, one frat house associate
(RA) and a member of the alumni IFC.
"The committee will make the frats
self-policing, so that we can handle
our own affairs without the University
jumping in," said Schwartz.
Creation of the committee follows
the University's decision last spring to
deny the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
group living privileges for this year.
Schwartz, a member of the Delts, said

been so severe if there had been an
