Some 63 more persons arrested in
the May 9 Old Union sit-in were ar
raigned yesterday in Palo Alto crimi
nal court, with the majority again ask
ing for a continuance until next week.
Yesterday, all 55 protesters who
signed citations on May 9 rather than
being taken to the Elmwood Correc
tional Facility in Milpitas were among
those arraigned.
Under a plea-bargaining deal of
fered by the district attorney's office
Monday, 10 of the citation-signing
protesters pleaded no contest. All were
put on six months probation, with no
fines levied against them. This is in

contrast to the $65 fine issued to pro
testers who refused to sign the citation
and enter guilty pleas.
One of the defenses being planned
by the protesters pleading not guilty is
to challenge the constitutionality of
one charge, according to defense
lawyer Ron Romines.
"There is the general issue as to First
Amendment rights," Romines said.
"And yes, there is a question of the
constitutionality of one of the of
fenses."
Romines declined to identify the
exact offense he was referring to.
"It's a real close case," Romines

said.
So far, however, the pleas of many
protesters have yet to be entered. Only
three of the 91 protesters arraigned so
far have pleaded not guilty.
According to protest leader Chris
Coleman, one of those arrested, this is
because talks with lawyers research
ing the case are still going on.
"I haven't had the time to do all of
the research yet," Romines said.
An undisclosed number of protes
ters failed to appear again yesterday.
Bench warrants of $100 will be issued
if they fail to appear in court by May
31.
