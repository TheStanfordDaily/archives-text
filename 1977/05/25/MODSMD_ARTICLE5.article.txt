The solution to crime is not to "hire
everyone a psychologist or to lock
everyone up," San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongisto said last night.
Instead, crime must be attacked as
an economic problem, the recently
jailed law enforcement official as
serted in a speech at Tresidder Union.
Hongisto emerged earlier this
month from a five-day jail term after
being convicted for contempt of court
when he refused to evict tenants from
San Francisco's International Hotel.
Hongisto said one only need iook at
the FBI crime reports to see the link
between crime and economics.
"Eighty-seven per cent of all re
ported crime is larceny involving
property while 13 per cent involves
aggressive violence," said Hongisto,
now in his second term as sheriff of
San Francisco.
He added that the aggressive vio

lence figure included armed robbery
so the reported larceny figure wasn't a
true indication of property crimes. The
larceny reported crimes also excluded
white collar crime because it is rarely
reported.
Hongisto cited several types of
crime committed largely by persons
with low economic standing.
Hardly any women arrested for pros
titution by the San Francisco police
department have come from the upper
middle or even middle classes, the
sheriff said.
Aiso, "it is usually not the affluent
gentleman who takes a pistol in hand
and tries to rob some place or pick
someone's pocket," said Hongisto.
"The problem is that most police
departments do not see crime as an
essentially economic phenomena," he
said.
Hongisto said the staff attorney ad
vised him that the courts could not
charge him with contempt of court,
because according to the law a sheriff
does not have to carry out an eviction.
Hongisto was told he could simply
send back the court order with a writ
ten explanation saying why he did not
want to carry it out.
He said outsiders did not know that
if the eviction was carried out, the
police would have to deal with the
Tenant Association, one of the most
effective interest groups in the coun
try.
"It was not just a matter of wheeling
out elderly tenants," said Hongisto.
Hongisto said he may have done
everyone a favor by not serving the
eviction notice because police did not
have enough men to cover all the exits
and the number of spectators sum
moned by the association eventually
could have caused people to be killed
needlessly.
