# Report to name errant landlords
## 
### Chris Wasney 
Fifteen landlords in the Midpeninsula area who
have been sued repeatedly will be named in a report
by a SWOPSI workshop on landlord-tenant relations
to be distributed throughout the campus today.
The suits have been for failure to return all or part
of tenants' security deposits when tenants leave the
dwelling.
The report, entitled "Off Campus Tenants: Land
lords to watch out for," exposes the problem of land
lords withholding deposits, and outlines procedures
for tenants to protect themselves against losing their
deposits, which run from $50 to $400.
Security deposits are often called "damage" or
"cleaning" deposits and are designed to protect the
landlord from default on rent payments and dam
aged or missing items. The deposits are supposed to
be returned in full, providing the tenant leaves the
dwelling undamaged and clean.
However, the report alleges that some landlords
attempt to avoid full repayment of the deposits by
assessing unfair damages, cleaning or maintenance
costs or by misrepresenting the deposits as not fully
refundable. All such deposits are fully refundable
under California state law.
Diane Van Schoten, a member of the workshop,
said, "somelandlords relyuponkeepingthesecurity
deposits to make their money, because rent prices
are more or less determined by the market."
Landlords named in the report have been sued
from three to 16 times since Jan. 1, 1975. When the
Daily attempted to contact Maurice Broner, the land
lord with the most suits against him (16), his wife
replied he was "indisposed."
One landlord cited, L. Burt Averv, did comment
onthe report, saying that the suits against him werea

result of disputes over damages and missing items.
He said disputes were a common problem because
of the deposit system, but that many are settled be
fore reaching small claims court. He said more suits
were filed against him (14) because he owns many
units in comparison to other landlords.
The report outlines two alternatives for tenants
who fear they may not recover their security deposit:
rent withholding and suit in small claims court.
Rent withholding involves deducting the amount
of the deposit from the last regular rent check before
vacating the dwelling. This is a sure way to retain the
deposit, but it could entail legal action by the land
lord, the report says.
A suit in small claims court involves more time
and trouble, but punitive damages up to $200 can be
collected in addition to the deposit, if "bad faith" on
the part of the landlord can be proved.
The SWOPSI course, entitled "Tenant-Landlord
relations: A Midpeninsula perspective," was taught
by Dave Brown, a graduate student in applied earth
sciences. He said his own hassles with a landlord
when he worked for Consumer's United in Palo Alto
inspired him to initiate the workshop.
"At first, the workshop was only going to furnish a
list of landlords who had been sued, but it evolved
into a full-scale report," said Brown.
The impetus for that evolution was provided by
the students, some of whom had experienced land
lord disputes in the past, and who realized the rele
vance of the issue to the many Stanford students who
live off-campus.
Other students in the workshop were Kevin Col
eman, Kelly Francis. Mike Moore, Tom Prussing and
Dave Zarka.
