"The unique strength of Ameri
can higher education...has been
its ecumenical quality, its effort
to bridge the gap between
Academia and the world of prac
tical affairs. This is a heritage we
would be foolish to lose in the
heat of some sham battle over
what higher education is all ab
out. It is about the mind...and
about coping with the real
world."
-President Richard Lyman
'Why Stanford?', 1976
With the ever-reliable police,
the University has again estab
lished the business/profit thing
over the education/people thing.
Again we learn that the Univer
sity is owned by its head and not
its unruly body.
We also learn, thanks largely
to the body, that the University
owns stock in several corpora
tions which, in the turn of
things, have holdings in South
Africa. Now while I agree with
President Richard Lyman that it
is risky for universities to "act as
political bodies" and make polit
ical statements about outside is
sues (Campus Report, May 18),
apartheid is an in-house issue. In
Lyman's terms the University
has taken an ecumenical interest
in the world of practical affairs
in South Africa. Moreover, the
standard trustee defense of this
interest is that we may be able to
use our capital to do good over
there, i.e., we can and we do take
a stand as a social-corporate-

policed-political-educational
corpus. This is why I am puzzled
by what Lyman is reported to
have said the Ninth Senate of the
Academic Council:
"If universities become politi
cally active there will be no lack
of people willing to join in polit
ical action, but...there is no
reason to suppose that those who
win political control of univer
sities will be good for those in
stitutions."
Does Lyman honestly believe
that those who have already won
political control of this univer
sity are, because they already
are, good for it? I too cherish the
University and grant it a being
beyond the individuals who
comprise it, but I believe the best
way to run and preserve it is
through a more democratic rule,
not rule largely by a few very
successful businesspersons.
The issue is apartheid and the
existence of a bridge linking this
university with apartheid. A re
lated issue is the instant break
down of what democratic forms
there are around here whenever
the whim of the students con
flicts with the wisdom of the
trustees.
In these times Lyman des
cribes as dominated by student
concern with "...careers, money,
money careers...," Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig has done his dam
nest to return us to those radi
cally tense days when "...not

George Cattermole

(sic) everybody was throwing
bombs." Thus far he has been ar
rogant and condescending with
the Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) and friends and told
them to get out.
In the preceding quote from
the Stanford Observer, Lyman
fails to mention Vietnam and the
University's connections there
with. Why?
To begin the implementation
of a consensus forming and find
ing apparatus here, I suggest that
a process be designed and depo
sited in the University Rules and
Regulations whereby:
A petition signed by more
than one-fourth of the Stanford
family would initiate the forma
tion of a president-appointed,
representative, fair...committee
charged with working the con
cerns of the petitions into resolu
tions. If these resolutions are de
termined to be constitutional in
California and the United States,
then the Stanford family votes.
Any resolution getting two

thirds or more of the vote be
comes the case.
These are rough and simple
suggestions. How would the
alumni be included? Why two
thirds? More important, should
the president have the power to
veto?
I note that in his Report of the
Provost, William Miller has an
nounced "...that he has ap
pointed a steering committee or
working group to consider the
question of establishing a prog
ram inpublic policy..." (Campus
Report, May 18). Perhaps this is a
first step toward what I am
suggesting. If so, a second is
needed—one which involves the
recognition that public policy is
something that should be demo
cratically determined. I there
fore call upon Lyman to set this
in motion by appointing a com
mittee whose charge shall be to
draw up one-person/one-vote re
ferendum procedures.

in undergraduate studies.)

-President Richard Lyman
'Why Stanford?', 1976
With the ever-reliable police,
the University has again estab
lished the business/profit thing
over the education/people thing.
Again we learn that the Univer
sity is owned by its head and not
its unruly body.
We also learn, thanks largely
to the body, that the University
owns stock in several corpora
tions which, in the turn of
things, have holdings in South
Africa. Now while I agree with
President Richard Lyman that it
is risky for universities to "act as
political bodies" and make polit
ical statements about outside is
sues (Campus Report, May 18),
apartheid is an in-house issue. In
Lyman's terms the University
has taken an ecumenical interest
in the world of practical affairs
in South Africa. Moreover, the
standard trustee defense of this
interest is that we may be able to
use our capital to do good over
there, i.e., we can and we do take
a stand as a social-corporate-

policed-political-educational
corpus. This is why I am puzzled
by what Lyman is reported to
have said the Ninth Senate of the
Academic Council:
"If universities become politi
cally active there will be no lack
of people willing to join in polit
ical action, but...there is no
reason to suppose that those who
win political control of univer
sities will be good for those in
stitutions."
Does Lyman honestly believe
that those who have already won
political control of this univer
sity are, because they already
are, good for it? I too cherish the
University and grant it a being
beyond the individuals who
comprise it, but I believe the best
way to run and preserve it is
through a more democratic rule,
not rule largely by a few very
successful businesspersons.
The issue is apartheid and the
existence of a bridge linking this
university with apartheid. A re
lated issue is the instant break
down of what democratic forms
there are around here whenever
the whim of the students con
flicts with the wisdom of the
trustees.
In these times Lyman des
cribes as dominated by student
concern with "...careers, money,
money careers...," Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig has done his dam
nest to return us to those radi
cally tense days when "...not

George Cattermole

(sic) everybody was throwing
bombs." Thus far he has been ar
rogant and condescending with
the Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) and friends and told
them to get out.
In the preceding quote from
the Stanford Observer, Lyman
fails to mention Vietnam and the
University's connections there
with. Why?
To begin the implementation
of a consensus forming and find
ing apparatus here, I suggest that
a process be designed and depo
sited in the University Rules and
Regulations whereby:
A petition signed by more
than one-fourth of the Stanford
family would initiate the forma
tion of a president-appointed,
representative, fair...committee
charged with working the con
cerns of the petitions into resolu
tions. If these resolutions are de
termined to be constitutional in
California and the United States,
then the Stanford family votes.
Any resolution getting two

thirds or more of the vote be
comes the case.
These are rough and simple
suggestions. How would the
alumni be included? Why two
thirds? More important, should
the president have the power to
veto?
I note that in his Report of the
Provost, William Miller has an
nounced "...that he has ap
pointed a steering committee or
working group to consider the
question of establishing a prog
ram inpublic policy..." (Campus
Report, May 18). Perhaps this is a
first step toward what I am
suggesting. If so, a second is
needed—one which involves the
recognition that public policy is
something that should be demo
cratically determined. I there
fore call upon Lyman to set this
in motion by appointing a com
mittee whose charge shall be to
draw up one-person/one-vote re
