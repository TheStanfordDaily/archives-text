# Deficiencies called 'common'
## Med Center defended

The number of California Administrative code viola
tions cited in a state Department of Health report on the
Stanford Hospital is not excessive, according to Tom
Callahan, a health department official.
Callahan met with hospital officials last Friday to dis
cuss the 43 violations cited in the report. Five of the
violations were deleted immediately because they were
found to be invalid or already corrected, Callahan said.
Other violations cited in the report include: 1) lack of
bed space; 2) lack of storage space; 3) no clear separation
of "dirty" and "clean" areas in the hospital; 4) unlocked
pharmacy doors; 5) problems with medical records; and
6) inadequate food service and sanitation problems
while transferring food from one building to another.
Peter Levin, associate vice president for medical af
fairs, said action is already being taken to correct the
problems. He outlined proposed solutions for some
major problems:
—A new intensive care unit is being opened to relieve
congestion in the old one. The intensive care unit for
newborn babies is being remodeled to provide more
room. Other areas where space problems were sighted
cannot be altered because of architectural problems and
the state cannot ask the hospital to do so in these areas.
—A new addition, now almost completed, will al
leviate storage problems. A renovation of the central
sterile supply will provide adequate storage for such
supplies.

—The hospital is now in compliance with all regula
tions for drug storage. The pharmacy is locked at all
times when it is unattended, and records now reflect the
fact that only registered nurses remove drugs from the
pharmacy after hours.
—"Dirty" and "clean" areas have been separated al
though it is unlikely that "dirty" and "clean" materials
came into contact prior to the partitioning of the main
loading dock and adjacent hallway. Refuse bins have
been improved.
—Medical record delinquencies (thos 5 records which
have not been signed by the attending physician within
two weeks of a patient's discharge) have been reduced
from the 2510 cited in the report to around 400, a low
figure for a hospital of this size, according to Levin.
—There will be an increase in the food services. A
microwave oven system will be installed in Hoover
Pavilion and all previous problems with transporting
food from the main building to Hoover will thus be
eliminated.
Levin stressed that "nowhere was the quality of care
questioned" by the state's report, a feeling echoed by
Callahan. Levin added "This is a very clean hospital as
hospitals go."
Callahan said the hospital must submit a program of
action for rectifying the remaining code violations by
June 20. Except for architectural problems, he said, he
does not foresee problems with eventual compliance in
any area.
