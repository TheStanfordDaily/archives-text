Dear Duca,
I'm unable to decide whether
strangers who gaze orstareat me
think I'm lovable, sexy or ugly
and sexless. It happens whether
the stranger is female or male,
young or old. I'm 25, male, fairly
attractive, a little sexy and I'm
not dirty or dumb. Perhaps I feel
this way with strangers because
I'm shy. My question to you is,
should 1 test my fantasies by ac
costing a stranger and asking
what they think of me or should
I drop the whole exciting delu
sion.
Stumped
Dear "Stumped,"
I shouldn't care a bit if people
stare at me, unless I were really
"dirty or dumb" — which you
obviously are not — and cer
tainly I wouldn't "test my fan
tasies" in accosting a stranger to
ask him or her what they are
thinking of me.
Just be your usual self, act
normally, play it by ear.

Dear Duca,
I address this problem to you
because you are older and wiser
than my 27 years. I seem unable
to shake a severe self
consciousness when among
strangers. Although it seems to

be lessening with age, still,
sometimes it's so intense my
breathing comes shorter and my
throat Jumps. I've asked friends
and they too have similar sensa
tions. Is self-consciousness
okay? Or should 1 take some ac
tion to overcome it? Please ad
vise.

Dear Stranger,
I quite understand your feel
ing of self-consciousness when
among strangers, for I was the
same in my teens.
Indeed it will lessen with age,
but you must fight against it
NOW, because not only is it a
negative attitude, but this in
feriority complex gives a wrong
impression of your real person
ality. You are neither more nor
less than the same thinking and
feeling human being, no matter
whom you are facing.
Hence, be yourself quietly,
unobstrusively, with a dash of
humor, if possible. BE IN
TERESTED in the person you are
talking to, ask questions, create a
normal human contact.
In acting this way you will be
come by slow degrees less self
conscious, eventually switching
your attention from yourself to
whoever you are encountering.
Good Luck!
