### 
The new KZSU staff for 1977-78 has announced
plans to upgrade its public affairs programming
for the upcoming year.
Recruitment of new staff is the main emphasis of
the plan, according to Peter Necarsulmer, disc
jockey and producer of KZSU News' "30 Mi
nutes," and Lonnie Rosenwald who will co-direct
the Public Affairs department. Necarsulmer will
make a special effort to recruit women and
graduate students, he said.
In order to encourage people with little or no
experience to work in public affairs programming,
Necarsulmer will begin training new staffers this
summer. A special meeting will be held on Tues
day, May 31 at 8 p.m. in the Graduate School of
Business, room 82.
Next year's format will cover many of the cur

rently featured topics such as minority affairs, en
tertainment and consumer issues. Rosenwald
hopes to initiate new programs covering current
events, radio drama and comedy, she said.
"Many graduate students stay away from the
station because they feel it's the domain of under
graduates, but they are the greatest untapped re
source in the University," said Necarsulmer.
"We hope that by appealing to the many seg
ments of the Stanford community we will increase
not only the scope of programming but the diver
sity of next year's staff," said Rosenwald.
"Creativity and a good idea are more important
than actual radio experience, Rosenwald con
tinued. "We are willing to train anybody in the
skills of compiling and eingineering a radio
show," she added.
