## ballet/julianne koehne Provincialism in evidence in S.F. Ballet 
### 
The last program of the San
Francisco Ballet's season in
cludes Balanchine's neo-classic,
Symphony in C, and after its per
formance of this masterpiece last
Saturday, the company received
a standing ovation, but for the
wrong reasons.
t his abstract ballet has been
heralded by the press for its
technical precision, as "the
epitome of intricate and precise
dancing," but the ballet is more
than a series of pleasing geomet
rical shapes in uniform rhythm.
Having choreographed it
especially for the Paris Opera
company in 1949, Balanchine
had recognized the inner drive
and momentum of Bizet's score
and crafted a fluid, visual clarifi
cation of the music, which, al
though a distillation of related
groups of movements, derived
from the flavor of the music. The
dance uses music as a
spingboard only and the deeper
undercurrents of the music sup
ply emotional overtones.
If technique only is regarded
as important, audiences would
be justified in calling Symphony
in C a pointe class set to music.
Should anyone have the vulgar
temerity to assume that precise
togetherness can be exploited,
he should recall the noted con
versation between Lincoln kirs
tein, head of the New York City
Ballet and patroness-of-the-arts,
Lady Avon. "What 1 really want
to know is why your dancers
can't keep in step?" the latter
asked. The former replied that he
felt "keeping in step implies a
Rockette type of paramilitary
discipline, whereas most of our
core choreography is insistently
contrapuntal phrasing, delib
erate imbalance, syncopation,
and calculated offbeats."
Energetic brushes
In Symphony in C each of the
four movements develops a diffe
rent melody and has its own
dancers to explore the various
themes. In the first movement,
allegro vivo, two groups of
women dance together with the
opening chord and then dance in
opposition, alternately follow
ing the two leaders in energetic
brushes of the feet pointing in
different directions in low posi
tions. The ballerina enters as the
second theme is announced and

then two soloists dance, sup
ported by two men. In the second
adagio movement, the corps
moves more slowly and the bal
lerina's dance is softer. Betsy
Erickson received roses for her
principal role here, but l find her
aloof, vague stares ungenerous
— her joy is too immanently
self-contained for her to share it
with us. But Laurie Cowden in a
solo role again drew my atten
tion; her warm gaze and direct
communication were what I had
noticed most when I first saw the
San Francisco Ballet do Agon in
January.
The third and fourth move
ments, allegro vivace, climax
with the entire corps dancing
around all four ballerinas and
their partners. Although the
principal roles are performed
exubeiantly, the corps sets the
mood and pulse. 1 missed an
awareness on the part of the in
dividual members of the im
petus behind even the most basic
movement, such as pointing
the foot repeatedly or crossing
the legs on pointe in various
shades of plasticity.
Symphony in C abounds with
elementary actions which
should not be boring to watch. It
is up to the dancers to make
these so-called elementary, clas
sroom exercise exciting, but
their torsos, necks and arms are
too wooden to project the theat
ricality necessary to transform
geometry into art.
Provincialism
It's not that the company
should adopt every mannerism

of New York City Ballet's dan
cers, but there are certain re
finements, such as the dynamics
of the attack of the feet on the
out-movement, which students
at Balanchine's school learn so
that they can perform his ballets
better than anyone else. The San
Francisco dancers need coach
ing — would an orchestra per
form a work it had ijever heard?
Must the price of provincialism
be self-satisfaction?
The company also performed
Moves, choreographed by
NYCB's co-choreographer
Jerome Robbins and first pre
sented in 1959. In contrast to
Symphony In C's abstract musi
cal design, its theme is connec
tions and severances of relation
ships. In stark silence, the inter
weaving of emotions conveyed
by movements alone seems se
vere and jarring. It's an honor for
the company's first Robbins
piece to be one which depends
on the dancers alone and they
fulfill this responsibility beyond
the call of technique.
In single file across the back of
the stage, dressed in practice
clothes, 10 dancers approach us
projecting an atmosphere of sav
age, sullen awareness. At the
end they leave in the same way.
Moves' characters are pawns on
a game-board, for they can only
be themselves — they cannot
choose to reveal superficial im
ages.
Hell
There is action, but no choice;
in Sartre's words, hell is other
people (enfer, e'est les autres)

when our self images cannot es
cape from or he disguised from
other people's offensive objec
tivity. All we see are their pre
sent selves; without music we
must sense the previous move
ment's emotion during transi
tions, and therefore we can only
be guided by and predict from
what has happened.
Lacking accompaniment, the
action of a man turning a woman
around on pointe with her leg
extended in back of her seems
harsh and manipulative. The
only noises we hear are from the
feet; without the orchestra to
muffle them, those pink pointe
shoes, usually made toappear so
comfortable and to display the
femine foot so softly and sensu
ously, drive and jab like steel
into the ground, while the only
retorts are the blunter stampings
from the men's softer shoes.
Lew Christensen's and
Michael Smuin's choreographic
personalities complement each
other; while Christensen under
states, Smuin almost overstates
in his desire to draw a passionate
response. Christensen's Diver
tissement d' Auber (1959) is
frothy entertinament with no
purpose other than the delight of
watching the virtuosic pointe
work of Diana Weber and Susan
Magno and the powerful hatterie
of David McNaughton.
Thighs
The surprise of the evening
was David McNaughton's
emergence as a dcinseur noble;
his thick thighs and stocky build
would have placed him only in

character roles, but his elegance
and pure breadth of line have
made him a classicist. His pow
erful legs are necessary to exe
cute Christensen's demanding
choreography, but at the points
of suspension during a series of
leaps with his feet tucked under
him, he exhibited not arrogant
athleticism, but a single, breath
less joy of civilized excitement.
Smuin's Songs of MahJer
(1976), true to his concept of
Mahler's texts, explores not
"conventional Romanticism, but
traumatic Realism." Eight selec
tions from Mahler's Songs of a
Wayfarer and Des Knciben
Wunderhorn display moods
ranging from Victoria Ciorfi's
playfulness to Anita Faciotti's
sexuality. Ostensibly, the indi
vidual talents of the S.F. ballet's
dancers are being used but Smu
tin seems to restrict them by now
to narrow stereotypes.
Clearly Songs of MohJer suc
ceeds in bringing us closer to
dancers as people and this is not
traumatic in the least. Vane Vest
is divine in mauve, but if he and
the other men of the company
could control their buttock mus
cles and not turn in their stand
ing legs for pirhouettes the com
pany's technique as a whole
would be stronger.
