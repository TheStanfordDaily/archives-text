Singer-guitarist Bonnie Raitt and blues-man
8.8. King will appear together in a special
Memorial Day concert in Frost Amphitheater.
From a musical family 'leaded by Broadway
singer John Raitt, star of "Carousel" and
"Pajama Game" (to name only two), Bonnie
picked up the guitar at the age of 12 and was on
her way toward mastering a unique country
blues style, derived from listening to recordings
by Robert Johnson, Mississippi John Hurt,
Muddy Waters and John Hammond. While born
and raised in the Los Angeles area, Bonnie
gravitated East for college, entering the Cam
bridge scene in 1967 when venues like the Club
47 nourished a healthy folk and blues scene.
Within a few years, she took a leave of absence
to work for the American Friends Service
Committee in Philadelphia and soon gave in to
the impetus to take her guitar and distinctive
blues interpretations on stage. ("It was better
than typing and I liked the hours," she remem
bers.)
Initial success in Philadelphia and Boston
area clubs led to subsequent engagements at the
Gaslite in New York, Philadelphia's Main
Point, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, and
numerous colleges on the East Coast.
Off to an impressive start, Bonnie was soon
privileged to share the stage with many of her
long-time blues idols. Thanks to the introduc-

Tory efforts of Dick Waterman, who's managed
most of the blues musicians alive during the
past 10 years, she played and learned from Son
House, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Arthur
Crudup, Howlin' Wolf, and her special mentor,
Sippie Wallace. As her audiences and versatil
ity grew, she drew the interest of record com
panies.
Fans initially attracted by Bonnie's blues per
formances weren't dismayed with her debut al
bum, Bonnie Raitt. The program included tradi
tional material from Robert Johnson and Sippie
Wallaceand included performances by Chicago
bluesmen Junior Wells and A.C. Reed. The
album also covered a range of styles that would
become a Bonnie Raitt tradition — a mixture of
country blues, early rhythm and blues, interpre
tations of material by new songwriters as well
as original compositions.
Her other albums include Give it up, Takin'
My Time, Sweetlights, Home Plate and Sweet
Forgiveness.
8.8. King is a renowned master of the blues
guitar. His early influences were Blind Lemon
Jefferson, Leroy Carr and Lonnie Johnson. It is
their vocal styles which he imitates, duplicat
ing the "worry" which they put into their lyrics.
Tickets, $5.50 for Stanford students, $6.50
general admission, and $7.50 day of the show,
are available at the Tresidder Union Box Office.
