# Eagles, Steve Miller to be at two Days on the Green
## 
### 
The accent will be on sunshine, mass hu
manity and superstar rock'n'roll once again
this weekend, as Bill Graham holds forth
with Days on the Green two and three this
Saturday and Monday at the Oakland Col
iseum. This weekend's line-up features The
Eagles, The Steve Miller Hand and Heart.
Both shows will offer the same acts.
All three of the headliners in this program
are riding high on the crest of extremely
popular recent record releases. The Eagles'
latest offering, Hotel California, is steadily
climbing the charts, and promises yet
another bundle for these million-dollar
babies of country-rock. Most of the cuts off
Hotel California follow the same formula
which was responsible for catapulting the
Eagles to success at their inception: easy
country rhythms, melodic harmonies, and
nicely-rhyming lyrics. Undoubtedly, Hotel
California will account for a large portion of
the Eagles' repertoire, as well as such old
favorites as "Peaceful, Easy Feeling," "Take
It Easy," and"The Best of My Love."
Steve Miller, Texas' second-biggest con

tribution to rock music next to Boz Scaggs,
brings his band to the Green in something of
a triumph. Miller's latest album, Fly Like an
Eagle (oh, how Miller wishes he was the
top-billed act), has propelled the band to the
brink of super-stardom, or beyond â€” de
pending on the age of the rock fan rendering
an opinion. Miller's music is outrageously
simple,repetitive, and irresistably engaging,
with a characteristic hard-driving bass-line
which will have the stadium rocking. What
Miller may lack in musical prowess, he more
than makes up for in his stage presence, cap
turing the audience's spirit in the manner of
Marjoe. His back-up band is strong, and
compliments his style.
The most exciting of all the headlining
acts this weekend is Heart, a newcomer to
the popular rock 'n' roll scene. Heart is bask
ing in the glory of a series of AM hits which
has brought it popular notoriety. And
most interestingly, this Canadian ensemble
achieved their success without going
through the conventional music industry
channels. In their first major Bay Area ap

pearance, Heart should provide a rousing
performance.
The Atlanta Rhythm Section and
Foreigner will round out both days. And by
the way, if it's raining, bring a tarp.
