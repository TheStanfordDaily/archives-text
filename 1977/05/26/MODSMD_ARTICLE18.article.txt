The American Conservatory Theater will
present a limited two week engagement of
the Dance Theater of Harlem, described as
"classical ballet with soul," June 14 to 26 at
the Geary Theater. Tickets go on sale to the
general public May 31.
Dance Theater of Harlem was founded in
1969 by Arthur Mitchell, premier danseur
with the New York City Ballet for 15 years
and the first black dancer in the nation to
become a leading member of a major ballet
company. Born and raised in Harlem, Mitch
ell created its first classically oriented ballet
school as his personal commitment to the
black community following Martin Luther
Kings' assassination.
