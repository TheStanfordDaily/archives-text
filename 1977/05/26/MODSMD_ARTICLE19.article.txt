## Buddy Rich keeps swing era alive 
### 
When the big bands of the
swing era washed out in the
mid-19405, Buddy Rich neither
quit swinging, nor drowned in
nostalgia. He formed a big band,
put his drum set in front and
dragged the swing era into the
'50s, '60s and '70s.
Driving, fast and loud, Buddy
Rich and the Big Band Machine
fired through a set of swinging
jazz at the packed Bold Knight in
Sunnyvale. It was a rare experi
ence; the days of Goodman, El
lington, Dorsey, Shaw, Basieand
Miller are forgotten for the most
part.
The swing era was the only
time in history when jazz and
popular music were one. The
key to the era was communica
tion. Leaders had to "feel" a
crowd and call appropriate
charts for the dancers and listen
ers. It was spontaneous. A good
leader would sometimes call bal
lad after ballad if he thought the
crowd was in a particularly
romantic mood.
Rich called the show on the
spot. He opened each tune by
setting the tempo on his hi-hat.
As the band played, it seemed to
be constantly pushed forward,
building momentum. When one
member of the band soloed, all
15 others listened. Then they
played or soloed with the new
feeling. They worked off each
other and the arrangements
grew.
Five limbs
The man doing the pushing
was Rich. He is the most inspir
ing drummer in the world, driv
ing a four-beat swing pattern to
its peak and then cutting right
across it with triplet figures
played by what seems to be a
fifth limb. His fills and solos are
unparalleled in speed and inde
pendent coordination.
Count Basie once hired Rich to
replace his sick drummer at the
Palladium in Hollywood. "We
asked Buddy to play again the
next night and you know what
happened? The entire band
showed up early for work. Now,
you know that was just about
unheard of in that band," Basie
said later.
Rich had been known for mak
ing bands jump since his Artie
Shaw days. He started in vau
deville, at seven years old, play
ing drums, singing and tap
dancing. He played with Joe

Marsala in New York and then
Bunny Berigan's band, until
1938, when he joined Shaw. In
1940, Tommy Dorsey hired Rich.
Rich's drumming is loud and
when he was young, the volume
level rested just beneath over
powering. His ego, however,
soared way off the scale. When
he joined Dorsey, he met another
newcomer, Frank Sinatra. The
two of them did a lot of swing
ing, on and off stage.
Rich would occasionally add
"inspirational" rim-shots and
thuds during Sinatra's delicate,
mood-filled ballads. In the
kitchen of the Astor Roof in New
York, an autograph marked a
missing chunk of plaster where a
pitcher filled with ice, thrown by
Sinatra, missed Rich.
Though they feuded, Sinatra
respected and admired Rich's
ability and later backed a big

band he formed. He also hired
Rich's band to tour with him in
1967.
Sidemen
Rich's Big Band Machine fea
tured several excellent sidemen.
Pianist Barry Kiner played a long
trio spot brilliantly. He pro
ceeded through a number of
ideas, linking each one, while
Rich maintained subtle brush
work. At one point, Kiner began
exchanging four bars with him
self using two different styles.
Tenor saxophonist Steve Mar
kus wowed everyone, including
Rich, with a wild, hard-blowing
funk solo which lasted several
minutes completely unaccom
panied. Trumpets Dean Pratt
and Ross Ponitoff, and tenor
flutist Bobby Mincer also played
several energetic solos.
Rich played only short solos
and fills until the last piece

when he let go for over five mi
nutes. The crowd (and the band)
watched motionless as the little
guy with the monkeyish grin
maintained a roll with his left
hand and counter rhythms with
his other hand and both feet.
Rich's drum set consisted only of
snare, bass, hi-hat, several cym
bals, one mounted tom-tom, and
two floor toms, one of which
served only as a table. He didn't
need much.
He began a long, low roll
which decrescendoed to almost
nothing. Then it grew, louder
and louder, until the drum shook
more than his wrists. The band
came back for one final blast and
the ovation was already in prog
ress.
When the crowd eventually
quieted, Rich leaned to a mike
and said, "I wanna thank you.
It's really deserved." He was
right.

kitchen of the Astor Roof in New
York, an autograph marked a
missing chunk of plaster where a
pitcher filled with ice, thrown by
Sinatra, missed Rich.
Though they feuded, Sinatra
respected and admired Rich's
ability and later backed a big

band he formed. He also hired
Rich's band to tour with him in
1967.
Sidemen
Rich's Big Band Machine fea
tured several excellent sidemen.
Pianist Barry Kiner played a long
trio spot brilliantly. He pro
ceeded through a number of
ideas, linking each one, while
Rich maintained subtle brush
work. At one point, Kiner began
exchanging four bars with him
self using two different styles.
Tenor saxophonist Steve Mar
kus wowed everyone, including
Rich, with a wild, hard-blowing
funk solo which lasted several
minutes completely unaccom
panied. Trumpets Dean Pratt
and Ross Ponitoff, and tenor
flutist Bobby Mincer also played
several energetic solos.
Rich played only short solos
and fills until the last piece

when he let go for over five mi
nutes. The crowd (and the band)
watched motionless as the little
guy with the monkeyish grin
maintained a roll with his left
hand and counter rhythms with
his other hand and both feet.
Rich's drum set consisted only of
snare, bass, hi-hat, several cym
bals, one mounted tom-tom, and
two floor toms, one of which
served only as a table. He didn't
need much.
He began a long, low roll
which decrescendoed to almost
nothing. Then it grew, louder
and louder, until the drum shook
more than his wrists. The band
came back for one final blast and
the ovation was already in prog
ress.
When the crowd eventually
quieted, Rich leaned to a mike
and said, "I wanna thank you.
It's really deserved." He was
right.
When the big bands of the
swing era washed out in the
mid-19405, Buddy Rich neither
quit swinging, nor drowned in
nostalgia. He formed a big band,
put his drum set in front and
dragged the swing era into the
'50s, '60s and '70s.
Driving, fast and loud, Buddy
Rich and the Big Band Machine
fired through a set of swinging
jazz at the packed Bold Knight in
Sunnyvale. It was a rare experi
ence; the days of Goodman, El
lington, Dorsey, Shaw, Basieand
Miller are forgotten for the most
part.
The swing era was the only
time in history when jazz and
popular music were one. The
key to the era was communica
tion. Leaders had to "feel" a
crowd and call appropriate
charts for the dancers and listen
ers. It was spontaneous. A good
leader would sometimes call bal
lad after ballad if he thought the
crowd was in a particularly
romantic mood.
Rich called the show on the
spot. He opened each tune by
setting the tempo on his hi-hat.
As the band played, it seemed to
be constantly pushed forward,
building momentum. When one
member of the band soloed, all
15 others listened. Then they
played or soloed with the new
feeling. They worked off each
other and the arrangements
grew.
Five limbs
The man doing the pushing
was Rich. He is the most inspir
ing drummer in the world, driv
ing a four-beat swing pattern to
its peak and then cutting right
across it with triplet figures
played by what seems to be a
fifth limb. His fills and solos are
unparalleled in speed and inde
pendent coordination.
Count Basie once hired Rich to
replace his sick drummer at the
Palladium in Hollywood. "We
asked Buddy to play again the
next night and you know what
happened? The entire band
showed up early for work. Now,
you know that was just about
unheard of in that band," Basie
said later.
Rich had been known for mak
ing bands jump since his Artie
Shaw days. He started in vau
deville, at seven years old, play
ing drums, singing and tap
dancing. He played with Joe

Marsala in New York and then
Bunny Berigan's band, until
1938, when he joined Shaw. In
1940, Tommy Dorsey hired Rich.
Rich's drumming is loud and
when he was young, the volume
level rested just beneath over
powering. His ego, however,
soared way off the scale. When
he joined Dorsey, he met another
newcomer, Frank Sinatra. The
two of them did a lot of swing
ing, on and off stage.
Rich would occasionally add
"inspirational" rim-shots and
thuds during Sinatra's delicate,
mood-filled ballads. In the
kitchen of the Astor Roof in New
York, an autograph marked a
missing chunk of plaster where a
pitcher filled with ice, thrown by
Sinatra, missed Rich.
