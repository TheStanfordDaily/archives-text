# Hospital employes charge discrimination
## 
### Bill Burger 
Large numbers of employes at the
Stanford Hospital and Medical Center
have complained for years of the unfair
treatment they have received while
working there.
The employes, a majority of whom
are minority workers in the house
keeping and dietary departments, con
tinually level charges of "racism,"
"harassment," "false accusation" and
"discrimination" against supervisors
and hospital officials.
In addition, workers speak critically
of the grievance hearing system. Ab
raham Sule, a foreign student at the
College of Notre Dame and a former
employe said, "They (Stanford) make

it look like they have a grievance
channel, but they don't.
"The same person who charges you
with something is on your grievance
committee."
Another problem centers around the
United Stanford Employees (USE) or
ganizers and the constant pressure put
on them by supervisors who fear they
will enlist union members from the
large group of workers who are not
USE members.
O.V. Hines, a USE steward and
housekeeping department employe
who has filed numerous grievances
against the University, said Medical
Center administrators are "after me
just because I'm a union man."

Hines spoke of the reluctance of
workers to approach him about their
problems because they fear supervisor
retaliation. "A lot of workers come to
ask me questions," said Hines, "but
they're always looking over their
shoulder."
In place of unionization, the hospi
tal administration allowed two com
mittees to organize to deal with the
problems of minority workers. These
committees, La Alianza for chicano
workers and the Black Advisory
Committee, have since found them
selves unable to confront the administ
ration when dealing with employe
problems.
Verbal attacks on the employe rela
tions at the hospital abound. Hines cal-'
led the hospital "the most racist place
I've worked in my 27 years in Califor
nia. They just don't hear the chicanos
and the blacks."
According to Sule, "They make it
sound like there is employe relations
but it's not like that at Stanford. What
ever your supervisor says is final. They
treat the employes like animals."
Sule added, "In housekeeping they
treat you terribly; they just want you to
follow the shepherd (supervisor)
whether he's going into the fire or not.
No sane person would want to work for
Stanford â€” they drive you crazy."

Olga Guerra, a hospital employe and
the only officially designated interpre
ter for Spanish-speaking patients and
workers, said the University's talk of
affirmative action is "a slap in the face
to chicanos because they (the Univer
sity) only employ them for housekeep
ing work."
There are no chicanos in the ad
ministration and very few supervisors,
accordi ng to Guerra. "We see their true
intentions by what they do, not by
what is written on paper," she said.
Guerra says that many workers come
to La Alianza with problems but that
the group just can't deal with the Uni
versity as a union could.
Ron Twomey, director of personnel
at the Medical Center, said last night,
"It is safe to say that Stanford has a
very good affirmative action program.
We're very proud of the program
here."
Paul Hofmann, director of the Stan
ford hospital and clinics, noted that
the recent opinions survey conducted
in the hospital was conducted to find
the problems existing there.
Hofmann said, "I feel we are becom
ing increasingly sensitive to the needs
of employes. This is not because of one
group, but because of the respon
sibilities we have in aiding progres
sive management."
