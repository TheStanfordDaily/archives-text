terday in the semifinals of the
NCAA tennis tournament in
Athens, Ga.

matches and will face second
seeded Trinity University of Texas
in today's finals.
"I think beating UCLA was a tre
mendous achievement," said coach
Dick Gould in a telephone inter
view last night. "We are the only
team in the country who has beaten
them and we've beaten them twice.
But it doesn't mean all that much
unless we can win tomorrow."

UCLA when we played them at

Stanford, but today we did it right."
"It's just one match. The guys
know the season's not over until
after the singles and doubles indi

excited over the UCLA win nor can
we get totally excited over an
NCAA team championship. There's
more competition to come."

Austin-Nichols downed Peter
Rennert-Hodges, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4.
"We've got to play that well to
morrow," Gould said. "We lost our
first two singles matches against
UCLA when we played them at

Stanford, but today we did it right."
"It's just one match. The guys
know the season's not over until
after the singles and doubles indi
vidual championships. We can't get
excited over the UCLA win nor can
we get totally excited over an
NCAA team championship. There's
more competition to come."
Today's matchup against Trinity
is as follows:
Mitchell v. Tony Giammalva;
Maze v. Larry Cottfried (last year's
No. 1 junior player and top frosh
prospect); Wright v. Erick Iskersky;
Hodges v. Ben McKown; Rast v.
Eddie Reese (the two are neighbors
in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and close
childhood friends); Bourne v. Mike
Davidson.
In doubles: Mitchell-Wright v.
Giammalva-Gottfried; Rast-Maze v.
Iskersky and Rennert-Hodges v.
Benson-Reese.
"The guys feel Trinity shouldn't
be ranked ahead of us," Gould said.
"They have been all year. We've got
to prove they shouldn't be ahead of
us.
The Cards lost to Trinity earlier in
the year at the National Intercol
legiate Team Championships in
Madison, Wis. Trinity beat the
Cards 8-1 and went on to clinch the
team title.
Yesterday the Tigers defeated
SMU in the semifinals, 5-4.
Stanford's No. 3 seeded tennis
team upset No. 1 seed UCLA yes
terday in the semifinals of the
NCAA tennis tournament in
Athens, Ga.
The Cards blasted the Bruins, 6-3,
winning their first five singles
matches and will face second
seeded Trinity University of Texas
in today's finals.
"I think beating UCLA was a tre
mendous achievement," said coach
Dick Gould in a telephone inter
view last night. "We are the only
team in the country who has beaten
them and we've beaten them twice.
But it doesn't mean all that much
unless we can win tomorrow."
