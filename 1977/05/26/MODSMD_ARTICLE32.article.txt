Carter details new welfare system
Washington — The Carter administration is tenta
tively planning a new welfare system that would
classify poor people on the basis of whether or not
they are expected to work, HEW Secretary Joseph
Califano said yesterday.
Those expected not to work, the aged, disabled
and single parents with young children, would be
given a single cash payment by the federal govern
ment which the states or local government could
supplement if they wished.
A typical federal payment for that group would be
$4200 for a family of four, at least as high as what the
government now pays welfare families in cash or
food stamps. The stamps would be abolished under
the new system.
Those expected to work would be eligible for
public-service jobs at the minimum wage and would
receive cash supplements to help raise them over the
poverty line. A family of four'in that group could
receive up to $2300 in addition to wages.
As explained by the HEW secretary, the welfare
reform plan outlined in broad terms by Carter on
May 2 is beginning to take shape, although some
changes are likely before the proposal goes to Con
gress in August.
Some details of the plan, such as the definition of
young children, are still to be worked out, Califano
told reporters. And he emphasized that the figures
are tentative and likely to change as officials of the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the
Labor Department and the White House discuss the
impact of the proposal with state officials and con
gressional leaders.
The payment schedule under the new plan was
not spelled out but most government aid plans are
paid on a monthly basis.
Califano said the plan is designed to reward those
who work by insuring that they get more money than
those who don't. Those who are expected to work but
who don't would not make as much as those not
expected to work.
The plan also provides incentives to encourage
people to take jobs in the private sector rather than
public service jobs. It envisions the creation of 1.4
million public service and private sector jobs in the
hope of providing employment for all those required
to work and anyone else who wants to.
Young says everyone's a racist
London — Ambassador Andrew Young, on his
way home from an eight-nation African tour, said
yesterday that everyone is a racist but that some
people, such as Russians and Swedes, are bigger
racists than others.
The black U.S. envoy to the United Nations stop
ped in London to confer today with British Foreign
Secretary David Owen on the U.S.-British campaign
to bring racial peace to Rhodesia.
Earlier this year Young had to apologize after say
ing Britain was "a little chicken on racism."
On the flight here from Khartoum, Sudan, his last

African stop, Young told reporters he intends no
condemnation or moral judgment when he uses the
term "racist."
"It's impossible not to be a racist if you talk of
racism as ethno-centricity," he said. "Nobody is
immune. I'm only saying that overcoming cultural
difficulties and cultural insecurity is something you
have to work at very consciously."
The only places where racism is on the decline are
those where it is under constant discussion, as in the
American South, he said.
"The thing about northern U.S. cities and England
is they were never forced to face up to latent racism
or to realize it exists," he said.
"It's no moral judgment. The worst racists in the
world are the Russians — they have no experience
with it."
"The Swedes are terrible racists," he said in re
sponse to a question. "They have an ideology which
makes them very humanitarian and liberal, but when
the crunch comes the black in Sweden is treated just
like the black in Queens, New York City."
Saudis assure Carter on Israel
Washington — Saudi Arabia has assured Presi
dent Jimmy Carter that it accepts a secure Israel in
any ultimate settlement in the Middle East and that it
has not raised the threat of an oil embargo.
"I think that we understand each other very well,"
Carter said yesterday at the conclusion of talks with
Crown Prince Fahd, who ranks No. 2 in the Saudi
hierarchy. "So far as I know, between ourselves and
Saudi Arabia, there are no disturbing differences at
all."
Actually, U.S. officials said, there are substantial
differences over the Palestinians as well as interpre
tation of United Nations resolution regarding ter
ritories captured in the 1967 war.
But, the officials said, Carter was deeply impre
ssed with Saudi Arabia's interest in a peaceful solu
tion to the Arab-Israeli conflict and its understand
ing of the strong American commitment to Israel.
Carter's remarks could be viewed as an enticement
to Israel's incoming militant leadership to agree to
concessions.
The specter of another oil embargo surfaced just
before the start of Fahd's visit. According to a report
from the Middle East, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Ismail Fahmi said an embargo would be imposed if
the new Israeli government refused to surrender the
1967 territories.
"There is no threatened embargo at all," Carter
told reporters as he walked with Fahd to a waiting
limousine. "He said that was a completely false re
port."
Saudi Arabia has been militantly anti-Zionist, al
though its ultimate acceptance of Israel as a state
appeared inevitable.
One major unanswered question is whether Fahd
had given the president any reason to believe the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) takes the
same view* By covenant the PLO is committed to the
dismantling of the Jewish state.

Carter said his views on a homeland for Palesti
nian refugees were not firm, although "this clearly is
something that will have to be accommodated."
Terrorists display bound captives
Assen, The Netherlands — South Moluccan ter
rorists shoved three bound and blindfolded hostages
from a hijacked train with ropes around their necks
yesterday, evidently to establish their "complete
power" over the victims, authorities said.
The three appeared unhurt when they were pulled
back into the train after standing on the tracks, which
run through open pasture land, for periods ranging
from 45 to 63 minutes.
Two bands of extremists seeking independence
from Indonesia for their Pacific island homeland,
once a Dutch colony, seized a train and a village
elementary school simultaneously Monday morning
in the second South Moluccan terrorist action in two
years.
They have threatened to start killing the 55 hos
tages on the train and 105 children and six teachers
in the school unless fellow terrorists imprisoned
after the 1975 raid are freed and the entire group is
flown out of the country.
A deadline for the killing to begin passed yester
day morning without signs of action on the threat.
Authorities have refused to deal until the children
are freed.
The development came after the train hijackers,
believed to be six men and a woman, appeared to
settle into an uneasy standoff with authorities.
Troops and combat police with armored personnel
carriers ringed the area and there had been little
action since the hijackers refused to accept food and
drink for their captives yesterday.
Recent rains don't help drought
Sacramento — Despite heavy rains this month,
Central Valley reservoirs continued to decline, fal
ling 108,100 acre-feet between April 25 and last

The state Drought Information Center reported
that the amount of water stored is slightly more than
half the amount of a year ago, and 43 per cent of the
10-year average.
About 100,000 acre-feet of water ran into Northern
California reservoirs during the first two weeks of
May, the center reported.
Rainfall since Oct. 1 totals 16.2 inches in the Sac
ramento Basin, compared to a 10-year average in late
May of 55.3 inches.

number of forest fires. Through May 20 there were
1161 fires burning 2869 acres. The five-year average
through the same date is 563 fires.
