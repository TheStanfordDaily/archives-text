Twenty-one apartheid protesters are
expected to plead today in Palo Alto
criminal court. All of them were previ
ously arraigned on Monday, and had
asked for a continuance until today.
The group held a meeting last night
in Columbae House with their defense
attorney, Martin Eichner, a partner in
the Romines and Eichner law firm, to
discuss today's strategy.
After the meeting, Chris Coleman,
spokesman for the group, declined to
say how they will plead tomorrow.
"It's really not to our advantage to
say how we will plead tomorrow,"
Coleman said. "The strategy used to
morrow, however, will set the prece
dent for future arraignment groups."
One of the major problems the group
faced by pleading not guilty is that the
trial would fall sometime in the sum
mer. Judge Edward Scoyen, who is
presiding over all of these cases,
further complicated matters by order
ing protesters to appear in person for
all hearings and trials.
Usually, a defendant's lawyer may
appear for him in abstentia. Scoyen,
however, refused to allow that. This
would mean that anyone pleading not
guilty would have to stay around this
summer for the trial.
"It is possible that this was a ploy to
get us to plead no contest," Coleman
said.
According to Law School Prof. John
Kaplan, the judge did it "just to make
sure they (the protesters) don't take
this too lightly."

Questioning the constitutionality of
one of the charges will probably be one
of the defenses, according to defense
attorneys.
This is not very uncommon how
ever, according to Dept. Dist. Atty.
Tom Fahrenholz.
"You can contest the constitutional
ity of any statute anytime; it isn't that
uncommon," Fahrenholz said. "They
generally don't succeed, however."
"We'll probably abide by the collec
tive decision," Coleman said.
In arraignment proceedings yester
day, one more protester pleaded not
guilty, with 31 asking for a con
tinuance until next week.
