# Nixon on taking pardon: couldn't have a fair trial
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Former Presi
dent Richard Nixon says he would
have preferred "the agony of a trial" to
accepting a presidential pardon that
he knew made him look guilty. But, he
said, "there was no chance whatever I
could get a fair trial."
His mood alternating from bristling
anger to turn-on-turn-off smiles,
Nixon spoke about his final days in
office, the pardon, "contemptible
journalism," and Spiro Agnew, in a
television interview last night.
He described Agnew as "an honest
man ... a courageous man," a victim
of liberals' double standard in the
political system, a man who made mis
takes.
The fourth interview with David
Frost, winding up the current series,
ended with Nixon saying ruefully,
"We have to live with not only the
past, but for the future . . . whatever it
brings, I'll still be fighting."
Resignation
Recalling his final days in office,
Nixon said, "Resignation meant life

On leaving office: "No one can know how it
feels to resign the presidency of the United
States."

without purpose as far as I was con
cerned. No one in the world, and no
one in our history could know how I
felt. No one can know how it feels to
resign the presidency of the United
States.
"Is that punishment enough?"
Nixon said with strong feeling. "Oh,
probably not."
Without mentioning them by name,
Nixon spoke bitterly about reporters
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, au
thors of the book The Final Days.
With tight-lipped anger, he called
their book "contemptible journalism,"
while admitting he had read only
stories about the work rather than Ine
book itself.
'Trash'
"All I say is Mrs. Nixon read it and
her stroke came three days later,"
Nixon said. "1 didn't want her to read it
because 1 knew the kind of trash it was

and the kind of trash they are."
He added, "This doesn't indicate
that that caused the stroke, because the
doctors don't know what caused the
stroke, but it sure didn't help."
Nixon almost spat out: "1 have no
thing but utter contempt. And 1 will
never forgive them. Never."
In the book, the two authors said Pat
Nixon went to the servants quarters in
search of liquor during the last days in
the White House.
"For them to . . . take me on is one
thing," Nixon said. "For them to take
her on, in my view, that's below the
belt."
Admits praying
But the former president confirmed
one account in the book — that the
night before Nixon announced his res
ignation, he and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger cried and knelt in si
lent prayer.
"Now Henry, I know you and I are
both alike in one way," Nixon recalled
saying. "We don't wear our religion on
our sleeve. Fm a Quaker and you're a

Jew and neither of us is very orthodox,
but I think both of us probably have a
deeper religious sensitivity than some
of those that are so loudly proclaiming
it all the time."
Frost: "Did either of you speak?"
Nixon: "No, not a word. That's not
the Quaker fashion."
Nixon said he telephoned Kissinger
later to ask: "Why don't we just keep
that incident to ourselves?" Nixon
said he had made that suggestion be
cause he felt Kissinger might have
been embarrassed by the incident.
On other matters, Nixon said his ef
forts to block the election of Chilean
President Salvador Allende in 1970
were based on fears that a Chile-Cuba
alliance could provoke Communist re
volution throughout Latin America.
Nixon also discussed why he refused
to pardon his two closest aides.
Accepting pardon
The acceptance of his own pardon
from successor Gerald Ford, in Sep
tember 1974 when Nixon had been out
of office exactly one month, "was a
terribly difficult decision for me, al
most as difficult as resigning," Nixon
said.
Frost asked: "Were there any discus
sions on the subject of pardon . . . be
fore you left office?"

On The Final Days; "I didn't want her (Pat) to
read it because I knew the kind of trash it was
and the kind of trash they are."

"Absolutely not, no, no," said Ni
xon. "President Ford has answered
that question under oath and 1 con
sider that I'm responding here, in ef
fect, under oath. There were no such
discussions."
Nixon said he hesitated when his
lawyer, Herbert Miller, brought Ford's
pardon offer to San Clemente, "be
cause when you receive a pardon, you
have to sign a piece of paper that says.
'1 accept the pardon.' "
'Admitting guilt'
He said he told Miller:
"Look, if I accept the pardon, Fm in
effect admitting guilt that I evaded my
income taxes; that I raised the price of
milk because of contributors from the
milk producers; that 1 sold ambas
sadorships; that I took campaign con
tributions and put a million dollars
into my homes; that I engaged in the

illegal activities including everything
from obstruction of justice to abuse of
agencies, to wiretapping. . . .
"1 said, a signing of this pardon, ac
ceptance of this pardon is going to be
interpreted as a confession of guilt."
The lawyer, Nixon said, protested
that acceptance of a pardon is not an
admission of guilt.
"That's legalistic, pettifogging,"
Nixon told Frost. "Most people, in
cluding even President Ford, consi
dered that the pardon was in effect an
admission of guilt."
No trial
It meant, Nixon said, "that I would
not go to trial on the charges, I would
not have a chance to state my side ... 1
said, I'd just as soon go through the
agony of a trial so that we can scrape
away at least all the false charges and
fight it out on those in which there may
be a doubt and then I'll take whatever
the consequences are."
Nixon said Miller told him that he
"had thought it through; in his legal
opinion, there was no chance what
ever I could get a fair trial."
Special Watergate Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski came to the same conclusion
and Ford cited Jaworski's opinion as a
major reason for granting the pardon.
Nixon recalled: "Fair trial or no fair
trial, here I sat. I sat for an hour in the
chair by myself; I asked Miller to leave
the room; and, here in my office in San
Clemente, I called him back in and said
'Well, 1 will sign it.' "
Nixon said subsequent events were
as he expected. "It exacerbated the is
sue," he said of the pardon. "It was
embarrassing to Ford. It cost him a
great deal."
When he called Ford to apologize,
Nixon said, Ford told him: "I don't
give a damn about the criticism; I did it
because it was right."
Funds for aides
The former president said he had of
fered funds — from campaign con
tributions held by his friend Charles
Rebozo or from his own savings — to
his resigned aides H.R. Haldeman and
John Ehrlichman for their legal de
fense.
Haldeman and Ehrlichman, whose
legal expenses eventually ran to about
$500,000 each, refused the offer.
Nixon also said he had intended to
pardon them "if they got a bad rap."
But, Nixon said, despite his "deep
personal feeling" for the two "if my
last act was to pardon everybody who
was in Watergate, that would inflame
the situation and also would obviously
look like the ultimate cover-up."
Therefore, Nixon said, "I did not
consider it."

Frost asked: "Did you ever consider
pardoning yourself before you res
igned?"
Nixon replied that the suggestion
was made and that he had brushed it
aside.
Unlike Haldeman and Ehrlichman
who asked for pardon in Nixon's last
hours as president, Agnew "never
raised any question about clemency or
pressure," Nixon said.
He called the former vice president,
who resigned rather than face prosecu
tion in a Maryland kickback scandal,
the victim of a double standard.
"Because he was conservative, be
cause he was one who took on the
press, he got a lot rougher treatment
than would have been the case had he
been one of the liberals' favorite
pin-up boys," said Nixon.
"When I say 'the liberals' pin-up
boys,' you know exactly the ones I
mean: those that go down the liberal
line and who can see all of the wicked
ness among conservatives and when
it's on their side, well, 'Ha, ha, ha, isn't
that just fun and games.' "
Nixon said he knows Agnew felt he
was being undercut by people in the
White House and that he "has bitter
feelings, certainly about me.
"It was a no-win proposition," the
former president continued. "I felt that
in his heart he was a decent man. He
was an honest man. He was a courage
ous man.

xon. "President Ford has answered
that question under oath and 1 con
sider that I'm responding here, in ef
fect, under oath. There were no such
discussions."
Nixon said he hesitated when his
lawyer, Herbert Miller, brought Ford's
pardon offer to San Clemente, "be
cause when you receive a pardon, you
have to sign a piece of paper that says.
'1 accept the pardon.' "
'Admitting guilt'
He said he told Miller:
"Look, if I accept the pardon, Fm in
effect admitting guilt that I evaded my
income taxes; that I raised the price of
milk because of contributors from the
milk producers; that 1 sold ambas
sadorships; that I took campaign con
tributions and put a million dollars
into my homes; that I engaged in the

illegal activities including everything
from obstruction of justice to abuse of
agencies, to wiretapping. . . .
"1 said, a signing of this pardon, ac
ceptance of this pardon is going to be
interpreted as a confession of guilt."
The lawyer, Nixon said, protested
that acceptance of a pardon is not an
admission of guilt.
"That's legalistic, pettifogging,"
Nixon told Frost. "Most people, in
cluding even President Ford, consi
dered that the pardon was in effect an
admission of guilt."
No trial
It meant, Nixon said, "that I would
not go to trial on the charges, I would
not have a chance to state my side ... 1
said, I'd just as soon go through the
agony of a trial so that we can scrape
away at least all the false charges and
fight it out on those in which there may
be a doubt and then I'll take whatever
the consequences are."
Nixon said Miller told him that he
"had thought it through; in his legal
opinion, there was no chance what
ever I could get a fair trial."
Special Watergate Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski came to the same conclusion
and Ford cited Jaworski's opinion as a
major reason for granting the pardon.
Nixon recalled: "Fair trial or no fair
trial, here I sat. I sat for an hour in the
chair by myself; I asked Miller to leave
the room; and, here in my office in San
Clemente, I called him back in and said
'Well, 1 will sign it.' "
Nixon said subsequent events were
as he expected. "It exacerbated the is
sue," he said of the pardon. "It was
embarrassing to Ford. It cost him a
great deal."
When he called Ford to apologize,
Nixon said, Ford told him: "I don't
give a damn about the criticism; I did it
because it was right."
Funds for aides
The former president said he had of
fered funds — from campaign con
tributions held by his friend Charles
Rebozo or from his own savings — to
his resigned aides H.R. Haldeman and
John Ehrlichman for their legal de
fense.
Haldeman and Ehrlichman, whose
legal expenses eventually ran to about
$500,000 each, refused the offer.
Nixon also said he had intended to
pardon them "if they got a bad rap."
But, Nixon said, despite his "deep
personal feeling" for the two "if my
last act was to pardon everybody who
was in Watergate, that would inflame
the situation and also would obviously
look like the ultimate cover-up."
Therefore, Nixon said, "I did not
consider it."

Frost asked: "Did you ever consider
pardoning yourself before you res
igned?"
Nixon replied that the suggestion
was made and that he had brushed it
aside.
Unlike Haldeman and Ehrlichman
who asked for pardon in Nixon's last
hours as president, Agnew "never
raised any question about clemency or
pressure," Nixon said.
He called the former vice president,
who resigned rather than face prosecu
tion in a Maryland kickback scandal,
the victim of a double standard.
"Because he was conservative, be
cause he was one who took on the
press, he got a lot rougher treatment
than would have been the case had he
been one of the liberals' favorite
pin-up boys," said Nixon.
"When I say 'the liberals' pin-up
boys,' you know exactly the ones I
mean: those that go down the liberal
line and who can see all of the wicked
ness among conservatives and when
it's on their side, well, 'Ha, ha, ha, isn't
that just fun and games.' "
Nixon said he knows Agnew felt he
was being undercut by people in the
White House and that he "has bitter
feelings, certainly about me.
"It was a no-win proposition," the
former president continued. "I felt that
in his heart he was a decent man. He
was an honest man. He was a courage
ous man.
Washington (AP) — Former Presi
dent Richard Nixon says he would
have preferred "the agony of a trial" to
accepting a presidential pardon that
he knew made him look guilty. But, he
said, "there was no chance whatever I
could get a fair trial."
His mood alternating from bristling
anger to turn-on-turn-off smiles,
Nixon spoke about his final days in
office, the pardon, "contemptible
journalism," and Spiro Agnew, in a
television interview last night.
He described Agnew as "an honest
man ... a courageous man," a victim
of liberals' double standard in the
political system, a man who made mis
takes.
The fourth interview with David
Frost, winding up the current series,
ended with Nixon saying ruefully,
"We have to live with not only the
past, but for the future . . . whatever it
brings, I'll still be fighting."
Resignation
Recalling his final days in office,
Nixon said, "Resignation meant life

On leaving office: "No one can know how it
feels to resign the presidency of the United
States."

without purpose as far as I was con
cerned. No one in the world, and no
one in our history could know how I
felt. No one can know how it feels to
resign the presidency of the United
States.
"Is that punishment enough?"
Nixon said with strong feeling. "Oh,
probably not."
Without mentioning them by name,
Nixon spoke bitterly about reporters
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, au
thors of the book The Final Days.
With tight-lipped anger, he called
their book "contemptible journalism,"
while admitting he had read only
stories about the work rather than Ine
book itself.
'Trash'
"All I say is Mrs. Nixon read it and
her stroke came three days later,"
Nixon said. "1 didn't want her to read it
because 1 knew the kind of trash it was

and the kind of trash they are."
He added, "This doesn't indicate
that that caused the stroke, because the
doctors don't know what caused the
stroke, but it sure didn't help."
Nixon almost spat out: "1 have no
thing but utter contempt. And 1 will
never forgive them. Never."
In the book, the two authors said Pat
Nixon went to the servants quarters in
search of liquor during the last days in
the White House.
"For them to . . . take me on is one
thing," Nixon said. "For them to take
her on, in my view, that's below the
belt."
Admits praying
But the former president confirmed
one account in the book — that the
night before Nixon announced his res
ignation, he and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger cried and knelt in si
lent prayer.
"Now Henry, I know you and I are
both alike in one way," Nixon recalled
saying. "We don't wear our religion on
our sleeve. Fm a Quaker and you're a

Jew and neither of us is very orthodox,
but I think both of us probably have a
deeper religious sensitivity than some
of those that are so loudly proclaiming
it all the time."
Frost: "Did either of you speak?"
Nixon: "No, not a word. That's not
the Quaker fashion."
Nixon said he telephoned Kissinger
later to ask: "Why don't we just keep
that incident to ourselves?" Nixon
said he had made that suggestion be
cause he felt Kissinger might have
been embarrassed by the incident.
On other matters, Nixon said his ef
forts to block the election of Chilean
President Salvador Allende in 1970
were based on fears that a Chile-Cuba
alliance could provoke Communist re
volution throughout Latin America.
Nixon also discussed why he refused
to pardon his two closest aides.
Accepting pardon
The acceptance of his own pardon
from successor Gerald Ford, in Sep
tember 1974 when Nixon had been out
of office exactly one month, "was a
terribly difficult decision for me, al
most as difficult as resigning," Nixon
said.
Frost asked: "Were there any discus
sions on the subject of pardon . . . be
fore you left office?"

On The Final Days; "I didn't want her (Pat) to
read it because I knew the kind of trash it was

it's on their side, well, 'Ha, ha, ha, isn't
that just fun and games.' "
Nixon said he knows Agnew felt he
was being undercut by people in the
White House and that he "has bitter
feelings, certainly about me.
"It was a no-win proposition," the
former president continued. "I felt that
in his heart he was a decent man. He
was an honest man. He was a courage
ous man.
Washington (AP) — Former Presi
dent Richard Nixon says he would
have preferred "the agony of a trial" to
accepting a presidential pardon that
he knew made him look guilty. But, he
said, "there was no chance whatever I
could get a fair trial."
His mood alternating from bristling
anger to turn-on-turn-off smiles,
Nixon spoke about his final days in
office, the pardon, "contemptible
journalism," and Spiro Agnew, in a
television interview last night.
He described Agnew as "an honest
man ... a courageous man," a victim
of liberals' double standard in the
political system, a man who made mis
takes.
The fourth interview with David
Frost, winding up the current series,
ended with Nixon saying ruefully,
"We have to live with not only the
past, but for the future . . . whatever it
brings, I'll still be fighting."
Resignation
Recalling his final days in office,
Nixon said, "Resignation meant life

On leaving office: "No one can know how it
feels to resign the presidency of the United
States."

without purpose as far as I was con
cerned. No one in the world, and no
one in our history could know how I
felt. No one can know how it feels to
resign the presidency of the United
States.
"Is that punishment enough?"
Nixon said with strong feeling. "Oh,
probably not."
Without mentioning them by name,
Nixon spoke bitterly about reporters
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, au
thors of the book The Final Days.
With tight-lipped anger, he called
their book "contemptible journalism,"
while admitting he had read only
stories about the work rather than Ine
book itself.
'Trash'
"All I say is Mrs. Nixon read it and
her stroke came three days later,"
Nixon said. "1 didn't want her to read it
because 1 knew the kind of trash it was

and the kind of trash they are."
He added, "This doesn't indicate
that that caused the stroke, because the
doctors don't know what caused the
stroke, but it sure didn't help."
Nixon almost spat out: "1 have no
thing but utter contempt. And 1 will
never forgive them. Never."
In the book, the two authors said Pat
Nixon went to the servants quarters in
search of liquor during the last days in
the White House.
"For them to . . . take me on is one
thing," Nixon said. "For them to take
her on, in my view, that's below the
belt."
Admits praying
But the former president confirmed
one account in the book — that the
night before Nixon announced his res
ignation, he and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger cried and knelt in si
lent prayer.
"Now Henry, I know you and I are
both alike in one way," Nixon recalled
saying. "We don't wear our religion on
our sleeve. Fm a Quaker and you're a

Jew and neither of us is very orthodox,
but I think both of us probably have a
deeper religious sensitivity than some
of those that are so loudly proclaiming
it all the time."
Frost: "Did either of you speak?"
Nixon: "No, not a word. That's not
the Quaker fashion."
Nixon said he telephoned Kissinger
later to ask: "Why don't we just keep
that incident to ourselves?" Nixon
said he had made that suggestion be
cause he felt Kissinger might have
been embarrassed by the incident.
On other matters, Nixon said his ef
forts to block the election of Chilean
President Salvador Allende in 1970
were based on fears that a Chile-Cuba
alliance could provoke Communist re
volution throughout Latin America.
Nixon also discussed why he refused
to pardon his two closest aides.
Accepting pardon
The acceptance of his own pardon
from successor Gerald Ford, in Sep
tember 1974 when Nixon had been out
of office exactly one month, "was a
terribly difficult decision for me, al
most as difficult as resigning," Nixon
said.
Frost asked: "Were there any discus
sions on the subject of pardon . . . be
fore you left office?"

On The Final Days; "I didn't want her (Pat) to
read it because I knew the kind of trash it was
and the kind of trash they are."

"Absolutely not, no, no," said Ni
xon. "President Ford has answered
that question under oath and 1 con
sider that I'm responding here, in ef
fect, under oath. There were no such
discussions."
Nixon said he hesitated when his
lawyer, Herbert Miller, brought Ford's
pardon offer to San Clemente, "be
cause when you receive a pardon, you
have to sign a piece of paper that says.
'1 accept the pardon.' "
'Admitting guilt'
He said he told Miller:
"Look, if I accept the pardon, Fm in
effect admitting guilt that I evaded my
income taxes; that I raised the price of
milk because of contributors from the
milk producers; that 1 sold ambas
sadorships; that I took campaign con
tributions and put a million dollars
into my homes; that I engaged in the

illegal activities including everything
from obstruction of justice to abuse of
agencies, to wiretapping. . . .
"1 said, a signing of this pardon, ac
ceptance of this pardon is going to be
interpreted as a confession of guilt."
The lawyer, Nixon said, protested
that acceptance of a pardon is not an
admission of guilt.
"That's legalistic, pettifogging,"
Nixon told Frost. "Most people, in
cluding even President Ford, consi
dered that the pardon was in effect an
admission of guilt."
No trial
It meant, Nixon said, "that I would
not go to trial on the charges, I would
not have a chance to state my side ... 1
said, I'd just as soon go through the
agony of a trial so that we can scrape
away at least all the false charges and
fight it out on those in which there may
be a doubt and then I'll take whatever
the consequences are."
Nixon said Miller told him that he
"had thought it through; in his legal
opinion, there was no chance what
ever I could get a fair trial."
Special Watergate Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski came to the same conclusion
and Ford cited Jaworski's opinion as a
major reason for granting the pardon.
Nixon recalled: "Fair trial or no fair
trial, here I sat. I sat for an hour in the
chair by myself; I asked Miller to leave
the room; and, here in my office in San
Clemente, I called him back in and said
'Well, 1 will sign it.' "
Nixon said subsequent events were
as he expected. "It exacerbated the is
sue," he said of the pardon. "It was
embarrassing to Ford. It cost him a
great deal."
When he called Ford to apologize,
Nixon said, Ford told him: "I don't
give a damn about the criticism; I did it
because it was right."
Funds for aides
The former president said he had of
fered funds — from campaign con
tributions held by his friend Charles
Rebozo or from his own savings — to
his resigned aides H.R. Haldeman and
John Ehrlichman for their legal de
fense.
Haldeman and Ehrlichman, whose
legal expenses eventually ran to about
$500,000 each, refused the offer.
Nixon also said he had intended to
pardon them "if they got a bad rap."
But, Nixon said, despite his "deep
personal feeling" for the two "if my
last act was to pardon everybody who
was in Watergate, that would inflame
the situation and also would obviously
look like the ultimate cover-up."
Therefore, Nixon said, "I did not
consider it."

Frost asked: "Did you ever consider
pardoning yourself before you res
igned?"
Nixon replied that the suggestion
was made and that he had brushed it
aside.
Unlike Haldeman and Ehrlichman
who asked for pardon in Nixon's last
hours as president, Agnew "never
raised any question about clemency or
pressure," Nixon said.
He called the former vice president,
who resigned rather than face prosecu
tion in a Maryland kickback scandal,
the victim of a double standard.
"Because he was conservative, be
cause he was one who took on the
press, he got a lot rougher treatment
than would have been the case had he
been one of the liberals' favorite
pin-up boys," said Nixon.
"When I say 'the liberals' pin-up
boys,' you know exactly the ones I
mean: those that go down the liberal
line and who can see all of the wicked
ness among conservatives and when
it's on their side, well, 'Ha, ha, ha, isn't
that just fun and games.' "
Nixon said he knows Agnew felt he
was being undercut by people in the

terribly difficult decision for me, al
most as difficult as resigning," Nixon
said.
Frost asked: "Were there any discus
sions on the subject of pardon . . . be
fore you left office?"

On The Final Days; "I didn't want her (Pat) to
read it because I knew the kind of trash it was
and the kind of trash they are."

"Absolutely not, no, no," said Ni
xon. "President Ford has answered
that question under oath and 1 con
sider that I'm responding here, in ef
fect, under oath. There were no such
discussions."
Nixon said he hesitated when his
lawyer, Herbert Miller, brought Ford's
pardon offer to San Clemente, "be
cause when you receive a pardon, you
have to sign a piece of paper that says.
'1 accept the pardon.' "
'Admitting guilt'
He said he told Miller:
"Look, if I accept the pardon, Fm in
effect admitting guilt that I evaded my
income taxes; that I raised the price of
milk because of contributors from the
milk producers; that 1 sold ambas
sadorships; that I took campaign con
tributions and put a million dollars
into my homes; that I engaged in the

illegal activities including everything
from obstruction of justice to abuse of
agencies, to wiretapping. . . .
"1 said, a signing of this pardon, ac
ceptance of this pardon is going to be
interpreted as a confession of guilt."
The lawyer, Nixon said, protested
that acceptance of a pardon is not an
admission of guilt.
"That's legalistic, pettifogging,"
Nixon told Frost. "Most people, in
cluding even President Ford, consi
dered that the pardon was in effect an
admission of guilt."
No trial
It meant, Nixon said, "that I would
not go to trial on the charges, I would
not have a chance to state my side ... 1
said, I'd just as soon go through the
agony of a trial so that we can scrape
away at least all the false charges and
fight it out on those in which there may
be a doubt and then I'll take whatever
the consequences are."
Nixon said Miller told him that he
"had thought it through; in his legal
opinion, there was no chance what
ever I could get a fair trial."
Special Watergate Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski came to the same conclusion
and Ford cited Jaworski's opinion as a
major reason for granting the pardon.
Nixon recalled: "Fair trial or no fair
trial, here I sat. I sat for an hour in the
chair by myself; I asked Miller to leave
the room; and, here in my office in San
Clemente, I called him back in and said
'Well, 1 will sign it.' "
Nixon said subsequent events were
as he expected. "It exacerbated the is
sue," he said of the pardon. "It was
embarrassing to Ford. It cost him a
great deal."
When he called Ford to apologize,
Nixon said, Ford told him: "I don't
give a damn about the criticism; I did it
because it was right."
Funds for aides
The former president said he had of
fered funds — from campaign con
tributions held by his friend Charles
Rebozo or from his own savings — to
his resigned aides H.R. Haldeman and
John Ehrlichman for their legal de
fense.
Haldeman and Ehrlichman, whose
legal expenses eventually ran to about
$500,000 each, refused the offer.
Nixon also said he had intended to
pardon them "if they got a bad rap."
But, Nixon said, despite his "deep
personal feeling" for the two "if my
last act was to pardon everybody who
was in Watergate, that would inflame
the situation and also would obviously
look like the ultimate cover-up."
Therefore, Nixon said, "I did not
consider it."

Frost asked: "Did you ever consider
pardoning yourself before you res
igned?"
Nixon replied that the suggestion
was made and that he had brushed it
aside.
Unlike Haldeman and Ehrlichman
who asked for pardon in Nixon's last
hours as president, Agnew "never
raised any question about clemency or
pressure," Nixon said.
He called the former vice president,
who resigned rather than face prosecu
tion in a Maryland kickback scandal,
the victim of a double standard.
"Because he was conservative, be
cause he was one who took on the
press, he got a lot rougher treatment
than would have been the case had he
been one of the liberals' favorite
pin-up boys," said Nixon.
"When I say 'the liberals' pin-up
boys,' you know exactly the ones I
mean: those that go down the liberal
line and who can see all of the wicked
ness among conservatives and when
it's on their side, well, 'Ha, ha, ha, isn't
that just fun and games.' "
Nixon said he knows Agnew felt he
was being undercut by people in the
White House and that he "has bitter
feelings, certainly about me.
"It was a no-win proposition," the
former president continued. "I felt that
in his heart he was a decent man. He
was an honest man. He was a courage
ous man.
Washington (AP) — Former Presi
dent Richard Nixon says he would
have preferred "the agony of a trial" to
accepting a presidential pardon that
he knew made him look guilty. But, he
said, "there was no chance whatever I
could get a fair trial."
His mood alternating from bristling
anger to turn-on-turn-off smiles,
Nixon spoke about his final days in
office, the pardon, "contemptible
journalism," and Spiro Agnew, in a
television interview last night.
He described Agnew as "an honest
man ... a courageous man," a victim
of liberals' double standard in the
political system, a man who made mis
takes.
The fourth interview with David
Frost, winding up the current series,
ended with Nixon saying ruefully,
"We have to live with not only the
past, but for the future . . . whatever it
brings, I'll still be fighting."
Resignation
Recalling his final days in office,
Nixon said, "Resignation meant life

On leaving office: "No one can know how it
feels to resign the presidency of the United
States."

without purpose as far as I was con
cerned. No one in the world, and no
one in our history could know how I
felt. No one can know how it feels to
resign the presidency of the United
States.
"Is that punishment enough?"
Nixon said with strong feeling. "Oh,
probably not."
Without mentioning them by name,
Nixon spoke bitterly about reporters
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, au
thors of the book The Final Days.
With tight-lipped anger, he called
their book "contemptible journalism,"
while admitting he had read only
stories about the work rather than Ine
book itself.
'Trash'
"All I say is Mrs. Nixon read it and
her stroke came three days later,"
Nixon said. "1 didn't want her to read it
because 1 knew the kind of trash it was

and the kind of trash they are."
He added, "This doesn't indicate
that that caused the stroke, because the
doctors don't know what caused the
stroke, but it sure didn't help."
Nixon almost spat out: "1 have no
thing but utter contempt. And 1 will
never forgive them. Never."
In the book, the two authors said Pat
Nixon went to the servants quarters in
search of liquor during the last days in
the White House.
"For them to . . . take me on is one
thing," Nixon said. "For them to take
her on, in my view, that's below the
belt."
Admits praying
But the former president confirmed
one account in the book — that the
night before Nixon announced his res
ignation, he and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger cried and knelt in si
lent prayer.
"Now Henry, I know you and I are
both alike in one way," Nixon recalled
saying. "We don't wear our religion on
our sleeve. Fm a Quaker and you're a

Jew and neither of us is very orthodox,
but I think both of us probably have a
deeper religious sensitivity than some
of those that are so loudly proclaiming
it all the time."
Frost: "Did either of you speak?"
Nixon: "No, not a word. That's not
the Quaker fashion."
Nixon said he telephoned Kissinger
later to ask: "Why don't we just keep
that incident to ourselves?" Nixon
said he had made that suggestion be
cause he felt Kissinger might have
been embarrassed by the incident.
On other matters, Nixon said his ef
forts to block the election of Chilean
President Salvador Allende in 1970
were based on fears that a Chile-Cuba
alliance could provoke Communist re
volution throughout Latin America.
Nixon also discussed why he refused
to pardon his two closest aides.
Accepting pardon
The acceptance of his own pardon
from successor Gerald Ford, in Sep
tember 1974 when Nixon had been out
of office exactly one month, "was a
terribly difficult decision for me, al
most as difficult as resigning," Nixon
said.
Frost asked: "Were there any discus
