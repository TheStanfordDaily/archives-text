# Ousted general says move could cause Korean war
## Carter's troop withdrawal plans criticized 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Army gen
eral who lost his job in Korea for saying
President Jimmy Carter's U.S. troop
withdrawal plans would lead to war
reaffirmed that view yesterday and
said it is shared by other senior offic
ers, American and South Korean.
Meanwhile, during a three-hour
meeting yesterday. Carter's special
representatives, Undersecretary of
State Philip Habib and Gen. George
Brown, chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told South Korean Pres
ident Park Chung-hee that the United
States is pulling out the last of its
ground troops.
Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, whom Car
ter removed from his post last
weekend, said his view is based on
intelligence developed within the past
year that shows North Korea building
its armed forces "far out of proportion
to what we thought they had.'

Singlaub, testifying before a House
armed services subcommittee, said the
Carter administration has never asked
the U.S. military command in Korea
for its opinion on the impact of with
drawal. He said requests by U.S. com
manders in Korea to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff for a rationale of the withdrawal
decision have gone unanswered.
Carter, during the campaign last
year, called for a phased withdrawal of
U.S. ground forces in South Korea,
with air units left in place to protect
the Korean army forces. The administ
ration is now developing a withdrawal
plan involving some 35,000 troops
over four or five years.
Park said he didn't welcome the
withdrawal, but would accept what he
said was an "established" U.S. policy.
Former South Korean President Yun
Po-sun, one of the few political opposi
tion leaders not in jail, said he agreed

with Singlaub that the puilout will
lead to an invasion by Communist
North Korea.
Singlaub, who was chief of staff of
the U.S. Bth Army and the fourth
ranking American officer in Korea,
was abruptly recalled by Carter for
reassignment after the Washington
Post quoted him as saying a U.S. troop
puilout would lead to war.
Agreement
The general told the armed services
subcommittee that other senior U.S.
officers feel the same way and that
some of them reversed their views on
the basis of the new intelligence show
ing the North Koreans with hundreds
of new tanks and other vehicles, artil
lery and swift naval craft, all built in
Korea, and sophisticated MIC 19 fight
ers from China.
Seoul newspapers quoted
Washington reports that the with

drawal of the U.S. 2nd Division and its
33,000 men wouldn't begin for at least
a year while Washington and Seoul
study North Korean reaction.
If all goes well, the troops would
leave in units over the following four
years, the reports said.
The Koreans are worried that North
Korea's tough-talking president, Kim
11-sung, will interpret the troop depar
ture as a sign the United States is
abandoning South Korea.
To make certain there is no mistak
ing U.S. intentions, Habib and Brown
reiterated pledges to defend South
Korea. They also reaffirmed a previous
U.S. commitment to modernize the
600,000-man South Korean army. And
they made clear that the 7000-man
U.S. Air Force contingent in South
Korea, which is nuclear armed, will
remain.

U.S. ground forces in South Korea,
with air units left in place to protect
the Korean army forces. The administ
ration is now developing a withdrawal
plan involving some 35,000 troops
over four or five years.
Park said he didn't welcome the
withdrawal, but would accept what he
said was an "established" U.S. policy.
Former South Korean President Yun
Po-sun, one of the few political opposi
tion leaders not in jail, said he agreed

with Singlaub that the puilout will
lead to an invasion by Communist
North Korea.
Singlaub, who was chief of staff of
the U.S. Bth Army and the fourth
ranking American officer in Korea,
was abruptly recalled by Carter for
reassignment after the Washington
Post quoted him as saying a U.S. troop
puilout would lead to war.
Agreement
The general told the armed services
subcommittee that other senior U.S.
officers feel the same way and that
some of them reversed their views on
the basis of the new intelligence show
ing the North Koreans with hundreds
of new tanks and other vehicles, artil
lery and swift naval craft, all built in
Korea, and sophisticated MIC 19 fight
ers from China.
Seoul newspapers quoted
Washington reports that the with

drawal of the U.S. 2nd Division and its
33,000 men wouldn't begin for at least
a year while Washington and Seoul
study North Korean reaction.
If all goes well, the troops would
leave in units over the following four
years, the reports said.
The Koreans are worried that North
Korea's tough-talking president, Kim
11-sung, will interpret the troop depar
ture as a sign the United States is
abandoning South Korea.
To make certain there is no mistak
ing U.S. intentions, Habib and Brown
reiterated pledges to defend South
Korea. They also reaffirmed a previous
U.S. commitment to modernize the
600,000-man South Korean army. And
they made clear that the 7000-man
U.S. Air Force contingent in South
Korea, which is nuclear armed, will
remain.
Washington (AP) — The Army gen
eral who lost his job in Korea for saying
President Jimmy Carter's U.S. troop
withdrawal plans would lead to war
reaffirmed that view yesterday and
said it is shared by other senior offic
ers, American and South Korean.
Meanwhile, during a three-hour
meeting yesterday. Carter's special
representatives, Undersecretary of
State Philip Habib and Gen. George
Brown, chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told South Korean Pres
ident Park Chung-hee that the United
States is pulling out the last of its
ground troops.
Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, whom Car
ter removed from his post last
weekend, said his view is based on
intelligence developed within the past
year that shows North Korea building
its armed forces "far out of proportion
to what we thought they had.'

Singlaub, testifying before a House
armed services subcommittee, said the
Carter administration has never asked
the U.S. military command in Korea
for its opinion on the impact of with
drawal. He said requests by U.S. com
manders in Korea to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff for a rationale of the withdrawal
decision have gone unanswered.
Carter, during the campaign last
year, called for a phased withdrawal of
U.S. ground forces in South Korea,
with air units left in place to protect
the Korean army forces. The administ
ration is now developing a withdrawal
plan involving some 35,000 troops
over four or five years.
