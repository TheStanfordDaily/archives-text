# Defending Albers' art

Albert Elsen

Serious art was never created or put in
public places as the result of popular con
sensus. It has been characteristic of the
best in modern art that when first shown
it has disappointed the expectations of
the public. One reason for this is that
much of modern art derives from the ar
tists' question: What can art do without?
Josef Albers belonged in this tradition. He
devoted his life to investigating color and
line. His is an art of simple forms. Like his
distinguished contemporary colleague in
architecture, Mies van der Rohe, he be
lieved that ,in the hands of a consummate
artist, "less could be more."
Albers believed that the visual arts
should expose people to line and color in
ways different from those of billboards,
automobiles and packaged products —
which use line and color to sell or identify
something. Just as thf poet and the musi
cian love the purity of sound, Albers
loved the purity of sight. Look through
his great book on the interaction of color
and you will see that for him no two col
ors were inimical. What nourished his life
was the excitement in discovering new
chordings of color.
Irrational geometry
Albers loved the ambiguities of irra
tional geometry: what happens to percep
tion when it encounters ambivalent
perspectives, what happens between the
eye and the brain when we experience
certain visual phenomena. For him, a re
ctangle did not mean Euclid; it possessed
many properties to which the geometri
cian is indifferent, such as the figure's
thickness, weight and locus in a field.
It was once stated by a University
committee on study at Stanford that we
should bring distinguished works to this
campus. The Albers Wall project is such
an attempt. At a university, students
should expect to be exposed to what they
do not know or like — they are entitled to
learn about different ways of seeing the
world, different forms of knowledge and
how it is acquired. The Albers sculpture

belongs on the Stanford campus as much
as the linear accelerator. We should like
to bring it to Stanford as the tangible ex
pression of an artist's thought and sen
sitivity developed over three quarters of a
century. We bring the Albers sculpture as
a tribute to how the human spirit may be
manifest in art.
There is no Nobel Prize in art. But be
fore his death, at 88, Albers was accorded
the first retrospective exhibition of a liv
ing artist's work ever held at the Met
ropolitan Museum of Art. His influence as
an artist and teacher remains incalcula
ble. His lesson, like that of all great
teachers, was to dare. His composition for
the Stanford campus is in the tradition of
the best of modern art: it defies simple
categorization. It brings together ideas
from painting, graphic art, sculpture and
architecture.
The best modern artists have often
worked between the media — just as
many of our best scientists have refused to
be limited to one field.
Free-standing
The Albers Wall is a free-standing
sculpture, a free-standing relief, if labels
must be supplied. It is intended to stand
free in space, accessible to light at all
times of the day so that the highlights and
shadows on the steel and the brick and
stone surfaces, will have full opportunity
to play their roles in relationship to one
another. It is a work that, when experi
enced by people walking towards it or
around it, will disclose differing aspects.
A university teaches his students that the
spirit has many voices, most of which
cannot be set down in black and white
type. The sculpture's meaning cannot be
reduced to a pat formula or simple sen
tence. It has no meaning in the customary
sense used to describe riddles or symbols
in literature. It is there to be experienced
— and when experienced with sympathy
over a period of time, the question of
"meaning" seems unimportant. Unlike
the philosopher, the artist cannot always

put into words why he did something.
The heart has its own reasons. If the
sculptor could verbalize all his work's
meaning, he ought to be a writer.
The artist creates in the conviction that
he can produce serious and often pleasur
able experiences, available only through
his art. And the artist must count on an
audience of intelligent people who are
not totally satisfied with what they previ
ously knew.
Careful site choice
A sculpture as large as the Albers Wall
cannot be placed simply anywhere. The
conditions of its gift require a location
that is prominent, dignified and safe. The
scale and full effect of the work requires
long viewing distances. A group of
people who have spent their lives with
art, have studied the site problems long
and hard. They found only two possible
sites on campus that met all the condi
tions; the area before the Physics Tank is
their final choice.
Stanford is one of the most open cam
puses in the country. Its green grass may
in time be doomed by the water shortage;
it is not ever to be endangered by art.
There has been some concern about
student input in deciding on the site.
The sita was initially chosen by five
faculty members who are instructors in
art or in architecture at Stanford, and who
spend their lives making esthetic judg
ments. This committee then recom
mended the site to the University Land
and Building Committee. On that com
mittee there are students as well as faculty
and staff. One student vote on this com
mittee can neutralize the sole vote that
represents the subcommittee of experts.
In other words, the views of six faculty
experts can be offset by the vote of some
one who may have little experience, in
terest or sympathy with art.
The University Committee on Land and
Building approved the present site with
out dissent.

— and when experienced with sympathy
over a period of time, the question of
"meaning" seems unimportant. Unlike
the philosopher, the artist cannot always

put into words why he did something.
The heart has its own reasons. If the
sculptor could verbalize all his work's
meaning, he ought to be a writer.
The artist creates in the conviction that
he can produce serious and often pleasur
able experiences, available only through
his art. And the artist must count on an
audience of intelligent people who are
not totally satisfied with what they previ

Careful site choice
A sculpture as large as the Albers Wall
cannot be placed simply anywhere. The
conditions of its gift require a location
that is prominent, dignified and safe. The
scale and full effect of the work requires
long viewing distances. A group of
people who have spent their lives with
art, have studied the site problems long
and hard. They found only two possible
sites on campus that met all the condi
tions; the area before the Physics Tank is
their final choice.
Stanford is one of the most open cam
puses in the country. Its green grass may
in time be doomed by the water shortage;
it is not ever to be endangered by art.
There has been some concern about
student input in deciding on the site.
The sita was initially chosen by five
faculty members who are instructors in
art or in architecture at Stanford, and who
spend their lives making esthetic judg
ments. This committee then recom
mended the site to the University Land
and Building Committee. On that com
mittee there are students as well as faculty
and staff. One student vote on this com
mittee can neutralize the sole vote that
represents the subcommittee of experts.
In other words, the views of six faculty
experts can be offset by the vote of some
one who may have little experience, in
terest or sympathy with art.

Building approved the present site with

Serious art was never created or put in
public places as the result of popular con
sensus. It has been characteristic of the
best in modern art that when first shown
it has disappointed the expectations of
the public. One reason for this is that
much of modern art derives from the ar
tists' question: What can art do without?
Josef Albers belonged in this tradition. He
devoted his life to investigating color and
line. His is an art of simple forms. Like his
distinguished contemporary colleague in
architecture, Mies van der Rohe, he be
lieved that ,in the hands of a consummate
artist, "less could be more."
Albers believed that the visual arts
should expose people to line and color in
ways different from those of billboards,
automobiles and packaged products —
which use line and color to sell or identify
something. Just as thf poet and the musi
cian love the purity of sound, Albers
loved the purity of sight. Look through
his great book on the interaction of color
and you will see that for him no two col
ors were inimical. What nourished his life
was the excitement in discovering new
chordings of color.
Irrational geometry
Albers loved the ambiguities of irra
tional geometry: what happens to percep
tion when it encounters ambivalent
perspectives, what happens between the
eye and the brain when we experience
certain visual phenomena. For him, a re
ctangle did not mean Euclid; it possessed
many properties to which the geometri
cian is indifferent, such as the figure's
thickness, weight and locus in a field.
It was once stated by a University
committee on study at Stanford that we
should bring distinguished works to this
campus. The Albers Wall project is such
an attempt. At a university, students
should expect to be exposed to what they
do not know or like — they are entitled to
learn about different ways of seeing the
world, different forms of knowledge and
how it is acquired. The Albers sculpture

belongs on the Stanford campus as much
as the linear accelerator. We should like
to bring it to Stanford as the tangible ex
pression of an artist's thought and sen
sitivity developed over three quarters of a
century. We bring the Albers sculpture as
a tribute to how the human spirit may be
manifest in art.
There is no Nobel Prize in art. But be
fore his death, at 88, Albers was accorded
the first retrospective exhibition of a liv
ing artist's work ever held at the Met
ropolitan Museum of Art. His influence as
an artist and teacher remains incalcula
ble. His lesson, like that of all great
teachers, was to dare. His composition for
the Stanford campus is in the tradition of
the best of modern art: it defies simple
categorization. It brings together ideas
from painting, graphic art, sculpture and
architecture.
The best modern artists have often
worked between the media — just as
many of our best scientists have refused to
be limited to one field.
Free-standing
The Albers Wall is a free-standing
sculpture, a free-standing relief, if labels
must be supplied. It is intended to stand
free in space, accessible to light at all
times of the day so that the highlights and
shadows on the steel and the brick and
stone surfaces, will have full opportunity
to play their roles in relationship to one
another. It is a work that, when experi
enced by people walking towards it or
around it, will disclose differing aspects.
A university teaches his students that the
spirit has many voices, most of which
cannot be set down in black and white
type. The sculpture's meaning cannot be
reduced to a pat formula or simple sen
tence. It has no meaning in the customary
sense used to describe riddles or symbols
in literature. It is there to be experienced
— and when experienced with sympathy
over a period of time, the question of
"meaning" seems unimportant. Unlike
the philosopher, the artist cannot always

put into words why he did something.

an attempt. At a university, students
should expect to be exposed to what they
do not know or like — they are entitled to
learn about different ways of seeing the
world, different forms of knowledge and
how it is acquired. The Albers sculpture

belongs on the Stanford campus as much
as the linear accelerator. We should like
to bring it to Stanford as the tangible ex
pression of an artist's thought and sen
sitivity developed over three quarters of a
century. We bring the Albers sculpture as
a tribute to how the human spirit may be
manifest in art.
There is no Nobel Prize in art. But be
fore his death, at 88, Albers was accorded
the first retrospective exhibition of a liv
ing artist's work ever held at the Met
ropolitan Museum of Art. His influence as
an artist and teacher remains incalcula
ble. His lesson, like that of all great
teachers, was to dare. His composition for
the Stanford campus is in the tradition of
the best of modern art: it defies simple
categorization. It brings together ideas
from painting, graphic art, sculpture and
architecture.
The best modern artists have often
worked between the media — just as
many of our best scientists have refused to
be limited to one field.
Free-standing
The Albers Wall is a free-standing
sculpture, a free-standing relief, if labels
must be supplied. It is intended to stand
free in space, accessible to light at all
times of the day so that the highlights and
shadows on the steel and the brick and
stone surfaces, will have full opportunity
to play their roles in relationship to one
another. It is a work that, when experi
enced by people walking towards it or
around it, will disclose differing aspects.
A university teaches his students that the
spirit has many voices, most of which
cannot be set down in black and white
type. The sculpture's meaning cannot be
reduced to a pat formula or simple sen
tence. It has no meaning in the customary
sense used to describe riddles or symbols
in literature. It is there to be experienced
— and when experienced with sympathy
over a period of time, the question of
"meaning" seems unimportant. Unlike
the philosopher, the artist cannot always

put into words why he did something.
The heart has its own reasons. If the
sculptor could verbalize all his work's
meaning, he ought to be a writer.
The artist creates in the conviction that
he can produce serious and often pleasur
able experiences, available only through
his art. And the artist must count on an
audience of intelligent people who are
not totally satisfied with what they previ
ously knew.
Careful site choice
A sculpture as large as the Albers Wall
cannot be placed simply anywhere. The
conditions of its gift require a location
that is prominent, dignified and safe. The
scale and full effect of the work requires
long viewing distances. A group of
people who have spent their lives with
art, have studied the site problems long
and hard. They found only two possible
sites on campus that met all the condi
tions; the area before the Physics Tank is
their final choice.
Stanford is one of the most open cam
puses in the country. Its green grass may
in time be doomed by the water shortage;
it is not ever to be endangered by art.
There has been some concern about
student input in deciding on the site.
The sita was initially chosen by five
faculty members who are instructors in
art or in architecture at Stanford, and who
spend their lives making esthetic judg
ments. This committee then recom
mended the site to the University Land
and Building Committee. On that com
mittee there are students as well as faculty
and staff. One student vote on this com
mittee can neutralize the sole vote that
represents the subcommittee of experts.
In other words, the views of six faculty
experts can be offset by the vote of some
one who may have little experience, in
terest or sympathy with art.
The University Committee on Land and
Building approved the present site with
out dissent.

Serious art was never created or put in
public places as the result of popular con
sensus. It has been characteristic of the
best in modern art that when first shown
it has disappointed the expectations of
the public. One reason for this is that
much of modern art derives from the ar
tists' question: What can art do without?
Josef Albers belonged in this tradition. He
devoted his life to investigating color and
line. His is an art of simple forms. Like his
distinguished contemporary colleague in
architecture, Mies van der Rohe, he be
lieved that ,in the hands of a consummate
artist, "less could be more."
Albers believed that the visual arts
should expose people to line and color in
ways different from those of billboards,
automobiles and packaged products —
which use line and color to sell or identify
something. Just as thf poet and the musi
cian love the purity of sound, Albers
loved the purity of sight. Look through
his great book on the interaction of color
and you will see that for him no two col
ors were inimical. What nourished his life
was the excitement in discovering new
chordings of color.
Irrational geometry
Albers loved the ambiguities of irra
tional geometry: what happens to percep
tion when it encounters ambivalent
perspectives, what happens between the
eye and the brain when we experience
certain visual phenomena. For him, a re
ctangle did not mean Euclid; it possessed
many properties to which the geometri
cian is indifferent, such as the figure's
thickness, weight and locus in a field.
It was once stated by a University
committee on study at Stanford that we
should bring distinguished works to this
campus. The Albers Wall project is such
an attempt. At a university, students
should expect to be exposed to what they
do not know or like — they are entitled to
learn about different ways of seeing the
world, different forms of knowledge and
how it is acquired. The Albers sculpture

belongs on the Stanford campus as much
as the linear accelerator. We should like
to bring it to Stanford as the tangible ex
