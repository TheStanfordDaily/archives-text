# Arab-Israeli debate goes on and on

Rachelle Marshall

The articles by Ahmad Abu-El-Hai ja and Alex Alben's response to
them show once again that the question of Israel and the Arabs can be
passionately and endlessly debated, with the same facts interpreted
in opposite ways. However, Alben's article contained two important
errors that should be corrected.
He claimed that the Palestinians left their homes, their farms and
businesses in 1948 because of "an unfounded Arab fear, fueled by
the divisive intentions of their manipulative rulers." The fact is that
during the fighting that took place after partition in 1947, Israeli
forces also launched what the Encyclopedia Britannica calls "a
campaign of psychological warfare."
This included terrorist attacks on Arab villages and the murder of
1550 civilians in the town of Deir Yassin—the latter operation led by
Menahem Begin, Israel's newly-elected prime minister. The purpose
of these attacks was to drive the Palestinians out of Israel; the Arabs'
fear was not "unfounded."
Alben said that Israel is willing to "discuss the establishment of a
Palestinian state with anyone who does not deny their right to exist."
Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Under Prime Minister Rabin the
Israeli cabinet flatly rejected a proposal by five of its members that
the government express its willingness to discuss creation of aPales
tinian state with any group that agreed to recognize Israel and to
renounce the use of force against her.
Rabin said unequivocally that there would be "no establishment"
of a Palestinian state. Last January Foreign Minister Yigal Allon
reaffirmed that Israel "will continue to oppose vigorously the sterile
idea of the establishment of a third state between Israel and Jordan."

And on Feb. 15, the Wall Street Journal reported that Israeli
government officials "remain unbending" on the Palestinian ques
tion.
Arguing over past history has only limited usefulness. The crucial
question concerning the Middle East at this moment is whether
Israel can continue to retain control over a conquered territory, and a
hostile population, without disastrous consequences to herself and
to the world.
Protest demonstrations against Israeli occupation continue, and
more and more force becomes necessary to put them down. Reports
of torture and beating in Israeli prisons have been documented in the
Washington Post, the Christian Science Monitor and other reputable
journals. There are at least 2500 "security prisoners" in Israeli jails.
We know from U.S. involvement in Vietnam, from the British in
Ireland and the French in Algeria, that no government — however
democratic at home — can exert its will over an unwilling popula
tion without resorting to brutal methods.
The inescapable fact is that the people of the occupied territories
and the Palestinian diaspora see themselves as having a common
claim to nationhood.
The drive for national independence in Africa and Asia, in recent
years, has proven to be virtually irresistible and there is no indica
tion that the Palestinians will beany less determined toachieve what
they perceive to be their rights. To claim they are only pawns of the
Arab nations is to turn away from reality.
Such wishful thinking, as the U.S. learned in Vietnam, can have
far-reaching and tragic consequences.

democratic at home — can exert its will over an unwilling popula
tion without resorting to brutal methods.
The inescapable fact is that the people of the occupied territories
and the Palestinian diaspora see themselves as having a common
claim to nationhood.
The drive for national independence in Africa and Asia, in recent
years, has proven to be virtually irresistible and there is no indica
tion that the Palestinians will beany less determined toachieve what
they perceive to be their rights. To claim they are only pawns of the
Arab nations is to turn away from reality.
Such wishful thinking, as the U.S. learned in Vietnam, can have
far-reaching and tragic consequences.

The articles by Ahmad Abu-El-Hai ja and Alex Alben's response to
them show once again that the question of Israel and the Arabs can be
passionately and endlessly debated, with the same facts interpreted
in opposite ways. However, Alben's article contained two important
errors that should be corrected.
He claimed that the Palestinians left their homes, their farms and
businesses in 1948 because of "an unfounded Arab fear, fueled by
the divisive intentions of their manipulative rulers." The fact is that
during the fighting that took place after partition in 1947, Israeli
forces also launched what the Encyclopedia Britannica calls "a
campaign of psychological warfare."
This included terrorist attacks on Arab villages and the murder of
1550 civilians in the town of Deir Yassin—the latter operation led by
Menahem Begin, Israel's newly-elected prime minister. The purpose
of these attacks was to drive the Palestinians out of Israel; the Arabs'
fear was not "unfounded."
Alben said that Israel is willing to "discuss the establishment of a
Palestinian state with anyone who does not deny their right to exist."
Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Under Prime Minister Rabin the
Israeli cabinet flatly rejected a proposal by five of its members that
the government express its willingness to discuss creation of aPales
tinian state with any group that agreed to recognize Israel and to
renounce the use of force against her.
Rabin said unequivocally that there would be "no establishment"
of a Palestinian state. Last January Foreign Minister Yigal Allon
reaffirmed that Israel "will continue to oppose vigorously the sterile
idea of the establishment of a third state between Israel and Jordan."

And on Feb. 15, the Wall Street Journal reported that Israeli
government officials "remain unbending" on the Palestinian ques
tion.
Arguing over past history has only limited usefulness. The crucial
question concerning the Middle East at this moment is whether
Israel can continue to retain control over a conquered territory, and a
hostile population, without disastrous consequences to herself and
to the world.
Protest demonstrations against Israeli occupation continue, and
more and more force becomes necessary to put them down. Reports
of torture and beating in Israeli prisons have been documented in the
Washington Post, the Christian Science Monitor and other reputable
journals. There are at least 2500 "security prisoners" in Israeli jails.
We know from U.S. involvement in Vietnam, from the British in
Ireland and the French in Algeria, that no government — however
democratic at home — can exert its will over an unwilling popula
tion without resorting to brutal methods.
