## Western culture 
### 
Ron Rebholz

The task force on the western
culture requirement has so far
met 10 times. We do not by any
means think that we have
explored in our discussions all
the possible ways of satisfying
the requirement or that we have
recognized all the implications
of the plans we have discussed.
We have been guided in our
discussion by two principles:
that the goals of the proposed re
quirement are to provide Stan
ford undergraduates a serious
encounter with some important
aspects of western culture and to
insure that they possess, as early
in their University career as pos
sible, a body of knowledge about
western culture valuable in its
own right, useful as a context for
further study and potentially
stimulating for the common in
tellectual life of the University;
and that any instruction related
to the requirement must be ex
cellent.
The first plan we discussed
had as its core a reading list, the
contents of which we debated in
general terms without reaching
any conclusions. Some members
thought the list should em
phasize the history of political,
social and economic institu
tions; others thought it should
emphasize intellectual and liter
ary history. We envisioned what
we have come to call, fondly and
ivot disparagingly, "satellite
courses" that "orbit" around the
material in the reading list, inti
mately related to it but with dis
tinctive emphases. We thought
of satellite courses that would
treat the history of institutions,
ideas, literature, drama, paint
ing, sculpture, music, political
and economic theory, scientific
thought, European and U.S. im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America, and the relation
ship of technology and society,
or any appropriate combination
of these subjects.
We favored instruction in
small groups as the best way of
helping students work with the

common reading. We posited
three satellite courses, in which
examinations would be inde
pendent of examinations on the
common reading but might in
clude some questions relating
the common reading to the par
ticular subject and emphasis of
the satellite. It seemed feasible to
us that students might change
emphasis in the satellite courses
— perhaps, for example, taking
courses that stressed philosophy
in the first quarter, drama in the
second, and the relationship of
technology and society in the
third — provided the courses
were chosen to give historical
coverage somewhat commensu
rate with the historical sweep of
the core.
In the second plan we con
templated two cores, one on the
history of institutions, the other
on intellectual and literary his
tory to be taught in fairly large
lectures. As in the first plan,
satellite courses would orbit
about the cores but might be
taught in small groups. At this
stage we were accepting the
seeming impossibility of agre
eing on the emphasis in the core
and also considering alternative
modes of instruction.
Our third plan resulted from a
kind of dialectical struggle bet
ween the first two. We agreed
that an approach emphasizing
institutional history might rely
on secondary sources to the neg
lect of primary "documents,"
like philosophical and theologi
cal works, plays, poems, novels,
paintings and works by histo
rians and economic or social
theorists. We also agreed that an
emphasis on "great books" or
"great works" could be ahistori
cal.
Synthesizing these agree
ments, we developed a plan in
which the primary works would
be studied in their relationships
to their political, social,
economic, and intellectual con
texts, the contexts to be discus
sed in lectures and the primary

works to be studied in small
groups. Again, as in the first two
plans, satellite courses would
deepen and extend the under
standing of the materials in the
core and relate them to other as
pects of the culture.
The fourth plan we have con
sidered is similar to that prop
osed by the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Under
graduate Education. Students
would choose from a limited
number of "tracks" — possibly
four to eight — similar in subject
matter to the satellite courses in
the first three plans, with the
possibility that more than one
course would be offered within
each track.
In all of our discussions we
have assumed that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the require
ment.
We see problems common to
the first three plans. Most obvi
ous is the conflict between a de
sire for historical coverage and a
distaste for superficiality. We
think the core course would
have to vary degrees of intensity
and superficiality: it might, for
example, in the first quarter,
emphasize Greek culture in the
fifth and fourth centuries 8.C.,
and treat the Roman and
Judaeo-Christian influences on
western culture with relative
superficiality, or vice versa. An
advantage of the second and
third plans over the first is that
historical coverage can probably
be more easily achieved in lec
tures than in discussions by
small groups.
Another problem is keeping a
substantial requirement compat
ible with already demanding
programs, like engineering and
with all students' desire for a
good deal of free choice. We
have considered the possibility
of having the satellite courses
satisfy three of the distribution
requirements in areas answering
to the courses' disciplinary
emphases. And, of course, there
is the problem of money to pay
for excellent instructors and in
struction in small groups.
The fourth plan would drasti
cally reduce or even eliminate
the common reading at the core
of the first three plans and hence
diminish the likelihood of the
requirements's energizing the
intellectual life of the commun
ity. It would be the easiest plan
to implement within existing
structures. It would be the
easiest plan to implement
within existing structures, but
its very ease might discourage
the innovative thinking about
undergraduate education neces
sary to implement any of the first
three plans.
At the moment the task force
tentatively prefers the third
plan, but we intend to keep our
thinking fluid and to see advice
on these plans and any alterna
tives well into autumn quarter.
We will be meeting with the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies in the first week of June
to get their responses and we are
anxious to receive any other re
sponses now, during the sum
mer, and in the autumn.

The task force on the western
culture requirement has so far
met 10 times. We do not by any
means think that we have
explored in our discussions all
the possible ways of satisfying
the requirement or that we have
recognized all the implications
of the plans we have discussed.
We have been guided in our
discussion by two principles:
that the goals of the proposed re
quirement are to provide Stan
ford undergraduates a serious
encounter with some important
aspects of western culture and to
insure that they possess, as early
in their University career as pos
sible, a body of knowledge about
western culture valuable in its
own right, useful as a context for
further study and potentially
stimulating for the common in
tellectual life of the University;
and that any instruction related
to the requirement must be ex
cellent.
The first plan we discussed
had as its core a reading list, the
contents of which we debated in
general terms without reaching
any conclusions. Some members
thought the list should em
phasize the history of political,
social and economic institu
tions; others thought it should
emphasize intellectual and liter
ary history. We envisioned what
we have come to call, fondly and
ivot disparagingly, "satellite
courses" that "orbit" around the
material in the reading list, inti
mately related to it but with dis
tinctive emphases. We thought
of satellite courses that would
treat the history of institutions,
ideas, literature, drama, paint
ing, sculpture, music, political
and economic theory, scientific
thought, European and U.S. im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America, and the relation
ship of technology and society,
or any appropriate combination
of these subjects.
We favored instruction in
small groups as the best way of
helping students work with the

common reading. We posited
three satellite courses, in which
examinations would be inde
pendent of examinations on the
common reading but might in
clude some questions relating
the common reading to the par
ticular subject and emphasis of
the satellite. It seemed feasible to
us that students might change
emphasis in the satellite courses
— perhaps, for example, taking
courses that stressed philosophy
in the first quarter, drama in the
second, and the relationship of
technology and society in the
third — provided the courses
were chosen to give historical
coverage somewhat commensu
rate with the historical sweep of
the core.
In the second plan we con
templated two cores, one on the
history of institutions, the other
on intellectual and literary his
tory to be taught in fairly large
lectures. As in the first plan,
satellite courses would orbit
about the cores but might be
taught in small groups. At this
stage we were accepting the
seeming impossibility of agre
eing on the emphasis in the core
and also considering alternative
modes of instruction.
Our third plan resulted from a
kind of dialectical struggle bet
ween the first two. We agreed
that an approach emphasizing
institutional history might rely
on secondary sources to the neg
lect of primary "documents,"
like philosophical and theologi
cal works, plays, poems, novels,
paintings and works by histo
rians and economic or social
theorists. We also agreed that an
emphasis on "great books" or
"great works" could be ahistori
cal.
Synthesizing these agree
ments, we developed a plan in
which the primary works would
be studied in their relationships
to their political, social,
economic, and intellectual con
texts, the contexts to be discus
sed in lectures and the primary

works to be studied in small
groups. Again, as in the first two
plans, satellite courses would
deepen and extend the under
standing of the materials in the
core and relate them to other as
pects of the culture.
The fourth plan we have con
sidered is similar to that prop
osed by the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Under
graduate Education. Students
would choose from a limited
number of "tracks" — possibly
four to eight — similar in subject
matter to the satellite courses in
the first three plans, with the
possibility that more than one
course would be offered within
each track.
In all of our discussions we
have assumed that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the require
ment.
We see problems common to
the first three plans. Most obvi
ous is the conflict between a de
sire for historical coverage and a
distaste for superficiality. We
think the core course would
have to vary degrees of intensity
and superficiality: it might, for
example, in the first quarter,
emphasize Greek culture in the
fifth and fourth centuries 8.C.,
and treat the Roman and
Judaeo-Christian influences on
western culture with relative
superficiality, or vice versa. An
advantage of the second and
third plans over the first is that
historical coverage can probably
be more easily achieved in lec
tures than in discussions by
small groups.
Another problem is keeping a
substantial requirement compat
ible with already demanding
programs, like engineering and
with all students' desire for a
good deal of free choice. We
have considered the possibility
of having the satellite courses
satisfy three of the distribution
requirements in areas answering
to the courses' disciplinary
emphases. And, of course, there
is the problem of money to pay
for excellent instructors and in
struction in small groups.
The fourth plan would drasti
cally reduce or even eliminate
the common reading at the core
of the first three plans and hence
diminish the likelihood of the
requirements's energizing the
intellectual life of the commun
ity. It would be the easiest plan
to implement within existing
structures. It would be the
easiest plan to implement
within existing structures, but
its very ease might discourage
the innovative thinking about
undergraduate education neces
sary to implement any of the first
three plans.
At the moment the task force
tentatively prefers the third
plan, but we intend to keep our
thinking fluid and to see advice
on these plans and any alterna
tives well into autumn quarter.
We will be meeting with the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies in the first week of June
to get their responses and we are
anxious to receive any other re
sponses now, during the sum
mer, and in the autumn.

The task force on the western
culture requirement has so far
met 10 times. We do not by any
means think that we have
explored in our discussions all
the possible ways of satisfying
the requirement or that we have
recognized all the implications
of the plans we have discussed.
We have been guided in our
discussion by two principles:
that the goals of the proposed re
quirement are to provide Stan
ford undergraduates a serious
encounter with some important
aspects of western culture and to
insure that they possess, as early
in their University career as pos
sible, a body of knowledge about
western culture valuable in its
own right, useful as a context for
further study and potentially
stimulating for the common in
tellectual life of the University;
and that any instruction related
to the requirement must be ex
cellent.
The first plan we discussed
had as its core a reading list, the
contents of which we debated in
general terms without reaching
any conclusions. Some members
thought the list should em
phasize the history of political,
social and economic institu
tions; others thought it should
emphasize intellectual and liter
ary history. We envisioned what
we have come to call, fondly and
ivot disparagingly, "satellite
courses" that "orbit" around the
material in the reading list, inti
mately related to it but with dis
tinctive emphases. We thought
of satellite courses that would
treat the history of institutions,
ideas, literature, drama, paint
ing, sculpture, music, political
and economic theory, scientific
thought, European and U.S. im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America, and the relation
ship of technology and society,
or any appropriate combination
of these subjects.
We favored instruction in
small groups as the best way of
helping students work with the

common reading. We posited
three satellite courses, in which
examinations would be inde
pendent of examinations on the
common reading but might in
clude some questions relating
the common reading to the par
ticular subject and emphasis of
the satellite. It seemed feasible to
us that students might change
emphasis in the satellite courses
— perhaps, for example, taking
courses that stressed philosophy
in the first quarter, drama in the
second, and the relationship of
technology and society in the
third — provided the courses
were chosen to give historical
coverage somewhat commensu
rate with the historical sweep of
the core.
In the second plan we con
templated two cores, one on the
history of institutions, the other
on intellectual and literary his
tory to be taught in fairly large
lectures. As in the first plan,
satellite courses would orbit
about the cores but might be
taught in small groups. At this
stage we were accepting the
seeming impossibility of agre
eing on the emphasis in the core
and also considering alternative
modes of instruction.
Our third plan resulted from a
kind of dialectical struggle bet
ween the first two. We agreed
that an approach emphasizing
institutional history might rely
on secondary sources to the neg
lect of primary "documents,"
like philosophical and theologi
cal works, plays, poems, novels,
paintings and works by histo
rians and economic or social
theorists. We also agreed that an
emphasis on "great books" or
"great works" could be ahistori
cal.
Synthesizing these agree
ments, we developed a plan in
which the primary works would
be studied in their relationships
to their political, social,
economic, and intellectual con
texts, the contexts to be discus
sed in lectures and the primary

works to be studied in small
groups. Again, as in the first two
plans, satellite courses would
deepen and extend the under
standing of the materials in the
core and relate them to other as
pects of the culture.
The fourth plan we have con
sidered is similar to that prop
osed by the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Under
graduate Education. Students
would choose from a limited
number of "tracks" — possibly
four to eight — similar in subject
matter to the satellite courses in
the first three plans, with the
possibility that more than one
course would be offered within
each track.
In all of our discussions we
have assumed that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the require
ment.
We see problems common to
the first three plans. Most obvi
ous is the conflict between a de
sire for historical coverage and a
distaste for superficiality. We
think the core course would
have to vary degrees of intensity
and superficiality: it might, for
example, in the first quarter,
emphasize Greek culture in the
fifth and fourth centuries 8.C.,
and treat the Roman and
Judaeo-Christian influences on
western culture with relative
superficiality, or vice versa. An
advantage of the second and
third plans over the first is that
historical coverage can probably
be more easily achieved in lec
tures than in discussions by
small groups.
Another problem is keeping a
substantial requirement compat
ible with already demanding
programs, like engineering and
with all students' desire for a
good deal of free choice. We
have considered the possibility
of having the satellite courses
satisfy three of the distribution
requirements in areas answering
to the courses' disciplinary
emphases. And, of course, there
is the problem of money to pay
for excellent instructors and in
struction in small groups.
The fourth plan would drasti
cally reduce or even eliminate
the common reading at the core
of the first three plans and hence
diminish the likelihood of the
requirements's energizing the
intellectual life of the commun
ity. It would be the easiest plan
to implement within existing
structures. It would be the
easiest plan to implement
within existing structures, but
its very ease might discourage
the innovative thinking about
undergraduate education neces
sary to implement any of the first
three plans.
At the moment the task force
tentatively prefers the third
plan, but we intend to keep our
thinking fluid and to see advice
on these plans and any alterna
tives well into autumn quarter.
We will be meeting with the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies in the first week of June
to get their responses and we are
anxious to receive any other re
sponses now, during the sum
