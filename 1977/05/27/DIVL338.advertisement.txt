UNIVERSITY-WIDE T.A. ORIENTATION

Dear Graduate Student:
Last October, the Center for Teaching and Learning organized a university-wide

participants indicated that this program was a valuable introduction to their teaching
responsibilities.

invite you to participate. A T.A. Handbook is being prepared for distribution at the
meeting on Sept. 23. The proposed schedule is as follows:
