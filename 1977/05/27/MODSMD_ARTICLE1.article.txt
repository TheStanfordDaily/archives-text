Can you believe we won?"
screamed Perry Wright into the
phone yesterday. "It's unbelieva

some champagne. It's such a rush."
Stanford's tennis team copped its
'hird NCAA team championship in
five years — the second NCAA team
championship for Stanford this
academic school year, an historic
first on the Farm.
Stanford, ranked behind Trinity
all season, downed the Tigers, 5-4
yesterday, to capture the team title
in Athens, Ca. Trinity had beaten
the Cards, 6-3, last February at the
National Intercollegiate Indoor
championships in Madison, Wis.
"I'm really happy," said coach
Dick Could. When Gould took over
the coaching duties here 10 years
ago, the Cards were ranked 33rd in
the country.
We can do it
'Here's a team that came through
all year long," Gould said. "After
the nationals in Madison (where
Trinity took first and Stanford sec

has a chance.' They did everything I
told them to — some things were a
little unreasonable.

Jim Hodges, a freshman from Chevy Chase, Md., combined forces with
teammate Peter Rennert to defeat Trinity's team of Dave Benson and Eddie
Reese, 6-2, 6-0 and clinch the NCAA title for the Cards.
"But the key to the win lies in
the fact that they competed well
every time they had to. If we got
beat, we got beat and we never
sat on a loss."
To beat Trinity yesterday,
Stanford had some long, hard
matches which demanded both
mental and physical stamina.
Sophomore Ail-American
Matt Mitchell (S) defeated Tony
Giammalva (T), 6-3, 7-6 (5-3 tie
breaker); Brian Gottfried (T) beat
Bill Maze (S), 7-5, 4-6, 6-3; Erick
Iskersky (T) defeated Perry
Wright (S), 7-5, 7-6 (5-3); Ben
McKown (T) blasted Jim Hodges
(S), 6-2, 6-2; John Rast (S)
downed Eddie Reese (T), 7-6
(5-1), 6-2; and Lloyd Bourne (S)
smashed Mike Davisdon (T), 6-2,
6-0.
The Cards went into doubles
competition tied three-all.
And Matt Mitchell had a little
talk with the team.
"Matt was great," Wright said.

"He said, 'Fuck, it's just another
match. But we don't want to be
No. 2. We've all got to play to
win.' "
"Shit, it was tight going into
those doubles matches," Wright
continued. "But we went out
after them. Everybody was
keyed."
Mitchin'
"Matt is a team leader," Gould
said. "Those words got the guys
thinking in the right way."
The Cards won two of their
doubles matches and defaulted
the third. Mitchell-Wright de
feated Giammalva-Gottfried,
6-4, 6-2; Rennert-Hodges
crushed Benson-Reese, 6-2, 6-0;
and Iskersky-McKown won by
default over Maze-Rast, 2-6, 1-0.
Maze was suffering from leg
cramps.

"I've got to give Perry an awful
lot of credit,"Gould said. "When
he started on the team his
freshman year he was No. 17 on

the team. Last year he moved up
to the bottom of the lineup after
Nick Saviano turned pro and
Gene Mayer hurt his back. He's
just come through like crazy.
That just epitomizes this year's
team."
Every player will be back next
year. The team is young — three
freshmen competed in the
NCAAs. And Gould has re
cruited the No. 1 junior player in
the nation for next year. Does he
expect to build a dynasty?
King Richard?
"Hey, I tell you," Gould said.
"All the teams are young. Trinity
has four freshmen this year. A
champion in any sport can't get
too high. We won today but we
might not win tomorrow. We've
got to come out fightin' like
crazy."
Today individual competition
begins with 16 singles and dou
bles teams involved. The Cards
have three players involved in
singles competition: Mitchell,

who is seeded No. 1, Maz6, No. 4
and Wright, No. 14. Mitchell-
Wright are seeded first in dou
bles.
"Winning the team champ
ionship takes a lot of pressure off
us," said Wright. "Otherwise I'd
have gone into the singles and
doubles competition either jeal
ous or mad that we didn't win
knd that we'd have to wait
another year.
"Tomorrow I'm going to go
out and concentrate really hard
and try to win. Right now I'm a
little tired but 1 feel really good
and loose."
Mark Mitchell, Matt's brother
and a member of the 1974 NCAA
championship team, said after
watching this week's tourney:
"This team is more eager than
ours was. The three freshmen
wanted it really bad. It was a
kind of Utopia they were search
ing for. That freshman spirit car
ried the team all the way

Sophomore Ail-American Matt Mitchell led the Cards to an NCAA team championship yesterday in
Athens, Ga. Stanford defeated Trinity, 5-4. Mitchell downed frosh Tony Giammalva, 6-3,7-6 (5-3)
and moves into today's singles and doubles championships seeded No. 1.
Can you believe we won?"
screamed Perry Wright into the

some champagne. It's such a rush."
Stanford's tennis team copped its
'hird NCAA team championship in
five years — the second NCAA team
championship for Stanford this
academic school year, an historic
first on the Farm.
Stanford, ranked behind Trinity
all season, downed the Tigers, 5-4
yesterday, to capture the team title
in Athens, Ca. Trinity had beaten
the Cards, 6-3, last February at the
National Intercollegiate Indoor
championships in Madison, Wis.
"I'm really happy," said coach
Dick Could. When Gould took over
the coaching duties here 10 years
ago, the Cards were ranked 33rd in
the country.
We can do it
'Here's a team that came through

Trinity took first and Stanford sec

has a chance.' They did everything I
told them to — some things were a
little unreasonable.

Frosh sensation
Jim Hodges, a freshman from Chevy Chase, Md., combined forces with
teammate Peter Rennert to defeat Trinity's team of Dave Benson and Eddie
Reese, 6-2, 6-0 and clinch the NCAA title for the Cards.
"But the key to the win lies in
the fact that they competed well
every time they had to. If we got
beat, we got beat and we never
sat on a loss."
To beat Trinity yesterday,
Stanford had some long, hard
matches which demanded both
mental and physical stamina.
Sophomore Ail-American
Matt Mitchell (S) defeated Tony
Giammalva (T), 6-3, 7-6 (5-3 tie
breaker); Brian Gottfried (T) beat
Bill Maze (S), 7-5, 4-6, 6-3; Erick
Iskersky (T) defeated Perry
Wright (S), 7-5, 7-6 (5-3); Ben
McKown (T) blasted Jim Hodges
(S), 6-2, 6-2; John Rast (S)
downed Eddie Reese (T), 7-6
(5-1), 6-2; and Lloyd Bourne (S)
smashed Mike Davisdon (T), 6-2,
6-0.
The Cards went into doubles
competition tied three-all.
And Matt Mitchell had a little
talk with the team.
"Matt was great," Wright said.

"He said, 'Fuck, it's just another
match. But we don't want to be
No. 2. We've all got to play to
win.' "
"Shit, it was tight going into
those doubles matches," Wright
continued. "But we went out
after them. Everybody was
keyed."
Mitchin'
"Matt is a team leader," Gould
said. "Those words got the guys
thinking in the right way."
The Cards won two of their
doubles matches and defaulted
the third. Mitchell-Wright de
feated Giammalva-Gottfried,
6-4, 6-2; Rennert-Hodges
crushed Benson-Reese, 6-2, 6-0;
and Iskersky-McKown won by
default over Maze-Rast, 2-6, 1-0.
Maze was suffering from leg
cramps.

"I've got to give Perry an awful
lot of credit,"Gould said. "When
he started on the team his

the team. Last year he moved up
to the bottom of the lineup after
Nick Saviano turned pro and
Gene Mayer hurt his back. He's
just come through like crazy.
That just epitomizes this year's
team."
Every player will be back next
year. The team is young — three
freshmen competed in the
NCAAs. And Gould has re
cruited the No. 1 junior player in
the nation for next year. Does he
expect to build a dynasty?
King Richard?
"Hey, I tell you," Gould said.
"All the teams are young. Trinity
has four freshmen this year. A
champion in any sport can't get
too high. We won today but we
might not win tomorrow. We've
got to come out fightin' like
crazy."
Today individual competition
begins with 16 singles and dou
bles teams involved. The Cards
have three players involved in
singles competition: Mitchell,

who is seeded No. 1, Maz6, No. 4
and Wright, No. 14. Mitchell-
Wright are seeded first in dou
bles.
"Winning the team champ
ionship takes a lot of pressure off
us," said Wright. "Otherwise I'd
have gone into the singles and
doubles competition either jeal
ous or mad that we didn't win
knd that we'd have to wait
another year.
"Tomorrow I'm going to go
out and concentrate really hard
and try to win. Right now I'm a
little tired but 1 feel really good
and loose."
Mark Mitchell, Matt's brother
and a member of the 1974 NCAA
championship team, said after
watching this week's tourney:
"This team is more eager than
ours was. The three freshmen
wanted it really bad. It was a
kind of Utopia they were search

ried the team all the way
through."

Mark Mitchell, Matt's brother
and a member of the 1974 NCAA
championship team, said after
watching this week's tourney:
"This team is more eager than
ours was. The three freshmen
wanted it really bad. It was a

ried the team all the way
through."

No. 1 fella
Sophomore Ail-American Matt Mitchell led the Cards to an NCAA team championship yesterday in
Athens, Ga. Stanford defeated Trinity, 5-4. Mitchell downed frosh Tony Giammalva, 6-3,7-6 (5-3)
and moves into today's singles and doubles championships seeded No. 1.
Can you believe we won?"
screamed Perry Wright into the
phone yesterday. "It's unbelieva
ble. I've already had a few beers and
some champagne. It's such a rush."
Stanford's tennis team copped its
'hird NCAA team championship in
five years — the second NCAA team
championship for Stanford this
academic school year, an historic
first on the Farm.
Stanford, ranked behind Trinity
all season, downed the Tigers, 5-4
yesterday, to capture the team title
in Athens, Ca. Trinity had beaten
the Cards, 6-3, last February at the
National Intercollegiate Indoor
championships in Madison, Wis.
"I'm really happy," said coach
Dick Could. When Gould took over
the coaching duties here 10 years
ago, the Cards were ranked 33rd in
the country.
We can do it
'Here's a team that came through
all year long," Gould said. "After
the nationals in Madison (where
Trinity took first and Stanford sec
ond), 1 thought 'Here's a team that
has a chance.' They did everything I
told them to — some things were a
little unreasonable.

Frosh sensation
Jim Hodges, a freshman from Chevy Chase, Md., combined forces with
teammate Peter Rennert to defeat Trinity's team of Dave Benson and Eddie
Reese, 6-2, 6-0 and clinch the NCAA title for the Cards.
"But the key to the win lies in
the fact that they competed well
every time they had to. If we got
beat, we got beat and we never
sat on a loss."
To beat Trinity yesterday,
Stanford had some long, hard
matches which demanded both
mental and physical stamina.
Sophomore Ail-American
Matt Mitchell (S) defeated Tony
Giammalva (T), 6-3, 7-6 (5-3 tie
breaker); Brian Gottfried (T) beat
Bill Maze (S), 7-5, 4-6, 6-3; Erick
Iskersky (T) defeated Perry
Wright (S), 7-5, 7-6 (5-3); Ben
McKown (T) blasted Jim Hodges
(S), 6-2, 6-2; John Rast (S)
downed Eddie Reese (T), 7-6
(5-1), 6-2; and Lloyd Bourne (S)
smashed Mike Davisdon (T), 6-2,
6-0.
The Cards went into doubles
competition tied three-all.
And Matt Mitchell had a little
talk with the team.
"Matt was great," Wright said.

"He said, 'Fuck, it's just another
match. But we don't want to be
No. 2. We've all got to play to
win.' "
"Shit, it was tight going into
those doubles matches," Wright
continued. "But we went out
after them. Everybody was
keyed."
Mitchin'
"Matt is a team leader," Gould
said. "Those words got the guys
thinking in the right way."
The Cards won two of their
doubles matches and defaulted
the third. Mitchell-Wright de
feated Giammalva-Gottfried,
6-4, 6-2; Rennert-Hodges
crushed Benson-Reese, 6-2, 6-0;
and Iskersky-McKown won by
default over Maze-Rast, 2-6, 1-0.
Maze was suffering from leg
cramps.

"I've got to give Perry an awful
lot of credit,"Gould said. "When
he started on the team his
freshman year he was No. 17 on

the team. Last year he moved up
to the bottom of the lineup after
Nick Saviano turned pro and
Gene Mayer hurt his back. He's
just come through like crazy.
That just epitomizes this year's
team."
Every player will be back next
year. The team is young — three
freshmen competed in the
NCAAs. And Gould has re
cruited the No. 1 junior player in
the nation for next year. Does he
expect to build a dynasty?
King Richard?
"Hey, I tell you," Gould said.
"All the teams are young. Trinity
has four freshmen this year. A
champion in any sport can't get
too high. We won today but we
might not win tomorrow. We've
got to come out fightin' like
crazy."
Today individual competition
begins with 16 singles and dou
bles teams involved. The Cards
have three players involved in
singles competition: Mitchell,

who is seeded No. 1, Maz6, No. 4
and Wright, No. 14. Mitchell-
Wright are seeded first in dou
bles.
"Winning the team champ
ionship takes a lot of pressure off
us," said Wright. "Otherwise I'd
have gone into the singles and
doubles competition either jeal
ous or mad that we didn't win
knd that we'd have to wait
another year.
"Tomorrow I'm going to go
out and concentrate really hard
and try to win. Right now I'm a
little tired but 1 feel really good
and loose."

and a member of the 1974 NCAA
