# In black Africa
## Cuban influence growing 
### 
Maputo, Mozambique (AP) — The Cuban pre
sence in Africa, a cause of growing anxiety in the
West, has spread to 10 black countries. An esti
mated 20,000 Cubans are running farms and hospi
tals, training black armies and preaching Marxist
revolution.
The latest African country to welcome Cuban
assistance is Ethiopia, whose Marxist military
government expelled a large number of Americans
last month.
According to the U.S. State Department, 50
Cuban military technicians have arrived in
Ethiopia, although President Fidel Castro claims
they are only diplomatic personnel and doctors.
State Department spokesman Nodding Carter
says it "could be a serious development" if the
Cubans are an advance party for hundreds more.
However, U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young says
the Cubans "might be a little more rational" than
the Ethiopians and help cool down internal disor
ders that have claimed hundreds of lives.
Cubans are also believed to be in Mozambique,
Guinea-Bissau, Tanzania, Guinea, Equatorial
Guinea, Sierra Leone, the Congo Republic,
Somalia and Angola. Someare working as doctors,
others as technicians, military advisers and
teachers.
"We are not only a Latin American nation," Cas
tro boasted recently. "We are a Latin African na
tion."
Cuba's influence in Africa has been gradually
increasing since 1964 when Castro began assisting
a liberation movement in Guinea; it grabbed the
world's attention in 1975 when some 15,000
Cuban troops helped the Marxist Popular Move
ment win the Angolan civil war.
The Cuban presence remains most visible in
Angola, a former Portuguese colony.
"Currently Cubans can be seen everywhere
working as advisers and experts," according to an
eyewitness account dist'ibuted by the Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug.
"Besides the 10,000 to 15,000 Cuban soldiers,
officers and instructors, now Cuban experts and
advisers can be seen in every rank in the govern
ment apparatus and in the economy. They are pre
sent everywhere and very active."
Western journalists find it difficult to obtain
entry permits to visit most African countries where
Cubans are active.
Tanjug said Cubans "even sit on business desks

as Angolan representatives when deals are
negotiated with foreign firms."
"The Yankee imperialists say that the Cuban
comrades come to exploit Angola," said Angolan
Prime Minister Lopo do Nascimento. "But Cuba
has no concessions in Angola, no oil, no mines, no
forests.
"They are here with clean hands. The Ameri
cans have concessions in our country, not the Cu
bans. The Cubans don't have them and never will."
In other African countries, Cubans are less visi
ble. Visitors see them occasionally at sidewalk
cafes, sipping strong, black coffee and puffing
their famous cigars.
Their olive-green uniforms, baseball caps and
swarthy complexions betray their identity.
There is a blanket of secrecy, however, over Cu
ba's role in providing military advisers to black
nationalist movements fighting white govern
ments in Rhodesia and South-West Africa —
Namibia.
Guerrilla training camps in southern Angola,
Mozambique and Tanzania — believed supervised
by Cubans — are off limits to journalists. Western
diplomats can only assume Cubans are there.
Castro told a recent meeting in Havana that aid
to Africa "has taken different forms. Sometimes we
give weapons, on other occasions we have sent
men. We have sent military instructors, or doctors
or construction workers."
Like black American diplomats, the Cubans
stress their ties to Africa, pointing out that one
fourth of Cuba's 9.5 million people are black.
Cuban support of black nationalist movements
in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau paid
off when those groups took over the governments.
But the history of Cuba's role in the continent is
not without its setbacks. Cuba befriended the lef
tist regime of kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, but he
was ousted by a coup in 1966. The Cubans were
expelled.
Two years later, the Republic of the Congo threw
out most of several hundred Cuban advisers,
claiming they were meddling in internal affairs.
They returned in 1973 after a leftist regime took
power.
"They will return to their land one day when we
decide so, the same way they came, as friends of
our people and without dollars in their pockets,"
Angolan Prime Minister do Nascimento said.
