# Young calls Swedes 'racists'

Stockholm, Sweden (AF) —
The Swedish press gave promi
nent display yesterday to Am
bassador Andrew Young's cal
ling the Swedes "terrible ra
cists." In New York, a borough
official reacted angrily to
Young's accompanying remark
that "when the crunch comes,
the black in Sweden is treated
just like the black in Queens."
The black ambassador to the
United Nations commented on
Sweden and Queens during a
wide-ranging discussion of ra
cism Wednesday as he flew to
London from Sudan, the last
stop on his African tour. He left
for Washington yesterday.
In the discussion, he said he
intends no condemnation when
he uses the term "racist,"adding
the only places where racism is
on the decline is where it is
under constant discussion, as in
the American South.

In New York, the Queen
borough president, Donald
Manes, labelled Young's com
ment "incredible." He ques
tioned whether the ambassador
"knows anything about Queens
other than an area he drives
through from an airport to the
U.N."
Manes said, "The residents of
Queens represent all races, relig
ions, creeds and nationalistic
groups and have established an
outstanding record of working
and living together in har
mony."
In an interview, the editor of
the Aftonbladet and an outspo
ken critic of American involve
ment in Indochina, Gunnar Fre
dericksson, admitted there was a
growing distrust of foreigners in
Sweden "but I think we are
neither better nor worse than
other nations."
In recent months, Swedish

newspapers have reported
widely on the treatment of
foreign workers in the country,
including long delays in receiv
ing work permits, an indication
prejudice against foreigners is
increasing among many Swedes.
But most problems with
foreigners in Sweden stem from
the lack of integrated housing for
many of the 500,000 foreigners
in the country and fear their con
tinued presence will put Swedes
out of work. The economy is un
certain following a recent series
of emergency measures by the
center-right government which
may change the welfare orienta
tion of the previous Socialist
government.
A foreign ministry official said
his office felt "limited en
thusiasm" over Young's re
marks, adding "We want to
know a bit more if we are going
to comment on this at all."
