# Customs reads U.S. mail

Denver (AP) — The CIA may
have stopped opening first-class
mail entering the United States,
but not the U.S. Customs Service
— even though a court order
prohibits the practice.
While a government appeal of
the ruling is before the U.S. Sup
reme Court, the Customs Service
is continuing to open an average
of 400 first-class letters a day in
Los Angeles.
A customs official said similar
mail openings without a warrant
continue at such ports as San
Francisco, Miami, Chicago and
New York.
David Arnon, a Customs Ser
vice official in Los Angeles,
cited a 1971 ruling by the 10th
Circuit of the U.S. Court of Ap
peals in Denver which he said
permits opening of such mail
without permission. In a more
recent ruling, however, a federal
appeals court in Washington,
D.C., said Customs can't open
overseas mail without a court
order.
Justice Department attorneys
appealed that ruling to the Sup
reme Court this spring, saying
customs officials open more
than one billion pieces of first
class mail, packages and other
mail annually.
They added that 23 million
envelopes from selected coun
tries are set aside and about
270,000 are opened, most of
them first-class mail. Of those
opened, federal attorneys ar
gued, one in six contains con
traband.
The Supreme Court is ex
pected to rule on the question
before its term ends in late June.
