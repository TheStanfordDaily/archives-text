-1 have recently heard rumors
concerning Roble Hal I, and 1 was
wondering if you could put some
of them to rest.
Is the ivy going to be removed
from the walls? Also, are the
trees at the corner ofLomita and
Santa Teresa going to be re
placed by a parking lot for the
new Terman Engineering Build
ing?
-P.E.
Robert Ramirez, manager for
University housing, said there
are "no plans to remove the ivy
from the walls."
There is, however, an annual
trim where the ivy is cut from
around the windows, but hope
fully the ivy will drape the walls
of Roble for many years to come.
(Some people think that the
building will collapse if the ivy
is removed!)
As for the parking lot, that will
also not become a reality. Ac
cording to Gary Rotzin, assistant
to the manager of construction
and engineering, "no way would
we remove those trees!"

,As a resident of Toyon Hull, I
was wondering why the water
that comes out of our taps and
water fountains smells and
tastes so incredibly bad. Are we
being punished for some un
known and horrible offense?
-8.A.8.
Once again I turned to Robert
Ramirez, and he informed me
that the pipes in Toyon are going
to be replaced this summer.
"They're over 50 years old," he
said, "nothing unsafe, but the
water has begun to acqu ire a par
ticular taste."
So cheer up Toyonites. After
the summer renovation, the
water should taste and smell as
water should. Just remember to
conserve it!

Is the University still watering
down tennis courts on campus?
If so, how much?
-F.E.D.
For the varsity and Encina
courts, 1 called Frank Cardoza,
groundskeeper for athletic
facilities. He informed me that
the courts are not regularly
cleaned, and when they are,
"Dick Gould (varsity tennis
coach) is the one who gives the
order."
Due to the, recent water shor
tage, he said, the courts are no
longer cleaned using water. In
stead, they are now swept manu

ally', and he remarked, "It's
kinda tough."
At Roble courts, Cindy Can
non said the groundskeeper,
Herman Fischer, never uses
water to wash the courts — in
stead, a blower is used.
There was however one excep
tion when a party was held on
the courts. Due to beer spilled all
over the courts, water had to be
used to wash the courts.

I recently learned that federal,
state and local government
agencies can obtain photocopies
of a person's cancelled checks
and bunk credit card receipts
from a bunk. These records are
turned over when the govern
ment agency presents something
called an administrative sub
poena.
Agency officials fill out these
subpoenas on their own. Their
issuance does not involve a
court hearing. Apparently some
banks notify their customer after
his or her records have been
turned over to the government.
Do any California banks in the
Stanford area tell their custom-

ers about such subpoenas?
-W.M.E.
After many referrals, I was fi
nally put in contact with Lane
Brennan, head of the Legal De
partment for WelJs Fargo Bank.
When I called him at his San
Francisco office and confronted
him with the question, he com
mented: "This is no longer so.
We (Wells Fargo) always notify
the customer beforehand."
He went on to tell me that after
a Feb. 1977 ruling, the customer
must always be notified. When
the bank receives a summons to
which the customer has a right to
object, he or she is given 14 days
to notify the bank, in which case
the bank will re/use to release
the records.
Brennan also stated that most
banks he knows give notice in
every case, even if it is one to
which the customer cannot ob
