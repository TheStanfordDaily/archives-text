# Co-operative living at 549 Lasuen
## Columbae dwellers: happy, mellowed-out, politically aware 
### Karen Koman 
(Editor's note: The following de
scription of Columbae House
was written before the weekly
clean-up when, in the words of
the author, "it looked much
better."
Freshly painted shutters and
stately green pillars characterize
the exterior of Columbae. The
house exudes the allure of a
graceful Southern mansion in
the days of the old southern aris
tocracy. Inside, it looks likeCen
eral Sherman and a battery of
troops have just tramped
through. Holes gape through the
worn carpets, the bathrooms
smell, and a state of organized
clutter reigns in the rest of the
house. Thirty-seven people have
been crammed into a living area
designed for 30. Something or
someone's gotta give.
The psychological well-being
of the constituents of Columbae,
however, is easily determined.
People are happy here. The term
"mellowed out" might be used.
States one resident: "Columbae
is the only place on campus that
people can live as human be
ings." A freshman woman, a
one-quarter resident, puts it a bit
more believably: "Living here at
Columbae has made my
freshman year."
Home for 'Change'
Columbae is the home of the
Alliance for Radical Change,
the Against the Grain news
paper, the now-defunct David
Harris campaign and several
SWOPSI courses on alternative
lifestyles. And then there are the
infamous back rubs. . . .
The motto of the house is "so
cial change through non
violence" and according to resi
dent Wayne Sachs, "eating beef
here is considered a political
act."
Sachs is a senior majoring in
American Studies. He is short,
bearded, and is among those
who have lived the longest in the
house (two years). (Note: last
year, only five prior residents re
turned.) He is also somewhat
ambiguous in his feelings about
the house: "I have been
burned-out on Columbae for one
year, and I've been moving out
for the past seven months."

Although he praises the sup
portive atmosphere that the
co-op engenders, he is quick to
note the dependency that often
follows. "If you live in Stern, you
can go into your room and just
shut your door." At Columbae,
it's different.
"Here, you're dependent on
people for your food, for quiet,
and to some degree, for your pri
vacy. There's also a constant flux
of new people coming into the
house and it takes some getting
used to on your part while they
learn how to cook and fit in with
the general routine," said Sachs.
Notes another resident: "Living
here is a responsibility. In a
dorm, you're picked up after,
given food, and practically
spoon-fed."
Columbae is a co-op in all
senses of the word, from order
ing and cooking the food down
to cleaning bathrooms. And it
would appear that its residents
enjoy the responsibility.
"There's no hierarchy here,
with a certain elite group mak
ing all the decisions. We make
all the decisions about the house
by consensus, which means that
everyone has got to agree," said
one resident. "Sometimes this
can be a long tedious process. (A
few weeks ago) for example, we
had a 15 hour meeting on room
ing arrangements which lasted
until five in the morning."
Room changing
Terry Pollach. with a cowboy
hat covering his wavy black hair
and his feet clad in huirache
sandals, sat amidst the clutter of
his new room. Every quarter,
people in Columbae change
rooms in order to make the new
residents feel more at home. Pol
lach is a transfer student from
Amherst, who's been living off
campus until last quarter. For
him, Columbae is "a good place
for sensitive people, not your
run-of-the-mill college kid. Col
umbae is sort of a transition
point, a 'Halfway House' bet
ween college and the real world.
It's also a good place to try and
figure out why you're doing
what you're doing."
Another resident added that
"there's a very definite socializa
tion process when you first enter

Columbae. You have to change
your lifestyle, your attitudes,
and get used to a new diet.
There's more warmth, more in
timacy here. One good thing is
that you feel free to walk up to
anyone in the house and just hug
them whenever you feel like it.
Or grab someone's ass — usual ly
a guy's, cause it's funnier." Adds
Pollach, "people are not that 'to
gether' in the dorms. Dorms are
institutions, with rules."
The food at Columbae is cer
tainly not institutionalized
Sternburgers. A typical dinner
menu (breakfast and lunch are

free-for-alls) includes a broccoli
quiche, stir-fried vegetables,
soup, and salad. Some form of
bean dish is usually inevitable.
There seems to be no general
"consensus" on the quality of
the food, however. Remarks
range from:"the food's wonder
ful here, I love it," to "you know,
I really like this place, but the
food sucks. I'd rather go eat in a
dorm!"
One problem at the beginning
of each quarter is new residents
who have yet to try their hand at
cooking. Palates suffer while the
neophytes make their initial

blunders. Often residents find
that a vegetarian diet doesn't
offer quite the variety they had
anticipated.
Cooking groups
All the residents are divided
into cooking groups of six who
perform chef's duties once a
week. They are responsible for
preparing the meal, whipping
up the co-op mainstays of
yogurt, granola and bread, and
cleaning up afterward. All this
usually takes about four hours a
week.
The house is cleaned once a
week, with each person's turn

coming up about three times a
quarter. According to Sachs,
"clean-up takes a Sunday after
noon. If I'm hung over, it takes a
little longer. ..
How much time a person de
votes to Columbae is his or her
own decision. There are 15 man
agerial positions in the house,
which change every month in
order to give everyone a chance
to participate.
"Some people devote a mini
mal amount of time, while others
really get involved, organizing
house activities or going 'or
ganic' in the garden," said one
resident. "But sometimes, the
smell of that fresh manure in the
garden, it's well . . . hmmmm!"
Open to new ideas
Tom Wainwright, a senior in
his seventh quarter at Columbae,
says that he's changed a lot in the
time he's spent there. "The
people here are very open to
change, to new ideas. One of the
best things about this place is
that the people are so accepting
of you and whatever lifestyle
you choose to have. There are no
minorities here. Also, if people
know that you're having prob
lems, they'll go out of their way
to try and help."
Wainwright mentioned the
high drop-out rate of Columbae
residents. "There's a large con
flict here between studies, poli
tics, and other activities, as far as
time and energy go. People who
come in are overwhelmed by all
the new ideas and options that
they're suddenly being exposed
to. Many find that Stanford is
just not as important to their
lives as they used to think it
was."
While some people have
likened Columbae to the closest
thing at Stanford to the "Real

World," sophomore Bryan Col
eman is one resident who feels
differently. "Columbae is really
isolated from the real world. The
lifestyles here are all very diffe
rent and not a part of the
mainstream. You can do things
here and not worry about accep
tance," he said. "There's less
bother about stereotypes."
Political awareness
One thing he feels is espe
cially good about Columbae is
the high degree of political
awareness. "After 1 lived here for
awhile, I began to realize how
much false pressure was gener
ated from academics. People are
being screwed over in South Af
rica while people here are worry
ing about their studies. (Note:
this interview took place before
the 920-person rally concerning
the University's investment
policies in South Africa took
place.) It seems kind of out of
proportion."
Laura Wagner, a freshman, has
lived in Columbae for one quar
ter. She credits Columbae with
heightening her political aware
ness and developing her
feminism. She said of Columbae,
"the style here is loose, but
things can get heavy. After a
while, you start to feel a little
stronger. But if you weigh it
against other factors.. . no one
moves back into the dorms after
Columbae."
While there is a great amount
of political awareness in the
house, Wagner notes the lack of
peer pressure. "There's no real
coercion to 'get involved' here.
Actually, there really aren't that
many politically active people
here — just like in the rest of the
world. There's really more of an
informational activism at work
here."


Home of change
Columbae is home for the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Against the Grain ('radical'
on-campus newspaper), and the now-defunct

currently live in the house, which was designed
to hold 30.
