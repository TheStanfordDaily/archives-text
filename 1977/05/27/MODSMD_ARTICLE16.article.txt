# Stanford enologists rate California wines
## 
### Harry Killas A recent New York Times ar 
tide suggested that California
viliters have exaggerated the
aging potential of the besl
California wines. With excep
tions, The Times noted, "ever
superior vintages, such as 196£

and 1970, do not seem to be im
proving in the bottle."
However, most experts agree
that 1973 and 1974 Cabernet
Sanvignons and Zinfandels
made in the robust, strong style,
can use three to five more years
of bottle age. Favorable summer
weather in 1973 resulted in a
bumper crop of good quality
grapes. In a blind tasting in
Paris, French experts ranked the
1973 Stag's Leap Cabernet first
over several Mi'docs.
1974 had a cool summer and a
warm dry fall, allowing for ex
cellent harvest conditions such
as a long slow maturation. In
fact, it is very likely that 1973
and 1974 will go on record as
two of California's finest vin
tages. On the other hand, 1975

and 1976 are generally disap
pointing; the drought's effect on
the wine industry is anyone's
guess.
The recent tasting of Zinfan
del by 33 participating tasters at
Lagunita dining hall de
monstrated the difference bet
ween the two styles of winemak
ing: heavy and tannic wines
with much longevity, and
lighter wines ready for im
mediate consumption.
The 1974 Chateau Montelena
($5.50) placed first. Although
less tannic than Montelena's
Cabernet, this wine still had
good balance and exhibited the
berrylike Zinfandel character.
The gutsy 1975 Montevina, a
great buy at $4, was more full
bodied and dark-hued than the

Montelena: it placed second.
Equally impressive was the
1974 Cuvaison ($5.50), but its
acidity and austerity threw off
the tasters, who ranked it only
seventh. This austerity indicates
that the Cuvaison (like the Mon
tevina) has great aging potential.
Tied for second place was the
1973 Sutter Home Zinfandel
($3.75).
Two weeks earlier, 35 rankers
tasted 16California "Jug" wines.
Spitoons were provided; it was
reportedly a rowdy tasting.
Whereas Zinfandel and Cabernet
Savignon are varietal wines
(wines that contain at least 51
per cent of the grape named on
the bottle), jug wines are generic.
Generic wines are blends of
several grape varieties; their

names convey the type of Euro
pean wine that they supposedly
resemble. Popular California
generic names are Chablis, Bur
gundy, Claret and Sauterne. No
generic is vintage-dated.
The Parducci Chablis ($3.19/ l / 2
gallon), the Los Hermanos Reisl
ing ($3.19/ magnum) and the Los
Hermanos Chardonnay ($3.19/
magnum) were all deemed good
bets.
The top four red jug wines
were the Barengo Zinfandel
($3.29/V2 gallon), the Kenwood
Burgundy ($2.95), the irrepres
sible Gallo Hearty Burgundy
($2.59) and Gemello Zinfandel
($3.50).

superior vintages, such as 196£

and 1970, do not seem to be im
proving in the bottle."
However, most experts agree
that 1973 and 1974 Cabernet
Sanvignons and Zinfandels
made in the robust, strong style,
can use three to five more years
of bottle age. Favorable summer
weather in 1973 resulted in a
bumper crop of good quality
grapes. In a blind tasting in
Paris, French experts ranked the
1973 Stag's Leap Cabernet first
over several Mi'docs.
1974 had a cool summer and a
warm dry fall, allowing for ex
cellent harvest conditions such
as a long slow maturation. In
fact, it is very likely that 1973
and 1974 will go on record as
two of California's finest vin
tages. On the other hand, 1975

and 1976 are generally disap
pointing; the drought's effect on
the wine industry is anyone's
guess.
The recent tasting of Zinfan
del by 33 participating tasters at
Lagunita dining hall de
monstrated the difference bet
ween the two styles of winemak
ing: heavy and tannic wines
with much longevity, and
lighter wines ready for im
mediate consumption.
The 1974 Chateau Montelena
($5.50) placed first. Although
less tannic than Montelena's
Cabernet, this wine still had
good balance and exhibited the
berrylike Zinfandel character.
The gutsy 1975 Montevina, a
great buy at $4, was more full
bodied and dark-hued than the

Montelena: it placed second.
Equally impressive was the
1974 Cuvaison ($5.50), but its
acidity and austerity threw off
the tasters, who ranked it only
seventh. This austerity indicates
that the Cuvaison (like the Mon
tevina) has great aging potential.
Tied for second place was the
1973 Sutter Home Zinfandel
($3.75).
Two weeks earlier, 35 rankers
tasted 16California "Jug" wines.
Spitoons were provided; it was
reportedly a rowdy tasting.
Whereas Zinfandel and Cabernet
Savignon are varietal wines
(wines that contain at least 51
per cent of the grape named on
the bottle), jug wines are generic.
Generic wines are blends of
several grape varieties; their

names convey the type of Euro
pean wine that they supposedly
resemble. Popular California
generic names are Chablis, Bur
gundy, Claret and Sauterne. No
generic is vintage-dated.
The Parducci Chablis ($3.19/ l / 2
gallon), the Los Hermanos Reisl
ing ($3.19/ magnum) and the Los
Hermanos Chardonnay ($3.19/
magnum) were all deemed good
bets.
The top four red jug wines
were the Barengo Zinfandel
($3.29/V2 gallon), the Kenwood
Burgundy ($2.95), the irrepres
sible Gallo Hearty Burgundy
($2.59) and Gemello Zinfandel
($3.50).
