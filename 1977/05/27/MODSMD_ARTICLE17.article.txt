"On a certain day in Sep
tember, sdected by my grand
mother fo- its auspiciousness,"
writes R.K Narayan in his recent
autobiogaphy, My Days, "I
bought ai exercise book and
wrote the irst line of a novel; as I
sat in a nom nibbling my pen
and woniering what to write,
Malgudi vith its little railway
station swam into view, all
ready-m.de, with a charac
ter. .. That was almost a half
century tgo. Today, with 11
novels piolished, all set in Mal

developed which has remained
with me ever since," he writes.
Unhappy experience
He includes a chapter on his
brief, unhappy experience with
the Indian film industry during
the movie production of his
novel, The Guide. The book,
which won him the National
Prize of the Indian Literary
Academy, failed both as a film
and as a Broadway play. He at
tributes the failures to bizarre
departures from the novel: the
film glamorized the heroine and
the city of Malgudi completely
out of character and milieu; the
Broadway play abolished the
heroine and added two irrelev
ant characters. My Days is writ
ten in spare, delicate, mildly
ironic style. So is much of his

aged aunt, who has been keeping
house, fussing over him all his
life. His great delight, since his
college days, has been buying
books at bargain prices at the an
tiquarian shop. His reading is
random.
To him, his resolve to live by
reason requires staying aloof
from women. It is not easy, with
all the female attentions toward
him.
His resolve is put to severe
strain when he meets Daisy, the
director of the local population
control office, who needs signs
painted. "What a name for
someone who looked so very In
dian, traditional, and gentle!" he
muses, fascinated.
At first he tries to resist this
fascination by practicing what

view contribute to the charm of Narayan's storytelling.'

himself India's foremost
novelist.
Narayan regards the rooted
ness of hisgrowing up in a joint
family as lighly significant in
his develojment as a writer. His
first novel Swami and Friends,
was publisied in 1935. Graham
Greene, wlo helped get it pub

the deathof Evelyn Waugh,
Narayan u the novelist I most
admire i» the English lan
guage."
In My Lays, Narayan reveals
some of tie parapsychological
backgroutd of his controversial
novel, TWi English Teacher,
which h» describes as "au
tobiograpiical in context — very
little of it b fiction." Profoundly
grieved hjthe early death of his
wife, Naryan for several years
had ceasd writing. He became
involvedin psychic experi

fiction.
Narayan's new novel, The
Painter of Signs, is his first major
piece of fiction after a gap of
nearly a decade. This novel
shows that modernity is begin
ning to move into Malgudi.
Raman, aMalgudi sign painter
in his '30s, strives to live by
reason, "determined to establish
the Age of Reason in the world."
But at the outset of the novel he
encounters a lawyer-client who
insists on having his sign board
painted with letters slanted to
the left because his astrologer
has advised him that "a left slant
is auspicious for my ruling star,
which is Saturn." Of course the
auspicious hour of affixing the
board has also been pinpointed
by the astrologer and must also
be observed. Raman scoffs, "I
want a rational explanation for
everything . . . otherwise my
mind refuses to accept any
statement." Nevertheless he de
livers, as business requires. This
illustrates sound middle-class
sense — one of the values
Narayan upholds in his novels.
Raman lives alone with his

"Mahatma Gandhi had advised
one of his followers in a similar
situation. 'Walk with your eyes
fixed on your toes during the
day, and on the stars at night.' "
Doesn't work. Next he tries dis
torting glasses which make her
look like the demoness Saroop
naka. Doesn't work, either.
Daisy is wholly committed to
her campaign for birth control:
"Our work must start right away,
before the monsoon begins, as it
has been observed that the birth
rate goes up during the monsoon
months." (Evidently, Indian
monsoons and New York
brownouts have identical re
sults). Raman accompanies Daisy
on her tours to villages, painting
signs for birth-control prop
aganda.
'Drawn together'
Raman and Daisy are increas
ingly drawn together; however,
she turns down his proposal for a
formal marriage. "We will begin
to live under the same roof on
any day we decide," Daisy says.
"And you will call yourself, Mrs.
So and So?" "No," she says. "1
won't change my name."

Further, she lays down two con
ditions before agreeing to live
with him; no children, and if by
mischance one is born it is to be
given away so that she would
remain free to pursue her social
work.
She's long held unconven
tional. independent views. Ear
lier she runs away from her pa
rents' home refusing to subject
herself to the bride-inspection
routine of an arranged marriage, -
even though she acknowledges
that the proposed bridegroom
"was not bad as bridegrooms
go." No doubt, women's libera
tion has arrived at Malgundi.
About time.
Raman's ancient aunt is
shocked by his involvement
with "this Christian girl" and
decides on a one-way pilgri mage
to Badrinath to spend her re
maining days by the holy Ganga.
Raman and Daisy live together
only briefly. They break up
when Daisy leaves for an ex
tended birth-control campaign.
Raman returns to his cronies at
the BoardlessCafe — "that solid,
real world of sublime souls who
minded their own business."
With this concluding sentence
of the novel Narayan reveals his
own conservative penchant for
proper relationships and not
meddling with other people's
business. But isn't birth control
everybody's business?
Narayan's writing style is ob
jective and spare. There are few
resonances of myth or metaphor
in his language. For this he has
been at times criticized, notably
by Professor V.Y. Kantak in his
well-known essay, "The Lan
guage of Indian Fiction in En
glish." On the other hand, it can
be cogently argued that simplic

third person point of view con

Unhappy experience
He includes a chapter on his
brief, unhappy experience with
the Indian film industry during
the movie production of his
novel, The Guide. The book,
which won him the National
Prize of the Indian Literary
Academy, failed both as a film
and as a Broadway play. He at
tributes the failures to bizarre
departures from the novel: the
film glamorized the heroine and
the city of Malgudi completely
out of character and milieu; the
Broadway play abolished the
heroine and added two irrelev
ant characters. My Days is writ

ironic style. So is much of his

aged aunt, who has been keeping
house, fussing over him all his
life. His great delight, since his
college days, has been buying
books at bargain prices at the an
tiquarian shop. His reading is
random.
To him, his resolve to live by
reason requires staying aloof
from women. It is not easy, with
all the female attentions toward
him.
His resolve is put to severe
strain when he meets Daisy, the
director of the local population
control office, who needs signs
painted. "What a name for

Raman, aMalgudi sign painter

painted with letters slanted to

has advised him that "a left slant

she turns down his proposal for a
formal marriage. "We will begin
to live under the same roof on
any day we decide," Daisy says.
"And you will call yourself, Mrs.

Unhappy experience
He includes a chapter on his
brief, unhappy experience with
the Indian film industry during
the movie production of his
novel, The Guide. The book,
which won him the National
Prize of the Indian Literary
Academy, failed both as a film
and as a Broadway play. He at
tributes the failures to bizarre
departures from the novel: the
film glamorized the heroine and
the city of Malgudi completely
out of character and milieu; the
Broadway play abolished the
heroine and added two irrelev
ant characters. My Days is writ
ten in spare, delicate, mildly
ironic style. So is much of his

aged aunt, who has been keeping
house, fussing over him all his
life. His great delight, since his
college days, has been buying
books at bargain prices at the an
tiquarian shop. His reading is
random.
To him, his resolve to live by
reason requires staying aloof
from women. It is not easy, with
all the female attentions toward
him.
His resolve is put to severe
strain when he meets Daisy, the
director of the local population
control office, who needs signs
painted. "What a name for
someone who looked so very In
dian, traditional, and gentle!" he
muses, fascinated.
At first he tries to resist this
fascination by practicing what

gudi, the fctional city of his cre
ation, Nartyan has established
himself India's foremost
novelist.
Narayan regards the rooted
ness of hisgrowing up in a joint
family as lighly significant in
his develojment as a writer. His
first novel Swami and Friends,
was publisied in 1935. Graham
Greene, wlo helped get it pub
lished, renntly wrote: "Since
the deathof Evelyn Waugh,
Narayan u the novelist I most
admire i» the English lan
guage."
In My Lays, Narayan reveals
some of tie parapsychological
backgroutd of his controversial
novel, TWi English Teacher,
which h» describes as "au
tobiograpiical in context — very
little of it b fiction." Profoundly
grieved hjthe early death of his
wife, Naryan for several years
had ceasd writing. He became
involvedin psychic experi
ments; h< quotes several de
tailed mesages he believes
came fronjthe spirit of his wife.
"Out of ill this experience a
view of pejonality or self or soul

fiction.
Narayan's new novel, The
Painter of Signs, is his first major
piece of fiction after a gap of
nearly a decade. This novel
shows that modernity is begin
ning to move into Malgudi.
Raman, aMalgudi sign painter
in his '30s, strives to live by
reason, "determined to establish
the Age of Reason in the world."
But at the outset of the novel he
encounters a lawyer-client who
insists on having his sign board
painted with letters slanted to
the left because his astrologer
has advised him that "a left slant
is auspicious for my ruling star,
which is Saturn." Of course the
auspicious hour of affixing the
board has also been pinpointed
by the astrologer and must also
be observed. Raman scoffs, "I
want a rational explanation for
everything . . . otherwise my
mind refuses to accept any
statement." Nevertheless he de
livers, as business requires. This
illustrates sound middle-class
sense — one of the values
Narayan upholds in his novels.
Raman lives alone with his

"Mahatma Gandhi had advised
one of his followers in a similar
situation. 'Walk with your eyes
fixed on your toes during the
day, and on the stars at night.' "
Doesn't work. Next he tries dis
torting glasses which make her
look like the demoness Saroop
naka. Doesn't work, either.
Daisy is wholly committed to
her campaign for birth control:
"Our work must start right away,
before the monsoon begins, as it
has been observed that the birth
rate goes up during the monsoon
months." (Evidently, Indian
monsoons and New York
brownouts have identical re
sults). Raman accompanies Daisy
on her tours to villages, painting
signs for birth-control prop
aganda.
'Drawn together'
Raman and Daisy are increas
ingly drawn together; however,
she turns down his proposal for a
formal marriage. "We will begin
to live under the same roof on
any day we decide," Daisy says.
"And you will call yourself, Mrs.
So and So?" "No," she says. "1
won't change my name."

Further, she lays down two con
ditions before agreeing to live
with him; no children, and if by
mischance one is born it is to be
given away so that she would
remain free to pursue her social
work.
She's long held unconven
tional. independent views. Ear
lier she runs away from her pa
rents' home refusing to subject
herself to the bride-inspection
routine of an arranged marriage, -
even though she acknowledges
that the proposed bridegroom
"was not bad as bridegrooms
go." No doubt, women's libera
tion has arrived at Malgundi.
About time.
Raman's ancient aunt is
shocked by his involvement
with "this Christian girl" and
decides on a one-way pilgri mage
to Badrinath to spend her re
maining days by the holy Ganga.
Raman and Daisy live together
only briefly. They break up
when Daisy leaves for an ex
tended birth-control campaign.
Raman returns to his cronies at
the BoardlessCafe — "that solid,
real world of sublime souls who
minded their own business."
With this concluding sentence
of the novel Narayan reveals his
own conservative penchant for
proper relationships and not
meddling with other people's
business. But isn't birth control
everybody's business?
Narayan's writing style is ob
jective and spare. There are few
resonances of myth or metaphor
in his language. For this he has
been at times criticized, notably
by Professor V.Y. Kantak in his
well-known essay, "The Lan
guage of Indian Fiction in En
glish." On the other hand, it can
be cogently argued that simplic
ity of language and objective
third person point of view con
tribute to the charm of Narayan's
storytelling.
In The Painter of Signs
Narayan presents a sharp por
trait of some of the shifting val
ues in Malgudi and in India to
day.
