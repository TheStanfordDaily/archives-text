# Top trustees seek investment review
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
President Richard Lyman and two
top trustees say they will recommend
formation of a committee to review
present investment guidelines and the
role of the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) when the Board of
Trustees meets in June.
Lyman, also a trustee, board presi
dent Peter Bing and trustee William
Eberle all indicated their willingness
to recommend a review of investment
policy at a meeting yesterday with five
members of the Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
I SCRIP).
Eberle suggested a November dead
line for recommendations from the
committee, saying, "We ought to re
think this process long before the
proxy season comes up."
There is no way the board can leg
ally delegate its responsibility to over
see University investments, however,
he added.
"My own sense is that the issue is
not likely to dwindle, that it is one we
will have to cope with (next year), one
we will have to take with maximum
seriousness," Lyman said.
A meeting between trustees and
students to discuss the University's
investments in South Africa and in
vestment policy in general was one of
the four demands made by protesters
at the Old Union sit-in on May 9.
Throughout the first 90 minutes of
discussion, the students repeatedly
pressed trustees to document claims
that U.S. corporations can act as prog
ressive forces in South Africa.
"I don't think a war of manifestos
will get us very far...l don't think you
would really think any differently if
t here were a lot of footnotes behi nd the
statements that have been made by the
trustees because they represent a fun
damentally different point of view,"
Lyman said.
"It's not a matter of point of view, it
is a matter of objective fact." said Peter
Necarsulmer, one of the students. "We
have yet to see one piece of objective
evidence.
"You can argue possibilities,"

Lyman said. "This just seems to me to
be an enormously more complex, sub
tle and difficult question than ever ap
pears in anything I've seen coming
from your (SCRIP's) movement."
Eberle emphasized that the trustees'
stand "is not a fixed position."
"We do not dispute your facts," said
Bing. "8ut..., you feel comfortable
with a conclusion I don't feel comfort
able with at this point, that the prefer
able choice is withdrawal.
"You may be right and we may be
wrong. Only the future is going to
tell."
