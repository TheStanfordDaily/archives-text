## Matt's come a long way 
### Jill Lieber 
Matt Mitchell, Stanford's No. 1 singles man,
has grown up a lot since last year. The sopho
more All-American is no longer the precocious
tennis brat who threw temper tantrums as well
as tennis racquets on the court.
The Palo Alto product goes into today's indi
vidual NCAA competition seeded No. 1 in sing
les and doubles after leading Stanford to its
NC,AA crown yesterday. "Mitch" won every set
in all three of his matches this week. His brother
Mark, under whose wing he played last year as a
freshman, has been at the tournament in
Athens, Ga. this week and he has noticed his
brother's growing maturity.
"Matt's handling the pressure pretty well,"
Mark said. "He started out really tight Monday
but he's gone out after the guys in every match
and he's not afraid anymore."
"Freshman year was a maturing process,"
said Matt. "There is a lot of pressure being on
one of the top teams in the country when you're
first starting out — especially one like Stan
ford's which has such an extremely high com
petitive drive.
"It's also different from high school because
you have to play for your school and not for
yourself. That puts a lot of weight on shoul
ders."
Mental maturity
Mitchell, this season's National Amateur In
doors singles and doubles champ as well as Ojai
Intercollegiate champ, said the mental attitude
of his game has matured more than the mechan
ical fundamentals.
"My overall confidence level is up," he said.
"I recognize I can do anything I want if I believe
in myself.
"Playing the Northwest circuit last summer
helped me tremendously. Six weeks of playing
by myself and for myself caused a lot of mental

growth. I found I could compete well with other
players."
Mitchell began tennis when he was seven and
a year later entered his first tournament.
"I cried when my parents signed me up for
tennis lessons," he said. "Everyone on my block
was playing little league or Pop Warner. Tennis
was a sissy sport.
"At my first lesson 1 whiffed every ball. None
went over the net. I've always thrived on com
petition and I loved the challenge trying to be
good at tennis. It didn't come easy. 1 really had
to work and work."
Win over Maze
The 5-foot-10 Mitchell won the Cards' No. 1
spot in March in a hotly contested challenge
match with Nor-Cal and Pac-8 champ, Bill
Maze. The challenge match, which went three
sets, marked the first time Mitchell had beaten
Maze, who played at the No. 1 spot a short time
last season.
"Naturally when you play your own team
mate there is a lot of pride at stake," Mitchell
said. "Somebody always gets hurt. I think the
loss shook Maze a bit but it didn't hurt him.
"You can make whatever you want out of
your position. I make the No. 1 spot a job. I don't
believe it should be glorified like others players
in the past did. It's more important to worry
about winning in a team way."
Mitchell is a perfectionist — which can be a
hindrance to his tennis.
"I have to hit every ball right or I'm not satis
fied," Mitchell said. "So 70 per cent of the time 1
don't feel good when I'm playing. Pros have
learned to accept things as they are and just go
out and play.
"I wouldn't want to feel totally satisfied after
every match. I always look for improvement.
I've got to strive to be the best."
