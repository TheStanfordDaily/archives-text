# Pleasing the gods

Overcast skies hung over the Temple of Athletics,
otherwise known as Roble Field, yesterday afternoon. But
the gods smiled upon Stanford-ln-Chichen-ltza.
Students in Prof. Ezra Zubrow's Anthropology 4 course
(Great People and Lost Sites) donned facial paint and
staged Pok-Ta-Tok (Mayan ball) for the second time since
the game was played by the ancient Mayans (another
game was played here last year).
"Classic Maya runs from about 600-900 A. D. and that's
when we know the ball courts existed. Then it gets kind of
fouled up because the next thing you hear about is at the
lime of contact, about 1500-1600 A.D. people talk about
the game in the Chronicles," said Zubrow.
"But it's kind of a passing reference and not very de
tailed. And as far as I know, since then, these are the only
two times it's ever been played," he added.
Rollerball forerunner
The game which was played yesterday was a blend of
rollerball, soccer and volleyball. The Mayans staged their
contests in a huge "/"-shaped field with stone walls run
ning all the way around. "It was like a large squash court
or swimming pool," said Zubrow.
Instead of using a stone court the students in teaching
assistant Lacy Atkinson's section built a pair of sloping
wooden walls with hoops attached. The ultimate goal in

Mayan ball is putting the ball through the hoop, but that
was a very rare happening. Yesterday nobody managed
a hoop shot.
"It is said that people would come down from the moun
tains to watch the game. There were so few goals scored
that when a person scored a goal he would go into the
crowd and take their clothes and jewelery. And it's said
that he was able to rampage and rape the ladies that were
in the crowd," said Atkinson.
Head for the hills
"Spectators would be watching this game that's very
intense and when ever a goal was scored they'd take off
and head for the hills.
"And each player would have his henchmen around to
hold the people there in case he made a goal. But one
man in his lifetime would probably make two or three
goals at the most."
But yesterday a modified version of the game was
used. Junior Jordan Schwartz put together a set of rules.
Points were scored in the following way - one point was
awarded for putting the ball in the soccer goal at each end
of the field, and two points were awarded for putting the
ball through a pair of pylons at each end of the"/"-shaped
field.
Jordan had some hints for anyone who wants to put on
the game again. "Make sure you have a good supply of

wood for the ball court and a civil engineer to draw up the
plans."
The game progressed with bodies colliding freely. Both
sides had more than a sprinkling of varsity football
players.
Wide receivers Bill Kellar, Vince Mulroy and David
Baum were on the winning Boland (Jaguar) team along
with Phil Francis, Gordy King, John Pyle, Connie Wool
ridge, Dan McCann, Charles Bedford, Billy Anderson and
Bubba Saylor.
Mayan ball marketable?
The game went so well that Schwartz is thinking about
trying to market a professional version of the game. "I
think as creator of the modern version, I'm going to try to
talk to entrepeneurs who might be interested in financing
a series of Mayan ball franchises," said Schwartz.
Asked if he saw any money making potential in market
ing the game, Jordan said, "I doubt it. I hope there's an 'A'
in this game somewhere."
A mock sacrifice was conducted after the game. The
Mayans sacrificed the captain of the losing team. But
when last seen, the losing captain was running towards
Hoover Tower.
To satisfy the gods, Atkinson was sacrificed by a
Mayan maiden.
The gods were pleased.
