Soviet airliner hijacked to Sweden
Stockholm, Sweden — An unarmed hijacker
commandeered a Soviet airliner yesterday over Lat
via and forced it to Stockholm — bluffing his way
West, he told Swedish police, by convincing a
stewardess he had explosives beneath his jacket.
Once on Swedish soil, in police custody and with
no explosives, he said he wanted refuge.
Stockholm police commissioned Hans Holmer
identified the man as a 37-year-old citizen of
Byelorussia, in the western Soviet Union bordering
Poland. Holmer said he stated under police ques
tioning that he staged the hijack after making a trial
run on the plane the day before.
The hijacked aircraft landed in Stockholm under
escort by Swedish jet fighters. The hijacker, appear
ing nervous, left the plane peacefully with police.
His name was withheld at his request.
Soviet authorities immediately sought extradition
of "the bandit."
Holmer said the man gave no specific reason for
coming to Sweden, but appeared to disapprove of
the Soviet regime.
The hijacker told police through an interpreter
that he was an engineer who had once before tried to
flee but failed and was punished, Holmer said. The
commissioner said he had no further details.
House eases auto exhaust standards
Washington — The House handed the auto indus
try a major victory yesterday by voting to delay some
auto-exhaust standards for two years and canceling
others.
On a 255 to 139 vote, the House approved an
industry-backed amendment easing the tough pollu
tion controls now schedule! to take effect later this
year on 1978-model cars.
The industry-backed proposal was also supported
by the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. The
labor unions feared that the tougher standards, re
quiring more costly pollution control equipment,
would have hurt car sales, leading to unemploy
ment.
The action represents a major delay for the auto
standards of the 1970 Clean Air Act. The law called
for a 90 per cent reduction in auto emissions of three
pollutants — hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides.
The standards were originally scheduled to take
effect in 1975 and have already been postponed three
times, to 1978-year models. But the industry con
tends it cannot possibly meet the standards this year
and may never be able to achieve some of them.
Moluccan terrorists release children
Assen, The Netherlands — Asian terrorists freed
all 105 children yesterday and early today from a
village elementary school they had occupied forfour
days, Justice Ministry spokesman Wim van Leeuwen
announced.
Van Leeuwen said more than 50 of the children,
aged between six and 12, were suffering from a

stomach infection apparently contracted in the over
crowded classroom where they were kept. He said
the terrorists still held six teachers, including school
principal Eeef van de Vliet.
Ten miles from the village school of Bovensmilde,
another group of terrorists still held a hijacked train
with 55 passengers. Yesterday, a young man was
thrust onto the tracks in the lush Dutch countryside
to stand for 20 minutes dressed as the symbol of
death, with a noose around his neck.
Six terrorists from the Dutch community of South
Moluccans had held the children and teachers in the
school since Monday when it and the train were
seized in simultaneous maneuvers to back their de
mands for an independent homeland.
The militants are from the 40,000-strong Dutch
community of South Moluccans, traditional war
riors who were an important element of the Dutch
colonial army. They want independence for the
Pacific island homeland, which once was a Dutch
colony and now is a part of Indonesia, and freedom
for countrymen imprisoned after similar attacks in
1975.
Prescriptions urged for cigarettes
Washington — Two former U.S. surgeons-general
and 10 organizations opposed to cigarette smoking
petitioned the federal government yesterday to regu
late cigarettes more strictly than saccharin and to
require doctors' prescriptions for cigarette sales.
The petition filed with the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) asked the agency to assert juris
diction over cigarettes on the ground that tobacco
contains drugs and therefore is under FDA's author
ity.
After the petition was filed, FDA spokesman
Wayne Pines said: "Tobacco is not within our juris
diction. This is supported by legislative history and
several court cases."
The anti-smoking petition said there is less risk of
getting cancer through the use of saccharin com
pared to the 300,000 premature deaths attributed
each year to smoking cigarettes.
The two former surgeons-general joining in the
petition were Drs. Luther Terry and Jesse Steinfeld.
Terry said it was completely inconsistent for the
federal government to warn about the hazards of
cigarette smoking while it also spends money to
support tobacco.
Carter vows to veto inflationary bills
Washington — The simmering budgetary conflict
between President Jimmy Carter and the
Democratic-controlled Congress escalated yesterday
when the president threatened to veto bills he con
siders too costly.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, Carter
stressed his concern with inflationand his belief that
it is tied directly to how well the government con
trols spending.
Even as Carter was appealing for restraint from
Congress, the House Appropriations Committee ap

proved a $61.3 billion appropriations bill for the
Departments of Labor and Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW). The measure provides $1.4 billion
more than Carter had requested for HEW.
At his news conference, Carter cited a farm bill and
funding for the water projects he had tried to elimi
nate as prime candidates for the first vetoes of his
presidency.
"I certainly reserve the right to veto bills if I think
they are excessive," he told a questioner. Congress
has not yet completed action on the two measures
Carter singled out, and the president said he "would
rather wait until I see the final form of those bills"
before saying flatly whether he would veto them.
Lockheed admits to foreign payoffs
Burbank — A financially shaky Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. utilized multimillion-dollar foreign payoffs
starting in 1970 in an effort to stay afloat, according
to a report issued yesterday by the company.
The report, compiled by a special investigating
committee, said top Lockheed management au
thorized between $30 million and $38 million in
questionable payments abroad to promote the sales
of its products. It said the payoffs were generally
concealed from the company's board of directors and
that employes who questioned the payments were
told to shut up or their careers would suffer.
"Lockheed's efforts to market aircraft and aviation
equipment and services abroad . . . have involved
the payment of substantial sums of money to third
parties, including individuals, corporations and
other entities believed to have political influence or
influence with potential customers," the report said.
Record U.S. trade deficit reported
Washington — The U.S. trade deficit in the first
four months of 1977 already has surpassed the total
for the worst trade year in history, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
In April, the United States bought 25 per cent more
goods abroad than it sold, for a trade deficit of $2.6
billion, the department said. That brought the
four-month total of $8.5 billion, well ahead of the
record $6.4 billion for all of 1972.
In the past, large trade deficits have tended to
depress the value of the U.S. dollar and contributed
to the nation's problems with inflation. But Carter
administration officials say the situation is different
now because of high oil prices.
Asst. Treasury Secretary C. Fred Bergsten said in
New York yesterday that the United States should try
to reduce its oil imports, but he said no other major
actions are needed to deal with the trade deficit.

escort by Swedish jet fighters. The hijacker, appear

His name was withheld at his request.
Soviet authorities immediately sought extradition
of "the bandit."
Holmer said the man gave no specific reason for
coming to Sweden, but appeared to disapprove of
the Soviet regime.
The hijacker told police through an interpreter
that he was an engineer who had once before tried to
flee but failed and was punished, Holmer said. The
commissioner said he had no further details.
House eases auto exhaust standards
Washington — The House handed the auto indus
try a major victory yesterday by voting to delay some
auto-exhaust standards for two years and canceling
others.
On a 255 to 139 vote, the House approved an
industry-backed amendment easing the tough pollu
tion controls now schedule! to take effect later this
year on 1978-model cars.
The industry-backed proposal was also supported
by the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. The
labor unions feared that the tougher standards, re
quiring more costly pollution control equipment,
would have hurt car sales, leading to unemploy
ment.
The action represents a major delay for the auto
standards of the 1970 Clean Air Act. The law called
for a 90 per cent reduction in auto emissions of three
pollutants — hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides.
The standards were originally scheduled to take
effect in 1975 and have already been postponed three
times, to 1978-year models. But the industry con
tends it cannot possibly meet the standards this year
and may never be able to achieve some of them.
Moluccan terrorists release children
Assen, The Netherlands — Asian terrorists freed
all 105 children yesterday and early today from a
village elementary school they had occupied forfour
days, Justice Ministry spokesman Wim van Leeuwen
announced.
Van Leeuwen said more than 50 of the children,
aged between six and 12, were suffering from a

stomach infection apparently contracted in the over
crowded classroom where they were kept. He said
the terrorists still held six teachers, including school
principal Eeef van de Vliet.
Ten miles from the village school of Bovensmilde,
another group of terrorists still held a hijacked train
with 55 passengers. Yesterday, a young man was
thrust onto the tracks in the lush Dutch countryside
to stand for 20 minutes dressed as the symbol of
death, with a noose around his neck.
Six terrorists from the Dutch community of South
Moluccans had held the children and teachers in the
school since Monday when it and the train were
seized in simultaneous maneuvers to back their de
mands for an independent homeland.
The militants are from the 40,000-strong Dutch
community of South Moluccans, traditional war
riors who were an important element of the Dutch
colonial army. They want independence for the
Pacific island homeland, which once was a Dutch
colony and now is a part of Indonesia, and freedom
for countrymen imprisoned after similar attacks in
1975.
Prescriptions urged for cigarettes
Washington — Two former U.S. surgeons-general
and 10 organizations opposed to cigarette smoking
petitioned the federal government yesterday to regu
late cigarettes more strictly than saccharin and to
require doctors' prescriptions for cigarette sales.
The petition filed with the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) asked the agency to assert juris
diction over cigarettes on the ground that tobacco
contains drugs and therefore is under FDA's author
ity.
After the petition was filed, FDA spokesman
Wayne Pines said: "Tobacco is not within our juris
diction. This is supported by legislative history and
several court cases."
The anti-smoking petition said there is less risk of
getting cancer through the use of saccharin com
pared to the 300,000 premature deaths attributed
each year to smoking cigarettes.
The two former surgeons-general joining in the
petition were Drs. Luther Terry and Jesse Steinfeld.
Terry said it was completely inconsistent for the
federal government to warn about the hazards of
cigarette smoking while it also spends money to
support tobacco.
Carter vows to veto inflationary bills
Washington — The simmering budgetary conflict
between President Jimmy Carter and the
Democratic-controlled Congress escalated yesterday
when the president threatened to veto bills he con
siders too costly.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, Carter
stressed his concern with inflationand his belief that
it is tied directly to how well the government con
trols spending.
Even as Carter was appealing for restraint from
Congress, the House Appropriations Committee ap

proved a $61.3 billion appropriations bill for the
Departments of Labor and Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW). The measure provides $1.4 billion
more than Carter had requested for HEW.
At his news conference, Carter cited a farm bill and
funding for the water projects he had tried to elimi
nate as prime candidates for the first vetoes of his
presidency.
"I certainly reserve the right to veto bills if I think
they are excessive," he told a questioner. Congress
has not yet completed action on the two measures
Carter singled out, and the president said he "would
rather wait until I see the final form of those bills"
before saying flatly whether he would veto them.
Lockheed admits to foreign payoffs
Burbank — A financially shaky Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. utilized multimillion-dollar foreign payoffs
starting in 1970 in an effort to stay afloat, according
to a report issued yesterday by the company.
The report, compiled by a special investigating
committee, said top Lockheed management au
thorized between $30 million and $38 million in
questionable payments abroad to promote the sales
of its products. It said the payoffs were generally
concealed from the company's board of directors and
that employes who questioned the payments were
told to shut up or their careers would suffer.
"Lockheed's efforts to market aircraft and aviation
equipment and services abroad . . . have involved
the payment of substantial sums of money to third
parties, including individuals, corporations and
other entities believed to have political influence or
influence with potential customers," the report said.
Record U.S. trade deficit reported
Washington — The U.S. trade deficit in the first
four months of 1977 already has surpassed the total
for the worst trade year in history, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
In April, the United States bought 25 per cent more
goods abroad than it sold, for a trade deficit of $2.6
billion, the department said. That brought the
four-month total of $8.5 billion, well ahead of the
record $6.4 billion for all of 1972.
In the past, large trade deficits have tended to
depress the value of the U.S. dollar and contributed
to the nation's problems with inflation. But Carter
administration officials say the situation is different
now because of high oil prices.
Asst. Treasury Secretary C. Fred Bergsten said in
New York yesterday that the United States should try
to reduce its oil imports, but he said no other major
actions are needed to deal with the trade deficit.

Soviet airliner hijacked to Sweden
Stockholm, Sweden — An unarmed hijacker
commandeered a Soviet airliner yesterday over Lat
via and forced it to Stockholm — bluffing his way
West, he told Swedish police, by convincing a
stewardess he had explosives beneath his jacket.
Once on Swedish soil, in police custody and with
no explosives, he said he wanted refuge.
Stockholm police commissioned Hans Holmer
identified the man as a 37-year-old citizen of
Byelorussia, in the western Soviet Union bordering
Poland. Holmer said he stated under police ques
tioning that he staged the hijack after making a trial
run on the plane the day before.

auto-exhaust standards for two years and canceling
others.
On a 255 to 139 vote, the House approved an
industry-backed amendment easing the tough pollu
tion controls now schedule! to take effect later this
year on 1978-model cars.
The industry-backed proposal was also supported
by the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. The
labor unions feared that the tougher standards, re
quiring more costly pollution control equipment,
would have hurt car sales, leading to unemploy
ment.
The action represents a major delay for the auto
standards of the 1970 Clean Air Act. The law called
for a 90 per cent reduction in auto emissions of three
pollutants — hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides.
The standards were originally scheduled to take
effect in 1975 and have already been postponed three
times, to 1978-year models. But the industry con
tends it cannot possibly meet the standards this year
and may never be able to achieve some of them.
Moluccan terrorists release children
Assen, The Netherlands — Asian terrorists freed
all 105 children yesterday and early today from a
village elementary school they had occupied forfour
days, Justice Ministry spokesman Wim van Leeuwen
announced.
Van Leeuwen said more than 50 of the children,
aged between six and 12, were suffering from a

stomach infection apparently contracted in the over
crowded classroom where they were kept. He said
the terrorists still held six teachers, including school
principal Eeef van de Vliet.
Ten miles from the village school of Bovensmilde,
another group of terrorists still held a hijacked train
with 55 passengers. Yesterday, a young man was
thrust onto the tracks in the lush Dutch countryside
to stand for 20 minutes dressed as the symbol of
death, with a noose around his neck.
Six terrorists from the Dutch community of South
Moluccans had held the children and teachers in the
school since Monday when it and the train were
seized in simultaneous maneuvers to back their de
mands for an independent homeland.
The militants are from the 40,000-strong Dutch
community of South Moluccans, traditional war
riors who were an important element of the Dutch
colonial army. They want independence for the
Pacific island homeland, which once was a Dutch
colony and now is a part of Indonesia, and freedom
for countrymen imprisoned after similar attacks in
1975.
Prescriptions urged for cigarettes
Washington — Two former U.S. surgeons-general
and 10 organizations opposed to cigarette smoking
petitioned the federal government yesterday to regu
late cigarettes more strictly than saccharin and to
require doctors' prescriptions for cigarette sales.
The petition filed with the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) asked the agency to assert juris
diction over cigarettes on the ground that tobacco
contains drugs and therefore is under FDA's author
ity.
After the petition was filed, FDA spokesman
Wayne Pines said: "Tobacco is not within our juris
diction. This is supported by legislative history and
several court cases."
The anti-smoking petition said there is less risk of
getting cancer through the use of saccharin com
pared to the 300,000 premature deaths attributed
each year to smoking cigarettes.
The two former surgeons-general joining in the
petition were Drs. Luther Terry and Jesse Steinfeld.
Terry said it was completely inconsistent for the
federal government to warn about the hazards of
cigarette smoking while it also spends money to
support tobacco.
Carter vows to veto inflationary bills
Washington — The simmering budgetary conflict
between President Jimmy Carter and the
Democratic-controlled Congress escalated yesterday
when the president threatened to veto bills he con
siders too costly.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, Carter
stressed his concern with inflationand his belief that
it is tied directly to how well the government con
trols spending.
Even as Carter was appealing for restraint from
Congress, the House Appropriations Committee ap

proved a $61.3 billion appropriations bill for the
Departments of Labor and Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW). The measure provides $1.4 billion
more than Carter had requested for HEW.
At his news conference, Carter cited a farm bill and
funding for the water projects he had tried to elimi
nate as prime candidates for the first vetoes of his
presidency.
"I certainly reserve the right to veto bills if I think
they are excessive," he told a questioner. Congress
has not yet completed action on the two measures
Carter singled out, and the president said he "would
rather wait until I see the final form of those bills"
before saying flatly whether he would veto them.
Lockheed admits to foreign payoffs
Burbank — A financially shaky Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. utilized multimillion-dollar foreign payoffs
starting in 1970 in an effort to stay afloat, according
to a report issued yesterday by the company.
The report, compiled by a special investigating
committee, said top Lockheed management au
thorized between $30 million and $38 million in
questionable payments abroad to promote the sales
of its products. It said the payoffs were generally
concealed from the company's board of directors and
that employes who questioned the payments were
told to shut up or their careers would suffer.
"Lockheed's efforts to market aircraft and aviation
equipment and services abroad . . . have involved
the payment of substantial sums of money to third
parties, including individuals, corporations and
other entities believed to have political influence or
influence with potential customers," the report said.
Record U.S. trade deficit reported
Washington — The U.S. trade deficit in the first
four months of 1977 already has surpassed the total
for the worst trade year in history, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
In April, the United States bought 25 per cent more
goods abroad than it sold, for a trade deficit of $2.6
billion, the department said. That brought the
four-month total of $8.5 billion, well ahead of the
record $6.4 billion for all of 1972.
In the past, large trade deficits have tended to
depress the value of the U.S. dollar and contributed
to the nation's problems with inflation. But Carter
administration officials say the situation is different
now because of high oil prices.
Asst. Treasury Secretary C. Fred Bergsten said in
New York yesterday that the United States should try
to reduce its oil imports, but he said no other major
actions are needed to deal with the trade deficit.

Soviet airliner hijacked to Sweden
Stockholm, Sweden — An unarmed hijacker
commandeered a Soviet airliner yesterday over Lat
via and forced it to Stockholm — bluffing his way
West, he told Swedish police, by convincing a
stewardess he had explosives beneath his jacket.
Once on Swedish soil, in police custody and with
no explosives, he said he wanted refuge.
Stockholm police commissioned Hans Holmer
identified the man as a 37-year-old citizen of
Byelorussia, in the western Soviet Union bordering
Poland. Holmer said he stated under police ques
tioning that he staged the hijack after making a trial
run on the plane the day before.
The hijacked aircraft landed in Stockholm under
escort by Swedish jet fighters. The hijacker, appear
ing nervous, left the plane peacefully with police.
His name was withheld at his request.
Soviet authorities immediately sought extradition
of "the bandit."
Holmer said the man gave no specific reason for
coming to Sweden, but appeared to disapprove of
the Soviet regime.
The hijacker told police through an interpreter
that he was an engineer who had once before tried to
flee but failed and was punished, Holmer said. The
commissioner said he had no further details.

for a 90 per cent reduction in auto emissions of three
pollutants — hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides.
The standards were originally scheduled to take
effect in 1975 and have already been postponed three
times, to 1978-year models. But the industry con
tends it cannot possibly meet the standards this year
and may never be able to achieve some of them.
Moluccan terrorists release children
Assen, The Netherlands — Asian terrorists freed
all 105 children yesterday and early today from a
village elementary school they had occupied forfour
days, Justice Ministry spokesman Wim van Leeuwen
announced.
Van Leeuwen said more than 50 of the children,
aged between six and 12, were suffering from a

stomach infection apparently contracted in the over
crowded classroom where they were kept. He said
the terrorists still held six teachers, including school
principal Eeef van de Vliet.
Ten miles from the village school of Bovensmilde,
another group of terrorists still held a hijacked train
with 55 passengers. Yesterday, a young man was
thrust onto the tracks in the lush Dutch countryside
to stand for 20 minutes dressed as the symbol of
death, with a noose around his neck.
Six terrorists from the Dutch community of South
Moluccans had held the children and teachers in the
school since Monday when it and the train were
seized in simultaneous maneuvers to back their de
mands for an independent homeland.
The militants are from the 40,000-strong Dutch
community of South Moluccans, traditional war
riors who were an important element of the Dutch
colonial army. They want independence for the
Pacific island homeland, which once was a Dutch
colony and now is a part of Indonesia, and freedom
for countrymen imprisoned after similar attacks in
1975.
Prescriptions urged for cigarettes
Washington — Two former U.S. surgeons-general
and 10 organizations opposed to cigarette smoking
petitioned the federal government yesterday to regu
late cigarettes more strictly than saccharin and to
require doctors' prescriptions for cigarette sales.
The petition filed with the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) asked the agency to assert juris
diction over cigarettes on the ground that tobacco
contains drugs and therefore is under FDA's author
ity.
After the petition was filed, FDA spokesman
Wayne Pines said: "Tobacco is not within our juris
diction. This is supported by legislative history and
several court cases."
The anti-smoking petition said there is less risk of
getting cancer through the use of saccharin com
pared to the 300,000 premature deaths attributed
each year to smoking cigarettes.
The two former surgeons-general joining in the
petition were Drs. Luther Terry and Jesse Steinfeld.
Terry said it was completely inconsistent for the
federal government to warn about the hazards of
cigarette smoking while it also spends money to
support tobacco.
Carter vows to veto inflationary bills
Washington — The simmering budgetary conflict
between President Jimmy Carter and the
Democratic-controlled Congress escalated yesterday
when the president threatened to veto bills he con
siders too costly.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, Carter
stressed his concern with inflationand his belief that
it is tied directly to how well the government con
trols spending.
Even as Carter was appealing for restraint from
Congress, the House Appropriations Committee ap

proved a $61.3 billion appropriations bill for the
Departments of Labor and Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW). The measure provides $1.4 billion
more than Carter had requested for HEW.
At his news conference, Carter cited a farm bill and
funding for the water projects he had tried to elimi
nate as prime candidates for the first vetoes of his
presidency.
"I certainly reserve the right to veto bills if I think
they are excessive," he told a questioner. Congress
has not yet completed action on the two measures
Carter singled out, and the president said he "would
rather wait until I see the final form of those bills"
before saying flatly whether he would veto them.
Lockheed admits to foreign payoffs
Burbank — A financially shaky Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. utilized multimillion-dollar foreign payoffs
starting in 1970 in an effort to stay afloat, according
to a report issued yesterday by the company.
The report, compiled by a special investigating
committee, said top Lockheed management au
thorized between $30 million and $38 million in
questionable payments abroad to promote the sales
of its products. It said the payoffs were generally
concealed from the company's board of directors and
that employes who questioned the payments were
told to shut up or their careers would suffer.
"Lockheed's efforts to market aircraft and aviation
equipment and services abroad . . . have involved
the payment of substantial sums of money to third
parties, including individuals, corporations and
other entities believed to have political influence or
influence with potential customers," the report said.
Record U.S. trade deficit reported
Washington — The U.S. trade deficit in the first
four months of 1977 already has surpassed the total
for the worst trade year in history, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
In April, the United States bought 25 per cent more
goods abroad than it sold, for a trade deficit of $2.6
billion, the department said. That brought the
four-month total of $8.5 billion, well ahead of the
record $6.4 billion for all of 1972.
In the past, large trade deficits have tended to
depress the value of the U.S. dollar and contributed
to the nation's problems with inflation. But Carter
administration officials say the situation is different
now because of high oil prices.
Asst. Treasury Secretary C. Fred Bergsten said in
New York yesterday that the United States should try
to reduce its oil imports, but he said no other major
actions are needed to deal with the trade deficit.
