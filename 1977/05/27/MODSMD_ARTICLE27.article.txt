# Chilean deplores junta's repression
## 
### Martin Kemberg 
Human rights and academic free
doms are being violated at the univer
sities of Chile, a former educational
leader in the Popular Unity govern
ment of Salvador Allende charged in a
speech at Bolivar House Wednesday
evening.
Enrique Kirberg, president of the
State Technical University of Chile
from 1968 to 1973 and presently a
senior research associate at the Latin
America Institute of Columbia Univer
sity, spoke to a group of 35 people at
Bolivar.
The military junta closed down
programs in the humanities and social
sciences, replaced eight university
presidents with retired military offic
ers, fired 30 per cent of the faculty and
expelled thousands of students, he
said.
Kirberg said no expelled faculty
members or students "will be able to
continue their studies in Chile. Many
students were jailed and many lost
their lives. The military have per
meated every level of the educational
system.
'Minds of youth'
"The junta wants to dominate the
minds of youth through the militariza
tion of the elementary schools and the
high schools," he continued. "Sol
diers patrol university grounds and
books are burned according to military
instructions."
Describing the rapid and violent
changes at the Technical University
during and after the military coup on
Sept. 11, 1973, Kirberg said, "It was
surrounded by units of the armed
forces and bombarded with heavy ar
tillery; many died, many were
wounded, and over 700 people were
arrested.
"Afterwards many were executed

including the singer, Victor Jara, a
University staff member."
Jara was considered to be Chile's
Pete Seeger.
"I myself was put up against the wall
to be shot. But they changed their
minds, and after ill-treating me I was
imprisoned and later taken to Dawson
Island.
Two years in prison
"I was held in concentration camps
and prisons for over two years," Kir
berg said. An offer of a professorship
from Columbia and protests from sci
entific and university circles secured
his release.
kirberg addressed himself to what
he termed "the most serious crime that
is now occurring in Chile: abduction.
The desaparecidos, the disappeared
persons."
He noted that "despite continual
protests and several independent in
vestigations, the Chilean government
has...not made any serious attempt to
offer an explanation of the disappear
ance of over 2500 people.
"In recent months, many bodies
have turned up in different parts of the
country: in rivers, beaches and
ravines. The bodies have shown signs
of mutilation, especially of the fingers
and hands, and all appear to have been
bound with wire." he said.

He noted that "despite continual
protests and several independent in
vestigations, the Chilean government
has...not made any serious attempt to
offer an explanation of the disappear
ance of over 2500 people.
"In recent months, many bodies
have turned up in different parts of the
country: in rivers, beaches and
ravines. The bodies have shown signs
of mutilation, especially of the fingers
and hands, and all appear to have been
bound with wire." he said.
Human rights and academic free
doms are being violated at the univer
sities of Chile, a former educational
leader in the Popular Unity govern
ment of Salvador Allende charged in a
speech at Bolivar House Wednesday
evening.
Enrique Kirberg, president of the
State Technical University of Chile
from 1968 to 1973 and presently a
senior research associate at the Latin
America Institute of Columbia Univer
sity, spoke to a group of 35 people at
Bolivar.
The military junta closed down
programs in the humanities and social
sciences, replaced eight university
presidents with retired military offic
ers, fired 30 per cent of the faculty and
expelled thousands of students, he
said.
Kirberg said no expelled faculty
members or students "will be able to
continue their studies in Chile. Many
students were jailed and many lost
their lives. The military have per
meated every level of the educational
system.
'Minds of youth'
"The junta wants to dominate the
minds of youth through the militariza
tion of the elementary schools and the
high schools," he continued. "Sol
diers patrol university grounds and
books are burned according to military
instructions."
Describing the rapid and violent
changes at the Technical University
during and after the military coup on
Sept. 11, 1973, Kirberg said, "It was
surrounded by units of the armed
forces and bombarded with heavy ar
tillery; many died, many were
wounded, and over 700 people were
arrested.
"Afterwards many were executed

including the singer, Victor Jara, a
University staff member."
Jara was considered to be Chile's
Pete Seeger.
"I myself was put up against the wall
to be shot. But they changed their
minds, and after ill-treating me I was
imprisoned and later taken to Dawson
Island.
Two years in prison
"I was held in concentration camps
and prisons for over two years," Kir
berg said. An offer of a professorship
from Columbia and protests from sci
entific and university circles secured
his release.
kirberg addressed himself to what
he termed "the most serious crime that
is now occurring in Chile: abduction.
The desaparecidos, the disappeared
persons."
He noted that "despite continual
protests and several independent in
vestigations, the Chilean government
has...not made any serious attempt to
offer an explanation of the disappear
ance of over 2500 people.
"In recent months, many bodies
have turned up in different parts of the

ravines. The bodies have shown signs
of mutilation, especially of the fingers
and hands, and all appear to have been
