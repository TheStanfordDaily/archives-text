# For Spanish-Americans
## More hospital interpreters urged 
### Bill Burger 
A shortage of interpreters for
Spanish-speaking patients and
employes plagues Stanford Hospital,
according to workers and students
there.
Olga Guerra, the only recognized in
terpreter, said she believes there is a
clear need for the hospital to train and
authorize additional interpreters so
the hospital will eventually have 24-
hour interpreting service in all critical
departments dealing with patients.
Many Spanish-speaking workers in
the hospital are now asked to do inter
preting when Guerra is off duty. Ac
cording to Guerra, many of these
workers complain they have to trans
late in these instances.
In addition, several workers have
been disciplined by their supervisors
for leaving their jobs to do interpreting
work that is asked of them.
Guerra says she has asked Paul Hof
mann, director of the Stanford Hospi
tal and clinics, for additional inter
preters to cover all shifts but that "the
administration feels the problem is co
vered."
Hofmann said, "I think it's a prob
lem we must be very sensitive to, and 1
think we are."
According to Hofmann, the hospital

"has taken steps on our own initiative
to translate forms for workers so they
can understand them whether or not
there is an interpreter present."
Loretta Ortiz y Pino, a first year med
ical student here, said medical stu
dents are sometimes asked to interpret
for patients who come in when Guerra
is not available. This is a considerable
imposition on the students, Ortiz y
Pino said, and they often feel uncom
fortable when asked to do it.
A group of chicano medical students
met with Hofmann on Wednesday to
discuss the problem and Hofmann de
scribed the meeting as very helpful.
Hofmann said he expects to present
the students with a written response to
the problem in about two weeks after
which he plans to meet with them
again. Administrators plan to do more
in this area, he said.
Nancy Fuller, a licensed vocational
nurse (LVN) and phlebotomist (blood
technician) at the hospital, claims that
many LVNs interpret frequently but do
not get paid for the job. "They also
catch hell when they do it (interpret)
and leave their job," added Puller.
Maria Garcia, a Gentral SERVIGES
employe, claims she falls behind on
her work when asked to interpret for
patients entering the hospital. "I some

times lose an hour's work," said Gar
cia, "but I can't refuse to do it."
Because workers who are unfamiliar
with medical terminology are some
times asked to interpret, patients are
often not informed as to what is hap
pening, said Guerra.
Guerra said many workers who do
not speak either English or Spanish
well can easily mix up the terminol
ogy-
Guerra also said it would be more
psychologically beneficial for patients
if their interpreters were not merely
workers available to do the job at the
time.
"Patients deserve better than having
a maid tell them their baby died," said
Guerra.
Guerra said she has noticed an im
provement in the hospital's attitude
toward Spanish-speaking workers.
"Nurses and doctors are more sensi
tive now," said Guerra, "and some
positive changes are taking place."
Guerra said there are more Spanish
speaking workers "all around" the
hospital now, and she said she be
lieves the administration now
"realizes the need for bilingual ser
vices" for workers and patients.
Fuller agreed that translators should
be on every shift and in "key areas"
around the hospital, but adds that the
job should be outlined in the job de
scription and should have a pay scale
of its own.
Director of Personnel Ron Twomey
said, "It's a very important problem
and something we're trying to respond
to." Twomey noted that most
employes in the hospital are bilingual
but complex medical terminology
often requires professionals for inter
preting to be done adequately.
Twomey said he feels the problem
can best be solved by having more pro
fessional people in the hospital who
are bilingual. This solution will pre
vent the loss of important medical de
tails to translation, he explained.
"We would like to have bilingual
people in all departments who could
cover everything," said Twomey, "but
this would still not cover the hospital's
interpreting needs as well as a large

nurse (LVN) and phlebotomist (blood
technician) at the hospital, claims that
many LVNs interpret frequently but do
not get paid for the job. "They also
catch hell when they do it (interpret)
and leave their job," added Puller.
Maria Garcia, a Gentral SERVIGES
employe, claims she falls behind on
her work when asked to interpret for
patients entering the hospital. "I some

times lose an hour's work," said Gar
cia, "but I can't refuse to do it."
Because workers who are unfamiliar
with medical terminology are some
times asked to interpret, patients are
often not informed as to what is hap
pening, said Guerra.
Guerra said many workers who do
not speak either English or Spanish
well can easily mix up the terminol
ogy-
Guerra also said it would be more
psychologically beneficial for patients
if their interpreters were not merely
workers available to do the job at the
time.
"Patients deserve better than having
a maid tell them their baby died," said
Guerra.
Guerra said she has noticed an im
provement in the hospital's attitude
toward Spanish-speaking workers.
"Nurses and doctors are more sensi
tive now," said Guerra, "and some
positive changes are taking place."
Guerra said there are more Spanish
speaking workers "all around" the
hospital now, and she said she be
lieves the administration now
"realizes the need for bilingual ser
vices" for workers and patients.
Fuller agreed that translators should
be on every shift and in "key areas"
around the hospital, but adds that the
job should be outlined in the job de
scription and should have a pay scale
of its own.
Director of Personnel Ron Twomey
said, "It's a very important problem
and something we're trying to respond
to." Twomey noted that most
employes in the hospital are bilingual
but complex medical terminology
often requires professionals for inter
preting to be done adequately.
Twomey said he feels the problem
can best be solved by having more pro
fessional people in the hospital who
are bilingual. This solution will pre
vent the loss of important medical de
tails to translation, he explained.
"We would like to have bilingual
people in all departments who could
cover everything," said Twomey, "but
this would still not cover the hospital's
interpreting needs as well as a large
number of bilingual professionals."
A shortage of interpreters for
Spanish-speaking patients and
employes plagues Stanford Hospital,
according to workers and students
there.
Olga Guerra, the only recognized in
terpreter, said she believes there is a
clear need for the hospital to train and
authorize additional interpreters so
the hospital will eventually have 24-
hour interpreting service in all critical
departments dealing with patients.
Many Spanish-speaking workers in
the hospital are now asked to do inter
preting when Guerra is off duty. Ac
cording to Guerra, many of these
workers complain they have to trans
late in these instances.
In addition, several workers have
been disciplined by their supervisors
for leaving their jobs to do interpreting
work that is asked of them.
Guerra says she has asked Paul Hof
mann, director of the Stanford Hospi
tal and clinics, for additional inter
preters to cover all shifts but that "the
administration feels the problem is co
vered."
Hofmann said, "I think it's a prob
lem we must be very sensitive to, and 1
think we are."
According to Hofmann, the hospital

"has taken steps on our own initiative
to translate forms for workers so they
can understand them whether or not
there is an interpreter present."
Loretta Ortiz y Pino, a first year med
ical student here, said medical stu
dents are sometimes asked to interpret
for patients who come in when Guerra
is not available. This is a considerable
imposition on the students, Ortiz y
Pino said, and they often feel uncom
fortable when asked to do it.
A group of chicano medical students
met with Hofmann on Wednesday to
discuss the problem and Hofmann de
scribed the meeting as very helpful.
Hofmann said he expects to present
the students with a written response to
the problem in about two weeks after
which he plans to meet with them
again. Administrators plan to do more
in this area, he said.
