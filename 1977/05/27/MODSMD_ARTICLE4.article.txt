## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Arrests of at least 250 students pro
testing UC activities including in
vestments in South Africa continued
through early this morning at a sit-in at
UC-Santa Cruz.
Police began arresting the de
monstrators at 10:15 p.m. yesterday
after several hours of unsuccessful
negotiations between University offi
cials and representatives of the Coali
tion Against Institutional Racism
(CAIR), who organized the demonstra

tion. The protesters were taken to the
Santa Cruz Court House and released
on their own recognizance.
Students occupied the Santa Cruz
administrative offices in the Central
Services building at noon yesterday,
with a list of demands for the chancel
lor concerning UC investments in
South Africa, the Bakke decision, the
recent revision ot UC admissions pol
icy and the status of third world
academic programs at Santa Cruz, ac
cording to Kent Dannehl of City on a
Hill, the campus newspaper.
The sit-in and preceding rally at
Santa Cruz were part of a series of de
monstrations at UC campuses in
Northern California, including UC-
BerkeFey and UC-Davis.
Twenty persons were arrested at
Davis four hours before the police
moved in at Santa Cruz. The Davis stu
dents had occupied the office of Davis
Chancellor James Meyer with a list of
demands similar to those at Santa
Cruz, according to Rick Dower of the
Davis Aggie.
Berkeley's Wheeler Hall was oc
cupied for two hours by 150 students
after several hundred attended a rally
in the rain in Sproul Plaza, followed by
a march through downtown Berkeley
on Shattuck Avenue, according to
Steve Diamond of the Daily Califor
nian.
The demonstrators left Wheeler after
formulating a series of demands which
included calling for IJC to create an
investment advisory board and to
withdraw IJC investments from South
Africa, Diamond said.
The students also called for a gen
eral strike at Berkeley on June 3, he
said.
There were no arrests.
The chancellors of al 1 three UC cam
puses called in sick yesterday, accord
ing to Dower.
The coordinated protests were made
following a call on May 19 by Cam
puses United Against Apartheid
(CUAA) for coordinated actions
statewide today to protest campus in

vestments in South Africa.
When asked why no activities took
place at Stanford yesterday, Stanford
Committee for a Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP) member Chris
Coleman said a committee had been
formed to plan various actions but
since "energy is going down some
what at the end of the quarter" nothing
materialized.
CAIR requested a moratorium on
classes at Santa Cruz yesterday. Most
professors did not hold classes in
honor of that request, Dannehl said.
Leaflets
The Santa Cruz demonstrators were
leafleting at the front gates of the cam
pus at 6:30 a.m. The demonstrators
then marched to Central Services and
occupied administrative offices on the
second floor. A rally and teach-in held
concurrently outside attracted over
1000 people, according to Dannehl.
The crowd outside waited as negoti
ations between Vice Chancellor
Eugene Cota-Robles and CAIR rep
resentatives continued throughout the
afternoon and evening.
The administration's preliminary
response to the demands at 4 p.m. was
termed "inadequate" by the protesters.
Three hundred were still outside at
10 p.m. when those inside decided to
remain and be arrested despite various
concessions to some of their demands.
Each protester will be charged with
one count of trespassing, said Julie
Kosterlitz, editor of City on a Hill.
The inability of the Santa Cruz ad
ministration to meet the de
monstrators' demand for divestiture of
UC stocks in South Africa was a prim
ary reason behind the decision to stay,
according to Chris Crey, a SCRIP
member.
Crey read an expression of solidarity
at the demonstration at H:3O last night.
"I think this will make an effect, and
will bring the problem to the attention
of a lot of people." Vice Chancellor
Cota-Robles told City on a Hill reporter
Dave Landis during the course of the
negotiations.
