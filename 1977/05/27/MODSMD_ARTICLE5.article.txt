# Area firms asked to convert to nonmilitary products
## 
### Bill Wien 
"Look, here we are amidst the military
industrial complex in Santa Clara
county—what are we going to do about it?"
This is the question, says Natalie Shiras,
asked by a group of people restless with the
lack of energy in the peace movement fol
lowing the Vietnam war. They channeled
their energy into forming the Mid-
Peninsula Conversion Project (MPCP).
With an initial grant of $800 from the
Agape Foundation of California (a small
foundation which gives seed money to pro
jects for nonviolent social change), the pro
ject was born in 1975.
Shiras, who is codirector of the MPCP.
defines conversion as "changing what gets
produced in the work place," but concedes
that the MPCP has not been able to convert a
plant "per se."
"But peoplearebeginningtothink in new
ways," she says. "We brought together a
group of engineers, machinists and mana
gers who worked at military companies,
and they decided to start a community bus
iness of their own building solar panels.

Solpower Industries now has a number of
contracts and it wouldn't have happened
unless we brought this group together."
Go to churches
Shiras and others at the MPCP go to
churches, civic centers and political or
ganizations like the Palo Alto Democratic
Club to raise the issue of military spending.
They also publish quarterly the Plowshare
Press tabloid and distribute it to shopping
centers, military plant gates and other loca
tions.
Alan Bernstein, a political science
graduate henf in 1976 and an early initiator
of the MPCP, says, "Essentially what we are
trying to do is make public the high reliance
on military contracts in the area.
"Santa Clara receives more military con
tracting per capita than any county in the
nation, that is, up to 3 billion per year. There
are approximately 150 corporations in the
area that receive $100,000 or more in direct
military contracts." he said.
Bernstein added there are "hundreds of
smaller electronics industries indirectly
connected with military contracting that

build electronic semiconductor parts and
components that go into the missiles, bom
bers and anti-personnel weapons systems,"
he says.
Military contracts
Bernstein said firms with military con
tracts go through a "boom and bust cycle of
jobs" and noted that from year to year a
number of companies have to lay off
employes depending upon whether thefirm
pets a contract or not.
He contended that more jobs could be
created in the civilian sector if more social
and fewer military goods were produced.
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) intro
duced the "Defense Economic Adjustment
Act" before Congress last year. The hill
would have required defense contractors to
put 0.5 per cent of their defense sales into a
trust fund for conversion of their facilities if
they lose their contracts, but the measure
died at the last session of Congress and was
not reintroduced.
A bill has been introduced by Rep. John
Bingham (D-N.Y.) entitled the "Conversion
Adjustment Assistance Act." A securitybill

for defense workers, it would allow read
justment allowances of up to 90 per cent for
salary, benefits sharing and relocation for
workers affected by cuts in military spend
ing.
Chaired by Gus
The bill is now under the Employment
Opportunities Subcommittee of the House
Committee on Education and Labor chaired
by Rep. Gus Hawkins (D-Calif.).
Any kind of conversion legislation.
Bernstein pointed out. would have to be
passed with a guarantee of hill employment
and job retraining.
"We don't talk about putting people out
of work. People are scared of losing their
jobs—it's the first question they ask us," he
said.
According to Shiras, many companies in
the area are technically capable of convert
ing. "We've looked at a number of com
panies and found it possible for them to
convert using the same machinery and ex
pertise of their engineers and technicians,"
she states.

She also said the Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI) "does naval warfare research to
the tune of 25 million a year and it could be
putting much more research and develop
ment into alternate forms of energy."
SRI became independent of the Univer
sity in 1970.
The Pacific Studies Center (PSC), another
social change group, maintains a library
and information files on topics ranging
from counterinsurgency in Thailand to
health hazards in the Santa Clara Valley
electronics industry.
Larry Siegel, coordinator of the PSC,
commented on his concern with the South
African issue and the Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP).
"We have a great deal of background in
researching Stanford and its role in the
world, and the PSC is now publishing in
conjunction with Stanford students in
volved in SCRIP a pamphlet on Stanford
and its trustees involved with South Af
rica."

"Look, here we are amidst the military
industrial complex in Santa Clara
county—what are we going to do about it?"
This is the question, says Natalie Shiras,
asked by a group of people restless with the
lack of energy in the peace movement fol
lowing the Vietnam war. They channeled
their energy into forming the Mid-
Peninsula Conversion Project (MPCP).
With an initial grant of $800 from the
Agape Foundation of California (a small
foundation which gives seed money to pro
jects for nonviolent social change), the pro
ject was born in 1975.
Shiras, who is codirector of the MPCP.
defines conversion as "changing what gets
produced in the work place," but concedes
that the MPCP has not been able to convert a
plant "per se."
"But peoplearebeginningtothink in new
ways," she says. "We brought together a
group of engineers, machinists and mana
gers who worked at military companies,
and they decided to start a community bus
iness of their own building solar panels.

Solpower Industries now has a number of
contracts and it wouldn't have happened
unless we brought this group together."
Go to churches
Shiras and others at the MPCP go to
churches, civic centers and political or
ganizations like the Palo Alto Democratic
Club to raise the issue of military spending.
They also publish quarterly the Plowshare
Press tabloid and distribute it to shopping
centers, military plant gates and other loca
tions.
Alan Bernstein, a political science
graduate henf in 1976 and an early initiator
of the MPCP, says, "Essentially what we are
trying to do is make public the high reliance
on military contracts in the area.
"Santa Clara receives more military con
tracting per capita than any county in the
nation, that is, up to 3 billion per year. There
are approximately 150 corporations in the
area that receive $100,000 or more in direct
military contracts." he said.
Bernstein added there are "hundreds of
smaller electronics industries indirectly
connected with military contracting that

build electronic semiconductor parts and
components that go into the missiles, bom
bers and anti-personnel weapons systems,"
he says.
Military contracts
Bernstein said firms with military con
tracts go through a "boom and bust cycle of
jobs" and noted that from year to year a
number of companies have to lay off
employes depending upon whether thefirm
pets a contract or not.
He contended that more jobs could be
created in the civilian sector if more social
and fewer military goods were produced.
