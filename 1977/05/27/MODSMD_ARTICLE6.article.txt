# Religion & the sit-in
## 
### 
"The people, united, will
never be defeated!" Hundreds of
students chanted and clapped in
the sweaty heat of the Old Un
ion. The police had been arrest
ing people for the past four
hours, so people could now walk
around, stretch out or sleep.
Some even danced and sang.
Aaron spotted John across the
room and walked over to him. "I
never thought I'd see you here
tonight. What will your parents
say to all their farmer friends
when they see your mug on T.V.
back in North Dakota? They'll
think their little Johnny has re
nounced the pure ways of the
Midwest for the decadent hippie
life of California," Aaron said.
"That's not all. I've given up
my weekly Bible study to be
here," quipped John.
"My God, what warped
priorities," mocked Aaron. They
both laughed.
"Hey, how about this rally? I
was beginning to think I'd never
see a big protest before I
graduated," Aaron said, wiping
the long hair from his face and
adjusting his glasses.
"I remember when I was in
high school," he continued,
"how my brother would tell me
about the sit-ins he organized at
Columbia. They had a really big
one after the Cambodian inva
sion in '70. All the students
turned out and clogged the ad
ministration building for ihree
straight days. Cops shot tear gas
and busted heads. It was great.
I'd heard great things about
Stanford during the war years,
but after I got here, I thought it
was all a thing of the past."
Aaron leaned against the wall
and surveyed the Old Union,
savoring the sit-in.
"But what gets me most," said
Aaron, "is how all you straight
guys are here tonight. I thought
only the Earth Shoe-types would
be here. Tell me, what made you
come?"
John unfolded his crossed
legs. "South Africa's apartheid
system is horrible," he said. "I
think this sit-in and the arrests
will draw attention to their sin
ful system."
Aaron sat down on the floor.
"I'm glad guys like you are here.
It shows solidarity on this cam
pus for the sit-in, even if your
motives are a bit different from
mine. I would call apartheid
evil, not sinful. Sin is a religious
concept and I don't believe in
God or any religion. Even if I did,
who am I to judge whether
someone's religion is right or
wrong. Different strokes for dif
ferent folks, you know."
"Aaron, if that were true, we
couldn't judge the South Afri
cans, because their racial beliefs
come from their religion."

"Well, that's different," Aaron
said, pulling a cigarette from his
army fatigue jacket. "1 can't
judge another person's religious
beliefs unless he oppresses or
hurts others.
Aaron stuck the cigarette into
his mouth and flicked his lighter
to light it. He took a deep drag
and exhaled. "Hey, sod sprout,
how about some produce from
the earth? This is legal weed,
you know."
"No thanks, comrade, We
chew that stuff. The only thing

we smoke is corn silk." They
both laughed.
"I think you have a problem in
your thinking," John said. "You
say there is no way to judge any
one else unless they hurt others.
That's your yardstick. You also
say people can chose any religi
ous belief they want because,
how do we know what's right.
Well then, how do we know
'don't hurt others' is the right
yardstick or the only yardstick?
Besides, if we are all going to die,
and that's it, period, what differ
ence does it make if we help the
blacks in South Africa or not? If
it doesn't matter what we do,
why not just have a good time
while we can?"
Aaron rose onto his haunches.
"Well, protesting against
apartheid is my thing.
"So apartheid is: t necessarily
good or bad. You call it bad be
cause that's your trip?"
Aaron looked up in surprise.
"Now wait, I'm not saying that at
all. Apartheid is wrong and evil.
Don't you think that?"
John laughed softly. "Don't
get me wrong. I agree with the
protest. All I'm say
ing is that in your philosophical
setup, it doesn't make any differ
ence whether a person con
demns or applauds apartheid,
just as long as he 'does his thing'
because 'who are we to judge?'
You don't have any reason to say
man is significant enough or im
portant enough to be freed from
oppression."
"And you do?"
"Why, yes, I do," John said,
crossing his legs again. "The
Bible says all men are created in
the image of God. Therefore,
they are important and signific
ant, worthy of being treated well.
Also, the Bible saysâ€”"
"Hold it, hold it," Aaron said,

waving his hand. "Don't give me
some Bible jazz. This is 1977, not
the Middle Ages."
"I agree. And the Bible has lost
none of its relevance. Let's take
the concept of sin for example.
The Bible says man has rebelled
against God and has corrupted
himself. Now, certainly, that
seems self-evident. A lot of
people have been trying for a
long time to improve things, and
they haven't been too successful.
We've made some technological
advances, for sure, but now we
kill each other with Ml 6's and
MIRV warheads instead of
spears and arrows. Some ad
vancements, huh?"
Aaron shook his head. "That's
too simplistic. Besides, if what
you say is true, what gives you
any hope at all?"
Just then, a girl walked over
and offered them a sack of food.
"Some of the sisters brought this
over," she said.
Aaron and John rummaged
through the sack of organic de
lights.
"Let me answer your ques
tion," John said, stuffing his
mouth with granola. "That's
why Christ came and died. Our
rebellion through sin separates
us from God. Christ's death is the
only thing that can end that sep
aration.
"Let me put it this way. We are
going to get arrested and hauled
before a magistrate. Suppose
he's your father. Say he fines us
for trespassing and failure to
disperse, etc. OK, now we have
to pay the fine because we're
guilty. Then suppose your dad
gives you the money to pay the
fine."
"That's great, except my dad's
a plumber in New York City."
"But don't you see that God is
everyone's father. So, in a sense,
Christ is 'giving us money to pay
the fine of sin,' if we will accept
it from him."
Aaron was unconvinced,
"Maybe that's all right for you,
but I can't accept it. Even if I did
agree with you, 1 couldn't give
up my freedom to someone else
like that."
"Well, I think we're about to
give up our freedom to someone
right now," John said.
Just then, a burly cop tapped
both of them on the shoulders.
"OK boys, you're under arrest.
Come with me."
They scampered to their feet
and were led off to the proces
sing room, where they were
fingerprinted, photographed
and handcuffed. As they walked
out of the back door of the Old
Union, they heard the shouts
and chants from the candle-lit
vigil outside.
