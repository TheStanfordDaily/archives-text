## Opinions On choosing medical students 
### 
David Wu

While the Daily had to publish
Dave Sartoris' column (Daily,
April 20), twice to get a rise from
the "conservative" medical
community, Dr. Robert Segal's
piece of pompous bombastry on
socialized medicine (Daily,
April 26) is going to catch some
flack on the first pass.
Segal, in replying to Sartoris'
suggestion that patients be given
a role in the selection of medical
school candidates, compared lay
people's competence to do so
with the competence of veterina
rian's clients to select candidates
for vet school.
There is a difference between
the two groups, you know. And I
take exception to his obfuscation
of that difference. His denigrat
ing comparisou might have been
excused as a rare slip of the pro
fessional ego had he not im
mediately proceeded to stick
both feet in his mouth by stating,
"Don't get me wrong â€” doctors
are themselves patients from
time to time. . . but medicine is a
science as well as an art, and one

must be judged by his peers."
I have never run across such a
succinct statement of all 1 find
abhorrent in the medical profes
sion.
We of the teeming masses
would like to believe that our
society, being a liberal democ
racy, is founded upon the as
sumption that informed lay
people can make intelligent de
cisions concerning their fellow
citizens. Violations of this ethnic
often smack of cronyism, and
should this be flagrant and per
sistant, severe and distasteful
political repercussions follow.
Doctors judge doctors
The attitude that only doctors
are competent to judge doctors,
or even medical school aspir
ants, typifies a professional
community which is danger
ously close to having its ears and
tail clipped by the government
for, in part, its unresponsiveness
to non-medical sources of opin
ion.
It seems that at the present
time, the whole process of be

coming a doctor is off kilter: the
incentives and hurdles appear to
be misplaced.
Not only is there a very real
emphasis on the collection of
grades, test scores and easily
catalogueable extracurricular
activities in the medical school
admissions process, but this
emphasis casts an even larger
shadow in that its intimdating
effect discourages many poten
tial applicants.
Before people even apply to
medical school, there is a self
selection process which elimi
nates many people because they
perceive themselves to be lack
ing in grades and test scores or
because they became disgusted
by a process which professes to
select people for a human pro
fession yet has all the attributes
of an intellectual beauty contest.
From the pre-selected group
which is left, future medical stu
dents are chosen using criteria
which place great importance on
grades and test scores.
Change is needed in this pro
cess. Perhaps the solicitation of
more lay people's opinion in the
medical school selection process
or,' in a deeper departure from
present procedure, even letting
lay people decide who will go to
medical school would help re
store the parity of emphasis bet
ween medicine as an art and
medicine as a science.
Deemphasize GPA
Certainly the deemphasis of
"objective" criteria, i.e. GPA and
MCATS and a concomitant em
phasis on peer evaluation and
record of social service, would
drastically alter the type of doc
tor we get out of medical school.
Whether this alteration will be
for better or worse will depend
on a myriad of other factors and
among them will be the motiva
tion of the people who enter
medicine. Although the reduc
tion of doctor's remuneration
would have little effect on the
cost of any plan for the reorgani
zation of medicine, there is one
area on which it could have a
drastic effect: why people
choose medicine as a career.
A most fascinating
phenomena is occurring: those
who are not going into medicine
insist those who are are primar
ily motivated by financial
reasons, while all the future
young Dr. Kildares' insist money
isn't a factor at all.
Without taking sides, I prop
ose we eliminate the possibility
that avarice is a motivating fac
tor by reducing the average doc
tor's income to the level of the
average college professor's in
come.
What enticement
Ah, but you would ask, what
would medicine offer to allure
our finest talent if excessive in
come and the more outrageous
forms of independence were ph
ased out? The same things it of
fers now: service to people, the
opportunity to be needed
wherever one is, the choice of a
wide range of medically related
careers, the chance to be exemp
lar of education for the good of
the community.
Perhaps the doctors so pro
duced would obviate the prob
lem mentioned of salaried doc
tors having less incentive for
compassion. As the priesthood
so aptly illustrates, obedience

does not imply callousness, and
compassion should not be for
sale at any price.
As I see it, the problem with
the salaried physicians of today,
if any exists, is that there is the
opportunity of high pay coupled
with regular eight hour days.
The problem isn't so much the
salary system, but that the incen
tives attract the wrong kind of
people whom the selection pro
cess is powerless to keep out.
There is one last point over
which I am at odds: the conten
tion that socialization would
lead to increased utilization of
medical care and that this effect
is undesirable. First, based on
the experience of health plans
such as Kaiser, per capita ex
penditures for medical care ac
tually decreases with an im
proved organization of its deliv
ery.
Secondly, the clear implica
tion of your claim is that finan
cial barriers in the function they
presently serve, are the best way
to reduce unnecessary demand
for medical care. Without further
explanation one would be forced
to conclude that you believe
money bestows a mysterious
wisdom upon its possessor con
cerning his or her health. This
belief is not equalitarian.
If medicine is to survive this
century without becoming a
pawn of the political process, the
medical community must be
come more responsive to social
change.
But the prospects are not good.
Even in these articles, one can
see a pattern: Segal rebut Sar
toris, I rebut Segal. In the medi
cal profession, it is still all too
true that the common medical
interaction is a reactive one: pa
tient get sick, doctor responds.
By deed, by profession, and
maybe by nature reactionary,
perhaps we can't be blamed if a
little bit of it seeps into our polit
ical and social views. Thank
God, there are a few initiators
like David Sartoris around.
