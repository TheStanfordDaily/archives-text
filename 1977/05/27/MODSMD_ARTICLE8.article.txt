# Getting to the 'essence' of everything

Rob Docters

1 was talking to a person over at
Roble a short while ago. She was
speaking in mystical and un
clear ways about what consti
tuted her personality, identity,
and whether she would indeed
be "herself" in a few years.
Not surprisingly she was ask
ing herself what to most people
(perhaps rightly) seems like
another form of the question:
would she have maintained her
basic essence of identity over
that time?
The above is what prompts me
to write today. After some
thought 1 have concluded that
while useful in an informal im
precise way, the concept of "es
sence" has very great limitations
in answering various basic ques
tions and can create as many
problems as it answers.

Digging out the old American
College Dictionary I got the fol
lowing definition:
Essence, n., the inward nature,
true substance, or constitution of
anything.
The thing I note about this def
inition is that it states that there
is a definable, explicit property
that makes an object a member of
a class of items.
Yet 1 have never had anyone
ever satisfactorially explain to
me what the essence of some
class (except for a class of fully
identical items) of objects is.
Chair model
For instance taking the
ever-popular example of a
chair, 1 would suggest that there
is no explicit element essential
to anything's "chairness." Run
ning very briefly over some pos

sible "true constitutions" of a
chair we can see none are
adequate.
For instance, given the
suggestion that a chair is "some
thing one sits in," I would ask if
the recliner-chairs which one
lies down in are not a good
counter-example. Given that
"chairs have four legs and a
hack," one could ask why certain
types of stools, which are com
monly refered to as chairs, are
not included. If one were to pro
duce a viable definition of a
chair one would be forced to use
an arbitrariness that would viol
ate the idea of there being one
essential, unmistakable element
to a class of objects. This is not to
say that, for economy of lan
guage, the idea of "essence" is
ndt useful.
However, where economy of
language is less important than a
clear view of a situation, I
suggest the idea of essence not
be used?
Theories
Consider two propositions.
First that everything physical
can be seen as holding a position
in time and space. For instance,
grant that a person could be
"mapped out" in space as being
in a certain position, both with
' regard to his/her physical body,
and also with regard to the elec
trical impulses that form that
person's thoughts and
memories.
The second proposition is that
it is possible to conceive of
measuring the degree of differ
ence between one physical
"map" and another; as a person
(or anything) changes in time.
I add that such measurements
might not actually be noticeable
to us, just as some other physical
differences are unmeasurable to
us, 1 only suggest that consider
ing changes and differences in
such a light is useful.
Therefore, in deciding (e.g.)
what one wished to call a chair,
one could conceive of a set of
limits or tolerances within

which one would call the item a
chair. Possibly one would set
these requirements to match
what other's conceived of as a
chair.
At this point the reader might
comment that while he could
grant the method of classifying
objects by their degree of toler
ance from a model (as opposed to
the idea of essence, where an ob
ject must contain a specific ele
ment, to be classed) he can not
see any advantage in this system,
over the use of essence. In ordi
nary conversation 1 do not see a
great advantage either.
'Sameness
However, returning to the
question that I opened with,
there is a difference in outcome
when one asks a question like:
am I still the "same" person I
was in the past? If one were to
utilize the idea of essence in
answering this question, one
would first have to decide what
element of your body or charac
ter constitutes your essence. I
have not been able to reach a
reasonable, explicit answer to
that question. I add that if your
answer is not explicit, I accuse
you of indulging in mysticism
and, in the end, sacrificing your
clarity of thought.
If one uses the 'tolerances'
model 1 suggested above, 1 be
lieve one can reach some sort of
satisfactory answer. Presume
that at a base time you, as best
you could, "map out" your cor
poreal and mental identity.
Choosing whatever tolerances to
that position seem appropriate,
one could decide whether your
present self happened to fall
within those limits. Then a con
clusion of whether one was the
"same" person is possible. Such
a conclusion is either more dif
ficult or impossible, if one were
simply to ask the nebulous ques
tion of whether one still retained
one's former essence (presuming
one was able to clearly describe
it).
I add two comments. The first

is that given our level of aware
ness and knowledge, this "map
ping model" (to give it a name) is
not likely to give a very accurate
answer. However it does at least
give us a framework of thought;
were there to be an omniscient
being, it would find this solution
feasible, and the use of essence
either unfeasible or else less use
ful.
'Mapping model'
The second comment is that
the "mapping model" at least
makes the degree of arbitrariness
in tolerances (of differences to
models) explicit. The idea of es
sence muddies or denies the
view that classification of ob
jects is quite arbitrary. It
suggests that there are qualita
tive, rather than quantitative dif
ferences between things.
My final observation is that
another way in which a "map
ping model," system is more ef
fective than the use of essence is
simply that even if one could
think of one central, essential
element of some item, it may be
more useful to check a broader
scope of elements. For instance
take someone who has changed
in every respect (i.e. personality,
the atoms in her body, her physi
cal appearance, etc.) in very
small ways. This person would
then have lost their essence, and
hence their former identity. Yet
that might not be a useful (or
practical) way to view it. Given
reasonable tolerances in the
mapping model, it would pro
vide a more servicable descrip
tion. I note that one could rede
fine essence with provisions that
would overcome this difficulty,
however this violates the idea
that essence contains a central
immutable feature.
1 strongly suggest that after
you consider it, it becomes clear
that the idea of essence is the
phlogiston of philosophical
theory, and should be discarded
for a more explicit system of
identification and classification.
