WE BUY RECORDS!
t Not everyone can afford a top-line stereo system, nor can everyone j
afford only records in pristine mint shape. There is a big demand for
used albums in less-than-perfect shape, if the price is right!
1 We at Comics and Comix are servicing this need. This doesn't mean 1
that we do not handle cream-of-the-crop records, nor that we
: specialize in frisbee quality, party records. It just means that we BUY
MORE and CHARGE LESS.
We also trade comics for records, sci-fi books for records, and
c vice-versa! :
