If Red Cross hadn't trained
young Lars Alecksen in
lifesaving techniques, last
summer Adam Gauthier
just might have ended up
one more drowning statis
tic. (Adam's alive and well
today, thank you. and in
the first grade in Man
itowoc, Wisconsin.)
We're not asking for
medals (Lars is the one
who deserves those). But
we do need your con
tinued support Help us.
Because the things we do
really help. In your own
neighborhood. And
across America. And the
world.
