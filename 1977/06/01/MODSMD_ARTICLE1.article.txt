# Cowell continues diaphragm recall
## 
### John Nielsen 
Officials at Cowell Student Health
Center reported yesterday they are
continuing their efforts to recall "sev
eral defective batches" of Koroflex
diaphragms issued this year.
According to Connie Starr, a nurse
practitioner at Cowell, the recall is
continuing because "we have abso
lutely no way of knowing how many
were issued."
The diaphragm, a contraceptive de
vice, is a thin rubber dome attached to
flexible, rubber-covered metal ring.
Though usually about three inches in
diameter, diaphragms come in various
sizes, and must be individually fitted
by a physician.
Until the advent of the Pill, the
diaphragm, along with the in
trauterine device (lUD), was the most
widely used contraceptive method.
Koroflex distributors. Holland-
Rantos announced last month that
their diaphragms, sold nationally and
abroad for several years, are often
dangerously thin around the edge.
Frequently the rim tears and sperm can
enter the uterus.
The initial announcement received
widespread attention. However, lately
interest has declined. Officials at Cow
ell are concerned the lack of inteiest
might convince some people that the
problem no longer exists.
"This is obviously no laughing mat
ter," said Starr, "but its not time to
panic either."
"Just check the rubber around the
edge," said Starr, "and you'll be able to
rip the bad ones with no effort at all.
Besides, the lot numbers should be on
the rim, and we know which lots are
defective."
Starr said the defective lot numbers
are on record at Cowell.
Many local drugstores simply sent
back all recent shipments from Korof
lex with the defective lot number, ac
cording to a Payless spokesman. "We
don't even have the numbers any
more," he continued.
Without defects diaphragms still fail
between five and 20 per cent of the
time, due to incorrect insertion or dis
lodgement.
This is not the first contraceptive
problem which Cowell has dealt with.
In early 1976, Cowell was criticized
for prescribing the sequential birth
control pill even though the Food and
Drug Administration had made pre
liminary moves to remove them from
the market because of suspected
cancer links.
