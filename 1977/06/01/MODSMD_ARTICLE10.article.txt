# Moral outrage inconsistent

Many have gone before me to
rightly decry South Africa's evil
apartheid system. Hut one be
comes curious about the appa
rently selective moral outrage of
some of the anti-apartheid
forces. For example, President
Jimmy Carter halted chrome im
ports from Rhodesia. Many
applauded his act of economic
boycott. But now we buy our
chrome from Russia, a nation
Carter himself acknowledges is
no champion of human rights.
Has the U.S. acted because of its
high moral principles, or has it
simply made a politically ac
ceptable move in the eyes of the
majority of the world's nations?
Local opponents of apartheid
seem selective as well. Why is
there no sit-in at the Old Union
to protest Ford's investment in
Russia at the massive Kama
River truck factory? On sheer
numbers alone, the Soviets have
brutally murdered and impris
oned millions more than the
white South Africans, yet there
is no protest here of their at
rocities.
Many of these people who op
pose apartheid also oppose col
onialism, and rightly so. But

why is there no outrage or de
monstrations against the biggest
colonialists today, the Russians?
The Soviet army dominates
Eastern Europe against its
wishes. The Soviets grabbed
land from both Communist
China and Japan after World War
11, and have consistently refused
to negotiate its return. Yet, we
only hear tirades against "U.S.
imperialism." Why?
These are not the only excep
tions. During the Vietnam War
years, many of the opponents of
apartheid condemned U.S. sup
port of the corrupt Cambodian
dictator, Lon Nol. But now, none
of them protest the bloody re
gime of the Khmer Rouge, who
have hacked thousands to death
with axes and hoes. Surely,
those who opposed Lon Nol
cannot think the Cambodians are
better off under the com
munists? Still, we hear no pro
tests about the new rulers of
Cambodia.
And with the sole exception of
Uganda, anti-apartheidists
never condemn the horrible op
pression in other black African
nations. One gets the uneasy

feeling that those who protest
apartheid will turn their backs
on a black slaughter of whites in
Rhodesia and South Africa, as
long as it is done under "major
ity rule."
All people should strive to be
consistent when they make
moral judgments. One who con
demns Cuba, Russia and Cam
bodia because they are oppres
sive communist regimes must
not exclude Chile, South Korea
and Iran because they are op
pressive anti-communist re
gimes.
But here, as at many places,
the ones who condemned the
Vietnam War and now condemn
apartheid are the ones who claim
to have enlightened moral con
sciences. They claim to be
champions of human rights, but
they show themselves to be
blind at best or hypocrites at
worst for ignoring the horrors of
the communist and socialist dic
tatorships in the world. Let us
hope that those who claim to
judge the world will strive to be
consistent.
