# Chinese students conflict
## 
### 
1 am a Stanford student from
Taiwan. I have requested the
Daily withhold my name not so
much to protect myself but to
protect those innocent people
who are known to be my friends
and to whom harm may come if
it is suspected that they have as
sociated themselves with a
"communist bandit," for such
will be my label and such will be
the charge against my friends
and these are serious charges
that can cost our liberties in
Taiwan.
Currently the Stanford
Chinese Student Association
(CSA) is embroiled in a serious
conflict, which illustrates viv
idly the situation described by
Kurt Cobb in his recent article
(Daily, April 27-29). There are
approximately 250 Chinese
foreign students at Stanford, a
majority of them are members of
the CSA, a nominally apolitical
organization oriented toward
services and social activities.
Recently a reporter for the
Palo Alto Times was given a VIP
tour of Taiwan and he filed a
series of reports favorable to
ward the Chiang regime there
(Palo Alto Times, March 23-
April 4).
A Stanford graduate student
in the history department,
Randy Stross, who speaks
Chinese and has studied in
Taiwan tooka dissentingviewto
those articles in the form of a let
ter to the editor (Palo Alto
Times, April 12).

Subsequently, Stross was con
tacted by phone at least five
times by Taiwan students,
everyone of them reluctant to
give his own name and everyone
chided him for his dissenting
view. The fifth caller, under per
sistent inquiry blurted out his
identity "I'm CSA vice
president, isn't that good
enough?" Later, Stross called
the CSA vice president Hung-po
Chao, and Chao confirmed that
he was indeed the caller. Some
of the calls were made at late
.hours requesting a meeting bet
ween Stross and the caller. One
such meeting was arranged with
a Yuan Fang. Meanwhile other
letters to the editor have ap
peared in the Palo Alto Times
disputing Stross's assertions.
Among the authors is one Jia
dong Shea (Palo Alto Times,
April 21).
A few weeks ago Cobb made
an admirable attempt to expose
the political atmosphere under
which the Chinese Students at
Stanford live. His article and
himself were subsequently at
tacked by Chao (Daily, May 12)
and Pang and Shea (Daily, May
6). Chao, Pang and Shea are all
Stanford Students from Taiwan
and are ail outspokenly loyal to
the KMT (Chiang's Nationalist
Party, the ruling clique). Perhaps
they all spoke "purely out of
love, concern, and goodwill" for
their government, as they claim.
But the questions that are bother
ing a lot of students are one: Did

Chao abuse his office in the CSA
and subvert the CSA Constitu
tion, Two: Why have the pro-
KMT forces here become so ac
tive in the vehement attack
against any and all statements
which do not show the KMT in
the most favorable light. The
first matter, still under investiga
tion, also has been brought to the
attention of the I-Center, ASSU
and dean of student affairs.
Chao's denials have appeared
in the May issue of the CSA
Newsletter in two versions. The
English version politely claimed
that he had "never talked to
Stross on behalf of the CSA"; the
Chinese version translated: ". . .
Thus 1 decided to g ; ve him
(Stross) a lesson on the phone,
but who would have thought
that little bastard was not only
ungrateful to his teacher, but
also bit back. . . . Just consider I
have met a mad dog. . .
For the second question, let's
look at the government that Chao
and the others defend. Economi
cally, the island is a mere ap
pendage to the American and
Japanese economies. In order to
maintain their tenuous position
in a crisis-filled inflationary
world economy, the rich in
Taiwan, represented by the
KMT, are ever more eager to
prostitute the country's labor
force to foreign capital. Strikes
are illegal, labor protection is
next to non-existent, while laws
are tailor-made to facilitate the
removal of profits from the is
lands by the foreign multi-na
tionals. The net result of the re
gime's economic policies is that a
Taiwan today possesses one of
the largest foreign debt in the
world, an extremely low-sided
income distribution, high infla
tion. and high unemployment.
Politically it is the practitioner
of the longest rule by martial law
(28 years). The KMT has de
veloped its secret police network
into one of the most effective ter
ror organization in the world.
After the mass jailing and
slaughtering of the opposition
leaders in the 19505, there is
now no open opposition against
the regime within the island.
Diplomatically, the KMT re
gime is recognized by only 24 of
the world's 250 nations. The
U.S. is thd only major govern
ment that still support the KMT.
That support, in the form of mas
sive arms shipment and
economic investments, is most

critical for the survival of the re
gime. Without that support, the
Chinese people on Taiwan
would have kicked the KMT into
the Pacific long time ago. The
KMT knows that and is particu
larly worried these days because
the U.S. is realigning its military
posture in East Asia. That is why
the KMT and its defenders are
using heavy handed tactics to
manipulate public opinions here
in the states frantically attacking
all those who justly criticize the
regime, be they Chinese or
American.
The struggle against KMT is
the struggle of the Chinese
people against oppression, but
the American people should be
informed of the role that their
government plays in this strug
gle. Cobb's articles have made a
positive contribution to that un
derstanding. Pang and Shea's
accusation that Cobb have
created "single-handedly an un
precedented atmosphere of sus
picion among us (the Chinese
students)" is a lie that no
Chinese student would believe.
The intense struggles between
those who are against the KMT
and those who defend it have
been in existence before Cobb
was born.
Cobb ought to be commended
for his painstaking efforts in re
ferencing every allegation made
in his article, i.e., either to the
students he interviewed, the
Amnesty International report,
published articles, or the Taiwan
consulate in San Francisco.
Moreover, the articles contained
an informative section on the re
cent history and politics of
Taiwan.
The question as to whether the
allegations and statements are in
fact true can be settled to each
reader's satisfaction only
through his practices and further
investigations. To those of us
who have tasted the "love, con
cern, and goodwill" of the KMT
we feel that Cobb has been overly
cautious by allowing facts to re
main merely as allegations.
Truth is never neutral, it will
light up the path for some and
cast shadows for others.
The future for the fascist re
gime on Taiwan is as dark as the
future for the Chinese People on
Taiwan is bright.

tacked by Chao (Daily, May 12)
and Pang and Shea (Daily, May
6). Chao, Pang and Shea are all
Stanford Students from Taiwan
and are ail outspokenly loyal to
the KMT (Chiang's Nationalist
Party, the ruling clique). Perhaps
they all spoke "purely out of
love, concern, and goodwill" for
their government, as they claim.
But the questions that are bother
ing a lot of students are one: Did

Chao abuse his office in the CSA
and subvert the CSA Constitu
tion, Two: Why have the pro-
KMT forces here become so ac
tive in the vehement attack
against any and all statements
which do not show the KMT in
the most favorable light. The
first matter, still under investiga
tion, also has been brought to the
attention of the I-Center, ASSU
and dean of student affairs.
Chao's denials have appeared
in the May issue of the CSA
Newsletter in two versions. The
English version politely claimed
that he had "never talked to
Stross on behalf of the CSA"; the
Chinese version translated: ". . .
Thus 1 decided to g ; ve him
(Stross) a lesson on the phone,
but who would have thought
that little bastard was not only
ungrateful to his teacher, but
also bit back. . . . Just consider I
have met a mad dog. . .
For the second question, let's
look at the government that Chao
and the others defend. Economi
cally, the island is a mere ap
pendage to the American and
Japanese economies. In order to
maintain their tenuous position
in a crisis-filled inflationary
world economy, the rich in
Taiwan, represented by the
KMT, are ever more eager to
prostitute the country's labor
force to foreign capital. Strikes
are illegal, labor protection is
next to non-existent, while laws
are tailor-made to facilitate the
removal of profits from the is
lands by the foreign multi-na
tionals. The net result of the re
gime's economic policies is that a
Taiwan today possesses one of
the largest foreign debt in the
world, an extremely low-sided
income distribution, high infla
tion. and high unemployment.
Politically it is the practitioner
of the longest rule by martial law
(28 years). The KMT has de
veloped its secret police network
into one of the most effective ter
ror organization in the world.
After the mass jailing and
slaughtering of the opposition
leaders in the 19505, there is
now no open opposition against
the regime within the island.
Diplomatically, the KMT re
gime is recognized by only 24 of
the world's 250 nations. The
U.S. is thd only major govern
ment that still support the KMT.
That support, in the form of mas
sive arms shipment and
economic investments, is most

critical for the survival of the re
gime. Without that support, the
Chinese people on Taiwan
would have kicked the KMT into
the Pacific long time ago. The
KMT knows that and is particu
larly worried these days because
the U.S. is realigning its military
posture in East Asia. That is why
the KMT and its defenders are
using heavy handed tactics to
manipulate public opinions here
in the states frantically attacking
all those who justly criticize the
regime, be they Chinese or
American.
The struggle against KMT is
the struggle of the Chinese
people against oppression, but
the American people should be
informed of the role that their
government plays in this strug
gle. Cobb's articles have made a
positive contribution to that un
derstanding. Pang and Shea's
accusation that Cobb have
created "single-handedly an un
precedented atmosphere of sus
picion among us (the Chinese
students)" is a lie that no
Chinese student would believe.
The intense struggles between
those who are against the KMT
and those who defend it have
been in existence before Cobb
was born.
Cobb ought to be commended
for his painstaking efforts in re
ferencing every allegation made
in his article, i.e., either to the
students he interviewed, the
Amnesty International report,
published articles, or the Taiwan
consulate in San Francisco.
Moreover, the articles contained
an informative section on the re
cent history and politics of
Taiwan.
The question as to whether the
allegations and statements are in
fact true can be settled to each
reader's satisfaction only
through his practices and further
investigations. To those of us
who have tasted the "love, con
cern, and goodwill" of the KMT
we feel that Cobb has been overly
cautious by allowing facts to re
main merely as allegations.
Truth is never neutral, it will
light up the path for some and
cast shadows for others.
The future for the fascist re
gime on Taiwan is as dark as the
future for the Chinese People on
Taiwan is bright.

1 am a Stanford student from
Taiwan. I have requested the
Daily withhold my name not so
much to protect myself but to
protect those innocent people
who are known to be my friends
and to whom harm may come if
it is suspected that they have as
sociated themselves with a
"communist bandit," for such
will be my label and such will be
the charge against my friends
and these are serious charges
that can cost our liberties in
Taiwan.
Currently the Stanford
Chinese Student Association
(CSA) is embroiled in a serious
conflict, which illustrates viv
idly the situation described by
Kurt Cobb in his recent article
(Daily, April 27-29). There are
approximately 250 Chinese
foreign students at Stanford, a
majority of them are members of
the CSA, a nominally apolitical
organization oriented toward
services and social activities.
Recently a reporter for the
Palo Alto Times was given a VIP
tour of Taiwan and he filed a
series of reports favorable to
ward the Chiang regime there
(Palo Alto Times, March 23-
April 4).
A Stanford graduate student
in the history department,
Randy Stross, who speaks
Chinese and has studied in
Taiwan tooka dissentingviewto
those articles in the form of a let
ter to the editor (Palo Alto
Times, April 12).

Subsequently, Stross was con
tacted by phone at least five
times by Taiwan students,
everyone of them reluctant to
give his own name and everyone
chided him for his dissenting
view. The fifth caller, under per
sistent inquiry blurted out his
identity "I'm CSA vice
president, isn't that good
enough?" Later, Stross called
the CSA vice president Hung-po
Chao, and Chao confirmed that
he was indeed the caller. Some
of the calls were made at late
.hours requesting a meeting bet
ween Stross and the caller. One
such meeting was arranged with
a Yuan Fang. Meanwhile other
letters to the editor have ap
peared in the Palo Alto Times
disputing Stross's assertions.
Among the authors is one Jia
dong Shea (Palo Alto Times,
April 21).
A few weeks ago Cobb made
an admirable attempt to expose
the political atmosphere under

veloped its secret police network
into one of the most effective ter
ror organization in the world.
After the mass jailing and
slaughtering of the opposition
leaders in the 19505, there is
now no open opposition against
the regime within the island.
Diplomatically, the KMT re
gime is recognized by only 24 of
the world's 250 nations. The
U.S. is thd only major govern
ment that still support the KMT.
That support, in the form of mas
sive arms shipment and
economic investments, is most

critical for the survival of the re
gime. Without that support, the
Chinese people on Taiwan
would have kicked the KMT into
the Pacific long time ago. The
KMT knows that and is particu
larly worried these days because
the U.S. is realigning its military
posture in East Asia. That is why
the KMT and its defenders are
using heavy handed tactics to
manipulate public opinions here
in the states frantically attacking
all those who justly criticize the
regime, be they Chinese or
American.
The struggle against KMT is
the struggle of the Chinese
people against oppression, but
the American people should be
informed of the role that their
government plays in this strug
gle. Cobb's articles have made a
positive contribution to that un
derstanding. Pang and Shea's
accusation that Cobb have
created "single-handedly an un
precedented atmosphere of sus
picion among us (the Chinese
students)" is a lie that no
Chinese student would believe.
The intense struggles between
those who are against the KMT
and those who defend it have
been in existence before Cobb
was born.
Cobb ought to be commended
for his painstaking efforts in re
ferencing every allegation made
in his article, i.e., either to the
students he interviewed, the
Amnesty International report,
published articles, or the Taiwan
consulate in San Francisco.
Moreover, the articles contained
an informative section on the re
cent history and politics of
Taiwan.
The question as to whether the
allegations and statements are in
fact true can be settled to each
reader's satisfaction only
through his practices and further
investigations. To those of us
who have tasted the "love, con
cern, and goodwill" of the KMT
we feel that Cobb has been overly
cautious by allowing facts to re
main merely as allegations.
Truth is never neutral, it will
light up the path for some and
cast shadows for others.
The future for the fascist re
gime on Taiwan is as dark as the
future for the Chinese People on
Taiwan is bright.

1 am a Stanford student from
Taiwan. I have requested the
Daily withhold my name not so
much to protect myself but to
protect those innocent people
who are known to be my friends
and to whom harm may come if
it is suspected that they have as
sociated themselves with a
"communist bandit," for such
will be my label and such will be
the charge against my friends
and these are serious charges
that can cost our liberties in
Taiwan.
Currently the Stanford
Chinese Student Association
(CSA) is embroiled in a serious
conflict, which illustrates viv
idly the situation described by
Kurt Cobb in his recent article
(Daily, April 27-29). There are
approximately 250 Chinese
foreign students at Stanford, a
majority of them are members of
the CSA, a nominally apolitical
organization oriented toward
services and social activities.
Recently a reporter for the
Palo Alto Times was given a VIP
tour of Taiwan and he filed a
series of reports favorable to
ward the Chiang regime there
(Palo Alto Times, March 23-
April 4).
A Stanford graduate student
in the history department,
Randy Stross, who speaks
Chinese and has studied in
Taiwan tooka dissentingviewto
those articles in the form of a let
ter to the editor (Palo Alto
Times, April 12).

Subsequently, Stross was con
tacted by phone at least five
times by Taiwan students,
everyone of them reluctant to
give his own name and everyone
chided him for his dissenting
view. The fifth caller, under per
sistent inquiry blurted out his
identity "I'm CSA vice
president, isn't that good
enough?" Later, Stross called
the CSA vice president Hung-po
Chao, and Chao confirmed that
he was indeed the caller. Some
of the calls were made at late
.hours requesting a meeting bet
ween Stross and the caller. One
such meeting was arranged with
a Yuan Fang. Meanwhile other
letters to the editor have ap
peared in the Palo Alto Times
disputing Stross's assertions.
Among the authors is one Jia
dong Shea (Palo Alto Times,
April 21).
A few weeks ago Cobb made
an admirable attempt to expose
the political atmosphere under
which the Chinese Students at
Stanford live. His article and
himself were subsequently at
tacked by Chao (Daily, May 12)
and Pang and Shea (Daily, May
6). Chao, Pang and Shea are all
Stanford Students from Taiwan
and are ail outspokenly loyal to
the KMT (Chiang's Nationalist
Party, the ruling clique). Perhaps
they all spoke "purely out of
love, concern, and goodwill" for
their government, as they claim.
But the questions that are bother
ing a lot of students are one: Did

Chao abuse his office in the CSA
and subvert the CSA Constitu
tion, Two: Why have the pro-
KMT forces here become so ac
tive in the vehement attack
against any and all statements
which do not show the KMT in
the most favorable light. The
first matter, still under investiga
tion, also has been brought to the
attention of the I-Center, ASSU
and dean of student affairs.
Chao's denials have appeared
in the May issue of the CSA
Newsletter in two versions. The
English version politely claimed
that he had "never talked to
Stross on behalf of the CSA"; the
Chinese version translated: ". . .
Thus 1 decided to g ; ve him
(Stross) a lesson on the phone,
but who would have thought
that little bastard was not only
ungrateful to his teacher, but
also bit back. . . . Just consider I
have met a mad dog. . .
For the second question, let's
look at the government that Chao
and the others defend. Economi
cally, the island is a mere ap
pendage to the American and
Japanese economies. In order to
maintain their tenuous position
in a crisis-filled inflationary
world economy, the rich in
Taiwan, represented by the
KMT, are ever more eager to
prostitute the country's labor
force to foreign capital. Strikes
are illegal, labor protection is
next to non-existent, while laws
are tailor-made to facilitate the
removal of profits from the is
lands by the foreign multi-na
tionals. The net result of the re
gime's economic policies is that a
Taiwan today possesses one of
the largest foreign debt in the
world, an extremely low-sided
income distribution, high infla
tion. and high unemployment.
Politically it is the practitioner
of the longest rule by martial law
(28 years). The KMT has de
veloped its secret police network
into one of the most effective ter
ror organization in the world.
After the mass jailing and
slaughtering of the opposition
