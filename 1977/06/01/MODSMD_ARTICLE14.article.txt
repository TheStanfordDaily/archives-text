SRI, South Africa
Hack in the late 19605, Stan
ford was associated with another
great evil force, the Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI). The insti
tute was part of the University,
and it had the audacity to con
duct research for the U.S. gov
ernment.
What to do about such a terri
ble situation? A study commit
tee recommended that the Uni
versity and SKI be separated, and
the University agreed. But the
radicals of that day of course dis
agreed, arguing that SRI should
be retained and reformed. With
drawal or divestment would be
highly "immoral," they said, for
it would mean that the Univer
sity would be abdicating its re
sponsibility to bring about
change at SRI.
Today, we find Stanford
linked to South Africa. How to

bring about change? Should the
University retain its ties with
corporations doing business
there and attempt to bring about
reforms? Of course not — that
would be highly "immoral."The
only answer is withdrawal of in
vestment.
How interesting that the ar
gyments of the dissidents al
ways are figured so as to bring
about a confrontation. That's the
stuff that sit-ins and trashings
are made of.

As the end of the year draws
nigh, I am moved to draw the
following to the attention of cer
tain individuals on campus. It
seems that in the past, departing
students with dogs have been
known to take their pets to the
center of campus and simply

walk away. I learned of this in
tal king wit h the H u ma ne Society
and several local breeders, all of
whom indicated a disinclination
to provide dogs for students be
cause of this and similar acts of
irresponsibility.
At least two basic points for
the edification of those ostensi
bly otherwise intelligent people
who think of pets as existing
pretty much for their enjoyment
and convenience alone: (1) Dogs
have a potential life span of ap
proximately 15 years. It is sim
ply not fair to procure a dog for
immediate gratification and to
expect that it can be given away
or sold when the time comes for
travel or a job and apartment in
the city. Just like people, pets are
only truly placeable when very
young, fetching, and malleable.
(2) NEUTER. That means
females and males.
It never ceases to amaze me
when pet owners tell me that
"my dog is entitled to its own sex
life" or "we're thinking of breed
ing it" as the dog in question is at
that very moment out wandering
the neighborhood. An animal is
not going to miss what it does
not know and one unneutered
animal can be responsible for lit

erally thousands of progeny.
Millions for that matter, the
vast, vast majority of whom die
anything but pleasantly. Please
do your part towards the control
of pet overpopulation.

known to take their pets to the
center of campus and simply

walk away. I learned of this in
tal king wit h the H u ma ne Society
and several local breeders, all of
whom indicated a disinclination
to provide dogs for students be
cause of this and similar acts of
irresponsibility.
At least two basic points for
the edification of those ostensi
bly otherwise intelligent people
who think of pets as existing
pretty much for their enjoyment
and convenience alone: (1) Dogs
have a potential life span of ap
proximately 15 years. It is sim
ply not fair to procure a dog for
immediate gratification and to
expect that it can be given away
or sold when the time comes for
travel or a job and apartment in
the city. Just like people, pets are
only truly placeable when very
young, fetching, and malleable.
(2) NEUTER. That means
females and males.
It never ceases to amaze me
when pet owners tell me that
"my dog is entitled to its own sex
life" or "we're thinking of breed
ing it" as the dog in question is at
that very moment out wandering
the neighborhood. An animal is
not going to miss what it does
not know and one unneutered
animal can be responsible for lit

erally thousands of progeny.
Millions for that matter, the
vast, vast majority of whom die
anything but pleasantly. Please
do your part towards the control
of pet overpopulation.

History

SRI, South Africa
Hack in the late 19605, Stan
ford was associated with another
great evil force, the Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI). The insti
tute was part of the University,
and it had the audacity to con
duct research for the U.S. gov
ernment.
What to do about such a terri
ble situation? A study commit
tee recommended that the Uni
versity and SKI be separated, and
the University agreed. But the
radicals of that day of course dis
agreed, arguing that SRI should
be retained and reformed. With
drawal or divestment would be
highly "immoral," they said, for
it would mean that the Univer
sity would be abdicating its re
sponsibility to bring about
change at SRI.
Today, we find Stanford
linked to South Africa. How to

bring about change? Should the
University retain its ties with
corporations doing business
there and attempt to bring about
reforms? Of course not — that
would be highly "immoral."The
only answer is withdrawal of in
vestment.
How interesting that the ar
gyments of the dissidents al
ways are figured so as to bring
about a confrontation. That's the
stuff that sit-ins and trashings
are made of.

As the end of the year draws
nigh, I am moved to draw the
following to the attention of cer
tain individuals on campus. It
seems that in the past, departing
students with dogs have been
known to take their pets to the
center of campus and simply

walk away. I learned of this in
