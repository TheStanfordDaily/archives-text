## Opinions Matchmaker, matchmaker 
### 
Bill Wien

In answer to Abby Koeder's column on marriage
(Daily, May 20), after searching unsuccessfully
four years for J'epouse juste, 1 am ready to seek the
service of a matchmaker. Despite my experience
and achievements, women consider me "just
another bright-eyed, eager graduate." Obviously, 1
have failed to make a dent in the system, haven't 1?
So influenced was 1 as a freshman by the blissful
and calm relationships portrayed in Leave It to
Heaver that 1 dropped into the "O" for a "hunk o'
beer." Later, consciousness expanded, I sought
that elusive reciprocal role structure so needed by
us all. Seated across from the brunette of my
dreams, a chemical engineer who fulfilled my
every masochistic wish for dependency, 1 fell for
her delectable reason. "You really know little of
intuitive inter-personal matrices," she volun
teered.
I met this fledgling careerist a year later over a

cupof coffee I laid down another $1.15 for the next
cup. I said, "Let's go toSteppenwolf at the
flicks this Sunday; it may bring quickening to you
and bring your imagination wombfruit as well."
As she stood up, horrified, it was clear our prob
lems would go unresolved. "L 7, really Alber's
Wall — my God, he speaks in semi-colons," she
muttered.
best these reminiscences become grist for future
conversations with dinner-cooking, wash-doing,
kids-transporting Mom, who has nothing much to
do but listen to this paper-shuffling, screen
washing, kids-disciplining Dad of years hence, I
thought I should write.
Please advise me. They are going to give me,
spouseless, a diploma, and, having alternately
plumbed the depths of fantasy and reality for the
answer, 1 was tempted to plumb again the latter.
