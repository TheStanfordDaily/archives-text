Robert Smith

1 came to Stanford four years ago to pursue
a general libera] education. I found one due
mainly to my own efforts and motivation and
due little to the University's assistance. The
University seems to place far too much em
phasis on research and graduate studies and
manifests too much concern with the science
parts of the University — undoubtedly the
three areas where the money is — to the
detriment of humanities, social sciences,
special and innovative education and over
seas studies.
As a supposed institution of liberal arts,
Stanford'is grossly failing. Nowhere is this
more evident than in the fact that the Univer
sity has had to resort to a mandatory western
civilization requirement to teach students
about the foundations of our culture.
Such a course should exist, but it should

be voluntary and it should be the Universi
ty's job to create an atmosphere in which
students want to enroll in such broadly
based civilization studies (and not merely
western).
Yet the student has trouble sensing such a
commitment to general liberal education on
the part of the university when at the same
time as it makes mandatory three quarters of
western civ, it also considers such actions as
eliminating the Stanford overseas studies
program in Britain, where undoubtedly the
best understanding of western culture as an
American knows it can be gained and which
is in itself an invaluable study, living and
learning experience.
Instead of being innovative, Stanford usu
ally retrenches. What other major univer
sities do not have fields of study or major

courses in Arabic, Hebrew, near eastern
studies, Jewish history, and other minority
and third world studies?
The student sees little effort by the Univer
sity to proceed toward an innovative, diverse
yet fundamental liberal arts education;
he/she only sees how important money is to a
big-time university.
The student is also disgusted by brilliant
lecturers and tearhcrs being denied tenure
because of "insufficient" research.
The student has a right to demand more
from the university, and to be dissatisfied
until he/she receives it. Stanford University
is selling a commodity — learning — to a
se'ect body of consumers — Stanford stu
dents. It is the University's responsibility to
make sure that the merchandise is up to par.
