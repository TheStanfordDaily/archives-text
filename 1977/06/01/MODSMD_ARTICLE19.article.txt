# Review panel recommendation
## FDA should lift secrecy 
### 
Washington (AP) — A special
panel of experts said yesterday
that the lid of secrecy under
which the Food and Drug Ad
ministration operates should be
lifted and the public given a look
at the way the agency decides
the fate of new drugs.
Dr. David Rail, a member of
the review panel on new drug
regulations, told a news confer
ence, "The FDA really is a large
black box that no one can penet
rate. No one knows what hap
pens inside."
The panel said the system of
new drug regulation by FDA "is
fundamentally sound" and the
agency is neither pro- nor anti
industry. But it said the system
needs substantial improve
ments.
The panel's final report, sum
marizing 16 lengthy interim re
ports and two years of probes,
recommended that Congress

adopt legislation to remove the
trade secrets policy that the FDA
now uses to keep data on the
salety and effectiveness of new
drugs hidden from public view.
Among other findings and re
commendations, the panel said:
The law requiring the
pharmaceutical industry to
prove its products "both safe and
effective before marketing
should be changed "to reflect the
lact that assessing the value and
ultimate approvability of a new
drug entails weighing its risks
against its overall benefits." No
drug is absolutely safe or always
effective, the panel said.
—Public-interest representa
tives with full voting rights
should be added to the host of
expert advisory committees that
help the FDA decide which
drugs can be marketed "so that
consumers will have a voice in
deciding whether the social be

nefits of new drugs outweigh
their risks."
—The agency should contract
with independent laboratories to
spot check the results of animal
tests that drug companies con
duct to prove the effectiveness of
their product. Pilot programs
should be undertaken as a possi
ble step toward removing the
testing process from the drug
manufacturing community.
The panel said the present
practice of requiring the indus
try to run its own tests on new
drugs results in an inherent con
flict of interest because the tester
is also the potential seller and
therefore has a financial stake in
the invention.
—The FDA's physical plants,
now spread over a wide area,
should be "relocated" on a
single, well-equipped campus
which has adequate library and
research facilities and the qual
ity of professional staff should be
raised by awarding higher
salaries and training to improve
the scientific expertise of the
agency.
FDA Commissioner L3onald
Kennedy welcomed the docu
ment as a "comprehensive and
useful report."

adopt legislation to remove the
trade secrets policy that the FDA
now uses to keep data on the
salety and effectiveness of new
drugs hidden from public view.
Among other findings and re
commendations, the panel said:
The law requiring the
pharmaceutical industry to
prove its products "both safe and
effective before marketing
should be changed "to reflect the
lact that assessing the value and
ultimate approvability of a new
drug entails weighing its risks
against its overall benefits." No
drug is absolutely safe or always
effective, the panel said.
—Public-interest representa
tives with full voting rights
should be added to the host of
expert advisory committees that
help the FDA decide which
drugs can be marketed "so that
consumers will have a voice in
deciding whether the social be

nefits of new drugs outweigh
their risks."
—The agency should contract
with independent laboratories to
spot check the results of animal
tests that drug companies con
duct to prove the effectiveness of
their product. Pilot programs
should be undertaken as a possi
ble step toward removing the
testing process from the drug
manufacturing community.
The panel said the present
practice of requiring the indus
try to run its own tests on new
drugs results in an inherent con
flict of interest because the tester
is also the potential seller and
therefore has a financial stake in
the invention.
—The FDA's physical plants,
now spread over a wide area,
should be "relocated" on a
single, well-equipped campus
which has adequate library and
research facilities and the qual
ity of professional staff should be
raised by awarding higher
salaries and training to improve
the scientific expertise of the
agency.
FDA Commissioner L3onald
Kennedy welcomed the docu
ment as a "comprehensive and
useful report."
