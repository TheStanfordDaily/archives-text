# Frosh enrollment up; housing may suffer
## 
### Doug Hyde 
About 100 more high school stu
dents than expected have accepted
placement in next year's freshman
class, possibly causing a "housing
crunch," according to Dean of Admis
sions Fred Hargadon.
The admissions office accepted
2515 applicants for the class of 1981
and 1600 have agreed to come. The
University was expecting roughly
1500 applicants to accept, according to
Hargadon,
The "housing crunch" could lead to
a decrease in the number of transfer
students offered admission, Hargadon
said. The extent of possible side effects
in housing should be known by the
end of June, he said.
Stanford received 9900 applications
this year, said Hargadon.
Of the applicants, 1530 students had
a 4.0 high school grade average while
5712 had better than a 3.5 average.
Among applicants, 38 per cent were
women.
Of the 2515 offered admissions,
roughly 64 per cent enrolled, up from
61 per cent last year. Hargadon said

this is the second highest rate in the
country, behind Harvard with 72 per
cent.
Hargadon said he expects the
number of both women and minority
students enrolling this fall to be higher
than enrollment of both groups in fall
1976.
Of the 1600, 695 are women, as
compared to 642 last year.
For minorities, 91 blacks, 89
chicanos and 12 native Americans
have said they will enter the Class of
1981. This is 11 more blacks, 10 more
chicanos and four more native Ameri
cans than ar > «n this year's freshman
class. *»
Hargadon said roughly 78 per cent
of next year's freshman class will come
from public schools. He also said he
believed about half the class will re
ceive some financial aid.
Hargadon said because of the unex
pectably high student acceptance rate,
no people will be admitted from the
wait list.
He stressed that the numbers are ten
tative and subject to some change bet
ween now and fall registration.
