# Summer Clearinghouse to open
## 
### 
Students who are unassigned after round two of
the housing draw will have some help finding
housing for the fall, according to Colleen Pollock,
director of the Summer Clearinghouse.
"The Clearinghouse is a special student-run ex
tension of the Rental Housing Office that is de
signed to help students locate suitable housing,"
said Pollock.
This year's Clearinghouse will run from Aug. 29
through the last day of Registration, Sept. 27 and
will be staffed by 10 student volunteers. Listings of
rooms, apartments and houses for rent or to share
as well as room and board in exchange for work
options will be posted daily, she said.
Other services include free phones for checking
listings; lists of roommates wanted; information
about local transportation, bike paths and shop
ping; maps of the mid-peninsula; landlord-tenant

relations and leasing information; and current
housing office waiting lists. In addition, said Pol
lock, the Clearinghouse staff will plan social ac
tivities.
A Clearinghouse Hotel will be set up in Stern
Hall with doubles costing $3.30 per night and
singles $0.60, she said. The rates include linen.
"Students should plan to arrive as soon after
Aug. 29 as possible," Pollock said, because "the
selection of listings will be at its peak at that time."
She added that "HO per cent of those who arrived
before the fourth day of the Clearinghouse in past
years have found housing within two days.
"The goal of the Clearinghouse is not to do all of
the work for the students, but to make their search
for off campus housing easier," she said.
A Stanford ID or letter of admission is required
to use the house, Pollock added.
