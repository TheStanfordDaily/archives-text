## Translations provide intimacy 
### Reviewed by John Gery 
Sequoia magazine, Spring 1977
issue, $1.50.
It is appropriate that the
spring issue of Sequoia
magazine, devoted entirely to
the art of translation, has been
dedicated to American poet and
translator Robert Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald's translation of the
Odyssey stands as its premier
rendition in modern English,
and he is responsible in a sig
nificant way for its great popu
larity among Americans of this
generation.
The interview with Fitzgerald
which highlights this issue in it
self validates the price of admis
sion ($1.50). Interviewed by
David Stern, Fitzgerald discus
ses in some detail his experience
of translating Homer, so that for
those who already have read his
translation, it provides an en
lightening afterword. For those
who haven't read it, they now
have a good reason.
Sequoia's editors recognize
Fitzgerald's highly regarded
position in the world of letters,
and one cannot but be touched
by the intelligent and reverent
manner in which Simmons,
kojima, Gioia and company
have put the Stanford product
together in Fitzgerald's honor.
Except for a very short piece of
fiction and a second interview
(with Mary de Rachewiltz,
whose name hopefully will
someday appear in print without
the epithet "Ezra Pound's
daughter"), the spring issue
consists entirely of foreign
poems, translated by a hand
some catalogue of translator
poets.
The poems themselves origi
nate from four continents. Un
fortunately, however, the editors
have not seen fit to include an
index of references to the origi
nal versions. This is a mistake,
especially in those cases where
the original is readily available
to most readers, either in im
ported texts or in texts with fac
ing English literal translations
(i.e. Goethe, Pasternak, Rilke,
Verlaine, Proust, etc.).
Why translations?
A provocative translation
serves at least three ends:
—it provides the immediate
pleasure of reading and hearing,
in the intimacy we have with our
own language, the "foreign" ex
pression of an idea, particularly

when its original language is not
accessible to us;
—in the case of an an
thologized translation, it en
courages us to discover more of
the writer's work elsewhere —
indeed, perhaps even to learn his
language in order to enjoy him in
his own terms; and
—it sends the literal-minded
among us off to the library so that
we might compare differences in
texts. Doing that teaches the dif
ferences between various cul
tures and languages through di
rect experience of the differ
ences in their creative self
expressions.
Even though the Sequoia ful
fills the first of these ends admir
ably, it puts too little emphasis
on the latter two. The notable ex
ceptions are Marcia Falk's ver
sion of "The Song of Songs," the
Hearne paraphrase of the infam
ous poem of Mei Sheng, and Re
xroth's discussion and transla
tion of Yosano Akiko's epig
rams. In those selections the
translators almost over-explain
themselves and overshadow
their own handicraft. In most
cases, a simple reference with
each poem, as in the wonder
fully soothing "paraphrases" of
Horace by Ted Hars, would have
sufficed to spur us to increase
our understanding and, there
fore, our pleasure.
Seasoned translators
One can expect that keeley's
translations of Greek, Rexroth's
of Japanese, Singh's of Italian,
and Tomlinson's of any of sev
eral languages will be good, be
cause these are seasoned trans
lators and accomplished poets in
their own right. Sequoia's read
ers are fortunate to enjoy their
contributions anywhere, but
especially, in this issue, keeley's
translation of "Fan" by Angelos
Sikelianos and Tomlinson's of
"The Dead of Mountains" by
Giuseppe Ungaretti.
The most pleasant surprise in
this issue, though, is the prowess
demonstrated by the younger
translators. Notice the rich yet
vivid diction in these lines from
Pasternak translated by Mark
Rudman:
The wind lifts alfalfa laughter,
blows a kiss down the valleys,
gorges on marshberries, crawls,
smears its lips with ferns,
tickles the river's cheek with a
branch
or - turning sour - ferments in

the reeds.
Or, admire instead the
double-edged clarity Anne Lucy
Tinkom has retained from the
Latin in these lines from"The
Grammarian" in the Carmina
Burana:
Such laughter spills from her
mouth
but I seek another source,
hidden,
more jolly.
If there I lay, I would decline her
parts,
give case by case,
nor consider the timing of tenses
but conjugate quickly.
First time in English
kenji Miyazama's "Unmoved
by Wind" (translated by
Hironaka and Mumford), the
epigrams of Luxorius (translated
by Art Beck), and Enrique Lihn's
"Sea Breeze" (translated by John
Felstiner) also bear mentioning
here, because these poems have

not appeared before in any En
glish versions.
The literary ghost of Ezra
Pound haunts these pages, but
without tarnishing their own
glitter. It was Pound, after all,
who made the statement that all
significant literature should be
re-translated for every new gen
eration of readers. In that regard,
one can rest assured that
Sequoia's translators, as
Fitzgerald says about himself,
have followed "the whole con
temporary tradition of saying
things in a living way. . not
any particular poet." That is to
say, this special translation issue
is certainly a colluhorative an
thology.
For example, of the five poems
translated from Rilke, three are
found in M.D. Herter Norton's
Translations from the Poetry of
R.M. Rilke (W.W. Norton, 1938;
also available in paperback), and
all are worthy of a cross

examination. In the Sequoia, Art
Beck has a fascinating transla
tion of the sonnet "Archaic
Torso of Apollo." Beck suspends
the poetic conventions of Rilke's
form (by using 17 rather than 14
lines) and prefers, instead, to
enhance the sense of the German
through the advantages of bro
ken lines and stanzaic variation.
Referring to a sculpture of
Apollo that lacks both head and
legs, Rilke effects the shift from
the octet to the sextet (lines 6-10).
Even if one doesn't know Ger
man, one notices how Beck
spreads these same lines over
seven lines and three stanzas. By
violating the original form,
Sequoia's translator frees him
self to adapt the literal meaning
of the words to a rhythm more
natural to American speech. Our
understanding is more im
mediate than with Norton's
translation, yet it is equally pre
cise.
