Hard Feelings, a novel by Don
Bredes. New York: Atheneum.

Hard Feelings is an impressive
first novel by Don Bredes, who is
currently studying here at Stan
ford. Bredes, who is a recipient
of the Wallace Stegner fellow
ship, presents an entertaining
and moving account of several
turbulent months in the life of a
New York teenager.
Bernie Hergruter, at the
novel's outset, is calmly in
volved in the frustrations and
goals of high school life; with his
best friend-confessor Lee he
finds himself beset with the pe
rennial male adolescent chal
lenge of losing one's virginity.
Idle discussion of the mysteries
of the sex act lead to direct action
when the boys make a $10 wager
on which of the two will be the
first to sample the fruits of sexual
pleasure.
Definitely in a Summer of '42
vein, the opening scenes of the
novel are quite successful in cap
turing the humorous and the
humorously painful aspects of
budding sexuality. Author Bre

des pulls no punches in his lan
guage and consequently pre
sents a strikingly faithful rep
resentation of back-row, locker
room dialogue; while behind the
boasting and challenging are the
concerns and insecurity of two
young men.
Deformed and deranged
Against this setting Bernie
finds himself in trouble with
Richard Linwood, a deformed
and deranged fellow student at
his high school. A series of
threatening maneuvers on Lin
wood's part and a disastrous at
tempt to win the $10 wager
motivate Bernie to run away
from Long Island and seek his
fortune with a rich uncle who
lives in Ohio.
The young man's journey to
find himself is a deeply-rooted
part of American literary tradi
tion; yet Bernie Hergruter is no
modern-day Huckleberry Finn
or Holden Gaulfield, for his
journey only reveals to him more
closely the futility of trying to
run away from one's problems.
Still unsure of what to do Bernie
returns home.
Bredes is at his best in present

ing brief moments of great inten
sity and Hard Feelings abounds
in striking scenes which linger
in the mind after the book is put
down, such as Bernie's en
counter with a homosexual
while hitch-hiking to Ohio, his
unnerving experience with
Richard Linwood on the school
tennis courts, and his frustrating
meetings with school officials.
Returning to Long Island,
Bernie is again assailed by Lin
wood, who attempts to extort
him. The novel's climax, though
exciting, is somehow unsatisfy
ing. One has a feeling that Bre
des is forcing his ending on
characters who have developed
a life of their own through the
course of the novel. The ending
would have benefited from a
less hurried conclusion; al
though the danger of extending a
novel that already runs over 350
pages is obvious, a novel as care
fully plotted as Hard Feelings
deserves a more leisurely paced
finish.
Into manhood
While the plot of a teenage
boy's growth into manhood is
one that has received great popu

larity in recent years, Bernie
Hergruter is a character who
manages to attain a good degree
of individuality amid his
numerous fictional counter
parts. Although the first person
narrative technique limits the
depth of Brede's prose, in the
long run he succeeds in bringing
his narrator distinctly to life.

The character of Richard Lin
wood is, unfortunately, under
developed. The narrative struc
ture of the novel prevents the
reader from getting a clear
glimpse into Linwood's mind;
yet flashbacks to a previous
period when Richard and Bernie

were friends could have been
used to a much greater extent.
Linwood is a fascinatingly
enigmatic character, and it is the
uncertainties about him which
leave the book's finish partially
unsatisfying.
In his first novel Don Bredes
has produced an entertaining
and highly readable book. Obvi
ously geared for the popular
market Hard Feelings retains a
good deal of sophistication and
experimentation. It will be in
teresting to see what Bredes, cur
rently writing his second novel
with the aid of a Wallace Stegner
fellowship, will produce in the
future.
