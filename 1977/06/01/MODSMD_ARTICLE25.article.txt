## Theatre/karen caesar Edge of hysteria lacking in Neil Simon's 'California Suite' 
### 
From the playwright and
screenwriter who brought us to
the brink of hysteria with The
Odd Couple (both the play and
the movie), who made us laugh
and cry with Sweet Charity, from
the artist who created Barefoot
in the Park, Last of the Hedhot
Lovers, The Sunshine Boys, etc.,
etc., comes another exercise in
would-be devastating comedy,
California Suite.
The man responsible for all
this laughter, Neil Simon, is
probably the most successful
writer to bombard Broadway
(and now Hollywood), in the last
20 years. California Suite, a
spin-off of the immensely suc
cessful Plaza Suite, is currently
engaged at San Francisco's Cur
ran Theatre, and, though it stays
true to Simon's genius, it does
not do it justice. Sure it is clever

and funny and insightful, but
that element of hysteria is con
spicuously absent. My stomach
muscles did not hurt when 1 left
the theatre; Simon was disap
pointing.
But the mostly audi
ence in the packed theatre obvi
ously enjoyed it. Indeed, this
story of the comings and goings
to and from Suite 203-204 of the
Beverly Hills Hotel had much
with which over-40 sophisti
cated cosmopolitanites could
identify.
Stereotypes
The play consisted of a series
of "playlets" centering around a
married couple (or couples) who
come to I.os Angeles to visit.
Simon of course capitalizes on
every single stereotype in exis
tence about Southern California
and Los Angeles ("This entire

city smells like an overripe can
taloupe"), which is easy for him
to do since most of his characters
have a caustic wit and are
oriented toward the East (read:
New York City).
Vincent Gardenia (remember
Frank Lorenzo on All in the
Family?), Penny Fuller, Rosem
ary Prinz and Kenneth Haigh
star in Suite, all taking turns as
residents of 203-204. Gardenia is
absolutely smashing as the
overweight, over-40 and over
enthusiastic tourist from
Philadelphia who comes out
West for his nephew's Bar
Mitzvah and wakes up with an
extremely hung-over, virtually
comatose prostitute lying next to
him and no recollection of how
she got there. When wife Millie
flies in that morning and arrives
at the hotel, Gardenia tries his

hardest to keep her from enter
ing the bedroom. Never has to
tally physical slupshtick com
edy been so successful.
Simon s comedy is usually
more cerebral; Gardenia's wait
ings, frantic bumbling and
pleading came as a surprise, yet
succeeded because the man is an
extremely talented serio-comic
actor. It was Gardenia, along
with his marvelously enthusias
tic co-actor Rosemary Prinz and
some of Simon's most acerbic
one-liners which kept this vig
nette from resembling a worn,
Love, American Style rerun.
Sin
When wife Millie enters the
bedroom part of the suite, after
much hemming and hawing, she
finally evokes an honest re
sponse from her loving husband.
1 have sinned. 1 have transgres

sed. 1 have committed adultery,"
her hubby admits contritely. "In
her case, it's more like nec
rophilia!" Millie bellows back.
She has lost her temper: "If you
tell me you have been carrying
on with a helpless paralytic...l
don't believe it. Marvin, don't
play on my sympathy," she says.
Simon, who usually strives to
be somewhat realistic in his
storylines, has obviously given
up the ship. It is hard to believe
in this day and age that after 15
years of marriage Millie would
divorce Marvin just because of a
one night stand Marvin doesn't
even remember. Of course they
kiss and make up in the end but
the whole premise is so implaus
ible that you have to wonder if
Simon was just experimenting
with his ability to write vehicles
for heavily physical comedy. He

was lucky here; with an actor
any less talented than Gardenia
or one who couldn't make her
naivete as believable as could
Prinz, this "playlet" would have
fallen irretrieveably flat.
In another playlet with Penny
Fuller as a fortyish ultra
sophisticated super-caustic
divorcee (out from Manhattan to
retrieve her daughter from her
ex-husband who has "gone
California"), Simon really lets
the one-liners fly. Only to native
Californians are the cliches tire
some; Easterners and converts to
the ineffable California "lifes
tyle" can truly appreciate and
identify with them and see them
as only mild distortions of truth.
Stagey
Penny Fuller is somewhat un
believable in her role as the di
vorcee; her toughness is superfi

cial, and she is too conscious of
her dialogue. She is never con
versational, but is always the
"stage actress" whose every
word is audible in the parking
lot and deafening in the second
balcony. Finally, she is far too
self-conscious in all but the
fourth playlet (she is in three of
them). If she would loosen up a
bit and not appear to try so hard,
perhaps she would be able to do
Simon comedy the way it should
be done. For now, she should
probably stick to Shakespeare.
It is hard to take offense at Si
mon's California stereotypes, for
they are so funny and, not unfor
tunately, so true. Kenneth Haigh
is perfect as the California-ized
husband who has given up
cigarettes, drinks only apple
juice, has four dogs, runs five
miles every morning, swims 20
laps every night, plays eight sets
of tennis on weekends, eats
natural and unprocessed foods,
plays country and classical
guitar, mountain climbs, etc.
Fun-loving
The last playlet proved to be
the most disappointing because
it had the most potential. Two
fun-loving couples are at the end
of a three-week vacation to
gether and the strains of too
much togetherness are starting
to show. When Rosemary Prinz
breaks her foot playing tennis,
hubby Vincent Gardenia blames
ex-best friend Kenneth Haigh for
his lob. He frantically calls down
to the front desk for a doctor.
"You should have told them
what kind of doctor," says his
wife. "This is Beverly Hills.
They'll probably send a
psychiatrist."
Pretty soon, a free-for-all
breaks loose and everyone is sw
inging at everybody else. The in
sults fly, tempers flare. "I've had
enough!" shouts Haigh. "I need
a vacation!" Gardenia counters
with a threat, and adds "...or I'll
backhand you to death!"—the
ultimate way to die in Southern
California—to be beaten to death
with a tennis racquet.
Simon has added another big
success to his long string of big
successes. California Suite is no
thing earth-shaking, and is defi
nitely not among his top five or
even top 10 efforts. It will never
be a comedic classic, but it suf
fices for light evening enter
tainment. Unfortunately, it
seems as if after moving to
California himself from Manhat
tan, Simon felt obligated to write
about the traumatic experience
of fighting off "Galifornia
ization."

ing the bedroom. Never has to
tally physical slupshtick com
edy been so successful.
Simon s comedy is usually
more cerebral; Gardenia's wait
ings, frantic bumbling and
pleading came as a surprise, yet
succeeded because the man is an
extremely talented serio-comic
actor. It was Gardenia, along
with his marvelously enthusias
tic co-actor Rosemary Prinz and
some of Simon's most acerbic
one-liners which kept this vig
nette from resembling a worn,
Love, American Style rerun.
Sin
When wife Millie enters the
bedroom part of the suite, after
much hemming and hawing, she
finally evokes an honest re
sponse from her loving husband.
1 have sinned. 1 have transgres

sed. 1 have committed adultery,"
her hubby admits contritely. "In
her case, it's more like nec
rophilia!" Millie bellows back.
She has lost her temper: "If you
tell me you have been carrying
on with a helpless paralytic...l
don't believe it. Marvin, don't
play on my sympathy," she says.
Simon, who usually strives to
be somewhat realistic in his
storylines, has obviously given
up the ship. It is hard to believe
in this day and age that after 15
years of marriage Millie would
divorce Marvin just because of a
one night stand Marvin doesn't
even remember. Of course they
kiss and make up in the end but
the whole premise is so implaus
ible that you have to wonder if
Simon was just experimenting
with his ability to write vehicles
for heavily physical comedy. He

was lucky here; with an actor
any less talented than Gardenia
or one who couldn't make her
naivete as believable as could
Prinz, this "playlet" would have
fallen irretrieveably flat.
In another playlet with Penny
Fuller as a fortyish ultra
sophisticated super-caustic
divorcee (out from Manhattan to
retrieve her daughter from her
ex-husband who has "gone
California"), Simon really lets
the one-liners fly. Only to native
Californians are the cliches tire
some; Easterners and converts to
the ineffable California "lifes
tyle" can truly appreciate and
identify with them and see them
as only mild distortions of truth.
Stagey
Penny Fuller is somewhat un
believable in her role as the di
vorcee; her toughness is superfi

cial, and she is too conscious of
her dialogue. She is never con
versational, but is always the
"stage actress" whose every
word is audible in the parking
lot and deafening in the second
balcony. Finally, she is far too
self-conscious in all but the
fourth playlet (she is in three of
them). If she would loosen up a
bit and not appear to try so hard,
perhaps she would be able to do
Simon comedy the way it should
be done. For now, she should
probably stick to Shakespeare.
It is hard to take offense at Si
mon's California stereotypes, for
they are so funny and, not unfor
tunately, so true. Kenneth Haigh
is perfect as the California-ized
husband who has given up
cigarettes, drinks only apple
juice, has four dogs, runs five
miles every morning, swims 20
laps every night, plays eight sets
of tennis on weekends, eats
natural and unprocessed foods,
plays country and classical
guitar, mountain climbs, etc.
Fun-loving
The last playlet proved to be
the most disappointing because
it had the most potential. Two
fun-loving couples are at the end
of a three-week vacation to
gether and the strains of too
much togetherness are starting
to show. When Rosemary Prinz
breaks her foot playing tennis,
hubby Vincent Gardenia blames
ex-best friend Kenneth Haigh for
his lob. He frantically calls down
to the front desk for a doctor.
"You should have told them
what kind of doctor," says his
wife. "This is Beverly Hills.
They'll probably send a
psychiatrist."
Pretty soon, a free-for-all
breaks loose and everyone is sw
inging at everybody else. The in
sults fly, tempers flare. "I've had
enough!" shouts Haigh. "I need
a vacation!" Gardenia counters
with a threat, and adds "...or I'll
backhand you to death!"—the
ultimate way to die in Southern
California—to be beaten to death
with a tennis racquet.
Simon has added another big
success to his long string of big
successes. California Suite is no
thing earth-shaking, and is defi
nitely not among his top five or
even top 10 efforts. It will never
be a comedic classic, but it suf
fices for light evening enter
tainment. Unfortunately, it
seems as if after moving to
California himself from Manhat
tan, Simon felt obligated to write
about the traumatic experience
of fighting off "Galifornia
ization."
From the playwright and
screenwriter who brought us to
the brink of hysteria with The
Odd Couple (both the play and
the movie), who made us laugh
and cry with Sweet Charity, from
the artist who created Barefoot
in the Park, Last of the Hedhot
Lovers, The Sunshine Boys, etc.,
etc., comes another exercise in
would-be devastating comedy,
California Suite.
The man responsible for all
this laughter, Neil Simon, is
probably the most successful
writer to bombard Broadway
(and now Hollywood), in the last
20 years. California Suite, a
spin-off of the immensely suc
cessful Plaza Suite, is currently
engaged at San Francisco's Cur
ran Theatre, and, though it stays
true to Simon's genius, it does
not do it justice. Sure it is clever

and funny and insightful, but
that element of hysteria is con
spicuously absent. My stomach
muscles did not hurt when 1 left
the theatre; Simon was disap
pointing.
But the mostly audi
ence in the packed theatre obvi
ously enjoyed it. Indeed, this
story of the comings and goings
to and from Suite 203-204 of the
Beverly Hills Hotel had much
with which over-40 sophisti
cated cosmopolitanites could
identify.
Stereotypes
The play consisted of a series
of "playlets" centering around a
married couple (or couples) who
come to I.os Angeles to visit.
Simon of course capitalizes on
every single stereotype in exis
tence about Southern California
and Los Angeles ("This entire

city smells like an overripe can
taloupe"), which is easy for him
to do since most of his characters
have a caustic wit and are
oriented toward the East (read:
New York City).
Vincent Gardenia (remember
Frank Lorenzo on All in the
Family?), Penny Fuller, Rosem
ary Prinz and Kenneth Haigh
star in Suite, all taking turns as
residents of 203-204. Gardenia is
absolutely smashing as the
overweight, over-40 and over
enthusiastic tourist from
Philadelphia who comes out
West for his nephew's Bar
Mitzvah and wakes up with an
extremely hung-over, virtually
comatose prostitute lying next to
him and no recollection of how
she got there. When wife Millie
flies in that morning and arrives
at the hotel, Gardenia tries his

hardest to keep her from enter
ing the bedroom. Never has to

her dialogue. She is never con
versational, but is always the
"stage actress" whose every
word is audible in the parking
lot and deafening in the second
balcony. Finally, she is far too
self-conscious in all but the
fourth playlet (she is in three of
them). If she would loosen up a
bit and not appear to try so hard,
perhaps she would be able to do
Simon comedy the way it should
be done. For now, she should
probably stick to Shakespeare.
It is hard to take offense at Si
mon's California stereotypes, for
they are so funny and, not unfor
tunately, so true. Kenneth Haigh
is perfect as the California-ized
husband who has given up
cigarettes, drinks only apple
juice, has four dogs, runs five
miles every morning, swims 20
laps every night, plays eight sets
of tennis on weekends, eats
natural and unprocessed foods,
plays country and classical
guitar, mountain climbs, etc.
Fun-loving
The last playlet proved to be
the most disappointing because
it had the most potential. Two
fun-loving couples are at the end
of a three-week vacation to
gether and the strains of too
much togetherness are starting
to show. When Rosemary Prinz
breaks her foot playing tennis,
hubby Vincent Gardenia blames
ex-best friend Kenneth Haigh for
his lob. He frantically calls down
to the front desk for a doctor.
"You should have told them
what kind of doctor," says his
wife. "This is Beverly Hills.
They'll probably send a
psychiatrist."
Pretty soon, a free-for-all
breaks loose and everyone is sw
inging at everybody else. The in
sults fly, tempers flare. "I've had
enough!" shouts Haigh. "I need
a vacation!" Gardenia counters
with a threat, and adds "...or I'll
backhand you to death!"—the
ultimate way to die in Southern
California—to be beaten to death
with a tennis racquet.
Simon has added another big
success to his long string of big
successes. California Suite is no
thing earth-shaking, and is defi
nitely not among his top five or
even top 10 efforts. It will never
be a comedic classic, but it suf
fices for light evening enter
tainment. Unfortunately, it
seems as if after moving to
California himself from Manhat
tan, Simon felt obligated to write
about the traumatic experience
of fighting off "Galifornia
ization."
From the playwright and
screenwriter who brought us to
the brink of hysteria with The
Odd Couple (both the play and
the movie), who made us laugh
and cry with Sweet Charity, from
the artist who created Barefoot
in the Park, Last of the Hedhot
Lovers, The Sunshine Boys, etc.,
etc., comes another exercise in
would-be devastating comedy,
California Suite.
The man responsible for all
this laughter, Neil Simon, is
probably the most successful
writer to bombard Broadway
(and now Hollywood), in the last
20 years. California Suite, a
spin-off of the immensely suc
cessful Plaza Suite, is currently
engaged at San Francisco's Cur
ran Theatre, and, though it stays
true to Simon's genius, it does
not do it justice. Sure it is clever

and funny and insightful, but
that element of hysteria is con
spicuously absent. My stomach
muscles did not hurt when 1 left
the theatre; Simon was disap
pointing.
But the mostly audi
ence in the packed theatre obvi
ously enjoyed it. Indeed, this
story of the comings and goings
to and from Suite 203-204 of the
Beverly Hills Hotel had much
with which over-40 sophisti
cated cosmopolitanites could
identify.
Stereotypes
The play consisted of a series
of "playlets" centering around a
married couple (or couples) who
come to I.os Angeles to visit.
Simon of course capitalizes on
every single stereotype in exis
tence about Southern California
and Los Angeles ("This entire

city smells like an overripe can
taloupe"), which is easy for him
to do since most of his characters
have a caustic wit and are
oriented toward the East (read:
New York City).
Vincent Gardenia (remember
Frank Lorenzo on All in the
Family?), Penny Fuller, Rosem
ary Prinz and Kenneth Haigh
star in Suite, all taking turns as
residents of 203-204. Gardenia is
absolutely smashing as the
overweight, over-40 and over
enthusiastic tourist from
Philadelphia who comes out
West for his nephew's Bar
Mitzvah and wakes up with an
extremely hung-over, virtually
comatose prostitute lying next to
him and no recollection of how
she got there. When wife Millie
flies in that morning and arrives
at the hotel, Gardenia tries his

hardest to keep her from enter
ing the bedroom. Never has to
tally physical slupshtick com
edy been so successful.
Simon s comedy is usually
more cerebral; Gardenia's wait
ings, frantic bumbling and
pleading came as a surprise, yet
succeeded because the man is an
extremely talented serio-comic
actor. It was Gardenia, along
with his marvelously enthusias
tic co-actor Rosemary Prinz and
some of Simon's most acerbic
one-liners which kept this vig
nette from resembling a worn,
Love, American Style rerun.
Sin
When wife Millie enters the
bedroom part of the suite, after
much hemming and hawing, she
finally evokes an honest re
sponse from her loving husband.
1 have sinned. 1 have transgres

sed. 1 have committed adultery,"
her hubby admits contritely. "In
her case, it's more like nec
rophilia!" Millie bellows back.
She has lost her temper: "If you
tell me you have been carrying
on with a helpless paralytic...l
don't believe it. Marvin, don't
play on my sympathy," she says.
Simon, who usually strives to
be somewhat realistic in his
storylines, has obviously given
up the ship. It is hard to believe
in this day and age that after 15
years of marriage Millie would
divorce Marvin just because of a
one night stand Marvin doesn't
even remember. Of course they
kiss and make up in the end but
the whole premise is so implaus
ible that you have to wonder if
Simon was just experimenting
with his ability to write vehicles
for heavily physical comedy. He

was lucky here; with an actor
any less talented than Gardenia
or one who couldn't make her
naivete as believable as could
Prinz, this "playlet" would have
fallen irretrieveably flat.
In another playlet with Penny
Fuller as a fortyish ultra
sophisticated super-caustic
divorcee (out from Manhattan to
retrieve her daughter from her
ex-husband who has "gone
California"), Simon really lets
the one-liners fly. Only to native
Californians are the cliches tire
some; Easterners and converts to
the ineffable California "lifes
tyle" can truly appreciate and
identify with them and see them
as only mild distortions of truth.
Stagey
Penny Fuller is somewhat un
believable in her role as the di
vorcee; her toughness is superfi

cial, and she is too conscious of
her dialogue. She is never con
versational, but is always the
