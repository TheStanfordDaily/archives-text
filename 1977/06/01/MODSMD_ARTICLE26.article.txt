## From Broadway to the Bay Area with Kenneth Waissman 
### 
Kenneth Waissman, the
jeweler's son from Baltimoreand
the co-producer of the Broadway
hit Grease, is the first to admit
that being in his business is a
risky proposition. He calls it the
most demanding one imagina
ble, requiring an extraordinary
energy output on a consistent
level. "If anyone approached
Broadway with a rational ap
preciation of the pros and cons of
it, no one would ever get into the
business."
"It's a disease," he shrugs, and
admits to being happily
afflicted. He feels a strong need
to experience great highs — but
recognizes the possibility of
deep lows. You have to be a
gambler with 1) overflowing
self-confidence and 2) a strong
survival instinct. In case of a
flop, you pick up the pieces and
move on to the next show. But, if
it doesn't flop — "you've created
something that will live for
years."
Greose is doing just that. From
a script by two Chicago men who
based it on their experiences as
teacher and student in the '50s, it
is in its sixth year on Broadway.
Now it is also on the road, com
ing to Concord Pavilion June 2,
San Rafael June 3-5 and San Jose
June 9-12.
Waissman is taking a chance
bringing theatre to towns that
are not usually known for cul
ture, but he shrugs off the risk —
it's the nature of his business.

And it's a natural process for
him. He's been involved in
theatre since childhood, and
can't consider being in any other
occupation. As a child, he staged
shows in his basement. He is
admittedly obsessed with
theatre, so much so that his wife,
Maxine Fox, is also his co
producer.
Intense
Together they've done Grease
and Over Here with the Andrews
Sisters. Just as he can't imagine
not working in theatre, he can't
imagine not being married to
someone in the business. So in
tense is his fascination, "I would
either bore someone to death or
would be frustrated explaining
everything to them."
He and his wife have perhaps
an ideal situation. "We can't af
ford to indulge in child-like an
gers. There's no time to get mad
because we're always on our way
to a meeting or something. We
have to work out our differ
ences." And so goes their old
fashioned marriage. Waissman
likens it to their forefathers'
days, when people worked to
gether on a farm eight hours a
day for 40 years.
The producer's job starts with
the script. He either initiates it
with an idea of his own (as
Waissman did with Over Here or
gets a script from the author and
has the latter develop it. "It's
very rare to get a good script.
There's a shortage of clever writ

ers," he says.
He then puts together a group
— the director, the choreog
rapher. the costumer, the set de
signer — who collaborate hold
ing the show as their final goal. It
is the producer's ability to col
lect people whose egos and ta
lents won't conflict with the
others that often makes or breaks
a show. "Lots of shows fell apart
because the director refused to
speak to the musical director, or

whatever. It's the producer's re
sponsibility to see that it stays
together. It's a delicate process,
like matchmaking."
Waissman speaks fluently
about the history and mechanics
of the theatre right up to the
moment. Today he discerns a
much-needed rejuvenation in
the theatre, perhaps brought on
by the over-whelming success of
A Chorus Line, and welcomes it.
The renaissance includes refur

bished theatres and record audi
ences, but most importantly, a
change from the youth-oriented
'60s. "Young writers now are
taking time to learn the craft,
hanging around successful writ
ers, inviting criticism. It's no
longer a crime to admit you can
learn from someone older."
And while Waissman and his
wife are two of the youngest
producers on Broadway, and is
glad at this rebirth, Waissman

has a respect for things past. It
shows in his work — Grease, a
'50s musical, Over Here, a '40s
musical. And if he could have
produced any show in history,
Waissman answers, "The Zieg
feld Follies — all of them, even
the ones that didn't make
money. They were the glints and
glamour of Broadway — Ameri
ca's image of glamour. They
gave the people fabulous es
capes."

lect people whose egos and ta
lents won't conflict with the
others that often makes or breaks
a show. "Lots of shows fell apart
because the director refused to
speak to the musical director, or

whatever. It's the producer's re
sponsibility to see that it stays
together. It's a delicate process,
like matchmaking."
Waissman speaks fluently
about the history and mechanics
of the theatre right up to the
moment. Today he discerns a
much-needed rejuvenation in
the theatre, perhaps brought on
by the over-whelming success of
A Chorus Line, and welcomes it.
The renaissance includes refur

bished theatres and record audi
ences, but most importantly, a
change from the youth-oriented
'60s. "Young writers now are
taking time to learn the craft,
hanging around successful writ
ers, inviting criticism. It's no
longer a crime to admit you can
learn from someone older."
And while Waissman and his
wife are two of the youngest
producers on Broadway, and is
glad at this rebirth, Waissman

has a respect for things past. It
shows in his work — Grease, a
'50s musical, Over Here, a '40s
musical. And if he could have
produced any show in history,
Waissman answers, "The Zieg
feld Follies — all of them, even
the ones that didn't make
money. They were the glints and
glamour of Broadway — Ameri
ca's image of glamour. They
gave the people fabulous es
capes."
Kenneth Waissman, the
jeweler's son from Baltimoreand
the co-producer of the Broadway
hit Grease, is the first to admit
that being in his business is a
risky proposition. He calls it the
most demanding one imagina
ble, requiring an extraordinary
energy output on a consistent
level. "If anyone approached
Broadway with a rational ap
preciation of the pros and cons of
it, no one would ever get into the
business."
"It's a disease," he shrugs, and
admits to being happily
afflicted. He feels a strong need
to experience great highs — but
recognizes the possibility of
deep lows. You have to be a
gambler with 1) overflowing
self-confidence and 2) a strong
survival instinct. In case of a
flop, you pick up the pieces and
move on to the next show. But, if
it doesn't flop — "you've created
something that will live for
years."
Greose is doing just that. From
a script by two Chicago men who
based it on their experiences as
teacher and student in the '50s, it
is in its sixth year on Broadway.
Now it is also on the road, com
ing to Concord Pavilion June 2,
San Rafael June 3-5 and San Jose
June 9-12.
Waissman is taking a chance
bringing theatre to towns that
are not usually known for cul
ture, but he shrugs off the risk —
it's the nature of his business.

And it's a natural process for
him. He's been involved in
theatre since childhood, and
can't consider being in any other
occupation. As a child, he staged
shows in his basement. He is
admittedly obsessed with
theatre, so much so that his wife,
Maxine Fox, is also his co
producer.
Intense
Together they've done Grease
and Over Here with the Andrews
Sisters. Just as he can't imagine
not working in theatre, he can't
imagine not being married to
someone in the business. So in
tense is his fascination, "I would
either bore someone to death or
would be frustrated explaining
everything to them."
He and his wife have perhaps
an ideal situation. "We can't af
ford to indulge in child-like an
gers. There's no time to get mad
because we're always on our way
to a meeting or something. We
have to work out our differ
ences." And so goes their old
fashioned marriage. Waissman
likens it to their forefathers'
days, when people worked to
gether on a farm eight hours a
day for 40 years.
The producer's job starts with
the script. He either initiates it
with an idea of his own (as
Waissman did with Over Here or
gets a script from the author and
has the latter develop it. "It's
very rare to get a good script.
There's a shortage of clever writ

ers," he says.
He then puts together a group
— the director, the choreog
rapher. the costumer, the set de
signer — who collaborate hold
ing the show as their final goal. It
is the producer's ability to col
lect people whose egos and ta
lents won't conflict with the
others that often makes or breaks
a show. "Lots of shows fell apart
