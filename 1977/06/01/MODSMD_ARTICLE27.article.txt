## Harris shines in 'Belle of Amherst' 
### 
Perfection seems so strong a word that I
hesitate to use it. And, yet, no defects appear
in The Belle of Amherst. A rarely seen pro
fessionalism gleams from the moment Julie
Harris walks on stage as a nervous Emily
Elizabeth Dickinson to her final curtsy. The
components of this play complement each
other so well that they are almost insepara
ble.
The play is a monologue with a recluse as
protagonist. Emily Dickinson, born in 1830,
wrote at least 1775 poems and is widely con
sidered one of America's greatest poets. She
lived a solitary life in Amherst, Mass., but
author William Luce and compiler Timothy
Helgeson create a striking and rather mis
chievous character from her letters and
poetry.
Julie Harris may be the only actor in the
play but, as Dickinson, she dons many roles.
She flounces across the stage as her pouting
sister, Lavinia, and wheezes vexingly as the

preacher, James Billings.
Dickinson, slightly withered and pale,
gains confidence as she addresses the audi
ence. Her barely wavering voice grows
strong and vibrant when reciting poetry.
"Words are my life," she says and during the
play she fights for a precise and exact ex
pression of her thoughts.
Although the audience laughts within the
first minute of the play, Harris also carries
them through the pain of death and failure.
She never lingers long on any subject but her
transitions flow smoothly and so naturally
that they seem unstructured.
Director Charles Nelson Reilly uses every
line to its utmost. His own career as an actor
gives him an understanding of how lines
should be read. He coordinates the dialogue
with simple fidgeting movements of nerv
ousness.
As both the set and lighting designer, H.R.
Poindexter adds enormously to the produc
tion's unity. His set, a raised, tilted oval,

creates intimacy in Berkeley's huge Zeller
bach Auditorium. The cluttered set serves as
both a living room and bedroom. Everything
on stage is visible and contributes to the at
mosphere of the mid-1880s. The browns and
beige of the set work with a background of
sky and trees shifting colors in accordance
with season and sentiment. When Dickinson
speaks earnestly the background dims con
siderably and stark, clear lights shape her
appearance as compelling and powerful as
her thoughts.
Theoni Aldrige costumes Harris in plain
white gowns and simple shawls. They ex
press Dickinson's self-acknowledgement as
an eccentric (since she only wore white in
her adult life) but also her straightforward
ness and innocent honesty. In her life she
was labeled "the moth of Amherst," but no
one can deny that through her work and
thoughts she deserves the title she fancied as
a teenager—"the Belle of Amherst."

with season and sentiment. When Dickinson
speaks earnestly the background dims con
siderably and stark, clear lights shape her
appearance as compelling and powerful as
her thoughts.
Theoni Aldrige costumes Harris in plain
white gowns and simple shawls. They ex
press Dickinson's self-acknowledgement as
an eccentric (since she only wore white in
her adult life) but also her straightforward
ness and innocent honesty. In her life she
was labeled "the moth of Amherst," but no
one can deny that through her work and
thoughts she deserves the title she fancied as
a teenager—"the Belle of Amherst."
Perfection seems so strong a word that I
hesitate to use it. And, yet, no defects appear
in The Belle of Amherst. A rarely seen pro
fessionalism gleams from the moment Julie
Harris walks on stage as a nervous Emily
Elizabeth Dickinson to her final curtsy. The
components of this play complement each
other so well that they are almost insepara
ble.
The play is a monologue with a recluse as
protagonist. Emily Dickinson, born in 1830,
wrote at least 1775 poems and is widely con
sidered one of America's greatest poets. She
lived a solitary life in Amherst, Mass., but
author William Luce and compiler Timothy
Helgeson create a striking and rather mis
chievous character from her letters and
poetry.
Julie Harris may be the only actor in the
play but, as Dickinson, she dons many roles.
She flounces across the stage as her pouting
sister, Lavinia, and wheezes vexingly as the

preacher, James Billings.
Dickinson, slightly withered and pale,
gains confidence as she addresses the audi
ence. Her barely wavering voice grows
strong and vibrant when reciting poetry.
"Words are my life," she says and during the
play she fights for a precise and exact ex
pression of her thoughts.
Although the audience laughts within the
first minute of the play, Harris also carries
them through the pain of death and failure.
She never lingers long on any subject but her
transitions flow smoothly and so naturally
that they seem unstructured.
Director Charles Nelson Reilly uses every
line to its utmost. His own career as an actor
gives him an understanding of how lines
should be read. He coordinates the dialogue
with simple fidgeting movements of nerv
ousness.
As both the set and lighting designer, H.R.
Poindexter adds enormously to the produc
tion's unity. His set, a raised, tilted oval,

creates intimacy in Berkeley's huge Zeller
bach Auditorium. The cluttered set serves as
both a living room and bedroom. Everything
on stage is visible and contributes to the at
mosphere of the mid-1880s. The browns and
beige of the set work with a background of
sky and trees shifting colors in accordance
with season and sentiment. When Dickinson
speaks earnestly the background dims con
siderably and stark, clear lights shape her
appearance as compelling and powerful as
her thoughts.
Theoni Aldrige costumes Harris in plain
