## Final gala fun for all 
### 
The San Francisco Ballet finished off their sea
son with a fine program on Sunday night with
their Second Annual Gala performance. The event
featured short excerpts from most of the pieces
which the company has performed over this sea
son. The night worked well and allowed the audi
ence to view the entire expanse of the San Fran
cisco Ballet's talent and choreographies.
The Gala also featured special appearances by
two of the American Ballet Theatre's finest dan
cers, young Yoko Morishita and the Cuban-born
Fernando Bujones. These two were paired in the
"Black Swan" pas de deux of Swan Lake. They
danced well; Bujones moved like a lion â€” with
grace and majesty, and Morishita performed with
an intoxicating charm. She looked a bit tired
though, and was not as smooth during strenuous
movements as she should have been.
Progress
Despite the excitement afforded by these guest
stars, the night really belonged to the San Fran
cisco Ballet. The nature of the Gala does not lend
itself to regular criticism; few of the pieces were
performed in their entirety and all have been seen
and reviewed earlier in the year. Instead, the Gala
should serve as a reminder of how far the San
Francisco Ballet has progressed over the past few
years and of the exciting talent and range of styles
that it now offers.
The current excellence of the Ballet is due in
large part to the dynamic interplay of its two artis
tic directors, Lew Christensen and Michael Smuin.
The styles of these two choreographers are a fine

complement. Smuin has an eye for drama and pas
sion, as demonstrated by his compositions
"Shinju," "Romeo and Juliet" and "Songs ot
Mahler."
On the other hand, Christensen opts for a bit of
light fun in his choreographic compositions. His
"Divertissement d'Auber," shows off Ghristen
sen's love for light-hearted entertainment.
Bravado
But the sheer dancing talent of the San Francisco
Ballet should be given as much credit for the com
pany's recent progress as the choreography. Tom
Ruud has long been a local favorite and this year
David McNaughton joined these stellar ranks.
McNaughton is a strong and dashing dancer with
admirable bravado.
Diana Weber is currently the Ballet's finest
female dancer. Susan Magno is also an exceptional
virtuoso on the stage.
Sunday night's audience added to the evening's
gala atmosphere. All shades of the Bay Area com
munity were represented and the crowd came
dressed in tuxes and gowns as well as jeans and
boots. After the performance, the audience joined
the dancers downstairs for a bit of champagne and
brie.
What merits special applause was the closing
scene of last Sunday's performance in which the
entire troupe plus the two choreographers were
showered on stage with a dazzling array of red,
white and blue streamers and confetti a la Yankee
Doodle Dandy. A spectacular ending toa spectacu
lar season.
