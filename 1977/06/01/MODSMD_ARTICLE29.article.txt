## 'Klagende Lied' technically brilliant 
### 
| Memorial Auditorium was crowded
last 1-riday, as the music department
gathered a*' its forces for an ambitious
program ot late nineteenth century
vocal-orchestral music. The Stanford
Chorus, Choir and Orchestra, directed by
Mark Starr, were featured in Brahms'
; Schicksalshed, Debussy's Three Noc
| furnes and Mahler s Das Klagende Lied.
t The entire performance was techni
j cally brilliant. Despite a few slips in the
more difficult parts — notably by the vio
lins and horns (understandable due to the
technical difficulty of the works) — and
some rough musical seams, the orchestra
played amazingly well. William Ram
| sey's chorus and choir, displayed their
usual warm enthusiasm and sensitive
musicianship.
The Schicksalslied (Song of Fate), is a
short work portraying a stoic solution to
| man's suffering. Although the orchestra
; had some problems with the tricky cross
! rhythms, they recouped nicely, and with
| Starr providing an even balance, gave the
! compassionate tinal section a deeply
moving rendition. Most impressive were
the Stanford Chorus and Choir. The altos
were heavenly, as the text demands, and
while the men provided a solid harmonic
base, the sopranos reached the heights of
| feeling.

Debussy's popular sketches —
"Clouds," "Festival," and "Sirens" —
failed to convey the unique impressionist
spirit of a Monet painting. When
"Clouds" began poorly, Starr became ag
gressive and pushed the tempo, ruining
the relaxed atmosphere. "Festival" went
better but "Sirens" was a disappoint
ment. The chorus and orchestra were not
well-integrated and, while the in
strumentalists failed to achieve the ir
idescent warmth of Debussy, the women
singers were consistently too loud. When
I hear "Sirens," 1 imagine the voices of
Homer's maidens floating over the water
— misty yet real — an effect which de
mands quiet intensity. Despite their
beautiful tone, the women did not
achieve this.
Mahler's secular cantata, Das Klagende
Lied (Song of Sorrow), is a work which
one often hears about but rarely gets a
chance to hear in concert.
The first half, entitled "The Minstrel,"
was flat and sloppy. Starr's tempos were
erratic, occasionally too fast, and the or
chestra lacked spirit. Only the Chorus and
Choir, though obviously pushed to their
technical limits, came through with an
inspired performance.
However, the second movement,
"Wedding Feast," picked up noticeably.

The tempos were sane and (he orchestra
began to get excited. The technical prob
lems of the first half were largely over
come and the work took shape, each verse
becoming a compelling statement. The
chorus and choir, occasionally having
trouble projecting over the Mahlerian or
chestra (which overflowed the stage) sang
with feeling and good musical judgment.
The offstage band was scrappy and a bit
crazed, but fun.
The vocal soloists, soprano Barbara
Swedlow, mezzo Irene Dalis and tenor
Raymond Nilsson, were uneven. Nilsson
sang as if he were in Pagliacci, with
wholesale disregard for both the pro
found sorrow and the dynamics in
Mahler's score. Swedlow could not hit
the high notes. Dalis, however, paid close
attention to the dynamics and lyrics. Her
voice was warm and full, yet slightly hol
low, in that paradoxical style which suits
Mahler perfectly.
I had the feeling throughout that the
performers were slightly over-rehearsed,
leading to a performance technically bril
liant but slightly lacking in spirit.
Nevertheless, the audience reacted
warmly to a successful evening — a grand
parting gift from Mark Starr, whose te
nure as orchestra director finished with
Friday's concert.

erratic, occasionally too fast, and the or
chestra lacked spirit. Only the Chorus and
Choir, though obviously pushed to their
technical limits, came through with an
inspired performance.
However, the second movement,
"Wedding Feast," picked up noticeably.

The tempos were sane and (he orchestra
began to get excited. The technical prob
lems of the first half were largely over
come and the work took shape, each verse
becoming a compelling statement. The
chorus and choir, occasionally having
trouble projecting over the Mahlerian or
chestra (which overflowed the stage) sang
with feeling and good musical judgment.
The offstage band was scrappy and a bit
crazed, but fun.
The vocal soloists, soprano Barbara
Swedlow, mezzo Irene Dalis and tenor
Raymond Nilsson, were uneven. Nilsson
sang as if he were in Pagliacci, with
wholesale disregard for both the pro
found sorrow and the dynamics in
Mahler's score. Swedlow could not hit
the high notes. Dalis, however, paid close
attention to the dynamics and lyrics. Her
voice was warm and full, yet slightly hol
low, in that paradoxical style which suits
Mahler perfectly.
I had the feeling throughout that the
performers were slightly over-rehearsed,
leading to a performance technically bril
liant but slightly lacking in spirit.
Nevertheless, the audience reacted
warmly to a successful evening — a grand
parting gift from Mark Starr, whose te
nure as orchestra director finished with
Friday's concert.
| Memorial Auditorium was crowded
last 1-riday, as the music department
gathered a*' its forces for an ambitious
program ot late nineteenth century
vocal-orchestral music. The Stanford
Chorus, Choir and Orchestra, directed by
Mark Starr, were featured in Brahms'
; Schicksalshed, Debussy's Three Noc
| furnes and Mahler s Das Klagende Lied.
t The entire performance was techni
j cally brilliant. Despite a few slips in the
more difficult parts — notably by the vio
lins and horns (understandable due to the
technical difficulty of the works) — and
some rough musical seams, the orchestra
played amazingly well. William Ram
| sey's chorus and choir, displayed their
usual warm enthusiasm and sensitive
musicianship.
The Schicksalslied (Song of Fate), is a
short work portraying a stoic solution to
| man's suffering. Although the orchestra
; had some problems with the tricky cross
! rhythms, they recouped nicely, and with
| Starr providing an even balance, gave the
! compassionate tinal section a deeply
moving rendition. Most impressive were
the Stanford Chorus and Choir. The altos
were heavenly, as the text demands, and
while the men provided a solid harmonic
base, the sopranos reached the heights of
| feeling.

Debussy's popular sketches —
"Clouds," "Festival," and "Sirens" —
failed to convey the unique impressionist
spirit of a Monet painting. When
"Clouds" began poorly, Starr became ag
gressive and pushed the tempo, ruining
the relaxed atmosphere. "Festival" went
better but "Sirens" was a disappoint
ment. The chorus and orchestra were not
well-integrated and, while the in
strumentalists failed to achieve the ir
idescent warmth of Debussy, the women
singers were consistently too loud. When
I hear "Sirens," 1 imagine the voices of
Homer's maidens floating over the water
— misty yet real — an effect which de
mands quiet intensity. Despite their
beautiful tone, the women did not
achieve this.
Mahler's secular cantata, Das Klagende
Lied (Song of Sorrow), is a work which
one often hears about but rarely gets a
chance to hear in concert.
The first half, entitled "The Minstrel,"
was flat and sloppy. Starr's tempos were
erratic, occasionally too fast, and the or
chestra lacked spirit. Only the Chorus and
Choir, though obviously pushed to their
technical limits, came through with an
inspired performance.
