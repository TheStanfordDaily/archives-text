## lonnie rosenwald The 						latest from Emerson, Lake and Palmer, The Band 
### 
Moody Blues guitarist Justin
Hayward's latest effort, Songwri
ter, is another in the growing list
of independent works by mem
bers of some of rock's estab
lished bands. After his last re
lease, Blue fays, Hayward has
come up with a disappointing
set.
The first eight songs, some
about isolation, others about
love, are plagued by overly sim
ple and redundant orchestra
tions as well as lackluster, tinny
background vocals.
Only the last two numbers, -
"Doin' Time" and "Nos
tradamus," have any redeeming
quality; Hayward returns in
these to the familiar and success
ful Moody Blues sound.
Hayward is capable of fine
work as evidenced by his past
showings. But, for a quality in
vestment, better to stick with the
Moody Blues of old, or perhaps
the new disc which they are re
ported to be cutting right now.

(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Emerson, Lake and Palmer
have also come up with an entry
to the individual work market.
Works Volume 1. Works is a two
record set giving one side to each
of the performers, and a final
side featuring the whole group.
Keith Emerson's side, entitled
"Piano Concerto Number One,"
reflects his early training in both
jazz and classical music. Per
formed with the London
Philharmonic Orchestra, the
piece ranges from quiet easy
moods to a Leonard Bernstein/
West Side Story type of vivacity
with, of course, an accent on
Emerson's astounding piano
work.
Greg Lake's compositions, five
in all, comprise most of the voc
alizations on the album. All of
these songs are easily on a par
with his previous pieces, and
some are better.

Drummer Carl Palmer comes
up with a classical-jazz ex
travaganza for his side. He be
gins with a selection from Pro
kofieff's The Scythian Suite,
moves into two quick-tempoed
pieces, "L.A. Nights" and "New
Orleans" (watch for Joe Walsh's
guitar work on the former), then
a quieter Bach composition, and
finally, a big-hand beat with
"Food For Your Soul" and
"Tank." The latter, a reprise
from ELP's first album, has, in
this version, horns replacing
Emerson's familiar synthesizer
in the old piece. With Palmer on
drums, Emerson on piano, this
piece rivals any work by Chicago
or Blood, Sweat, and Tears.
The last side features two cuts.
The first, an Aaron Copland
piece called "Fanfare for the
Common Man," begins as a
majestic fanfare fit for any royal
reception, and soon dissolves
into the ELP of old, highlighted
by Emerson's keyboard work.
The last piece, "Pirates," is
perhaps the best track of all.
Composed by Emerson, Lake
and Peter Sinfield (who has
helped with the group's lyric
writing in the past), this piece is a
tribute to the bawdy, adventur
ous life of pirates sacking the
Caribbean. ELP, supplemented
by the Orchestra de 1 'Opera de
Paris conducted by Godfrey
Salmon, conjure up an exuber
ant portrayal of reckless, daring
days of old.
As the "Volume I" in the title
suggests, there are more
"Works" to come, scheduled for
release in October. Overall,

Works Volume I stands as a piece
which may be enjoyed by those
who have come to appreciate
Emerson, Lake and Palmer in the
past, as well as those who have
complained of too much use of
synthesizers and too much simi
larity in sound of the older
works.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Jesse Colin Young likes to as
semble a group of musicians and
friends and get everyone to
gether out at a beach in Northern
California to play some music,
spread around a little love, and
incidentally record the results.
Or so he would have you be
lieve.
The opening cut of Love on the
Wing presents the image Young
wants to assume:
"Living on the highway/ It is
not exactly my cup of tea/ 'Cause
I'm a family man."
Self-deprecating, hard
working, humble lover, father

and friend is Young. But he's
also an excellent singer, song
writer and guitarist, as this
album once again proves.
LikeSongFor Juli, Love on the
Wing is spruced up with brass,
but the flute is missing.
Nevertheless, Young's charm
and good feeling come through
clearly on the album and it is
certainly a satisfying purchase.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Islands, The Band's last group
effort, following their final tour
last fall, is not a farewell epic.
Their usual blues-rock music
with a heavy dose of horns
doesn't seem to make its mark as
either innovation or nostalgia.
Robbie Robertson's lyrics are un
inspired.
A few cuts are pleasing â€”
"Ain't That a Lot of Love" is an
example of the Band's best old
music drawing on the tradition
of spiritualism and deep-

Southern blues. But the mood is
soon broken by the tune which
follows, "Christmas Must Be To
night," a populist interpretation
of the birth of Jesus.
The title cut starts out the sec
ond side with a lovely instru
mental number suggesting the
feeling of an island paradise. But
once again we are rudely jolted
off the beach by "The Saga of
Peyote Rouge," a cowgirl ballad
which is one of the better, if un
exciting, songs on the album.
Several members of Tne Band
have signed contracts for solo
recording, so perhaps what is
missing on Islands will reappear
in these future efforts.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Half of the songs on Music
magic, the latest release by Re
turn to Forever, are arranged and
composed by Chick Corea, the
group's former leader. In a de

parture from most of their former
work, the artful jazz is laced with
vocals by Gayle Moran, Corea
and bassist Stanley Clark.
Moran's voice is outstanding,
although the lyrics she is given
to work with are uniformly
simplistic. "So hello, my
friend/Good to see you again I
You've been gone for awhile/
Now you're back and I'm so glad
that you're here," etc.
All the musicians make out
standing contributions, both as
soloists and as a blend. But
Corea's accoustic piano and de
xterity on the moog, and Joe Par
rel 1 on saxophone stand out as
particularly skillful.
The music is an innovative
potpourri of electric jazz and
horn arrangements. But the
sound is less mystical, more
conservative than previously,
perhaps because the vocals in
hibit it. The cuts "Hello Again"
and "Musicmagic" feature a
musical dialogue between Corea
and Moran.
Corea notes on the album jac
ket that the album is "musical
fun with no barriers of musical
style or type of audience."
Perhaps the group's shift, like
the change in George Benson's
style, is aimed at broadening the
group's appeal.
Those who have admired Re
turn to Forever's improvisation
and experimental jazz will be
disappointed at what seems a re
gressive work. Those who prefer
softer jazz and especially vocals
will enjoy Musicmagic.

work as evidenced by his past
showings. But, for a quality in
vestment, better to stick with the
Moody Blues of old, or perhaps
the new disc which they are re
ported to be cutting right now.

(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Emerson, Lake and Palmer
have also come up with an entry
to the individual work market.
Works Volume 1. Works is a two
record set giving one side to each
of the performers, and a final
side featuring the whole group.
Keith Emerson's side, entitled
"Piano Concerto Number One,"
reflects his early training in both
jazz and classical music. Per
formed with the London
Philharmonic Orchestra, the
piece ranges from quiet easy
moods to a Leonard Bernstein/
West Side Story type of vivacity
with, of course, an accent on
Emerson's astounding piano
work.
Greg Lake's compositions, five
in all, comprise most of the voc
alizations on the album. All of
these songs are easily on a par
with his previous pieces, and
some are better.

Drummer Carl Palmer comes
up with a classical-jazz ex
travaganza for his side. He be
gins with a selection from Pro
kofieff's The Scythian Suite,
moves into two quick-tempoed
pieces, "L.A. Nights" and "New
Orleans" (watch for Joe Walsh's
guitar work on the former), then
a quieter Bach composition, and
finally, a big-hand beat with
"Food For Your Soul" and
"Tank." The latter, a reprise
from ELP's first album, has, in
this version, horns replacing
Emerson's familiar synthesizer
in the old piece. With Palmer on
drums, Emerson on piano, this
piece rivals any work by Chicago
or Blood, Sweat, and Tears.
The last side features two cuts.
The first, an Aaron Copland
piece called "Fanfare for the
Common Man," begins as a
majestic fanfare fit for any royal
reception, and soon dissolves
into the ELP of old, highlighted
by Emerson's keyboard work.
The last piece, "Pirates," is
perhaps the best track of all.
Composed by Emerson, Lake
and Peter Sinfield (who has
helped with the group's lyric
writing in the past), this piece is a
tribute to the bawdy, adventur
ous life of pirates sacking the
Caribbean. ELP, supplemented
by the Orchestra de 1 'Opera de
Paris conducted by Godfrey
Salmon, conjure up an exuber
ant portrayal of reckless, daring
days of old.
As the "Volume I" in the title
suggests, there are more
"Works" to come, scheduled for
release in October. Overall,

Works Volume I stands as a piece
which may be enjoyed by those
who have come to appreciate
Emerson, Lake and Palmer in the
past, as well as those who have
complained of too much use of
synthesizers and too much simi
larity in sound of the older
works.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Jesse Colin Young likes to as
semble a group of musicians and
friends and get everyone to
gether out at a beach in Northern
California to play some music,
spread around a little love, and
incidentally record the results.
Or so he would have you be
lieve.
The opening cut of Love on the
Wing presents the image Young
wants to assume:
"Living on the highway/ It is
not exactly my cup of tea/ 'Cause
I'm a family man."
Self-deprecating, hard
working, humble lover, father

and friend is Young. But he's
also an excellent singer, song
writer and guitarist, as this
album once again proves.
LikeSongFor Juli, Love on the
Wing is spruced up with brass,
but the flute is missing.
Nevertheless, Young's charm
and good feeling come through
clearly on the album and it is
certainly a satisfying purchase.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Islands, The Band's last group
effort, following their final tour
last fall, is not a farewell epic.
Their usual blues-rock music
with a heavy dose of horns
doesn't seem to make its mark as
either innovation or nostalgia.
Robbie Robertson's lyrics are un
inspired.
A few cuts are pleasing â€”
"Ain't That a Lot of Love" is an
example of the Band's best old
music drawing on the tradition
of spiritualism and deep-

Southern blues. But the mood is
soon broken by the tune which
follows, "Christmas Must Be To
night," a populist interpretation
of the birth of Jesus.
The title cut starts out the sec
ond side with a lovely instru
mental number suggesting the
feeling of an island paradise. But
once again we are rudely jolted
off the beach by "The Saga of
Peyote Rouge," a cowgirl ballad
which is one of the better, if un
exciting, songs on the album.
Several members of Tne Band
have signed contracts for solo
recording, so perhaps what is
missing on Islands will reappear
in these future efforts.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Half of the songs on Music
magic, the latest release by Re
turn to Forever, are arranged and
composed by Chick Corea, the
group's former leader. In a de

parture from most of their former
work, the artful jazz is laced with
vocals by Gayle Moran, Corea
and bassist Stanley Clark.
Moran's voice is outstanding,
although the lyrics she is given
to work with are uniformly
simplistic. "So hello, my
friend/Good to see you again I
You've been gone for awhile/
Now you're back and I'm so glad
that you're here," etc.
All the musicians make out
standing contributions, both as
soloists and as a blend. But
Corea's accoustic piano and de
xterity on the moog, and Joe Par
rel 1 on saxophone stand out as
particularly skillful.
The music is an innovative
potpourri of electric jazz and
horn arrangements. But the
sound is less mystical, more
conservative than previously,
perhaps because the vocals in
hibit it. The cuts "Hello Again"
and "Musicmagic" feature a
musical dialogue between Corea
and Moran.
Corea notes on the album jac
ket that the album is "musical
fun with no barriers of musical
style or type of audience."
Perhaps the group's shift, like
the change in George Benson's
style, is aimed at broadening the
group's appeal.
Those who have admired Re
turn to Forever's improvisation
and experimental jazz will be
disappointed at what seems a re
gressive work. Those who prefer
softer jazz and especially vocals
will enjoy Musicmagic.

with, of course, an accent on
Emerson's astounding piano
work.
Greg Lake's compositions, five
in all, comprise most of the voc
alizations on the album. All of
these songs are easily on a par
with his previous pieces, and
some are better.

Drummer Carl Palmer comes
up with a classical-jazz ex
travaganza for his side. He be
gins with a selection from Pro
kofieff's The Scythian Suite,
moves into two quick-tempoed
pieces, "L.A. Nights" and "New
Orleans" (watch for Joe Walsh's
guitar work on the former), then
a quieter Bach composition, and
finally, a big-hand beat with
"Food For Your Soul" and
"Tank." The latter, a reprise
from ELP's first album, has, in
this version, horns replacing
Emerson's familiar synthesizer
in the old piece. With Palmer on
drums, Emerson on piano, this
piece rivals any work by Chicago
or Blood, Sweat, and Tears.
The last side features two cuts.
The first, an Aaron Copland
piece called "Fanfare for the
Common Man," begins as a
majestic fanfare fit for any royal
reception, and soon dissolves
into the ELP of old, highlighted
by Emerson's keyboard work.
The last piece, "Pirates," is
perhaps the best track of all.
Composed by Emerson, Lake
and Peter Sinfield (who has
helped with the group's lyric
writing in the past), this piece is a
tribute to the bawdy, adventur
ous life of pirates sacking the
Caribbean. ELP, supplemented
by the Orchestra de 1 'Opera de
Paris conducted by Godfrey
Salmon, conjure up an exuber
ant portrayal of reckless, daring
days of old.
As the "Volume I" in the title
suggests, there are more
"Works" to come, scheduled for
release in October. Overall,

Works Volume I stands as a piece
which may be enjoyed by those
who have come to appreciate
Emerson, Lake and Palmer in the
past, as well as those who have
complained of too much use of
synthesizers and too much simi
larity in sound of the older
works.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Jesse Colin Young likes to as
semble a group of musicians and
friends and get everyone to
gether out at a beach in Northern
California to play some music,
spread around a little love, and
incidentally record the results.
Or so he would have you be
lieve.
The opening cut of Love on the
Wing presents the image Young
wants to assume:
"Living on the highway/ It is
not exactly my cup of tea/ 'Cause
I'm a family man."
Self-deprecating, hard
working, humble lover, father

and friend is Young. But he's
also an excellent singer, song
writer and guitarist, as this
album once again proves.
LikeSongFor Juli, Love on the
Wing is spruced up with brass,
but the flute is missing.
Nevertheless, Young's charm
and good feeling come through
clearly on the album and it is
certainly a satisfying purchase.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Islands, The Band's last group
effort, following their final tour
last fall, is not a farewell epic.
Their usual blues-rock music
with a heavy dose of horns
doesn't seem to make its mark as
either innovation or nostalgia.
Robbie Robertson's lyrics are un
inspired.
A few cuts are pleasing â€”
"Ain't That a Lot of Love" is an
example of the Band's best old
music drawing on the tradition
of spiritualism and deep-

Southern blues. But the mood is
soon broken by the tune which
follows, "Christmas Must Be To
night," a populist interpretation
of the birth of Jesus.
The title cut starts out the sec
ond side with a lovely instru
mental number suggesting the
feeling of an island paradise. But
once again we are rudely jolted
off the beach by "The Saga of
Peyote Rouge," a cowgirl ballad
which is one of the better, if un
exciting, songs on the album.
Several members of Tne Band
have signed contracts for solo
recording, so perhaps what is
missing on Islands will reappear
in these future efforts.
(This record is available at the
Stanford Bookstore.)

Half of the songs on Music
magic, the latest release by Re
turn to Forever, are arranged and
composed by Chick Corea, the
group's former leader. In a de

parture from most of their former
work, the artful jazz is laced with
vocals by Gayle Moran, Corea
and bassist Stanley Clark.
Moran's voice is outstanding,
although the lyrics she is given
to work with are uniformly
simplistic. "So hello, my
friend/Good to see you again I
You've been gone for awhile/
Now you're back and I'm so glad
that you're here," etc.
All the musicians make out
standing contributions, both as
soloists and as a blend. But
Corea's accoustic piano and de
xterity on the moog, and Joe Par
rel 1 on saxophone stand out as
particularly skillful.
The music is an innovative
potpourri of electric jazz and
horn arrangements. But the
sound is less mystical, more
conservative than previously,
perhaps because the vocals in
hibit it. The cuts "Hello Again"
and "Musicmagic" feature a
musical dialogue between Corea
and Moran.
Corea notes on the album jac
ket that the album is "musical
fun with no barriers of musical
style or type of audience."
Perhaps the group's shift, like
the change in George Benson's
style, is aimed at broadening the
group's appeal.
Those who have admired Re
turn to Forever's improvisation
and experimental jazz will be
disappointed at what seems a re
gressive work. Those who prefer
softer jazz and especially vocals
will enjoy Musicmagic.

Moody Blues guitarist Justin
Hayward's latest effort, Songwri
ter, is another in the growing list
of independent works by mem
bers of some of rock's estab

lease, Blue fays, Hayward has
come up with a disappointing
set.
The first eight songs, some
about isolation, others about
love, are plagued by overly sim
ple and redundant orchestra
tions as well as lackluster, tinny
background vocals.
Only the last two numbers, -
"Doin' Time" and "Nos
tradamus," have any redeeming
quality; Hayward returns in
these to the familiar and success

Hayward is capable of fine
work as evidenced by his past

Moody Blues of old, or perhaps
the new disc which they are re

"Tank." The latter, a reprise
from ELP's first album, has, in
this version, horns replacing
Emerson's familiar synthesizer
in the old piece. With Palmer on
drums, Emerson on piano, this
piece rivals any work by Chicago
or Blood, Sweat, and Tears.
The last side features two cuts.
The first, an Aaron Copland
piece called "Fanfare for the
Common Man," begins as a
majestic fanfare fit for any royal
reception, and soon dissolves
into the ELP of old, highlighted
by Emerson's keyboard work.
The last piece, "Pirates," is
perhaps the best track of all.
Composed by Emerson, Lake
and Peter Sinfield (who has
helped with the group's lyric
writing in the past), this piece is a
tribute to the bawdy, adventur
ous life of pirates sacking the
Caribbean. ELP, supplemented
by the Orchestra de 1 'Opera de
Paris conducted by Godfrey
Salmon, conjure up an exuber
ant portrayal of reckless, daring
days of old.
As the "Volume I" in the title
suggests, there are more
"Works" to come, scheduled for
release in October. Overall,

Works Volume I stands as a piece
which may be enjoyed by those
who have come to appreciate
Emerson, Lake and Palmer in the
past, as well as those who have
complained of too much use of
synthesizers and too much simi
larity in sound of the older
works.

Jesse Colin Young likes to as
semble a group of musicians and
friends and get everyone to
gether out at a beach in Northern
California to play some music,
spread around a little love, and
incidentally record the results.
Or so he would have you be
lieve.
The opening cut of Love on the
Wing presents the image Young
wants to assume:
"Living on the highway/ It is
not exactly my cup of tea/ 'Cause
I'm a family man."
Self-deprecating, hard
working, humble lover, father

and friend is Young. But he's
also an excellent singer, song
writer and guitarist, as this
album once again proves.
LikeSongFor Juli, Love on the
Wing is spruced up with brass,
but the flute is missing.
Nevertheless, Young's charm
and good feeling come through
clearly on the album and it is
certainly a satisfying purchase.

Islands, The Band's last group
effort, following their final tour
last fall, is not a farewell epic.
Their usual blues-rock music
with a heavy dose of horns
doesn't seem to make its mark as
either innovation or nostalgia.
Robbie Robertson's lyrics are un
inspired.
A few cuts are pleasing â€”
"Ain't That a Lot of Love" is an
example of the Band's best old
music drawing on the tradition
of spiritualism and deep-

Southern blues. But the mood is
soon broken by the tune which
follows, "Christmas Must Be To
night," a populist interpretation
of the birth of Jesus.
The title cut starts out the sec
ond side with a lovely instru
mental number suggesting the
feeling of an island paradise. But
once again we are rudely jolted
off the beach by "The Saga of
Peyote Rouge," a cowgirl ballad
which is one of the better, if un
exciting, songs on the album.
Several members of Tne Band
have signed contracts for solo
recording, so perhaps what is
missing on Islands will reappear
in these future efforts.

Half of the songs on Music
magic, the latest release by Re
turn to Forever, are arranged and
composed by Chick Corea, the
group's former leader. In a de

parture from most of their former
work, the artful jazz is laced with
vocals by Gayle Moran, Corea
and bassist Stanley Clark.
Moran's voice is outstanding,
although the lyrics she is given
to work with are uniformly
simplistic. "So hello, my
friend/Good to see you again I
You've been gone for awhile/
Now you're back and I'm so glad
that you're here," etc.
All the musicians make out
standing contributions, both as
soloists and as a blend. But
Corea's accoustic piano and de
xterity on the moog, and Joe Par
rel 1 on saxophone stand out as
particularly skillful.
The music is an innovative
potpourri of electric jazz and
horn arrangements. But the
sound is less mystical, more
conservative than previously,
perhaps because the vocals in
hibit it. The cuts "Hello Again"
and "Musicmagic" feature a
musical dialogue between Corea
and Moran.
Corea notes on the album jac
ket that the album is "musical
fun with no barriers of musical
style or type of audience."
Perhaps the group's shift, like
the change in George Benson's
style, is aimed at broadening the
group's appeal.
Those who have admired Re
turn to Forever's improvisation
and experimental jazz will be
disappointed at what seems a re
gressive work. Those who prefer
softer jazz and especially vocals
will enjoy Musicmagic.
