Mozambican town seized
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesian comman
dos on a search-and-destroy mission have seized
a town 60 miles inside neighboring Mozambique
and intend to hold it until they have routed all
black guerrillas from the area, military comman
ders said yesterday.
At a briefing for reporters, the commanders
said their troops had met "practically no resis
tance," apparently because most guerrillas fled
or were already in Rhodesia.
Gen. Peter Walls, the commander of the com
bined forces, said the raid had effectively "dis
rupted" operations by Robert Mugabe's Zim
babwe National Liberation Army (ZANLA) into
Southeastern Rhodesia.
Military sources said the operation was
launched to destroy a network of camps from
which guerrillas were preparing a "major offen

sive" into Southeastern Rhodesia.
"Troops will be withdrawn from Mozambique
as soon as they complete their task of eliminat
ing...terrorists from the area in question and tie
stroying or removing arms, ammunition or
equipment dumps or caches," a Rhodesian milit
ary spokesman said.
British Foreign Secretary David Owen, in Paris
for an economic conference, said the incursion
"could well trigger off a serious military conflict
in the area. "He said he was deeply concerned not
only that Rhodesian forces crossed into Mozam
bique "but have announced they intend to stay
inside Mozambique."
Policemen killed at Hayward State
Hayward — A disagreement between two
California State University at Hayward police
men over checking out a burglar alarm erupted
into gunfire, leaving two officers dead.
Sgt. Stanley Henney, 41, and patrolman Gary
Hart, 25, were killed in the Monday night inci
dent. Henney died instantly of head and chest
wounds and Hart died two hours later of a bullet
in the head.
Patrolman Fred Moreno, 39, was booked for
investigation of two murder charges.
Hayward Police Capt. George Kelly said
Moreno had refused to discuss the shootings.
Kelly said Moreno had returned from checking
out the burglar alarm and expressed irritation at
the failure of other officers to help him.
He said there was "some physical contact" be
tween Moreno and Henney and that Hart had
attempted to intervene in the dispute when the
shooting started.
Kelly said a woman dispatcher, Laura Bartoni,
28, saw the incident but escaped unharmed.
Carter sends best wishes to Castro
Plains, Ga. — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that he sent a personal message to Cuban
President Fidel Castro expressing best wishes for
successful negotiations to restore diplomatic re
lations and Castro responded in kind.
"1 think we moved some first, faltering steps,"
Carter told reporters before setting out on a sen
timental stroll through his home town. "But it

eventually depends on them. We'll move as fast
as they will."
He said he did not communicate directly with
Castro.
But through intermediaries we have com
municated," Carter said. "I sent him best wishes
for a successful conclusion of our negotiations
and he responded accordingly."
The State Department has confirmed that the
United States has proposed a limited exchange of
diplomats with Cuba.
Ford knocks Carter plan for Cuba
San Francisco — Former President Gerald
Ford said yesterday he has "grave reservations"
about President Jimmy Carter's hints of better
relations with Cuba.
"There are Cuban troops still in Angola," Ford
said in his brief comment while walking to a
luncheon. He did not elaborate and news repor
ters had no further access to Ford.
While president, Ford had cited the Angolan
civil war and Cuba's alleged participation in it as
a deterrent to improved relations between the
United States and Cuba.
The former president was in San Francisco to
speak to 20 fellows of the Eisenhower Exchange
Fellowships. Ford recently assumed the largely
ceremonial position of president of the fellow
ships.
Terrorists ask for mediator
Assen, The Netherlands — South Moluccan
terrorists holding at least 55 hostages on a
hijacked train for the past nine days asked for
outside mediators yesterday, a request that some
here saw as a first step toward possible resolution
of the long standoff.
Prime Minister Joop den Uyl met through the
afternoon with key ministers in the Dutch capital
of The Hague to consider the request.
A highly placed government source cautioned
against too much optimism over the gunmen's
call for mediators, calling it "a small change."
But it appeared to open the way for genuine
negotiaitons, which government officials said
had not been possible previously.
Seven to 10 terrorists, members of the South

Moluccans immigrant community in the Nether
lands, were holding the hostages on the com
mandeered passenger train on a rail line eight
miles from here.
Another group of four gunmen was holding
four teachers in an elementary school in the vil
lage of Bovensmilde, just south of Assen.
South Moluccan mediators were instrumental
in ending a similar twin seige in December 1975,
when South Moluccan militants seized a train
and the Indonesia consulate in Amsterdam to
demand Dutch help in winning independence
from Indonesia for their island homeland.
Russian satellite-killer fails new test
Washington — The Pentagon confirmed yes
terday that the Russians failed in a new flight test
of their satellite-destroying system.
It said information on the orbits of a Soviet
target satellite and a hunter satellite sent aloft
from central Russia "woultj indicate a failure to
accomplish a close approach and, therefore, fai
lure to intercept."
A U.S. project leading toward a possible
satellite-killing is believed to be at least three
years away from its first flight test.
The United States has become increasingly
concerned about Soviet objectives in this field
since the Russians resumed anti-satellite testing
last year after a lapse of four years.
After the apparent Soviet failure to achieve a
close approach by the hunter satellite, the Penta
gon said, the hunter satellite fell out of orbit into
the Pacific while the target satellite remains in
tact in space.
Some officials believe t he Russians may make a
second attempt at an intercept of the same target
satellite.

Ford knocks Carter plan for Cuba
San Francisco — Former President Gerald

Terrorists ask for mediator
Assen, The Netherlands — South Moluccan
terrorists holding at least 55 hostages on a
hijacked train for the past nine days asked for
outside mediators yesterday, a request that some
here saw as a first step toward possible resolution
of the long standoff.
Prime Minister Joop den Uyl met through the
afternoon with key ministers in the Dutch capital
of The Hague to consider the request.
A highly placed government source cautioned
against too much optimism over the gunmen's
call for mediators, calling it "a small change."
But it appeared to open the way for genuine
negotiaitons, which government officials said
had not been possible previously.
Seven to 10 terrorists, members of the South

Moluccans immigrant community in the Nether
lands, were holding the hostages on the com
mandeered passenger train on a rail line eight
miles from here.
Another group of four gunmen was holding
four teachers in an elementary school in the vil
lage of Bovensmilde, just south of Assen.
South Moluccan mediators were instrumental
in ending a similar twin seige in December 1975,
when South Moluccan militants seized a train
and the Indonesia consulate in Amsterdam to
demand Dutch help in winning independence
from Indonesia for their island homeland.
Russian satellite-killer fails new test
Washington — The Pentagon confirmed yes
terday that the Russians failed in a new flight test
of their satellite-destroying system.
It said information on the orbits of a Soviet
target satellite and a hunter satellite sent aloft
from central Russia "woultj indicate a failure to
accomplish a close approach and, therefore, fai
lure to intercept."
A U.S. project leading toward a possible
satellite-killing is believed to be at least three
years away from its first flight test.
The United States has become increasingly
concerned about Soviet objectives in this field
since the Russians resumed anti-satellite testing
last year after a lapse of four years.
After the apparent Soviet failure to achieve a
close approach by the hunter satellite, the Penta
gon said, the hunter satellite fell out of orbit into
the Pacific while the target satellite remains in
tact in space.
Some officials believe t he Russians may make a
second attempt at an intercept of the same target
satellite.

Mozambican town seized
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesian comman
dos on a search-and-destroy mission have seized
a town 60 miles inside neighboring Mozambique
and intend to hold it until they have routed all
black guerrillas from the area, military comman
ders said yesterday.
At a briefing for reporters, the commanders
said their troops had met "practically no resis
tance," apparently because most guerrillas fled
or were already in Rhodesia.
Gen. Peter Walls, the commander of the com
bined forces, said the raid had effectively "dis
rupted" operations by Robert Mugabe's Zim
babwe National Liberation Army (ZANLA) into
Southeastern Rhodesia.
Military sources said the operation was
launched to destroy a network of camps from
which guerrillas were preparing a "major offen

sive" into Southeastern Rhodesia.
"Troops will be withdrawn from Mozambique
as soon as they complete their task of eliminat
ing...terrorists from the area in question and tie
stroying or removing arms, ammunition or
equipment dumps or caches," a Rhodesian milit

British Foreign Secretary David Owen, in Paris

"could well trigger off a serious military conflict

Ford knocks Carter plan for Cuba
San Francisco — Former President Gerald
Ford said yesterday he has "grave reservations"
about President Jimmy Carter's hints of better
relations with Cuba.
"There are Cuban troops still in Angola," Ford
said in his brief comment while walking to a
luncheon. He did not elaborate and news repor
ters had no further access to Ford.
While president, Ford had cited the Angolan
civil war and Cuba's alleged participation in it as
a deterrent to improved relations between the
United States and Cuba.
The former president was in San Francisco to
speak to 20 fellows of the Eisenhower Exchange
Fellowships. Ford recently assumed the largely
ceremonial position of president of the fellow
ships.
Terrorists ask for mediator
Assen, The Netherlands — South Moluccan
terrorists holding at least 55 hostages on a
hijacked train for the past nine days asked for
outside mediators yesterday, a request that some
here saw as a first step toward possible resolution
of the long standoff.
Prime Minister Joop den Uyl met through the
afternoon with key ministers in the Dutch capital
of The Hague to consider the request.
A highly placed government source cautioned
against too much optimism over the gunmen's
call for mediators, calling it "a small change."
But it appeared to open the way for genuine
negotiaitons, which government officials said
had not been possible previously.
Seven to 10 terrorists, members of the South

Moluccans immigrant community in the Nether
lands, were holding the hostages on the com
mandeered passenger train on a rail line eight
miles from here.
Another group of four gunmen was holding
four teachers in an elementary school in the vil
lage of Bovensmilde, just south of Assen.
South Moluccan mediators were instrumental
in ending a similar twin seige in December 1975,
when South Moluccan militants seized a train
and the Indonesia consulate in Amsterdam to
demand Dutch help in winning independence
from Indonesia for their island homeland.
Russian satellite-killer fails new test
Washington — The Pentagon confirmed yes
terday that the Russians failed in a new flight test
of their satellite-destroying system.
It said information on the orbits of a Soviet
target satellite and a hunter satellite sent aloft
from central Russia "woultj indicate a failure to
accomplish a close approach and, therefore, fai
lure to intercept."
A U.S. project leading toward a possible
satellite-killing is believed to be at least three
years away from its first flight test.
The United States has become increasingly
concerned about Soviet objectives in this field
since the Russians resumed anti-satellite testing
last year after a lapse of four years.
After the apparent Soviet failure to achieve a
close approach by the hunter satellite, the Penta
gon said, the hunter satellite fell out of orbit into
the Pacific while the target satellite remains in
tact in space.
Some officials believe t he Russians may make a
second attempt at an intercept of the same target
satellite.

Mozambican town seized
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Rhodesian comman
dos on a search-and-destroy mission have seized
a town 60 miles inside neighboring Mozambique
and intend to hold it until they have routed all
black guerrillas from the area, military comman
ders said yesterday.
At a briefing for reporters, the commanders
said their troops had met "practically no resis
tance," apparently because most guerrillas fled
or were already in Rhodesia.
Gen. Peter Walls, the commander of the com
bined forces, said the raid had effectively "dis
rupted" operations by Robert Mugabe's Zim
babwe National Liberation Army (ZANLA) into
Southeastern Rhodesia.
Military sources said the operation was
launched to destroy a network of camps from
which guerrillas were preparing a "major offen

sive" into Southeastern Rhodesia.
"Troops will be withdrawn from Mozambique
as soon as they complete their task of eliminat
ing...terrorists from the area in question and tie
stroying or removing arms, ammunition or
equipment dumps or caches," a Rhodesian milit
ary spokesman said.
British Foreign Secretary David Owen, in Paris
for an economic conference, said the incursion
"could well trigger off a serious military conflict
in the area. "He said he was deeply concerned not
only that Rhodesian forces crossed into Mozam
bique "but have announced they intend to stay
inside Mozambique."
