# Until divestment
## The 						Stanford Daily Seniors asked to withhold gifts 
### Jim Tranquada 
Graduating seniors are being askea
to sign a petition pledging not to con
tribute to the Stanford endowment
fund until the University divests itself
of all South African investments.
Petitions are being circulated by the
Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP) in an effort
"to impress on the University that
we're not going to give up the cam
paign for divestment because people
are graduating," according to Stuart
Ozer, SCRIP member.
The University endowment is com
posed of funds donated to the Univer
sity, according to Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president of public affairs.
Only the interest on the money is
invested, with the principal remaining
untouched. Purposes toward which
the money is applied can be restricted,
Rosenzweig said, and not all invest
ments are made in stocks.
The action of SCRIP "may be a little

premature," coming before the trus
tees' release a cost/benefit analysis of
divestiture in October, said Bill Stone,
new director of the Alumni Associa
tion.
"The information in the report may
bear on the graduates' decision,"
Stone said.
He called SCRIP'S action "not very
helpful."
White armbands and mortarboard
placards will also be made available to
seniors prior to commencement, Ozer
said.
In a continuing effort to establish
"substantial consensus" concerning
University investment policy, over
200 faculty members have signed a
petition asking trustees to support
shareholder proxies calling for nonex
pansion or withdrawal of U.S. corpora
tions in South Africa, according to
French Prof. Raymond Giraud,
member of the Faculty Committee
Supporting SCRIP.

The petition, put forward by Assoc.
Political Science Prof. Robert keohane
(in a May 23 Daily column), also calls
for trustees t<3 "consider the recon
stitution of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) in order
that it may more fully reflect the diver
sity of the University community."
"We are tremendously impressed
that we could mobilize about one-fifth
of the faculty here," Giraud said.
Petitions are still coming in, he said.
South Africa Catalyst Project, an in
dependent student group, has begun
seeking funding to achieve its "ulti
mate goal of U.S. corporate with
drawal from South Africa . . . through
education and organizing on Califor
nia college campuses," according to a
funding request being sent to various
non-University groups.
Over the summer
The project hopes to enable four
goals over the summer, according to
Larry Litvak, project member:
—to write a definitive study of U.S.
corporate presence in South Africa,
including the significance of Univer-,
sity investment;
—to write an organizer's handbook,
containing the "nuts and bolts" of or
ganizing;
—to organize a statewide conference
in mid-October, in conjunction with
Campuses United Against Apartheid
(CUAA), and
—to send "travelers" out in the fall
to help catalyze activity at various
campuses in California.
"We feel that Stanford is not un
ique," the project's funding request
says, citing recent protest actions here.
"This process can happen at other
campuses and we can help it happen."
Meanwhile, action aimed at univer
sity investments continue on other
campuses.
Two-day referendum
University of Oregon students voted
overwhelmingly against university
investment in Southern Africa in a
special two day referendum vote last

week, according to the Oregon Daily
Emerald.
One ballot measure, passed 980 to
180, called for the State Board of
Higher Education and the university's
Development Fund to divest them
selves of all stock and other holdings
in corporations with investments in
Southern Africa, the Emerald said.
The University of Oregon has mil 1-
ions of dollars" worth of stock in 27
corporations doing business in South
ern Africa, the Emerald reported.
The other measure, passed 903 to
257, stated recruiters from corpora
tions with investments in Southern
Africa should not be permitted to use
U. of Oregon facilities for recruitment
purposes.
Petition drive
The referendum is the result of a pet
ition drive organized by the Southern
Africa Support Committee (SASC), in
response to Oregon State System
Chancellor Ray Lievallen's charge that
SASC's demands do not reflect the
views of the majority of the student
body.
A similar referendum passed by a
five to one margin by the Associated
Students of the University of Califor
nia (ASUC) in mid-May.
The referendum called for eventual
divestment by the UC regents and de
manded formation of a committee to
advise the regents on issues of social
and moral responsibility related to
stock votes.
Further student actions are
scheduled for the end of this week,
including a torchlight procession to
night and teach-in on Friday at UC-
Berkeley, according to Andy Spahn,
statewide spokesman for CUAA.
CUAA and the Berkeley Third
World Coalition have demanded that
the university allow all faculty, staff
and students be given Friday after
noon off to attend a teach-in on South
Africa, minority admissions and the
Bakke decision, Spahn said.

ments are made in stocks.
The action of SCRIP "may be a little

premature," coming before the trus
tees' release a cost/benefit analysis of
divestiture in October, said Bill Stone,
new director of the Alumni Associa
tion.
"The information in the report may
bear on the graduates' decision,"
Stone said.
He called SCRIP'S action "not very
helpful."
White armbands and mortarboard
placards will also be made available to
seniors prior to commencement, Ozer
said.
In a continuing effort to establish
"substantial consensus" concerning
University investment policy, over
200 faculty members have signed a
petition asking trustees to support
shareholder proxies calling for nonex
pansion or withdrawal of U.S. corpora
tions in South Africa, according to
French Prof. Raymond Giraud,
member of the Faculty Committee
Supporting SCRIP.

The petition, put forward by Assoc.
Political Science Prof. Robert keohane
(in a May 23 Daily column), also calls
for trustees t<3 "consider the recon
stitution of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) in order
that it may more fully reflect the diver
sity of the University community."
"We are tremendously impressed
that we could mobilize about one-fifth
of the faculty here," Giraud said.
Petitions are still coming in, he said.
South Africa Catalyst Project, an in
dependent student group, has begun
seeking funding to achieve its "ulti
mate goal of U.S. corporate with
drawal from South Africa . . . through
education and organizing on Califor
nia college campuses," according to a
funding request being sent to various
non-University groups.
Over the summer
The project hopes to enable four
goals over the summer, according to
Larry Litvak, project member:
—to write a definitive study of U.S.
corporate presence in South Africa,
including the significance of Univer-,
sity investment;
—to write an organizer's handbook,
containing the "nuts and bolts" of or
ganizing;
—to organize a statewide conference
in mid-October, in conjunction with
Campuses United Against Apartheid
(CUAA), and
—to send "travelers" out in the fall
to help catalyze activity at various
campuses in California.
"We feel that Stanford is not un
ique," the project's funding request
says, citing recent protest actions here.
"This process can happen at other
campuses and we can help it happen."
Meanwhile, action aimed at univer
sity investments continue on other
campuses.
Two-day referendum
University of Oregon students voted
overwhelmingly against university
investment in Southern Africa in a
special two day referendum vote last

week, according to the Oregon Daily
Emerald.
One ballot measure, passed 980 to
180, called for the State Board of
Higher Education and the university's
Development Fund to divest them
selves of all stock and other holdings
in corporations with investments in
Southern Africa, the Emerald said.
The University of Oregon has mil 1-
ions of dollars" worth of stock in 27
corporations doing business in South
ern Africa, the Emerald reported.
The other measure, passed 903 to
257, stated recruiters from corpora
tions with investments in Southern
Africa should not be permitted to use
U. of Oregon facilities for recruitment
purposes.
Petition drive
The referendum is the result of a pet
ition drive organized by the Southern
Africa Support Committee (SASC), in
response to Oregon State System
Chancellor Ray Lievallen's charge that
SASC's demands do not reflect the
views of the majority of the student
body.
A similar referendum passed by a
five to one margin by the Associated
Students of the University of Califor
nia (ASUC) in mid-May.
The referendum called for eventual
divestment by the UC regents and de
manded formation of a committee to
advise the regents on issues of social
and moral responsibility related to
stock votes.
Further student actions are
scheduled for the end of this week,
including a torchlight procession to
night and teach-in on Friday at UC-
Berkeley, according to Andy Spahn,
statewide spokesman for CUAA.
CUAA and the Berkeley Third
World Coalition have demanded that
the university allow all faculty, staff
and students be given Friday after
noon off to attend a teach-in on South
Africa, minority admissions and the
Bakke decision, Spahn said.
Graduating seniors are being askea
to sign a petition pledging not to con
tribute to the Stanford endowment
fund until the University divests itself
of all South African investments.
Petitions are being circulated by the
Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP) in an effort
"to impress on the University that
we're not going to give up the cam
paign for divestment because people
are graduating," according to Stuart
Ozer, SCRIP member.
The University endowment is com
posed of funds donated to the Univer
sity, according to Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president of public affairs.
Only the interest on the money is
invested, with the principal remaining
untouched. Purposes toward which
the money is applied can be restricted,
Rosenzweig said, and not all invest
ments are made in stocks.

French Prof. Raymond Giraud,
member of the Faculty Committee
Supporting SCRIP.

The petition, put forward by Assoc.
Political Science Prof. Robert keohane
(in a May 23 Daily column), also calls
for trustees t<3 "consider the recon
stitution of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) in order
that it may more fully reflect the diver
sity of the University community."
"We are tremendously impressed
that we could mobilize about one-fifth
of the faculty here," Giraud said.
Petitions are still coming in, he said.
South Africa Catalyst Project, an in
dependent student group, has begun
seeking funding to achieve its "ulti
mate goal of U.S. corporate with
drawal from South Africa . . . through
education and organizing on Califor
nia college campuses," according to a
funding request being sent to various
non-University groups.
Over the summer
The project hopes to enable four
goals over the summer, according to
Larry Litvak, project member:
—to write a definitive study of U.S.
corporate presence in South Africa,
including the significance of Univer-,
sity investment;
—to write an organizer's handbook,
containing the "nuts and bolts" of or
ganizing;
—to organize a statewide conference
in mid-October, in conjunction with
Campuses United Against Apartheid
(CUAA), and
—to send "travelers" out in the fall
to help catalyze activity at various
campuses in California.
"We feel that Stanford is not un
ique," the project's funding request
says, citing recent protest actions here.
"This process can happen at other
campuses and we can help it happen."
Meanwhile, action aimed at univer
sity investments continue on other
campuses.
Two-day referendum
University of Oregon students voted
overwhelmingly against university
investment in Southern Africa in a
special two day referendum vote last

week, according to the Oregon Daily
Emerald.
One ballot measure, passed 980 to
180, called for the State Board of
Higher Education and the university's
Development Fund to divest them
selves of all stock and other holdings
in corporations with investments in
Southern Africa, the Emerald said.
The University of Oregon has mil 1-
ions of dollars" worth of stock in 27
corporations doing business in South
ern Africa, the Emerald reported.
The other measure, passed 903 to
257, stated recruiters from corpora
tions with investments in Southern
Africa should not be permitted to use
U. of Oregon facilities for recruitment
purposes.
Petition drive
The referendum is the result of a pet
ition drive organized by the Southern
Africa Support Committee (SASC), in
response to Oregon State System
Chancellor Ray Lievallen's charge that
SASC's demands do not reflect the
views of the majority of the student
body.
A similar referendum passed by a
five to one margin by the Associated
Students of the University of Califor
nia (ASUC) in mid-May.
The referendum called for eventual
divestment by the UC regents and de
manded formation of a committee to
advise the regents on issues of social
and moral responsibility related to
stock votes.
Further student actions are
scheduled for the end of this week,
including a torchlight procession to
night and teach-in on Friday at UC-
Berkeley, according to Andy Spahn,
statewide spokesman for CUAA.
CUAA and the Berkeley Third
World Coalition have demanded that
the university allow all faculty, staff
and students be given Friday after
noon off to attend a teach-in on South
Africa, minority admissions and the
Bakke decision, Spahn said.
