# Special problems of handicapped often not recognized, say students
##

"The disabled are often not a visible
segment of the student body and it's
pretty easy to pretend they have no
special needs," said Harold Boyd, as
sociate dean of student affairs.
This is a major problem, according
to Joann Callahan and Greg Fowler,
two blind graduate students who met
last Friday to discuss life here for the
blind.
The meeting was organized by
Harold Wolf, a freshman enrolled in a
SWOPSI course called "Experience
based approach and understanding of
mentally and physically handicap
ped." The get-together was one seg
ment of a five-part project studying

handicapped students.
The lack of a centralized program to
locate other blind students in the Uni
versity is another big problem, said
Callahan, a masters student in Latin
American studies and formerly a Har
vard undergraduate.
No rapport
"How can you help someone unless
you know who they are? Also, we are
not able to develop a rapport with fel
low blind students and that is terri
ble," she added.
Attempts to compile a list of blind
students have proven unsuccessful,
according to Callahan. Circulars were
distributed to the deans of each school
but there was a limited response, she

said. Cowell Health Center could pro
vide little help either, Callahan said.
Another problem for a blind student
is the constant necessity for readers,
Callahan added.
"Most people know we are blind and
realize that classes assign lots of read
ing, but no one puts two and two to
gether," she stated.
A-Phi-O is very helpful, she said,
both in making tapes and locating
readers.
"We need more support for A-Phi-
O's program and I see a favorable coali
tion between the dean of student af
fairs and A-Phi-O," she said.
Brochure
The administration is beginning
work on the problem and the office of
the dean of student affairs is making a
brochure listing services here for
handicapped students, according to
Boyd.
The University also has two opta
cons (optical tactical converter) avail
able for student use. This instrument
transfers printed characters to tactile
vibrating images so the student can
feel the actual figure. The optacon .vas
invented by John Linvill, chairman of
the Electrical Engineering (E.E.) De
partment.
Fowler, who is in the E.E. masters
program, is constructing a "Braille
without papers" system with the help
of Linvill. A casette precoded with
Braille characters is fed into the sys
tem. It is then read out on a display
similar to an optacon without the vib
rations, Fowler explained.
The system also enables students to
make tapes of their own on a standard
Braille keyboard, Fowler said.
"It will be a versatile system, and
will allow the student to do such sim
ple things as making notes in class,"
he said.

Callahan lives in Crothers Memorial
with her guide dog, Luna, and gets
around with ease, she said.
"Luna and I go to classes at the Busi
ness School and R&D building (Center
for Educational Research and De
velopment) and our only problem is
that we run to classes because we're
usually so late," she said.
Fowler uses a cane instead of a guide
dog. He lives off campus because he
lost out on the campus draw, and rides
a bus or walks to school, he said.
Neither Fowler nor Callahan limit
themselves to academics, said Calla
han. She said she loves horseback rid
ing and cross country skiing.
