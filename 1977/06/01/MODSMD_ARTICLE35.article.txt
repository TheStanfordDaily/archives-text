# Iranian Radio-TV hasn't paid debt yet
## 
### Mike Charison 
More than three months after final
reports were submitted, the University
still awaits payment of the first penny
of over $400,000 owed by National
Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT) for
contract work.
"Nothing specific has happened" in
quite some time, said Director of Spon
sored Projects Earl Cilley, who is in
charge of the recovery operation. He
said, however, he was still very confi
dent that most of the outstanding sum
would be paid.
NIRT contracted with the University
to plan a domestic telecommunica
tions satellite system and to develop
programming recommendations for
educational television in Iran.
Principal investigators for the pro
jects were Assoc. Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Bruce Lusignan and Com
munication Prof. Edward Parker.
Terminated
The $978,190, three-year agreement
was terminated suddenly last October
by NIRT which cited "general dissatis
faction" with the contract work as
reason for activating the termination
clause, according to Cilley.
The contract's termination gave the
University 90 days to complete all
work and forward the final product, a
series of reports, to NIRT in Tehran.
Those reports were sent in mid-
February. Their arrival at NIRT has
been confirmed, Cilley said.
Since then, NIRT officials have pre
sumably been reviewing the reports,
and the University has been awaiting
the agency's decision on payment.
Vice Provost for Research William
Massy had ordered the reports re
viewed by a group of faculty members
with expertise in the fields under in

vestigation in the project. The group
reported that it considered the work
"excellent."
"We expect a decision from NIRT
momentarily, and we still expect pay
ment," said Acting Vice Provost for
Research Gerald Lieberman in an in
terview two weeks ago.
Timing expectable
"We're not concerned about the
length of time (it has taken NIRT to
respond)," he said. He said three
months was "not outside the realm of
the timing expected on this.
"I don't believe that no news is bad
news."
Cilley, however, had said "some ac
tion" would be taken by the University
if a decision had not been received by
April 30. Cilley said he received a
Telex from NIRT in early May which
said the review process had been de
layed. He would not comment on what
"action" meant.
Mike Hudnail, staff counsel for the
Office of Business and Finance has
said, "We are looking into all available
channels for getting the money, and
legal channels is one of them."
He said no legal action has been
taken so far and none has been offi
cially proposed.
"We consider the contract valid and
enforceable," Hudnail has said. "I'm
sure we will take all the steps neces
sary to enforce it."
The contract has been plagued by
what Massy has called "administrative
foul-ups" since it was signed in Feb
ruary 1975. Payment problems appa
rently began months before the termi
nation of the contract, but the situation
went unnoticed until work was
speeded up due to termination.

Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT) for
contract work.
"Nothing specific has happened" in
quite some time, said Director of Spon
sored Projects Earl Cilley, who is in
charge of the recovery operation. He
said, however, he was still very confi
dent that most of the outstanding sum
would be paid.
NIRT contracted with the University
to plan a domestic telecommunica
tions satellite system and to develop
programming recommendations for
educational television in Iran.
Principal investigators for the pro
jects were Assoc. Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Bruce Lusignan and Com
munication Prof. Edward Parker.
Terminated
The $978,190, three-year agreement
was terminated suddenly last October
by NIRT which cited "general dissatis
faction" with the contract work as
reason for activating the termination
clause, according to Cilley.
The contract's termination gave the
University 90 days to complete all
work and forward the final product, a
series of reports, to NIRT in Tehran.
Those reports were sent in mid-
February. Their arrival at NIRT has
been confirmed, Cilley said.
Since then, NIRT officials have pre
sumably been reviewing the reports,
and the University has been awaiting
the agency's decision on payment.
Vice Provost for Research William
Massy had ordered the reports re
viewed by a group of faculty members
with expertise in the fields under in

vestigation in the project. The group
reported that it considered the work
"excellent."
"We expect a decision from NIRT
momentarily, and we still expect pay
ment," said Acting Vice Provost for
Research Gerald Lieberman in an in
terview two weeks ago.
Timing expectable
"We're not concerned about the
length of time (it has taken NIRT to
respond)," he said. He said three
months was "not outside the realm of
the timing expected on this.
"I don't believe that no news is bad
news."
Cilley, however, had said "some ac
tion" would be taken by the University
if a decision had not been received by
April 30. Cilley said he received a
Telex from NIRT in early May which
said the review process had been de
layed. He would not comment on what
"action" meant.
Mike Hudnail, staff counsel for the
Office of Business and Finance has
said, "We are looking into all available
channels for getting the money, and
legal channels is one of them."
He said no legal action has been
taken so far and none has been offi
cially proposed.
"We consider the contract valid and
enforceable," Hudnail has said. "I'm
sure we will take all the steps neces
sary to enforce it."
The contract has been plagued by
what Massy has called "administrative
foul-ups" since it was signed in Feb
ruary 1975. Payment problems appa
rently began months before the termi
nation of the contract, but the situation
went unnoticed until work was
speeded up due to termination.
More than three months after final
reports were submitted, the University
still awaits payment of the first penny
of over $400,000 owed by National
Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT) for
contract work.
