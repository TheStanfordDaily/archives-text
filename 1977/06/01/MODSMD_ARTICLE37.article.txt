# New Honor Code likely to be adopted

### Mike Charison 
A new Honor Code, emphasizing
violation prevention and clarity, is
likely to become law when the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
considers the proposal at a meeting
tomorrow.
The new code will include a minor
rewording of the present code as well
as a set of applications and interpreta
tions, according to SCLC Chairman
Philip Rhinelander.
The council submitted its proposal
for the new code in a letter to President
Richard Lyman April 18 and since
then has held a public hearing on the
issue and had the first reading of the
proposal before the council. There it
was unanimously accepted.
Under the Legislative and Judicial

Charter of the University, a piece of
proposed legislation must pass two
readings before the SCLC before be
coming law. According to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons, accep
tance of the new code is all but as
sured.
The SCLC had been meeting for
about two years to attempt to iron out
problems of vagueness in the wording
of the code and lack of community
knowledge about the code, Rhinelan
der said.
Vagueness problems were attacked
mainly through proposed "Interpreta
tions and Applications of the Honor
Code." Interpretation through exam
ple is the method selected which
Rhinelander said the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), the student judicial

body, could use as guidelines.
Community knowledge problems
were the more difficult, Rhinelander
said. He said the SCLC has asked that
blue book covers be changed to in
clude the full text of the Honor Code.
In addition, the group has asked that
an Honor Code Commission be estab
lished to educate all students and fa
culty members about the Honor Code.
Lyons said SCLC members had
hoped for larger turnouts at public
hearings held both before and after an
actual proposal was put forth, but he
rejected the notion that the council
acted without student input.
He said a student survey about the
Honor Code conducted last spring was
"the basis for much of the discussion

in the SCLC."
That survey compared student re
sponses about cheating with a similar
study conducted 15 years before. It
concluded that the level of honesty
here is high; moreover, there was "no
significant difference in the level of
honest" between the two surveys,
Lyons said.
Lyons said he was "especially
pleased" with the new code because,
unlike "so many of the other schools
that looked at their codes, found fault
with them and dropped them or began
to whittle away at the notion of stu
dents assuming responsibility for
honesty and scholarship, the founda
tion of a good code," the University
retained the substance of its original
Honor Code.
