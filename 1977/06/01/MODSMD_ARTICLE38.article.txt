# Prostitution: victimless crime prospers in Nevada, frowned on here
## 
### Mike Hyneman 
Law School Prof. John Kaplan calls prostitution
"the classic nonvictim crime."
A Nevada bordello employe, Joanne, says it's a
line of work she enjoys so much she never takes
vacations.
And several prostitutes' organizations say it's a
practice which localities, not states, should regu
late.
Today, prostitution is effectively dead in this
area. Last December, the city of Palo Alto closed
down numerous "massage parlors," nude en
counter parlors and adult studios that used to line
El Camino Real.
The charge that these establishments were ac
tually houses of prostitution probably came as no
surprise to anyone familiar with the area.
On campus, prostitution used to occur fre
quently, according to one fraternity member who
requested anonymity for himself and his house.
High school customer
He said rooms in his fraternity were once used
for such purposes before complaints from the
mother of a high school customer forced an enfl to
such practices.
As late as last year, however, a prostitute was
hired for a party here which included a striptease
act followed by a raffle. The winner got the prosti
tute's services for the night.
Whether prostitution will continue to exist
only on such a clandestine level here depends
largely on local governments.
Few communities are legalizing prostitution.
As Kaplan noted, "the problem with prostitution

is that most people aren't against it, they're just
against it where they are."
Except for 15 of Nevada's 17 counties. There,
prostitution flourishes. Interestingly enough,
Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and
Washoe County, which includes Reno and
Sparks, are the two counties where such activity
is illegal.
Mustang Ranch
Any study of Nevada's brothels has to begin
with its largest and most well-known, the Mus
tang Ranch. Located just over the Washoe County
line (approximately 10 miles east of Reno), Mus
tang is the "Hilton" of prostitution houses.
The old Mustang, which was just a group of
fenced-in trailors. has been replaced by a newer
and much classier bordello. Mustang 11. From the
outside it looks more like a prison than a brothel.
Everything is surrounded by tall fences (in
cluding an electrically operated gate), and a
guard tower looms over the parking lot. Like all
brothels in Nevada, the only clues to the real
nature of its business are red arrows showing the
way once you leave the highway.
Upon entering the building, however, the vis
itor finds paintings of nudes adorning the walls,
and lushly carpeted floors. Most striking, how
ever, is the welcoming committee — a "lineup" of
10 or so scantily clad and smiling women.
The madam, the woman who keeps track of
the women and in general runs the establishment,
then tells the visitor to take his pick. A visitor
with time can head for the bar, while those in a
hurry can go right on to one of the numerous

bedrooms.
The bordello's owner, Joe Conforte, is more a
businessman than a large scale pimp. He dresses
in expensive suits and drives a car costing at least
$10,000. And as Story County's largest taxpayer,
he is treated as a respectable businessman.
Conforte, like most other Nevada brothel own
ers, pays considerable license fees. He said his
payments approached $100,000 last year.
In California, said Kaplan, "as a practical mat
ter we don't tax prostitution because it's illegal."
This failure to tax is actually a type of subsidy, he
said.
Conforte chose two "working girls," as they
call themselves, and directed us to a "cabbie
room," explaining that he would answer further
questions after driving his lawyer to the airport.
"Cabbie rooms" are lounges furnished for cab
drivers waiting for passengers who they have
brought to the bordello. Mustang pays drivers 30
per cent of whatever their passengers spend.
Biography
Both women were quite open and informative
about their work. Danielle, 27, and quite attrac
tive, said she grew up with her father (her parents
divorced when she was eight). Her father's job as
engineer required frequent moving from one
country to another.
Recently divorced while living in Munich, she
said she heard about Mustang from a friend who
previously was employed thure. A college
graduate with a bachelor's degree in English
(from UC-Berkeley), Danielle said she had been
unable to find a job elsewhere and did not have
the funds to go back to school, although she
would like to obtain her doctorate in the future.
Her only previous occupation had been as a ski
shop clerk. She had worked on call as a prostitute,
however, while attending Cal.
Dottie, 25, said she came from a devout Baptist
family (her parents were still married) and had
gone to college for a while but dropped out for
financial reasons. She had no previous experi
ence as a prostitute.
Women at Mustang work 14-hour shifts and are
expected to do so for at least 21 days straight.
During their shifts they turn an average of eight
tricks, generally more on weekends than week
days.
VD checkups
Both said prostitutes at Mustang are checked
for gonorrhea weekly and for syphilis once every
four weeks. Women pay the examination costs
themselves, which amount to $10 and $15 respec
tively. In addition, each customer is checked for
signs of venereal disease, and service is refused if
signs are noticed.
When asked whether having sex eight times a
day becomes a routine job, both said this is not the
case. Both women said "they get very attractive
customers quite a lot" who really turn them on.
Repeats who come back regularly and have sex

with the same girl each time, are also common.
Other Nevada brothels provided financial in
formation. The Cottontail Ranch at Lida Junction
has gained considerable notoriety due to the
political activities of its owner, Beverly Harrell.
She ran for the state legislature and lost by a
slim margin in the general election.
$500 weekly
One Cottontail prostitute estimated her own
earnings to be $500 per week. She receives 50 per
cent from her tricks, she said. None of the state's
brothels allow prostitutes to keep more than 60
per cent.
The ranch itself, accepts credit cards for pay
ment of sexual services, as do other brothels. Mas
ter Charge emblems are found above each bed,
and the bordello also honors BankAmericard and
Diner's Club. It also boasts a two-mile airstrip,
making it one of the world's unique airports.
Just south lies another fly-in brothel, Fran's Star
Ranch. Fran York is both owner and madam. Her
women are continuously on call, rather than
working shifts, though they don't have to remain
the minimum 21 days that other houses require.
This bordello is unusual in the enthusiasm
York and her prostitutes show. One working girl,
Joanne, was questioned while she was taking a
bath. Twentv-one years old, she was raised a Bap
tist in Southeastern Virginia. Her previous occu
pations included being a sales clerk, secretary

and Sunday School teacher. She said she enjoys
her work so much she never takes vacations.
York herself was very frank, probably because
her brothel lies in Nye county, which has few, if
any, restrictions on prostitution. She said she of
fers a $1 discount on all services to Stanford stu
dents with current student identification.
In addition to customary sexual services, she
said, this establishment will cater to persons with
more unusual interests. Employes keep a supply
of handcuffs, ropes and whips on hand, and will
even give golden showers upon request.
But more of York's customers, like those at
Nevada's other brothels, come there for either
sexual intercourse or what is known in the busi
ness as "half and half" (oral sex and intercourse).
Customers range in age from 18 to 82.
A bill similar to Nevada's local option statute is
likely to be brought before the California legisla
ture. It would have little chance of passing on its
first attempt.
Eventual passage of a local option measure,
however, might well occur.
"If you are worried about law enforcement, you
would license houses," Kaplan stated. "Any bus
iness that is that intimately involved with the
public gets regulated. Restaurants get regulated.
Prostitution ought to have the same type of regu
lations. Not that they are awfully effective, but
simply because they are better than nothing."

Joanne, was questioned while she was taking a
bath. Twentv-one years old, she was raised a Bap
tist in Southeastern Virginia. Her previous occu
pations included being a sales clerk, secretary

and Sunday School teacher. She said she enjoys
her work so much she never takes vacations.
York herself was very frank, probably because
her brothel lies in Nye county, which has few, if
any, restrictions on prostitution. She said she of
fers a $1 discount on all services to Stanford stu
dents with current student identification.
In addition to customary sexual services, she
said, this establishment will cater to persons with
more unusual interests. Employes keep a supply
of handcuffs, ropes and whips on hand, and will
even give golden showers upon request.
But more of York's customers, like those at
Nevada's other brothels, come there for either
sexual intercourse or what is known in the busi
ness as "half and half" (oral sex and intercourse).
Customers range in age from 18 to 82.
A bill similar to Nevada's local option statute is
likely to be brought before the California legisla
ture. It would have little chance of passing on its
first attempt.
Eventual passage of a local option measure,
however, might well occur.
"If you are worried about law enforcement, you
would license houses," Kaplan stated. "Any bus
iness that is that intimately involved with the
public gets regulated. Restaurants get regulated.
Prostitution ought to have the same type of regu

simply because they are better than nothing."
Law School Prof. John Kaplan calls prostitution
"the classic nonvictim crime."
A Nevada bordello employe, Joanne, says it's a
line of work she enjoys so much she never takes
vacations.
And several prostitutes' organizations say it's a
practice which localities, not states, should regu
late.
Today, prostitution is effectively dead in this
area. Last December, the city of Palo Alto closed
down numerous "massage parlors," nude en
counter parlors and adult studios that used to line
El Camino Real.
The charge that these establishments were ac
tually houses of prostitution probably came as no
surprise to anyone familiar with the area.
On campus, prostitution used to occur fre
quently, according to one fraternity member who
requested anonymity for himself and his house.
High school customer
He said rooms in his fraternity were once used
for such purposes before complaints from the
mother of a high school customer forced an enfl to
such practices.
As late as last year, however, a prostitute was
hired for a party here which included a striptease
act followed by a raffle. The winner got the prosti
tute's services for the night.
Whether prostitution will continue to exist
only on such a clandestine level here depends
largely on local governments.
Few communities are legalizing prostitution.
As Kaplan noted, "the problem with prostitution

is that most people aren't against it, they're just
against it where they are."
Except for 15 of Nevada's 17 counties. There,
prostitution flourishes. Interestingly enough,
Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and
Washoe County, which includes Reno and
Sparks, are the two counties where such activity

Mustang Ranch
Any study of Nevada's brothels has to begin
with its largest and most well-known, the Mus
tang Ranch. Located just over the Washoe County
line (approximately 10 miles east of Reno), Mus
tang is the "Hilton" of prostitution houses.
The old Mustang, which was just a group of
fenced-in trailors. has been replaced by a newer
and much classier bordello. Mustang 11. From the
outside it looks more like a prison than a brothel.
Everything is surrounded by tall fences (in
cluding an electrically operated gate), and a
guard tower looms over the parking lot. Like all
brothels in Nevada, the only clues to the real
nature of its business are red arrows showing the
way once you leave the highway.
Upon entering the building, however, the vis
itor finds paintings of nudes adorning the walls,
and lushly carpeted floors. Most striking, how
ever, is the welcoming committee — a "lineup" of
10 or so scantily clad and smiling women.
The madam, the woman who keeps track of
the women and in general runs the establishment,
then tells the visitor to take his pick. A visitor
with time can head for the bar, while those in a
hurry can go right on to one of the numerous

bedrooms.
The bordello's owner, Joe Conforte, is more a
businessman than a large scale pimp. He dresses
in expensive suits and drives a car costing at least
$10,000. And as Story County's largest taxpayer,
he is treated as a respectable businessman.
Conforte, like most other Nevada brothel own
ers, pays considerable license fees. He said his
payments approached $100,000 last year.
In California, said Kaplan, "as a practical mat
ter we don't tax prostitution because it's illegal."
This failure to tax is actually a type of subsidy, he
said.
Conforte chose two "working girls," as they
call themselves, and directed us to a "cabbie
room," explaining that he would answer further
questions after driving his lawyer to the airport.
"Cabbie rooms" are lounges furnished for cab
drivers waiting for passengers who they have
brought to the bordello. Mustang pays drivers 30
per cent of whatever their passengers spend.
Biography
Both women were quite open and informative
about their work. Danielle, 27, and quite attrac
tive, said she grew up with her father (her parents
divorced when she was eight). Her father's job as
engineer required frequent moving from one
country to another.
Recently divorced while living in Munich, she
said she heard about Mustang from a friend who
previously was employed thure. A college
graduate with a bachelor's degree in English
(from UC-Berkeley), Danielle said she had been
unable to find a job elsewhere and did not have
the funds to go back to school, although she
would like to obtain her doctorate in the future.
Her only previous occupation had been as a ski
shop clerk. She had worked on call as a prostitute,
however, while attending Cal.
Dottie, 25, said she came from a devout Baptist
family (her parents were still married) and had
gone to college for a while but dropped out for
financial reasons. She had no previous experi
ence as a prostitute.
Women at Mustang work 14-hour shifts and are
expected to do so for at least 21 days straight.
During their shifts they turn an average of eight
tricks, generally more on weekends than week
days.
VD checkups
Both said prostitutes at Mustang are checked
for gonorrhea weekly and for syphilis once every
four weeks. Women pay the examination costs
themselves, which amount to $10 and $15 respec
tively. In addition, each customer is checked for
signs of venereal disease, and service is refused if
signs are noticed.
When asked whether having sex eight times a
day becomes a routine job, both said this is not the
case. Both women said "they get very attractive
customers quite a lot" who really turn them on.
Repeats who come back regularly and have sex

with the same girl each time, are also common.
Other Nevada brothels provided financial in
formation. The Cottontail Ranch at Lida Junction
has gained considerable notoriety due to the
political activities of its owner, Beverly Harrell.
She ran for the state legislature and lost by a
slim margin in the general election.
$500 weekly
One Cottontail prostitute estimated her own
earnings to be $500 per week. She receives 50 per
cent from her tricks, she said. None of the state's
brothels allow prostitutes to keep more than 60
per cent.
The ranch itself, accepts credit cards for pay
ment of sexual services, as do other brothels. Mas
ter Charge emblems are found above each bed,
and the bordello also honors BankAmericard and
Diner's Club. It also boasts a two-mile airstrip,
making it one of the world's unique airports.
Just south lies another fly-in brothel, Fran's Star
Ranch. Fran York is both owner and madam. Her
women are continuously on call, rather than
working shifts, though they don't have to remain
the minimum 21 days that other houses require.
This bordello is unusual in the enthusiasm
York and her prostitutes show. One working girl,
Joanne, was questioned while she was taking a
bath. Twentv-one years old, she was raised a Bap

signs of venereal disease, and service is refused if
signs are noticed.
When asked whether having sex eight times a
day becomes a routine job, both said this is not the
case. Both women said "they get very attractive
customers quite a lot" who really turn them on.
Repeats who come back regularly and have sex

with the same girl each time, are also common.
Other Nevada brothels provided financial in
formation. The Cottontail Ranch at Lida Junction
has gained considerable notoriety due to the
political activities of its owner, Beverly Harrell.
She ran for the state legislature and lost by a
slim margin in the general election.
$500 weekly
One Cottontail prostitute estimated her own
earnings to be $500 per week. She receives 50 per
cent from her tricks, she said. None of the state's
brothels allow prostitutes to keep more than 60
per cent.
The ranch itself, accepts credit cards for pay
ment of sexual services, as do other brothels. Mas
ter Charge emblems are found above each bed,
and the bordello also honors BankAmericard and
Diner's Club. It also boasts a two-mile airstrip,
making it one of the world's unique airports.
Just south lies another fly-in brothel, Fran's Star
Ranch. Fran York is both owner and madam. Her
women are continuously on call, rather than
working shifts, though they don't have to remain
the minimum 21 days that other houses require.
This bordello is unusual in the enthusiasm
York and her prostitutes show. One working girl,
Joanne, was questioned while she was taking a
bath. Twentv-one years old, she was raised a Bap
tist in Southeastern Virginia. Her previous occu
pations included being a sales clerk, secretary

and Sunday School teacher. She said she enjoys
her work so much she never takes vacations.
York herself was very frank, probably because
her brothel lies in Nye county, which has few, if
any, restrictions on prostitution. She said she of
fers a $1 discount on all services to Stanford stu
dents with current student identification.
In addition to customary sexual services, she
said, this establishment will cater to persons with
more unusual interests. Employes keep a supply
of handcuffs, ropes and whips on hand, and will
even give golden showers upon request.
But more of York's customers, like those at
Nevada's other brothels, come there for either
sexual intercourse or what is known in the busi
ness as "half and half" (oral sex and intercourse).
Customers range in age from 18 to 82.
A bill similar to Nevada's local option statute is
likely to be brought before the California legisla
ture. It would have little chance of passing on its
first attempt.
Eventual passage of a local option measure,
however, might well occur.
"If you are worried about law enforcement, you
would license houses," Kaplan stated. "Any bus
iness that is that intimately involved with the
public gets regulated. Restaurants get regulated.
Prostitution ought to have the same type of regu
lations. Not that they are awfully effective, but
simply because they are better than nothing."
Law School Prof. John Kaplan calls prostitution
"the classic nonvictim crime."
A Nevada bordello employe, Joanne, says it's a
line of work she enjoys so much she never takes
vacations.
And several prostitutes' organizations say it's a
practice which localities, not states, should regu
late.
Today, prostitution is effectively dead in this
area. Last December, the city of Palo Alto closed
down numerous "massage parlors," nude en
counter parlors and adult studios that used to line
El Camino Real.
The charge that these establishments were ac
tually houses of prostitution probably came as no
surprise to anyone familiar with the area.
On campus, prostitution used to occur fre
quently, according to one fraternity member who
requested anonymity for himself and his house.
High school customer
He said rooms in his fraternity were once used
for such purposes before complaints from the
mother of a high school customer forced an enfl to
such practices.
As late as last year, however, a prostitute was
hired for a party here which included a striptease
act followed by a raffle. The winner got the prosti
tute's services for the night.
Whether prostitution will continue to exist
only on such a clandestine level here depends
largely on local governments.
Few communities are legalizing prostitution.
As Kaplan noted, "the problem with prostitution

is that most people aren't against it, they're just
against it where they are."
Except for 15 of Nevada's 17 counties. There,
prostitution flourishes. Interestingly enough,
Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and
Washoe County, which includes Reno and
Sparks, are the two counties where such activity
is illegal.
Mustang Ranch
Any study of Nevada's brothels has to begin
with its largest and most well-known, the Mus
tang Ranch. Located just over the Washoe County
line (approximately 10 miles east of Reno), Mus
tang is the "Hilton" of prostitution houses.
The old Mustang, which was just a group of
fenced-in trailors. has been replaced by a newer
and much classier bordello. Mustang 11. From the
outside it looks more like a prison than a brothel.
Everything is surrounded by tall fences (in
cluding an electrically operated gate), and a
guard tower looms over the parking lot. Like all
brothels in Nevada, the only clues to the real
nature of its business are red arrows showing the
way once you leave the highway.
Upon entering the building, however, the vis
itor finds paintings of nudes adorning the walls,
and lushly carpeted floors. Most striking, how
ever, is the welcoming committee — a "lineup" of
10 or so scantily clad and smiling women.
The madam, the woman who keeps track of
the women and in general runs the establishment,
then tells the visitor to take his pick. A visitor
with time can head for the bar, while those in a
hurry can go right on to one of the numerous

bedrooms.
The bordello's owner, Joe Conforte, is more a
businessman than a large scale pimp. He dresses
in expensive suits and drives a car costing at least
$10,000. And as Story County's largest taxpayer,
he is treated as a respectable businessman.
Conforte, like most other Nevada brothel own
ers, pays considerable license fees. He said his
payments approached $100,000 last year.
In California, said Kaplan, "as a practical mat
ter we don't tax prostitution because it's illegal."
This failure to tax is actually a type of subsidy, he
said.
Conforte chose two "working girls," as they
call themselves, and directed us to a "cabbie
room," explaining that he would answer further
questions after driving his lawyer to the airport.
"Cabbie rooms" are lounges furnished for cab
drivers waiting for passengers who they have
brought to the bordello. Mustang pays drivers 30
per cent of whatever their passengers spend.
Biography
Both women were quite open and informative
about their work. Danielle, 27, and quite attrac
tive, said she grew up with her father (her parents
divorced when she was eight). Her father's job as
engineer required frequent moving from one
country to another.
Recently divorced while living in Munich, she
said she heard about Mustang from a friend who
previously was employed thure. A college
graduate with a bachelor's degree in English
(from UC-Berkeley), Danielle said she had been
unable to find a job elsewhere and did not have
the funds to go back to school, although she
would like to obtain her doctorate in the future.
Her only previous occupation had been as a ski
shop clerk. She had worked on call as a prostitute,
however, while attending Cal.
Dottie, 25, said she came from a devout Baptist
family (her parents were still married) and had
gone to college for a while but dropped out for
financial reasons. She had no previous experi
ence as a prostitute.
Women at Mustang work 14-hour shifts and are
expected to do so for at least 21 days straight.
During their shifts they turn an average of eight
tricks, generally more on weekends than week
days.
VD checkups
Both said prostitutes at Mustang are checked
for gonorrhea weekly and for syphilis once every
four weeks. Women pay the examination costs
themselves, which amount to $10 and $15 respec
tively. In addition, each customer is checked for
signs of venereal disease, and service is refused if
signs are noticed.
When asked whether having sex eight times a

Biography
Both women were quite open and informative
about their work. Danielle, 27, and quite attrac
tive, said she grew up with her father (her parents
divorced when she was eight). Her father's job as
engineer required frequent moving from one
country to another.
Recently divorced while living in Munich, she
said she heard about Mustang from a friend who
previously was employed thure. A college
graduate with a bachelor's degree in English
(from UC-Berkeley), Danielle said she had been
unable to find a job elsewhere and did not have
the funds to go back to school, although she
would like to obtain her doctorate in the future.
Her only previous occupation had been as a ski
shop clerk. She had worked on call as a prostitute,
however, while attending Cal.
Dottie, 25, said she came from a devout Baptist
family (her parents were still married) and had
gone to college for a while but dropped out for
financial reasons. She had no previous experi
ence as a prostitute.
Women at Mustang work 14-hour shifts and are
expected to do so for at least 21 days straight.
During their shifts they turn an average of eight
tricks, generally more on weekends than week
days.
VD checkups
Both said prostitutes at Mustang are checked
for gonorrhea weekly and for syphilis once every
four weeks. Women pay the examination costs
themselves, which amount to $10 and $15 respec
tively. In addition, each customer is checked for
signs of venereal disease, and service is refused if
signs are noticed.
When asked whether having sex eight times a
day becomes a routine job, both said this is not the
case. Both women said "they get very attractive
customers quite a lot" who really turn them on.
Repeats who come back regularly and have sex

with the same girl each time, are also common.
Other Nevada brothels provided financial in
formation. The Cottontail Ranch at Lida Junction
has gained considerable notoriety due to the
political activities of its owner, Beverly Harrell.
She ran for the state legislature and lost by a
slim margin in the general election.
$500 weekly
One Cottontail prostitute estimated her own
earnings to be $500 per week. She receives 50 per
cent from her tricks, she said. None of the state's
brothels allow prostitutes to keep more than 60
per cent.
The ranch itself, accepts credit cards for pay
ment of sexual services, as do other brothels. Mas
ter Charge emblems are found above each bed,
and the bordello also honors BankAmericard and
Diner's Club. It also boasts a two-mile airstrip,
making it one of the world's unique airports.
Just south lies another fly-in brothel, Fran's Star
Ranch. Fran York is both owner and madam. Her
women are continuously on call, rather than
working shifts, though they don't have to remain
the minimum 21 days that other houses require.
This bordello is unusual in the enthusiasm
York and her prostitutes show. One working girl,
Joanne, was questioned while she was taking a
bath. Twentv-one years old, she was raised a Bap
tist in Southeastern Virginia. Her previous occu
pations included being a sales clerk, secretary

and Sunday School teacher. She said she enjoys
her work so much she never takes vacations.
York herself was very frank, probably because
her brothel lies in Nye county, which has few, if
any, restrictions on prostitution. She said she of
fers a $1 discount on all services to Stanford stu
dents with current student identification.
In addition to customary sexual services, she
said, this establishment will cater to persons with
more unusual interests. Employes keep a supply
of handcuffs, ropes and whips on hand, and will
even give golden showers upon request.
But more of York's customers, like those at
Nevada's other brothels, come there for either
sexual intercourse or what is known in the busi
ness as "half and half" (oral sex and intercourse).
Customers range in age from 18 to 82.
A bill similar to Nevada's local option statute is
likely to be brought before the California legisla
ture. It would have little chance of passing on its
first attempt.
Eventual passage of a local option measure,
however, might well occur.
"If you are worried about law enforcement, you
would license houses," Kaplan stated. "Any bus
iness that is that intimately involved with the
public gets regulated. Restaurants get regulated.
Prostitution ought to have the same type of regu
lations. Not that they are awfully effective, but
simply because they are better than nothing."
Law School Prof. John Kaplan calls prostitution
"the classic nonvictim crime."
A Nevada bordello employe, Joanne, says it's a
line of work she enjoys so much she never takes
vacations.
And several prostitutes' organizations say it's a
practice which localities, not states, should regu
late.
Today, prostitution is effectively dead in this
area. Last December, the city of Palo Alto closed
down numerous "massage parlors," nude en
counter parlors and adult studios that used to line
El Camino Real.
The charge that these establishments were ac
tually houses of prostitution probably came as no
surprise to anyone familiar with the area.
On campus, prostitution used to occur fre
quently, according to one fraternity member who
requested anonymity for himself and his house.
High school customer
He said rooms in his fraternity were once used
for such purposes before complaints from the
mother of a high school customer forced an enfl to
such practices.
As late as last year, however, a prostitute was
hired for a party here which included a striptease
act followed by a raffle. The winner got the prosti
tute's services for the night.
Whether prostitution will continue to exist
only on such a clandestine level here depends
largely on local governments.
Few communities are legalizing prostitution.
As Kaplan noted, "the problem with prostitution

is that most people aren't against it, they're just
against it where they are."
Except for 15 of Nevada's 17 counties. There,
prostitution flourishes. Interestingly enough,
Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and
Washoe County, which includes Reno and
Sparks, are the two counties where such activity
is illegal.
Mustang Ranch
Any study of Nevada's brothels has to begin
with its largest and most well-known, the Mus
tang Ranch. Located just over the Washoe County
line (approximately 10 miles east of Reno), Mus
tang is the "Hilton" of prostitution houses.
The old Mustang, which was just a group of
fenced-in trailors. has been replaced by a newer
and much classier bordello. Mustang 11. From the
outside it looks more like a prison than a brothel.
Everything is surrounded by tall fences (in
cluding an electrically operated gate), and a
guard tower looms over the parking lot. Like all
brothels in Nevada, the only clues to the real
nature of its business are red arrows showing the
way once you leave the highway.
Upon entering the building, however, the vis
itor finds paintings of nudes adorning the walls,
and lushly carpeted floors. Most striking, how
ever, is the welcoming committee — a "lineup" of
10 or so scantily clad and smiling women.
The madam, the woman who keeps track of
the women and in general runs the establishment,
then tells the visitor to take his pick. A visitor
with time can head for the bar, while those in a
hurry can go right on to one of the numerous

bedrooms.
The bordello's owner, Joe Conforte, is more a
businessman than a large scale pimp. He dresses
in expensive suits and drives a car costing at least
$10,000. And as Story County's largest taxpayer,
he is treated as a respectable businessman.
Conforte, like most other Nevada brothel own
ers, pays considerable license fees. He said his
payments approached $100,000 last year.
In California, said Kaplan, "as a practical mat
ter we don't tax prostitution because it's illegal."
This failure to tax is actually a type of subsidy, he
said.
Conforte chose two "working girls," as they
call themselves, and directed us to a "cabbie
room," explaining that he would answer further
questions after driving his lawyer to the airport.
"Cabbie rooms" are lounges furnished for cab
drivers waiting for passengers who they have
brought to the bordello. Mustang pays drivers 30
per cent of whatever their passengers spend.
