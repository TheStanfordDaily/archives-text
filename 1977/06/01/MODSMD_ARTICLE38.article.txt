# Prostitution: victimless crime prospers in Nevada, frowned on here
## 
### Mike Hyneman 
Law School Prof. John Kaplan calls prostitution
"the classic nonvictim crime."
A Nevada bordello employe, Joanne, says it's a
line of work she enjoys so much she never takes
vacations.
And several prostitutes' organizations say it's a
practice which localities, not states, should regu
late.
Today, prostitution is effectively dead in this
area. Last December, the city of Palo Alto closed
down numerous "massage parlors," nude en
counter parlors and adult studios that used to line
El Camino Real.
The charge that these establishments were ac
tually houses of prostitution probably came as no
surprise to anyone familiar with the area.
On campus, prostitution used to occur fre
quently, according to one fraternity member who
requested anonymity for himself and his house.
High school customer
He said rooms in his fraternity were once used
for such purposes before complaints from the
mother of a high school customer forced an enfl to
such practices.
As late as last year, however, a prostitute was
hired for a party here which included a striptease
act followed by a raffle. The winner got the prosti
tute's services for the night.
Whether prostitution will continue to exist
only on such a clandestine level here depends
largely on local governments.
Few communities are legalizing prostitution.
As Kaplan noted, "the problem with prostitution

is that most people aren't against it, they're just
against it where they are."
Except for 15 of Nevada's 17 counties. There,
prostitution flourishes. Interestingly enough,
Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, and
Washoe County, which includes Reno and
Sparks, are the two counties where such activity
is illegal.
Mustang Ranch
Any study of Nevada's brothels has to begin
with its largest and most well-known, the Mus
tang Ranch. Located just over the Washoe County
line (approximately 10 miles east of Reno), Mus
tang is the "Hilton" of prostitution houses.
The old Mustang, which was just a group of
fenced-in trailors. has been replaced by a newer
and much classier bordello. Mustang 11. From the
outside it looks more like a prison than a brothel.
Everything is surrounded by tall fences (in
cluding an electrically operated gate), and a
guard tower looms over the parking lot. Like all
brothels in Nevada, the only clues to the real
nature of its business are red arrows showing the
way once you leave the highway.
Upon entering the building, however, the vis
itor finds paintings of nudes adorning the walls,
and lushly carpeted floors. Most striking, how
ever, is the welcoming committee â€” a "lineup" of
10 or so scantily clad and smiling women.
The madam, the woman who keeps track of
the women and in general runs the establishment,
then tells the visitor to take his pick. A visitor
with time can head for the bar, while those in a
hurry can go right on to one of the numerous

bedrooms.
The bordello's owner, Joe Conforte, is more a
businessman than a large scale pimp. He dresses
in expensive suits and drives a car costing at least
$10,000. And as Story County's largest taxpayer,
he is treated as a respectable businessman.
Conforte, like most other Nevada brothel own
ers, pays considerable license fees. He said his
payments approached $100,000 last year.
In California, said Kaplan, "as a practical mat
ter we don't tax prostitution because it's illegal."
This failure to tax is actually a type of subsidy, he
said.
Conforte chose two "working girls," as they
call themselves, and directed us to a "cabbie
room," explaining that he would answer further
questions after driving his lawyer to the airport.
"Cabbie rooms" are lounges furnished for cab
drivers waiting for passengers who they have
brought to the bordello. Mustang pays drivers 30
per cent of whatever their passengers spend.
Biography
Both women were quite open and informative
about their work. Danielle, 27, and quite attrac
tive, said she grew up with her father (her parents
divorced when she was eight). Her father's job as
engineer required frequent moving from one
country to another.
Recently divorced while living in Munich, she
said she heard about Mustang from a friend who
previously was employed thure. A college
graduate with a bachelor's degree in English
(from UC-Berkeley), Danielle said she had been
