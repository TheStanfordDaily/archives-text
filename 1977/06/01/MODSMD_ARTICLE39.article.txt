JL he melody line of "Sunrise
Sunset" bangs out from the
slightly out-of-tune piano. "I
need more tenor, don't forget
to watch me for dynamic

rector. The singers start
again: "Sunrise, sunset, sun

It was a Thursday evening.
The place — Broadway's
theatre district in New York
City? No, this all happened in
several of Stanford's dining
halls and dormitory lounges.
This year at Stanford at

ance. But Doug Bedard is riot
trying to achieve stardom. "I
won't go into the theatre for
employment," he says, "it's
too hard to become a star now
and it's really not worth be
coming anything else."
As an economics and
communication double
major, he hopes to attend a
law school like N.Y.U. His fu
ture plans are for some ki nd of
corporate law or legal work
for a theatrical production
company.
Doug's performing career
began with a role in The
Mikado at age 10. and has
been a hobby ever since. "I'm
a ham from way back," he
says, and explains that any
one in the theatre does it as a
way of getting attention.
Stanford isn't the place to
come for drama he admits,
but he praises "dorm drama"
for being unstructured and
free from academic pressures.
"For experienced people
it's a chance to do something
they love, and when you love
something like that you can
fit it into even the busiest
schedule," he says. For those
without theatrical experience
it is a good chance to do some

contact with the audience,
making them feel what I feel
about a scene or a show —
that's my reward."
.A.nother of Stanford's ex
perienced musical come
dians is senior Liza Kinsell.
Last year, the star of Gypsy,
she was recently Golde in
Fiddler on the Hoof. With a
big Jimmy Carter smile, she
squints and recalls sitting on
her swing set as a child, dying
to be "Funny Girl." She even
has Streisand's nose, but the
resemblance ends there, with
a heavier figure and
shoulder-length blonde hair.

background during high
school led her to involvement

least eight major Broadway
musicals will have been pre
sented by independent stu
dent groups and dormitories.
The students involved are for
the most part not drama or
music majors and they re
ceive no academic credit for
their participation. Although
by day they are preparing to
be successful doctors,
lawyers or politicians of the
future, at night these students
are Stanford's musical come
dians.
At a university known
chiefly for its academic repu
tation, the amount of interest
in the musical stage might
seem unusual. One could ex
pect students here to have
their minds geared only to
ward studies and graduate
school futures, with weekend
social activities for relaxa
tion.
With quite a few people,
today this is not the case, nor
has it been true of Stanford's
past. From the March, 1908,
Stanford Alumnus: "One of
the leading phases of Stan
ford social life is the interest
manifested in its dramatic
world . . . where there are
forces at work to draw out the
best efforts that a college
community possesses there is
very apt to be unusual ability
discovered and fostered."
The forces at work in Doug
Bedard's theatrical career at
Stanford have been Toyon
Hall, the Savoyards and
Ram's Head. The abilities this
senior from San Jose has de
veloped here have been in
performing and directing. At
Stanford Doug has directed
Don't Drink the Water, Man of
La Mancha, Gypsy, The USA,
and he produced Fiddler on
the Roof. He has had leading
roles here in J. 8., The Music
Man, 7'he Mikado, Applause,
and recently performed King
Henry II in Lion in Winter at
Toyon.
A five-foot-nine inch build,
dimpled chin and pointed
nose do not give him a
stereotypical "star" appear

thing they'd like to try.
Having been both an actor
and director here, Doug finds
directing more difficult. The
student director has to deal
with all levels of talent and aIL
types of people. "It's really
hard to be a peer director," he
explains, "you've got to be a
psychoanalyst too."
But the rewards of direct
ing are well worth the time
and patience, he believes. He
tells of a moving scene from
Man of La Mancha, the first
musical he directed. As the
scene ended the audience
was completely still for a full
minute. "Silence was my re
ward, because 1 knew I had
gotten to the audience. It's
gorgeous when you achieve

at Stanford, but she will prob
ably use her communication
major in public relations
work for the travel industry.
"I'm too chicken to try and
break my leg on Broadway.
But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get
braver," she says. She de
scribes her love for singing as
being one of the best ways of
expressing herself.
"So many people here are
multi-talented. The theatre is
a way of expression that's not
sitting behind a desk read
ing." According to Liza, it's
also a way of meeting a lot of
nice people here.
is a good
description of energetic mus

ical director Sam Spigelman.
A native of New York City,
Sam plans to return to the
East for medical school. Later
he wants a career as a pediat
rician.
"Music is my hobby, not
my profession," he says. At
Stanford Sam has musically
directed Man of La Mancha,
Gypsy and Fiddler on the
Roof. Being a pre-med and a
teaching assistant in the Biol
ogy Department hasn't kept
him from his music. Neither
will bec<»ming a doctor. "1
won't let it,"he says, "if you
use your time wisely you can
do it."
At rehearsals Sam is known
mostly as a comedian along
with his musical talents. Di
recting in stocking feet, beige
slacks and a silky dress shirt
with the sleeves rolled up,
Sammy feels each song with
his facial expressions. His
eyebrows portray every mood
change in the music. After
one song performed correctly
at a Fiddler rehearsal he
throws kisses at the cast, and
during another his Jewish ac
cent comes through with,
"Sweetness! Sweetness! You
gotta get on tune honey. . .
When at home in New
York, Sam is a frequent
theatre-goer. He doesn't think
Californians have much ex
posure to the theatre. But it is
clear that anyone in a show of
his leaves Stanford with a bet
ter appreciation of the musi
cal stage Sam loves so much.
of the students who
comprise the casts of dorm
shows have never been in a
production before. Tony
Brooke, a senior in the En

glish Department, had no
previous theatrical experi
ence before he was a chorus
member in Applause.
Thinking it would be fun to
learn the dances, Tony au
ditioned without a lot of ex
pectations. "I didn't think
there'd be so much rehearsing
for chorus parts. People in the
starring roles are the ones
most involved in the busy
work, like painting and build
ing sets," he says.
That separates Stanford
shows from professional
theatre, but there are other
differences. With the excep
tion of Ram's Head and the
Savoyards, most of the stu
dent and dorm shows are not
performed in theatres. Rather,
modifications and innova

people. A young man waiting
offstage leans against a wall,
Hi-liter in one hand and Re
naissance history book in the
other. Sitting in another part
of the room, a female student
intently studies graphs and
charts spread across a table,
ignoring the singing a few
feet away. Others have cal
culators with them for prob
lem sets.
Since everyone isn't always
on stage at once, rehearsal
time can be study time also.
The average student show re
quires about three hours of
time per night, three to four
nights per week. That is for
the first month-and-a-half of
rehearsing. In the two weeks
before a show opens, cast
members spend each night

'I'm too chicken to try and break my leg on
Broadway. But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get braver.'

tions are made to sets for their
effectiveness in a dining hall
or lounge.
A 20-foot staircase was
built for a Man of La Mancha
scene in Toyon three years
ago. It was re-used last year in
Gypsy. The platforms for the
ship in Anything Goes had to
be small enough to carry in
and out of Otero dining room
each night. And a chain link
fence was the only set needed
inGodspeJi there a year later.
Lights are usually hung on
poles suspended fitom the
ceiling.
During rehearsals, there's a
distinct characteristic that
sets Stanford's musical com
edians apart from other show

practicing for four hours or
more.
But when the lights go up
and the show begins, no one
is remembering all the hours
of work and loss of sleep from
late rehearsals. Besides, the
make-shift theatres are usu
ally packed to capacity. Ced
ro's musical Grease drew
standing room only audi
ences of 220 people each
night, and that was after 30 to
40 people in line were turned
away. With an even larger
hall, Toyon has had the same
situation the past two years
with Gypsy and The Music
Man. For Cabaret, an extra
11:30 p.m. performance was
added on the last night, and it
was filled.

The rise in dorm musical
drama has occurred over the
last four years, primarily in
undergraduate houses. Stu
dent audiences have been en
tertained by some of Broad
way's best musicals, includ
ing: Man of La Mancha, The
Music Man, Company, Fi
nian's Rainbow, Camelot,
You're a Good Man Charlie
Brown, Bye Bye Birdie, Any
thing Goes, The Fantasticks,
Gypsy, How to Succeed in
Business, Godspeli, Grease,
Cabaret, The Boyfriend,
Damn Yankees and Sweet
Charity.
Recent dorm plays have
been: J. 8., Don't Drink the
Water, You Can't Take it With
You, Inherit the Wind, The
Man Who Came to Dinner,
Plaza Suite, Charlie's Aunt,
TheCrucible, The Skin of Our
Teeth, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and Lion in
Winter.
Dorm productions are more
plentiful now. not only be
cause of so much enthusiasm,
but financial and technical
burdens have lessened in re
cent years. An average dorm
show costs about $300, ex
penses staying relatively low
since no hall has to be rented,
and in some cases royalties
are ignored. The Under
graduate Lighting Project
(ULP) rents some $9000
worth of equipment to stu
dent plays for only $1.25 per
light. (Free admission is
standard, although cast
members often plea for dona
tionsat the end of each show.)
Different people will give
you different explanations of
why all the interest in student
theatre exists at Stanford.
Common to most of the
school's musical comedians
though, is a desire to have a
good time, and to meet other
students outside the clas
sroom or library.
Aside from the experienced
having an opportunity to do
something they love, or the
inexperienced using their last
chance to do something
they'd been wanting to try,
the involvement here seems
to have even more of a special
attraction. Some call it the
"magic" of the theatre.
Norma Melloling, the
"dorm mama" and secretary
of Toyon Hall for seven years,
is the biggest fan of every
show performed there and
she defines the special attrac
tion as, "the fun of creating
something."
To put on a fantastic show
from zero, is to have a group
of people arrive simultane
ously at a goal, she says.
Stanford's musical come
dians are only one of several
groups on campus that help
keep students active with
each other. But they are a spe
cial group, as one can see
from their goal. While having
fun themselves they bring a
little theatrical magic into the
Stanford experience of those
who sit on a dormitory floor
to watch.

With quite a few people,
today this is not the case, nor
has it been true of Stanford's
past. From the March, 1908,
Stanford Alumnus: "One of
the leading phases of Stan
ford social life is the interest
manifested in its dramatic
world . . . where there are
forces at work to draw out the
best efforts that a college
community possesses there is
very apt to be unusual ability
discovered and fostered."
The forces at work in Doug
Bedard's theatrical career at
Stanford have been Toyon
Hall, the Savoyards and
Ram's Head. The abilities this
senior from San Jose has de
veloped here have been in
performing and directing. At
Stanford Doug has directed
Don't Drink the Water, Man of
La Mancha, Gypsy, The USA,
and he produced Fiddler on
the Roof. He has had leading
roles here in J. 8., The Music
Man, 7'he Mikado, Applause,
and recently performed King
Henry II in Lion in Winter at
Toyon.
A five-foot-nine inch build,
dimpled chin and pointed
nose do not give him a
stereotypical "star" appear

thing they'd like to try.
Having been both an actor
and director here, Doug finds
directing more difficult. The
student director has to deal
with all levels of talent and aIL
types of people. "It's really
hard to be a peer director," he
explains, "you've got to be a
psychoanalyst too."
But the rewards of direct
ing are well worth the time
and patience, he believes. He
tells of a moving scene from
Man of La Mancha, the first
musical he directed. As the
scene ended the audience
was completely still for a full
minute. "Silence was my re
ward, because 1 knew I had
gotten to the audience. It's
gorgeous when you achieve

at Stanford, but she will prob
ably use her communication
major in public relations
work for the travel industry.
"I'm too chicken to try and
break my leg on Broadway.
But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get
braver," she says. She de
scribes her love for singing as
being one of the best ways of
expressing herself.
"So many people here are
multi-talented. The theatre is
a way of expression that's not
sitting behind a desk read
ing." According to Liza, it's
also a way of meeting a lot of
nice people here.
is a good
description of energetic mus

ical director Sam Spigelman.
A native of New York City,
Sam plans to return to the
East for medical school. Later
he wants a career as a pediat
rician.
"Music is my hobby, not
my profession," he says. At
Stanford Sam has musically
directed Man of La Mancha,
Gypsy and Fiddler on the
Roof. Being a pre-med and a
teaching assistant in the Biol
ogy Department hasn't kept
him from his music. Neither
will bec<»ming a doctor. "1
won't let it,"he says, "if you
use your time wisely you can
do it."
At rehearsals Sam is known
mostly as a comedian along
with his musical talents. Di
recting in stocking feet, beige
slacks and a silky dress shirt
with the sleeves rolled up,
Sammy feels each song with
his facial expressions. His
eyebrows portray every mood
change in the music. After
one song performed correctly
at a Fiddler rehearsal he
throws kisses at the cast, and
during another his Jewish ac
cent comes through with,
"Sweetness! Sweetness! You
gotta get on tune honey. . .
When at home in New
York, Sam is a frequent
theatre-goer. He doesn't think
Californians have much ex
posure to the theatre. But it is
clear that anyone in a show of
his leaves Stanford with a bet
ter appreciation of the musi
cal stage Sam loves so much.
of the students who
comprise the casts of dorm
shows have never been in a
production before. Tony
Brooke, a senior in the En

glish Department, had no
previous theatrical experi
ence before he was a chorus
member in Applause.
Thinking it would be fun to
learn the dances, Tony au
ditioned without a lot of ex
pectations. "I didn't think
there'd be so much rehearsing
for chorus parts. People in the
starring roles are the ones
most involved in the busy
work, like painting and build
ing sets," he says.
That separates Stanford
shows from professional
theatre, but there are other
differences. With the excep
tion of Ram's Head and the
Savoyards, most of the stu
dent and dorm shows are not
performed in theatres. Rather,
modifications and innova

people. A young man waiting
offstage leans against a wall,
Hi-liter in one hand and Re
naissance history book in the
other. Sitting in another part
of the room, a female student
intently studies graphs and
charts spread across a table,
ignoring the singing a few
feet away. Others have cal
culators with them for prob
lem sets.
Since everyone isn't always
on stage at once, rehearsal
time can be study time also.
The average student show re
quires about three hours of
time per night, three to four
nights per week. That is for
the first month-and-a-half of
rehearsing. In the two weeks
before a show opens, cast
members spend each night

'I'm too chicken to try and break my leg on
Broadway. But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get braver.'

tions are made to sets for their
effectiveness in a dining hall
or lounge.
A 20-foot staircase was
built for a Man of La Mancha
scene in Toyon three years
ago. It was re-used last year in
Gypsy. The platforms for the
ship in Anything Goes had to
be small enough to carry in
and out of Otero dining room
each night. And a chain link
fence was the only set needed
inGodspeJi there a year later.
Lights are usually hung on
poles suspended fitom the
ceiling.
During rehearsals, there's a
distinct characteristic that
sets Stanford's musical com
edians apart from other show

practicing for four hours or
more.
But when the lights go up
and the show begins, no one
is remembering all the hours
of work and loss of sleep from
late rehearsals. Besides, the
make-shift theatres are usu
ally packed to capacity. Ced
ro's musical Grease drew
standing room only audi
ences of 220 people each
night, and that was after 30 to
40 people in line were turned
away. With an even larger
hall, Toyon has had the same
situation the past two years
with Gypsy and The Music
Man. For Cabaret, an extra
11:30 p.m. performance was
added on the last night, and it
was filled.

The rise in dorm musical
drama has occurred over the
last four years, primarily in
undergraduate houses. Stu
dent audiences have been en
tertained by some of Broad
way's best musicals, includ
ing: Man of La Mancha, The
Music Man, Company, Fi
nian's Rainbow, Camelot,
You're a Good Man Charlie
Brown, Bye Bye Birdie, Any
thing Goes, The Fantasticks,
Gypsy, How to Succeed in
Business, Godspeli, Grease,
Cabaret, The Boyfriend,
Damn Yankees and Sweet
Charity.
Recent dorm plays have
been: J. 8., Don't Drink the
Water, You Can't Take it With
You, Inherit the Wind, The
Man Who Came to Dinner,
Plaza Suite, Charlie's Aunt,
TheCrucible, The Skin of Our
Teeth, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and Lion in
Winter.
Dorm productions are more
plentiful now. not only be
cause of so much enthusiasm,
but financial and technical
burdens have lessened in re
cent years. An average dorm
show costs about $300, ex
penses staying relatively low
since no hall has to be rented,
and in some cases royalties
are ignored. The Under
graduate Lighting Project
(ULP) rents some $9000
worth of equipment to stu
dent plays for only $1.25 per
light. (Free admission is
standard, although cast
members often plea for dona
tionsat the end of each show.)
Different people will give
you different explanations of
why all the interest in student
theatre exists at Stanford.
Common to most of the
school's musical comedians
though, is a desire to have a
good time, and to meet other
students outside the clas
sroom or library.
Aside from the experienced
having an opportunity to do
something they love, or the
inexperienced using their last
chance to do something
they'd been wanting to try,
the involvement here seems
to have even more of a special
attraction. Some call it the
"magic" of the theatre.
Norma Melloling, the
"dorm mama" and secretary
of Toyon Hall for seven years,
is the biggest fan of every
show performed there and
she defines the special attrac
tion as, "the fun of creating
something."
To put on a fantastic show
from zero, is to have a group
of people arrive simultane
ously at a goal, she says.
Stanford's musical come
dians are only one of several
groups on campus that help
keep students active with
each other. But they are a spe
cial group, as one can see
from their goal. While having
fun themselves they bring a
little theatrical magic into the
Stanford experience of those
who sit on a dormitory floor
to watch.

Stanford isn't the place to

for being unstructured and
free from academic pressures.
"For experienced people
it's a chance to do something

something like that you can
fit it into even the busiest

of the students who
comprise the casts of dorm
shows have never been in a
production before. Tony
Brooke, a senior in the En

glish Department, had no
previous theatrical experi
ence before he was a chorus
member in Applause.
Thinking it would be fun to
learn the dances, Tony au
ditioned without a lot of ex
pectations. "I didn't think
there'd be so much rehearsing
for chorus parts. People in the
starring roles are the ones
most involved in the busy
work, like painting and build
ing sets," he says.
That separates Stanford
shows from professional
theatre, but there are other
differences. With the excep

Savoyards, most of the stu

Hi-liter in one hand and Re

of the room, a female student
intently studies graphs and
charts spread across a table,
ignoring the singing a few
feet away. Others have cal
culators with them for prob
lem sets.
Since everyone isn't always
on stage at once, rehearsal
time can be study time also.
The average student show re
quires about three hours of
time per night, three to four
nights per week. That is for
the first month-and-a-half of
rehearsing. In the two weeks
before a show opens, cast
members spend each night

Broadway. But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get braver.'

tions are made to sets for their
effectiveness in a dining hall
or lounge.
A 20-foot staircase was
built for a Man of La Mancha
scene in Toyon three years
ago. It was re-used last year in
Gypsy. The platforms for the
ship in Anything Goes had to
be small enough to carry in
and out of Otero dining room
each night. And a chain link
fence was the only set needed
inGodspeJi there a year later.
Lights are usually hung on
poles suspended fitom the

During rehearsals, there's a
distinct characteristic that
sets Stanford's musical com
edians apart from other show

practicing for four hours or
more.
But when the lights go up
and the show begins, no one
is remembering all the hours
of work and loss of sleep from
late rehearsals. Besides, the
make-shift theatres are usu
ally packed to capacity. Ced
ro's musical Grease drew
standing room only audi
ences of 220 people each
night, and that was after 30 to
40 people in line were turned
away. With an even larger
hall, Toyon has had the same
situation the past two years
with Gypsy and The Music
Man. For Cabaret, an extra
11:30 p.m. performance was
added on the last night, and it
was filled.

The rise in dorm musical
drama has occurred over the
last four years, primarily in
undergraduate houses. Stu
dent audiences have been en
tertained by some of Broad
way's best musicals, includ
ing: Man of La Mancha, The
Music Man, Company, Fi
nian's Rainbow, Camelot,
You're a Good Man Charlie
Brown, Bye Bye Birdie, Any
thing Goes, The Fantasticks,
Gypsy, How to Succeed in
Business, Godspeli, Grease,
Cabaret, The Boyfriend,
Damn Yankees and Sweet
Charity.
Recent dorm plays have
been: J. 8., Don't Drink the
Water, You Can't Take it With
You, Inherit the Wind, The
Man Who Came to Dinner,
Plaza Suite, Charlie's Aunt,
TheCrucible, The Skin of Our
Teeth, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and Lion in
Winter.
Dorm productions are more
plentiful now. not only be
cause of so much enthusiasm,
but financial and technical
burdens have lessened in re
cent years. An average dorm
show costs about $300, ex
penses staying relatively low
since no hall has to be rented,
and in some cases royalties
are ignored. The Under
graduate Lighting Project
(ULP) rents some $9000
worth of equipment to stu
dent plays for only $1.25 per
light. (Free admission is
standard, although cast
members often plea for dona
tionsat the end of each show.)
Different people will give
you different explanations of
why all the interest in student
theatre exists at Stanford.
Common to most of the
school's musical comedians
though, is a desire to have a
good time, and to meet other
students outside the clas
sroom or library.
Aside from the experienced
having an opportunity to do
something they love, or the
inexperienced using their last
chance to do something
they'd been wanting to try,
the involvement here seems
to have even more of a special
attraction. Some call it the
"magic" of the theatre.
Norma Melloling, the
"dorm mama" and secretary
of Toyon Hall for seven years,
is the biggest fan of every
show performed there and
she defines the special attrac
tion as, "the fun of creating
something."
To put on a fantastic show
from zero, is to have a group
of people arrive simultane
ously at a goal, she says.
Stanford's musical come
dians are only one of several
groups on campus that help
keep students active with
each other. But they are a spe
cial group, as one can see
from their goal. While having
fun themselves they bring a
little theatrical magic into the
Stanford experience of those
who sit on a dormitory floor
to watch.

As an economics and
communication double
major, he hopes to attend a
law school like N.Y.U. His fu
ture plans are for some ki nd of
corporate law or legal work

Doug's performing career
began with a role in The
Mikado at age 10. and has
been a hobby ever since. "I'm
a ham from way back," he
says, and explains that any
one in the theatre does it as a
way of getting attention.
Stanford isn't the place to

but he praises "dorm drama"
for being unstructured and
free from academic pressures.
"For experienced people
it's a chance to do something
they love, and when you love
something like that you can
fit it into even the busiest
schedule," he says. For those
without theatrical experience
it is a good chance to do some

contact with the audience,

least eight major Broadway
musicals will have been pre
sented by independent stu
dent groups and dormitories.
The students involved are for
the most part not drama or
music majors and they re
ceive no academic credit for
their participation. Although
by day they are preparing to
be successful doctors,
lawyers or politicians of the
future, at night these students
are Stanford's musical come
dians.
At a university known
chiefly for its academic repu
tation, the amount of interest
in the musical stage might
seem unusual. One could ex
pect students here to have
their minds geared only to
ward studies and graduate
school futures, with weekend
social activities for relaxa
tion.
With quite a few people,
today this is not the case, nor
has it been true of Stanford's
past. From the March, 1908,
Stanford Alumnus: "One of
the leading phases of Stan
ford social life is the interest
manifested in its dramatic
world . . . where there are
forces at work to draw out the
best efforts that a college
community possesses there is
very apt to be unusual ability
discovered and fostered."
The forces at work in Doug
Bedard's theatrical career at
Stanford have been Toyon
Hall, the Savoyards and
Ram's Head. The abilities this
senior from San Jose has de
veloped here have been in
performing and directing. At
Stanford Doug has directed
Don't Drink the Water, Man of
La Mancha, Gypsy, The USA,
and he produced Fiddler on
the Roof. He has had leading
roles here in J. 8., The Music
Man, 7'he Mikado, Applause,
and recently performed King
Henry II in Lion in Winter at
Toyon.
A five-foot-nine inch build,
dimpled chin and pointed
nose do not give him a
stereotypical "star" appear

thing they'd like to try.
Having been both an actor
and director here, Doug finds
directing more difficult. The
student director has to deal
with all levels of talent and aIL
types of people. "It's really
hard to be a peer director," he
explains, "you've got to be a
psychoanalyst too."
But the rewards of direct
ing are well worth the time
and patience, he believes. He
tells of a moving scene from
Man of La Mancha, the first
musical he directed. As the
scene ended the audience
was completely still for a full
minute. "Silence was my re
ward, because 1 knew I had
gotten to the audience. It's
gorgeous when you achieve

ably use her communication
major in public relations
work for the travel industry.
"I'm too chicken to try and
break my leg on Broadway.
But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get
braver," she says. She de
scribes her love for singing as
being one of the best ways of
expressing herself.
"So many people here are
multi-talented. The theatre is
a way of expression that's not
sitting behind a desk read
ing." According to Liza, it's
also a way of meeting a lot of
nice people here.

description of energetic mus

ical director Sam Spigelman.
A native of New York City,
Sam plans to return to the
East for medical school. Later
he wants a career as a pediat
rician.
"Music is my hobby, not
my profession," he says. At
Stanford Sam has musically
directed Man of La Mancha,
Gypsy and Fiddler on the
Roof. Being a pre-med and a
teaching assistant in the Biol
ogy Department hasn't kept
him from his music. Neither
will bec<»ming a doctor. "1
won't let it,"he says, "if you
use your time wisely you can
do it."
At rehearsals Sam is known
mostly as a comedian along
with his musical talents. Di
recting in stocking feet, beige
slacks and a silky dress shirt
with the sleeves rolled up,
Sammy feels each song with
his facial expressions. His
eyebrows portray every mood
change in the music. After
one song performed correctly
at a Fiddler rehearsal he
throws kisses at the cast, and
during another his Jewish ac
cent comes through with,
"Sweetness! Sweetness! You
gotta get on tune honey. . .
When at home in New

been: J. 8., Don't Drink the
Water, You Can't Take it With
You, Inherit the Wind, The
Man Who Came to Dinner,
Plaza Suite, Charlie's Aunt,
TheCrucible, The Skin of Our
Teeth, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and Lion in
Winter.
Dorm productions are more
plentiful now. not only be
cause of so much enthusiasm,
but financial and technical
burdens have lessened in re
cent years. An average dorm
show costs about $300, ex
penses staying relatively low
since no hall has to be rented,
and in some cases royalties
are ignored. The Under
graduate Lighting Project
(ULP) rents some $9000
worth of equipment to stu
dent plays for only $1.25 per
light. (Free admission is
standard, although cast
members often plea for dona
tionsat the end of each show.)
Different people will give
you different explanations of
why all the interest in student
theatre exists at Stanford.
Common to most of the
school's musical comedians
though, is a desire to have a
good time, and to meet other
students outside the clas
sroom or library.
Aside from the experienced
having an opportunity to do
something they love, or the
inexperienced using their last
chance to do something
they'd been wanting to try,
the involvement here seems
to have even more of a special
attraction. Some call it the
"magic" of the theatre.
Norma Melloling, the
"dorm mama" and secretary
of Toyon Hall for seven years,
is the biggest fan of every
show performed there and
she defines the special attrac
tion as, "the fun of creating
something."
To put on a fantastic show
from zero, is to have a group
of people arrive simultane
ously at a goal, she says.
Stanford's musical come
dians are only one of several
groups on campus that help
keep students active with
each other. But they are a spe
cial group, as one can see
from their goal. While having
fun themselves they bring a
little theatrical magic into the
Stanford experience of those
who sit on a dormitory floor
to watch.

several of Stanford's dining

trying to achieve stardom. "I
won't go into the theatre for
employment," he says, "it's
too hard to become a star now
and it's really not worth be
coming anything else."
As an economics and
communication double
major, he hopes to attend a
law school like N.Y.U. His fu
ture plans are for some ki nd of
corporate law or legal work
for a theatrical production
company.
Doug's performing career
began with a role in The
Mikado at age 10. and has
been a hobby ever since. "I'm
a ham from way back," he
says, and explains that any
one in the theatre does it as a
way of getting attention.
Stanford isn't the place to
come for drama he admits,
but he praises "dorm drama"
for being unstructured and
free from academic pressures.
"For experienced people
it's a chance to do something
they love, and when you love
something like that you can
fit it into even the busiest
schedule," he says. For those
without theatrical experience
it is a good chance to do some

contact with the audience,
making them feel what I feel
about a scene or a show —
that's my reward."

Last year, the star of Gypsy,
she was recently Golde in

a heavier figure and

least eight major Broadway
musicals will have been pre
sented by independent stu
dent groups and dormitories.
The students involved are for
the most part not drama or
music majors and they re
ceive no academic credit for
their participation. Although
by day they are preparing to
be successful doctors,
lawyers or politicians of the
future, at night these students
are Stanford's musical come
dians.
At a university known
chiefly for its academic repu
tation, the amount of interest
in the musical stage might
seem unusual. One could ex
pect students here to have
their minds geared only to
ward studies and graduate
school futures, with weekend
social activities for relaxa
tion.
With quite a few people,
today this is not the case, nor
has it been true of Stanford's
past. From the March, 1908,
Stanford Alumnus: "One of
the leading phases of Stan
ford social life is the interest
manifested in its dramatic
world . . . where there are
forces at work to draw out the
best efforts that a college
community possesses there is
very apt to be unusual ability
discovered and fostered."
The forces at work in Doug
Bedard's theatrical career at
Stanford have been Toyon
Hall, the Savoyards and
Ram's Head. The abilities this
senior from San Jose has de
veloped here have been in
performing and directing. At
Stanford Doug has directed
Don't Drink the Water, Man of
La Mancha, Gypsy, The USA,
and he produced Fiddler on
the Roof. He has had leading
roles here in J. 8., The Music
Man, 7'he Mikado, Applause,
and recently performed King
Henry II in Lion in Winter at
Toyon.
A five-foot-nine inch build,
dimpled chin and pointed
nose do not give him a
stereotypical "star" appear

thing they'd like to try.
Having been both an actor
and director here, Doug finds
directing more difficult. The
student director has to deal
with all levels of talent and aIL
types of people. "It's really
hard to be a peer director," he
explains, "you've got to be a
psychoanalyst too."
But the rewards of direct
ing are well worth the time
and patience, he believes. He
tells of a moving scene from
Man of La Mancha, the first
musical he directed. As the
scene ended the audience
was completely still for a full
minute. "Silence was my re
ward, because 1 knew I had
gotten to the audience. It's
gorgeous when you achieve

at Stanford, but she will prob
ably use her communication
major in public relations
work for the travel industry.
"I'm too chicken to try and
break my leg on Broadway.
But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get
braver," she says. She de
scribes her love for singing as
being one of the best ways of
expressing herself.
"So many people here are
multi-talented. The theatre is
a way of expression that's not
sitting behind a desk read
ing." According to Liza, it's
also a way of meeting a lot of
nice people here.
is a good
description of energetic mus

ical director Sam Spigelman.
A native of New York City,
Sam plans to return to the
East for medical school. Later
he wants a career as a pediat
rician.
"Music is my hobby, not
my profession," he says. At
Stanford Sam has musically
directed Man of La Mancha,
Gypsy and Fiddler on the
Roof. Being a pre-med and a
teaching assistant in the Biol
ogy Department hasn't kept
him from his music. Neither
will bec<»ming a doctor. "1
won't let it,"he says, "if you
use your time wisely you can
do it."
At rehearsals Sam is known
mostly as a comedian along
with his musical talents. Di
recting in stocking feet, beige
slacks and a silky dress shirt
with the sleeves rolled up,
Sammy feels each song with
his facial expressions. His
eyebrows portray every mood
change in the music. After
one song performed correctly
at a Fiddler rehearsal he
throws kisses at the cast, and
during another his Jewish ac
cent comes through with,
"Sweetness! Sweetness! You
gotta get on tune honey. . .
When at home in New
York, Sam is a frequent
theatre-goer. He doesn't think
Californians have much ex
posure to the theatre. But it is
clear that anyone in a show of
his leaves Stanford with a bet
ter appreciation of the musi
cal stage Sam loves so much.
of the students who
comprise the casts of dorm
shows have never been in a
production before. Tony
Brooke, a senior in the En

glish Department, had no
previous theatrical experi
ence before he was a chorus
member in Applause.
Thinking it would be fun to
learn the dances, Tony au
ditioned without a lot of ex
pectations. "I didn't think
there'd be so much rehearsing
for chorus parts. People in the
starring roles are the ones
most involved in the busy
work, like painting and build
ing sets," he says.
That separates Stanford
shows from professional
theatre, but there are other
differences. With the excep
tion of Ram's Head and the
Savoyards, most of the stu
dent and dorm shows are not
performed in theatres. Rather,
modifications and innova

people. A young man waiting
offstage leans against a wall,
Hi-liter in one hand and Re
naissance history book in the
other. Sitting in another part
of the room, a female student
intently studies graphs and
charts spread across a table,
ignoring the singing a few
feet away. Others have cal
culators with them for prob
lem sets.
Since everyone isn't always
on stage at once, rehearsal
time can be study time also.
The average student show re
quires about three hours of
time per night, three to four
nights per week. That is for
the first month-and-a-half of
rehearsing. In the two weeks
before a show opens, cast
members spend each night

'I'm too chicken to try and break my leg on
Broadway. But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get braver.'

tions are made to sets for their
effectiveness in a dining hall
or lounge.
A 20-foot staircase was
built for a Man of La Mancha
scene in Toyon three years
ago. It was re-used last year in
Gypsy. The platforms for the
ship in Anything Goes had to
be small enough to carry in
and out of Otero dining room
each night. And a chain link
fence was the only set needed
inGodspeJi there a year later.
Lights are usually hung on
poles suspended fitom the
ceiling.
During rehearsals, there's a
distinct characteristic that
sets Stanford's musical com
edians apart from other show

practicing for four hours or
more.
But when the lights go up
and the show begins, no one
is remembering all the hours
of work and loss of sleep from
late rehearsals. Besides, the
make-shift theatres are usu
ally packed to capacity. Ced
ro's musical Grease drew
standing room only audi
ences of 220 people each
night, and that was after 30 to
40 people in line were turned
away. With an even larger
hall, Toyon has had the same
situation the past two years
with Gypsy and The Music
Man. For Cabaret, an extra
11:30 p.m. performance was
added on the last night, and it
was filled.

The rise in dorm musical
drama has occurred over the
last four years, primarily in
undergraduate houses. Stu
dent audiences have been en
tertained by some of Broad
way's best musicals, includ
ing: Man of La Mancha, The
Music Man, Company, Fi
nian's Rainbow, Camelot,
You're a Good Man Charlie
Brown, Bye Bye Birdie, Any
thing Goes, The Fantasticks,
Gypsy, How to Succeed in
Business, Godspeli, Grease,
Cabaret, The Boyfriend,
Damn Yankees and Sweet
Charity.

least eight major Broadway
musicals will have been pre
sented by independent stu
dent groups and dormitories.
The students involved are for
the most part not drama or
music majors and they re
ceive no academic credit for
their participation. Although
by day they are preparing to
be successful doctors,
lawyers or politicians of the
future, at night these students
are Stanford's musical come
dians.
At a university known
chiefly for its academic repu
tation, the amount of interest
in the musical stage might
seem unusual. One could ex
pect students here to have
their minds geared only to
ward studies and graduate
school futures, with weekend
social activities for relaxa
tion.
With quite a few people,
today this is not the case, nor
has it been true of Stanford's
past. From the March, 1908,
Stanford Alumnus: "One of
the leading phases of Stan
ford social life is the interest
manifested in its dramatic
world . . . where there are
forces at work to draw out the
best efforts that a college
community possesses there is
very apt to be unusual ability
discovered and fostered."
The forces at work in Doug
Bedard's theatrical career at
Stanford have been Toyon
Hall, the Savoyards and
Ram's Head. The abilities this
senior from San Jose has de
veloped here have been in
performing and directing. At
Stanford Doug has directed
Don't Drink the Water, Man of
La Mancha, Gypsy, The USA,
and he produced Fiddler on
the Roof. He has had leading
roles here in J. 8., The Music
Man, 7'he Mikado, Applause,
and recently performed King
Henry II in Lion in Winter at
Toyon.
A five-foot-nine inch build,
dimpled chin and pointed
nose do not give him a
stereotypical "star" appear

thing they'd like to try.
Having been both an actor
and director here, Doug finds
directing more difficult. The
student director has to deal
with all levels of talent and aIL
types of people. "It's really
hard to be a peer director," he
explains, "you've got to be a
psychoanalyst too."
But the rewards of direct
ing are well worth the time
and patience, he believes. He
tells of a moving scene from
Man of La Mancha, the first
musical he directed. As the
scene ended the audience
was completely still for a full
minute. "Silence was my re
ward, because 1 knew I had
gotten to the audience. It's
gorgeous when you achieve

at Stanford, but she will prob
ably use her communication
major in public relations
work for the travel industry.
"I'm too chicken to try and
break my leg on Broadway.
But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get
braver," she says. She de
scribes her love for singing as
being one of the best ways of
expressing herself.
"So many people here are
multi-talented. The theatre is
a way of expression that's not
sitting behind a desk read
ing." According to Liza, it's
also a way of meeting a lot of
nice people here.
is a good
description of energetic mus

ical director Sam Spigelman.
A native of New York City,
Sam plans to return to the
East for medical school. Later
he wants a career as a pediat
rician.
"Music is my hobby, not
my profession," he says. At
Stanford Sam has musically
directed Man of La Mancha,
Gypsy and Fiddler on the
Roof. Being a pre-med and a
teaching assistant in the Biol
ogy Department hasn't kept
him from his music. Neither
will bec<»ming a doctor. "1
won't let it,"he says, "if you
use your time wisely you can
do it."
At rehearsals Sam is known
mostly as a comedian along
with his musical talents. Di
recting in stocking feet, beige
slacks and a silky dress shirt
with the sleeves rolled up,
Sammy feels each song with
his facial expressions. His
eyebrows portray every mood
change in the music. After
one song performed correctly
at a Fiddler rehearsal he
throws kisses at the cast, and
during another his Jewish ac
cent comes through with,
"Sweetness! Sweetness! You
gotta get on tune honey. . .
When at home in New
York, Sam is a frequent
theatre-goer. He doesn't think
Californians have much ex
posure to the theatre. But it is
clear that anyone in a show of
his leaves Stanford with a bet
ter appreciation of the musi
cal stage Sam loves so much.
of the students who
comprise the casts of dorm
shows have never been in a
production before. Tony
Brooke, a senior in the En

glish Department, had no
previous theatrical experi
ence before he was a chorus
member in Applause.
Thinking it would be fun to
learn the dances, Tony au
ditioned without a lot of ex
pectations. "I didn't think
there'd be so much rehearsing
for chorus parts. People in the
starring roles are the ones
most involved in the busy
work, like painting and build
ing sets," he says.
That separates Stanford
shows from professional
theatre, but there are other
differences. With the excep
tion of Ram's Head and the
Savoyards, most of the stu
dent and dorm shows are not
performed in theatres. Rather,
modifications and innova

people. A young man waiting
offstage leans against a wall,
Hi-liter in one hand and Re
naissance history book in the
other. Sitting in another part
of the room, a female student
intently studies graphs and
charts spread across a table,
ignoring the singing a few
feet away. Others have cal
culators with them for prob
lem sets.
Since everyone isn't always
on stage at once, rehearsal
time can be study time also.
The average student show re
quires about three hours of
time per night, three to four
nights per week. That is for
the first month-and-a-half of
rehearsing. In the two weeks
before a show opens, cast
members spend each night

'I'm too chicken to try and break my leg on
Broadway. But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get braver.'

tions are made to sets for their
effectiveness in a dining hall
or lounge.
A 20-foot staircase was
built for a Man of La Mancha
scene in Toyon three years
ago. It was re-used last year in
Gypsy. The platforms for the
ship in Anything Goes had to
be small enough to carry in
and out of Otero dining room
each night. And a chain link
fence was the only set needed
inGodspeJi there a year later.
Lights are usually hung on
poles suspended fitom the
ceiling.
During rehearsals, there's a
distinct characteristic that
sets Stanford's musical com
edians apart from other show

practicing for four hours or
more.
But when the lights go up
and the show begins, no one
is remembering all the hours
of work and loss of sleep from
late rehearsals. Besides, the
make-shift theatres are usu
ally packed to capacity. Ced
ro's musical Grease drew
standing room only audi
ences of 220 people each
night, and that was after 30 to
40 people in line were turned
away. With an even larger
hall, Toyon has had the same
situation the past two years
with Gypsy and The Music
Man. For Cabaret, an extra
11:30 p.m. performance was
added on the last night, and it
was filled.

The rise in dorm musical
drama has occurred over the
last four years, primarily in
undergraduate houses. Stu
dent audiences have been en
tertained by some of Broad
way's best musicals, includ
ing: Man of La Mancha, The
Music Man, Company, Fi
nian's Rainbow, Camelot,
You're a Good Man Charlie
Brown, Bye Bye Birdie, Any
thing Goes, The Fantasticks,
Gypsy, How to Succeed in
Business, Godspeli, Grease,
Cabaret, The Boyfriend,
Damn Yankees and Sweet
Charity.
Recent dorm plays have
been: J. 8., Don't Drink the
Water, You Can't Take it With
You, Inherit the Wind, The
Man Who Came to Dinner,
Plaza Suite, Charlie's Aunt,
TheCrucible, The Skin of Our
Teeth, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and Lion in
Winter.
Dorm productions are more
plentiful now. not only be
cause of so much enthusiasm,
but financial and technical
burdens have lessened in re
cent years. An average dorm
show costs about $300, ex
penses staying relatively low
since no hall has to be rented,
and in some cases royalties
are ignored. The Under
graduate Lighting Project
(ULP) rents some $9000
worth of equipment to stu
dent plays for only $1.25 per
light. (Free admission is
standard, although cast
members often plea for dona
tionsat the end of each show.)
Different people will give
you different explanations of
why all the interest in student
theatre exists at Stanford.
Common to most of the
school's musical comedians
though, is a desire to have a
good time, and to meet other
students outside the clas
sroom or library.
Aside from the experienced
having an opportunity to do
something they love, or the
inexperienced using their last
chance to do something
they'd been wanting to try,
the involvement here seems
to have even more of a special
attraction. Some call it the
"magic" of the theatre.
Norma Melloling, the
"dorm mama" and secretary
of Toyon Hall for seven years,
is the biggest fan of every
show performed there and
she defines the special attrac
tion as, "the fun of creating
something."
To put on a fantastic show
from zero, is to have a group
of people arrive simultane
ously at a goal, she says.
Stanford's musical come
dians are only one of several
groups on campus that help
keep students active with
each other. But they are a spe
cial group, as one can see
from their goal. While having
fun themselves they bring a
little theatrical magic into the
Stanford experience of those
who sit on a dormitory floor
to watch.

is a good
description of energetic mus

ical director Sam Spigelman.
A native of New York City,
Sam plans to return to the
East for medical school. Later
he wants a career as a pediat
rician.
"Music is my hobby, not
my profession," he says. At
Stanford Sam has musically
directed Man of La Mancha,
Gypsy and Fiddler on the
Roof. Being a pre-med and a
teaching assistant in the Biol
ogy Department hasn't kept
him from his music. Neither
will bec<»ming a doctor. "1
won't let it,"he says, "if you
use your time wisely you can
do it."
At rehearsals Sam is known
mostly as a comedian along
with his musical talents. Di
recting in stocking feet, beige
slacks and a silky dress shirt
with the sleeves rolled up,
Sammy feels each song with
his facial expressions. His
eyebrows portray every mood
change in the music. After
one song performed correctly
at a Fiddler rehearsal he
throws kisses at the cast, and
during another his Jewish ac
cent comes through with,
"Sweetness! Sweetness! You
gotta get on tune honey. . .
When at home in New
York, Sam is a frequent
theatre-goer. He doesn't think
Californians have much ex
posure to the theatre. But it is
clear that anyone in a show of
his leaves Stanford with a bet
ter appreciation of the musi
cal stage Sam loves so much.
of the students who
comprise the casts of dorm
shows have never been in a
production before. Tony
Brooke, a senior in the En

glish Department, had no
previous theatrical experi
ence before he was a chorus
member in Applause.
Thinking it would be fun to
learn the dances, Tony au
ditioned without a lot of ex
pectations. "I didn't think
there'd be so much rehearsing
for chorus parts. People in the
starring roles are the ones
most involved in the busy
work, like painting and build
ing sets," he says.
That separates Stanford
shows from professional
theatre, but there are other
differences. With the excep
tion of Ram's Head and the
Savoyards, most of the stu
dent and dorm shows are not
performed in theatres. Rather,
modifications and innova

people. A young man waiting
offstage leans against a wall,
Hi-liter in one hand and Re
naissance history book in the
other. Sitting in another part
of the room, a female student
intently studies graphs and
charts spread across a table,
ignoring the singing a few
feet away. Others have cal
culators with them for prob
lem sets.
Since everyone isn't always
on stage at once, rehearsal
time can be study time also.
The average student show re
quires about three hours of
time per night, three to four
nights per week. That is for
the first month-and-a-half of
rehearsing. In the two weeks
before a show opens, cast
members spend each night

'I'm too chicken to try and break my leg on
Broadway. But I'll always sing, and
maybe someday I'll get braver.'

tions are made to sets for their
effectiveness in a dining hall
or lounge.
A 20-foot staircase was
built for a Man of La Mancha
scene in Toyon three years
ago. It was re-used last year in
Gypsy. The platforms for the
ship in Anything Goes had to
be small enough to carry in
and out of Otero dining room
each night. And a chain link
fence was the only set needed
inGodspeJi there a year later.
Lights are usually hung on
poles suspended fitom the
ceiling.
During rehearsals, there's a
distinct characteristic that
sets Stanford's musical com
edians apart from other show

practicing for four hours or
more.
But when the lights go up
and the show begins, no one
is remembering all the hours
of work and loss of sleep from
late rehearsals. Besides, the
make-shift theatres are usu
ally packed to capacity. Ced
ro's musical Grease drew
standing room only audi
ences of 220 people each
night, and that was after 30 to
40 people in line were turned
away. With an even larger
hall, Toyon has had the same
situation the past two years
with Gypsy and The Music
Man. For Cabaret, an extra
11:30 p.m. performance was
added on the last night, and it
was filled.

The rise in dorm musical
drama has occurred over the
last four years, primarily in
undergraduate houses. Stu
dent audiences have been en
tertained by some of Broad
way's best musicals, includ
ing: Man of La Mancha, The
Music Man, Company, Fi
nian's Rainbow, Camelot,
You're a Good Man Charlie
Brown, Bye Bye Birdie, Any
thing Goes, The Fantasticks,
Gypsy, How to Succeed in
Business, Godspeli, Grease,
Cabaret, The Boyfriend,
Damn Yankees and Sweet
Charity.
Recent dorm plays have
been: J. 8., Don't Drink the
Water, You Can't Take it With
You, Inherit the Wind, The
Man Who Came to Dinner,
Plaza Suite, Charlie's Aunt,
TheCrucible, The Skin of Our
Teeth, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and Lion in
Winter.
Dorm productions are more
plentiful now. not only be
cause of so much enthusiasm,
but financial and technical
burdens have lessened in re
cent years. An average dorm
show costs about $300, ex
penses staying relatively low
since no hall has to be rented,
and in some cases royalties
are ignored. The Under
graduate Lighting Project
(ULP) rents some $9000
worth of equipment to stu
dent plays for only $1.25 per
light. (Free admission is
standard, although cast
members often plea for dona
tionsat the end of each show.)
Different people will give
you different explanations of
why all the interest in student
theatre exists at Stanford.
Common to most of the
school's musical comedians
though, is a desire to have a
good time, and to meet other
students outside the clas
sroom or library.
Aside from the experienced
having an opportunity to do
something they love, or the
inexperienced using their last
chance to do something
they'd been wanting to try,
the involvement here seems
to have even more of a special
attraction. Some call it the
"magic" of the theatre.
Norma Melloling, the
"dorm mama" and secretary
of Toyon Hall for seven years,
is the biggest fan of every
show performed there and
she defines the special attrac
tion as, "the fun of creating
something."
To put on a fantastic show
from zero, is to have a group
of people arrive simultane
ously at a goal, she says.
Stanford's musical come
dians are only one of several
groups on campus that help
keep students active with
each other. But they are a spe
cial group, as one can see
from their goal. While having
fun themselves they bring a
little theatrical magic into the
Stanford experience of those
who sit on a dormitory floor
to watch.

JL he melody line of "Sunrise
Sunset" bangs out from the
slightly out-of-tune piano. "I
need more tenor, don't forget
to watch me for dynamic
cues," snaps the musical di
rector. The singers start
again: "Sunrise, sunset, sun
rise, sunset, swiftly flow the
days. . .
Nearby, six young women
in leotards and tights are high
kicking and tapping through
one of Cabaret's nightclub
dance numbers. "Five six
seven eight, kick, two three,
step, turn turn, arms out!"
Down the hall a director
shouts, "Okay let's take the
Margo-Bill scene one more
time," during a dress rehear
sal tor Applause.
And across the street an or
chestra rock 'n rolls a fifties
medley, the lights go up, and
10 actors dance onto the stage
for the opening night of
Grease.
It was a Thursday evening.
The place — Broadway's
theatre district in New York
City? No, this all happened in
several of Stanford's dining
halls and dormitory lounges.
This year at Stanford at

ance. But Doug Bedard is riot
trying to achieve stardom. "I
won't go into the theatre for
employment," he says, "it's
too hard to become a star now
and it's really not worth be
coming anything else."
As an economics and
communication double
major, he hopes to attend a
law school like N.Y.U. His fu
ture plans are for some ki nd of
corporate law or legal work
for a theatrical production
company.
Doug's performing career
began with a role in The
Mikado at age 10. and has
been a hobby ever since. "I'm
a ham from way back," he
says, and explains that any
one in the theatre does it as a
way of getting attention.
Stanford isn't the place to
come for drama he admits,
but he praises "dorm drama"
for being unstructured and
free from academic pressures.
"For experienced people
it's a chance to do something
they love, and when you love
something like that you can
fit it into even the busiest
schedule," he says. For those
without theatrical experience
it is a good chance to do some

contact with the audience,
making them feel what I feel
about a scene or a show —
that's my reward."
.A.nother of Stanford's ex
perienced musical come
dians is senior Liza Kinsell.
Last year, the star of Gypsy,
she was recently Golde in
Fiddler on the Hoof. With a
big Jimmy Carter smile, she
squints and recalls sitting on
her swing set as a child, dying
to be "Funny Girl." She even
has Streisand's nose, but the
resemblance ends there, with
a heavier figure and
shoulder-length blonde hair.
Liza's singing and dramatic
background during high
school led her to involvement

'For experienced people it's a chance to do something they
love, and when you love something like that you can fit it into
even the busiest schedule.'

least eight major Broadway
musicals will have been pre
sented by independent stu
dent groups and dormitories.
The students involved are for
the most part not drama or
music majors and they re
ceive no academic credit for
their participation. Although
by day they are preparing to
be successful doctors,
lawyers or politicians of the
future, at night these students
are Stanford's musical come
dians.
At a university known
chiefly for its academic repu
tation, the amount of interest
in the musical stage might
seem unusual. One could ex
pect students here to have
their minds geared only to
ward studies and graduate
school futures, with weekend
social activities for relaxa
tion.
With quite a few people,
today this is not the case, nor
has it been true of Stanford's
past. From the March, 1908,
Stanford Alumnus: "One of
the leading phases of Stan
ford social life is the interest
manifested in its dramatic
world . . . where there are
forces at work to draw out the
best efforts that a college
community possesses there is
very apt to be unusual ability
discovered and fostered."
The forces at work in Doug
Bedard's theatrical career at
Stanford have been Toyon
Hall, the Savoyards and
Ram's Head. The abilities this
senior from San Jose has de
veloped here have been in
performing and directing. At
Stanford Doug has directed
Don't Drink the Water, Man of
La Mancha, Gypsy, The USA,
and he produced Fiddler on
the Roof. He has had leading
roles here in J. 8., The Music
Man, 7'he Mikado, Applause,
and recently performed King
Henry II in Lion in Winter at
Toyon.
A five-foot-nine inch build,
dimpled chin and pointed
nose do not give him a
stereotypical "star" appear

thing they'd like to try.
Having been both an actor
and director here, Doug finds
directing more difficult. The
student director has to deal
with all levels of talent and aIL
types of people. "It's really
hard to be a peer director," he
explains, "you've got to be a
psychoanalyst too."
But the rewards of direct
ing are well worth the time
and patience, he believes. He
tells of a moving scene from
Man of La Mancha, the first
musical he directed. As the
scene ended the audience
was completely still for a full
minute. "Silence was my re
