# For frats, special priority houses
## Optional RAs called for in petition 
### Bill Wien 
A petition has been circulated here
calling for optional rather than man
datory house associates (RA) resi
dency in fraternities and special prior
ity houses.
Circulated by David Schreiber,
former house manager of Phi Delta
Theta, the petition focuses primarily
on the "waste of financial expenditure
and manpower" incurred as a result of
having an RA. It also proposes inde
pendent houses be permitted to elect a
house president or social chairman to
replace the RA.
As of Friday, the petition had 24 sig
natures.
RAs have traditionally been pro
vided for the purpose of counseling
and advising, programming events
and handling various administrative
duties.

Tom Hornbeak, assistant director of
the Row, criticized the recommenda
tion to have house presidents take over
RA responsibilities.
He said, "It's difficult for a peer
group member of the fraternity to
change roles to that of an RA adviser —
it's not impossible, but difficult."
Hornbeak deferred from more
explicit comment on the proposal but
added, "If we're not getting the RAs
that do the job, I'd say we're in for some
heavy review.
"There have been occasions when
we have made another assignment to a
house not only because of present stu
dent complaints. A good RA will be
well received in a house. But un aver
age RA is not going to last because
students set high standards here for
themselves and other people," he said
According to Brad Krevoy, member
of Zeta Psi, the issue is whether or not
the house should have residential
education and "that should be decided
within the house," he says.
Officers run house
"House officers generally take on
the responsibility of running the house
— they are the ones keeping order in
the house and who have contact with
the housing office. So in this respect
the RA is a figurehead," Krevoy said.
"Residential education is flowing in
the fraternities this year as much as the
water in Lake Lagunita," Krevoy ad
ded.
The 'controversy over mandatory
RAs stems in part from the inception of
the Budget Equilibrium Program
(BEP), Hornbeak indicated.
When the BEP came into effect one
of its themes was that "each auxiliary
service be as self-sufficient as possible,
that is, people who receive the services
should pay for them," Hornbeak said.
Before BEP
Prior to the inception of the BEP in
1974, any "field costs," which include
salaries for resident staff, financing for
local residence offices and program
funds, were paid for from room and
board and a general fund from tuition
money and endowments.
Now, however, all residential edu
cation expenses are funded solely by
room and board fees.
Part of this money goes into RAs'

salaries and a program fund, set up at
the Row Office, to support residential
educational activities.
Schreiber said fraternities would
feel better about their fees if they took
advantage of this fund.
"I think the problem is that people
don't realize this fund exists, espe
cially house presidents," said
Schreiber. He attributes this problem
to a lack of communication between
house presidents and RAs.
$5000 per year
The residential education fund is
$5000 per year, Schreiber said. But "al
though the fraternity houses a substan
tial port ion of t he Row population t hey
only use? 10 >er cent of that fund
($500)," Schreiber said
"This year," says Hornbeak, "about
one-third of residential education ex
penses were allocated to the Food Ser
vice." Until this fiscal year 1976-77,
independent houses which did not
subscribe to the Food Service were not
assigned this cost, nor were any other
residences.
"In retrospect, general residential
education expenses should never have
been shifted to include Food Service at
all," said Ed Scoles, director of hous
ing. This was done only for this fiscal
year and has been corrected for 1977-
78, he noted.
Residential education study
During Winter Quarter, a group of
students and staff, with fraternity rep
resentation, reviewed the allocation of
residential education fees before send
ing recommendations to Scoles and
Norm Robinson, acting dean of stu
dents.
One of the students involved in the
review, Randy Barnes, a member of
Theta Delta Chi, stated, "There are
charges made to the University Food
Service which we tried to apportion to
all students regardless of whether they
were on the food service or not."
This decision is in line with the gen
eral trend toward including expenses
in all residences in a cost pool. For
example, several fraternities which
used to pay for their own trash pick-up
and electricity now share this cost
with other residences.
The cost-pool system applies to RAs
in fraternity and special priority
houses, said Barnes. "If RAs are made
optional and the current system of

rents prevails, then the cost per stu
dent in the independent houses will
not decline by the entire amount of '..he
residential charge."
Members of fraternity and indepen
dent houses have argued that their
houses are in fact independent and
that they should not have an RA on a
mandatory basis.
Robinson disagrees that houses can
be termed independent because "they
are on University land and in terms of
educational benefit who owns the
house is irrelevant."
He also considers RAs employes of
the University. "We're talking about a
job and my feeling is that you talk
about people who are qualified to hold
them. University staff members are
hired not elected and receive a salary
for what they do."
In any case, Robinson expects the
RA subject to arise "year after year."
