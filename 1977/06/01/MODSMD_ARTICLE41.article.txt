# Slave photos found
## 
### 
Cambridge, Mass. (AP) — The
white archivist who found the
oldest known identified photos
of black slaves in the United
States said yesterday she felt un
comfortable about the nude pic
tures and wondered "If these
were my ancestors, would I want
them to be seen this way?"
The pictures, daguerreotypes
made in 1850 in Columbia, S.C.,
for scientific study, are being
published for the first time in the
june issue of American Heritage
magazine.
Eighteen months ago, Elinor
Reichlin, 47, found 36 of the
photos in an otherwise empty
cabinet in an attic in Harvard
University's Peabody Museum.
'Terrified'
"I'm sort of terrified," said
Reichlin, who since has left the
museum. "1 just have this feel
ing. I'm not queasy. But 1 wonder
if it is perhaps not decent.

"The pictures should encour
age people to track down their
ancestors," she said. "But it may
be a two-edged sword.
"The circumstances under
which the photos were made
were degrading. I don't feel quite
comfortable about them," she
said.
Prof. Stephen Williams, direc
tor of the Peabody Museum, said
the photographs were the oldest
examples of rare pictures of
American slaves born in Africa.
Identification
At least four of the seven sub
jects taken in several poses were
identified on the prints by first
name, African country or tribe of
origin, and by owner.
Using the information and
checking registries, descendants
could trace them in a manner
similar to the techniques used by
Alex Haley, author of Roots, said
Williams.

Among them is a man named
Alfred, identified as a Foulah, a
West African tribe, and owned
by an I. Lomas of Columbia, S.C.
A B.F. Taylor of Columbia is
identified as the owner of two
men, Jack from Guinea and
Renty from the Congo.
A fourth man is identified as
Jem, a Gullah, a name which de
scribes an African-English
patois still spoken by some
blacks in South Carolina, and
owned by an F.W. Green.
'Obvious reasons'
Several of the subjects were
women, but Williams said he is
not releasing their nude photos
"for obvious reasons."
Williams said he had discus
sed releasing the photographs
with black friends. The pictures
released were views from the
waist up.
