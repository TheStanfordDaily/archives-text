# Report blasts Carter

Washington (AP) — President Jimmy
Carter's energy plan would work but not
as last or as well as he has been telling the
public, according to an independent con
gressional analysis released yesterday.
And even the most controversial parts
of the plan would not make a big differ
ence in the way Americans live, the report
concluded.
The Congressional Budget Office, in
the first comprehensive look at the presi
dent's energy package now before Con
gress, generally found Carter's plan
would force Americans to use less energy
and would lower American dependence
on foreign oil.
But it said that the president's energy
advisers have been overly optimistic in
predicting how quickly their goals could
be reached.
For example, Carter's energy package
sets a goal of reducing gasoline consump
tion by 10 per cent by 1985, but the report
said that a 5 per cent cutback from the

current consumption of 7 million barrels
daily was the best his package could ac
complish.
Among other findings:
—Instead of a projected saving of 4.5
million barrels daily in oil imports, the
energy plan would bring a reduction of
3.6 million barrels.
—Industrial coal conversion, a major
element of the plan, would go more
slowly than predicted. Coal use would
rise by 360 million tons annually by 1985
instead of the 410 million tons projected
by the administration.
—The need to achieve both energy con
servation and environmental controls
may force even tougher conservation
goals than set out under the plan, espe
cially in industrial use of coal.
"The stringent application of environ
mental regulations, coupled with the de
sire to increase dramatically the use of
coal in all energy sectors, creates a
paradox," the report said. "Furthermore,
should environmental goals become even

more ambitious it is possible that ex
panded use of coal will become relatively
less desirable."
—While the energy package will con
tribute to increases in inflation about .5
per cent annually and add slightly to the
unemployment rate, there will be little
overall impact on the economy.
The congressional budget staff said it
was unrealistic to believe that the 10 per
cent cutback in gasoline consumption
could be achieved by 1985 as predicted by
Carter, considering that gasoline con
sumption rose 4.5 per cent a year from
1965 to 1975.
And it said already-existing federal
standards requiring improved gasoline
mileage on new cars will do as much or
more than the president's energy plan to
substantially cut gasoline use.
The existing mileage standards almost
make it unlikely that the standby gasoline
tax of a nickel per gallon would be
triggered before 1982, although it could
beginas early as 1978, theanaiysis found.
