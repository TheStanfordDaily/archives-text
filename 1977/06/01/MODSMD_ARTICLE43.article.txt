Stanford spiker Tom Duralde
has been selected to attend the
United States Collegiate Sports
Council's volleyball tryout camp
at Wright State University be
ginning June 18.
Duralde, a two-time All-
American and captain of the
Stanford volleyball team this
season, is one of 20 outstanding
collegiate spikers selected for
the tryouts in Dayton, Ohio.
"It is certainly going to be a
challenge," Duralde said of his
selection.
If Duralde plays well at the
camp, he will be selected to rep
resent the United States in the
World University Games in
Sophia, Bulgaria, Aug. 17-18.
"I think I have a good chance
(of making the team)," Duralde
said, "I feel pretty confident of
that."
Card volleyball coach Art
Lambert is just as confident of
Duralde's chances to play over
seas.

"Duralde is the best collegiate
volleyball player in the United
States," Lambert said.
"He has athletic sense and
good instincts. He is an intuitive
type of player. He has great leap
ing ability and good hands."
Duralde's interest in vol
leyball started when he was in
high school living in Fullerton.
In his senior year he played with
a club team from the nearby
junior college in the United
States Volleyball Association.
Duralde then played for Stanford
as a freshman. As a sophomore
he played for San Francisco's
Olympic Club, helping the team
to a seventh-place finish in the
1975 nationals.
Gives Cards a lift
Duralde returned to the Stan
ford volleyball program his
junior year and received All-
American status, boosting the
team to the Northern California
conference crown.
The biology major finished
this year with another All-

American award, while the team
finished its 11-3 season with
another conference crown and a
berth in the NCAA regionals.
Lambert said that Duralde will
be trying out as a setter for the
team. Duralde would have liked
to play setter this year, but he
was needed on the front line, ac
cording to Lambert.
"Sometimes hetries to do it all
himself, because he wants the
team to win so badly," Lambert
said.
Duralde admits that he likes
the position of setter but he is not
sure that he will be selected for
that position.
"Being a hitter would be just
as good, thought not as demand
ing (as setter)," Duralde said.
Duralde plans on playing "in
definitely" and hopes that his
tryout selection is only a start.
"This will be a good chance to
improve my skills," Duralde
said, "plus the fact that it will be
exciting to play overseas."
