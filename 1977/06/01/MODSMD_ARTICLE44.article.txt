## Cindermen in NCAA finals Lofton, Albritton seek titles 
### Bruce Anderson 
A seven-member Stanford
representation begins the NCAA
Track and Field Championships
tomorrow with hopes that by the
end ot the three-day event the
Cardinals will return to the Farm
with their best national showing
since their second-place finish
in 1963.
"This team has the potential to
score as well as any since we sent
seven people to nationals in
1963," track coach Payton Jor
dan said.
Although sending one of its
strongest overall contigents in
recent years, the scoring hopes
ot the Card cindermen ride al
most entirely on the perfor
mances of two individuals —
shot putter Terry Albritton and
long jumper James Lofton, both
considered among the favorites
in their events.
Albritton, who has never won
an NCAA outdoor title, is consi
dered an odds-on favorite to re
medy that situation when he en
ters the shot put ring Friday for
the finals.
Bob Medlin ot North Carolina
State and Alabama's Gary Eng
land look to be the 6-foot-4 Stan

ford senior's main rivals for the
shot crown. Medlin has the sec
ond longest collegiate mark this
season, 65-4V2, still five feet
short of Albritton's leading put
of 70-6V2 (67-9V4 outdoors).
To win in the long jump Lof
ton must beat 1975 titlist
Charlton Ehizuelen of Illinois
and Southern Cal freshman
Larry Doubley.
Lofton, like teammate Albrit
ton, has the world's best mark
this season in his event — 26-9.
Ehizuelen has the second best
mark, 26-7V4, and has surpassed
26 feet with clocklike consis
tency, four times in one meet.
The lllini senior, a native of
Nigeria, has the added advan
tage of jumping in his home pit.
Doubley has gained fame
hurdling his 6-foot-7 frame over
VW sand beating rivals in the
long jump bit.
Any of the three could win and
it may take a 27-foot effort to gain
the top spot on the victor's stand
after Friday's finals.
Sprinter Alan Sheats, two
and-a-half weeks off his third
place finish in the Pac-8 400-
meter dash, would seem to be the
other Card athlete with the
greatest potential to score. Yet to
score, the junior from Altadena
may have to improve on the
school record 46.08 he ran in Los
Angeles at the conference finals.
Sheats and Lofton team with
senior Marvin Holmes and
freshman Gordon Banks for the
Card entry in the 400-meter re
lay. With a best of 39.8, the sprint
foursome will have to run and
execute exchanges flawlessly to
advance to the relay final.
Hurdler Tom Shellworth runs
in the first heats of the 400-meter
intermediate tomorrow and has
his work cut out for him. Olvm

pic gold medalist and world re
cord holder Edwin Moses heads
the intermediate field.
Senior Steve Crowley lopped
nearly four seconds of his best
time to finish sixth in the Pac-8
meet and qualify for nationals
with a 3:45.6 1500-meter clock
ing. He will need to cut
at least that much off his current
best, and probably more, to move
to Saturday's finals.
"If we perform as we're capa
ble of, we should easily finish in
the first 10 to 15 teams," Jordan
said. "If we have a good day, we
could finish even higher."
While Stanford maintains its
eye on a spot in the top 10,
Pacific-8 rivals LJSC,
Washington State and UCLA
will fight with Western Athletic
Conference powers Brigham
Young, Texas-El Paso and
Arizona State for the national
crown.
Southern Cal needs come
through performances from
sprinters Clancy Edwards and

Joel Andrews, hurdlers Tom
Andrews and Mike Johnson and
discus throwers Ralph Frugug
lietti and Darrell Elder to retain
the national crown it won last
season.
Washington State is capable of
taking the whole thing if its
troupe of foreign athletes per
forms as it did at the I'ac-H meet.
Kenyan distance runners Joshua
kimeto, Samson Kimombwa and
Henry Rono, Scottish weight
man Paul Buxton and Australian
sprinter-triple jumper lan
Campbell key the Cougar title ef
fort.
UCLA must get more than the
one point it got from Olympic
silver medalist Millard 1 lampton
in the Pac-8 finals to challenge
for team honors. The Bruins
must also have top performances
out of Willie Banks in the long
and triple jumps, Creg Foster
and James Owens in the high
hurdles, and both relay teams to
give coach Jim Bush his fifth na
tional title.
