# Looking back
## A year in sports
### Chris Baker 
It was a year full of surprises.
Art Lambert coached the Cardinal water polo
team to its first NCAA crown and then resigned
just four months later to devote his coaching ef
forts to volleyball.
The men's tennis team, ranked third at the start
of the season and fourth at one point, silenced all
the doubters by winning its third NCAA crown in
five years.
Stanford has now captured 16 NCAA crowns but
this was the first time that the Cardinals have won
two NCAA titles in the same school year.
But the biggest shocker came less than 24 hours
before the 79th Big Game. Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz became the bad guy when he fired football
coach Jack Christiansen with two years remaining
on his five-year contract.
The call for Chris' scalp, fueled by the quarter
back controversy of the last three years, reached
full pitch after the gridders' 48-24 loss to USC.
Bill Walsh, selected to succeed Christiansen
after a three-week selection process doesn't face
the same pressures that Chris faced. Benjamin is
now a preseason All-American.
The return of shot putter Terry Albritton after a
three-year departure and a two-year Hawaiian
sojourn didn't make the Cards a Pac-8 track title
contender. But it did give Stanford two world
leaders. Albritton and long jumper James Lofton
own this year's top marks for their respective
events.

First-year basketball coach Dottie McCrea laid a
good foundation for the women's program and this
spring awarded the first Stanford women's basket
ball scholarship.
The field hockey team, which played before just
a handful of people just two years ago, drew SUO
people a game this season. The scotchers won the
regionals and went to the NCIAC tourney tor the
second straight year.
Debbie Meyer, the first swimmer to win three
individual Olympic gold medals, coached the
women swimmers to a second-place finish in the
nationals and helped the men's team finish
seventh in the NCAAs. But Meyer won't return
next year. She has accepted an offer to work for a
swimwear manufacturer.
There were more resignations. Golf coaches Bud
Finger and Caroll Diaz and field hockey mentor
Shirley Schoof all turned in their resignations.
The Cards appeared ready to turn the corner in
basketball, but injuries took their toll. First
coach Dick Dißiaso learned that team captain
George Schader wouldn't be able to play because
of a leg injury. And then, with the Pac-8 just about
to begin, forward Jay Carter was lost for most of the
season.
Under the guidance of first-year coach Mark
Marquess the Cardinal baseball team had an in
credible preseason playing too many Oregon Col
leges of Education and San Francisco States, then
folded in the tough Pac-8 Southern Division, end
ing the conference with a 5-13 record.
