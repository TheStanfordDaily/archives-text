# Netter with an eye on the future

### Richard Keller 
Between playing tennis three hours a day
and being an "undeclared" pre-med, Diane
Morrison doesn't spent a lot of time around
her Manzanita trailer.
Currently ranked No. 2 on the Stanford
women's tennis team, Morrison has enjoyed
a large share of success since she stroked her
first forehand at age 10. Six years later the
5-foot-5 sophomore from Los Angeles was
the National Public Parks singles and dou
bles champion. Winning ways have fol
lowed her into the college ranks; last year
she and teammate Susie Hagey were col
legiate doubles champs.
"I lost practically every match," Morrison
said of her tennis debut. "It didn't bother me
that much at the time."
It did bother her enough to put some extra
hours on the court, however.
"I had to practice a lot after school every
day," recalled Morrison. "And you figure
I've played since 10, and been in tourna
ments since 11 every weekend from the be
ginning of the year until summer. And there
would be a tournament almost every week
during the summer."
By the time she got to high school, tennis
was taking a big bite out of her life. She had
no regrets.
"I did miss some things," she elaborated,
"but I didn't regret it. I did what I wanted to,
basically. There were times when I was on
the tennis court when I wished I was at a
party. It did make me a little different."
Standout qualities
"Two things make any tennis player out
standing," commented women's coach
Anne Hill. "Physical ability — the ability to
move well on the court — and the ability to
concentrate well on what the game plan is. A
lot of players have the physical ability, but
they concentrate for short spans and then
disappear somewhere. Diane can do both."
Analyzing her own game, Morrison said,
"I like to serve and volley. I guess the volley
is my strongest shot.

"I'm weaker from the backcourt than I am
from the net," she continued. "I don't know
what particular shot is weaker. It depends on
what week you catch me on. Sometimes my
forehand will go off and other times my bac
khand will go off."
Holds own in mixed doubles
When Stanford played USC earlier this
year in a WTT-format contest, Morrison
combined with Perry Wright as the Cards'
mixed doubles duo. Morrison not only held
her own, but she also made (JSC's Chris
Lewis well aware of her presence with some
precision volleys. According to her, women
don't have to play second racket to the men.
"I try not to stand in the alley shivering,"
remarked the sophomore netter. "When I
play, I like to think I can poach. He (her
partner) should poach more if he's quicker
and better. But 1 don't think it's necessarily
true he should try to make all the shots."
Racial equity has been achieved in nearly
every major sport. In tennis, though, Arthur
Ashe has been the only black professional to
attain success. Morrison, who is black, had
no explanation for the dearth of blacks in
tennis.

Morrison said, "When I started playing
competitively, there were some black girls in
the park tournaments. But in the big tourna
ments, there were hardly any. I don't really
know why — maybe the sport is just more
popular than before."
Morrison claimed she never experienced
much discrimination as a junior. When she
played in the South, however, she noticed
that people gave her "weird looks" and re
porters wrote "weird articles" about her.
Once when she was seeded in a West Vir
ginia tourney, Morrison recalled it was "a
big shock" to the press. The papers printed a
huge photo of her and the only other black
player, with the headlines reading how they
wished there were more blacks in tennis.
The story, picture and headlines were all
taken out of context.
"I didn't even know her (the other girl's)
name," said Morrison. "They were blowing
the whole thing out of proportion. All the
reporter asked me was if I wished there were
more black tennis players and I said 'sure.' I
didn't even want to read the stupid article."
Career aspirations
Morrison is in the process of selecting a
career from a list of choices not normally
associated with a top athlete. In addition to
pro tennis, she is considering engineering,
physics and medicine.
"As long as I've gone this far I'd like to try
pro tennis, but I don't plan on being a pro
tennis player for the rest of my life. I defi
nitely plan on finishing school and going on
to graduate school."
Not quite so far in the future lie the na
tional collegiate championships, which start
Monday in Baton Rouge, La. The sophomore
standout remarked that the Cards have "a
good shot."
As far as the team goes, nothing is impos
sible, she said. "If we play well, we could
finish anywhere from one to five. It'll be hot,
humid and miserable — everything you
don't like in weather will be there. But we
should be fresh and ready to go."

ginning of the year until summer. And there
would be a tournament almost every week
during the summer."
By the time she got to high school, tennis
was taking a big bite out of her life. She had
no regrets.
"I did miss some things," she elaborated,
"but I didn't regret it. I did what I wanted to,
basically. There were times when I was on
the tennis court when I wished I was at a
party. It did make me a little different."
Standout qualities
"Two things make any tennis player out
standing," commented women's coach
Anne Hill. "Physical ability — the ability to
move well on the court — and the ability to
concentrate well on what the game plan is. A
lot of players have the physical ability, but
they concentrate for short spans and then
disappear somewhere. Diane can do both."
Analyzing her own game, Morrison said,
"I like to serve and volley. I guess the volley
is my strongest shot.

"I'm weaker from the backcourt than I am
from the net," she continued. "I don't know
what particular shot is weaker. It depends on
what week you catch me on. Sometimes my
forehand will go off and other times my bac
khand will go off."
Holds own in mixed doubles
When Stanford played USC earlier this
year in a WTT-format contest, Morrison
combined with Perry Wright as the Cards'
mixed doubles duo. Morrison not only held
her own, but she also made (JSC's Chris
Lewis well aware of her presence with some
precision volleys. According to her, women
don't have to play second racket to the men.
"I try not to stand in the alley shivering,"
remarked the sophomore netter. "When I
play, I like to think I can poach. He (her
partner) should poach more if he's quicker
and better. But 1 don't think it's necessarily
true he should try to make all the shots."
Racial equity has been achieved in nearly
every major sport. In tennis, though, Arthur
Ashe has been the only black professional to
attain success. Morrison, who is black, had
no explanation for the dearth of blacks in
tennis.

Morrison said, "When I started playing
competitively, there were some black girls in
the park tournaments. But in the big tourna
ments, there were hardly any. I don't really
know why — maybe the sport is just more
popular than before."
Morrison claimed she never experienced
much discrimination as a junior. When she
played in the South, however, she noticed
that people gave her "weird looks" and re
porters wrote "weird articles" about her.
Once when she was seeded in a West Vir
ginia tourney, Morrison recalled it was "a
big shock" to the press. The papers printed a
huge photo of her and the only other black
player, with the headlines reading how they
wished there were more blacks in tennis.
The story, picture and headlines were all
taken out of context.
"I didn't even know her (the other girl's)
name," said Morrison. "They were blowing
the whole thing out of proportion. All the
reporter asked me was if I wished there were
more black tennis players and I said 'sure.' I
didn't even want to read the stupid article."
Career aspirations
Morrison is in the process of selecting a
career from a list of choices not normally
associated with a top athlete. In addition to
pro tennis, she is considering engineering,
physics and medicine.
"As long as I've gone this far I'd like to try
pro tennis, but I don't plan on being a pro
tennis player for the rest of my life. I defi
nitely plan on finishing school and going on
to graduate school."
Not quite so far in the future lie the na
tional collegiate championships, which start
Monday in Baton Rouge, La. The sophomore
standout remarked that the Cards have "a
good shot."
As far as the team goes, nothing is impos
sible, she said. "If we play well, we could
finish anywhere from one to five. It'll be hot,
humid and miserable — everything you
don't like in weather will be there. But we
should be fresh and ready to go."


Diane Morrison
Between playing tennis three hours a day
and being an "undeclared" pre-med, Diane
Morrison doesn't spent a lot of time around
her Manzanita trailer.
Currently ranked No. 2 on the Stanford
women's tennis team, Morrison has enjoyed
a large share of success since she stroked her
first forehand at age 10. Six years later the
5-foot-5 sophomore from Los Angeles was
the National Public Parks singles and dou
bles champion. Winning ways have fol
lowed her into the college ranks; last year
she and teammate Susie Hagey were col
legiate doubles champs.
"I lost practically every match," Morrison
said of her tennis debut. "It didn't bother me
that much at the time."
It did bother her enough to put some extra
hours on the court, however.
"I had to practice a lot after school every
day," recalled Morrison. "And you figure
I've played since 10, and been in tourna
ments since 11 every weekend from the be
ginning of the year until summer. And there
would be a tournament almost every week
during the summer."

"I'm weaker from the backcourt than I am
from the net," she continued. "I don't know
what particular shot is weaker. It depends on
what week you catch me on. Sometimes my
forehand will go off and other times my bac
khand will go off."
Holds own in mixed doubles
When Stanford played USC earlier this
year in a WTT-format contest, Morrison
combined with Perry Wright as the Cards'
mixed doubles duo. Morrison not only held
her own, but she also made (JSC's Chris
Lewis well aware of her presence with some
precision volleys. According to her, women
don't have to play second racket to the men.
"I try not to stand in the alley shivering,"
remarked the sophomore netter. "When I
play, I like to think I can poach. He (her
partner) should poach more if he's quicker
and better. But 1 don't think it's necessarily
true he should try to make all the shots."
Racial equity has been achieved in nearly
every major sport. In tennis, though, Arthur
Ashe has been the only black professional to
attain success. Morrison, who is black, had
no explanation for the dearth of blacks in
tennis.

Morrison said, "When I started playing
competitively, there were some black girls in
the park tournaments. But in the big tourna
ments, there were hardly any. I don't really
know why — maybe the sport is just more
popular than before."
Morrison claimed she never experienced
much discrimination as a junior. When she
played in the South, however, she noticed
that people gave her "weird looks" and re
porters wrote "weird articles" about her.
Once when she was seeded in a West Vir
ginia tourney, Morrison recalled it was "a
big shock" to the press. The papers printed a
huge photo of her and the only other black
player, with the headlines reading how they
wished there were more blacks in tennis.
The story, picture and headlines were all
taken out of context.
"I didn't even know her (the other girl's)
name," said Morrison. "They were blowing
the whole thing out of proportion. All the
reporter asked me was if I wished there were
more black tennis players and I said 'sure.' I
didn't even want to read the stupid article."
Career aspirations
Morrison is in the process of selecting a
career from a list of choices not normally
associated with a top athlete. In addition to
pro tennis, she is considering engineering,
physics and medicine.
"As long as I've gone this far I'd like to try
pro tennis, but I don't plan on being a pro
tennis player for the rest of my life. I defi
nitely plan on finishing school and going on
to graduate school."
Not quite so far in the future lie the na
tional collegiate championships, which start
Monday in Baton Rouge, La. The sophomore
standout remarked that the Cards have "a
good shot."
As far as the team goes, nothing is impos
sible, she said. "If we play well, we could
finish anywhere from one to five. It'll be hot,
humid and miserable — everything you
don't like in weather will be there. But we
should be fresh and ready to go."
