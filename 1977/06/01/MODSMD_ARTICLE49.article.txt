Law II squeaked out an upset
win in the 'B' league softball fi
nals last weekend as the year's
IM action began to draw to a
close.
Dort, with former Varsity Club
players Bob Latta, Chuck Merja,
Tom Lyons and Tim Minor,
along with ringers Steve
Daugherty, Rich Teets and Bill
Colson, steamrollered SAE 15-9,
15-4 to win the volleybal 1 crown.
The incredible Dort seven,
which never lost a set during the
year, pulled out from a 6-6 tie in
the first game on Minor's out
standing hits to win easily.
The Flo Mo Poofders upset the
Zetes in the 'B' league volleyball
finals last night by scores of 15-6
and 16-14.
The Poofders competed all
season with only five players
while their competition had six
players. The tough Flo Mo team
comprised of people from Car
denal lost just one game en route
to the 'B' league crown. The en
tire team will return next season
and will compete in the 'A
league.
Law II used their great defense

in topping second-ranked JRA
2-1 for the 'B' softball title. Law
pulled out to a 2-0 lead, but saw
JRA come back to within one run
and load the bases with two out
in the seventh inning. With a full
count, law pitcher Dave Bertsch
got the JRA batter to fly out to
end the game.
In another exciting contest,
Organized Crime bested Faisan
4-3 for the coed softball title.
Faisan was down 4-2 in the final
inning but put the winning run
on base before succumbing.
Mike kositch and Dave Laxson
starred for the winners.
In the women's softball final,
the powerhouse FTLS nine,
made up of varsity basketball
players, crushed Les Vaches
18-4. FTLS scoied six runs in the
second and seven runs in the
third inning to put the game
away; Peg Chutich and Betsy
Lough had home runs and Ruth
Montague pitched a fine game
for the champs.
Chuck Bedford of Mirrielees
finished IM bowling competi
tion last week with a perfor
mance that may be a national IM
record. Bedford rolled a four
game series of 995, with games
of 268, 235, 259 and 233, to jump
his team into first place in the 'A'
league.
