# Board may drop ban on sororities
## 
### Mike Charison 
The Board of Trustees is expected to
lift its 33 year ban on sororities here
when it meets on campus June 10.
In addition, it is likely top adminis
trative appointments and minor build
ing projects will be approved as the
board meets for the final time until
September.
The sorority ban, dating from April
20, 1944, was "based on the conclu
sion that a dual system of sorority and
University housing was causing seri
ous disruption among women stu
dents," according to a background re
port supplied to the trustees.
The report cites Title IX of the Edu
cation Amendments of 1972 as the
force pushing the University to ban
removal. The title requires equal edu
cational opportunities and prohibits
sex discrimination.
The report acknowledges men cur
rently have a housing privilege—
subjective selectivity—if they live in a
fraternity. That privilege allows frat
members to choose with whom they

live. Since sororities are banned from
campus, such an opportunity cannot
exist for women.
Sororities not assured
The report notes recision of the ban
does not insure the return of sororities
because student interest, the ability to
finance a new residence, and other
considerations are involved.
The board will probably approve re
commendations for replacements for
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsberger and Vice
President for Development Kenneth
Creighton, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs. Both administrators have res
igned. Rosenzweig refused to reveal
the recommendations.
According to William Stone, assis
tant to the president, the search com
mittee has narrowed the field of can
didates for. the business and finance
position to a few names, and President
Richard Lyman will make the final re
commendation to the board.
Search incomplete
He said the work of the search com
mittee for the development position is
not quite complete. However,
Rosenzweig said the administration
will try to make the decision before the
meeting since the job appointment
does require board approval and the
board does not meet again for two
months.
Stone said finalists from the search
for the business and finance vice pres
idency are University administrators
now. Stone served on the search com
mittee.
The board will also be told Robert
Hamrdla, presently director of the
Academic Information Center and as
sistant dean of undergraduate studies,
will become assistant to the president
(trustee affairs) replacing retiring Fred
Glover.
Position renamed
Glover's title is Secretary of the Uni
versity, but the position will be re
named when Hamrdla assumes full
duties in August.
Stone will be leaving his post in the
president's office June 20 to become
Exec. Director of the Alumni Associa
tion. The search for a replacement will
begin soon, but the appointment does
not require board approval,
Rosenzweig said.
Another vacancy in the president's
staff will occur when Legal Adviser
James Siena leaves to take a job with
the Defense Department in July.
Stone said the search for his re
placement has not yet begun because
the legal services structure of the Uni
versity is being examined. A reorgani
zation may make appointment of a re
placement unnecessary.
Due to the large number of top ad
ministrative openings, persons pre
sently on the University staff are re-
ceiving more consideration, Stone
said.
The appointment decision is not
based solely on this, but "some operat
ing experience with the University is
going to be an advantage," Stone said.
Stone said, "We made a conscious
decision to run the search on an inter
nal basis.
"We don't want the University to
turn into an on-the-job training
school," he added.
He said with so many vacancies in
the top positions, a knowledge of Uni
versity operations should make transi
tions smoother.
The board is also expected to ap
prove a $388,000 renovation of the
bindery of the Stanford University
Press to house the Public Events Office
and the News and Publications Ser
vice.
In addition, a $318,000 project to
add approximately 2900 square feet to
the Bechtel International Center is ex
pected to receive approval.
The board should also give approval
to the concept of renovating the Loeb
Laboratory at Hopkins Marine Station
and Building 120 of the Quad, which
houses the Sociology Department.
The board will hear a report on the
recently completed Campaign for
Stanford, the $300 million drive for
gifts and pledges begun in August
1971. The report says gifts and pledges
totaled $304,248,000 or 101.4 per cent
of the target amount.
At a special meeting Friday morn
ing, the Committee on Investments
will consider "the way to conduct a
review of the policy on investment re
sponsibility including the role and
composition of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility," according
to Rosenzweig.
The board is also expected to fill
vacancies on the board, according to
Glover. He said June is the traditional
month for election of a board presi
dent. Dr. Peter Bing, present board
president, is expected to be reelected
to his second term.

dents," according to a background re
port supplied to the trustees.
The report cites Title IX of the Edu
cation Amendments of 1972 as the
force pushing the University to ban
removal. The title requires equal edu
cational opportunities and prohibits
sex discrimination.
The report acknowledges men cur
rently have a housing privilege—
subjective selectivity—if they live in a
fraternity. That privilege allows frat
members to choose with whom they

live. Since sororities are banned from
campus, such an opportunity cannot
exist for women.
Sororities not assured
The report notes recision of the ban
does not insure the return of sororities
because student interest, the ability to
finance a new residence, and other
considerations are involved.
The board will probably approve re
commendations for replacements for
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsberger and Vice
President for Development Kenneth
Creighton, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs. Both administrators have res
igned. Rosenzweig refused to reveal
the recommendations.
According to William Stone, assis
tant to the president, the search com
mittee has narrowed the field of can
didates for. the business and finance
position to a few names, and President
Richard Lyman will make the final re
commendation to the board.
Search incomplete
He said the work of the search com
mittee for the development position is
not quite complete. However,
Rosenzweig said the administration
will try to make the decision before the
meeting since the job appointment
does require board approval and the
board does not meet again for two
months.
Stone said finalists from the search
for the business and finance vice pres
idency are University administrators
now. Stone served on the search com
mittee.
The board will also be told Robert
Hamrdla, presently director of the
Academic Information Center and as
sistant dean of undergraduate studies,
will become assistant to the president
(trustee affairs) replacing retiring Fred
Glover.
Position renamed
Glover's title is Secretary of the Uni
versity, but the position will be re
named when Hamrdla assumes full
duties in August.
Stone will be leaving his post in the
president's office June 20 to become
Exec. Director of the Alumni Associa
tion. The search for a replacement will
begin soon, but the appointment does
not require board approval,
Rosenzweig said.
Another vacancy in the president's
staff will occur when Legal Adviser
James Siena leaves to take a job with
the Defense Department in July.
Stone said the search for his re
placement has not yet begun because
the legal services structure of the Uni
versity is being examined. A reorgani
zation may make appointment of a re
placement unnecessary.
Due to the large number of top ad
ministrative openings, persons pre
sently on the University staff are re-
ceiving more consideration, Stone
said.
The appointment decision is not
based solely on this, but "some operat
ing experience with the University is
going to be an advantage," Stone said.
Stone said, "We made a conscious
decision to run the search on an inter
nal basis.
"We don't want the University to
turn into an on-the-job training
school," he added.
He said with so many vacancies in
the top positions, a knowledge of Uni
versity operations should make transi
tions smoother.
The board is also expected to ap
prove a $388,000 renovation of the
bindery of the Stanford University
Press to house the Public Events Office
and the News and Publications Ser
vice.
In addition, a $318,000 project to
add approximately 2900 square feet to
the Bechtel International Center is ex
pected to receive approval.
The board should also give approval
to the concept of renovating the Loeb
Laboratory at Hopkins Marine Station
and Building 120 of the Quad, which
houses the Sociology Department.
The board will hear a report on the
recently completed Campaign for
Stanford, the $300 million drive for
gifts and pledges begun in August
1971. The report says gifts and pledges
totaled $304,248,000 or 101.4 per cent
of the target amount.
At a special meeting Friday morn
ing, the Committee on Investments
will consider "the way to conduct a
review of the policy on investment re
sponsibility including the role and
composition of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility," according
to Rosenzweig.
The board is also expected to fill
vacancies on the board, according to
Glover. He said June is the traditional
month for election of a board presi
dent. Dr. Peter Bing, present board
president, is expected to be reelected
to his second term.
The Board of Trustees is expected to
lift its 33 year ban on sororities here
when it meets on campus June 10.
In addition, it is likely top adminis
trative appointments and minor build
ing projects will be approved as the
board meets for the final time until
September.
The sorority ban, dating from April
20, 1944, was "based on the conclu
sion that a dual system of sorority and
University housing was causing seri
ous disruption among women stu
dents," according to a background re
port supplied to the trustees.

The report notes recision of the ban
does not insure the return of sororities
because student interest, the ability to
finance a new residence, and other
considerations are involved.
The board will probably approve re
commendations for replacements for
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsberger and Vice
President for Development Kenneth
Creighton, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs. Both administrators have res
igned. Rosenzweig refused to reveal
the recommendations.
According to William Stone, assis
tant to the president, the search com
mittee has narrowed the field of can
didates for. the business and finance
position to a few names, and President
Richard Lyman will make the final re
commendation to the board.
Search incomplete
He said the work of the search com
mittee for the development position is
not quite complete. However,
Rosenzweig said the administration
will try to make the decision before the
meeting since the job appointment
does require board approval and the
board does not meet again for two
months.
Stone said finalists from the search
for the business and finance vice pres
idency are University administrators
now. Stone served on the search com
mittee.
The board will also be told Robert
Hamrdla, presently director of the
Academic Information Center and as
sistant dean of undergraduate studies,
will become assistant to the president
(trustee affairs) replacing retiring Fred
Glover.
Position renamed
Glover's title is Secretary of the Uni
versity, but the position will be re
named when Hamrdla assumes full
duties in August.
Stone will be leaving his post in the
president's office June 20 to become
Exec. Director of the Alumni Associa
tion. The search for a replacement will
begin soon, but the appointment does
not require board approval,
Rosenzweig said.
Another vacancy in the president's
staff will occur when Legal Adviser
James Siena leaves to take a job with
the Defense Department in July.
Stone said the search for his re
placement has not yet begun because
the legal services structure of the Uni
versity is being examined. A reorgani
zation may make appointment of a re
placement unnecessary.
Due to the large number of top ad
ministrative openings, persons pre
sently on the University staff are re-
ceiving more consideration, Stone
said.
The appointment decision is not
based solely on this, but "some operat
ing experience with the University is
going to be an advantage," Stone said.
Stone said, "We made a conscious
decision to run the search on an inter
nal basis.
"We don't want the University to
turn into an on-the-job training
school," he added.
He said with so many vacancies in
the top positions, a knowledge of Uni
versity operations should make transi
tions smoother.
The board is also expected to ap
prove a $388,000 renovation of the
bindery of the Stanford University
Press to house the Public Events Office
and the News and Publications Ser
vice.
In addition, a $318,000 project to
add approximately 2900 square feet to
the Bechtel International Center is ex
pected to receive approval.
The board should also give approval
to the concept of renovating the Loeb
Laboratory at Hopkins Marine Station
and Building 120 of the Quad, which
houses the Sociology Department.
The board will hear a report on the
recently completed Campaign for
Stanford, the $300 million drive for
gifts and pledges begun in August
1971. The report says gifts and pledges
totaled $304,248,000 or 101.4 per cent
of the target amount.
At a special meeting Friday morn
ing, the Committee on Investments
will consider "the way to conduct a
review of the policy on investment re
sponsibility including the role and
composition of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility," according
to Rosenzweig.
The board is also expected to fill
vacancies on the board, according to
Glover. He said June is the traditional
month for election of a board presi
dent. Dr. Peter Bing, present board
president, is expected to be reelected
to his second term.
