# Personal attention awaits Slavic language students
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
How would you like some borsht to
start with and a new piroshki for an
entree? Of course you will need some
vodka to wash it all down.
Where are we — a Russian restaur
ant tucked away on some street corner
in San Francisco perhaps? No, it's a
gathering of students taking Russian
language courses here who have got
ten together for some Russian de
licacies after their final examination.
The group is small; only about 10
students of the 15 or so from the three
sections of first year Russian have de
cided to attend. Not only are activities
like this one on a more personal level,
but so is classroom instruction. There
are usually five to seven students per
instructor, a ratio which facilitates the
kind of personal instruction that stu
dents in other language classes and
other classes in general, for that mat
ter, rarely receive.
There has been nearly a 40 per cent
drop in enrollment in the Slavic Lan
guages Department's first year courses
since the University declared last year
that such courses no longer count to
ward fulfilling the humanities dis

tribution requirement.
However, enrollment in the depart
ment has always been small and in
struction will continue to be very per
sonal. In addition, second year
courses, which formerly did not fulfill
the humanities distribution require
ment, have now been upgraded and
will be applicable.
The department offers two distinct
programs at the third year level. One is

the translators program, which pre
pares students to translate technical
materials into English. The other is the
literature sequence, which acquaints
students with the history of Russian
literature, concentrating mostly on
19th and 20th century writers.
The translators program can be
combined with or taken separately
from the literature sequence.

Asst. Prof. Richard Schupbach, di
rector of the translators program, says

it offers language students a practical
skill for which there is a large demand.
The program does not attempt to offer
specialization in any specific techni
cal area, he says, but rather tries to
acquaint students with the "problems
of terminology" they might encounter.
Some students combine the program
with a major in one of the natural sci
ences. Schupbach says the program

The department offers the challenge and the
attention that serious language students long
for.

"gives the science major enough to re
ally understand what is gning on."
'Clear prose'
He says the program has been
"pretty successful" because the de
partment requires a professional level
translation at its completion. He adds,
"We demand clear expository prose."
Department Chairman Joseph Van
Campen says most students receiving
a degree from the department have lit
tle trouble getting accepted to

graduate schools. Due to a lack of jobs
for Ph.D.s, however, some students
have decided to work for the National
Security Agency, which actively re
cruits Russian majors on this campus.
One couple who were graduated
from the department went to work for
the "Voice of America," a radio station
which broadcasts western news,
music and radio programs to the
Soviet Union and Eastern European
countries.
Van Campen says it is not at all dif
ficult to visit or study in the Soviet
Union. One program that has been
very successful is a semester long
program in Leningrad at a Russian
university for students with three or
more years of college Russian. Numer
ous other programs exist which in
clude study andyor travel.
Native speakers
Although the department does not
stress oral and listening skills, Van
Campen says he feels students who
wish to obtain proficiency in these
areas can do it much more easily by
going to the Soviet Union itself after a
sound grammar preparation here. Na
tive speakers, however, do teach con-

versation and literature sections in the
second year for those wishing to gain
such skills.
Students from the department re
cently organized a Russian Club
whose membership is open to anyone
interested in any aspect of Slavic cul
ture. The club has so far organized pot
lucks and shown films produced by
Soviet filmmakers.
Next year the club will be trying to
arrange a bi-weekly lecture series on
various areas of Slavic culture, accord
ing to Cindy Becker, one of the club's
organizers. Becker says many of the

participants in the club are Russian
emigres. "That's where we get our best
cooks," she comments.
The department's faculty members
have generally received enthusiastic
evaluations in the ASSU Course
Guide. The department offers the chal
lenge and the attention that serious
language students long for.
A continued drift toward coopera
tion between the United States and the
Soviet Union may soon render a know
ledge of Russian language and civili
zation more valuable than many
people currently think.

Students from the department re
cently organized a Russian Club
whose membership is open to anyone
interested in any aspect of Slavic cul
ture. The club has so far organized pot
lucks and shown films produced by
Soviet filmmakers.
Next year the club will be trying to
arrange a bi-weekly lecture series on
various areas of Slavic culture, accord
ing to Cindy Becker, one of the club's
organizers. Becker says many of the

participants in the club are Russian
emigres. "That's where we get our best
cooks," she comments.
The department's faculty members
have generally received enthusiastic
evaluations in the ASSU Course
Guide. The department offers the chal
lenge and the attention that serious
language students long for.
A continued drift toward coopera
tion between the United States and the
Soviet Union may soon render a know
ledge of Russian language and civili
zation more valuable than many
people currently think.
How would you like some borsht to
start with and a new piroshki for an
entree? Of course you will need some
vodka to wash it all down.
Where are we — a Russian restaur
ant tucked away on some street corner
in San Francisco perhaps? No, it's a
gathering of students taking Russian
language courses here who have got
ten together for some Russian de
licacies after their final examination.
The group is small; only about 10
students of the 15 or so from the three
sections of first year Russian have de
cided to attend. Not only are activities
like this one on a more personal level,
but so is classroom instruction. There
are usually five to seven students per
instructor, a ratio which facilitates the
kind of personal instruction that stu
dents in other language classes and
other classes in general, for that mat
ter, rarely receive.
There has been nearly a 40 per cent
drop in enrollment in the Slavic Lan
guages Department's first year courses
since the University declared last year
that such courses no longer count to
ward fulfilling the humanities dis

tribution requirement.
However, enrollment in the depart
ment has always been small and in
struction will continue to be very per
sonal. In addition, second year
courses, which formerly did not fulfill
the humanities distribution require
ment, have now been upgraded and
will be applicable.
The department offers two distinct
programs at the third year level. One is

the translators program, which pre
pares students to translate technical
materials into English. The other is the
literature sequence, which acquaints
students with the history of Russian
literature, concentrating mostly on
19th and 20th century writers.
The translators program can be
combined with or taken separately
from the literature sequence.

Asst. Prof. Richard Schupbach, di
rector of the translators program, says

it offers language students a practical
skill for which there is a large demand.
The program does not attempt to offer
specialization in any specific techni
cal area, he says, but rather tries to
acquaint students with the "problems
of terminology" they might encounter.
Some students combine the program
with a major in one of the natural sci
ences. Schupbach says the program

The department offers the challenge and the
attention that serious language students long
for.

"gives the science major enough to re
ally understand what is gning on."
'Clear prose'
He says the program has been
"pretty successful" because the de
partment requires a professional level
translation at its completion. He adds,
"We demand clear expository prose."
Department Chairman Joseph Van
Campen says most students receiving
a degree from the department have lit
tle trouble getting accepted to

graduate schools. Due to a lack of jobs
for Ph.D.s, however, some students
have decided to work for the National
Security Agency, which actively re
cruits Russian majors on this campus.
One couple who were graduated
from the department went to work for
the "Voice of America," a radio station
which broadcasts western news,
music and radio programs to the
Soviet Union and Eastern European
countries.
Van Campen says it is not at all dif
ficult to visit or study in the Soviet
Union. One program that has been
very successful is a semester long
program in Leningrad at a Russian
university for students with three or
more years of college Russian. Numer
ous other programs exist which in
clude study andyor travel.
Native speakers
Although the department does not
stress oral and listening skills, Van
Campen says he feels students who
wish to obtain proficiency in these
areas can do it much more easily by
going to the Soviet Union itself after a
sound grammar preparation here. Na
tive speakers, however, do teach con-

versation and literature sections in the
second year for those wishing to gain
such skills.
