# Former 'New Republic' head
## Bruce Bliven dies 
### 
Bruce Bliven, former editor of the
New Republic, and for years a resident
of Stanford, died last Friday at the
Stanford Hospital. Bliven was 88.
A member of the Class of 1911, Bli
ven began his career as a writer during
college, serving as a correspondent for
the now defunct San Francisco Bulle
tin. After graduating, Bliven served as
director of the journalism department
at USC.
Later he was a member of the New
York Globe, and from there he went on
to become editor of the New Republic,
a position he held from 1923 until
1955.
Bliven and his wife Rose, long resi
dents of Kingscote Gardens, became
famous all over the country for their
Christmas letters, in which they gave
humorous and insightful glances into
their lives and experiences.
In his autobiography, Five Million
Words Later, Bliven gave his impres
sions of the changing world he had
observed, beginning with his boyhood
in lowa, where he watched some of the
last covered wagons begin the long
trip to the coast.
Bliven was hospitalized some weeks
ago after an accident which left him
with several broken bones.
Often seen about campus, Bliven
took long walks at the urging of his
physician. He was a frequent visitor to
the Daily office. Bliven gave a speech
in connection with the dedication of
the Storke Student Publications Build
ing, and had been active in campus
journalism while a student here.
After retiring from the New Repub
lic, Bliven came to Stanford, where he
served as a lecturer in the Communica
tion Department until a few years ago.
Bliven wrote extensively in several

fields. Aside from editorial and jour
nalistic writing at the New Republic,
he also published several books on sci
ence and the history of technology.
Among these are The WorldiChangers
and The Unfinished Business of Sci
ence.
During his days at the New Repub
lic, Bliven worked with such literature
and political figures as George Bernard
Shaw, Virginia Woolf and John
Maynard Keynes. One investigation he
headed after World War I resulted in a
Congressional investigation of a milit
ary prison outside Paris.
Bliven distinguished himself at the
New Republic as an outspoken liberal
during a not-so-liberal age. In one sec
tion of Five Million Words Later, he
discussed the problems of being an
outspoken liberal.
"Most Americans are incapable of
distinguishing among liberals,
socialists and communists," Bliven
writes. "It is not surprising, therefore,
that from the beginning the New Re
public was damned by the far right as
being an organ of extreme radicalism."
Through his years, through his ex
periences and through his writings,
Bliven gave his friends and readers his
own view of the world and mankind.
But through it all, he never lost sight of
himself or his humanity.
In the closing pages of Five Million
Words Later, Bliven reaffirms his
ideas about human nature.
In closing, he states: "Almost all of
mankind's problems that loom so large
today are of our own creation, yet the
bulk of humanity is essentially good.
Our culture, in the most advanced na
tions, is beginning to catch up with our
dilemmas....the future is bright."
