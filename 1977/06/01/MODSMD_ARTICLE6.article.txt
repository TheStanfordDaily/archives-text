# Santa Clara water bond winning late last night
## 
### 
San Jose (AP) — A $56 million water
project bond issue was winning nar
rowly yesterday in voting by residents
of fast-growing Santa Clara County.
With about a third of the ballots
counted late yesterday, the vote was
17,784 yes and 15,482 no.
The measure was aimed at avoiding
a future drought crisis and stopping
the ground from sinking below sea
level.
If approved, the revenue bond issue
would be added to $12.9 million in
available cash to build distribution
pipelines, treatment plants and pond
facilities for recharging the ground
water supply that has been dwindling
in the second year of the worst drought
in California history.
The water would be delivered to
Santa Clara County through a 20-mile
system of 11-foot high mountain tun
nels, canals and pipelines known as
the San Felipe project.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
plans to spend over $200 million on
the project. It would be repaid by sel
ling water, transported from mountain

reservoirs 250 miles to the north, to
Santa Clara County and neighboring
San Benito County.
The drought has reawakened fears
that this metropolis 50 miles south of
San Francisco could start sinking
slowly below the salt water level of
adjacent San Francisco Bay.
That is because about half of the
water supply comes from giant under
ground pools of water which are reced
ing to the point where sinking could
start again next year.
The ground sinking — subsidence to
geologists — has been arrested since
1969, a few years after the county
began buying imported water from the
state to recharge the underground
water supply.
But the combination of the drought
and growth — the county's 1.2 million
population is projected to grow to 1.6
million by the year 2000 — has raised
the problem of sinking again.
The new water source would not
only provide for new growth, but
would allow the underground reser
voirs to be recharged, proponents said.
