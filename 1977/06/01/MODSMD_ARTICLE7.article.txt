# Mitchell nabs singles crown at NCAA finals
## Matt Mitchell 
### Jill Lieber 
Matt Mitchell really did it this time. He copped the
most coveted crown in collegiate tennis—the NCAA
singles title.
Monday, the sophomore Ail-American defeated 12th
seeded Tony Graham of UCLA, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. Top
seeded Mitchell moved into the finals with a win over
unseeded Chris Lewis of USC, 6-2, 6-4.
Mitchell's momentary lapse in the second set of the
finals almost cost him the title. Down 1-3 in the third set,
Mitchell said the turning point in the match came when
he broke Graham's service when the third set was tied
three-all.
"It boiled down to getting the ball over the net," said
Mitchell, who excused his second set performance as
just "getting off to a bad start." He added he felt "very
weak" in that set.
When asked to describe the over-all match, Mitchell
said, "All I did was go out and hit a few balls."
Those few balls won Mitchell the third NCAA singles
title for Stanford in the last five years. Sandy Mayer won
in 1973 and John Whitlinger triumphed in 1974 for the
Cards.
"Seriously," he said, "it's just a match. There was
more pressure to it than other matches I've played."
Is it Mitchell's biggest win?
"Over Tony Graham? No," he replied. "The tourna
ment itself. Yes."
Was he disappointed he didn't meet tough Trojan
Bruce Manson, the No. 38 ranked male in the country?

"It's totally irrelevant who you play," he said. "I'm not
disappointed. Well, it might have been good to play
Bruce. Actually, it would have been fun. He and I were
both looking for the title."
Mitchell also combined forces with junior Perry
Wright in doubles competition, but the two were ousted
in the quarterfinals by UCLA's John Austin and Bruce
Nichols, 7-6, 6-3.
Also involved in the singles portion of the tourney
were No. 4 seed Bill Maze, No. 14 seed Perry Wright and
Maze and sophomore John Rast in doubles.
Maze outlasted Mark Turpin of Southern Methodist
University in his opener, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, but lost to Erick
Iskersky of Trinity in the second round, 6-4,6-4. Iskersky
is a freshman.
Wright was a first-round loser to Bill Clarke of Kansas,
6-1,6-3.
Maze and Rast were defeated in round two. They lost
to Trinity's Larry Gottfried and Tony Giammalva, 4-6,
6-4, 7-5.
The doubles title went to USC's Manson and Chris
Lewis, who downed UCLA's team of Austin and Nichols,
who played in the No. 3 spot for the Bruins this season,
6-2, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.
Mitchell captured two other tournament singles titles
this year, winning the National Amateur Indoors singles
and doubles titles and the Ojai Intercollegiates. This
summer, he said, he plans to play for the U.S. Junior
Davis Cup team and enter Association of Tennis Profes
sionals (ATP) tournaments.
