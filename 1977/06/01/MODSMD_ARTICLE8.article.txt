# Stanford Daily
## Opinions Viewpoint 'Daily' insights 
### 
The final viewpoint of the volume trad
itionally is reserved for a listing of the
editor's accomplishments and failures
during his or her term. However, I think it
would be more rewarding for the readers
and the Daily staff to use this space for
some insight into the Daily machine.
A Daily staffer does not need an alarm
clock. The snickers outside her door are
enough. "My God, it's 11 and she hasn't
even gotten up yet. Her Chronicle's still
outside her door." Outsiders tend to
forget the Daily works on essentially a
noon to 3 a.m. schedule, Sunday through
Thursday. If you call before noon or on
Friday or Saturday, you are likely to be
answered by the irritated grunts that
come from a person who thought he or
she had found a quiet place to study.

The Daily office begins to hum in the
afternoon. The phone rings. A tip — pro
testers are organizing a march to Presi
dent Lyman's office. The news editor
calls eight reporters. His beat reporter,
familiar with the protesters' demands,
has a paper due the next day. Five repor
ters are not home. One reporter would
like to do the story but is working on a
review for the entertainment depart
ment. The eighth reporter agrees to cover
the march, but he has written only two
stories for the Daily.

A woman carrying pamphlets rushes
into the office and demands, "We want
publicity. We need a story in the Daily."
Never ask for publicity. Journalists recoil
at the thought of being used. Say you
have some information that may make a
good story. Then explain why it would
appeal to Stanford readers. Offering a
press release to an editor increases your
chances of getting a story, but there is
always a chance the editor cannot find a
reporter.

The phone rings. "I want a correction
in tomorrow's paper." "Why?" "I was
misquoted." "But the reporter has what
you said in his notes." "But I didn't mean
to say exactly that. He took it out of con
text."

It is nearing 5 p.m. A reporter waits for
his phone calls to be returned. He only
has one side of a story but all the people

who have the ether side either refuse to
talk or are unavailable. Finally he reaches
someone. "Hi, this is John Jones from the
Stanford Daily. I'd like to talk to you
about the incident which occurred to
day." The person says some great quotes
and then slides in a "you're not going to
print that, are you?" or "by the way, that's
off the record." Then the editor has to
step in to explain everything is on the
record when speaking to a reporter who
has identified himself. If you don't want
something printed, don't say it or tell the
reporter it's off the record before you say
it.

At night all the stories have been
typeset except for a few for the front page.
The operation shifts to the ASSU
Typesetting Shop where the paper.is
pasted up. Once Around the Quad runs
two inches long. You know someone will
be angry but you have to cut. You are
saving space on the sports page for some
late schedule results. The person with the
score never calls. A story on the front
page is long. At 2 a.m. you re-lay out the
page juggling a few pictures and head
lines to save a few inches of the story.

Every campus official has his or her
horror story to tell about the Daily — the
misquotes, the story that never ran, the
lines cut out of an opinions piece. We
even have our own. What about the time
we invented the day November 31 or
switched identifications on the pictures
of Halsey Royden and Lee Yearley?
What about the time we ran David Sar
toris' column twice?
I think it is important for our readers to
know that Daily staffers are people too —
and even worse, they are students. How
ever, despite the problems, it is fun work
ing for the Daily. We are able to interview
Garry Trudeau, Walter Cronkite, and
Ronald Reagan. We have the chance to be
lovingly "mauled" by Koko the Gorilla.
We probably enjoyed the 294 arrests
more than the protesters (except for the
late hours, the Daily went to press at 5:20
a.m.). All in all, I'm happy with my deci
sion to come back to the Daily after my
first story was butchered.
