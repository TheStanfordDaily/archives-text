# Comments on 'mythical monster' Nixon
##

Robert G. Cohn

From comments following the
last Frost interview, it has be
come evident that the mythical
monster Nixon will some day be
replaced by a plausible — tacky,
fallible, historically unlucky,
fundamentally patriotic, gritty,
political, insightful and finally
tragic — human being.
It is not true to say that Nixon
claimed, in the interviews, to be
above the law. What he said was
that in crucial circumstances
(such as the war emergency
coupled with a grave threat of
internal disorder) and within

limits (such as murder — al
though his predecessors has not
always stopped there, as we
know) he could go beyond strict
legality. It is a plain matter of
historical record that many of
our greatest American presi
dents, including Lincoln and
Roosevelt, had done just that.
The historical mitigating cir
cumstances in the case of Nixon
were many and remarkable.
Among those which future his
torians will have to take into ac
count was the deep sociological
change to which Zbigniew Bre

zinski alludes in his article in
Fortune magazine: the (to me not
very promising, publicly) chal
lenge to WASP power posed by
rising "outsider" races and clas
ses, in alliance with the liberal
dominated media and self
destructive elements in the
WASP sector (corresponding to
the French intellectual aristoc
racy before the revolution).
It has yet to be demonstrated
that these new elements have
anything better to offer than the
America of the pre-Vietnam era:
on the contrary, most signs poi nt

to near-disaster if not worse,
morally and in most other ways.
This crisis was aggravated by
the demographic fact, in the
'60s, of an unprecedented
number of young people. Some
were spoiled from an affluent
period and spoiling for trouble;
some from humbler cir
cumstances were restlessly "on
the make": all were egged on by
"outsider" adults in a revan
chiste mood. Whence, given the
trying war situation, they readily
became mutinous, especially on
the campuses where there is gre
ater leeway for breakaway man
ifestations.
Though inexperienced, intel
lectually "glum and incurious"
(Podhoretz), numbed by rock
music, drugs, sex, bullhorn
fanaticism, yet they were shrewd
and youthfully energetic enough
to be as dangerous as the book
burning students of Bologna or
Rome are today.
The fact that both groups, Ita
lian and American, had grie
vances which are easily seen as
legitimate did not lessen the
problem presented to govern
ment.
Back then there was the be
ginning of the developing gen
eral crisis of the West, the deca
dence and inflation on all levels
which has led to the appaling
amount of juvenile crimes and
the confession to pollsters of a
near-majority of parents that
they no longer believe in family,
country, religion. All this even
then made the threat to author
ity, in the midst of war, particu
larly sticky in a land which is so
vulnerable, in the short term, to
attack from within because of its
"democratic" openness (which
is wonderful theoretically and in
our usual practice but can be car
ried to mad, runaway extremes,
oblivious of any reasonable, liv
able concept of balance or
health).
Oh to get on TV and prove you
exist, in an era whence the spirit
had departed and one was hard

put to find what was "simple
and true" (Saul Bellow, in his
Nobel address).
So they flocked around the
White House, identifying with
the charismatic youth-leaders
who seemed so real as they
locked arms and intoxicated
themselves with chants and slo
gans, sometimes seeking a
cheapshot martyrdom in cop
baiting. It is no fun to dwell on
these disappointing matters but
they help to explain the despera
tion and miserable outcome of
Watergate .
Oh, Nixon was sneaky and
messy and sanctimonious him
self, all right. As has been said,
he was human, human and
ciuchety as one of Bellow's own
characters, say from Chicago.
But who now among the self
righteous, unchallenged young,
or their strangely paralyzed
teachers .understands the
realities of an earlier, sprawling
and vital America? Who even
recognizes genuine suffering
when he sees it? Or the pos
sibilities of redemption? Or that
he, and other politicians he sup
ports (such as the vindictive
Church) may do as badly or
worse?
Sex is a matter of rational
moves and indifferent equality
instead of being, also, at times,
the problematic and even tragic
business of basic difference and
rejection, followed by the mira
cle which is the essence of life:
reconciliation, forgiveness, and
deep love. This modern failure
of heart leads inevitably to alie
nation and a season in hell,
Cocytus. the region of icy isola
tion, cut off from"the true life"
(Proust) including communion
with the past, with our all-too
human fathers whom we easily
dismissed in our juvenile smug
ness but who have a way of re
turning awesomely magnified to
haunt us as in Kafka.
