Investigate the Book Community!
In the immediate vicinity of Stanford is a solid book community that makes
available to all residents of the area books of all kinds and from all over the world.
Kepler's Books specializes in paperbacks.
We have what is probably the most complete paperback bookstore in the country.
Visit us and see.
Additionally you'll find selected hardcovers, foreign and domestic periodicals,
and full color photo and art posters.
Browsing is an indoor sport at Kepler's. Come for an afternoon or evening.
