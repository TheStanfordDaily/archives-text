Maybe we'll
cure cancer
without your
help,
but don't bet
your life on it.
The way it stands today,
one American out of four
will someday have cancer.
That means it will strike
some member in two out
of three American families.
To change those statistics
we have to bring the
promise of research to
everyday reality. And to
expand our detection
program and techniques.
And that takes money. Lots
of money. Money we won't
have—unless you help us.
The American Cancer
Society will never give up
the fight. Maybe we'll
find the answers even
without your help.
But don't bet your
life on it.
