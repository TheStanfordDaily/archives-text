WELCOME TO SILICON VALLEY—birthplace of calculator technology and home
of Mr. Calculator. We serve the scientific community with the finest quality electronic
technology available. Our success is associated with our ability to match the cal

From its jewel-like sculptured metal keys to its whisper-thin styling and
brushed aluminum finish-the 5K is simply a breed apart.
Beneath its elegant exterior beats a technology so new that bat
tery life is a remarkable 5000 hours! No other calculator battery lasts
this long. If the 5K were used one hour a day, every day of the year, bat
tery replacement would not occur until almost 14 years from now.
That's 1991. Convenience aside, this represents a major saving in
battery expense.

WELCOME TO SILICON VALLEY—birthplace of calculator technology and home
of Mr. Calculator. We serve the scientific community with the finest quality electronic
technology available. Our success is associated with our ability to match the cal

which recognizes the optimum conservation of resources and we have found that
our customers recognize this principle. Please stop by and let us show you ways to
conserve your resources.
ULTRA SLIM LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY
From its jewel-like sculptured metal keys to its whisper-thin styling and
brushed aluminum finish-the 5K is simply a breed apart.
Beneath its elegant exterior beats a technology so new that bat
tery life is a remarkable 5000 hours! No other calculator battery lasts
this long. If the 5K were used one hour a day, every day of the year, bat
tery replacement would not occur until almost 14 years from now.
That's 1991. Convenience aside, this represents a major saving in
battery expense.
Brilliance in design and engineering complement the sK's perform

square root and unusually large Liquid Crystal
Display characters for excellent clarity. It is
