Three Part Harmony
The Diamond Trio
Gleim Jewelers has specialized in fine engagement rings
for nearly 50 years. This very special diamond trio
is one of Gleim's exclusive creations. It features a lovely
diamond with hand-crafted band, plus two ring guards.
Wear them three different ways —the ring guards, the
ring, or all three together. A most engaging idea from
Gleim's. For those moments to remember,
remember Gleim Jewelers.
