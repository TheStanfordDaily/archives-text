# PALO ALTO
## Palo Alto a city of many faces 
### Chris Baker 
Even Leland Stanford
wouldn't recognize the horse
farm today.

• When the first students came
' Stanford in 1891 the sur
rounding country was strictly
agricultural. Today Santa Clara
County is one of the leading elec
tronics research centers in the
world.
When Stanford opened its
doors, the population of Palo
Alto, Menlo Park and the sur
rounding area numbered around
1000. Today over 50,000 people
call Palo Alto home.
The Mid-Peninsula area un
derwent a transformation after
World War II when the popula
tion tripled. But Palo Alto hasn't
|£ad many of the problems which
P»ve plagued Los Angeles North
San Jose.
Planning
The city has been a leader in
urban planning. After a court
battle between the developers
and residentialists in the early
19605, the bay lands and foothills
escaped the bulldozer and will
remain essentially undeveloped.
Palo Alto has also been a
leader in social services, becom
ing one of the first cities to come
to grips with its drug problem.
The Palo Alto drug prevention
program has served as a model
ior other cities. Palo Alto's prog
ram for the elderly has also
been copied by other cities and
with the cost of housing soaring,
the city also attempted to set up
government funded housing.

But if Palo Alto is one of the
most progressive cities it can
also be one of the most conserva
tive.
No pinball
The City Council has banned
pinball arcades because of the
possibility that Palo Alto's youth
might come under bad influ
ences. Last December the City
shut down its massage parlors in
a pre-dawn police raid.
Other cities are watching
the massage parlor legal battles
closely and if the city is success
ful in keeping the parlors closed
more cities may follow its lead.
But despite its sometimes
puritanical outbursts, Palo Alto
is in the avant garde of mid-size
municipalities. The city was at
tempting to solve its transporta
tion problems long before the na
tion realized that the automobile
might not be the American
dream.
If you ever get stuck at the stop
light at the intersection of El
Camino and Page Mill Road,
you'll probably start thinking
about the advantages of walking
or buying a bicycles.
Electronics
What started out in David Pac
kard's garage has spawned one
of the largest electronics com
plexes in the world. Hewlett-
Packard is now one of the largest
electronics firms in the nation
and it has been one of the reasons
why many other research firms
have settled on the Mid-
Peninsula.
During the late 1960s and

early '7os these firms, along with
the Stanford Research Institute,
were a target for Vietnam war
protesters because of their in
volvement in the war effort.
Stanford boasts one of the largest
government sponsored research
projects in the nation. The Stan
ford Linear Accelerator is the
largest facility of its kind any
where and draws researchers
from all over the world.
Publishing is another large
industry on the Mid-Peninsula.
Among others, Sunset Publish
ing Company has located its
world headquarters in Menlo
Park.
The Sunset building is almost
as pretty as Sunset Magazine.
Tours are available every day
and it's a popular tourist attrac
tion. The West Coast headquar
ters of the Wall Street Journal is
also located in Palo Alto, which
is the reason why there is no
delay between publication and
distribution.
Research
But research is still the name
of the game on the Mid-
Peninsula. Ames Research Lab,
located in Mountain View, has
played a major role in the space
program.
Ames is located next to those
big silos which look like blimp
hangers at Moffet Naval Air Sta

tion. Moffet Field, located next
to the Bay just off Highway 101,
is one of the largest military air
fields in the nation.
Another large industry which
employs many people in this
area is medicine. The Stanford
Medical Center is a leader in
cardiovascular, sleep, cancer
and sex-change research.
The Palo Alto Veterans Hospi
tal is foremost among Veterans
Hospitals. And it is not a bad
place to do literary research
either. Ken Kesey based his
book One Flew Over the Cuc
koos Nest in part on material he
gathered at the Palo Alto Vete
rans Hospital.
Charm
But the area, because of good
planning, still retains the charm
which caused Leland Stanford to
settle here in the first place.
Woodside, Los Altos and Por
tola Valley maintain a rustic ap
proach to residentialization.
And if you want to admire scen
ery, Palo Alto includes within its
borders plenty of wide-open,
old-fashioned rural space fil
led with nothing but trees, grass
and chaparral.
In fact, as dramatic a
metamorphis as developed Palo
Alto has undergone, these parts
of the city have changed so little
that Leland and Jane Stanford
would still feel right at home.

Stanford Shopping Center, just down the road from
the Medical Center, includes several large department
stores and numerous specialty shops.

One of Palo Alto's three main shopping areas, Town
and Country Village, is located on the other side of El
Camino Real from the Stadium.

University Avenue is the main street of Palo Alto and was the original shopping
district.
