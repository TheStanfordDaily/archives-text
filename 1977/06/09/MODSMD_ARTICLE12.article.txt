# An Epicurean approach to the Mid peninsula
## 'Hole in the wall' Mexican eateries abound 
### Harry Killas 
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include huevos rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with penty of chips. Two combi
nation plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and
rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
But hamburger was used in
these dishes instead of the more
authentic shredded beef. Not
only was the meat small in por
tion, but it was dry and flavorless

as well. On the other hand, the
standard accompaniments re
fried beans and rice (mixed, in
this case, with corn) were both
excellent.
Although the service was
quick and friendly, the food,
even with added hot sauce,
needed more character.
Tucked away in cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Ranceros at $2 is the most popu

lar. The fried chicken is only $3
and Mexican butterfried steak
comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and dessert
for only $4. Menu do (beef tripe
soup) and Paella Valenchana
($1.75 the only non-Mexican
item) are weekend specialties.
All combination plates are
excellent ($2.60-$2.80) and in
clude a crisp house salad, a de
lectable consome de polio (chic
ken broth, garnished with
freshly diced onion, tomato and
green chile peppers) and
noteworthy rice and refritos.
Don't pass up the burrito with
chicken chunks in green tomato
sauce or the chile rellenos that
contain real jalapenos. Pob
lanito's tostada is a standout

it's succulent chicken pieces on
a bed of lettuc adorned with a
liberal amount of guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular
storefront restaurant in Moun
tain View with the most exten
sive Latin menu of the three re
staurants. The Mexcican dishes
are excellent, but here the
specialties are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations.
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
papusa. Although the en
chiladas and the refritos are not
inspired, thepapusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or a
combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).

The Salvadorean dishes
range from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Polla Encebollado
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade beef
soup ($1.95) with fresh zucchini,
tomato, cabbage and corn on the
cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks
quanabana and amarindo
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher thaiy
those at the other restaurants
but the portions are larger. El-
Calderonis a fun place to go and,
consequently, reservations on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
are a must.
