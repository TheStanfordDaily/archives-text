Needless to say, "good eating" is a nebulous
phrase. First of all, it requires a definition of the
words "good food," and food is a commodity about
which no two humans feel the same.
What is more, "good eating" refers not only to
edibles but also to service, atmosphere and style,
and the infinite permutations thereof. Does it follow,
then, that the only way to find a good restaurant in
the Stanford area is by trial and error? Must those
who desire something beyond Jack-in-the-Box and
Mac Donald's approach the plethora of local eateries
with no counsel other than their own gastric juices?
Fortunately, the answer is no. There are a few
people, blessed with both wide and reliable taste in
restaurants, who can make the search for "good eat
ing" considerably simpler, and Harry Killas, we
think, is one of them. Harry is the Daily's resident
restaurant reviewer, and unless you are possessed of
unusually large amounts of both time and money,
his advice is worth heeding.
