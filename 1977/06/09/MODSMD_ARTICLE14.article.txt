# Vietnamese food in Mountain View
## 
### Harry Killas 
Thirteen years ago, Nguyen
ton Hoan was vice-premier of the
Republic of Vietnam. Included
in his administrative sphere
were the ministries of interior,
education and defense.
But the war displaced many
people and today, he runs the
Mekong Restaurant in
downtown Mountain View.
Hoan's present position belies
his past. One would hardly sus
pect, as he seats you and exp
lains the Vietnamese cuisine,
that he once controlled critical
segments of Vietnam's govern
ment.
Hoan does not talk much
about his days in power. He left
the government in 1965 and
came to the United States in
1966 where he taught his native
language to American service
men.
Hoan has run the Mekong for
almost six years now.
Hoan says he was interested in

introducing Vietnamese dishes
to Americans. "We are very
proud of our culture and the way
we eat," he says. He seems
genuinely concerned that you
enjoy all the dishes from his
country.
Because of Vietnam's geog
raphical location, its cuisine
combines the spices and culi
nary techniques of China and
India. Another influence on Vie
tnamese cooking was the French
occupation of Indochina.
The authentic menu lists five
soups (around $1). Most of the 23
entrees are in the $3 range and
include Vietnamese cuisines,
sweet and sour dishes, barbeque
and French-influenced dishes
such as chicken maison and the
Vietnamese omelet. Side dishes
and various desserts (all in the $1
range) are also listed.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.

The great care in the preparation
of food at the Mekong is reflected
in the distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients. Each
dish has a different marinade
and all dishes are prepared to
order.
An jexcellent appetizer is the
imperial roll ($ .90). It is similar
to the Chinese spring roll, but it
is larger, richer in taste and is
wrapped in rice paper. It arrives
steaming and, like most entrees
at the Mekong, is garnished
with parsley and pickled carrots.
Of the soups, the abalone and
rice is superb.
A large bowl of a delicate,
flavorful chicken broth contain
ing white pieces of abalone, rice
and small meat balls, topped
with scallion and pepper, is one
of the Mekong's best dishes.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.

The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green oAion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is
beef brochette ($3.95), two bam-jj
boo skewers of tender marinated
beef interspersed with crunchy
pieces of celery and green pep
per.
Dessert at the Mekong is worth
the calories. Both fritters
banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple beignets ($l.lO are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.
Before Hoan began running
the Mekong, the building
housed a cafe with a
motif. The Vietnamese decoJ|[
and ferns have provided a con-"
vincing transformation. Classi
cal guitar and chamber music
contribute to the casual,
civilized atmosphere. Service is
unobtrusive.

Republic of Vietnam. Included
in his administrative sphere
were the ministries of interior,
education and defense.
But the war displaced many
people and today, he runs the
Mekong Restaurant in
downtown Mountain View.
Hoan's present position belies
his past. One would hardly sus
pect, as he seats you and exp
lains the Vietnamese cuisine,
that he once controlled critical
segments of Vietnam's govern
ment.
Hoan does not talk much
about his days in power. He left
the government in 1965 and
came to the United States in
1966 where he taught his native
language to American service
men.
Hoan has run the Mekong for
almost six years now.
Hoan says he was interested in

introducing Vietnamese dishes
to Americans. "We are very
proud of our culture and the way
we eat," he says. He seems
genuinely concerned that you
enjoy all the dishes from his
country.
Because of Vietnam's geog
raphical location, its cuisine
combines the spices and culi
nary techniques of China and
India. Another influence on Vie
tnamese cooking was the French
occupation of Indochina.
The authentic menu lists five
soups (around $1). Most of the 23
entrees are in the $3 range and
include Vietnamese cuisines,
sweet and sour dishes, barbeque
and French-influenced dishes
such as chicken maison and the
Vietnamese omelet. Side dishes
and various desserts (all in the $1
range) are also listed.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.

The great care in the preparation
of food at the Mekong is reflected
in the distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients. Each
dish has a different marinade
and all dishes are prepared to
order.
An jexcellent appetizer is the
imperial roll ($ .90). It is similar
to the Chinese spring roll, but it
is larger, richer in taste and is
wrapped in rice paper. It arrives
steaming and, like most entrees
at the Mekong, is garnished
with parsley and pickled carrots.
Of the soups, the abalone and
rice is superb.
A large bowl of a delicate,
flavorful chicken broth contain
ing white pieces of abalone, rice
and small meat balls, topped
with scallion and pepper, is one
of the Mekong's best dishes.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.

The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green oAion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is
beef brochette ($3.95), two bam-jj
boo skewers of tender marinated
beef interspersed with crunchy
pieces of celery and green pep
per.
Dessert at the Mekong is worth
the calories. Both fritters
banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple beignets ($l.lO are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.
Before Hoan began running
the Mekong, the building
housed a cafe with a
motif. The Vietnamese decoJ|[
and ferns have provided a con-"
vincing transformation. Classi
cal guitar and chamber music
contribute to the casual,
civilized atmosphere. Service is
unobtrusive.
