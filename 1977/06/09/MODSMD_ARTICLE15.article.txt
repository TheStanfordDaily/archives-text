# Best fish not necessarily in S.F.

### 
San Francisco, renowned
mecca of seafood restaurants,
has a daily supply of the freshest
fish. Dungenness crab and sal-
when in season, are ex
jßfcremely choice. A Bay Area spe-
is abalone and when it's
properly prepared and that's
rare it is superb.
But instead of the long journey
to San Francisco or even Mon
terey for a seafood meal, three
restaurants close to campus offer
fresh fish. In general, their
menus state which dishes are
frozen seafood products (a good
rule of thumb, for example, is
that prawns are always frozen),
and which are not.
Don't be surprised if what you
want isn't available that day; av
y ailability of all seafood is subject
Aito season, weather and just plain
▼fishing luck. On the other hand,
fish recommended that day for
their freshness are usually good
bets.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
Dinners include forgettable

Romano potatoes or rice, a small
scoop of coleslaw or huge ripe
cherry tomatoes. Oddly enough,
no soup or salad is included.
A great beginning is the
savoury Manhattan-style clam
chowder (with tomatoes) at $.55
a cup, $.95 a bowl. It may not be
the "world's best, "but it is so hot
you have to wait for it to cool
down. Seafood cocktails (crab
$2.25, shrimp $1.95, combina
tion $2.15) arrive in a small bowl
with seafood sauce and lemon
wedges. Crab and shrimp louies
are available in half order
($3.25-$3.60).
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor. Fresh that day, Troll
Chinook Salmon ($6.75) was
perfectly cooked, succulent and
outstanding.
Each item of the combination
($4.95) white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good bets
are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly because
of its antiqued decor complete
with bentwood chairs and old

fishing photos, and its youthful,
cheery staff (which is extremely
efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Lobster from Maine crawl
around in a tank in the kitchen.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scal
lops Saute Belle Meuniere
($6.50), especially if you are for
tunate enough to have scallops
fresh that day. Carefully pre
pared, the scallops are saved
from the toughness of overcook
ing.
Non-seafood fans will be
pleased with the large selection
of beef dishes and Jade Chicken
($6.95), served with grapes.
Nice touches at The Square
Rigger include a salad crowned
with shrimp, a relish tray that
includes eggroll and fresh veg
etables and sesame bread instead
of the übiquitous sourdough.
Flatware and the house coffee
are a Hut above the ordinary.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portions aren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition to most
San Francisco seafood estab
lishments and has the most var
ied menu with the largest por

tions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere(sB.2s), Paella ($7.25)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness. Non-seafood items in
clude prime rib ($8.25), broiled
half chicken ($6.50) and Veal
Saltimbocca ($8.25), which was
written up in Sunset Magazine.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat sauce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese
($7.95) is highly recommended.
It has a fragrant garlic aroma and
a piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Six appetizers include Escar
gots ($2.95) and avocado dip
with clams ($1.95).
Service is very competent. El
Pescador has a rustic, nautical
environment and a year-round
patio. The only disappointment
here was the wine list, which is
very limited and doesn't match
the caliber of the cuisine.
For lunch, El Pescador has an
extensive offering of
sandwiches, salads and seafood
dishes all g.enerous and
reasonably priced.

Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)

and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scal

($6.50), especially if you are for
tunate enough to have scallops
fresh that day. Carefully pre

from the toughness of overcook
ing.
Non-seafood fans will be

El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition to most
San Francisco seafood estab

broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere(sB.2s), Paella ($7.25)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness. Non-seafood items in
clude prime rib ($8.25), broiled
half chicken ($6.50) and Veal
Saltimbocca ($8.25), which was
written up in Sunset Magazine.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat sauce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese
($7.95) is highly recommended.
It has a fragrant garlic aroma and
a piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Six appetizers include Escar
gots ($2.95) and avocado dip
with clams ($1.95).
Service is very competent. El
Pescador has a rustic, nautical

here was the wine list, which is
very limited and doesn't match

San Francisco, renowned
mecca of seafood restaurants,
has a daily supply of the freshest
fish. Dungenness crab and sal-
when in season, are ex
jßfcremely choice. A Bay Area spe-
is abalone and when it's
properly prepared and that's
rare it is superb.
But instead of the long journey
to San Francisco or even Mon
terey for a seafood meal, three
restaurants close to campus offer
fresh fish. In general, their
menus state which dishes are
frozen seafood products (a good
rule of thumb, for example, is
that prawns are always frozen),
and which are not.
Don't be surprised if what you
want isn't available that day; av
y ailability of all seafood is subject
Aito season, weather and just plain
▼fishing luck. On the other hand,
fish recommended that day for
their freshness are usually good
bets.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
Dinners include forgettable

Romano potatoes or rice, a small
scoop of coleslaw or huge ripe
cherry tomatoes. Oddly enough,
no soup or salad is included.
A great beginning is the
savoury Manhattan-style clam
chowder (with tomatoes) at $.55
a cup, $.95 a bowl. It may not be
the "world's best, "but it is so hot
you have to wait for it to cool
down. Seafood cocktails (crab
$2.25, shrimp $1.95, combina
tion $2.15) arrive in a small bowl
with seafood sauce and lemon
wedges. Crab and shrimp louies
are available in half order
($3.25-$3.60).
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor. Fresh that day, Troll
Chinook Salmon ($6.75) was
perfectly cooked, succulent and
outstanding.
Each item of the combination
($4.95) white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good bets
are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly because
of its antiqued decor complete
with bentwood chairs and old

fishing photos, and its youthful,
cheery staff (which is extremely
efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa

San Francisco, renowned
mecca of seafood restaurants,
has a daily supply of the freshest
fish. Dungenness crab and sal-
when in season, are ex
jßfcremely choice. A Bay Area spe-
is abalone and when it's
properly prepared and that's
rare it is superb.
But instead of the long journey
to San Francisco or even Mon
terey for a seafood meal, three
restaurants close to campus offer
fresh fish. In general, their
menus state which dishes are
frozen seafood products (a good
rule of thumb, for example, is
that prawns are always frozen),
and which are not.
Don't be surprised if what you
want isn't available that day; av
y ailability of all seafood is subject
Aito season, weather and just plain
▼fishing luck. On the other hand,
fish recommended that day for
their freshness are usually good
bets.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
Dinners include forgettable

Romano potatoes or rice, a small
scoop of coleslaw or huge ripe
cherry tomatoes. Oddly enough,
no soup or salad is included.
A great beginning is the
savoury Manhattan-style clam
chowder (with tomatoes) at $.55
a cup, $.95 a bowl. It may not be
the "world's best, "but it is so hot
you have to wait for it to cool
down. Seafood cocktails (crab
$2.25, shrimp $1.95, combina
tion $2.15) arrive in a small bowl
with seafood sauce and lemon
wedges. Crab and shrimp louies
are available in half order
($3.25-$3.60).
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor. Fresh that day, Troll
Chinook Salmon ($6.75) was
perfectly cooked, succulent and
outstanding.
Each item of the combination
($4.95) white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good bets
are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly because
of its antiqued decor complete
with bentwood chairs and old

fishing photos, and its youthful,
cheery staff (which is extremely
efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Lobster from Maine crawl
around in a tank in the kitchen.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scal
lops Saute Belle Meuniere
($6.50), especially if you are for
tunate enough to have scallops
fresh that day. Carefully pre
pared, the scallops are saved
from the toughness of overcook
ing.
Non-seafood fans will be
pleased with the large selection
of beef dishes and Jade Chicken
($6.95), served with grapes.
Nice touches at The Square
Rigger include a salad crowned
with shrimp, a relish tray that
includes eggroll and fresh veg
etables and sesame bread instead
of the übiquitous sourdough.
Flatware and the house coffee
are a Hut above the ordinary.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portions aren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition to most
San Francisco seafood estab
lishments and has the most var
ied menu with the largest por

tions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere(sB.2s), Paella ($7.25)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness. Non-seafood items in
clude prime rib ($8.25), broiled
half chicken ($6.50) and Veal
Saltimbocca ($8.25), which was
written up in Sunset Magazine.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat sauce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese
($7.95) is highly recommended.
It has a fragrant garlic aroma and
a piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Six appetizers include Escar
gots ($2.95) and avocado dip
with clams ($1.95).
Service is very competent. El
Pescador has a rustic, nautical
environment and a year-round
patio. The only disappointment
here was the wine list, which is
very limited and doesn't match
the caliber of the cuisine.
For lunch, El Pescador has an
extensive offering of
sandwiches, salads and seafood
dishes all g.enerous and
reasonably priced.
