# Distinguished pizza for the discriminating connoisseur
## 
### Harry Killas 
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a wheat germ
crust, gobs of mushrooms, boun
tiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias.
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.

The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those

who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may be
jammed with five buddies into a
booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular

item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne

($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al

ways reliable for their juiciness.
Garlic bread ($.75) is another
winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality not only in
its pizzas but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive

establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices
($.60).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and
contains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounds much bet
ter than it tastes.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16 inches in diameter. A
one-item medium is $4.55; a
medium stromboli is $6.05. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese (if that
is possible) and an overly thick,

chewy crust. Toppings are not
generously portioned and if one
likes tomato sauce, request an
extra portion. Although pizza
prices are high, especially in re
lation to the meat portions, the
stromboli is notable for its
greaselessness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup of the day, submarines, deli

sandwiches and hamburgers
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beer and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss it is because it tries to be too
many things to too many people.
Even so, the thoughtful service,
great atmosphere and diverse
menu make it a place to visit of
ten. Go early on weekends to
avoid the crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes in all Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brittle
to sustain all items. A bit more
thickness would heighten the

pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their
pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is

slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but
less so with ham and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the

best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers, Saljj
tenas, the national dish
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, a huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at $.BO. The house dressing
combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but is applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups from Stan
ford sometimes entertain thereÂ®
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here a
single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.

It is not unusual for popular restaurants,
once established, to decline in quality.
Not Frankie's. Frankie's has maintained
consistently high quality in the entire
menu.

Those who know about Formico's are
not revealing their secret. It has good
food at low prices, making it tough com
petition for its rivals.

chewy crust. Toppings are not
generously portioned and if one
likes tomato sauce, request an
extra portion. Although pizza
prices are high, especially in re
lation to the meat portions, the
stromboli is notable for its
greaselessness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup of the day, submarines, deli

sandwiches and hamburgers
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beer and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss it is because it tries to be too
many things to too many people.
Even so, the thoughtful service,
great atmosphere and diverse
menu make it a place to visit of
ten. Go early on weekends to
avoid the crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes in all Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brittle
to sustain all items. A bit more
thickness would heighten the

pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their
pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is

slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but
less so with ham and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the

best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers, Saljj
tenas, the national dish
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, a huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at $.BO. The house dressing
combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but is applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups from Stan
ford sometimes entertain thereÂ®
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here a
single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.

It is not unusual for popular restaurants,
once established, to decline in quality.
Not Frankie's. Frankie's has maintained
consistently high quality in the entire
menu.

Those who know about Formico's are
not revealing their secret. It has good
food at low prices, making it tough com
petition for its rivals.

... whoever labeled pizza "junk food"
has not tried Jose's Cuban-style pizza
with a wheat-germ crust... the vegeta
rian pizza is a veritable meal in itself.


Jose prepares his pizzas himself.
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a wheat germ
crust, gobs of mushrooms, boun
tiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias.
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.

The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those

who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may be
jammed with five buddies into a
booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular

item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne

($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al

ways reliable for their juiciness.
Garlic bread ($.75) is another
winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality not only in
its pizzas but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive

establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices
($.60).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and
contains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounds much bet
ter than it tastes.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16 inches in diameter. A
one-item medium is $4.55; a
medium stromboli is $6.05. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese (if that
is possible) and an overly thick,

single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.

It is not unusual for popular restaurants,
once established, to decline in quality.
Not Frankie's. Frankie's has maintained
consistently high quality in the entire
menu.

Those who know about Formico's are
not revealing their secret. It has good
food at low prices, making it tough com
petition for its rivals.

... whoever labeled pizza "junk food"
has not tried Jose's Cuban-style pizza
with a wheat-germ crust... the vegeta
rian pizza is a veritable meal in itself.


Jose prepares his pizzas himself.
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a wheat germ
crust, gobs of mushrooms, boun
tiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias.
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.

The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those

who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may be
jammed with five buddies into a
booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular

item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne

($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al

ways reliable for their juiciness.
Garlic bread ($.75) is another
winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality not only in
its pizzas but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive

establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices
($.60).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and
contains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounds much bet
ter than it tastes.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16 inches in diameter. A
one-item medium is $4.55; a
medium stromboli is $6.05. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese (if that
is possible) and an overly thick,

chewy crust. Toppings are not
generously portioned and if one
likes tomato sauce, request an
extra portion. Although pizza
prices are high, especially in re
lation to the meat portions, the
stromboli is notable for its
greaselessness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup of the day, submarines, deli

sandwiches and hamburgers
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beer and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss it is because it tries to be too
many things to too many people.
Even so, the thoughtful service,
great atmosphere and diverse
menu make it a place to visit of
ten. Go early on weekends to
avoid the crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes in all Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brittle
to sustain all items. A bit more
thickness would heighten the

pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their
pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is

slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but
less so with ham and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the

best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers, Saljj
tenas, the national dish
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, a huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at $.BO. The house dressing
combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but is applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups from Stan
ford sometimes entertain thereÂ®
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high

Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices
($.60).
Calzone ($2.50) is like a small
pizza folded over in half and
contains sausage, onions and
cheese. Desperately needing
more sauce, it sounds much bet
ter than it tastes.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16 inches in diameter. A
one-item medium is $4.55; a
medium stromboli is $6.05. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese (if that
is possible) and an overly thick,

chewy crust. Toppings are not
generously portioned and if one
likes tomato sauce, request an
extra portion. Although pizza
prices are high, especially in re
lation to the meat portions, the
stromboli is notable for its
greaselessness.
Ramona's also offers a good
soup of the day, submarines, deli

sandwiches and hamburgers
many served with their freshly
baked bread. Ramona's exten
sive beverage list includes
juices, teas, beer and wines.
If some of Ramona's dishes
miss it is because it tries to be too
many things to too many people.
Even so, the thoughtful service,
great atmosphere and diverse
menu make it a place to visit of
ten. Go early on weekends to
avoid the crowds.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Two years ago it was cal
led VlP's.
Hidden in the shopping plaza
at the junction of Embarcadero
and Highway 101, Formico's
"specializes in all Italian foods."
The interior is dark brown and
low key with numerous Boston
ferns hanging from the ceilings.
You place orders at the front
counter and then wait for your
number to be called.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbonzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their
specialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is generously
applied and reaches close to the
edge of the pizza. Mushrooms,
green pepper and onions are
especially abundant. In fact, the
crust is a little too thin and brittle
to sustain all items. A bit more
thickness would heighten the

pizza's total impact.
Formico's Italian dinners are
served with salad, bread and cof
fee. If they are as good as their
pizza, you are in for a treat.
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzarias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is

slightly offbeat. And whoever
labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping.
But be prepared to wait longer
for a deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15
for 12 inches) is a lavish yield
from the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn, green
beans, mushrooms and the odd
pineapple speck. Huge and
thick, it is a veritable meal in it
self.
In general, pizzas here could
benefit from more cheese. Jose is
generous with pepperoni, but
less so with ham and mus
hrooms. But Jose's sauce is the

best and most distinctive of all
those sampled. Simmered "for
eight hours," it is tangy and full
of zest.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers, Saljj
tenas, the national dish
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Tossed salad, a huge plate of
crisp lettuce and tomato, is a
steal at $.BO. The house dressing
combines Italian and Blue
Cheese, but is applied too lib
erally.
The brightly colored and
cheery interior reflects the out
going personality of Jose and his
staff. Musical groups from Stan
ford sometimes entertain thereÂ®
on rowdy weekend nights.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here a
single item 12 inch pizza is $1.50
more than at Frankie's.

It is not unusual for popular restaurants,
once established, to decline in quality.
Not Frankie's. Frankie's has maintained
consistently high quality in the entire
menu.

Those who know about Formico's are
not revealing their secret. It has good
food at low prices, making it tough com
petition for its rivals.

... whoever labeled pizza "junk food"
has not tried Jose's Cuban-style pizza
with a wheat-germ crust... the vegeta
rian pizza is a veritable meal in itself.


Jose prepares his pizzas himself.
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a wheat germ
crust, gobs of mushrooms, boun
tiful meat and mozzarella
cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zarias.
Take, for instance, Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too. Just 15 mi
nutes down El Camino Real in
Mountain View, it has a reputa
tion as the students' choice.
"We're in a class of our own,"
the manager boasts and it is an
unreconstructed nerd who has
not made the trip to Frankie's at
least once this year.

The frenetic, friendly service
reflects the establishment's at
mosphere. Weekend crowds,
often waiting over an hour for
tables, teem out into El Camino.
In fact, Frankie's is not for those

who enjoy intimate dining, for
the patron is almost guaranteed
to run into at least one acquain
tance while eating. You may be
jammed with five buddies into a
booth that by right should only
seat four.
Pizzas here are 12, 14 and 16
inches. Two specialty pizzas
"Luigi's Treat" and the famous
"Stromboli" presently cost
$4, $5.50 and $6.75. Be
forewarned, however, that
prices are going up in the future.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances the
meager helping of green pepper.
The fresh-tasting tomato sauce
harmonizes well with the moz
zarella cheese and except for the
wide border around the pizza,
the crust is excellent.
Pizza may be the most popular

item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne

($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al

ways reliable for their juiciness.
Garlic bread ($.75) is another
winner.
It is not unusual for popular
restaurants, once established, to
decline in quality or to have off
nights. It is a tribute to Frankie's
that it has maintained a consis
tently high quality not only in
its pizzas but in the rest of its
menu as well.
Yet many students are content
to migrate without question to
Frankie's without considering
the convenience of three estab
lishments much closer to cam
pus.
Ramona's, for example, is just
downtown and mere minutes
away by bicycle. This attractive

establishment is distinguished
by its elegant simplicity. It is de
corated with plants and natural
woods. Well-paced and friendly
service contribute to a relaxing
atmosphere. Placed on each
table is a jar of Dijon mustard and
a pitcher of water. After dinner
mints and warmed plates further
illustrate the thoughtful

touches.
The salad buffet is an amazing
assortment of fresh vegetables
such as cherry tomatoes and bell
peppers, plus mozzarella
cheese, sprouts, mushrooms,
beans and four types of dressing.
It's $1.20 a bowl, but you may
pile it as high as you like.
Another good side order here is
the french fried potato slices
($.60).
