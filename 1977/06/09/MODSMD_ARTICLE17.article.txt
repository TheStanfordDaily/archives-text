One of the finest restaurants
serving haute cuisine is also ex
tremely close to campus. Before
it was taken over by two experi
enced restauranteurs, it used to
be called Frere Jacques.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly
an exclusive atmosphere with
out the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.

The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine
de Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange, (Meianzana a la Feta
($5.25 for two).

Chantilly is proud of the house
wines from Parducci (the Chab
lis placed first in the recent jug
tasting on campus). The admira
ble wine list has many French
vintages and fine special selec
tions from California.
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It
wasn't swamped with cheese.
And the onions and bread were

firm rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of

Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
There is a long dessert list, but
as strawberres are in season, re
quest /raises Chantilly (not on
the menu). It's a light ending to
an excellent meal.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his
policy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du
jour and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaig
rette dressing. Although strong
on French wines, the wine list
underrepresents the vineyards
of California.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a J'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesey.
Salmon Joinville ($7.75) al
though poached to perfection, is
suffocated by tough shrimp and
a rich brandy cream and paprika
sauce.
Ris de Veau Financiere

(sweetbreads in cream $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).

Inside, la Terrasse is cheery
and homey, with a young, lively
clientele. Except for a few disap
pointments in the food, it is a
restaurant you can't help liking.
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry.
Coquille St. Jacques ($2.95) are
nothing but overcooked scallops
in a tangy white wine sauce.
Entrees come with soup du
jour and salad. A la carte soupe a

I'Oignon Gratinee ($1) ex
tremely salty and undistin
guished. Rather, try Vichyssoise,
Justine's fine version of cold
potato and leek soup. The house
salads were tired and drenched
by a salty house dressing.
The menu features Abalone

($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with ice
cream, nuts and Grand Marinier
is a visual as well as taste treat.
The chef here has a heavy
hand with salt (as exemplified
by the Coquilles, onion soup and
salad dressing) and sauces —-
there's too much of both.

Although better French re
staurants than Chez Justine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch. The
incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
The waiters dash about Les
Provinces' spacious blue din
ning room of muted elegance.
FJambes and other tableside
preparations form part of the
spectacle. The experienced and
knowledgeable staff freely make
recommendations from the
well-chosen menu. Dinners are
$2 extra when served with soup,
salad and dessert.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: La mbon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
Jean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his
seasonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with
garlic and the meaty ham crepes

($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish or
Maine lobster ($2.75).
All the salads are tossed at
your table with flair. Green salad
with roquefort ($1.75) is good.
But the mushroom salad ($2.75)
is superb. Totally unblemished
white mushrooms with herbs on
a bed of butter lettuce, it is visu
ally appealing as well.
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse

($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed'with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot plaze. It is a
model of its kind.

Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only nine months old,
it shows consistency in all areas
of its menu.
The cuisines of France and

Italy harmonize well at Liason.
The French country inn atmos
phere misses just a little, but the
lively clientele compensates.
The service may lack the "slick
ness" of Les Provinces, but the
waiters are more personable.
Furthermore, Liaison serves the
best Italian food in the area.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pastas
resisted just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.

Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little
glutinous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal is white
and milk fed you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise(sB.so) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Desserts include Zabaione for
two ($4), and two superior
treatments of old favorites:
Chocolate Mousse ($1.50) and a
silky caramel custard, ($.25).
Liaison's portions are larger than
the other restaurants, but you
don't have to struggle for de
ssert.

Chantilly is that type of restaurant you'd
like to keep a secret ... an exclusive
atmosphere, without the pretention of
other top-flight places.

... don't miss the Sunday Champagne
Brunch at Chez Justine. It is a Bay Area
legend an incredible buffet.

Except for a few disappointments in the
food, la Terrasse is a restaurant you
can't help liking.

Les Provinces' house specialty the
apple tart is a model of its kind. And
their veal is white and milkfed you
won't find better anywhere.
