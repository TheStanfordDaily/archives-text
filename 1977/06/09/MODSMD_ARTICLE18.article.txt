# The 						Mandarin mode
## A 						different style of Chinese food 
### 
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Three are within hiking dis
tance. At all these establish
ments, waiters are willing to re
commend dishes that would
complement each other (such as
the mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cooking
| in the area.
Chu's eggrolls ($1.30 for two),
for example, are packed with
pork, bean sprouts and bamboo
shoots. They are notable because
the batter is not greasy from the
deep-fry. The more adventurous
should try the five spice beef, a
cold Mandarin appetizer with an
intriguing taste.
One of the soups, hot and sour
($1.95) boasts crisp vegetables in
a thick broth with bean curd and
1 just enough vinegar.
One shouldn't miss the mu
Shu pork which is definitevely
' done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
| from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are gener
ously served in an irresistable
tomato-cherry sauce with scall
rions and chopped onions.
•Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
* of morsels of boneless chicken —
quick-fried in hot oil and spices
with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
place to dine, especially

with a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
Once inside, you are hidden
from the buzz of El Camino by
the informal and serene atmos
phere. Ask for a table that faces
the beautiful outdoor garden.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef Chu's,

but the portions are smaller. One
is advised to order an extra bowl
of rice. Service is attentive.
China Lion's hot and sour
soup arrive piping hot, but
needs more pepper and vinegar.
A far more worthy starter is the
sizzling rice soup.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices and
crisp green pepper accented
with peanuts. Prawns in hot
sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat —the prawns are not
shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here
are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
China Lion is a fine place to
start familizarizing oneself with
the cuisine of Hunan.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First, next to the Holiday
Inn, has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards

such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must
be ordered in advance.
Although listed as a specialty,
the Lake Tung Ting shrimp is a
bland melange of water
chestnuts, mushrooms and
shrimp in egg. At $4.95, the serv
ing of shrimps is not generous.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour

is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) sizzling rice with
chicken, ham, shrimp and veg
etables in a rich chicken broth—
is memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals's chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced tender
chicken in a bed of crunch snow
peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions at
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare with
Chef Chu's. China First is very

close to campus and makes a
pleasant evening out for a date or
visiting parents who want some
thing other than steak and salad
for dinner.
Have you ever wondered
about the Chinese kitchen hid
den in the Town and Gountry
Village? Don't pass up the Hsi-
Nan. It serves some of the best
Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants "the way
the dishes should be prepared,"
says the owner. Moreover, he
will alter the degree of hotness to
suit the customer's taste.
It is commendable that dishes
do not arrive all at once at the
Hsi-Nan. Pot stickers ($1.95 for
six), although a little oily, are
noodles containing tasty ground
pork and vegetables. A large tu
reen of pork and Chinese turnip
soup is ($2.25) subtly blended
bamboo shoots, mushrooms, the
turnip and pork.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) was extremely tender
and a must for those who enjoy
hot black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied all of which make
Hsi-Nan a good buy in the Stan
ford area.

Chef Chu's is extremely popular it
combines uncommonly good service
with some of the best Chinese cooking
in the area.
