# Zeroing in .... on Stanford, Palo Alto, the Bay Area
## 
### 
Welcome... to Stanford, if you are from the local
area, to Palo Alto, if you are from the surrounding
region, to the Bay Area if you come from farther
afield.
It is certainly no overstatement to say that if this
area suffers from anything, it is an embarassment of
riches. A guide for summer visitors which would
purport to explore all the resources of the campus,
let alone those of Palo Alto (and it goes without
saying that the limitless possibilities of the Bay
Area would fill volumes) would be a deception. In
both depth and breadth, Stanford's resources are
beyond the conception of one mind.
What this guide attempts, then, is to provide the
most general overview possible, so that when the
visitor is faced with the difficult task of budgeting
his time, he has some basis on which to do so.
Enjoy your stay and remember — if you are bored,
you are doing something wrong.
