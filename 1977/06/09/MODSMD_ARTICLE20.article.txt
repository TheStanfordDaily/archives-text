# THE 						BAY AREA
## Paying homage to The City: a sight-seer's guide 
### 
San Francisco is the biggest
tourist attraction in northern
California, and it deserves to be
treated with respect. No matter
how long one plans to be in the
Bay Area this summer, one
should pay homage to the city at
least once.
The descriptions and sugges
tions offered here are by no
means complete. For more de
tails (and lots of brochures), we
suggest contacting the San Fran
cisco Convention 'and Visitors
Bureau, 1390 Market St., (415)
626-5500.
The bureau sports a Visitor In
formation Center in Benjamin H.
Swig Pavilion, Hallidie Plaza,
Powell and Market Streets. Lo
cated on the lower level di
rectly opposite the BART station
â€”it is open from 8 a.m. to 5:30
p.m.
There are several important
things to remember while visit
ing San Francisco. The worst
thing one can do is identify one
self to the natives as a tourist.
And the best way to do that is to
refer to the place as "Frisco."
Calling it "SF" won't get one
much further. Only Herb Caen

can get away with "Baghdad by
the Bay."
While "San Francisco" may
sound unwieldy when used in
every other sentence, it is the ac
cepted term.
To save a little breath, "the
Gity" is permitted. True, there
are dozens of cities around here,
but only one merits capitaliza
tion.
While we're on the topic of
things one doesn't do in San
Francisco, perhaps we should
discuss one more. While on the
cable cars, do not sing the Rice
a-Roni theme song. Don't even
whistle it, no matter how strong
the temptation. It's considered
very tacky.
Now. What does one do in the
City?
Cable Cars: Three different
lines serve the City. The fare is
25 cents, and you can ask for a
transfer, which is good on any
cable car, street or bus.
Powell-Hyde starts at the
turntable at Powell and Market,
climbs Nob Hill, turns west, and
turns around at Victorian Park,
next to Ghiradelli Square.
Powell-Mason starts at Market

Street, goes up Nob Hill and
through North Beach to Bay
Street, near Fisherman's Wharf.
California Street travels in a
straight line from California and
Market to Van Ness, going
through the Financial District
and Chinatown.
Chinatown: An area best
traveled on foot. Located on a
section of Grant Ave., near
Union Square, it includes many
gift shops, groceries and herb
dealers, and a fortune cookie fac
tory.
Coit Tower: At the top of Tele
graph Hill, this is one of the ci
ty's best lookout spots, with a
panoramic view of the bay. Get
there by following Lombard
Street up the hill.
Crookedest Street in the
World: On Russian Hill, a
block-long portion of Lombard
street drops from Hyde to
Leavenworth, zig-zagging back
and forth several times. It is
one-way, downhill.
Fisherman's Wharf: Fishing
boats, seafood, museums, T-shirt
shops, amusement arcades, Rip
ley's "Believe It or Not" estab
lishment, street artists, street

musicians and lots of assorted
interesting characters. Not to be
missed, even if all you do is walk
around and stare. The main in
tersection is Taylor and Jefferson
Street, and it is a short walk from
either the Cannery or Ghirardelli
Square.
40-mile drive: If you've got at
least three hours free and lots of
gas in your tank, you might like
this scenic drive which winds
through the city, passing many
of the more popular parts of
town. Follow the signs with the
seagull on them.
Ghirardelli Square (and the
Cannery and Victorian Park):
Many more shops, galleries, sin
gers, restaurants and un
employed musicians. Visit the
Maritime Museum at the foot of
Polk Street and the Wine
Museum on Beach Street near
Hyde Street.
Golden Gate Bridge: The coun
try's most visited landmark, the
bridge joins the Peninsula with
Marin County and points north.
The best view is from the park
ing plaza, but if you want to walk
across on foot, it won't cost you
anything.
Golden Gate Park: A surpris
ingly well-kept park in the mid
dle of the city. It covers more

than 1000 acres and extends
from Arguello Boulevard to the
ocean. Filled with bike and bri
dle paths, lakes, meadows and
playfields. Places to visit in
clude the M.H. DeYoung
Museum, Japanese Tea Garden,
arboretum and Hall of Flowers,
California Academy of Sciences
and Asian Art Museum. Boats
are available for rent at Stow
Lake.
Haight Street: Remember the
good old days of Haight-
Ashbury? This is where it all
started, legend says. It's changed
now, of course, but you can still
find interesting stores, people
and atmosphere. Go from Haight
and Stanyan to Haight and
Masonic.
Hyatt Regency Hotel: Divine
decadence that has to be seen to
be believed. Go up a couple of
floors to the inside courtyard
and gawk at the architecture and
artwork. Dress in something be
sides jeans. California and Mar
ket.
Japantown: An area filled
with Japanese groceries, import
stores, restaurants, newspapers,
temples and shrines. Visit Japan
Center, too, which includes a
Japanese style hotel, restaurants,
manufacturers' showrooms, and

a theatre. It is bounded by Geary,
Post, Laguna, and Fillmore
Streets.
Nob Hill: An area rich in
beautiful architecture, it used to
be the home of San Francisco's
elite crowd, which included Le
land Stanford Sr. Take Sac
ramento Street up from
Chinatown.
North Beach: Lots of enter
tainment and night life.
Theatres, Italian restaurants,
boutiques, etc. Lots of strip

joints, porno flicks, and bars are
centered around Columbus and
Broadway.
Twin Peaks: 910 feet high,
they offer a great view of every
thing, day or night. Located in
the middle of the City.
Union Square: Lots of high
class shopping in the area. Four
levels of parking are available
under the square, which is
bounded by Post, Stockton,
Geary and Powell Streets.
