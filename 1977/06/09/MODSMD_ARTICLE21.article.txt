San Francisco has an ex
traordinarily large number of
excellent restaurants, and an
equal number of restaurant
reviewers. Still, I have two
favorites, which ought not be
missed.
The first is Mammovnia, at
4411 Balboa Street (752-
6566). Mammovia has the
best Moroccan food in The
City, and the atmosphere (you
recline on cushions and eat
with your fingers) is unusu
ally pleasant. Reservations

are required, and since it is
very popular, you should
make them as early as possi
ble.
In Chinatown the Hunan
(853 Kearny) serves spicy
foods from the Chinese pro
vince of the same name. The
cuisine, unless you are ad
verse to peppers, is unique,
tasty and addicting. Shred
ded chicken salad is a must,
along with one of the smoked
dishes. No reservations, but
go early (its always crowded).
Closed Saturday and Sunday.
