# Around the Bay Area -and beyond
## 
### 
There is a great deal to be said for San
Francisco, but no speech on the subject of the
Bay Area should stop there. The final word
has not been spoken unless the names of
such localities as Sausalito, Berkeley and
Oakland have been mentioned, and a truly
complete listing would include the more
far-flung designations of the Napa Valley,
Santa Cruz, Monterey and Carmel as well.
Water is the most significant geographical
factor around the Bay Area (that label is no
accident). Just the few splashes necessary to
fill the Golden Gate are enough to put Marin
County in its own world, untouched by the
urban sprawl of San Francisco.
This is the original land of drought and
water-rationing and after making the breezy
and breath-taking trip across the Big Bridge,
the tourist will have no trouble believing
that arid fact. The chaparral-covered hills
appear as empty of life as the metropolis on
the other side is full.
Tamalpais
Mill Valley is the first town which the
motorist heading north on Route 1 will
reach. It is a pleasant enough medium-sized
community, but greater attractions lie
beyond. A narrow, winding road climbs out
of Mill Valley and up the side of Mount

Tamalpais (pronounced Tam-al-pie-as).
This peak in itself makes a trip to Marin
worthwhile with a state park perched at its
summit and the Pacific Ocean crashing at its
foot.
Stinson Beach has traditionally been a
community for the rich and misanthropic,
and after the drought replaced the energy
crisis as the Number One Source of Impend
ing Doom, the residents of that ocean-front
stretch let it be known that they would not
welcome any water-consuming tourists. It is
a beautiful place nonetheless, and makes a
fine destination for those who want to see
what is on the far side of Tamalpais.
Ferrying
Sausalito is also in its own world, al
though probably as much by choice as by
geography. It has a considerable amount of
romantic charm and is worth the ferry ride
across the Bay. Also worth a ferry ride is
Angel Island formerly a military base and
now an unspoiled state park.
Berkeley is a University town and in many
people's opinion, it exemplifies all the best
aspects of that type of community. It is not so
large that it suffers from urban impersonal
ity, and it is not so small it causes the bore
dom of a two-bar town. The University of

California campus ranks with the best
integrated college locales of the East and
merges harmoniously with the foothills at its
rear.
Sports
If the city of Oakland were placed any
where other than next to San Francisco, it
would probably be a much-esteemed city. As
it is, few sight-seers cross the Bay Bridge to
explore its spacious streets. It does have a
respectable entertainment district centered
around Jack London Square and of course, a
professional sports team for every season.
The Napa Valley is about two hours north
by car, but it boasts California's best wine
country and a pleasant day can be had in
making a tasting-tour.
To the south, Santa Cruz offers a different,
but equally attractive, example of a Univer
sity of California campus. The town itself is
very relaxed and is the home of one of the ten
best roller-coasters in the country. To its
immediate north and south are a number of
excellent beaches.
Monterey and Carmel are actually outside
the Bay Area's sphere of influence, but both
are extraordinarily charming. The shopping,
the restaurants and the hostelry should be
sufficient inducement to make the two and a
half hour drive.

far-flung designations of the Napa Valley,
Santa Cruz, Monterey and Carmel as well.
Water is the most significant geographical
factor around the Bay Area (that label is no
accident). Just the few splashes necessary to
fill the Golden Gate are enough to put Marin
County in its own world, untouched by the
urban sprawl of San Francisco.
This is the original land of drought and
water-rationing and after making the breezy
and breath-taking trip across the Big Bridge,
the tourist will have no trouble believing
that arid fact. The chaparral-covered hills
appear as empty of life as the metropolis on
the other side is full.
Tamalpais
Mill Valley is the first town which the
motorist heading north on Route 1 will
reach. It is a pleasant enough medium-sized
community, but greater attractions lie
beyond. A narrow, winding road climbs out
of Mill Valley and up the side of Mount

Tamalpais (pronounced Tam-al-pie-as).
This peak in itself makes a trip to Marin
worthwhile with a state park perched at its
summit and the Pacific Ocean crashing at its
foot.
Stinson Beach has traditionally been a
community for the rich and misanthropic,
and after the drought replaced the energy
crisis as the Number One Source of Impend
ing Doom, the residents of that ocean-front
stretch let it be known that they would not
welcome any water-consuming tourists. It is
a beautiful place nonetheless, and makes a
fine destination for those who want to see
what is on the far side of Tamalpais.
Ferrying
Sausalito is also in its own world, al
though probably as much by choice as by
geography. It has a considerable amount of
romantic charm and is worth the ferry ride
across the Bay. Also worth a ferry ride is
Angel Island formerly a military base and
now an unspoiled state park.
Berkeley is a University town and in many
people's opinion, it exemplifies all the best
aspects of that type of community. It is not so
large that it suffers from urban impersonal
ity, and it is not so small it causes the bore
dom of a two-bar town. The University of

California campus ranks with the best
integrated college locales of the East and
merges harmoniously with the foothills at its
rear.
Sports
If the city of Oakland were placed any
where other than next to San Francisco, it
would probably be a much-esteemed city. As
it is, few sight-seers cross the Bay Bridge to
explore its spacious streets. It does have a
respectable entertainment district centered
around Jack London Square and of course, a
professional sports team for every season.
The Napa Valley is about two hours north
by car, but it boasts California's best wine
country and a pleasant day can be had in
making a tasting-tour.
To the south, Santa Cruz offers a different,
but equally attractive, example of a Univer
sity of California campus. The town itself is
very relaxed and is the home of one of the ten
best roller-coasters in the country. To its
immediate north and south are a number of
excellent beaches.
Monterey and Carmel are actually outside
the Bay Area's sphere of influence, but both
are extraordinarily charming. The shopping,
the restaurants and the hostelry should be
sufficient inducement to make the two and a
half hour drive.
There is a great deal to be said for San
Francisco, but no speech on the subject of the
Bay Area should stop there. The final word
has not been spoken unless the names of
such localities as Sausalito, Berkeley and
Oakland have been mentioned, and a truly
complete listing would include the more
far-flung designations of the Napa Valley,
Santa Cruz, Monterey and Carmel as well.
