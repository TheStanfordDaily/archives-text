# Local vintners offer varied tours

"Wine is constant proof that
God loves to see us happy." That
witticism by Benjamin Franklin
hangs on a placard in the tasting
room of the Brookside Winery,
on El Camino Real in Mountain
View. The Brookside and other
local wineries are proof that one
doesn't have to drive two hours
to Napa Valley to visit good
wineries.
Brookside is a quiet, low
pressure winery: visitors are
under no pressure to buy, but are
encouraged to browse, taste and
ask questions.
Visitors may taste virtually
anything they want, except for
the brandies, and manager
Claude Anisodon's friendliness
and thorough knowledge make
Brookside a worthwhile trip.
Something for everyone
Brookside features over 100
varieties of wine, which it sells
through its own outlets, restaur
ants or to churches for altar

wines. This keeps the prices
down. The variety also means
that there is something for
everyone; as wine-tasting host
Michael Miller says. "We make
wine for everybody. No matter
what types you're looking for,
here you can find it."
And Brookside will buy back
for 10 cents its old half-gallon
and gallon bottles for recycling
a feature unique to that win
ery.
Brookside's estate wines are
among its best. These are native
to Brookside, and one, called
"Guasti Chocolate," has won a
gold medal at the Los Angeles
Fair.
Masson commercial
The Paul Masson Winery in
Saratoga offers a totally different
experience from Brookside. Its
operations are much bigger and
cater to tourists, and hence, are
much more commercial.
While the tour is excellent,
Masson's tasting room is not. In

spite of the many varieties of
wines, only a few are available
for tasting on any given day it
depends on what type the win
ery opens that day.
A little-known but wonder
fully quaint winery lies in the
Los Gatos hills. Called the
Novitiate, it was founded in
1888 by Jesuit priests, who still
do much of the work.
The Novitiate is strictly a
non-profit enterprise, supplying
altar wines for Catholic churches
in the U.S. and supporting re
tirement homes for old priests.
The priests run a very small,
personal operation; their volume
is about 135,000 gallons a year
and they only make about 20
types of wine. But visitors can
taste as much as they like of any
thing they like with free
breadsticks to make a light meal.
And unlike the completely

modern equipment of Paul Mas
son, the Novitiate has a small,
classic wine cellar with old bar
rels in racks. One of their larger
barrels was recently sold to A
man who built a house from i'|
Specialty fruit wines
Bargetto's winery, in Soquel,
offers a mixture of the Italian
family touch large factory opera
tions. Tours are informal just
ask.
The tasting room is worth the
hour's drive. Senior wine coun
selor Pat Ballard handles the
always-busy room with remark
able dexterity; every customer is
given a completely organized
"tour" through wines, from "vin
ordinaire" to fruit and
wine. Visitors can taste anything
but the most expensive wines
Fruit wines are Bargetto's spe
cialty.
