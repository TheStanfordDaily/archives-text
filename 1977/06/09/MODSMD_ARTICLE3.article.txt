# THE
						CAMPUS
## Navigating in the maze: a guide to the landmarks How to find those elusive spots with the aid of twenty one prominent buildings and other manmade features... and the reasons for finding them. 
### 
The Campus is not wholly dis
similar to a maze. And when the
casual visitor or even semi
permanent resident finds him
self in a hurry to go somewhere,
he is frequently astonished at
how much labyrinthine charac
ter the Stanford environs can ac
quire. Areas which seemed sim
ple and easily negotiated when
described turn into bewildering
obstacle courses full of unex
pected obstructions and dead
ends.
Maps are often more hindr
ance than help. Buildings which
may look like nice simple
squares from above can appear
as anything but square from a
visitor's-eye ground view. Even
worse, the construction rate
being what it is these days, the
cartographer is hard put to keep
up with the contractor so that
Irven the latest projections are
missing two or three very large
and awkwardly placed new
buildings.
The following is a list of cam
pus landmarks which should
help alleviate the situation. In
addition to orienting the reader
through a combined schematic
and pictorial approach, it should
further expedite passage around
campus by explicitly identifying
a number of popular destina
tions as well as outlining the
reasons why they are commonly
visited.

HL Memorial Church.
'Mem Chu, one of the first victims
of the binomial three-letter ab
breviation system, serves as the
primary reference point of the
campus. Defined as being the

exact center of the Stanford uni
verse, the church is located in
the Inner Quadrangle. Erected in
1903 as a memorial to founder
Leland Stanford Sr., Mem Chu
was virtually destroyed in the
1906 earthquake, but was re
stored in 1913. The church
mosaics are from the Salviati
studio in Venice, while the
stained-glass windows were de
signed by Lamb of New Jersey.

2. Lomita Mall. The Physics
Lecture Hall, or "physics tank,"
is the most prominent fixture of
the science and engineering
buildings lining Lomita Mall.
Constructed in 1957, the circular
hall was financed by University
royalties on the Klystron tube, a
primary component of radar and
electron linear accelerators. It
has two lecture demonstration
theaters and several classrooms.
At the top of Lomita Mall is the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing which houses a library, a
map collection, offices and
laboratories.

3. Science buildings. This sec

tion of campus includes five
separate buildings for chemistry
and chemical engineering and
two biology buildings. Included
in the chemistry complex are the
Chemistry Building (built in
1900, of the same vintage as the
Quad), the Organic Chemistry
Laboratory (the organic profes
sor's bastion against the insati
able hordes of knowledge
hungry pre-meds), the
three Stauffer Laboratores (one
each for chemistry research,
physical chemistry and chemi
cal engineering), and the latest
addition to the family, the Seeley
G. Mudd Chemistry Building
(everyone's favorite baby).
The Herrin biology complex
consists of one building for
graduate training and research
and another which houses a lib
rary, classroom-laboratories
and an auditorium.

4. The Medical Center. The
Medical Center houses the
School of Medicine and the
Stanford Hospital. Its three
story buildings, connected by
arcades, enclose 16 acres of floor
space. Dedicated in 1959, it
houses among other things the
Lane Medical Library, the
largest collection of medical
books and documents in the
West.
The most recent addition to
the Medical Center is the Sher
man Fairchild Center which in
cludes a building for research
and a 400 seat auditorium.
