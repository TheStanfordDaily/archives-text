# THE 						CAMPUS
## Navigating in the maze: a guide to the landmarks How to find those elusive spots with the aid of twenty one prominent buildings and other manmade features... and the reasons for finding them. 
### 
The Campus is not wholly dis
similar to a maze. And when the
casual visitor or even semi
permanent resident finds him
self in a hurry to go somewhere,
he is frequently astonished at
how much labyrinthine charac
ter the Stanford environs can ac
quire. Areas which seemed sim
ple and easily negotiated when
described turn into bewildering
obstacle courses full of unex
pected obstructions and dead
ends.
Maps are often more hindr
ance than help. Buildings which
may look like nice simple
squares from above can appear
as anything but square from a
visitor's-eye ground view. Even
worse, the construction rate
being what it is these days, the
cartographer is hard put to keep
up with the contractor so that
Irven the latest projections are
missing two or three very large
and awkwardly placed new
buildings.
The following is a list of cam
pus landmarks which should
help alleviate the situation. In
addition to orienting the reader
through a combined schematic
and pictorial approach, it should
further expedite passage around
campus by explicitly identifying
a number of popular destina
tions as well as outlining the
reasons why they are commonly
visited.

HL Memorial Church.
'Mem Chu, one of the first victims
of the binomial three-letter ab
breviation system, serves as the
primary reference point of the
campus. Defined as being the

exact center of the Stanford uni
verse, the church is located in
the Inner Quadrangle. Erected in
1903 as a memorial to founder
Leland Stanford Sr., Mem Chu
was virtually destroyed in the
1906 earthquake, but was re
stored in 1913. The church
mosaics are from the Salviati
studio in Venice, while the
stained-glass windows were de
signed by Lamb of New Jersey.

2. Lomita Mall. The Physics
Lecture Hall, or "physics tank,"
is the most prominent fixture of
the science and engineering
buildings lining Lomita Mall.
Constructed in 1957, the circular
hall was financed by University
royalties on the Klystron tube, a
primary component of radar and
electron linear accelerators. It
has two lecture demonstration
theaters and several classrooms.
At the top of Lomita Mall is the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing which houses a library, a
map collection, offices and
laboratories.

3. Science buildings. This sec

tion of campus includes five
separate buildings for chemistry
and chemical engineering and
two biology buildings. Included
in the chemistry complex are the
Chemistry Building (built in
1900, of the same vintage as the
Quad), the Organic Chemistry
Laboratory (the organic profes
sor's bastion against the insati
able hordes of knowledge
hungry pre-meds), the
three Stauffer Laboratores (one
each for chemistry research,
physical chemistry and chemi
cal engineering), and the latest
addition to the family, the Seeley
G. Mudd Chemistry Building
(everyone's favorite baby).
The Herrin biology complex
consists of one building for
graduate training and research
and another which houses a lib
rary, classroom-laboratories
and an auditorium.

4. The Medical Center. The
Medical Center houses the
School of Medicine and the
Stanford Hospital. Its three
story buildings, connected by
arcades, enclose 16 acres of floor
space. Dedicated in 1959, it
houses among other things the
Lane Medical Library, the
largest collection of medical
books and documents in the
West.
The most recent addition to
the Medical Center is the Sher
man Fairchild Center which in
cludes a building for research
and a 400 seat auditorium.






The numbers on this map of the central part of campus correspond to those of the descriptions and pictures.
Across Campus Drive is the
Anatomy Building, a less-than
glamorous sprawling collection
of laboratories, classrooms and
offices.
Not part of the Medical Center
but in the vicinity is Jordan
Quad, location of the Communi
cation and Computer' Depart
ments.

5. The Stanford Museum. The
final resting place for much of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, the museum in
cludes exhibits of painting and
sculpture as well as relics of Le
land Stanford Jr.'s childhood.
The museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to
4:45 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

6. The Stadium. Stanford
Stadium, built in 1921, is still
one of the larger stadia in the
United States (capacity 89,500).
It sometimes fail to fill even for
the "Big" Cal games. A

quarter-mile track with a 220-
yard straightaway encloses the
football field.

7. The Maples-deGuerre
complex. The deGuerre Pools
and Courts provide three pools
fof recreational use, squash and
handball courts, and a 2500 seat
grandstand and were completed
in 1973. Near deGuerre is the
Roscoe Maple Pavillion, which
holds 8,500 persons for basket
ball games, other athletic con
tests and large campus events of
the rock concert variety. It was
dedicated in 1969.

Also in the vicinity is the Sun
ken Diamond for baseball, var
sity tennis courts and playing
fields for soccer, lacrosse, and
whatever sports the University's
athletes care to indulge in.

8. Encina Gym. In addition to
lockers, showers and training
facilities, the Gym has facilities
for weight-lifting, wrestling and
gymnastics, as well as a well
stocked sporting-goods store and
offices.

9. The Graduate School of
Business. The Graduate School
of Business was dedicated in
1966. Its major components, in
addition to office and study
facilities, are the Roth Center for
Advanced Management, the
Sloan Center for Management
Education, the 350 seat Bishop
Auditorium, and the Jackson
Library. The "biz school" cur
rently is considered, and con
siders itself, the best in the coun
try.

10. Memorial Auditorium
Mem Aud, as it is universally
known, was built primarily
through student contributions.
Dedicated in 1937 as a memorial
to Stanford students and facul
ties who died in World War I, it
has since become a memorial to
the dead of World War II as well.
The main auditorium seats 1760
and there is a 200 seat Little The
ater. Also located in Mem Aud
are the Drama Department and
KZSU, the student-run radio sta
tion (90.1 on the FM dial).

11. Hoover Tower. Easily the
most prominent campus erec
tion, Hoover Tower houses the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution, and Peace. Adjoining
the tower is the Lou Henry
Hoover Building, opened in
1967 to provide additional space
for the Institution's collections
and activities.

12. The Art Building and Gal
lery. The Cummings Art Build
ing houses the art and architec
ture library as well as studios
and classrooms. The 350 seat
Annenberg Auditorium is lo
cated on the lowest level. Next
door to the art building is the Art
Gallery, the location of
periodically-changing art
exhibits.

13. The Main Library. Until
last year the million book re
pository was known simply as
the Main Library; Now it is
named for Cecil H. Green, the
largest single donor to what will
soon (two years) be an exten
sively ($2O million) remodeled
and expanded edition. The orig

inal library was built in 1919 and
includes several special collec
tions (music, maps, theatre,
among others); as well as period
ical, government documents and
microtext departments. The En
gineering Library is located on
the first floor.

14. Cubberley. Known offi
cially as the School of Educa
tion, the building takes its com
mon name from the 500 seat au
ditorium located on the first
floor. The rest of the building
houses classrooms and offices.

15. UGLY. Officially named J.
Henry Meyer Library, the under
graduate library, by an inspired
stroke of acronymicry, has been
renamed UGLY. Featuring study
space for 1500 and windows
which do not open and can not
be washed, UGLY provides
space for classrooms, language
laboratories and stacks in addi
tions to normal library facilities.

16. SCRDT. Winner of the
Most Unpronounceable Ac
ronym on Campus Award, the

Stanford Center for Develop
ment and Research in Teaching
is one of the most advanced
facilities of its kind anywhere.
Its sophisticated audio-visual
equipment is used for research
in the psychology of learning.
LOTS (acronymic for low
overhead time sharing) compu
ter terminals are located on the
ground floor, providing a valu
able supplement to the teaching
terminals of the University's
main computer system which
are located in Pine Hall in Jordan
Quad.

17. The Law School. The Law
School Complex consists of four
separate units linked together
under the Crown Quadrangle,
named in honor of the Henry
Crown family: Crown Library
(known as the most comfortable
library at Stanford), Richmond
Hall (class and seminar rooms)
the James Irvine Gallery (faculty
and student meeting rooms and
lounges), and Kresge Au
ditorium (capacity 530).

18. The Row. The Row was
formerly comprised exclusively
of fraternity and sorority houses.
Now, though there are stiM a few
frat houses, most houses have
become coed, female, or inde
pendent. Sororities at Stanford
were banned in the 19405.

19. White Plaza. White Memo

rial Plaza is built around a 16
foot free-form fountain in the
center of the plaza ("the claw")
sculpted by Aristides Demetrios
of San Francisco.
At one end of the landscaped
Plaza is Tresidder Memorial Un
ion, dedicated in 1962 and
named for Stanford's fourth
president, Donald B. Tresidder.
The union—open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. until
midnight (10 a.m. on Saturday
and Sunday)—serves as a cam
pus community center.
Facing the Union is the 720
seat Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
dedicated in 1957, which houses
facilities for the Department of
Music and which serves as a lec
ture and performance hall.
Also on the Plaza are a number
of student service buildings: the
Old Union (offices of the Dean of
Student Affairs, Registrar, and
Admissions), the Bookstore,
Post Office (Zip Code 94305),
Career Planning and Placement
center, and Clubhouse (for stu
dent religious and other organi
zations).

20. Roble Field. Traditionally
thought of as the women's sports
complex, Roble Gymnasium,
swimming pool and tennis
courts are included in the area.
The Gym houses a basketball
court, and a dance studio as well
as lockers, showers, and offices.

21. Stop sign. Far from unique
in this area (as those with autos
will have already discovered)
this stop sign is located at a very
strategic point: it is half way
along the best short-cut between
"upper" and "lower" campus.
The "upper" entrance is located
behind Roble Gym and the
"lower" entrance is accessible
only by two improbable feeder
streets which turn off Serra
Street.

















The Campus is not wholly dis
similar to a maze. And when the
casual visitor or even semi
permanent resident finds him
self in a hurry to go somewhere,
he is frequently astonished at
how much labyrinthine charac
ter the Stanford environs can ac
quire. Areas which seemed sim
ple and easily negotiated when
described turn into bewildering
obstacle courses full of unex
pected obstructions and dead
ends.
Maps are often more hindr
ance than help. Buildings which
may look like nice simple
squares from above can appear
as anything but square from a
visitor's-eye ground view. Even
worse, the construction rate
being what it is these days, the
cartographer is hard put to keep
up with the contractor so that
Irven the latest projections are
missing two or three very large
and awkwardly placed new
buildings.
The following is a list of cam

15. UGLY. Officially named J.
Henry Meyer Library, the under
graduate library, by an inspired
stroke of acronymicry, has been
renamed UGLY. Featuring study
space for 1500 and windows
which do not open and can not
be washed, UGLY provides
space for classrooms, language
laboratories and stacks in addi
tions to normal library facilities.

16. SCRDT. Winner of the
Most Unpronounceable Ac
ronym on Campus Award, the

Stanford Center for Develop
ment and Research in Teaching
is one of the most advanced
facilities of its kind anywhere.
Its sophisticated audio-visual
equipment is used for research
in the psychology of learning.
LOTS (acronymic for low
overhead time sharing) compu
ter terminals are located on the
ground floor, providing a valu
able supplement to the teaching
terminals of the University's
main computer system which
are located in Pine Hall in Jordan
Quad.

17. The Law School. The Law
School Complex consists of four
separate units linked together
under the Crown Quadrangle,
named in honor of the Henry
Crown family: Crown Library
(known as the most comfortable
library at Stanford), Richmond
Hall (class and seminar rooms)
the James Irvine Gallery (faculty
and student meeting rooms and
lounges), and Kresge Au
ditorium (capacity 530).

18. The Row. The Row was
formerly comprised exclusively
of fraternity and sorority houses.
Now, though there are stiM a few
frat houses, most houses have
become coed, female, or inde
pendent. Sororities at Stanford
were banned in the 19405.

19. White Plaza. White Memo

rial Plaza is built around a 16
foot free-form fountain in the
center of the plaza ("the claw")
sculpted by Aristides Demetrios
of San Francisco.
At one end of the landscaped
Plaza is Tresidder Memorial Un
ion, dedicated in 1962 and
named for Stanford's fourth
president, Donald B. Tresidder.
The union—open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. until
midnight (10 a.m. on Saturday
and Sunday)—serves as a cam
pus community center.
Facing the Union is the 720
seat Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
dedicated in 1957, which houses
facilities for the Department of
Music and which serves as a lec
ture and performance hall.
Also on the Plaza are a number
of student service buildings: the
Old Union (offices of the Dean of
Student Affairs, Registrar, and
Admissions), the Bookstore,
Post Office (Zip Code 94305),
Career Planning and Placement
center, and Clubhouse (for stu
dent religious and other organi
zations).

20. Roble Field. Traditionally
thought of as the women's sports
complex, Roble Gymnasium,
swimming pool and tennis
courts are included in the area.
The Gym houses a basketball
court, and a dance studio as well
as lockers, showers, and offices.

21. Stop sign. Far from unique
in this area (as those with autos
will have already discovered)
this stop sign is located at a very
strategic point: it is half way
along the best short-cut between
"upper" and "lower" campus.
The "upper" entrance is located
behind Roble Gym and the
"lower" entrance is accessible
only by two improbable feeder
streets which turn off Serra
Street.

















The Campus is not wholly dis
similar to a maze. And when the
casual visitor or even semi
permanent resident finds him
self in a hurry to go somewhere,
he is frequently astonished at
how much labyrinthine charac
ter the Stanford environs can ac
quire. Areas which seemed sim
ple and easily negotiated when
described turn into bewildering
obstacle courses full of unex
pected obstructions and dead
ends.
Maps are often more hindr
ance than help. Buildings which
may look like nice simple
squares from above can appear
as anything but square from a
visitor's-eye ground view. Even
worse, the construction rate
being what it is these days, the
cartographer is hard put to keep
up with the contractor so that
Irven the latest projections are
missing two or three very large
and awkwardly placed new
buildings.
The following is a list of cam
pus landmarks which should
help alleviate the situation. In
addition to orienting the reader
through a combined schematic
and pictorial approach, it should
further expedite passage around
campus by explicitly identifying
a number of popular destina
tions as well as outlining the
reasons why they are commonly
visited.

HL Memorial Church.
'Mem Chu, one of the first victims
of the binomial three-letter ab
breviation system, serves as the
primary reference point of the
campus. Defined as being the

exact center of the Stanford uni
verse, the church is located in
the Inner Quadrangle. Erected in
1903 as a memorial to founder
Leland Stanford Sr., Mem Chu
was virtually destroyed in the
1906 earthquake, but was re
stored in 1913. The church
mosaics are from the Salviati
studio in Venice, while the
stained-glass windows were de
signed by Lamb of New Jersey.

2. Lomita Mall. The Physics
Lecture Hall, or "physics tank,"
is the most prominent fixture of
the science and engineering
buildings lining Lomita Mall.
Constructed in 1957, the circular
hall was financed by University
royalties on the Klystron tube, a
primary component of radar and
electron linear accelerators. It
has two lecture demonstration
theaters and several classrooms.
At the top of Lomita Mall is the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing which houses a library, a
map collection, offices and
laboratories.

3. Science buildings. This sec

tion of campus includes five
separate buildings for chemistry
and chemical engineering and
two biology buildings. Included
in the chemistry complex are the
Chemistry Building (built in
1900, of the same vintage as the
Quad), the Organic Chemistry
Laboratory (the organic profes
sor's bastion against the insati
able hordes of knowledge
hungry pre-meds), the
three Stauffer Laboratores (one
each for chemistry research,
physical chemistry and chemi
cal engineering), and the latest
addition to the family, the Seeley
G. Mudd Chemistry Building
(everyone's favorite baby).
The Herrin biology complex
consists of one building for
graduate training and research
and another which houses a lib
rary, classroom-laboratories
and an auditorium.

4. The Medical Center. The
Medical Center houses the
School of Medicine and the
Stanford Hospital. Its three
story buildings, connected by
arcades, enclose 16 acres of floor
space. Dedicated in 1959, it
houses among other things the
Lane Medical Library, the
largest collection of medical
books and documents in the
West.
The most recent addition to
the Medical Center is the Sher
man Fairchild Center which in
cludes a building for research
and a 400 seat auditorium.






The numbers on this map of the central part of campus correspond to those of the descriptions and pictures.
Across Campus Drive is the
Anatomy Building, a less-than
glamorous sprawling collection
of laboratories, classrooms and
offices.
Not part of the Medical Center
but in the vicinity is Jordan
Quad, location of the Communi
cation and Computer' Depart
ments.

5. The Stanford Museum. The
final resting place for much of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, the museum in
cludes exhibits of painting and
sculpture as well as relics of Le
land Stanford Jr.'s childhood.
The museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to
4:45 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

6. The Stadium. Stanford
Stadium, built in 1921, is still
one of the larger stadia in the
United States (capacity 89,500).
It sometimes fail to fill even for
the "Big" Cal games. A

quarter-mile track with a 220-
yard straightaway encloses the
football field.

7. The Maples-deGuerre
complex. The deGuerre Pools
and Courts provide three pools
fof recreational use, squash and
handball courts, and a 2500 seat
grandstand and were completed
in 1973. Near deGuerre is the
Roscoe Maple Pavillion, which
holds 8,500 persons for basket
ball games, other athletic con
tests and large campus events of
the rock concert variety. It was
dedicated in 1969.

Also in the vicinity is the Sun
ken Diamond for baseball, var
sity tennis courts and playing
fields for soccer, lacrosse, and
whatever sports the University's
athletes care to indulge in.

8. Encina Gym. In addition to
lockers, showers and training
facilities, the Gym has facilities
for weight-lifting, wrestling and
gymnastics, as well as a well
stocked sporting-goods store and
offices.

9. The Graduate School of
Business. The Graduate School
of Business was dedicated in
1966. Its major components, in
addition to office and study
facilities, are the Roth Center for
Advanced Management, the
Sloan Center for Management
Education, the 350 seat Bishop
Auditorium, and the Jackson
Library. The "biz school" cur
rently is considered, and con
siders itself, the best in the coun
try.

10. Memorial Auditorium
Mem Aud, as it is universally
known, was built primarily
through student contributions.
Dedicated in 1937 as a memorial
to Stanford students and facul
ties who died in World War I, it
has since become a memorial to
the dead of World War II as well.
The main auditorium seats 1760
and there is a 200 seat Little The
ater. Also located in Mem Aud
are the Drama Department and
KZSU, the student-run radio sta
tion (90.1 on the FM dial).

11. Hoover Tower. Easily the
most prominent campus erec
tion, Hoover Tower houses the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution, and Peace. Adjoining
the tower is the Lou Henry
Hoover Building, opened in
1967 to provide additional space
for the Institution's collections
and activities.

12. The Art Building and Gal
lery. The Cummings Art Build
ing houses the art and architec
ture library as well as studios
and classrooms. The 350 seat
Annenberg Auditorium is lo
cated on the lowest level. Next
door to the art building is the Art
Gallery, the location of
periodically-changing art
exhibits.

13. The Main Library. Until
last year the million book re
pository was known simply as
the Main Library; Now it is
named for Cecil H. Green, the
largest single donor to what will
soon (two years) be an exten
sively ($2O million) remodeled
and expanded edition. The orig

inal library was built in 1919 and
includes several special collec
tions (music, maps, theatre,
among others); as well as period
ical, government documents and
microtext departments. The En
gineering Library is located on
the first floor.

14. Cubberley. Known offi
cially as the School of Educa
tion, the building takes its com
mon name from the 500 seat au
ditorium located on the first
floor. The rest of the building
houses classrooms and offices.

15. UGLY. Officially named J.

fof recreational use, squash and
handball courts, and a 2500 seat
grandstand and were completed
in 1973. Near deGuerre is the
Roscoe Maple Pavillion, which
holds 8,500 persons for basket
ball games, other athletic con
tests and large campus events of
the rock concert variety. It was
dedicated in 1969.

Also in the vicinity is the Sun
ken Diamond for baseball, var
sity tennis courts and playing
fields for soccer, lacrosse, and
whatever sports the University's
athletes care to indulge in.

8. Encina Gym. In addition to
lockers, showers and training
facilities, the Gym has facilities
for weight-lifting, wrestling and
gymnastics, as well as a well
stocked sporting-goods store and
offices.

9. The Graduate School of
Business. The Graduate School
of Business was dedicated in
1966. Its major components, in
addition to office and study
facilities, are the Roth Center for
Advanced Management, the
Sloan Center for Management
Education, the 350 seat Bishop
Auditorium, and the Jackson
Library. The "biz school" cur
rently is considered, and con
siders itself, the best in the coun
try.

10. Memorial Auditorium
Mem Aud, as it is universally
known, was built primarily
through student contributions.
Dedicated in 1937 as a memorial
to Stanford students and facul
ties who died in World War I, it
has since become a memorial to
the dead of World War II as well.
The main auditorium seats 1760
and there is a 200 seat Little The
ater. Also located in Mem Aud
are the Drama Department and
KZSU, the student-run radio sta
tion (90.1 on the FM dial).

11. Hoover Tower. Easily the
most prominent campus erec
tion, Hoover Tower houses the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution, and Peace. Adjoining
the tower is the Lou Henry
Hoover Building, opened in
1967 to provide additional space
for the Institution's collections
and activities.

12. The Art Building and Gal
lery. The Cummings Art Build
ing houses the art and architec
ture library as well as studios
and classrooms. The 350 seat
Annenberg Auditorium is lo
cated on the lowest level. Next
door to the art building is the Art
Gallery, the location of
periodically-changing art
exhibits.

13. The Main Library. Until
last year the million book re
pository was known simply as
the Main Library; Now it is
named for Cecil H. Green, the
largest single donor to what will
soon (two years) be an exten
sively ($2O million) remodeled
and expanded edition. The orig

inal library was built in 1919 and
includes several special collec
tions (music, maps, theatre,
among others); as well as period
ical, government documents and
microtext departments. The En
gineering Library is located on
the first floor.

14. Cubberley. Known offi
cially as the School of Educa
tion, the building takes its com
mon name from the 500 seat au
ditorium located on the first
floor. The rest of the building
houses classrooms and offices.

15. UGLY. Officially named J.
Henry Meyer Library, the under
graduate library, by an inspired
stroke of acronymicry, has been
renamed UGLY. Featuring study
space for 1500 and windows
which do not open and can not
be washed, UGLY provides
space for classrooms, language
laboratories and stacks in addi
tions to normal library facilities.

16. SCRDT. Winner of the
Most Unpronounceable Ac
ronym on Campus Award, the

Stanford Center for Develop
ment and Research in Teaching
is one of the most advanced
facilities of its kind anywhere.
Its sophisticated audio-visual
equipment is used for research
in the psychology of learning.
LOTS (acronymic for low
overhead time sharing) compu
ter terminals are located on the
ground floor, providing a valu
able supplement to the teaching
terminals of the University's
main computer system which
are located in Pine Hall in Jordan
Quad.

17. The Law School. The Law
School Complex consists of four
separate units linked together
under the Crown Quadrangle,
named in honor of the Henry
Crown family: Crown Library
(known as the most comfortable
library at Stanford), Richmond
Hall (class and seminar rooms)
the James Irvine Gallery (faculty
and student meeting rooms and
lounges), and Kresge Au
ditorium (capacity 530).

18. The Row. The Row was
formerly comprised exclusively
of fraternity and sorority houses.
Now, though there are stiM a few
frat houses, most houses have
become coed, female, or inde
pendent. Sororities at Stanford
were banned in the 19405.

19. White Plaza. White Memo

rial Plaza is built around a 16
foot free-form fountain in the
center of the plaza ("the claw")
sculpted by Aristides Demetrios
of San Francisco.
At one end of the landscaped
Plaza is Tresidder Memorial Un
ion, dedicated in 1962 and
named for Stanford's fourth
president, Donald B. Tresidder.
The union—open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. until
midnight (10 a.m. on Saturday
and Sunday)—serves as a cam
pus community center.
Facing the Union is the 720
seat Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
dedicated in 1957, which houses
facilities for the Department of
Music and which serves as a lec
ture and performance hall.
Also on the Plaza are a number
of student service buildings: the
Old Union (offices of the Dean of
Student Affairs, Registrar, and
Admissions), the Bookstore,
Post Office (Zip Code 94305),
Career Planning and Placement
center, and Clubhouse (for stu
dent religious and other organi
zations).

20. Roble Field. Traditionally
thought of as the women's sports
complex, Roble Gymnasium,
swimming pool and tennis
courts are included in the area.
The Gym houses a basketball
court, and a dance studio as well
as lockers, showers, and offices.

21. Stop sign. Far from unique
in this area (as those with autos
will have already discovered)
this stop sign is located at a very
strategic point: it is half way
along the best short-cut between
"upper" and "lower" campus.
The "upper" entrance is located
behind Roble Gym and the
"lower" entrance is accessible
only by two improbable feeder
streets which turn off Serra
Street.

















The Campus is not wholly dis
similar to a maze. And when the
casual visitor or even semi
permanent resident finds him
self in a hurry to go somewhere,
he is frequently astonished at
how much labyrinthine charac
ter the Stanford environs can ac
quire. Areas which seemed sim
ple and easily negotiated when
described turn into bewildering
obstacle courses full of unex
pected obstructions and dead
ends.
Maps are often more hindr
ance than help. Buildings which
may look like nice simple
squares from above can appear
as anything but square from a
visitor's-eye ground view. Even
worse, the construction rate
being what it is these days, the
cartographer is hard put to keep
up with the contractor so that
Irven the latest projections are
missing two or three very large
and awkwardly placed new
buildings.
The following is a list of cam
pus landmarks which should
help alleviate the situation. In
addition to orienting the reader
through a combined schematic
and pictorial approach, it should
further expedite passage around
campus by explicitly identifying
a number of popular destina
tions as well as outlining the
reasons why they are commonly
visited.

HL Memorial Church.
'Mem Chu, one of the first victims
of the binomial three-letter ab
breviation system, serves as the
primary reference point of the
campus. Defined as being the

exact center of the Stanford uni
verse, the church is located in
the Inner Quadrangle. Erected in
1903 as a memorial to founder
Leland Stanford Sr., Mem Chu
was virtually destroyed in the
1906 earthquake, but was re
stored in 1913. The church
mosaics are from the Salviati
studio in Venice, while the
stained-glass windows were de
signed by Lamb of New Jersey.

2. Lomita Mall. The Physics
Lecture Hall, or "physics tank,"
is the most prominent fixture of
the science and engineering
buildings lining Lomita Mall.
Constructed in 1957, the circular
hall was financed by University
royalties on the Klystron tube, a
primary component of radar and
electron linear accelerators. It
has two lecture demonstration
theaters and several classrooms.
At the top of Lomita Mall is the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing which houses a library, a
map collection, offices and
laboratories.

3. Science buildings. This sec

tion of campus includes five
separate buildings for chemistry
and chemical engineering and
two biology buildings. Included
in the chemistry complex are the
Chemistry Building (built in
1900, of the same vintage as the
Quad), the Organic Chemistry
Laboratory (the organic profes
sor's bastion against the insati
able hordes of knowledge
hungry pre-meds), the
three Stauffer Laboratores (one
each for chemistry research,
physical chemistry and chemi
cal engineering), and the latest
addition to the family, the Seeley
G. Mudd Chemistry Building
(everyone's favorite baby).
The Herrin biology complex
consists of one building for
graduate training and research
and another which houses a lib
rary, classroom-laboratories
and an auditorium.

4. The Medical Center. The
Medical Center houses the
School of Medicine and the
Stanford Hospital. Its three
story buildings, connected by
arcades, enclose 16 acres of floor
space. Dedicated in 1959, it
houses among other things the
Lane Medical Library, the
largest collection of medical
books and documents in the
West.
The most recent addition to
the Medical Center is the Sher
man Fairchild Center which in
cludes a building for research
and a 400 seat auditorium.






The numbers on this map of the central part of campus correspond to those of the descriptions and pictures.
Across Campus Drive is the
Anatomy Building, a less-than
glamorous sprawling collection
of laboratories, classrooms and
offices.
Not part of the Medical Center
but in the vicinity is Jordan
Quad, location of the Communi
cation and Computer' Depart
ments.

5. The Stanford Museum. The
final resting place for much of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, the museum in
cludes exhibits of painting and
sculpture as well as relics of Le
land Stanford Jr.'s childhood.
The museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to
4:45 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

6. The Stadium. Stanford
Stadium, built in 1921, is still
one of the larger stadia in the
United States (capacity 89,500).
It sometimes fail to fill even for
the "Big" Cal games. A

quarter-mile track with a 220-
yard straightaway encloses the
football field.

7. The Maples-deGuerre
complex. The deGuerre Pools
and Courts provide three pools
fof recreational use, squash and

was virtually destroyed in the
1906 earthquake, but was re
stored in 1913. The church
mosaics are from the Salviati
studio in Venice, while the
stained-glass windows were de
signed by Lamb of New Jersey.

2. Lomita Mall. The Physics
Lecture Hall, or "physics tank,"
is the most prominent fixture of
the science and engineering
buildings lining Lomita Mall.
Constructed in 1957, the circular
hall was financed by University
royalties on the Klystron tube, a
primary component of radar and
electron linear accelerators. It
has two lecture demonstration
theaters and several classrooms.
At the top of Lomita Mall is the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing which houses a library, a
map collection, offices and
laboratories.

3. Science buildings. This sec

tion of campus includes five
separate buildings for chemistry
and chemical engineering and
two biology buildings. Included
in the chemistry complex are the
Chemistry Building (built in
1900, of the same vintage as the
Quad), the Organic Chemistry
Laboratory (the organic profes
sor's bastion against the insati
able hordes of knowledge
hungry pre-meds), the
three Stauffer Laboratores (one
each for chemistry research,
physical chemistry and chemi
cal engineering), and the latest
addition to the family, the Seeley
G. Mudd Chemistry Building
(everyone's favorite baby).
The Herrin biology complex
consists of one building for
graduate training and research
and another which houses a lib
rary, classroom-laboratories
and an auditorium.

4. The Medical Center. The
Medical Center houses the
School of Medicine and the
Stanford Hospital. Its three
story buildings, connected by
arcades, enclose 16 acres of floor
space. Dedicated in 1959, it
houses among other things the
Lane Medical Library, the
largest collection of medical
books and documents in the
West.
The most recent addition to
the Medical Center is the Sher
man Fairchild Center which in
cludes a building for research
and a 400 seat auditorium.






The numbers on this map of the central part of campus correspond to those of the descriptions and pictures.
Across Campus Drive is the
Anatomy Building, a less-than
glamorous sprawling collection
of laboratories, classrooms and
offices.
Not part of the Medical Center
but in the vicinity is Jordan
Quad, location of the Communi
cation and Computer' Depart
ments.

5. The Stanford Museum. The
final resting place for much of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, the museum in
cludes exhibits of painting and
sculpture as well as relics of Le
land Stanford Jr.'s childhood.
The museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to
4:45 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

6. The Stadium. Stanford
Stadium, built in 1921, is still
one of the larger stadia in the
United States (capacity 89,500).
It sometimes fail to fill even for
the "Big" Cal games. A

quarter-mile track with a 220-
yard straightaway encloses the
football field.

7. The Maples-deGuerre
complex. The deGuerre Pools
and Courts provide three pools
fof recreational use, squash and
handball courts, and a 2500 seat
grandstand and were completed
in 1973. Near deGuerre is the
Roscoe Maple Pavillion, which
holds 8,500 persons for basket
ball games, other athletic con
tests and large campus events of
the rock concert variety. It was
dedicated in 1969.

Also in the vicinity is the Sun
ken Diamond for baseball, var
sity tennis courts and playing
fields for soccer, lacrosse, and
whatever sports the University's
athletes care to indulge in.

8. Encina Gym. In addition to
lockers, showers and training
facilities, the Gym has facilities
for weight-lifting, wrestling and
gymnastics, as well as a well
stocked sporting-goods store and
offices.

9. The Graduate School of
Business. The Graduate School
of Business was dedicated in
1966. Its major components, in
addition to office and study
facilities, are the Roth Center for
Advanced Management, the
Sloan Center for Management
Education, the 350 seat Bishop
Auditorium, and the Jackson
Library. The "biz school" cur
rently is considered, and con
siders itself, the best in the coun
try.

10. Memorial Auditorium
Mem Aud, as it is universally
known, was built primarily
through student contributions.
Dedicated in 1937 as a memorial
to Stanford students and facul
ties who died in World War I, it
has since become a memorial to
the dead of World War II as well.
The main auditorium seats 1760
and there is a 200 seat Little The
ater. Also located in Mem Aud
are the Drama Department and
KZSU, the student-run radio sta
tion (90.1 on the FM dial).

11. Hoover Tower. Easily the
most prominent campus erec
tion, Hoover Tower houses the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution, and Peace. Adjoining
the tower is the Lou Henry
Hoover Building, opened in
1967 to provide additional space
for the Institution's collections
and activities.

12. The Art Building and Gal
lery. The Cummings Art Build
ing houses the art and architec
ture library as well as studios
and classrooms. The 350 seat
Annenberg Auditorium is lo
cated on the lowest level. Next
door to the art building is the Art
Gallery, the location of
periodically-changing art
exhibits.

13. The Main Library. Until
last year the million book re
pository was known simply as
the Main Library; Now it is
named for Cecil H. Green, the
largest single donor to what will
soon (two years) be an exten
sively ($2O million) remodeled
and expanded edition. The orig

inal library was built in 1919 and
includes several special collec
tions (music, maps, theatre,
among others); as well as period
ical, government documents and
microtext departments. The En
gineering Library is located on
the first floor.

14. Cubberley. Known offi
cially as the School of Educa
tion, the building takes its com
mon name from the 500 seat au
ditorium located on the first
floor. The rest of the building
houses classrooms and offices.

15. UGLY. Officially named J.
Henry Meyer Library, the under
graduate library, by an inspired
stroke of acronymicry, has been
renamed UGLY. Featuring study
space for 1500 and windows
which do not open and can not
be washed, UGLY provides
space for classrooms, language
laboratories and stacks in addi
tions to normal library facilities.

16. SCRDT. Winner of the
Most Unpronounceable Ac
ronym on Campus Award, the

Stanford Center for Develop
ment and Research in Teaching
is one of the most advanced
facilities of its kind anywhere.
Its sophisticated audio-visual
equipment is used for research
in the psychology of learning.
LOTS (acronymic for low
overhead time sharing) compu
ter terminals are located on the
ground floor, providing a valu
able supplement to the teaching
terminals of the University's
main computer system which
are located in Pine Hall in Jordan
Quad.

17. The Law School. The Law
School Complex consists of four
separate units linked together
under the Crown Quadrangle,
named in honor of the Henry
Crown family: Crown Library
(known as the most comfortable
library at Stanford), Richmond
Hall (class and seminar rooms)
the James Irvine Gallery (faculty
and student meeting rooms and
lounges), and Kresge Au
ditorium (capacity 530).

18. The Row. The Row was
formerly comprised exclusively
of fraternity and sorority houses.
Now, though there are stiM a few
frat houses, most houses have
become coed, female, or inde
pendent. Sororities at Stanford
were banned in the 19405.

19. White Plaza. White Memo

rial Plaza is built around a 16
foot free-form fountain in the
center of the plaza ("the claw")
sculpted by Aristides Demetrios
of San Francisco.
At one end of the landscaped
Plaza is Tresidder Memorial Un
ion, dedicated in 1962 and
named for Stanford's fourth
president, Donald B. Tresidder.
The union—open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. until
midnight (10 a.m. on Saturday
and Sunday)—serves as a cam
pus community center.
Facing the Union is the 720
seat Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
dedicated in 1957, which houses
facilities for the Department of
Music and which serves as a lec
ture and performance hall.
Also on the Plaza are a number
of student service buildings: the
Old Union (offices of the Dean of
Student Affairs, Registrar, and
Admissions), the Bookstore,
Post Office (Zip Code 94305),
Career Planning and Placement
center, and Clubhouse (for stu
dent religious and other organi
zations).

20. Roble Field. Traditionally
thought of as the women's sports
complex, Roble Gymnasium,
swimming pool and tennis
courts are included in the area.
The Gym houses a basketball
court, and a dance studio as well
as lockers, showers, and offices.

21. Stop sign. Far from unique
in this area (as those with autos
will have already discovered)
this stop sign is located at a very
strategic point: it is half way
along the best short-cut between
"upper" and "lower" campus.
The "upper" entrance is located
behind Roble Gym and the
"lower" entrance is accessible
only by two improbable feeder
streets which turn off Serra
Street.

















The Campus is not wholly dis
similar to a maze. And when the
casual visitor or even semi
permanent resident finds him
self in a hurry to go somewhere,
he is frequently astonished at
how much labyrinthine charac
ter the Stanford environs can ac
quire. Areas which seemed sim
ple and easily negotiated when
described turn into bewildering
obstacle courses full of unex
pected obstructions and dead
ends.
Maps are often more hindr
ance than help. Buildings which
may look like nice simple
squares from above can appear
as anything but square from a
visitor's-eye ground view. Even
worse, the construction rate
being what it is these days, the
cartographer is hard put to keep
up with the contractor so that
Irven the latest projections are
missing two or three very large
and awkwardly placed new
buildings.
The following is a list of cam
pus landmarks which should
help alleviate the situation. In
addition to orienting the reader
through a combined schematic
and pictorial approach, it should
further expedite passage around
campus by explicitly identifying
a number of popular destina
tions as well as outlining the
reasons why they are commonly
visited.

HL Memorial Church.
'Mem Chu, one of the first victims
of the binomial three-letter ab
breviation system, serves as the
primary reference point of the
campus. Defined as being the

exact center of the Stanford uni
verse, the church is located in
the Inner Quadrangle. Erected in
1903 as a memorial to founder
Leland Stanford Sr., Mem Chu
was virtually destroyed in the
1906 earthquake, but was re
stored in 1913. The church
mosaics are from the Salviati

19. White Plaza. White Memo

rial Plaza is built around a 16
foot free-form fountain in the
center of the plaza ("the claw")
sculpted by Aristides Demetrios
of San Francisco.
At one end of the landscaped
Plaza is Tresidder Memorial Un
ion, dedicated in 1962 and
named for Stanford's fourth
president, Donald B. Tresidder.
The union—open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. until
midnight (10 a.m. on Saturday
and Sunday)—serves as a cam
pus community center.
Facing the Union is the 720
seat Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
dedicated in 1957, which houses
facilities for the Department of
Music and which serves as a lec
ture and performance hall.
Also on the Plaza are a number
of student service buildings: the
Old Union (offices of the Dean of
Student Affairs, Registrar, and
Admissions), the Bookstore,
Post Office (Zip Code 94305),
Career Planning and Placement
center, and Clubhouse (for stu
dent religious and other organi
zations).

20. Roble Field. Traditionally
thought of as the women's sports
complex, Roble Gymnasium,
swimming pool and tennis
courts are included in the area.
The Gym houses a basketball
court, and a dance studio as well
as lockers, showers, and offices.

21. Stop sign. Far from unique
in this area (as those with autos
will have already discovered)
this stop sign is located at a very
strategic point: it is half way
along the best short-cut between
"upper" and "lower" campus.
The "upper" entrance is located
behind Roble Gym and the
"lower" entrance is accessible
only by two improbable feeder
streets which turn off Serra
Street.

















The Campus is not wholly dis
similar to a maze. And when the
casual visitor or even semi
permanent resident finds him
self in a hurry to go somewhere,
he is frequently astonished at
how much labyrinthine charac
ter the Stanford environs can ac
quire. Areas which seemed sim
ple and easily negotiated when
described turn into bewildering
obstacle courses full of unex
pected obstructions and dead
ends.
Maps are often more hindr
ance than help. Buildings which
may look like nice simple
squares from above can appear
as anything but square from a
visitor's-eye ground view. Even
worse, the construction rate
being what it is these days, the
cartographer is hard put to keep
up with the contractor so that
Irven the latest projections are
missing two or three very large
and awkwardly placed new
buildings.
The following is a list of cam
pus landmarks which should
help alleviate the situation. In
addition to orienting the reader
through a combined schematic
and pictorial approach, it should
further expedite passage around
campus by explicitly identifying
a number of popular destina
tions as well as outlining the
reasons why they are commonly
visited.

HL Memorial Church.
'Mem Chu, one of the first victims
of the binomial three-letter ab
breviation system, serves as the
primary reference point of the
campus. Defined as being the

exact center of the Stanford uni
verse, the church is located in
the Inner Quadrangle. Erected in
1903 as a memorial to founder
Leland Stanford Sr., Mem Chu
was virtually destroyed in the
1906 earthquake, but was re
stored in 1913. The church
mosaics are from the Salviati
studio in Venice, while the
stained-glass windows were de
signed by Lamb of New Jersey.

2. Lomita Mall. The Physics
Lecture Hall, or "physics tank,"
is the most prominent fixture of
the science and engineering
buildings lining Lomita Mall.
Constructed in 1957, the circular
hall was financed by University
royalties on the Klystron tube, a
primary component of radar and
electron linear accelerators. It
has two lecture demonstration
theaters and several classrooms.
At the top of Lomita Mall is the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing which houses a library, a
map collection, offices and
laboratories.

3. Science buildings. This sec

tion of campus includes five
separate buildings for chemistry
and chemical engineering and
two biology buildings. Included
in the chemistry complex are the
Chemistry Building (built in
1900, of the same vintage as the
Quad), the Organic Chemistry
Laboratory (the organic profes
sor's bastion against the insati
able hordes of knowledge
hungry pre-meds), the
three Stauffer Laboratores (one
each for chemistry research,
physical chemistry and chemi
cal engineering), and the latest
addition to the family, the Seeley
G. Mudd Chemistry Building
(everyone's favorite baby).
The Herrin biology complex
consists of one building for
graduate training and research
and another which houses a lib
rary, classroom-laboratories
and an auditorium.

4. The Medical Center. The
Medical Center houses the
School of Medicine and the
Stanford Hospital. Its three
story buildings, connected by
arcades, enclose 16 acres of floor
space. Dedicated in 1959, it
houses among other things the
Lane Medical Library, the
largest collection of medical
books and documents in the
West.
The most recent addition to
the Medical Center is the Sher
man Fairchild Center which in
cludes a building for research
and a 400 seat auditorium.






The numbers on this map of the central part of campus correspond to those of the descriptions and pictures.
Across Campus Drive is the
Anatomy Building, a less-than
glamorous sprawling collection
of laboratories, classrooms and
offices.
Not part of the Medical Center
but in the vicinity is Jordan
Quad, location of the Communi
cation and Computer' Depart
ments.

5. The Stanford Museum. The
final resting place for much of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, the museum in
cludes exhibits of painting and
sculpture as well as relics of Le
land Stanford Jr.'s childhood.
The museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to
4:45 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

6. The Stadium. Stanford
Stadium, built in 1921, is still
one of the larger stadia in the
United States (capacity 89,500).
It sometimes fail to fill even for
the "Big" Cal games. A

quarter-mile track with a 220-
yard straightaway encloses the
football field.

7. The Maples-deGuerre
complex. The deGuerre Pools
and Courts provide three pools
fof recreational use, squash and
handball courts, and a 2500 seat
grandstand and were completed
in 1973. Near deGuerre is the
Roscoe Maple Pavillion, which
holds 8,500 persons for basket
ball games, other athletic con
tests and large campus events of
the rock concert variety. It was
dedicated in 1969.

Also in the vicinity is the Sun
ken Diamond for baseball, var
sity tennis courts and playing
fields for soccer, lacrosse, and
whatever sports the University's
athletes care to indulge in.

8. Encina Gym. In addition to
lockers, showers and training
facilities, the Gym has facilities
for weight-lifting, wrestling and
gymnastics, as well as a well
stocked sporting-goods store and
offices.

9. The Graduate School of
Business. The Graduate School
of Business was dedicated in
1966. Its major components, in
addition to office and study
facilities, are the Roth Center for
Advanced Management, the
Sloan Center for Management
Education, the 350 seat Bishop
Auditorium, and the Jackson
Library. The "biz school" cur
rently is considered, and con
siders itself, the best in the coun
try.

10. Memorial Auditorium
Mem Aud, as it is universally
known, was built primarily
through student contributions.
Dedicated in 1937 as a memorial
to Stanford students and facul
ties who died in World War I, it
has since become a memorial to
the dead of World War II as well.
The main auditorium seats 1760
and there is a 200 seat Little The
ater. Also located in Mem Aud
are the Drama Department and
KZSU, the student-run radio sta
tion (90.1 on the FM dial).

11. Hoover Tower. Easily the
most prominent campus erec
tion, Hoover Tower houses the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution, and Peace. Adjoining
the tower is the Lou Henry
Hoover Building, opened in
1967 to provide additional space
for the Institution's collections
and activities.

12. The Art Building and Gal
lery. The Cummings Art Build
ing houses the art and architec
ture library as well as studios
and classrooms. The 350 seat
Annenberg Auditorium is lo
cated on the lowest level. Next
door to the art building is the Art
Gallery, the location of
periodically-changing art
exhibits.

13. The Main Library. Until
last year the million book re
pository was known simply as
the Main Library; Now it is
named for Cecil H. Green, the
largest single donor to what will
soon (two years) be an exten
sively ($2O million) remodeled
and expanded edition. The orig

inal library was built in 1919 and
includes several special collec
tions (music, maps, theatre,
among others); as well as period
ical, government documents and
microtext departments. The En
gineering Library is located on
the first floor.

14. Cubberley. Known offi
cially as the School of Educa
tion, the building takes its com
mon name from the 500 seat au
ditorium located on the first
floor. The rest of the building
houses classrooms and offices.

15. UGLY. Officially named J.
Henry Meyer Library, the under
graduate library, by an inspired
stroke of acronymicry, has been
renamed UGLY. Featuring study
space for 1500 and windows
which do not open and can not
be washed, UGLY provides
space for classrooms, language
laboratories and stacks in addi
tions to normal library facilities.

16. SCRDT. Winner of the
Most Unpronounceable Ac
ronym on Campus Award, the

Stanford Center for Develop
ment and Research in Teaching
is one of the most advanced
facilities of its kind anywhere.
Its sophisticated audio-visual
equipment is used for research
in the psychology of learning.
LOTS (acronymic for low
overhead time sharing) compu
ter terminals are located on the
ground floor, providing a valu
able supplement to the teaching
terminals of the University's
main computer system which
are located in Pine Hall in Jordan
Quad.

17. The Law School. The Law
School Complex consists of four
separate units linked together
under the Crown Quadrangle,
named in honor of the Henry
Crown family: Crown Library
(known as the most comfortable
library at Stanford), Richmond
Hall (class and seminar rooms)
the James Irvine Gallery (faculty
and student meeting rooms and
lounges), and Kresge Au
ditorium (capacity 530).

18. The Row. The Row was
formerly comprised exclusively
of fraternity and sorority houses.
Now, though there are stiM a few
frat houses, most houses have
become coed, female, or inde
pendent. Sororities at Stanford
were banned in the 19405.
