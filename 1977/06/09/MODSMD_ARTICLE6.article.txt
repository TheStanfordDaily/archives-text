# Fun in the backyard
## A 						breath-taking trip over the mountains for a day at the beach 
### 
It may be hard to believe, but there is more to the campus than
buildings, sidewalks and landscaped greenery. Just a few
hundred yards west of the architectural jumble, the golden
(drought-stricken) hills of the Peninsula rise in deserted splen
dor. It is possible to walk for miles through these rolling mounds
without meeting anything more garrulous than a cow and
never leave the University proper.
Even better, however, is what lies just beyond Stanford prop
erty: the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. The
routes through the forested folds of the former afford the in
trepid motorist (who is not fazed by a double reverse hairpin
turn) a memorable driving experience and a circuitous trip to
the beach.
There are two main arteries to the top of the peaks and beauti
ful Skyline Boulevard: Page Mill Road (which runs just south
of campus, perpindicular to El Camino Real and Foothill Ex
pressway) and Sandhill Road to Portola Road (a right) to La
Honda Road (a sharp left).
Once on top, head north until you hit Route 84 at Sky Londa.
Make the turn to La Honda and then either continue on 84 to San
Gregorio and the coast or take Pescadero Road (a left off 84) to
Pescadero. Both choices have a great deal to commend them but
best of all is arriving at the ocean itself. The stretch of Route 1
between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz may not be as breath
taking as Big Sur, but it comes awfully close in places. Magnifi
cent views are numerous and beaches abound.
Even at a leisurely pace,the trip takes roughly an hour, so that a
rewarding visit to the Great Blue Expanse need take no more
than half a day.
