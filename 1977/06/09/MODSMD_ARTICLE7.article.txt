# Up in the air with Hoover Tower...

Everyone knows that once you
have become an alumnus, the in
stitution which graduated you
immediately starts to solicit
funds from you and does not
stop until you do. Under this
kind of constant duress,
everyone eventually gives a little
something. Some even volunteer
money—perhaps as a tax dodge.
Herbert Hoover was a rare excep
tion.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas
such as founding the Food Re
search Institute and encouraging
the development of a business
school.
Probably his greatest contribu
tion to Stanford was the creation
of one of the world's most com
plete collections of information
on 20th century wars and revolu
tion.
The Hoover institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is a
major center for advanced scho
larship in political science, his
tory, economics and interna
tional law.

As student guides in the tower
point out to visitors, the institu
tion has the third largest arc
hives in the nation the largest
private archives.
It contains over 1,250,000 vol
umes, including government
documents, as well as 3000 arc
hive units, which are private
collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries and
other documents. Subscriptions
to newspapers and periodicials
have resulted in more than
30,000 titles being on file.
Investigative opportunities
What all these numbers sig
nify to a scholar is the possibility
to thoroughly investigate a sub
ject whether it be an intensive
study of a particular country,
war, or revolution, or a broad,
comparative look at a political or
historical phenomenon. The in
stitution has published 275 vol
umes since 1919 when Hoover
founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties," "The North Ko
rean Economy," "Truman, the

Jewish Vote, and the Creation of
Israel," "Yearbook on Interna
tional Communist Affairs: 1973
(seventh in a series)," and "A
Chinese-English Dictionary of
Communist Chinese Terminol
ogy."
As American Relief Administ
ration Director in Europe during
World War I, Hoover began his
collection with the help of Stan
ford professors Ephraim Adams
and Ralph Lutz. He hoped that
the materials they gathered
would provide the data, with
which future historians could
work. Lutz became the institu

tion's director in 1925.
Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in various
places on campus many in the
main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the mas
ses of documents the collecting
team sent back at the end of the
year.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, the founders
set about raising money. By
1939, they were ready to start the
tower, which was dedicated in
1941.

storage space, the institution
was freed for further acquisition
and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated
in 1967 and houses the East
Asian and newspaper collec
tions and also 36 research of
fices.
A third building is currently
under construction.
285-foot tower
The 285-foot tower holds the
library and main archives
there are 17 levels of stacks as
well as administrative and re

search offices, two reading
rooms, two display rooms of
Hoover memorabilia and a 35-
bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium
for the 1939-40 World's Fair and
were later donated to Hoover by
the Belgian American Educa
tional Foundation. Hoover gave
them to the institution, which
placed them on top of the tower.
Hoover staffers are constantly
seeking new items for all their
collections. Although the in
stitution began as a vehicle to
study World War I, Hoover's

statement of purpose that it
"promote peace" throughout the
world led to its expansion and
constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese col
lections are especially large.
Hoover particularly encouraged
three areas of interest which are
still pursued today: domestic

problems, international studies
and scholarly fellowships.
The library is dividied into re
gional and special collections:
Africa, East Asia, Eastern
Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British
Labor Collection, the
Nicolaevsky Collection and the

New Left Collection.
That same call for the promo
tion of peace has led to the in
stitution's striving to serve as a
dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest sol
utions and uncover trends in the
world through its research and
publications.
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and ar
chivists, the institution makes
its holdings available to Stan
ford students and faculty and all
other scholars. Many authors
and researchers come from all
over the world to use the institu
tion.
Recently a fellows program
has been established in three
areas: public affairs, peace and
national affairs.
The fellowships are given to
selected applicants and allow
them to spend time "in unre
stricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to
use the institution's resources.
They may discuss their projects
with any of the scholars con
nected with the institution.
Peace fellows
The projects of the three peace
fellows must investigate "the
phenomena of peace," the fel

lowship founders decreed. Pub
lic affairs fellowships are de
signed to train some three
people a year to work for legis
lators and national adminis
trators.
The staff and administration
of the institution cover a wide
spectrum. The director, W.
Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of
California board of regents. The
staff, which represents 20 diffe
rent countries and 30 languages,
numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy
and helps in the selection of a
director, consists of corporate
businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated money
The institution was blessed
from the very beginning with
more money than a comparable
public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to
provide funds, and in 1922 he
gave $200,000 through the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.

Endowments and reserve
funds are now over $12,000,000.
Gifts to the institution have risen
to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, alumnus David Packard
(co-founder of Hewlett-Packard)
gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now consi
dered an independent body
within the Univeristy, not just its
stepchild in the backroom. The
dozens of visitors who enter
its glass doors every day see only
a small part of the many facets of
the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mys
teriously in the middle floors of
the building, are open only to the
eyes of the librarians and ar
chivists. Even library patrons are
not free to browse they must
request specific books, then wait
for the search crew to bring
them.
Visitors in the elevator may
get a glimpse of the director's of
fice, on the same floor where
Hoover himself once kept an of
fice. But the wealth of materials
in the archives hold a secret no
one can ever learn completely.

stitution which graduated you
immediately starts to solicit
funds from you and does not
stop until you do. Under this
kind of constant duress,
everyone eventually gives a little
something. Some even volunteer
money—perhaps as a tax dodge.
Herbert Hoover was a rare excep
tion.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas
such as founding the Food Re
search Institute and encouraging
the development of a business
school.
Probably his greatest contribu
tion to Stanford was the creation
of one of the world's most com
plete collections of information
on 20th century wars and revolu
tion.
The Hoover institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is a
major center for advanced scho
larship in political science, his
tory, economics and interna
tional law.

As student guides in the tower
point out to visitors, the institu
tion has the third largest arc
hives in the nation the largest
private archives.
It contains over 1,250,000 vol
umes, including government
documents, as well as 3000 arc
hive units, which are private
collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries and
other documents. Subscriptions
to newspapers and periodicials
have resulted in more than
30,000 titles being on file.
Investigative opportunities
What all these numbers sig
nify to a scholar is the possibility
to thoroughly investigate a sub
ject whether it be an intensive
study of a particular country,
war, or revolution, or a broad,
comparative look at a political or
historical phenomenon. The in
stitution has published 275 vol
umes since 1919 when Hoover
founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties," "The North Ko
rean Economy," "Truman, the

Jewish Vote, and the Creation of
Israel," "Yearbook on Interna
tional Communist Affairs: 1973
(seventh in a series)," and "A
Chinese-English Dictionary of
Communist Chinese Terminol
ogy."
As American Relief Administ
ration Director in Europe during
World War I, Hoover began his
collection with the help of Stan
ford professors Ephraim Adams
and Ralph Lutz. He hoped that
the materials they gathered
would provide the data, with
which future historians could
work. Lutz became the institu

tion's director in 1925.
Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in various
places on campus many in the
main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the mas
ses of documents the collecting
team sent back at the end of the
year.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, the founders
set about raising money. By
1939, they were ready to start the
tower, which was dedicated in
1941.

was freed for further acquisition
and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated
in 1967 and houses the East
Asian and newspaper collec
tions and also 36 research of
fices.
A third building is currently
under construction.
285-foot tower
The 285-foot tower holds the
library and main archives
there are 17 levels of stacks as
well as administrative and re

search offices, two reading
rooms, two display rooms of
Hoover memorabilia and a 35-
bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium
for the 1939-40 World's Fair and
were later donated to Hoover by
the Belgian American Educa
tional Foundation. Hoover gave
them to the institution, which
placed them on top of the tower.
Hoover staffers are constantly
seeking new items for all their
collections. Although the in
stitution began as a vehicle to
study World War I, Hoover's

statement of purpose that it
"promote peace" throughout the
world led to its expansion and
constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese col
lections are especially large.
Hoover particularly encouraged
three areas of interest which are
still pursued today: domestic

problems, international studies
and scholarly fellowships.
The library is dividied into re
gional and special collections:
Africa, East Asia, Eastern
Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British
Labor Collection, the
Nicolaevsky Collection and the

New Left Collection.
That same call for the promo
tion of peace has led to the in
stitution's striving to serve as a
dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest sol
utions and uncover trends in the
world through its research and
publications.
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and ar
chivists, the institution makes
its holdings available to Stan
ford students and faculty and all
other scholars. Many authors
and researchers come from all
over the world to use the institu
tion.
Recently a fellows program
has been established in three
areas: public affairs, peace and
national affairs.
The fellowships are given to
selected applicants and allow
them to spend time "in unre
stricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to
use the institution's resources.
They may discuss their projects
with any of the scholars con
nected with the institution.
Peace fellows
The projects of the three peace
fellows must investigate "the
phenomena of peace," the fel

lowship founders decreed. Pub
lic affairs fellowships are de
signed to train some three
people a year to work for legis
lators and national adminis
trators.
The staff and administration
of the institution cover a wide
spectrum. The director, W.
Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of
California board of regents. The
staff, which represents 20 diffe
rent countries and 30 languages,
numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy
and helps in the selection of a
director, consists of corporate
businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated money
The institution was blessed
from the very beginning with
more money than a comparable
public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to
provide funds, and in 1922 he
gave $200,000 through the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.

Endowments and reserve
funds are now over $12,000,000.
Gifts to the institution have risen
to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, alumnus David Packard
(co-founder of Hewlett-Packard)
gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now consi
dered an independent body
within the Univeristy, not just its
stepchild in the backroom. The
dozens of visitors who enter
its glass doors every day see only
a small part of the many facets of
the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mys
teriously in the middle floors of
the building, are open only to the
eyes of the librarians and ar
chivists. Even library patrons are
not free to browse they must
request specific books, then wait
for the search crew to bring
them.
Visitors in the elevator may
get a glimpse of the director's of
fice, on the same floor where
Hoover himself once kept an of
fice. But the wealth of materials
in the archives hold a secret no
one can ever learn completely.

Herbert Hoover was a rare excep
tion.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas
such as founding the Food Re
search Institute and encouraging
the development of a business
school.
Probably his greatest contribu
tion to Stanford was the creation
of one of the world's most com
plete collections of information
on 20th century wars and revolu
tion.
The Hoover institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is a
major center for advanced scho
larship in political science, his
tory, economics and interna
tional law.

As student guides in the tower
point out to visitors, the institu
tion has the third largest arc
hives in the nation the largest
private archives.
It contains over 1,250,000 vol
umes, including government
documents, as well as 3000 arc
hive units, which are private
collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries and
other documents. Subscriptions
to newspapers and periodicials
have resulted in more than
30,000 titles being on file.
Investigative opportunities
What all these numbers sig
nify to a scholar is the possibility
to thoroughly investigate a sub
ject whether it be an intensive
study of a particular country,
war, or revolution, or a broad,
comparative look at a political or
historical phenomenon. The in
stitution has published 275 vol
umes since 1919 when Hoover
founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties," "The North Ko
rean Economy," "Truman, the

Jewish Vote, and the Creation of
Israel," "Yearbook on Interna
tional Communist Affairs: 1973
(seventh in a series)," and "A
Chinese-English Dictionary of
Communist Chinese Terminol
ogy."
As American Relief Administ
ration Director in Europe during
World War I, Hoover began his
collection with the help of Stan
ford professors Ephraim Adams
and Ralph Lutz. He hoped that
the materials they gathered
would provide the data, with
which future historians could
work. Lutz became the institu

tion's director in 1925.
Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in various
places on campus many in the
main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the mas
ses of documents the collecting
team sent back at the end of the
year.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, the founders
set about raising money. By
1939, they were ready to start the
tower, which was dedicated in
1941.

was freed for further acquisition
and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated
in 1967 and houses the East
Asian and newspaper collec

fices.
A third building is currently
under construction.
285-foot tower
The 285-foot tower holds the
library and main archives
there are 17 levels of stacks as
well as administrative and re

search offices, two reading
rooms, two display rooms of
Hoover memorabilia and a 35-
bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium
for the 1939-40 World's Fair and
were later donated to Hoover by
the Belgian American Educa
tional Foundation. Hoover gave
them to the institution, which
placed them on top of the tower.
Hoover staffers are constantly
seeking new items for all their
collections. Although the in
stitution began as a vehicle to
study World War I, Hoover's

statement of purpose that it
"promote peace" throughout the
world led to its expansion and
constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese col
lections are especially large.
Hoover particularly encouraged
three areas of interest which are
still pursued today: domestic

problems, international studies
and scholarly fellowships.
The library is dividied into re
gional and special collections:
Africa, East Asia, Eastern
Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British
Labor Collection, the
Nicolaevsky Collection and the

New Left Collection.
That same call for the promo
tion of peace has led to the in
stitution's striving to serve as a
dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest sol
utions and uncover trends in the
world through its research and
publications.
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and ar
chivists, the institution makes
its holdings available to Stan
ford students and faculty and all
other scholars. Many authors
and researchers come from all
over the world to use the institu
tion.
Recently a fellows program
has been established in three
areas: public affairs, peace and
national affairs.
The fellowships are given to
selected applicants and allow
them to spend time "in unre
stricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to
use the institution's resources.
They may discuss their projects
with any of the scholars con
nected with the institution.
Peace fellows
The projects of the three peace
fellows must investigate "the
phenomena of peace," the fel

lowship founders decreed. Pub
lic affairs fellowships are de
signed to train some three
people a year to work for legis
lators and national adminis
trators.
The staff and administration
of the institution cover a wide
spectrum. The director, W.
Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of
California board of regents. The
staff, which represents 20 diffe
rent countries and 30 languages,
numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy
and helps in the selection of a
director, consists of corporate
businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated money
The institution was blessed
from the very beginning with
more money than a comparable
public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to
provide funds, and in 1922 he
gave $200,000 through the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.

Endowments and reserve
funds are now over $12,000,000.
Gifts to the institution have risen
to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, alumnus David Packard
(co-founder of Hewlett-Packard)
gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now consi
dered an independent body
within the Univeristy, not just its
stepchild in the backroom. The
dozens of visitors who enter
its glass doors every day see only
a small part of the many facets of
the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mys
teriously in the middle floors of
the building, are open only to the
eyes of the librarians and ar
chivists. Even library patrons are
not free to browse they must
request specific books, then wait
for the search crew to bring
them.
Visitors in the elevator may
get a glimpse of the director's of
fice, on the same floor where
Hoover himself once kept an of
fice. But the wealth of materials
in the archives hold a secret no
one can ever learn completely.

something. Some even volunteer
money—perhaps as a tax dodge.
Herbert Hoover was a rare excep
tion.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas
such as founding the Food Re
search Institute and encouraging
the development of a business
school.
Probably his greatest contribu
tion to Stanford was the creation
of one of the world's most com
plete collections of information
on 20th century wars and revolu
tion.
The Hoover institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is a
major center for advanced scho
larship in political science, his
tory, economics and interna
tional law.

As student guides in the tower
point out to visitors, the institu
tion has the third largest arc
hives in the nation the largest
private archives.
It contains over 1,250,000 vol
umes, including government
documents, as well as 3000 arc
hive units, which are private
collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries and
other documents. Subscriptions
to newspapers and periodicials
have resulted in more than
30,000 titles being on file.
Investigative opportunities
What all these numbers sig
nify to a scholar is the possibility
to thoroughly investigate a sub
ject whether it be an intensive
study of a particular country,
war, or revolution, or a broad,
comparative look at a political or
historical phenomenon. The in
stitution has published 275 vol
umes since 1919 when Hoover
founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties," "The North Ko
rean Economy," "Truman, the

Jewish Vote, and the Creation of
Israel," "Yearbook on Interna
tional Communist Affairs: 1973
(seventh in a series)," and "A
Chinese-English Dictionary of
Communist Chinese Terminol
ogy."
As American Relief Administ
ration Director in Europe during
World War I, Hoover began his
collection with the help of Stan
ford professors Ephraim Adams
and Ralph Lutz. He hoped that
the materials they gathered
would provide the data, with
which future historians could
work. Lutz became the institu

tion's director in 1925.
Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in various
places on campus many in the
main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the mas
ses of documents the collecting
team sent back at the end of the
year.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, the founders
set about raising money. By
1939, they were ready to start the
tower, which was dedicated in
1941.
With a permanent base and

storage space, the institution
was freed for further acquisition
and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated
in 1967 and houses the East
Asian and newspaper collec
tions and also 36 research of
fices.
A third building is currently
under construction.
285-foot tower
The 285-foot tower holds the
library and main archives
there are 17 levels of stacks as
well as administrative and re

search offices, two reading
rooms, two display rooms of
Hoover memorabilia and a 35-
bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium
for the 1939-40 World's Fair and
were later donated to Hoover by
the Belgian American Educa
tional Foundation. Hoover gave
them to the institution, which
placed them on top of the tower.
Hoover staffers are constantly
seeking new items for all their
collections. Although the in
stitution began as a vehicle to
study World War I, Hoover's

statement of purpose that it
"promote peace" throughout the
world led to its expansion and
constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese col
lections are especially large.
Hoover particularly encouraged
three areas of interest which are
still pursued today: domestic

problems, international studies
and scholarly fellowships.
The library is dividied into re
gional and special collections:
Africa, East Asia, Eastern
Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British
Labor Collection, the
Nicolaevsky Collection and the

New Left Collection.
That same call for the promo
tion of peace has led to the in
stitution's striving to serve as a
dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest sol
utions and uncover trends in the
world through its research and
publications.
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and ar
chivists, the institution makes
its holdings available to Stan
ford students and faculty and all
other scholars. Many authors
and researchers come from all
over the world to use the institu
tion.
Recently a fellows program
has been established in three
areas: public affairs, peace and
national affairs.
The fellowships are given to
selected applicants and allow
them to spend time "in unre
stricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to
use the institution's resources.
They may discuss their projects
with any of the scholars con
nected with the institution.
Peace fellows
The projects of the three peace
fellows must investigate "the
phenomena of peace," the fel

lowship founders decreed. Pub
lic affairs fellowships are de
signed to train some three
people a year to work for legis
lators and national adminis
trators.
The staff and administration
of the institution cover a wide
spectrum. The director, W.
Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of
California board of regents. The
staff, which represents 20 diffe
rent countries and 30 languages,
numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy
and helps in the selection of a
director, consists of corporate
businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated money
The institution was blessed
from the very beginning with
more money than a comparable
public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to
provide funds, and in 1922 he
gave $200,000 through the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.

Endowments and reserve
funds are now over $12,000,000.
Gifts to the institution have risen
to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, alumnus David Packard
(co-founder of Hewlett-Packard)
gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now consi
dered an independent body
within the Univeristy, not just its
stepchild in the backroom. The
dozens of visitors who enter
its glass doors every day see only
a small part of the many facets of
the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mys
teriously in the middle floors of
the building, are open only to the
eyes of the librarians and ar
chivists. Even library patrons are
not free to browse they must
request specific books, then wait
for the search crew to bring
them.
Visitors in the elevator may
get a glimpse of the director's of
fice, on the same floor where
Hoover himself once kept an of
fice. But the wealth of materials
in the archives hold a secret no
one can ever learn completely.
