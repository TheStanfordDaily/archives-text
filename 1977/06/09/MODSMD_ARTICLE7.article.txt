# Up in the air with Hoover Tower...

Everyone knows that once you
have become an alumnus, the in
stitution which graduated you
immediately starts to solicit
funds from you and does not
stop until you do. Under this
kind of constant duress,
everyone eventually gives a little
something. Some even volunteer
moneyâ€”perhaps as a tax dodge.
Herbert Hoover was a rare excep
tion.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas
such as founding the Food Re
search Institute and encouraging
the development of a business
school.
Probably his greatest contribu
tion to Stanford was the creation
of one of the world's most com
plete collections of information
on 20th century wars and revolu
tion.
The Hoover institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is a
major center for advanced scho
larship in political science, his
tory, economics and interna
tional law.

As student guides in the tower
point out to visitors, the institu
tion has the third largest arc
hives in the nation the largest
private archives.
It contains over 1,250,000 vol
umes, including government
documents, as well as 3000 arc
hive units, which are private
collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries and
other documents. Subscriptions
to newspapers and periodicials
have resulted in more than
30,000 titles being on file.
Investigative opportunities
What all these numbers sig
nify to a scholar is the possibility
to thoroughly investigate a sub
ject whether it be an intensive
study of a particular country,
war, or revolution, or a broad,
comparative look at a political or
historical phenomenon. The in
stitution has published 275 vol
umes since 1919 when Hoover
founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties," "The North Ko
rean Economy," "Truman, the

Jewish Vote, and the Creation of
Israel," "Yearbook on Interna
tional Communist Affairs: 1973
(seventh in a series)," and "A
Chinese-English Dictionary of
Communist Chinese Terminol
ogy."
As American Relief Administ
ration Director in Europe during
World War I, Hoover began his
collection with the help of Stan
ford professors Ephraim Adams
and Ralph Lutz. He hoped that
the materials they gathered
would provide the data, with
which future historians could
work. Lutz became the institu

tion's director in 1925.
Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in various
places on campus many in the
main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the mas
ses of documents the collecting
team sent back at the end of the
year.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, the founders
set about raising money. By
1939, they were ready to start the
tower, which was dedicated in
1941.
