The Leland Stanford Junior
Museum stands majestically at
the end of Museum Way.
Like any museum, it is full of
the paintings, sculpture, and
pottery of the past priceless
testimony of lost civilizations or
examples of more contemporary
artists.
But the Stanford museum
claims a unique legacy: an entire
room devoted to the history of
the family who founded the
University.
Leland and Jane Lathrop Stan
ford built the museum and the
University as memorials to their
son Leland Jr., who died at 16.
The museum, built in stages
from 1894, was modeled after a
building in Athens. It was origi
nally much larger than it is now,
extending into what is now the
anatomy building. But the 1906
earthquake destroyed the back
section; the remaining front sec
tion survived because it was
built of reinforced concrete.
Much of the pottery and
sculpture were destroyed.
Were it not for the quake, the
museum would have been the

largest private musuem in the
world. Today, the Historical As
sociation of American Public
Works considers it one of the
most significant buildings west
of the Mississippi for its struc
ture and historical content.
The Stanford room, and other
parts of the museum, detail
much of the history of the family,
from its early business ventures
to little Leland's playthings.
Married in 1850, the couple
moved to Sacramento from the
upper Midwest, where Stanford
purchased his brother's store.
He later helped build, and was
president of, the Southern
Pacific Railroad. At first seen as a
risky financial venture, it later
proved to be a most lucrative in
vestment and helped to support
the University.
As a tribute to Stanford's ven
ture, the museum has a safe dis
playing a gold and silver spike,
symbols of the joining of the
Central and Union Pacific in
Promontory, Utah, which
formed the first transcontinental
line. Stanford was present at the
ceremony.
Among Stanford's other in

terests was the fledgling art of
motion picture photography.
Stanford hired the services of
San Francisco photographer
Edward Muybridge to prove that
when a horse is in motion, all its
hoofs can be off the ground at
once.
Muybridge placed, under a
layer of dirt, a wire connected to
a camera. When the horse ran
over the wire, a photograph was
taken. A series of photographs
was placed on a disc which
when rotated looked like a horse

in motion. A sequence of photos,
on display in the Stanford room
show that Stanford was correct.
During the Civil War, Stanford
helped keep California on the
Union side and organized the
Republican party for Lincoln.
He was governor of California at
the time. After that, in 1885, he
was elected Senator. His blue
Civil War uniform with gold but
tons and epaulets is preserved
under glass in the room.
