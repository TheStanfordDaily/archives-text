# Time capsule, gift mark Class Day rite

### Jack Vaughn 
A swingset for University students
and funds to set up student conserva
tion projects are among the gifts plan
ned by the Class of 1977.
Senior class co-president Jamie
Grodsky said approximately $2500 in
senior class funds will be divided bet
ween gifts to Volunteers in Asia; the
Heritage Fund, a scholarship fund
administered by the Office of Finan
cial Aids; the Club Sports Council; the
Energy Conservation Center; a special
fund within the Energy Conservation
Center to promote student projects;
and the swingset.
The swingset, which Grodsky esti
mated would cost the senior class
around $550, will probably be con
structed in the vacant field between
558 Mayfield and Florence Moore
Hall.
"The swingset will be something
novel — a good way to release ten
sions," Grodsky said. "It will give stu
dents a chance to play without being
embarrassed about it."
Grodsky said she has been in contact
with Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and University Housing Direc
tor Ed Scoles, who have expressed in
terest in the project.
She described the swingset as a
four-seat model "designed foradults."
Co-president Mike Dorsey said the
class presidents hope to fund a portion
of one student's tuition through the
gift to the Heritage Fund. He said the
fund, set up by the Class of 1955, tradi
tionally received a portion of the class
gift but that the tradition lapsed in re
cent years and this year's class plans to
revive it.
The funds for the Energy Conserva
tion Office will go to pay for conserva
tion films, solar energy projects, re
cycling projects and the like, accord
ing to Grodsky. She said the fund for
student projects would be separate
from the general fund contributions.
The class presidents are attempting
to fund special projects for all gift reci
pients, co-president Risa Shimoda
said. In this way, seniors will have a
tangible gift to remember.
Co-president Dave Treinis said ideas
for the gift, along with suggestions for
items to be placed in the Quad time
capsule and for Class Day speakers,
were solicited six weeks ago in White
Plaza. Following this, Treinis said, the
presidents interviewed individuals
and potential recipient organizations
before deciding on the gift.
Dorsey said money for the gift has
come from t-shirt sales, the Class Day
luncheon and a contribution from the
Bookstore out of proceeds on cap and
gown rentals and graduation an
nouncements.
Grodsky said the presidents are now
working on a waiver option for stu
dents returning their caps and gowns
to give their deposit to specified or

ganizations not included among class
gift recipients.
The Quad time capsule, to be placed
under a brass plaque bearing the
number 77 Saturday afternoon follow
ing the baccalaureate service, will con
tain a number of artifacts from the pre
sent era.
"We're going to try to put in things
we thing are symbolic of our era and
the kinds of things students have been
interested in and concerned with,"
Dorsey said.
In addition to newspaper articles
highlighting the events of the past four
years, Grodsky said "we're putting in
some things we think might be obso
lete in the future — like a vial of water,
some fossil fuel, some saccharine, the
Pill."
Also included among the era's sym
bols will be items such as tennis
shorts, wedge-heeled shoes, black
armbands and United Farm Worker
union emblems symbolizing student
activism, photos of streakers from
1974 and momentos from some of the
overseas campuses which may be ph
ased out before the capsule is opened.
Treinis said the presidents have also
placed "technological time-marks like
pop-tops" in the capsule. Samples of
housing draw numbers and compara
tive tuition checks from 1973 and 1977
will find their places in the "hermeti
cally sealed" box, he said.
Provost William Miller is scheduled
to make a short speech on the time
capsule tradition prior to its installa
tion at 3:45 p.m.
The capsule is supposed to be
opened in 2077, according to tradition,
but Shimoda said "people at the
alumni association say that at 50-year
reunions people start wanting to open
them and they might start opening
them then."
The time capsule ceremony will be
proceded by the baccalaureate service,
which will follow the Class Day lunc
heon scheduled for 11:30 a.m.-1:30
p.m. Saturday. Dorsey said the pur
pose of the luncheon is "to get parents
and students together and to hear some
of the most inspirational professors
address them."
He said Donald Kennedy, former
professor of biological sciences and
commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration; Prof. James Adams,
associate dean of the Engineering
School; and Nannerl Keohane, assis
tant professor of political science, will
address the graduates and their pa
rents at the luncheon.
In addition, Alumni Association
President Steven Home will speak,
along with President Richard Lyman,
who will accept the class gift for the
University.
After the time capsule ceremony,
graduates and their families will be in
vited to a reception and open house at
Lyman's home.
