# Tennis, field hockey, water polo champs
## Class of 77: Four years in sports 
### Chris Baker 
Two NCAA tennis titles. An
NCAA water polo crown. Two
straight NCIAC regional field
hockey championships. The
achievements of the Class of
1977 are almost endless.
Four years ago, one of the most
talented groups of football
players anywhere in the nation
came to the Farm. Its goal was a
trip to the Rose Bowl.
That group never made it but it
treated fans to exciting football,
on and off the field. A last
second win over Cal in the 1974
Big Game and a similar effort
against USC in 1975 are two con
tests which go down along side
the 1971 Rose Bowl victory over
Michigan.
And that sad Big Game Eve,
the day a football coach with a
winning record was given the
ax, will occupy a couple of chap
ters when volume two of the
Color of Life is Red is written.
By not winning enough games
to get to the Rose Bowl, the Class

of 1977 probably contributed as
much to former coach Jack Chris
tiansen's downfall as the quar
terback debate.
But Stanford still had more
players taken in last month's
NFL draft than football power
Notre Dame. Five Stanford
players will be at pro football
training camps next month, hop
ing to make final rosters.
Flanker Tony Hill, who now
owns all the career receiving re
cords here, has signed a contract
with the Dallas Cowboys. The
addition of Hill gives Dallas five
former Stanford players, more
than any other NFL club.
Duncan McColl, a UPI All-
American pick, will join George
Allen's "Over The Hill Gang" —
The Washington Redskins.
Mike Cordova, who was booed
many times during his career on
the Farm, should be ready for the
Philadelphia Eagles' fans.
Mike Michel will be trying to
make the Miami Dolphins and
tackle Gary Anderson hopes to

join the Detroit Lions.
Stanford players are success
ful off the field too. Three years
ago nobody wanted Donny
Stevenson in the starting
backfield. Today, after back-to
back berths on the Academic
All-America team, Stevenson is
heading for USC Medical
School.
"The best waterpolo goalie in
the world" — Chris Dorst is also
a member of the Class of 1977.
Dorst, an all-tournament selec
tion at the NCAA water polo
tourney, helped lead Stanford to
its first NCAA waterpolo title
last November.
Kathy Levinson is the first
female athlete at Stanford to re
ceive a lettermen's blanket —
given to four year letter winners.
Three years ago just a
handful of friends would come
to field hockey games. But last
year's Regional tournament
drew over 500 spectators.
Guard Mike Bratz really
came into his own during the

season. The co-captain averaged
just under 20 points and made
the All-Pac-8 team. Bratz should
have a pro basketball career
ahead, if he continues to im
prove.
For most of his four years at
Stanford, swimmer Dave Fair
bank was known as something of
an oddity. He slept late and
sometimes missed early morn
ing practices, and he went to par
ties nights before meets.
But last March, Fairbank
brought back an NCAA crown in
the 100 freestyle.
Four years ago, women's
swimming wasn't exactly a
major sport on the Farm. But
with an outpouring of financial
support and athletes like Vicki
Hays, the women's swimming
program is at the top.
Terry Albritton set all kinds of
Stanford shot putting records
when he was a freshman here in
1972. But then he left and went
to the University of Hawaii.
After Hawaii dropped its track
program earlier this year, he
came back to the Farm.
Albritton's NCAA shot put
title helped Stanford to a 10th
place tie in the NCAA meet.
