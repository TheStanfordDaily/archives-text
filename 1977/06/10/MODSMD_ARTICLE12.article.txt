Ten Stanford faculty members have received
Guggenheim Fellowships for 1977, enabling them
to pursue a year of independent research on topics
as varied as organometallic chemistry, altruism as
an outcome of social interaction and political
analysis of international economic policy coordi
nation.
Three hundred and thirteen fellowships were
awarded nationally by the John Simon
Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to scholars,
scientists and artists chosen from among 3050

the future," represented by submission of a prop

well as recognition of previous achievements.
Each fellow receives a grant based on a tentative
budget for his proposal, submitted after prelimi

The subjects proposed by the fellows run
through all of science, scholarship and the arts.
Samuel Berman, a professor associated with the
Stanford Li near Accelerator Center, will devote his
study to energy technology as it relates to public
policy. James Collman, professor of chemistry,
will do research in synthetic organometallic
chemistry.
The American poetic renaissance, 1910-1930,
