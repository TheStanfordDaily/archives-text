# What will Stanford be like in 1987?
## Campus construction complete 
### Will Nixon 
When the Class of 1977 has its
10-year reunion, Stanford won't
look so different though it will
have fewer construction sites
and half-finished fountains.
"Stanford is very different
now than it was 10 years ago,"
said Director of Planning Philip
Williams, "But the changes over
the next 10 years will not be so
dramatic.
"We are at the end of a boom
and are moving into a period of
consolidating what we have."
All current construction will
be completed within two years.
The Frederick E. Terman En

gineering Building is almost
finished now. The Tanner foun
tain in front of Hoover Tower
should be completed by fall and
the bookstore addition will be
done early next year.
The Hoover library addition,
which is the federal memorial to
Herbert Hoover, should be
finished by December and
should be open by February.
Next door, the main library addi
tion should be done in two years.
Renovation is going strong at
Margaret Jacks Hall, the old
physiology section, in the Outer
Quad. Bids to renovate the
Quad's history corner will go out

this month.
"We do hope to complete the
renovation of the main Quad,"
said Williams, which means re
doing the engineering and geol
ogy corners. Williams also
hoped the inner Quad will get
better pavement and the plant
ing areas will be expanded.
"There should be a significant
upgranding in the landscape at
Stanford," said Provost Ed
Shaw, executing assistant to the
vice president. Both Williams
and Shaw mentioned Lasuane
Mall, in front of main library, as a
target area for relandscaping.
Replanting is needed in Frost

Amphitheater, and a lot of work
is needed on the arboretum,
especially in the cactus garden.
Williams hoped the oval can be
regreened and cleaned. He also
said Galvez Mall is another
target.
However, there is a
moratorium on all landscape
improvements during the
drought. "One thing I hope
seniors will see if they return in
10 years is water in Lake
Lagunita," Williams added.
Despite this emphasis on
finishing and rehabilitating
what is already at Stanford, sev
eral buildings should be put up
over the next 10 years.
"A new music building has
been needed for years and
years," said Williams. This
building might go up next to
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
A second medical science
building, like the present Fair
child building, is under consid
eration. Grants have been asked
for research facilities construc
tion.
Money from a recent $300
million campaign has been allo
cated. All of the current building
is financed, but new construc
tion will require money. Stan
ford is already raising funds for
Quad renovation, according to
Vice Provost for Building and
Planning Ray Bacchetti.
Before the present campaign,
which began in 1972, Stanford
received about $30 million a
year in donations, said Vice
President for Development Ken
neth Cuthbertson. The Univer
sity hopes to come out of this
campaign with about $50 mill
ion a year.
Other construction that would
occur, according to Williams,
will get people and facilities out
of "trailers, modulators and
temporaries."
"Manzanita park was meant to
be temporary, and one would
hope they would be replaced,"
said Williams. However, what
sort of student housing would
replace Manzanita has not been
determined.


Finishing the job
The Frederick E. Terman Engineering Building,
shown during an earlier stage of construction, is
now nearing completion. The building is part of

a University-wide planning program which
should be finished by the 10-year reunion of the
Class of 1977.
