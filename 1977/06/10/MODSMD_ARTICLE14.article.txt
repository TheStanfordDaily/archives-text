# Evolution in academics

Academic programs here will
go through "evolutionary not
revolutionary" changes and
growth will be "very moderate"
in the next 10 years, according to
Provost William Miller and Ray
Bacchetti, vice-provost for
budget and planning.
Evolutionary changes in cur
riculum will come as a response
to new problems being tackled
by researchers here which then
"trickle down to the graduate
and undergraduate programs,"
Miller said.
One result will be more inter
disciplinary work because stu-

dents have found "more interac
tion (and) more unification" of
material in different disciplines,
Miller added.
Herant Katchadourian, a dean
of undergraduate studies,
echoed Miller, adding he
thought there will be more
"coherence" within under
graduate classes and programs
like the western culture re
quirement being instituted next
year.
Students in the next decade
will probably take a more active
role in "defining their educa
tion" by demanding more
academic programs that have an
"active concern in public pol
icy," according to Katchadou
rian. The present program in
human biology, the proposed
honors program in social
thought and institutions and the
possible program on public pol

icy, are examples of public pol
icy oriented programs, he added.
The next 10 years will also
bring a "greater emphasis on
teaching excellence and accoun
tability" and more women stu
dents will be aimed towards pro
fessional careers, Katchadourian
said.
He said the current opinion
here is that "teaching compe
tence should not be taken for
granted" and added that "I hope
the trend (toward mandatory
course evaluation and other
proposals to improve teaching
quality) will not be seen at the
expense of scholarship and re
search. 1 don't think the two are
antagonistic."
Katchadourian also said that
he thought that because of a
greater involvement of women
in the professions, women here
would become more conscious
of the opportunities and would
be on a more equal level with
men facing the same "problems
and opportunities."
Academic programs in
graduate departments also will
reflect more interdisciplinary
work in the future according to
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of
graduate studies. He said that
because of graduate specials,
graduate students can do more
mterdiacipliiiary work than in
the past, "I assume new areas
will come into being by merging
programs now thought of as in
dependent disciplines."
A problem faced by graduate
departments is the small number
of students, a reflection of the
weak job market for Ph.Ds in re
cent years according to Car
nochan. Most departments are at
the "lower limit" and if we go
much lower we'd be doing dam
age to the continuity of the dis
cipline and the integrity of the
program," he added.
Miller agrees that gradute en
rollment is low and said that in
the future enrollment may be al
lowed to rise to the peak levels of
1974 but that costs will prevent
it from going any higher.
According to Bacchetti the last

budget cuts made under the
University's budget equilibrium
plan will come next year and
that after that "growth will be
very moderate." There is not
enough money to "maintain the
growth of the last 20 years,"
when new programs would be
financed by increasing enroll
ment.
Bacchetti says he does not for
see some of the programs which
were eliminated under the
budget trimming reappearing
now that the budget is balanced.
He said reinstituting them
would throw the budget im
mediately out of balance.
Miller said if problems arise
because of high program ex
penses "we can treat them as
more slowly changing rather
than as abrupt problems." Still,
there will be a continuing chal
lenge to do things "more effi
ciently" due to the money
crunch, he added.
Reduction in income or sud
den increases in expenses could
trigger a new round of cuts ac
cording to Bacchetti.
Miller said if budget cuts have
to be made, in the future services
such as energy and libraries
would probably be cut back be
fore academic programs. He did
say however, that non-financial
factors such as the rest of the
University "outgrowing" a stag
nating program might lead to the
elimination of parts of the cur
riculum.
In general, "reallocation" of
funds and personnel will take
place rather than the addition of
many more teachers and prog
rams, Miller said. Some things
will rise to a higher priority, so
other things will have to fall off
the other end," he said. The pro
cess would be very slow moving
however, he added.
Katchadourian said that he is
"generally quite positive about
what is happening at Stanford,"
but cautioned that it is "impor
tant that Stanford maintain its
excellence as a research institu
tion as well as excellent under
graduate teaching."

search. 1 don't think the two are
antagonistic."
Katchadourian also said that
he thought that because of a
greater involvement of women
in the professions, women here
would become more conscious
of the opportunities and would
be on a more equal level with
men facing the same "problems
and opportunities."
Academic programs in
graduate departments also will
reflect more interdisciplinary
work in the future according to
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of
graduate studies. He said that
because of graduate specials,
graduate students can do more
mterdiacipliiiary work than in
the past, "I assume new areas
will come into being by merging
programs now thought of as in
dependent disciplines."
A problem faced by graduate
departments is the small number
of students, a reflection of the
weak job market for Ph.Ds in re
cent years according to Car
nochan. Most departments are at
the "lower limit" and if we go
much lower we'd be doing dam
age to the continuity of the dis
cipline and the integrity of the
program," he added.
Miller agrees that gradute en
rollment is low and said that in
the future enrollment may be al
lowed to rise to the peak levels of
1974 but that costs will prevent
it from going any higher.
According to Bacchetti the last

budget cuts made under the
University's budget equilibrium
plan will come next year and
that after that "growth will be
very moderate." There is not
enough money to "maintain the
growth of the last 20 years,"
when new programs would be
financed by increasing enroll
ment.
Bacchetti says he does not for
see some of the programs which
were eliminated under the
budget trimming reappearing
now that the budget is balanced.
He said reinstituting them
would throw the budget im
mediately out of balance.
Miller said if problems arise
because of high program ex
penses "we can treat them as
more slowly changing rather
than as abrupt problems." Still,
there will be a continuing chal
lenge to do things "more effi
ciently" due to the money
crunch, he added.
Reduction in income or sud
den increases in expenses could
trigger a new round of cuts ac
cording to Bacchetti.
Miller said if budget cuts have
to be made, in the future services
such as energy and libraries
would probably be cut back be
fore academic programs. He did
say however, that non-financial
factors such as the rest of the
University "outgrowing" a stag
nating program might lead to the
elimination of parts of the cur
riculum.
In general, "reallocation" of
funds and personnel will take
place rather than the addition of
many more teachers and prog
rams, Miller said. Some things
will rise to a higher priority, so
other things will have to fall off
the other end," he said. The pro
cess would be very slow moving
however, he added.
Katchadourian said that he is
"generally quite positive about
what is happening at Stanford,"
but cautioned that it is "impor
tant that Stanford maintain its
excellence as a research institu
tion as well as excellent under
graduate teaching."

Academic programs here will
go through "evolutionary not
revolutionary" changes and
growth will be "very moderate"
in the next 10 years, according to
Provost William Miller and Ray
Bacchetti, vice-provost for
budget and planning.
Evolutionary changes in cur
riculum will come as a response
to new problems being tackled
by researchers here which then
"trickle down to the graduate
and undergraduate programs,"
Miller said.
One result will be more inter
disciplinary work because stu-

dents have found "more interac
tion (and) more unification" of
material in different disciplines,
Miller added.
Herant Katchadourian, a dean
of undergraduate studies,
echoed Miller, adding he
thought there will be more
"coherence" within under
graduate classes and programs
like the western culture re
quirement being instituted next
year.
Students in the next decade
will probably take a more active
role in "defining their educa
tion" by demanding more
academic programs that have an
"active concern in public pol
icy," according to Katchadou
rian. The present program in
human biology, the proposed
honors program in social
thought and institutions and the
possible program on public pol

icy, are examples of public pol
icy oriented programs, he added.
The next 10 years will also
bring a "greater emphasis on
teaching excellence and accoun
tability" and more women stu
dents will be aimed towards pro
fessional careers, Katchadourian
said.
He said the current opinion
here is that "teaching compe
tence should not be taken for
granted" and added that "I hope
the trend (toward mandatory
course evaluation and other
proposals to improve teaching
quality) will not be seen at the
expense of scholarship and re
search. 1 don't think the two are
antagonistic."

He said reinstituting them
would throw the budget im
mediately out of balance.
Miller said if problems arise
because of high program ex
penses "we can treat them as
more slowly changing rather
than as abrupt problems." Still,
there will be a continuing chal
lenge to do things "more effi
ciently" due to the money
crunch, he added.
Reduction in income or sud
den increases in expenses could
trigger a new round of cuts ac
cording to Bacchetti.
Miller said if budget cuts have
to be made, in the future services
such as energy and libraries
would probably be cut back be
fore academic programs. He did
say however, that non-financial
factors such as the rest of the
University "outgrowing" a stag
nating program might lead to the
elimination of parts of the cur
riculum.
In general, "reallocation" of
funds and personnel will take
place rather than the addition of
many more teachers and prog
rams, Miller said. Some things
will rise to a higher priority, so
other things will have to fall off
the other end," he said. The pro
cess would be very slow moving
however, he added.
Katchadourian said that he is
"generally quite positive about
what is happening at Stanford,"
but cautioned that it is "impor
tant that Stanford maintain its
excellence as a research institu
tion as well as excellent under
graduate teaching."
