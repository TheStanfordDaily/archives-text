# Changes in student government
## ASSU debates bylaws, recall 
### Jill Liscom 
Bylaw changes, recall attempts and im
proved communication among students,
administrators and student government
were the major issues faced by this year's
ASSU Senate and Council of Presidents
(COP).
A series of 10 bylaw amendments and
seven constitutional amendments were
proposed by a SWOPS I course led by COP
Vice President Carole Houck. The class was
designed to consider changes that needed to
be made in student government here as a
fulfillment of one of the COP slate's cam
paign promises.
The senate passed seven of the bylaw
amendments in May, and six of the constitu
tional amendments were placed on the
spring ballot. The main change was making
the COP a council of four co-presidents in
stead of one made of of a president and three
vice presidents.
A bylaw amendment submitted by
Sen. Jeff Stoler was passed winter quarter
instructing the ASSU financial manager to
allow each organization to give out its own
refunds in White Plaza.
However, when it came time for spring

quarter refunds to be given out, financial
manager Chris Mathe decided to continue
distributing refunds in the ASSU office for
money-saving and security reasons.
Since Mathe was disregarding the senate's
instructions, Stoler and Sen. Jim King staged
a fake attempt to have Mathe recalled. The
senate finally solved the problem by having
Mathe issue vouchers in White Plaza which
could be redeemed in the ASSU office for a
cash refund.
Claiming that Stoler, King and Sen. Tom
Devine had been irresponsible in their duties
to the graduate constituency, COP Vice Pres
ident Deric Jennings circulated petitions to
have the senators recalled. No recall election
was held, however, because Jennings did not
obtain enough signatures.
Another change initiated by Stoler to
"bring student governments closer to the
students" was to begin holding the senate
meetings in student residences rather than
in the Graduate School of Business.
The most outstanding accomplishment of
the COP this year was its task force on Te
nure and Teaching Quality, which was set
up at the beginning of last summer.
One of the most controversial issues in the

senate this year was an amendment to make
salaries of COP members contingent upon a
fee assessment which would have appeared
on the spring ballot. The bill was initially
passed by the senate but was vetoed by
ASSU President Vic Petroff.
According to Petroff, this policy would be
discriminating against those students who
would like to run for COP, but who would
not be able to without knowing if they would
be paid. The senate failed to override the
veto, but the proposal was rewritten to in
clude a provision for financial aid to be given
to a COP member if necessary.
The new amendment was passed again by
the senate and was not vetoed. However, be
cause there was a discrepancy over the elec
tion procedure, a re-election was held at the
next meeting, and the amendment did not
pass.
The senate was successful, however, in
putting several referendums on the spring
ballot. Asked to vote on making fee assess
ments purely voluntary, initiating a western
civilization requirement and initiating a
foreign language requirement, students
voted against all three resolutions.

senate finally solved the problem by having
Mathe issue vouchers in White Plaza which
could be redeemed in the ASSU office for a
cash refund.
Claiming that Stoler, King and Sen. Tom
Devine had been irresponsible in their duties
to the graduate constituency, COP Vice Pres
ident Deric Jennings circulated petitions to
have the senators recalled. No recall election
was held, however, because Jennings did not
obtain enough signatures.
Another change initiated by Stoler to
"bring student governments closer to the
students" was to begin holding the senate
meetings in student residences rather than
in the Graduate School of Business.
The most outstanding accomplishment of
the COP this year was its task force on Te
nure and Teaching Quality, which was set
up at the beginning of last summer.
One of the most controversial issues in the

senate this year was an amendment to make
salaries of COP members contingent upon a
fee assessment which would have appeared
on the spring ballot. The bill was initially
passed by the senate but was vetoed by
ASSU President Vic Petroff.
According to Petroff, this policy would be
discriminating against those students who
would like to run for COP, but who would
not be able to without knowing if they would
be paid. The senate failed to override the
veto, but the proposal was rewritten to in
clude a provision for financial aid to be given
to a COP member if necessary.
The new amendment was passed again by
the senate and was not vetoed. However, be
cause there was a discrepancy over the elec
tion procedure, a re-election was held at the
next meeting, and the amendment did not
pass.
The senate was successful, however, in
putting several referendums on the spring
ballot. Asked to vote on making fee assess
ments purely voluntary, initiating a western
civilization requirement and initiating a
foreign language requirement, students
voted against all three resolutions.
Bylaw changes, recall attempts and im
proved communication among students,
administrators and student government
were the major issues faced by this year's
ASSU Senate and Council of Presidents
(COP).
A series of 10 bylaw amendments and
seven constitutional amendments were
proposed by a SWOPS I course led by COP
Vice President Carole Houck. The class was
designed to consider changes that needed to
be made in student government here as a
fulfillment of one of the COP slate's cam
paign promises.
The senate passed seven of the bylaw
amendments in May, and six of the constitu
tional amendments were placed on the
spring ballot. The main change was making
the COP a council of four co-presidents in
stead of one made of of a president and three
vice presidents.
A bylaw amendment submitted by
Sen. Jeff Stoler was passed winter quarter
instructing the ASSU financial manager to
allow each organization to give out its own
refunds in White Plaza.
However, when it came time for spring

quarter refunds to be given out, financial
manager Chris Mathe decided to continue
distributing refunds in the ASSU office for
money-saving and security reasons.
Since Mathe was disregarding the senate's
instructions, Stoler and Sen. Jim King staged
a fake attempt to have Mathe recalled. The
senate finally solved the problem by having
Mathe issue vouchers in White Plaza which
could be redeemed in the ASSU office for a
cash refund.
