# Alumni Association goal: 'continuing education'
## 
### Jacob Young 
The Alumni Association. At most schools, it is
a central distributor for endless PR releases
about "the growing plans at State," and is most
evident through constant pleas for cash.
Not so here.
The major objective of the Stanford Alumni
Association, is "continuing education. We try
to keep alumni involved in the University, and
to perform the job of continuing education,"
according to Millie kirby, assistant director
membership for the association.
Hopefully, by keeping graduates involved,
the University and the alums will both be
served, Kirby said.
Perhaps the most beneficial program of the
association is the series of summer colleges,
conferences, forums and speeches, most of
which are directed by Stanford professors and
deal with special areas of education.
For example, this summer's Alumni College,
running from July 22-31, will be entitled
"Communicating," and will examine various
facets of communica'ting, both on a one-to-one
basis and to groups. In August, the association
will sponsor a conference on design, which will
present a number of aspects of design and art
development, taught by experts in the field.
For most of these classes and colleges, there is
a tuition fee; most of the classes are given here.
With a membership of nearly 43,000, the
Stanford Association is one of the largest of its
type. Not every graduate is automatically a
member, the case at many schools. Membership
is granted only after paying dues; however, sev
eral alternatives to shelling out $150, in one
payment are offered.
Of special interest to recent graduates is a
reduced student membership, with an option of

paying the total cost in installments over a five
year period. The reduced student rate is offered
for one year after graduation.
One important fact about the association sur
prises most grads â€” the association solicits al
most no funds. Since it is totally independent
from the University, there is funding for some
programs, but the majority of requests for dona
tions come from the University through the
Ceneral Secretaries Office, according to Kirby.
The association also has an active system of
clubs in major cities across the country. The
activities of the clubs vary, but a speaking tour
of Stanford professors is arranged for the clubs
almost every year, Kirby said.
Another very valuable service of the associa
tion is its role as intermediate "postal service"
for locating former friends or Stanford
classmates. Since all alumni addresses are con
fidential information, letters to lost friends can
be sent to the association for forwarding.
"Some people have even sent their Christmas
cards for mailing," Kirby said. Since this is an
often-used service, alums are urged to notify the
association each time they change addresses.
In addition to the colleges and lectures, the
association publishes the Stanford Magazine
and the Portable Stanford, a quarterly digest
which gives an indepth presentation of the re
search given at Stanford in a particular field.
The Alumni Almanac allows members to keep
up with the movings and lives of other alums.
The association also sponsors the Stanford
Sierra Camp, near Lake Tahoe, which offers
summer programs. The camp is staffed mostly
by currently-enrolled students, so it provides a
contact between the University and alums. The
association also operates the Stanford Alpine
Chalet at Alpine Meadows near Lake Tahoe.
