# Historian Franklin to address grads
## 
### Jordan Lorence 
In 1833, a group of Chickasaw In
dians packed their belongings and
moved with their black slaves from
Alabama to Oklahoma. The federal
government forced them to move west.
One slave, David Franklin, thought
only of freedom. When they reached
Oklahoma, he ran away. Franklin
fought for the Union Army during the
Civil War, later married a woman who
was half-Indian and settled on a ranch
deeded him by the federal govern
ment.
His son, Buck Colbert Franklin, at
tended Roger Williams University in
Nashville. He returned to the all-black
town of Rentiesville, Okla., where he
became the town's postmaster, notary
public and only lawyer.
And his son, John Hope, born in the
back of the post office in 1915, has
become one of the nation's foremost
historians on the South and chairman
of the history departments at Brooklyn
College and the University of Chicago.
New chapter
This weekend, the family's story
launches another chapter as John Hope
Franklin, the John Manley Distin
guished Service Professor at the Uni
versity of Chicago, delivers the com
mencement address at Stanford Uni
versity.
Franklin's work on Southern history
has been outstanding. His best-known
work. From Slavery to Freedom, pub
lished in 1947, became a standard col
lege text. Reconstruction after the
Civil War, sold 300,000 copies after its
publication in 1961.
In all, he has written, edited or con
tributed to 30 history books and 50
journal articles. He has taught at uni
versities on six continents. He has
been president of the United Chapters
of Phi Beta Kappa, the Organization of
American Historians, and was the first
black president of the Southern Histor
ical Society.
Black scholars
In 1963, he wrote about the difficul
ties of the black scholar. "I speak of his
dual role — that he has to be like any
other scholar in his field. He must
adhere to the highest standards in his
field, but he must also be an advocate
for justice and equality so he can be
heard as a scholar and survive as a
human being."
But Franklin is not simply a black
writing about black history. "Why
should I paint myself into a corner?"
he asks. "I don't think you have to be
white to write about white people. I
don't teach black history at the Univer
sity of Chicago. I teach the history of
the South — black and white."
Franklin's scholarly achievements
did not come easily. He grew up in a
cruel time, but learned early from his
father to stand up against southern
segregation.
Never groveled
"I never saw him go into a toilet
marked 'colored,' " Franklin recalls.
"He'd go into the first toilet came to
and so would I. He paid no attention to

segregation in the courtroom. When I
would visit him in court he'd ignore
the huddle of Negroes off in one corner
and sit me down at the lawyers' table
or in the jury box."
After graduating from Tulsa High
School at age 16, Franklin attended
Fisk University in Nashville. There, he
learned to love history. He took an
American history class as an elective
and was overwhelmed.
"I knew that a historian was what I
wanted to be," Franklin says."I was
utterly fascinated with the puzzle of
putting things together from small
clues, from trying to understand the
present by looking at the past."'
Harvard time
Franklin entered Harvard during the
Great Depression and earned his mas
ter's and doctorate in history. He put

himself through school by waiting on
tables and doing secretarial work.
Prejudice against blacks worked in
his favor when he researched his doc
toral dissertation, The Free Negro in
North Carolina, 1790-1860. It was im
possible for Franklin to sit in the same
reading room as white scholars at the
North Carolina State Archives. The
people at the archives cleared out a
special room and set up a desk and
typewriter for Franklin.
Also, he was given a key to the
locked storage shelves, because it was
considered unsightly for white pages
to fill the orders of a black researcher.
"That was a fantastic break for me,"
Franklin notes. "The other researchers
had to fret and fume and wait for a half
hour every time they filled out a re
quest slip for a certain manuscript.

And all the time they could see me
loading up a cart with everything 1
wanted and wheeling it into the pri
vacy of my own workroom.
"That didn't last very long. The ar
chives director called me in after a
week to say that the white scholars had
all complained about my having a key
and could he please have it back."
Social justice
Franklin's historical works have not
only advanced the understanding of
the past, but also furthered the cause of
social justice. In 1954, the Supreme
Court asked attorney Thurgood Mar
shall (now a justice on the Court) to
present the case against racially
segregated schools for the NAACP in
the famous Brown v. Board of Educa
tion case.
Marshall asked Franklin to help him
answer the historical questions the
court had raised. Franklin grappled for
three months with the question of
whether the Fourteenth Amendment,
passed in 1868 to provide equal pro
tection of the laws, regardless of race,
was intended to end racial segregation
in public schools.
Franklin's findings helped convince
the Supreme Court to outlaw segre
gated schools in a landmark decision.
"This is one of the best examples I
know of historians influencing public
policy," Franklin says.
Still a scholar
And, although he has risen to great
ness amid the praises and accolades of
many, Franklin remains a history
scholar.
"I've had all sorts of jobs offered to
me, but I don't want them," says
Franklin. "I always keep my eye on my
main objective — to be a historian.
Whatever reputation I have stands on
that.
"There are a vast number of blacks
who could have been distinguished
scholars, but they have been lured to
other jobs — such as university presi
dents and government officials — but
few have made a reputation in scholar
ship.
"That's why I've never become a
dean, a university president or an am
bassador. 1 could have been all of th
ose. But I wanted to remain a scholar."
