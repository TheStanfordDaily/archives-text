# Science, humanities majors' graduate job prospects differ

Using last year's statistics as a guide,
Career Planning and Placement Center
Director Ralph Keller predicts
graduate job placements will continue
their current upward trend, with most
Stanford grads finding employment.
Though he admits this upswing wil 1
not last much longer, Keller said
placement rates among Stanford
graduates have continued to increase
over the last 10 years.
Engineering and science majors will
again have better chances than liberal
arts grads in the job market, Keller
said.
There is a job available for every
Stanford engineer, according to
George Janes, CPPC director of en
gineering and science placement.
Generally students in the sciences
will also do well, he said.
Salaries are continuing upward
James said. "Recruiters have a bright
employment outlook for engineers,"
he said.
One reason for the very positive
prospect for engineers is the prestige
of the engineering school here, James
said.
In the sciences, the prospects vary
by to James. A
much larger percentage of students
graduating with a bachelor of science

degree aregoing on to graduate school,
he said.
The math-sciences major is very
successful, James said.
The percentage of science graduates
with a B.S. or masters degree on the job
market today is lower than in past
years, James said. Many students earn
a doctorate in order to do research
and/or teach, he said.
The trend is increasing for women
entering engineering, according to
James. Twenty to 30 years ago, there
was a fractional percentage of women
in engineering, he said. "The numbers
are increasing dramatically," he ad
ded.
"There is a conscious effort on the
part of the University to encourage
women in engineering," James said.
This is one reason for the increase in
the number of women engineers here.
"Companies are delighted to hire wo
men," he said.
The increasing number of minority
students entering engineering is not as
dramatic as that of women, according
to James.
Liberal arts students must have prac
tical experience in some skill if they
wish to do well after graduation, ac
cording to D.L. Wormley, director of
liberal arts placement at the CPPC.
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC).

"A student's major doesn't necessar
ily have anything to do with jobs. It's
the skills," Wormley said.
There has been a dramatic increase
in the number of women in business in
the last three years, according to
Wormley.
Some companies do discriminate
against minority students, according
to Wormley, although not blatantly. It
depends on each individual recruiter,
she said. Although companies change
their policies to prevent discrimina
tion, "People still stay the same."
In addition to the problem of com
panies discriminating, minority stu
dents traditionally do not use place
ment centers, Wormley said.
It is important for all liberal arts stu
dents to define their needs before look
ing for a job, according to Wormley.
Students must decide what makes
them different from all others, she ad
ded.
People who wait unitl the last mi
nute to find a job have a big problem,
Wormley said.
According to Wormley, students can
acquire skills in many ways outside
the classroom. Jobs, volunteer work,
and hobbies are all good ways of ac
quiring skills, she said. There is very
little vocational training here, she ad
ded.
