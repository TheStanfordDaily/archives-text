# Past commencements offer color, contrast

At least once a year, the outside
world comes to "The Farm," as
families, friends and other guests
gather for commencement exercises.
In the University's earlier years, the
mood was cheery, innocent and hope
ful. In 1901, for example, the biggest
concern of commencement week
seemed to be keeping the electric
lights going until 2:30 a.m. "so there
will be no possibility of not complet
ing the entire program" of the social
event of the week, Senior Ball.
Those were the days when hard
work still got one places and G.M.
Richardson gave graduates a few
words on "The Gospel of Work."
The Class of '06, knocked a bit off
course by an earthquake, picked up the
pieces in time to hold a somewhat be
lated ceremony on Sept. 15.

They called themselves 'The War Class'
... the class will left 'the institution of
Stanford military training.. .for the be
nefit of those who are to follow.'

Tradition was held firmly in line,
although the class president attempted
an innovation: getting the faculty to
appear in caps and gowns.
The request was rejected; the Com
mittee on Public Exercises said it con
sidered the time "inauspicious for
such an action on the part of the fa
culty." The graduates did appear in
caps and gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going on
and the graduating class was very
much aware of it.
They called themselves "The War
Class" and the cover of the com
mencement issue of The Daily Palo
Alto (predecessor of The Stanford
Daily) showed a row of uniformed
young men stading at attention next to
the U.S. flag.
Class orator VV. Leslie Miller, speak
ing on 'The College Man and the War,"
urged fellow classmates to serve the
nation.
The class will, written by A.H. Em
ery, left "to all the generations of Stan
ford students who are to come . . . the

example of service to the nation in
time of need. . . .
The Class of'l7 also left "the institu
tion of Stanford military training . . .
for the benefit of those who are to fol
low. We hope and indeed know that
they will take full advantage of its be
nefits and that they will be better Stan
ford men and better citizens there
fore."
When the United States began to feel
the great Depression, some may have
doubted that "better times" would
ever come. The Class of '30, however,
made no mention of the hard times.
President Herbert Hoover took time
out from his responsibilities. "Forget
ting the proposed new Tariff Bill
which lies on his desk, the ardent pleas
of prohibitionists and even the call of
the trout in the Rapidan River," he
wired "cordial greetings and warm

congratulations to the graduating
Seniors at Stanford University and my
best wishes for a life of active service
upon which thev now embark."
The commencement address, deli
vered by Dr. John Maxson Stillman,
the retiring vice president of the Uni
versity, discussed "Idealism and Na
tional Policy."
The "brightest hope for the near fu
ture," according to Stillman, was the
establishment of a world court "which
shall unite the nations in an agreement
that shall make forever impossible
such a catastrophe as we now experi
ence."
During the war and after, "it is out
duty to maintain our high ideals. . . .
Success must not tempt us to grasp for
imperial prizes," he cautioned.
In the spirit of patriotism shown by
the other "war class," the Class of '42
gave $1900 in war bonds to the senior
scholarship fund.
Because the war effort ruled out the
use of brass for the class plate in front
of Memorial Church, the class had one

made in two-color reinforced concrete.
Among the 1150 persons graduating
was a John Day Miller, executive of A.
Schilling Co., importers of spices and
coffee in San Francisco. Miller was the
only one to receive a Bachelor of Arts
at Large Degree.
He had left the Univeristy in April
1935, two units short of the 180 re
quired for graduation. Not having a
diploma did not adversely affect him
until an opportunity to be commis
sioned as a lieutenant in the Naval Air
Corps came up and he learned that he
needed a college degree to quality.
So the young executive came back to
the University and was allowed to
prepare a study on "The Effect of the
War on the Spice Business" for two
units.
Another graduate, Martha Hartwig
Tootle, received a unique graduation
present — the ripcord from the
parachute which saved her husband's
life in the Battle of Midway.
The commencement crowd, re
duced to 5000 by Army regulations,
was given reasons for "The Preserva
tion of the University" by Monroe
Emanuel Deutsch, vice president and
provost of the University of California.
"There is great danger that we may
look at all university education
through glasses clouded by the mist of
war," said Deutsch.
"We must take the long look — and
not let the 1942 scene blind us to the
fact that there will be a world after
1942 and 1943."
Deutsch reminded listeners that the
country would need professionals and
scholars in all fields after the war.

... a unique graduation present -the
ripcord from the parachute which
saved her husband's life in the Battle of
Midway.

"And unless those who are not sum
moned to the immediate service of our
nation devote themselves to their
training," he said, "we may enter the
postwar era a generation taught but
one thing — war."

Again, hopes for continued peace
were shattered. The United States
came up with variations on a theme:
there was the Cold War, the Korean
War . . . and the undeclared war in Vie
tnam.
By 1969, antiwar sentiment was ris-

ing. The former speaker of the student
legislature arrived at commencement
exercises in an academic robe and
coolie hat. Other graduates sported
anti-ABM stickers on robes and mor
tarboards.
Disruption threat
There were threats of disruption
from the Students for a Democratic
Society group (which did not
materialize).
Contrasts to the earlier "war classes"
continued to appear. In 1970, some
300 of 1500 graduating chose not to
rent caps and gowns for commence
ment to show their opposition to the
Vietnam war. The $5 that would have
gone to rental fees went to peace
causes.
Members of the class of '71 con
tinued the effort. Some 200 of the 1600
students attending ceremonies did not
rent gowns, contributing the $5 to
groups such as the Committee of Re
sponsibility, which provided medical
care in the United States for war
injured children; the Agape Founda
tion, the San Francisco area project for
non-violent change; and Draft Refuser
Support, a newly-formed group aiding
men facing prison terms for refusing
the draft.
Although radicals handed out Black
Panther newspapers at the entrances to
Frost Ampitheaer, they made no effort
to enter. There were no disruptions, as
had been feared. The University had
banned carrying signs or banners into
the ceremonies, but one graduate wore
a peace symbol on his cap.

The ceremonies went smoothly and
some newspapers referred to 1971 as
the year of "return to tradition," or the
year in which "innovation became
tradition."
Nevertheless, President Richard
Lyman seemed to acknowledge that
the University had not been left un
touched by the changing times. Noting
that it is customary for the University
to wish the departing graduates well
through its president, he commented,
"Now one wonders whether the roles
ought not to be reversed, whether it
ought not to be the departing
graduates who wish the University
well." His remark drew laughter and
applause.
CBS commentator and chief
Washington correspondent Eric
Sevareid, the commencement speaker,
also had a few words on the subject of
unrest.
"Dissent is right and proper — in
deed, vital to our life — but it does not
follow that therefore the more dissent
the better," he said. "It is an eternal
error to believe that a cause considered
righteous sanctifies unrighteous
methods."
Doubts
Like the graduating class, Sevareid

expressed doubts about the United
States' infallibility.
"Our political leaders are learning
that America's reach in the world has
exceeded its grasp; that we can really
give little to other societies that they
can take," he said.
By 1975, it was clear to some that
there was at least one thing the United
States could give to other countries —
the technology and materials neces
sary for nuclear proliferation.
Commencement speaker Daniel Pat
rick Moynihan, U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, warned listeners that
"the spread of plutonium around the
world" creates a threat of planet-wide
"nuclear disaster."
The possibility of an atomic

holocaust "does not at this point arise
primarily from the quest for weapons
development but rather as a by
product of the innocent but urgent
quest for energy," Moynihan
explained.
Separation
Therefore, the problem facing
Americans, he said, "is how to sepa
rate the production of energy from the
proliferation of weapons."
Not all the seniors participating in
commencement were around to hear
Moynihan's warning: approximately
175 of 2000 graduates walked quietly
out of the amphitheater when Moyni
han was introduced and returned
when his speech was over.
The walkout was the culmination of
the controversy which had attended
the selection of Moynihan as com
mencement speaker from the moment
it was announced.
A statement signed by "The Black
Graduating Students" explained that
the aim of the protesters was not to
"disrupt Moynihan's right to free
speech," but rather to draw attention
to the sort of subtle racism exemplified
in Moynihan's 1969 report on the
Negro family.
In that report, Moynihan attributed

the interior social and economic status
of blacks to what he saw as a disinteg
ration of the Nego family.
The protesters' act "drew cheers
from some . . . boos from a few and
stony silence from most," commented
one observer. When one woman per
sisted in applauding for the protesters,
Moynihan told her "please show the
same courtesy as those departing are
showing."
He went on to deliver his speech to
the slightly depleted audience, ending
on a hopeful note. Nuclear arms con
trol, he said, would release "the energy
and creativity of all those employed in
the armaments industries of the world.
It is something the graduates of 1975
mav wish to think about."

tribution made by women to the University than ever
before.


Backs to the man
To the untrained eye, these students could be marching
on their way to receive graduation honors. Actually, they
are some of the 175 students who walked out on former
United Nations Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan

when he spoke at commencement exercises for the
Class of 1975. Moynihan came under fire for supporting
a policy of "benign neglect" toward blacks in a report to
former President Richard Nixon.
