# REVISED HONOR CODE APPROVED
## 
### 
Following is the text of the revised Honor Code,
\ together with provisions concerning its interpretation
and application, which have been adopted unani
) mously and without change on second passage by the
Student Conduct Legislative Council. With the ap
) proval of the President, the revised code and accom
panying provisions will take effect with the start of
J summer quarter June 20.
HONOR CODE
A The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students,
i individual. / and collectively
1) That they will not give or receive aid in examination;
that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in
class work, in the preparation of reports, or any other
work that is to be used by the instructor as the basis
i of grading;
| 2) That they will do their share and take an active part in
seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold
the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.
B. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the
\ honor of its students by refraining from proctoring examina
tions and from taking unusual and unreasonable precautions
to prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above. The
lacultv will also avoid, as far as practicable, academic proce
dures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code.
C. While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to
set academic requirements, the students and faculty will
work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable
academic work.
INTERPRETATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
OF THE HONOR CODE
i 1. General
a) The Honor Code is agreed to by every student who
registers at Stanford University and by every instructor who
accepts an appointment.
b) The Honor Code provides a standard of honesty and
declares that compliance with that standard is to be ex-
I petted. It does not contemplate that the standard will be
self-enforcing but calls on students, faculty, and administra
tion to encourage compliance and to take reasonable steps to
discourage violations. If violations occur, procedures are
, prescribed by the Legislative and Judicial Charter. However.

the Honor Code depends lor its effectiveness primarily on the
individual and collective desire of all members of the commu
nity to prevent and deter violations rather than on pro
ceedings to impose penalties after violations have occurred.
c) It must be understood that the individual and collec
tive responsibility of the students for upholding the Honor
Code (including so-called third party responsibility) was not
imposed upon the students by the administration or the
faculty but was assumed by the students at their own
request. Without such student responsibility, the Honor Code
cannot be effectively maintained.
d) In interpreting and applying the general provisions of
the Honor Code, it should be kept in mind that although
primary responsibility for making the Code effective rests
with the students, faculty cooperation is essential, since the
faculty sets the academic requirements which students are to
meet. The faculty should endeavor to avoid academic require
ments and procedures which place honorable and conscien
tious students at a disadvantage. The faculty should also be
ready and willing to consult with students and should be
responsive to their suggestions in these matters.
2. Specific Interpretations and Applications
a. Third-party responsibility: A primary responsibility
assumed by students is to discourage violations of the Honor
Code by others. Various methods are possible. Drawing
attention to a suspected violation may stop it. Moral suasion
may be effective. Initiating formal procedures is a necessary
and obligatory remedy when other methods are inappropriate
01 have failed Faculty members have like responsibilities
when suspected violations come to their attention.
b. "Proctoring": Proctoring means being present in the
examination room for the purpose of preventing dishonesty.
The prohibition against proctoring should not be construed
to prohibit the instructor from visiting the examination room
briefly to answer questions or to make announcements (e.g.,
about the time remaining for completion). Nor does it
prohibit the instructor from visiting the examination room in
response to specific prior reports from students that cheating
has been observed to investigate the basis for such reports.
c. Unusual and unreasonable precautions".' In inter
preting and applying this provision, consideration should be
given to standard procedures which are customary at Stan
ford and the need for cooperation between students and
faculty in making the Honor Code effective. The following
situations are cited as examples
An instructor should not require students to identify
themselves before fieing admitted to an examination room, or
require students to submit in advance to being searched for

notes or other materials, or maintain surveillance upon
students who leave the examination room. Nor should the
instructor take deliberate steps to invite dishonesty in ordei
to entrap students. Procedures of this kind would be unusual
and unreasonable.
On the other hand, an instructor may requite copies of an
examination or test to be returned after the examination.
When possible, alternate seating should be provided and used
for all examinations. To avoid controversy in any rereading
or regrading of students' work, the instructor may take
measures by which the original work may be clearly identi
fied. An instructor who requites students to make up a
missed test or examination may administer a different test or
examination of equivalent range and difficulty. Such proce
dures are not to be construed as unusual or unreasonable.
d. "Procedures that create temptations to violate the
Honor Code": Although students are expected to resit
temptations to cheat, the faculty should endeavor to mini
mise inducements to dishonesty.
Examples of undesirable procedures include the follow
ing: failure to give clear directions and instructions con
cerning course requirements; treating required work casually
as if it were unimportant; carelessness or inconsistency in
maintaining security of examinations or tests; reusing an
examination which is neither kept secute from public expo
sure nor made available to all students. If take-home exami
nations are given, they should not be closed-book examina
tions, nor should there be a specified time limit less than the
full period between the distribution of the examination and
its due date. Such procedures place honorable and consci
entious students in a difficult position and often at a
disadvantage.
e. Penalty grading: Under the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, students are not to be penalized for violations of the
Honor Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as
therein provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a
student's grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence
of such formal proceedings unless the student is informed
and gives consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty
may, with :he student's consent, request that the work be
redone and resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted
work.
112. Taxing tests outside the examination room: Provided
that alternate seats are available, tests will be taken from the
classroom only with the consent of the instructor. (Adopted
by student referendum as an addition to the Honor Code in
1955.)
