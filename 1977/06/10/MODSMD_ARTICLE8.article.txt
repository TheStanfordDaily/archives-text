## Grad life: 'brutalizing' or 'refreshing'? 
### Sue Lesjak 
So you're graduating, eh? Are
you ready to leave the ivory
tower and venture into the
jungle? Or have you decided to
procrastinate before making that
final leap by going to grad
school? If you've joined the lat
ter group, these remarks by grad
students should help you pre
pare for the joys and frustrations
ahead.
The "universal grad student"
doesn't exist. Experiences differ
from university to university,
academic school to academic
school, and individual to indi
vidual. Certain grad life aspects
seem to be common though.
By definition, graduate educa
tion teaches students to
specialize in one subject area
while the undergraduate educa
tion is geared to more general
study, exposing the student to
many areas of knowledge.
David Margolick, a third-year
law student, found the change
from undergrad to grad life
"phenomenal."
"I was flabbergasted at how
narrow my own orbit was. The
parameters of your whole being
shrink fantastically. People in
grad school define their goals
more narrowly. It's not the
smorgasbord that you get as an
undergrad."
"The decision to enter grad
school represents a first step to
ward a career and carries a sense
of great responsibility," said
Peter Brooks, a first year grad
student in mathematics.
"It's a shock for most people
when they go to grad school,"
claims DanaGioia, a second-year
business student. "It's designed
to be a bleak time — the purpose
is to transform you from a jerk
with wide interests intoa profes
sional."
Most of the grads interviewed
agreed with Margolick that grad
school is "a quantum leap up in
intensity and commitment. It's a
difficult place to vacillate in,"
Convictions
"As a grad student, you have
to have the conviction you're
sure what you want to do and
throw yourself into it," said
Gioia. "You have to spend the
majority of your time in your
area. If you're not sure you want
to be in grad school, you'll have a
miserable time.
"Teachers are less sympathetic
to anyone having an identity
crisis," Gioia remarked. "Their

feeling is that if you have any
doubts, you shouldn't be there.
"The biggest problem facing
grad students is doubt. Grad stu
dents are always asking them
selves: Did I do the right
thing?' " said English Prof. Rob
Polhemus.
"As an undergraduate you
don't make a fatal commitment.
Grad students are committed yet
they don't have the money or the
sway (decision-making power)
of a profession," Polhemus ad
ded.
"People often define their
whole undergraduate experi
ence in terms of graduate school
without thinking about the
commitment itself," claimed
Margolick.

"It's a shock for most people when they go to grad school. It's
designed to be a bleak time — the purpose is to transform you from
a jerk with wide interests into a professional... as a grad student,
you have to have the conviction you're sure what you want to do
and throw yourself into it. If you're not sure you want to be in grad
school, you'll have a miserable time."

For some, the "best thing
about law school is getting in,
and it's downhill afterwards. A
lot of people feel law school will
answer all their problems; it is
the path of least resistance."
'Sublimate'
"People with strong interests
in other fields, however, may
have a hard time. You have to
sublimate yourself to something
you may not care as much about.
It's right for a lot of people. But
when it's wrong, it's wrong."
Brooks enjoys focusing on one
area of study. "In part, it's a
sense of being allowed to do
what you want to do with fewer
distractions. You finally have
the chance to devote yourself to
something.
Robin Staffin, a fourth year
graduate student in physics, also
appreciates the opportunity to
specialize. Staffin said he had no
adjustment problem as a grad
student. "1 was dying to do some
research."
A physics grad student spends
most of his time working with
his adviser. "Your adviser may
suggest a problem then you in
vestigate it to see where it
leads."
Although physics grads do
take some classes, most of their
work is individual. You have to
draw moral support from your
self to a much greater extent. The
problem you're working on has
never been done.
Working on my own project is
I

much more exciting and relev
ant. I have a greater appetite for
learning.
"The urge to understand na
ture is a very overpowering
thing. It's hard to convey, but
there's a kind of poetry about se
eing nature on a deeper level.
What could be a more human
experience than seeing the un
derlying beauty of the unive
seaB"
As an undergraduate, "things
are well-defined. You have
books to read and problems to
do," explained Staffin. "A
graduate student working on a
problem has a different experi
ence. The hardest thing is to
formulate the right question.
This is much more difficult but

it's also more exciting.
Relevant to world
"The solution to your problem
is relevant to the world. I believe
physics is the real world, not just
an algebraic exercise."
Staffin explained that the
work he is doing is very similar
to what he would do as a profes
sional research associate. A grad
student in physics is much
closer to being a professional
than a student, according to Staf
fin.
The graduate program in En
glish, in contrast, "is still
school," commented Patty Ruth,
a fourth year English grad. Your
first two years are spent taking
courses, teaching and being a
TA. After that, you develop an
area of specialization, prepare
for your oral exam and begin
work on your dissertation.
Students in most other
academic fields follow a similar
program of studies. Although
undergrads and grads in
academic fields both take
courses, grad courses are much
smaller and are usually
discussion-oriented.
"I probably learn more from a
graduate seminar," said Prof.
Polhemus. During discusssions,
students find new ideas bounc
ing off of each other.
In law school, there is also
more exchange between stu
dents and professors, said Prof.
John Kaplan, who teaches both
undergrads and grads "Law

students have got to be thinking
all the time. I ask them questions
and we are constantly discus
sing issues." He explained that
this is a grave difference from a
large lecture class an undergrad
might have to take. "I demand
that my law students speak."
According to Kaplan, "Law
students are a little more tired
than undergradutes. Law school
is more demanding."
"The teaching method is diffe
rent in law school," Kaplan
said. "We focus on little prob
lems and go into them in greater
depth. Undergraduates study
broader problems and go into
them in a necessarily more sup
erficial manner."
"In law school you discuss

minor points and there is no
answer to your questions. We
don't even pretend there are
answers any more," said Mar
golick "There is a lot of knit
picking. You'll often spend 50
minutes discussing tiny points.
At first, it's exasperating that
there are no answers. Eventu
ally, you realize that law school
is more process-oriented. You
discuss finding pathways, rather
than answers to problems."
Margolick contended that there
are few scholars in law school.
"Most law students are not
motivated by a true love of the
material, but look on it as a tool
towards their professional goal."
"The way the curriculum is
designed, it's very hard to love
it,"he commented. "Most
people go in as a three year trial
to put up with."
Biz school's pragmatic
Gioia is more positive about
business school. Business stu
dents also study cases but dis
cussions are very pragmatic.
"You are given practical prob
lems to solve which is refreshing
compared to a theory or textbook
course," he said.
He compares business school
to reading Time magazine for
two years. "You get little
snatches of everything and it's
rarely boring. Business school
trains you to be a generalist
while every other grad school
trains you to be a specialist."
Another biz student described

his experience somewhat diffe
rently. He said it was like "eating
beans three meals a day for two
years."
"Grades matter a great deal in
law school," said Margolick.
"The first thing employers look
at are your grades. I don't think
personal charm will compensate
for a bad transcript."
In business school, on the
other hand, "grades really don't
matter at all," said Gioia. The
school operates on a type of
pass/fail system. The business
school makes it next to impossi
ble for an employer to see your
transcript (probably because
they don't feel there's any corre
lation between how well you do
in business school with your fu
ture capability as a businessman,
Gioia explained.
"I've interviewed with 40
companies," he added, "and no
one has ever asked to see my
transcript."
Because of the biz school's
de-emphasis on grades, the at
mosphere is not competitive at
all. Gioia said that other business
schools encouraged nastiness
among students and a cut-throat
attitude. Here, "students tend to
help each other. Most of the
work is done in teams which
forces you to learn to work with
both very nice and very awful
people. It is a really supportive
school — even more so than as
an undergraduate."
Although law school is gener
ally considered more competi
tive than biz school, Stanford's

Prof says:

. . students have got to be thinking all the time. I ask them
questions and we are constantly discussing issues. I demand that
my . . . students speak. Students are a little more tired than under
graduates . . . we focus on little problems and go into them in
greater depth."

law school is not like the Paper
Chase, said Margolick"lt's much
more relaxed. As individuals
law students are typically gentle
and nice — there aren't too many
hard-ass or cutthroat types. Of
course, you're dealing with the
cream of the crop — these law
students were all stars from
other schools. But as law schools
go, it's very friendly."
Loneliness
One of the problems facing
graduate students is the diffi
culty of meeting students out
side their discipline. "Grad stu
dents usually live in an apart

ment off campus and you tend to
meet the same people in all your
classes," explained Gioia, the
business student.
"It's a common complaint of
the men in business school that
they are very, very lonely and
can't meet women." (This is due
to the disproportionate number
of men in biz school). "Some
men in biz school spend half
their time in public places leer
ing at women," Gioia quipped.
The business school, itself has
one of the healthiest social prog
rams because the married
couples tend to organize social
get-togethers, according to
Gioia. "The trouble is that the
social life is completely centered
around the business school.
You 're sort of trapped — 1 ike in a
company town.
"Biz school is completely
self-contained. It has its own lib
rary and cafeteria and is cut-off
from the rest of the school in its
physical location.
According to Patty Ruth, En
glish grad student, the English
department also has an active
social program but "since it's a
small department, there aren't
enough people to restrict your
social life to — especially if
you're an unattached student."
Margolick said law students
also have a hard time meeting
others. "I miss terribly meeting
grad students from other de
partments. I feel that it has hurt
my growth as an individual.
"I tried meeting people at or
ganized functions more in my

first year. But the situation just
isn't nat.-iral or spontaneous.
When they corral students
and put punch glasses in your
hands, it doesn't work."
Grad students may not
socialize as much because they
don't have the time, ventured
math grad Brooks. "A greater
proportion of time is spent doing
your work. But you spend a lot of
time because you like to do it,"
he added.
The pressure isn't external but
internal, he explained. "You're
more on your own."
In law school and business

graduate or a professional. There
is too much pressure for a grad
student to prove himself and not
much glamour or money.
Biz Prof. Bob Simoni did not
think being a graduate student
was so bad. "There are different
frustrations facing grad stu
dents, but no more than those
facing undergrads," he con
tended. "There are always hur
dles to jump — that's life."
Perhaps this grad student said
it."The experience of being a
grad student is not something
you can articulate — it's just a
feeling in your gut."

school there is more external
pressure. According to Gioia, "if
you did all the work that was
assigned in biz school, you'd be
working all the time. The secret
of business school is learning to
do the work selectively. You
don't have to go to all the classes,
or to all the readings. It's even
possible to rush projects — you
can basically choose to do most
of your work in areas that in
terest you.
"The first two quarters they
work the fuck out of you but after
that it's not too hard. I am sure
I've abused the system at Stan
ford as much as anyone," Gioia
added.
"The first year is the worst
year" in law school too, accord
ing to Margolick. "At the begin
ning of law school I spent about
the same amount of time work
ing as I did as an undergraduate.
The last couple of years I didn't
work nearly as hard as I did as an
undergraduate — in third year
you probably don't work as
much."
The other grad students inter
viewed worked varying amounts
— some harder, some not as hard
as they had as undergraduates. It
seems that work time varies
more from one individual to the
next than from one school to
another.
Adjectives applied to grad life
include: 'brutalizing," "excit
ing," "tiring," "refreshing" and
"sobering."

Convictions
"As a grad student, you have
to have the conviction you're
sure what you want to do and
throw yourself into it," said
Gioia. "You have to spend the
majority of your time in your
area. If you're not sure you want
to be in grad school, you'll have a

"Teachers are less sympathetic
to anyone having an identity

feeling is that if you have any
doubts, you shouldn't be there.
"The biggest problem facing
grad students is doubt. Grad stu
dents are always asking them
selves: Did I do the right
thing?' " said English Prof. Rob
Polhemus.
"As an undergraduate you
don't make a fatal commitment.
Grad students are committed yet
they don't have the money or the
sway (decision-making power)
of a profession," Polhemus ad
ded.
"People often define their
whole undergraduate experi

"It's a shock for most people when they go to grad school. It's

For some, the "best thing
about law school is getting in,
and it's downhill afterwards. A
lot of people feel law school will
answer all their problems; it is
the path of least resistance."
'Sublimate'
"People with strong interests
in other fields, however, may
have a hard time. You have to
sublimate yourself to something
you may not care as much about.
It's right for a lot of people. But
when it's wrong, it's wrong."
Brooks enjoys focusing on one
area of study. "In part, it's a
sense of being allowed to do
what you want to do with fewer
distractions. You finally have
the chance to devote yourself to
something.
Robin Staffin, a fourth year
graduate student in physics, also
appreciates the opportunity to
specialize. Staffin said he had no
adjustment problem as a grad
student. "1 was dying to do some
research."
A physics grad student spends
most of his time working with
his adviser. "Your adviser may
suggest a problem then you in
vestigate it to see where it
leads."
Although physics grads do
take some classes, most of their
work is individual. You have to
draw moral support from your
self to a much greater extent. The
problem you're working on has
never been done.
Working on my own project is
I

much more exciting and relev
ant. I have a greater appetite for
learning.
"The urge to understand na
ture is a very overpowering
thing. It's hard to convey, but
there's a kind of poetry about se
eing nature on a deeper level.
What could be a more human
experience than seeing the un
derlying beauty of the unive
seaB"
As an undergraduate, "things
are well-defined. You have
books to read and problems to
do," explained Staffin. "A
graduate student working on a
problem has a different experi
ence. The hardest thing is to
formulate the right question.
This is much more difficult but

it's also more exciting.
Relevant to world
"The solution to your problem
is relevant to the world. I believe
physics is the real world, not just
an algebraic exercise."
Staffin explained that the
work he is doing is very similar
to what he would do as a profes
sional research associate. A grad
student in physics is much
closer to being a professional
than a student, according to Staf
fin.
The graduate program in En
glish, in contrast, "is still
school," commented Patty Ruth,
a fourth year English grad. Your
first two years are spent taking
courses, teaching and being a
TA. After that, you develop an
area of specialization, prepare
for your oral exam and begin
work on your dissertation.
Students in most other
academic fields follow a similar
program of studies. Although
undergrads and grads in
academic fields both take
courses, grad courses are much
smaller and are usually
discussion-oriented.
"I probably learn more from a
graduate seminar," said Prof.
Polhemus. During discusssions,
students find new ideas bounc
ing off of each other.
In law school, there is also
more exchange between stu
dents and professors, said Prof.
John Kaplan, who teaches both
undergrads and grads "Law

students have got to be thinking
all the time. I ask them questions
and we are constantly discus
sing issues." He explained that
this is a grave difference from a
large lecture class an undergrad
might have to take. "I demand
that my law students speak."
According to Kaplan, "Law
students are a little more tired
than undergradutes. Law school
is more demanding."
"The teaching method is diffe
rent in law school," Kaplan
said. "We focus on little prob
lems and go into them in greater
depth. Undergraduates study
broader problems and go into
them in a necessarily more sup
erficial manner."
"In law school you discuss

minor points and there is no
answer to your questions. We
don't even pretend there are
answers any more," said Mar
golick "There is a lot of knit
picking. You'll often spend 50
minutes discussing tiny points.
At first, it's exasperating that
there are no answers. Eventu
ally, you realize that law school
is more process-oriented. You
discuss finding pathways, rather
than answers to problems."
Margolick contended that there
are few scholars in law school.
"Most law students are not
motivated by a true love of the
material, but look on it as a tool
towards their professional goal."
"The way the curriculum is
designed, it's very hard to love
it,"he commented. "Most
people go in as a three year trial
to put up with."
Biz school's pragmatic
Gioia is more positive about
business school. Business stu
dents also study cases but dis
cussions are very pragmatic.
"You are given practical prob
lems to solve which is refreshing
compared to a theory or textbook
course," he said.
He compares business school
to reading Time magazine for
two years. "You get little
snatches of everything and it's
rarely boring. Business school
trains you to be a generalist
while every other grad school
trains you to be a specialist."
Another biz student described

his experience somewhat diffe
rently. He said it was like "eating
beans three meals a day for two
years."
"Grades matter a great deal in
law school," said Margolick.
"The first thing employers look
at are your grades. I don't think
personal charm will compensate
for a bad transcript."
In business school, on the
other hand, "grades really don't
matter at all," said Gioia. The
school operates on a type of
pass/fail system. The business
school makes it next to impossi
ble for an employer to see your
transcript (probably because
they don't feel there's any corre
lation between how well you do
in business school with your fu
ture capability as a businessman,
Gioia explained.
"I've interviewed with 40
companies," he added, "and no
one has ever asked to see my
transcript."
Because of the biz school's
de-emphasis on grades, the at
mosphere is not competitive at
all. Gioia said that other business
schools encouraged nastiness
among students and a cut-throat
attitude. Here, "students tend to
help each other. Most of the
work is done in teams which
forces you to learn to work with
both very nice and very awful
people. It is a really supportive
school — even more so than as
an undergraduate."
Although law school is gener
ally considered more competi
tive than biz school, Stanford's

Prof says:

. . students have got to be thinking all the time. I ask them
questions and we are constantly discussing issues. I demand that
my . . . students speak. Students are a little more tired than under
graduates . . . we focus on little problems and go into them in
greater depth."

law school is not like the Paper
Chase, said Margolick"lt's much
more relaxed. As individuals
law students are typically gentle
and nice — there aren't too many
hard-ass or cutthroat types. Of
course, you're dealing with the
cream of the crop — these law
students were all stars from
other schools. But as law schools
go, it's very friendly."
Loneliness
One of the problems facing
graduate students is the diffi
culty of meeting students out
side their discipline. "Grad stu
dents usually live in an apart

ment off campus and you tend to
meet the same people in all your
classes," explained Gioia, the
business student.
"It's a common complaint of
the men in business school that
they are very, very lonely and
can't meet women." (This is due
to the disproportionate number
of men in biz school). "Some
men in biz school spend half
their time in public places leer
ing at women," Gioia quipped.
The business school, itself has
one of the healthiest social prog
rams because the married
couples tend to organize social
get-togethers, according to
Gioia. "The trouble is that the
social life is completely centered
around the business school.
You 're sort of trapped — 1 ike in a
company town.
"Biz school is completely
self-contained. It has its own lib
rary and cafeteria and is cut-off
from the rest of the school in its
physical location.
According to Patty Ruth, En
glish grad student, the English
department also has an active
social program but "since it's a
small department, there aren't
enough people to restrict your
social life to — especially if
you're an unattached student."
Margolick said law students
also have a hard time meeting
others. "I miss terribly meeting
grad students from other de
partments. I feel that it has hurt
my growth as an individual.
"I tried meeting people at or
ganized functions more in my

first year. But the situation just
isn't nat.-iral or spontaneous.
When they corral students
and put punch glasses in your
hands, it doesn't work."
Grad students may not
socialize as much because they
don't have the time, ventured
math grad Brooks. "A greater
proportion of time is spent doing
your work. But you spend a lot of
time because you like to do it,"
he added.
The pressure isn't external but
internal, he explained. "You're
more on your own."
In law school and business

graduate or a professional. There
is too much pressure for a grad
student to prove himself and not
much glamour or money.
Biz Prof. Bob Simoni did not
think being a graduate student
was so bad. "There are different
frustrations facing grad stu
dents, but no more than those
facing undergrads," he con
tended. "There are always hur
dles to jump — that's life."
Perhaps this grad student said
it."The experience of being a
grad student is not something
you can articulate — it's just a
feeling in your gut."

school there is more external
pressure. According to Gioia, "if
you did all the work that was
assigned in biz school, you'd be
working all the time. The secret
of business school is learning to
do the work selectively. You
don't have to go to all the classes,
or to all the readings. It's even
possible to rush projects — you
can basically choose to do most
of your work in areas that in
terest you.
"The first two quarters they
work the fuck out of you but after
that it's not too hard. I am sure
I've abused the system at Stan
ford as much as anyone," Gioia
added.
"The first year is the worst
year" in law school too, accord
ing to Margolick. "At the begin
ning of law school I spent about
the same amount of time work
ing as I did as an undergraduate.
The last couple of years I didn't
work nearly as hard as I did as an
undergraduate — in third year
you probably don't work as
much."
The other grad students inter
viewed worked varying amounts
— some harder, some not as hard
as they had as undergraduates. It
seems that work time varies
more from one individual to the
next than from one school to
another.
Adjectives applied to grad life
include: 'brutalizing," "excit
ing," "tiring," "refreshing" and
"sobering."
According to Prof. Polhemus,
it's worse than being an under-
So you're graduating, eh? Are
you ready to leave the ivory
tower and venture into the
jungle? Or have you decided to
procrastinate before making that
final leap by going to grad
school? If you've joined the lat
ter group, these remarks by grad
students should help you pre
pare for the joys and frustrations
ahead.
The "universal grad student"
doesn't exist. Experiences differ
from university to university,
academic school to academic
school, and individual to indi
vidual. Certain grad life aspects
seem to be common though.
By definition, graduate educa
tion teaches students to
specialize in one subject area
while the undergraduate educa
tion is geared to more general
study, exposing the student to
many areas of knowledge.
David Margolick, a third-year
law student, found the change
from undergrad to grad life
"phenomenal."
"I was flabbergasted at how
narrow my own orbit was. The
parameters of your whole being
shrink fantastically. People in
grad school define their goals
more narrowly. It's not the
smorgasbord that you get as an
undergrad."
"The decision to enter grad
school represents a first step to
ward a career and carries a sense
of great responsibility," said
Peter Brooks, a first year grad
student in mathematics.
"It's a shock for most people

the path of least resistance."
'Sublimate'
"People with strong interests
in other fields, however, may
have a hard time. You have to
sublimate yourself to something
you may not care as much about.
It's right for a lot of people. But
when it's wrong, it's wrong."
Brooks enjoys focusing on one
area of study. "In part, it's a
sense of being allowed to do
what you want to do with fewer
distractions. You finally have
the chance to devote yourself to
something.
Robin Staffin, a fourth year
graduate student in physics, also
appreciates the opportunity to
specialize. Staffin said he had no
adjustment problem as a grad
student. "1 was dying to do some
research."
A physics grad student spends
most of his time working with
his adviser. "Your adviser may
suggest a problem then you in
vestigate it to see where it
leads."
Although physics grads do
take some classes, most of their
work is individual. You have to
draw moral support from your
self to a much greater extent. The
problem you're working on has
never been done.
Working on my own project is
I

much more exciting and relev
ant. I have a greater appetite for
learning.
"The urge to understand na
ture is a very overpowering
thing. It's hard to convey, but
there's a kind of poetry about se
eing nature on a deeper level.
What could be a more human
experience than seeing the un
derlying beauty of the unive
seaB"
As an undergraduate, "things
are well-defined. You have
books to read and problems to
do," explained Staffin. "A
graduate student working on a
problem has a different experi
ence. The hardest thing is to
formulate the right question.
This is much more difficult but

it's also more exciting.
Relevant to world
"The solution to your problem
is relevant to the world. I believe
physics is the real world, not just
an algebraic exercise."
Staffin explained that the
work he is doing is very similar
to what he would do as a profes
sional research associate. A grad
student in physics is much
closer to being a professional
than a student, according to Staf
fin.
The graduate program in En
glish, in contrast, "is still
school," commented Patty Ruth,
a fourth year English grad. Your
first two years are spent taking
courses, teaching and being a
TA. After that, you develop an
area of specialization, prepare
for your oral exam and begin
work on your dissertation.
Students in most other
academic fields follow a similar
program of studies. Although
undergrads and grads in
academic fields both take
courses, grad courses are much
smaller and are usually
discussion-oriented.
"I probably learn more from a
graduate seminar," said Prof.
Polhemus. During discusssions,
students find new ideas bounc
ing off of each other.
In law school, there is also
more exchange between stu
dents and professors, said Prof.
John Kaplan, who teaches both
undergrads and grads "Law

students have got to be thinking
all the time. I ask them questions
and we are constantly discus
sing issues." He explained that
this is a grave difference from a
large lecture class an undergrad
might have to take. "I demand
that my law students speak."
According to Kaplan, "Law
students are a little more tired
than undergradutes. Law school
is more demanding."
"The teaching method is diffe
rent in law school," Kaplan
said. "We focus on little prob
lems and go into them in greater
depth. Undergraduates study
broader problems and go into
them in a necessarily more sup
erficial manner."
"In law school you discuss

minor points and there is no
answer to your questions. We
don't even pretend there are
answers any more," said Mar
golick "There is a lot of knit
picking. You'll often spend 50
minutes discussing tiny points.
At first, it's exasperating that
there are no answers. Eventu
ally, you realize that law school
is more process-oriented. You
discuss finding pathways, rather
than answers to problems."
Margolick contended that there
are few scholars in law school.
"Most law students are not
motivated by a true love of the
material, but look on it as a tool
towards their professional goal."
"The way the curriculum is
designed, it's very hard to love
it,"he commented. "Most
people go in as a three year trial
to put up with."
Biz school's pragmatic
Gioia is more positive about
business school. Business stu
dents also study cases but dis
cussions are very pragmatic.
"You are given practical prob
lems to solve which is refreshing
compared to a theory or textbook
course," he said.
He compares business school
to reading Time magazine for
two years. "You get little
snatches of everything and it's
rarely boring. Business school
trains you to be a generalist
while every other grad school
trains you to be a specialist."
Another biz student described

his experience somewhat diffe
rently. He said it was like "eating
beans three meals a day for two
years."
"Grades matter a great deal in
law school," said Margolick.
"The first thing employers look
at are your grades. I don't think
personal charm will compensate
for a bad transcript."
In business school, on the
other hand, "grades really don't
matter at all," said Gioia. The
school operates on a type of
pass/fail system. The business
school makes it next to impossi
ble for an employer to see your
transcript (probably because
they don't feel there's any corre
lation between how well you do
in business school with your fu
ture capability as a businessman,
Gioia explained.
"I've interviewed with 40
companies," he added, "and no
one has ever asked to see my
transcript."
Because of the biz school's
de-emphasis on grades, the at
mosphere is not competitive at
all. Gioia said that other business
schools encouraged nastiness
among students and a cut-throat
attitude. Here, "students tend to
help each other. Most of the
work is done in teams which
forces you to learn to work with
both very nice and very awful
people. It is a really supportive
school — even more so than as
an undergraduate."
Although law school is gener
ally considered more competi
tive than biz school, Stanford's

Prof says:

. . students have got to be thinking all the time. I ask them
questions and we are constantly discussing issues. I demand that
my . . . students speak. Students are a little more tired than under
graduates . . . we focus on little problems and go into them in
greater depth."

law school is not like the Paper
Chase, said Margolick"lt's much
more relaxed. As individuals
law students are typically gentle
and nice — there aren't too many
hard-ass or cutthroat types. Of
course, you're dealing with the
cream of the crop — these law
students were all stars from
other schools. But as law schools
go, it's very friendly."
Loneliness
One of the problems facing
graduate students is the diffi
culty of meeting students out
side their discipline. "Grad stu
dents usually live in an apart

ment off campus and you tend to
meet the same people in all your
classes," explained Gioia, the
business student.
"It's a common complaint of
the men in business school that
they are very, very lonely and
can't meet women." (This is due
to the disproportionate number
of men in biz school). "Some
men in biz school spend half
their time in public places leer
ing at women," Gioia quipped.
The business school, itself has
one of the healthiest social prog
rams because the married
couples tend to organize social
get-togethers, according to
Gioia. "The trouble is that the
social life is completely centered
around the business school.
You 're sort of trapped — 1 ike in a
company town.
"Biz school is completely
self-contained. It has its own lib
rary and cafeteria and is cut-off
from the rest of the school in its
physical location.
According to Patty Ruth, En
glish grad student, the English
department also has an active
social program but "since it's a
small department, there aren't
enough people to restrict your
social life to — especially if
you're an unattached student."
Margolick said law students
also have a hard time meeting
others. "I miss terribly meeting
grad students from other de
partments. I feel that it has hurt
my growth as an individual.
"I tried meeting people at or
ganized functions more in my

first year. But the situation just
isn't nat.-iral or spontaneous.
When they corral students
and put punch glasses in your
hands, it doesn't work."
Grad students may not
socialize as much because they
don't have the time, ventured
math grad Brooks. "A greater
proportion of time is spent doing
your work. But you spend a lot of
time because you like to do it,"
he added.
The pressure isn't external but
internal, he explained. "You're
more on your own."
In law school and business

graduate or a professional. There
is too much pressure for a grad
student to prove himself and not
much glamour or money.
Biz Prof. Bob Simoni did not
think being a graduate student
was so bad. "There are different
frustrations facing grad stu
dents, but no more than those
facing undergrads," he con
tended. "There are always hur
dles to jump — that's life."
Perhaps this grad student said
it."The experience of being a
grad student is not something
you can articulate — it's just a
feeling in your gut."

school there is more external
pressure. According to Gioia, "if
you did all the work that was
assigned in biz school, you'd be
working all the time. The secret
of business school is learning to
do the work selectively. You
don't have to go to all the classes,
or to all the readings. It's even
possible to rush projects — you
can basically choose to do most
of your work in areas that in
terest you.
"The first two quarters they
work the fuck out of you but after
that it's not too hard. I am sure
I've abused the system at Stan
ford as much as anyone," Gioia
added.
"The first year is the worst
year" in law school too, accord
ing to Margolick. "At the begin
ning of law school I spent about
the same amount of time work
ing as I did as an undergraduate.
The last couple of years I didn't
work nearly as hard as I did as an
undergraduate — in third year
you probably don't work as
much."
The other grad students inter
viewed worked varying amounts
— some harder, some not as hard
as they had as undergraduates. It
seems that work time varies
more from one individual to the
next than from one school to
another.
Adjectives applied to grad life
include: 'brutalizing," "excit
ing," "tiring," "refreshing" and
"sobering."
According to Prof. Polhemus,
it's worse than being an under-
So you're graduating, eh? Are
you ready to leave the ivory
tower and venture into the
jungle? Or have you decided to
procrastinate before making that
final leap by going to grad
school? If you've joined the lat
ter group, these remarks by grad
students should help you pre
pare for the joys and frustrations
ahead.
The "universal grad student"
doesn't exist. Experiences differ
from university to university,
academic school to academic
school, and individual to indi
vidual. Certain grad life aspects
seem to be common though.
By definition, graduate educa
tion teaches students to
specialize in one subject area
while the undergraduate educa
tion is geared to more general
study, exposing the student to
many areas of knowledge.
David Margolick, a third-year
law student, found the change
from undergrad to grad life
"phenomenal."
"I was flabbergasted at how
narrow my own orbit was. The
parameters of your whole being
shrink fantastically. People in
grad school define their goals
more narrowly. It's not the
smorgasbord that you get as an
undergrad."
"The decision to enter grad
school represents a first step to
ward a career and carries a sense
of great responsibility," said
Peter Brooks, a first year grad
student in mathematics.
"It's a shock for most people
when they go to grad school,"
claims DanaGioia, a second-year
business student. "It's designed
to be a bleak time — the purpose
is to transform you from a jerk
with wide interests intoa profes
sional."
Most of the grads interviewed
agreed with Margolick that grad
school is "a quantum leap up in
intensity and commitment. It's a
difficult place to vacillate in,"
Convictions
"As a grad student, you have
to have the conviction you're
sure what you want to do and
throw yourself into it," said
Gioia. "You have to spend the
majority of your time in your
area. If you're not sure you want
to be in grad school, you'll have a
miserable time.
"Teachers are less sympathetic
to anyone having an identity
crisis," Gioia remarked. "Their

feeling is that if you have any
doubts, you shouldn't be there.
"The biggest problem facing
grad students is doubt. Grad stu
dents are always asking them
selves: Did I do the right
thing?' " said English Prof. Rob
Polhemus.
"As an undergraduate you
don't make a fatal commitment.
Grad students are committed yet
they don't have the money or the
sway (decision-making power)
of a profession," Polhemus ad
ded.
"People often define their
whole undergraduate experi
ence in terms of graduate school
without thinking about the
commitment itself," claimed
Margolick.

problem has a different experi
ence. The hardest thing is to
formulate the right question.
This is much more difficult but

it's also more exciting.
Relevant to world
"The solution to your problem
is relevant to the world. I believe
physics is the real world, not just
an algebraic exercise."
Staffin explained that the
work he is doing is very similar
to what he would do as a profes
sional research associate. A grad
student in physics is much
closer to being a professional
than a student, according to Staf
fin.
The graduate program in En
glish, in contrast, "is still
school," commented Patty Ruth,
a fourth year English grad. Your
first two years are spent taking
courses, teaching and being a
TA. After that, you develop an
area of specialization, prepare
for your oral exam and begin
work on your dissertation.
Students in most other
academic fields follow a similar
program of studies. Although
undergrads and grads in
academic fields both take
courses, grad courses are much
smaller and are usually
discussion-oriented.
"I probably learn more from a
graduate seminar," said Prof.
Polhemus. During discusssions,
students find new ideas bounc
ing off of each other.
In law school, there is also
more exchange between stu
dents and professors, said Prof.
John Kaplan, who teaches both
undergrads and grads "Law

students have got to be thinking
all the time. I ask them questions
and we are constantly discus
sing issues." He explained that
this is a grave difference from a
large lecture class an undergrad
might have to take. "I demand
that my law students speak."
According to Kaplan, "Law
students are a little more tired
than undergradutes. Law school
is more demanding."
"The teaching method is diffe
rent in law school," Kaplan
said. "We focus on little prob
lems and go into them in greater
depth. Undergraduates study
broader problems and go into
them in a necessarily more sup
erficial manner."
"In law school you discuss

minor points and there is no
answer to your questions. We
don't even pretend there are
answers any more," said Mar
golick "There is a lot of knit
picking. You'll often spend 50
minutes discussing tiny points.
At first, it's exasperating that
there are no answers. Eventu
ally, you realize that law school
is more process-oriented. You
discuss finding pathways, rather
than answers to problems."
Margolick contended that there
are few scholars in law school.
"Most law students are not
motivated by a true love of the
material, but look on it as a tool
towards their professional goal."
"The way the curriculum is
designed, it's very hard to love
it,"he commented. "Most
people go in as a three year trial
to put up with."
Biz school's pragmatic
Gioia is more positive about
business school. Business stu
dents also study cases but dis
cussions are very pragmatic.
"You are given practical prob
lems to solve which is refreshing
compared to a theory or textbook
course," he said.
He compares business school
to reading Time magazine for
two years. "You get little
snatches of everything and it's
rarely boring. Business school
trains you to be a generalist
while every other grad school
trains you to be a specialist."
Another biz student described

his experience somewhat diffe
rently. He said it was like "eating
beans three meals a day for two
years."
"Grades matter a great deal in
law school," said Margolick.
"The first thing employers look
at are your grades. I don't think
personal charm will compensate
for a bad transcript."
In business school, on the
other hand, "grades really don't
matter at all," said Gioia. The
school operates on a type of
pass/fail system. The business
school makes it next to impossi
ble for an employer to see your
transcript (probably because
they don't feel there's any corre
lation between how well you do
in business school with your fu
ture capability as a businessman,
Gioia explained.
"I've interviewed with 40
companies," he added, "and no
one has ever asked to see my
transcript."
Because of the biz school's
de-emphasis on grades, the at
mosphere is not competitive at
all. Gioia said that other business
schools encouraged nastiness
among students and a cut-throat
attitude. Here, "students tend to
help each other. Most of the
work is done in teams which
forces you to learn to work with
both very nice and very awful
people. It is a really supportive
school — even more so than as
an undergraduate."
Although law school is gener
ally considered more competi
tive than biz school, Stanford's

Prof says:

. . students have got to be thinking all the time. I ask them
questions and we are constantly discussing issues. I demand that
my . . . students speak. Students are a little more tired than under
graduates . . . we focus on little problems and go into them in
greater depth."

law school is not like the Paper
Chase, said Margolick"lt's much
more relaxed. As individuals
law students are typically gentle
and nice — there aren't too many
hard-ass or cutthroat types. Of
course, you're dealing with the
cream of the crop — these law
students were all stars from
other schools. But as law schools
go, it's very friendly."
Loneliness
One of the problems facing
graduate students is the diffi
culty of meeting students out
side their discipline. "Grad stu
dents usually live in an apart

ment off campus and you tend to
meet the same people in all your
classes," explained Gioia, the
business student.
"It's a common complaint of
the men in business school that
they are very, very lonely and
can't meet women." (This is due
to the disproportionate number
of men in biz school). "Some
men in biz school spend half
their time in public places leer
ing at women," Gioia quipped.
The business school, itself has
one of the healthiest social prog
rams because the married
couples tend to organize social
get-togethers, according to
Gioia. "The trouble is that the
social life is completely centered
around the business school.
You 're sort of trapped — 1 ike in a
company town.
"Biz school is completely
self-contained. It has its own lib
rary and cafeteria and is cut-off
from the rest of the school in its
physical location.
According to Patty Ruth, En
glish grad student, the English
department also has an active
social program but "since it's a
small department, there aren't
enough people to restrict your
social life to — especially if
you're an unattached student."
Margolick said law students
also have a hard time meeting
others. "I miss terribly meeting
grad students from other de
partments. I feel that it has hurt
my growth as an individual.
"I tried meeting people at or
ganized functions more in my

first year. But the situation just
isn't nat.-iral or spontaneous.
When they corral students
and put punch glasses in your
hands, it doesn't work."
Grad students may not
socialize as much because they
don't have the time, ventured
math grad Brooks. "A greater
proportion of time is spent doing
your work. But you spend a lot of
time because you like to do it,"
he added.
The pressure isn't external but
internal, he explained. "You're
more on your own."
In law school and business

graduate or a professional. There
is too much pressure for a grad
student to prove himself and not
much glamour or money.
Biz Prof. Bob Simoni did not
think being a graduate student
was so bad. "There are different
frustrations facing grad stu
dents, but no more than those
facing undergrads," he con
tended. "There are always hur
dles to jump — that's life."
Perhaps this grad student said
it."The experience of being a
grad student is not something
you can articulate — it's just a
feeling in your gut."

school there is more external
pressure. According to Gioia, "if
you did all the work that was
assigned in biz school, you'd be
working all the time. The secret
of business school is learning to
do the work selectively. You
don't have to go to all the classes,
or to all the readings. It's even
possible to rush projects — you
can basically choose to do most
of your work in areas that in
terest you.
"The first two quarters they
work the fuck out of you but after
that it's not too hard. I am sure
I've abused the system at Stan
ford as much as anyone," Gioia
added.
"The first year is the worst
year" in law school too, accord
ing to Margolick. "At the begin
ning of law school I spent about
the same amount of time work
ing as I did as an undergraduate.
The last couple of years I didn't
work nearly as hard as I did as an
undergraduate — in third year
you probably don't work as
much."
The other grad students inter
viewed worked varying amounts
— some harder, some not as hard
as they had as undergraduates. It
seems that work time varies
more from one individual to the
next than from one school to
another.
Adjectives applied to grad life
include: 'brutalizing," "excit
ing," "tiring," "refreshing" and
"sobering."
According to Prof. Polhemus,
it's worse than being an under-
So you're graduating, eh? Are
you ready to leave the ivory
tower and venture into the
jungle? Or have you decided to
procrastinate before making that
final leap by going to grad
school? If you've joined the lat
ter group, these remarks by grad
students should help you pre
pare for the joys and frustrations
ahead.
The "universal grad student"
doesn't exist. Experiences differ
from university to university,
academic school to academic
school, and individual to indi
vidual. Certain grad life aspects
seem to be common though.
By definition, graduate educa
tion teaches students to
specialize in one subject area
while the undergraduate educa
tion is geared to more general
study, exposing the student to
many areas of knowledge.
David Margolick, a third-year
law student, found the change
from undergrad to grad life
"phenomenal."
"I was flabbergasted at how
narrow my own orbit was. The
parameters of your whole being
shrink fantastically. People in
grad school define their goals
more narrowly. It's not the
smorgasbord that you get as an
undergrad."
"The decision to enter grad
school represents a first step to
ward a career and carries a sense
of great responsibility," said
Peter Brooks, a first year grad
student in mathematics.
"It's a shock for most people
when they go to grad school,"
claims DanaGioia, a second-year
business student. "It's designed
to be a bleak time — the purpose
is to transform you from a jerk
with wide interests intoa profes
sional."
Most of the grads interviewed
agreed with Margolick that grad
school is "a quantum leap up in
intensity and commitment. It's a
difficult place to vacillate in,"
Convictions
"As a grad student, you have
to have the conviction you're
sure what you want to do and
throw yourself into it," said
Gioia. "You have to spend the
majority of your time in your
area. If you're not sure you want
to be in grad school, you'll have a
miserable time.
"Teachers are less sympathetic
to anyone having an identity
crisis," Gioia remarked. "Their

feeling is that if you have any
doubts, you shouldn't be there.
"The biggest problem facing
grad students is doubt. Grad stu
dents are always asking them
selves: Did I do the right
thing?' " said English Prof. Rob
Polhemus.
"As an undergraduate you
don't make a fatal commitment.
Grad students are committed yet
they don't have the money or the
sway (decision-making power)
of a profession," Polhemus ad
ded.
"People often define their
whole undergraduate experi
ence in terms of graduate school
without thinking about the
commitment itself," claimed
Margolick.

Student says:

"It's a shock for most people when they go to grad school. It's
designed to be a bleak time — the purpose is to transform you from
a jerk with wide interests into a professional... as a grad student,

and throw yourself into it. If you're not sure you want to be in grad
school, you'll have a miserable time."

For some, the "best thing
about law school is getting in,
and it's downhill afterwards. A
lot of people feel law school will
answer all their problems; it is
the path of least resistance."
'Sublimate'
"People with strong interests
in other fields, however, may
have a hard time. You have to
sublimate yourself to something
you may not care as much about.
It's right for a lot of people. But
when it's wrong, it's wrong."
Brooks enjoys focusing on one
area of study. "In part, it's a
sense of being allowed to do
what you want to do with fewer
distractions. You finally have
the chance to devote yourself to
something.
Robin Staffin, a fourth year
graduate student in physics, also
appreciates the opportunity to
specialize. Staffin said he had no
adjustment problem as a grad
student. "1 was dying to do some
research."
A physics grad student spends
most of his time working with
his adviser. "Your adviser may
suggest a problem then you in
vestigate it to see where it
leads."
Although physics grads do
take some classes, most of their
work is individual. You have to
draw moral support from your
self to a much greater extent. The
problem you're working on has
never been done.
Working on my own project is

As an undergraduate, "things

is more demanding."
"The teaching method is diffe
rent in law school," Kaplan
said. "We focus on little prob
lems and go into them in greater
depth. Undergraduates study
broader problems and go into
them in a necessarily more sup
erficial manner."
"In law school you discuss

minor points and there is no
answer to your questions. We
don't even pretend there are
answers any more," said Mar
golick "There is a lot of knit
picking. You'll often spend 50
minutes discussing tiny points.
At first, it's exasperating that
there are no answers. Eventu
ally, you realize that law school
is more process-oriented. You
discuss finding pathways, rather
than answers to problems."
Margolick contended that there
are few scholars in law school.
"Most law students are not
motivated by a true love of the
material, but look on it as a tool
towards their professional goal."
"The way the curriculum is
designed, it's very hard to love
it,"he commented. "Most
people go in as a three year trial
to put up with."
Biz school's pragmatic
Gioia is more positive about
business school. Business stu
dents also study cases but dis
cussions are very pragmatic.
"You are given practical prob
lems to solve which is refreshing
compared to a theory or textbook
course," he said.
He compares business school
to reading Time magazine for
two years. "You get little
snatches of everything and it's
rarely boring. Business school
trains you to be a generalist
while every other grad school
trains you to be a specialist."
Another biz student described

his experience somewhat diffe
rently. He said it was like "eating
beans three meals a day for two
years."
"Grades matter a great deal in
law school," said Margolick.
"The first thing employers look
at are your grades. I don't think
personal charm will compensate
for a bad transcript."
In business school, on the
other hand, "grades really don't
matter at all," said Gioia. The
school operates on a type of
pass/fail system. The business
school makes it next to impossi
ble for an employer to see your
transcript (probably because
they don't feel there's any corre
lation between how well you do
in business school with your fu
ture capability as a businessman,
Gioia explained.
"I've interviewed with 40
companies," he added, "and no
one has ever asked to see my
transcript."
Because of the biz school's
de-emphasis on grades, the at
mosphere is not competitive at
all. Gioia said that other business
schools encouraged nastiness
among students and a cut-throat
attitude. Here, "students tend to
help each other. Most of the
work is done in teams which
forces you to learn to work with
both very nice and very awful
people. It is a really supportive
school — even more so than as
an undergraduate."
Although law school is gener
ally considered more competi
tive than biz school, Stanford's

Prof says:

. . students have got to be thinking all the time. I ask them
questions and we are constantly discussing issues. I demand that
my . . . students speak. Students are a little more tired than under
graduates . . . we focus on little problems and go into them in
greater depth."

law school is not like the Paper
Chase, said Margolick"lt's much
more relaxed. As individuals
law students are typically gentle
and nice — there aren't too many
hard-ass or cutthroat types. Of
course, you're dealing with the
cream of the crop — these law
students were all stars from
other schools. But as law schools
go, it's very friendly."
Loneliness
One of the problems facing
graduate students is the diffi
culty of meeting students out
side their discipline. "Grad stu
dents usually live in an apart

ment off campus and you tend to
meet the same people in all your
classes," explained Gioia, the
business student.
"It's a common complaint of
the men in business school that
they are very, very lonely and
can't meet women." (This is due
to the disproportionate number
of men in biz school). "Some
men in biz school spend half
their time in public places leer
ing at women," Gioia quipped.
The business school, itself has
one of the healthiest social prog
rams because the married
couples tend to organize social
get-togethers, according to
Gioia. "The trouble is that the
social life is completely centered
around the business school.
You 're sort of trapped — 1 ike in a
company town.
"Biz school is completely
self-contained. It has its own lib
rary and cafeteria and is cut-off
from the rest of the school in its
physical location.
According to Patty Ruth, En
glish grad student, the English
department also has an active
social program but "since it's a
small department, there aren't
enough people to restrict your
social life to — especially if
you're an unattached student."
Margolick said law students
also have a hard time meeting
others. "I miss terribly meeting
grad students from other de
partments. I feel that it has hurt
my growth as an individual.
"I tried meeting people at or
ganized functions more in my

first year. But the situation just
isn't nat.-iral or spontaneous.
When they corral students
and put punch glasses in your
hands, it doesn't work."
Grad students may not
socialize as much because they
don't have the time, ventured
math grad Brooks. "A greater
proportion of time is spent doing
your work. But you spend a lot of
time because you like to do it,"
he added.
The pressure isn't external but
internal, he explained. "You're
more on your own."
In law school and business

graduate or a professional. There
is too much pressure for a grad
student to prove himself and not
much glamour or money.
Biz Prof. Bob Simoni did not
think being a graduate student
was so bad. "There are different
frustrations facing grad stu
dents, but no more than those
facing undergrads," he con
tended. "There are always hur
dles to jump — that's life."
Perhaps this grad student said
it."The experience of being a
grad student is not something
you can articulate — it's just a
feeling in your gut."

school there is more external
pressure. According to Gioia, "if
you did all the work that was
assigned in biz school, you'd be
working all the time. The secret
of business school is learning to
do the work selectively. You
don't have to go to all the classes,
or to all the readings. It's even
possible to rush projects — you
can basically choose to do most
of your work in areas that in
terest you.
"The first two quarters they
work the fuck out of you but after
that it's not too hard. I am sure
I've abused the system at Stan
ford as much as anyone," Gioia
added.
"The first year is the worst
year" in law school too, accord
ing to Margolick. "At the begin
ning of law school I spent about
the same amount of time work
ing as I did as an undergraduate.
The last couple of years I didn't
work nearly as hard as I did as an
undergraduate — in third year
you probably don't work as
much."
The other grad students inter
viewed worked varying amounts
— some harder, some not as hard
as they had as undergraduates. It
seems that work time varies
more from one individual to the
next than from one school to
another.
Adjectives applied to grad life
include: 'brutalizing," "excit
ing," "tiring," "refreshing" and
"sobering."
According to Prof. Polhemus,
it's worse than being an under-
So you're graduating, eh? Are
you ready to leave the ivory
tower and venture into the
jungle? Or have you decided to
procrastinate before making that
final leap by going to grad
school? If you've joined the lat
ter group, these remarks by grad
students should help you pre
pare for the joys and frustrations
ahead.
The "universal grad student"
doesn't exist. Experiences differ
from university to university,
academic school to academic
school, and individual to indi
vidual. Certain grad life aspects
seem to be common though.
By definition, graduate educa
tion teaches students to
specialize in one subject area
while the undergraduate educa
tion is geared to more general
study, exposing the student to
many areas of knowledge.
David Margolick, a third-year
law student, found the change
from undergrad to grad life
"phenomenal."
"I was flabbergasted at how
narrow my own orbit was. The
parameters of your whole being
shrink fantastically. People in
grad school define their goals
more narrowly. It's not the
smorgasbord that you get as an
undergrad."
"The decision to enter grad
school represents a first step to
ward a career and carries a sense
of great responsibility," said
Peter Brooks, a first year grad
student in mathematics.
"It's a shock for most people
when they go to grad school,"
claims DanaGioia, a second-year
business student. "It's designed
to be a bleak time — the purpose
is to transform you from a jerk
with wide interests intoa profes
sional."
Most of the grads interviewed
agreed with Margolick that grad
school is "a quantum leap up in
intensity and commitment. It's a
difficult place to vacillate in,"
Convictions
"As a grad student, you have
to have the conviction you're
sure what you want to do and
throw yourself into it," said
Gioia. "You have to spend the
majority of your time in your
area. If you're not sure you want
to be in grad school, you'll have a
miserable time.
"Teachers are less sympathetic
to anyone having an identity
crisis," Gioia remarked. "Their

feeling is that if you have any
doubts, you shouldn't be there.
"The biggest problem facing
grad students is doubt. Grad stu
dents are always asking them
selves: Did I do the right
thing?' " said English Prof. Rob
Polhemus.
"As an undergraduate you
don't make a fatal commitment.
Grad students are committed yet
they don't have the money or the
sway (decision-making power)
of a profession," Polhemus ad
ded.
"People often define their
whole undergraduate experi
ence in terms of graduate school
without thinking about the
commitment itself," claimed
Margolick.

Student says:

"It's a shock for most people when they go to grad school. It's
designed to be a bleak time — the purpose is to transform you from
a jerk with wide interests into a professional... as a grad student,
you have to have the conviction you're sure what you want to do
and throw yourself into it. If you're not sure you want to be in grad
school, you'll have a miserable time."

For some, the "best thing
about law school is getting in,
and it's downhill afterwards. A
lot of people feel law school will
answer all their problems; it is
the path of least resistance."
'Sublimate'
"People with strong interests
in other fields, however, may
have a hard time. You have to
sublimate yourself to something
you may not care as much about.
It's right for a lot of people. But
when it's wrong, it's wrong."
Brooks enjoys focusing on one
area of study. "In part, it's a
sense of being allowed to do
what you want to do with fewer
distractions. You finally have
the chance to devote yourself to
something.
Robin Staffin, a fourth year
graduate student in physics, also
appreciates the opportunity to
specialize. Staffin said he had no
adjustment problem as a grad
student. "1 was dying to do some
research."
A physics grad student spends
most of his time working with
his adviser. "Your adviser may
suggest a problem then you in
vestigate it to see where it
leads."
Although physics grads do
take some classes, most of their
work is individual. You have to
draw moral support from your
self to a much greater extent. The
problem you're working on has
never been done.
Working on my own project is
I

much more exciting and relev
ant. I have a greater appetite for
learning.
"The urge to understand na
ture is a very overpowering
thing. It's hard to convey, but
there's a kind of poetry about se
eing nature on a deeper level.
What could be a more human
experience than seeing the un
derlying beauty of the unive
seaB"
As an undergraduate, "things
are well-defined. You have
books to read and problems to
do," explained Staffin. "A
graduate student working on a
problem has a different experi
ence. The hardest thing is to
formulate the right question.
This is much more difficult but

it's also more exciting.
Relevant to world
"The solution to your problem
is relevant to the world. I believe
physics is the real world, not just
an algebraic exercise."
Staffin explained that the
work he is doing is very similar
to what he would do as a profes
sional research associate. A grad
student in physics is much
closer to being a professional
than a student, according to Staf
fin.
The graduate program in En
glish, in contrast, "is still
school," commented Patty Ruth,
a fourth year English grad. Your
first two years are spent taking
courses, teaching and being a
TA. After that, you develop an
area of specialization, prepare
for your oral exam and begin
work on your dissertation.
Students in most other
academic fields follow a similar
program of studies. Although
undergrads and grads in
academic fields both take
courses, grad courses are much
smaller and are usually
discussion-oriented.
"I probably learn more from a
graduate seminar," said Prof.
Polhemus. During discusssions,
students find new ideas bounc
ing off of each other.
In law school, there is also
more exchange between stu
dents and professors, said Prof.
John Kaplan, who teaches both
undergrads and grads "Law

students have got to be thinking
all the time. I ask them questions
and we are constantly discus
sing issues." He explained that
this is a grave difference from a
large lecture class an undergrad
might have to take. "I demand
that my law students speak."
According to Kaplan, "Law

beans three meals a day for two
years."
"Grades matter a great deal in
law school," said Margolick.
"The first thing employers look
at are your grades. I don't think
personal charm will compensate
for a bad transcript."
In business school, on the
other hand, "grades really don't
matter at all," said Gioia. The
school operates on a type of
pass/fail system. The business
school makes it next to impossi
ble for an employer to see your
transcript (probably because
they don't feel there's any corre
lation between how well you do
in business school with your fu
ture capability as a businessman,
Gioia explained.
"I've interviewed with 40
companies," he added, "and no
one has ever asked to see my
transcript."
Because of the biz school's
de-emphasis on grades, the at
mosphere is not competitive at
all. Gioia said that other business
schools encouraged nastiness
among students and a cut-throat
attitude. Here, "students tend to
help each other. Most of the
work is done in teams which
forces you to learn to work with
both very nice and very awful
people. It is a really supportive
school — even more so than as
an undergraduate."
Although law school is gener
ally considered more competi
tive than biz school, Stanford's

Prof says:

. . students have got to be thinking all the time. I ask them
questions and we are constantly discussing issues. I demand that
my . . . students speak. Students are a little more tired than under
graduates . . . we focus on little problems and go into them in
greater depth."

law school is not like the Paper
Chase, said Margolick"lt's much
more relaxed. As individuals
law students are typically gentle
and nice — there aren't too many
hard-ass or cutthroat types. Of
course, you're dealing with the
cream of the crop — these law
students were all stars from
other schools. But as law schools
go, it's very friendly."
Loneliness
One of the problems facing
graduate students is the diffi
culty of meeting students out
side their discipline. "Grad stu
dents usually live in an apart

ment off campus and you tend to
meet the same people in all your
classes," explained Gioia, the
business student.
"It's a common complaint of
the men in business school that
they are very, very lonely and
can't meet women." (This is due
to the disproportionate number
of men in biz school). "Some
men in biz school spend half
their time in public places leer
ing at women," Gioia quipped.
The business school, itself has
one of the healthiest social prog
rams because the married
couples tend to organize social
get-togethers, according to
Gioia. "The trouble is that the
social life is completely centered
around the business school.
You 're sort of trapped — 1 ike in a
company town.
"Biz school is completely
self-contained. It has its own lib
rary and cafeteria and is cut-off
from the rest of the school in its
physical location.
According to Patty Ruth, En
glish grad student, the English
department also has an active
social program but "since it's a
small department, there aren't
enough people to restrict your
social life to — especially if
you're an unattached student."
Margolick said law students
also have a hard time meeting
others. "I miss terribly meeting
grad students from other de
partments. I feel that it has hurt
my growth as an individual.
"I tried meeting people at or
ganized functions more in my

first year. But the situation just
isn't nat.-iral or spontaneous.
When they corral students
and put punch glasses in your
hands, it doesn't work."
Grad students may not
socialize as much because they
don't have the time, ventured
math grad Brooks. "A greater
proportion of time is spent doing
your work. But you spend a lot of
time because you like to do it,"
he added.
The pressure isn't external but
internal, he explained. "You're
more on your own."
In law school and business

graduate or a professional. There
is too much pressure for a grad
student to prove himself and not
much glamour or money.
Biz Prof. Bob Simoni did not
think being a graduate student
was so bad. "There are different
frustrations facing grad stu
dents, but no more than those
facing undergrads," he con
tended. "There are always hur
dles to jump — that's life."
Perhaps this grad student said
it."The experience of being a
grad student is not something
you can articulate — it's just a
feeling in your gut."

school there is more external
pressure. According to Gioia, "if
you did all the work that was
assigned in biz school, you'd be
working all the time. The secret
of business school is learning to
do the work selectively. You
don't have to go to all the classes,
or to all the readings. It's even
possible to rush projects — you
can basically choose to do most
of your work in areas that in
terest you.
"The first two quarters they
work the fuck out of you but after
that it's not too hard. I am sure
I've abused the system at Stan
ford as much as anyone," Gioia
added.
"The first year is the worst
year" in law school too, accord
ing to Margolick. "At the begin
ning of law school I spent about
the same amount of time work
ing as I did as an undergraduate.
The last couple of years I didn't
work nearly as hard as I did as an
undergraduate — in third year
you probably don't work as
much."
The other grad students inter
viewed worked varying amounts
— some harder, some not as hard
as they had as undergraduates. It
seems that work time varies
more from one individual to the
next than from one school to
another.
Adjectives applied to grad life
include: 'brutalizing," "excit
ing," "tiring," "refreshing" and
"sobering."
According to Prof. Polhemus,
it's worse than being an under-
So you're graduating, eh? Are
you ready to leave the ivory
tower and venture into the
jungle? Or have you decided to
procrastinate before making that
final leap by going to grad
school? If you've joined the lat
ter group, these remarks by grad
students should help you pre
pare for the joys and frustrations
ahead.
The "universal grad student"
doesn't exist. Experiences differ
from university to university,
academic school to academic
school, and individual to indi
vidual. Certain grad life aspects
seem to be common though.
By definition, graduate educa
tion teaches students to
specialize in one subject area
while the undergraduate educa
tion is geared to more general
study, exposing the student to
many areas of knowledge.
David Margolick, a third-year
law student, found the change
from undergrad to grad life
"phenomenal."
"I was flabbergasted at how
narrow my own orbit was. The
parameters of your whole being
shrink fantastically. People in
grad school define their goals
more narrowly. It's not the
smorgasbord that you get as an
undergrad."
"The decision to enter grad
school represents a first step to
ward a career and carries a sense
of great responsibility," said
Peter Brooks, a first year grad
student in mathematics.
"It's a shock for most people
when they go to grad school,"
claims DanaGioia, a second-year
business student. "It's designed
to be a bleak time — the purpose
is to transform you from a jerk
with wide interests intoa profes
sional."
Most of the grads interviewed
agreed with Margolick that grad
school is "a quantum leap up in
intensity and commitment. It's a
difficult place to vacillate in,"
Convictions
"As a grad student, you have
to have the conviction you're
sure what you want to do and
throw yourself into it," said
Gioia. "You have to spend the
majority of your time in your
area. If you're not sure you want
to be in grad school, you'll have a
miserable time.
"Teachers are less sympathetic
to anyone having an identity
crisis," Gioia remarked. "Their

feeling is that if you have any
doubts, you shouldn't be there.
"The biggest problem facing
grad students is doubt. Grad stu
dents are always asking them
selves: Did I do the right
thing?' " said English Prof. Rob
Polhemus.
"As an undergraduate you
don't make a fatal commitment.
Grad students are committed yet
they don't have the money or the
sway (decision-making power)
of a profession," Polhemus ad
ded.
"People often define their
whole undergraduate experi
ence in terms of graduate school
without thinking about the
commitment itself," claimed
Margolick.

Student says:

"It's a shock for most people when they go to grad school. It's
designed to be a bleak time — the purpose is to transform you from
a jerk with wide interests into a professional... as a grad student,
you have to have the conviction you're sure what you want to do
and throw yourself into it. If you're not sure you want to be in grad
school, you'll have a miserable time."

For some, the "best thing
about law school is getting in,
and it's downhill afterwards. A
lot of people feel law school will
answer all their problems; it is
the path of least resistance."
'Sublimate'
"People with strong interests
in other fields, however, may
have a hard time. You have to
sublimate yourself to something
you may not care as much about.
It's right for a lot of people. But
when it's wrong, it's wrong."
Brooks enjoys focusing on one
area of study. "In part, it's a
sense of being allowed to do
what you want to do with fewer
distractions. You finally have
the chance to devote yourself to
something.
Robin Staffin, a fourth year
graduate student in physics, also
appreciates the opportunity to
specialize. Staffin said he had no
adjustment problem as a grad
student. "1 was dying to do some
research."
A physics grad student spends
most of his time working with
his adviser. "Your adviser may
suggest a problem then you in
vestigate it to see where it
leads."
Although physics grads do
take some classes, most of their
work is individual. You have to
draw moral support from your
self to a much greater extent. The
problem you're working on has
never been done.
Working on my own project is
I

much more exciting and relev
ant. I have a greater appetite for
learning.
"The urge to understand na
ture is a very overpowering
thing. It's hard to convey, but
there's a kind of poetry about se
eing nature on a deeper level.
What could be a more human
experience than seeing the un
derlying beauty of the unive
seaB"
As an undergraduate, "things
are well-defined. You have
books to read and problems to
do," explained Staffin. "A
graduate student working on a
problem has a different experi
ence. The hardest thing is to
formulate the right question.
This is much more difficult but

it's also more exciting.
Relevant to world
"The solution to your problem
is relevant to the world. I believe
physics is the real world, not just
an algebraic exercise."
Staffin explained that the
work he is doing is very similar
to what he would do as a profes
sional research associate. A grad
student in physics is much
closer to being a professional
than a student, according to Staf
fin.
The graduate program in En
glish, in contrast, "is still
school," commented Patty Ruth,
a fourth year English grad. Your
first two years are spent taking
courses, teaching and being a
TA. After that, you develop an
area of specialization, prepare
for your oral exam and begin
work on your dissertation.
Students in most other
academic fields follow a similar
program of studies. Although
undergrads and grads in
academic fields both take
courses, grad courses are much
smaller and are usually
discussion-oriented.
"I probably learn more from a
graduate seminar," said Prof.
Polhemus. During discusssions,
students find new ideas bounc
ing off of each other.
In law school, there is also
more exchange between stu
dents and professors, said Prof.
John Kaplan, who teaches both
undergrads and grads "Law

students have got to be thinking
all the time. I ask them questions
and we are constantly discus
sing issues." He explained that
this is a grave difference from a
large lecture class an undergrad
might have to take. "I demand
that my law students speak."
According to Kaplan, "Law
students are a little more tired
than undergradutes. Law school
is more demanding."
"The teaching method is diffe
rent in law school," Kaplan
said. "We focus on little prob
lems and go into them in greater
depth. Undergraduates study
broader problems and go into
them in a necessarily more sup
erficial manner."
"In law school you discuss

minor points and there is no
answer to your questions. We
don't even pretend there are
answers any more," said Mar
golick "There is a lot of knit
picking. You'll often spend 50
minutes discussing tiny points.
At first, it's exasperating that
there are no answers. Eventu
ally, you realize that law school
is more process-oriented. You
discuss finding pathways, rather
than answers to problems."
Margolick contended that there
are few scholars in law school.
"Most law students are not
motivated by a true love of the
material, but look on it as a tool
towards their professional goal."
"The way the curriculum is
designed, it's very hard to love
it,"he commented. "Most
people go in as a three year trial
to put up with."
Biz school's pragmatic
Gioia is more positive about
business school. Business stu
dents also study cases but dis
cussions are very pragmatic.
"You are given practical prob
lems to solve which is refreshing
compared to a theory or textbook
course," he said.
He compares business school
to reading Time magazine for
two years. "You get little
snatches of everything and it's
rarely boring. Business school
trains you to be a generalist
while every other grad school
trains you to be a specialist."
Another biz student described

his experience somewhat diffe
rently. He said it was like "eating
beans three meals a day for two
years."
"Grades matter a great deal in
law school," said Margolick.
"The first thing employers look

more relaxed. As individuals
law students are typically gentle
and nice — there aren't too many
hard-ass or cutthroat types. Of
course, you're dealing with the
cream of the crop — these law
students were all stars from
other schools. But as law schools
go, it's very friendly."
Loneliness
One of the problems facing
graduate students is the diffi
culty of meeting students out
side their discipline. "Grad stu
dents usually live in an apart

ment off campus and you tend to
meet the same people in all your
classes," explained Gioia, the
business student.
"It's a common complaint of
the men in business school that
they are very, very lonely and
can't meet women." (This is due
to the disproportionate number
of men in biz school). "Some
men in biz school spend half
their time in public places leer
ing at women," Gioia quipped.
The business school, itself has
one of the healthiest social prog
rams because the married
couples tend to organize social
get-togethers, according to
Gioia. "The trouble is that the
social life is completely centered
around the business school.
You 're sort of trapped — 1 ike in a
company town.
"Biz school is completely
self-contained. It has its own lib
rary and cafeteria and is cut-off
from the rest of the school in its
physical location.
According to Patty Ruth, En
glish grad student, the English
department also has an active
social program but "since it's a
small department, there aren't
enough people to restrict your
social life to — especially if
you're an unattached student."
Margolick said law students
also have a hard time meeting
others. "I miss terribly meeting
grad students from other de
partments. I feel that it has hurt
my growth as an individual.
"I tried meeting people at or
ganized functions more in my

first year. But the situation just
isn't nat.-iral or spontaneous.
When they corral students
and put punch glasses in your
hands, it doesn't work."
Grad students may not
socialize as much because they
don't have the time, ventured
math grad Brooks. "A greater
proportion of time is spent doing
your work. But you spend a lot of
time because you like to do it,"
he added.
The pressure isn't external but
internal, he explained. "You're
more on your own."
In law school and business

graduate or a professional. There
is too much pressure for a grad
student to prove himself and not
much glamour or money.
Biz Prof. Bob Simoni did not
think being a graduate student
was so bad. "There are different
frustrations facing grad stu
dents, but no more than those
facing undergrads," he con
tended. "There are always hur
dles to jump — that's life."
Perhaps this grad student said
it."The experience of being a
grad student is not something
you can articulate — it's just a
feeling in your gut."

school there is more external
pressure. According to Gioia, "if
you did all the work that was
assigned in biz school, you'd be
working all the time. The secret
of business school is learning to
do the work selectively. You
don't have to go to all the classes,
or to all the readings. It's even
possible to rush projects — you
can basically choose to do most
of your work in areas that in
terest you.
"The first two quarters they
work the fuck out of you but after
that it's not too hard. I am sure
I've abused the system at Stan
ford as much as anyone," Gioia
added.
"The first year is the worst
year" in law school too, accord
ing to Margolick. "At the begin
ning of law school I spent about
the same amount of time work
ing as I did as an undergraduate.
The last couple of years I didn't
work nearly as hard as I did as an
undergraduate — in third year
you probably don't work as
much."
The other grad students inter
viewed worked varying amounts
— some harder, some not as hard
as they had as undergraduates. It
seems that work time varies
more from one individual to the
next than from one school to
another.
Adjectives applied to grad life
include: 'brutalizing," "excit

"sobering."
