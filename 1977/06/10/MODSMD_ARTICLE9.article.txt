# No matter the school, caps & gowns are the rule

Caps and gowns, diplomas, bac
calaureate — the stuff of graduations
everywhere. Commencement rituals
are similar in most colleges and uni
versities across the country. A few dif
fer in their rituals and practices. A
sampling:
In one of the more unusual com
mencement ceremonies this spring, a
cartoon character graduated from
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Law School. The
degree candidate was Joanie Caucus,
the late-blooming feminist in the
Doonesbury cartoon strip by Garry
Trudeau. Her graduation is the final
step in a cooperative charade played
out by Trudeau, Boalt administrators
and the law students themselves.
In 1974 Trudeau decided to embark
Joanie on a career in law.
Seating it out
"She applied to Berkeley and was
sweating out the letter, like all applic
ants do," said Boalt Assistant Dean
William Hill. "As long as Trudeau had
decided on Berkeley, we decided to go
along with the gag."
Joanie's picture was printed in the
yearbook and the 300 law graduates
invited creator Trudeau to be the
keynote speaker at the commence
ment.

There was a seat reserved for
Joanie, her cap was on the chair and
her name was called," said Lynda
Stominski, the offical in charge of
graduation at Boalt. Trudeau accepted
Joanie s diploma for her, and Dean
Sanford Radish gave Joanie "clinical
credits although she had missed one
year of study, Slominski added.
Harvard is unusual in that it holds a
joint ceremony with Radcliffe, once its
feminine counterpart. The two shcools
cooperate academically, so the degrees
awarded are from Harvard. Women re
ceive a Harvard degree with the
Radcliffe name on it, said Vic
koivumaki, associate dean for class ac
tivities and alumni reunions.
Parades
The 326 th commencement cere
mony is quite extensive," added
Koivumaki. There are several parades,
the first in the morning beginning with
a formal procession led by local
sheriffs. Dignitaries and the governor
of Massachusetts are invited, and the
audiece ranges from 17,000-20,000.
The 1600 degree candidates will be
welcomed to the "company of edu
cated men and women," Koivumaki
said. The actual diplomas are pre
sented in department luncheons. In
the afternoon, everyone returns for the

commencement speeches. There is a
second procession led by the "oldest
living ambulatory alumnus." This
year that honor goes to Arthur Drink
water, class of 1900.
Following the parade there will be
speeches by Harvard President Derek
Bok (a Stanford graduate) and Rep.
Barbara Jordan (D-Texas). Several days
earlier, on senior day, George
Plimpton will address the seniors as
they give out awards including a "sort
of unsung hero award," added
Kovumaki.
Pomp and circumstance
The military academies continue to
hold commencements full of pomp,
circumstance and ritual. At the Naval
Academy at Annapolis, Commandant
Robert Lewis, in charge of academy
public affairs, said the graduation is
"quite a ceremony." Vice President
Walter Mondale will speak to the 950
members of the class of 1977 in the
Navy Marine Corps Stadium while an
audience of about 15,000 watches.
Capt. Van Shields of the Air Force
Academy said the ceremony there is
"pretty straightforward." The
graduates walk across the stage, salute
and receive their diploma. The com
mander says, "Gentlemen, you are
dismissed," and they throw their hats

into the air.
In addition, there is the tradition of
"tailend Charlie." He is the last man in
the class (on an academic and military
ranking). A big silver bowl is set on the
stage and as each first classman
(senior) walks by he is encouraged to
put in a dollar for Charlie.
President Jimmy Carter was the
commencement speaker at Notre
Dame in a two-hour ceremony held
several weeks ago.
Students will be the featured speak
ers at UCLA, according to Patty Carew,
secretary of the Committee on Public
Ceremonies.
"Traditionally, we don't have some
one of fame and fortune to speak," said
Carew. There is no baccalaureate, but
UCLA does retain the formal academic
procession and the ceremony follows a
traditional pattern, Carew added.
Other famous keynote speakers in
clude former President Gerald Ford,
who will speak at his son's school, the
Gordon Conwell Theological Semi
nary in Massachusetts. Sen. Barry
Goldwater, (R-Ariz.) will speak at the
University of Arizona, the school he
left in 1929 to go into business. Writer
Ray Bradbury will speak at the School
of Letters and Humanities at Cal
State-Long Beach.

"quite a ceremony." Vice President
Walter Mondale will speak to the 950
members of the class of 1977 in the
Navy Marine Corps Stadium while an
audience of about 15,000 watches.
Capt. Van Shields of the Air Force
Academy said the ceremony there is
"pretty straightforward." The
graduates walk across the stage, salute
and receive their diploma. The com
mander says, "Gentlemen, you are
dismissed," and they throw their hats

into the air.
In addition, there is the tradition of
"tailend Charlie." He is the last man in
the class (on an academic and military
ranking). A big silver bowl is set on the
stage and as each first classman
(senior) walks by he is encouraged to
put in a dollar for Charlie.
President Jimmy Carter was the
commencement speaker at Notre
Dame in a two-hour ceremony held
several weeks ago.
Students will be the featured speak
ers at UCLA, according to Patty Carew,
secretary of the Committee on Public
Ceremonies.
"Traditionally, we don't have some
one of fame and fortune to speak," said
Carew. There is no baccalaureate, but
UCLA does retain the formal academic
procession and the ceremony follows a
traditional pattern, Carew added.

Caps and gowns, diplomas, bac
calaureate — the stuff of graduations
everywhere. Commencement rituals
are similar in most colleges and uni
versities across the country. A few dif
fer in their rituals and practices. A
sampling:
In one of the more unusual com
mencement ceremonies this spring, a
cartoon character graduated from
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Law School. The
degree candidate was Joanie Caucus,
the late-blooming feminist in the
Doonesbury cartoon strip by Garry
Trudeau. Her graduation is the final
step in a cooperative charade played
out by Trudeau, Boalt administrators
and the law students themselves.
In 1974 Trudeau decided to embark
Joanie on a career in law.
Seating it out
"She applied to Berkeley and was
sweating out the letter, like all applic
ants do," said Boalt Assistant Dean
William Hill. "As long as Trudeau had
decided on Berkeley, we decided to go
along with the gag."
Joanie's picture was printed in the
yearbook and the 300 law graduates
invited creator Trudeau to be the
keynote speaker at the commence
ment.

There was a seat reserved for
Joanie, her cap was on the chair and
her name was called," said Lynda
Stominski, the offical in charge of
graduation at Boalt. Trudeau accepted
Joanie s diploma for her, and Dean
Sanford Radish gave Joanie "clinical
credits although she had missed one
year of study, Slominski added.
Harvard is unusual in that it holds a
joint ceremony with Radcliffe, once its
feminine counterpart. The two shcools
cooperate academically, so the degrees
awarded are from Harvard. Women re
ceive a Harvard degree with the
Radcliffe name on it, said Vic
koivumaki, associate dean for class ac
tivities and alumni reunions.
Parades
The 326 th commencement cere
mony is quite extensive," added
Koivumaki. There are several parades,
the first in the morning beginning with
a formal procession led by local
sheriffs. Dignitaries and the governor
of Massachusetts are invited, and the
audiece ranges from 17,000-20,000.
The 1600 degree candidates will be
welcomed to the "company of edu
cated men and women," Koivumaki
said. The actual diplomas are pre
sented in department luncheons. In
the afternoon, everyone returns for the

commencement speeches. There is a
second procession led by the "oldest
living ambulatory alumnus." This
year that honor goes to Arthur Drink
water, class of 1900.
Following the parade there will be
speeches by Harvard President Derek
Bok (a Stanford graduate) and Rep.
Barbara Jordan (D-Texas). Several days
earlier, on senior day, George
Plimpton will address the seniors as
they give out awards including a "sort
of unsung hero award," added
Kovumaki.
Pomp and circumstance
The military academies continue to
hold commencements full of pomp,
circumstance and ritual. At the Naval
Academy at Annapolis, Commandant
Robert Lewis, in charge of academy
public affairs, said the graduation is
"quite a ceremony." Vice President
