A spokesman at the Supreme
Court said a response from the
Daily's attorneys is due by July 7.
The appeal stemmed from a
lawsuit the Daily filed against
certain members of the Palo Alto
Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office after a raid by Palo Alto
police of the Daily offices on
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won its suit on
both the federal district court
level and at the appeals court
level.
Appeals
Palo Alto appealed to the Sup
reme Court last April 26 fol
lowed by Santa Clara County on
May 11. At the time of the coun
ty's appeal, California Atty. Gen.
Evelle Younger's office entered
the case on the County's side.
The raid took place when four
Palo Alto police officers carrying
* search warrant entered the
Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and repor
ters' notes. The police were try
ing to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants
in an April 9, 1971 riot at Stan
ford Hospital.
The riot occurred after a 30-
hour sit-in protesting the firing

of a black hospital worker turned
violent as 175 Santa Clara
sheriff's deputies and Palo Alto
police officers tried to clear 60
demonstrators from a barricaded
administrative corridor.
Arrests
During the melee that fol
lowed, 23 demonstrators were
arrested and at least 37 persons,
including 13 police officers,
were reported injured.

A spokesman at the Supreme
Court said a response from the
Daily's attorneys is due by July 7.
The appeal stemmed from a
lawsuit the Daily filed against
certain members of the Palo Alto
Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office after a raid by Palo Alto
police of the Daily offices on
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won its suit on
both the federal district court
level and at the appeals court
level.
Appeals
Palo Alto appealed to the Sup
reme Court last April 26 fol
lowed by Santa Clara County on
May 11. At the time of the coun
ty's appeal, California Atty. Gen.
Evelle Younger's office entered
the case on the County's side.
The raid took place when four
Palo Alto police officers carrying
* search warrant entered the
Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and repor
ters' notes. The police were try
ing to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants
in an April 9, 1971 riot at Stan
ford Hospital.
The riot occurred after a 30-
hour sit-in protesting the firing

of a black hospital worker turned
violent as 175 Santa Clara
sheriff's deputies and Palo Alto
police officers tried to clear 60
demonstrators from a barricaded
administrative corridor.
Arrests
During the melee that fol
lowed, 23 demonstrators were
arrested and at least 37 persons,
including 13 police officers,
were reported injured.
