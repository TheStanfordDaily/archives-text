# Lyman analyzes problems

Social institutions are in had
repute and can be saved only if
people try at least modest reform
attempts and if they "trust each
other just a little," President
Richard Lyman told the June 12
commencement audience.
His farewell to the Class of
1977 urged graduates to "come
to grips with the problem. . .and
for this, only two approaches are
really possible.
"We can seek out heroes, to
replace the managers, and in ef
fect give them an open mandate
to save us from our institutions
and ourselves," Lyman said.

"Or we can use our institu
tions to improve, curb, or reform
themselves and each other.
Lyman admitted that the latter
process, though better in his
mind, "may remind one of oneof
those magnificently convoluted
and horrible paintings of
Hieronymus Bosch. . . .
"We urge the Congress to re
form the courts, we go to court to
reform business or education or
anything and everything, and
we form public interest lobbies
to try to reform congress."
Despite this he said "the effort
to make our institutions serve us

is surely not an ignoble one."
He pointed out that any reform
or improvement attempt "is
usually better than none at
all. . . . Recently 1 came across a
report of a public opinion poll in
which the question asked was,
What's the principal sickness in
America today, ignorance or
apathy?To which the majority of
respondents answered, I don t
know and 1 don't care.
Such attitudes have hurt so
cial institutions, Lyman said and
only revival of people
consciousness will rescue them.
