# One way to win a Gores
## 
### George Anders 
When the Bio 22 teaching
assignment passed from
Donald Kennedy to a new as
sistant professor, H. Craig
Heller, in January 1972, Hel
ler was commuting from San
Diego, and concerned he
would be "a disappointment
after such a magnificent pre
decessor."
Now, Heller is a tenured as
sociate prof, and a recipient of
the 1977 Gores award for ex
cellence in teaching. His cita
tion, read at commencement,
June 12, calledhis instruction
"so outstanding that his
course has been described as
a model of its kind nation
ally."
"He's probably the best
prof 1 had at Stanford," said
John Oval, a recently
graduated senior. "His or
ganization is tight, he has a
nice sense of humor — he's
just an excellent teacher."
Its a result that hasn't come
without effort. "It's not un
usual, after having given the
course for five years, to spend
four or five hours preparing
one lecture," Heller said.
'Golden tablets'
"The field (animal
physiology) moves so rapidly
that you have to find out what
has been done in the last
year." he explained. "I have
to resist the temptation to cast
the lectures into golden tab
lets — into offset notes that
would be resistant to
change."
"The whole thrill of teach
ing is imparting your excite
ment to someone else, and

watching them become ex
cited." he added. "That's the
most positive feedback you
can get."
Entertaining can be an im
portant part of teaching. Hel
ler stated, explaining that he
will sometimes use a gim
mick in lecture to help stu
dents remember a concept.
Interest sparked
No one thing sparked his
interest in teaching, Heller
said, although, "some very
good teachers" he had as an
undergraduate and graduate
student were influential.
Kennedy, who was a biol
ogy prof when Heller came
here, and is now Food and
Drug Administration com
missioner, was "a remarkable
teacher," Heller said.
"Fie could lecture on his
laundry list and make it
sound interesting. It was a
hard act to follow and it made
me work all the harder,"
In addition to teaching Bio
22 and upper division biol
ogy classes, Heller directs
undergraduates on research
projects during the school
year and takes under
graduates with him on sum
mer field work in the Sierra
Nevada.
'More important'
"In terms of teaching un
dergraduates, the field work
in many cases may be more
important than classroom in
struction," he said.
I.ast summer, over 20 stu
dents accompanied Heller to
his Sierra Nevada work sta
tion, he said. About four stu
dents do research for him dur

ing the school year, primarily
on the physiology of thermal
regulation in animals, he ad
ded.
"It's not unusual for under
graduates to do research," he
said. "Hut I seem to have more
than others do." This despite
the fact that Heller asks his
researchers to work full time,
requiring them to stop out for
a quarter or more.
Two other instructors also
received Gores awards at
commencement. They are
graduate student Jon Reider,
who worked with the Struc
tural Liberal Education prog
ram, and Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam.
Dinkelspiel awards
Also presented at com
mencement were four Din
kelspiel awards for outstand
ing service to undergraduate
education.
They went to Physics De
partment Chairman Walter
Meyerhof, Nancy Packer, di
rector of Freshman English,
and seniors Charlotte Mason
and Al Tomaszczuk.
Meyerhof was cited for
playing a key role in bring
ing astronomy into the cur
riculum, peer review into the
evaluation of teaching, and
women and minority stu
dents into science as a
career."
Mason was manager of
teacher evaluation programs
for the engineering honor
society, Tau Heta Pi. To
maszczuk was an ASSU vice
president and senior house
associate at Madera House.

course has been described as
a model of its kind nation
ally."
"He's probably the best
prof 1 had at Stanford," said
John Oval, a recently
graduated senior. "His or
ganization is tight, he has a
nice sense of humor — he's
just an excellent teacher."
Its a result that hasn't come
without effort. "It's not un
usual, after having given the
course for five years, to spend
four or five hours preparing
one lecture," Heller said.
'Golden tablets'
"The field (animal
physiology) moves so rapidly
that you have to find out what
has been done in the last
year." he explained. "I have
to resist the temptation to cast
the lectures into golden tab
lets — into offset notes that
would be resistant to
change."
"The whole thrill of teach
ing is imparting your excite
ment to someone else, and

watching them become ex
cited." he added. "That's the
most positive feedback you
can get."
Entertaining can be an im
portant part of teaching. Hel
ler stated, explaining that he
will sometimes use a gim
mick in lecture to help stu
dents remember a concept.
Interest sparked
No one thing sparked his
interest in teaching, Heller
said, although, "some very
good teachers" he had as an
undergraduate and graduate
student were influential.
Kennedy, who was a biol
ogy prof when Heller came
here, and is now Food and
Drug Administration com
missioner, was "a remarkable
teacher," Heller said.
"Fie could lecture on his
laundry list and make it
sound interesting. It was a
hard act to follow and it made
me work all the harder,"
In addition to teaching Bio
22 and upper division biol
ogy classes, Heller directs
undergraduates on research
projects during the school
year and takes under
graduates with him on sum
mer field work in the Sierra
Nevada.
'More important'
"In terms of teaching un
dergraduates, the field work
in many cases may be more
important than classroom in
struction," he said.
I.ast summer, over 20 stu
dents accompanied Heller to
his Sierra Nevada work sta
tion, he said. About four stu
dents do research for him dur

ing the school year, primarily
on the physiology of thermal
regulation in animals, he ad
ded.
"It's not unusual for under
graduates to do research," he
said. "Hut I seem to have more
than others do." This despite
the fact that Heller asks his
researchers to work full time,
requiring them to stop out for
a quarter or more.
Two other instructors also
received Gores awards at
commencement. They are
graduate student Jon Reider,
who worked with the Struc
tural Liberal Education prog
ram, and Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam.
Dinkelspiel awards
Also presented at com
mencement were four Din
kelspiel awards for outstand
ing service to undergraduate
education.
They went to Physics De
partment Chairman Walter
Meyerhof, Nancy Packer, di
rector of Freshman English,
and seniors Charlotte Mason
and Al Tomaszczuk.
Meyerhof was cited for
playing a key role in bring
ing astronomy into the cur
riculum, peer review into the
evaluation of teaching, and
women and minority stu
dents into science as a
career."
Mason was manager of
teacher evaluation programs
for the engineering honor
society, Tau Heta Pi. To

president and senior house
associate at Madera House.
