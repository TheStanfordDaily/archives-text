grandmothers chose to leave their

B ter view of the ceremony. As the

graduates came streaming in, the mar
chers in front found their way was
blocked.
The marchers tried to step aside, but
were pushed directly into the grand
mothers. Ushers came rushing out, shout
ing "Ladies, Ladies! Please step aside!"
But the grandmothers were oblivious to
the noise and stayed put until the ushers
forced them to move.
Lost track
As the procession split in two, and can
didates filed into different groups of
seats, most of the audience lost track of
what was going on. Except for one man
who asserted: "What they're doing there
is symbolic of the avant garde tradition of
American drama in the 19605."
Less analytical spectators were settling
for photographs. Movie cameras whirred,
shutters clicked, and telephoto lenses
honed in on one particular cap and gown.
About 100 feet from the procession, one
photo expert was offering advice. "No, I
don't think vou need to use a flash. It's not
that cloudy." As an afterthought, he ad
ded. "Besides, a flash probably wouldn't
carry that well anyway.
As the procession continued, more and
more of the crowd sat down, with only a
few persons still waiting to see their can
didate.
And for nearly all the rest of the cere
monies, spectators remained seated. They
applauded politely at the right times, and
stood for the Stanford Hymn (which no
one was able to sing). But the frenzied
excitement which had accompanied the
procession was now gone.
