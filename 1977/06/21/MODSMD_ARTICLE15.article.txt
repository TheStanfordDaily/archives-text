# Council revises the Honor Code
## 
### 
A revised Honor Code took ef
fect here yesterday, replacing
the 56-year-old previous one.
The new code stresses preven
tative, rather than punitive mea
sures, according to Philip Rhine
lander, emeritus professor of
philosophy and chairman of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) which drafted
and enacted the code.
Attached to the new Honor
Code is a supplementary set of
applications and interpreta
tions.
Yesterday's enactment came
after nearly two years of work on
the code. In December 1975,
President Richard Lyman and
the ASSU Council of Presidents
both asked the SCLC to reassess
the code.
Two public hearings
The council then held two
public hearings on the code,
drafted therevised codein April,
and gave the code final approval
by a unanimous vote on June 2.
Under the Legislative and Jud
icial Charter of the University, a
piece of proposed legislation
must pass two readings by the
council before it can become
law. The new Honor Code had
also received unanimous ap
proval at t he SCLC's first reading
in May.
Rewordings in the code
should "shift theemphasis of the
code so it's not on penalties as
much as it is on preventive mea
sures," Rhinelander said.

The new code stresses preven
tative, rather than punitive mea
sures, according to Philip Rhine
lander, emeritus professor of
philosophy and chairman of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) which drafted
and enacted the code.
Attached to the new Honor
Code is a supplementary set of
applications and interpreta
tions.
Yesterday's enactment came
after nearly two years of work on
the code. In December 1975,
President Richard Lyman and
the ASSU Council of Presidents
both asked the SCLC to reassess
the code.
Two public hearings
The council then held two
public hearings on the code,
drafted therevised codein April,
and gave the code final approval
by a unanimous vote on June 2.
Under the Legislative and Jud
icial Charter of the University, a
piece of proposed legislation
must pass two readings by the
council before it can become
law. The new Honor Code had
also received unanimous ap
proval at t he SCLC's first reading
in May.
Rewordings in the code
should "shift theemphasis of the
code so it's not on penalties as
much as it is on preventive mea
sures," Rhinelander said.
