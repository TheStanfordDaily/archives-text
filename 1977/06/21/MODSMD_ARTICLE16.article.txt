# Trustee group to study C-IR, investment policy
## 
### 
A Board of Trustees ad hoc
committee will be convening
this summer to review the con
troversial Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR).
The C-IR makes recommenda
tions to the vice president of bus
iness and finance about how the
University should vote on resol
utions of companies it holds
shares in. Actual votes are de
termined by the trustees.
The ad hoc committee will
also review the University's
statement on investment policy,
formulated in 1971. In mid-fall,
the group will report to the trus
tees.
This year, several student sit
ins have been prompted by the
University's decision to abstain
on proxies calling for the J.P.
Stevens Co. to change its labor
practices, and for six companies
to withdraw or stop expanding
their investments in South Af
rica.
Members of the ad hoc com
mittee have yet to be selected,
according to Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president for public affairs.
It will include a faculty chair
man and two other faculty mem
bers, three students, three ad

ministrators and two trustees.
The committee will begin
meeting this summer and report
to the trustees by mid-autumn,
Rosenzweig added.
The trustees created the com
mittee at their June 10 meeting,
through a measure which stated
the committee was established
"without preconception as to it's
outcome."
"No one is going to speculate
what the committee will do,"
Secretary to the University Fred
Glover stressed.
Faculty members will be
placed on the ad hoc committee
by the Academic Council's
Committee on Committees,
Rosenzweig said. The Hoard ot
Trustees and the Alumni As
sociation will choose their
members, he added.
The three students would
normally be placed on the ad hoc
committee by the ASSU Senate.
With most senators away from
the area, ASSU co-president
Greg Larson said the co
presidents will select student
members if a summer senate
does not convene.
Also on June 10, French Prof.
Raymond Giraud presented fa

culty petitions calling for recon
stitution of the C-IR to Board of
Trustees President Peter Bing.
The petitions had 213 signa
tures.
The petition also called for the
University "to take an un
equivocal position in discourag
ing expansion and continuation
of U.S. corporate investment in
South Africa." Another 25 had
signed a petition with only the
South Africa plank.
Giraud said he felt the C-IR
should include staff members
and that because of the way per
sons are now placed on the C-IR,
"we don't have a group which
represents the community."
"I encountered very few
people who said no to the peti
tions," Giraud said. He noted
that the petition was submitted
to Bing without having been cir
culated in many departments,
and speculated that "if we had
gotten to all the faculty, we
probably would have gotten over
500 signatures."
The faculty petition states that
U.S. corporations with invest
ments in South Africa are
bolstering the apartheid regime
there.
