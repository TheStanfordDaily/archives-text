# Trustees postpone sororities decision
## 
### 
If sororities are going to be re
vived here, it won't be for a
while.
At its June 10 meeting, the
Board of Trustees postponed
until November a vote on
whether to rescind its 1944 ban
on sororities, according to Norm
Robinson, associate dean of stu
dent affairs.
"The board wanted a better
sense of what criteria would
have to be met for a sorority to be
established here," Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs, explained.
University studies of the
sorority issue have focused on
the possibility that Stanford may
be violating an anti-sex dis
crimination statute by allowing
fraternities but not sororities.
So far, administrators have

devoted less attention to propos
ing standards by which a soror
ity could come on campus if the
ban were lifted, Rosenzweig
said.
Robinson said he and others in
the dean of student affairs' office
will begin consideration of pos
sible standards, and will consult
students and University attor
neys.
"A bunch" of national
sororities have written the Uni
versity, expressing an interest in
establishing a chapter here,
Robinson said. "Any national
that has stationary is going to
send a letter."
However, he added, only one
group of four women students
has contacted him to express an
interest in torming a sorority
here.
