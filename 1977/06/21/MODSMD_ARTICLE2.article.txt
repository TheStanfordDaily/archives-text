"I know that Bill's good sense
and good humor will serve him
and Stanford well. I'm delighted
to welcome him aboard this new
and critical assignment."
Praise for Smith
Praising the board's approval
of Smith, Lyman said his "ener
gies of mind and spirit, the un
usual breadth of his experience
— as an attorney, university ad
ministrator. and college presi
dent — and his clear devotion to
Stanford's future all combine to
make him an opportune choice.
"In assuming the respon
sibilities as ably discharged by

Ken Cuthbertson, Joel's fairness
and force will serve Stanford and
the independent sector of higher
education well. I'm delighted to
bid him welcome to the enter
prise and excited to have him
take on this significant new
role."
Smith is a former president of
Denison University.

the University of Michigan Law
School, and Young, executive
