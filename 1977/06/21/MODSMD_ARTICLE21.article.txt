fices after one of its officers
:laimed that Daily photo
graphers might have been in a
position to take pictures of de
nonstrators attacking police.
The ensuing search of the Daily
urned up no such evidence.
According to Jerome Falk. one
ifthe Daily's lawyers, it was the
irstknown time in U.S. history
hat police have used a warrant
osearch a news organization for
ividence. The more common
nethod is to use a subpoena to
equest that a newspaper turn
)ver material authorities want.
Other searches
Since the Daily search, the Los
Angeles Star and the Berkeley
sit have fat ed similar situa
ions.
The Daily filed suit on May 13,
9" 1, against Palo Alto Police
'hiel James /.urcher, the four
'alo Alto police officers in
ched in the search, Santa Clara
-ounty District Attorney Louis
lergna. Deputy District Attor-
Craig Brown and Judge j.
wrton Phelps, the magistrate
issued the search warrant.
In its suit the Daily asked that

unconstitutional, a perma

paper offices are impermissible
in all but a very few situations."
A third-party search is one in
which the property of a person
who may have evidence of a
crime but who is not suspected
of committing it is searched.
No injunction
Peckham declined to issue an
injunction, saying "there is no
reason to believe that . . the de
fendants (the police) will con
duct such a search against the
plaintiffs (Daily) in the future."
An injunction would be "un
necessary," he said.
In a later decision, Peckham
awarded the Daily $47,500 in at
torneys' fees.
Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County appealed the district
court ruling to the U.S. Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals on Au
gust 21. 1974. asking it to review
all decisions in favor of the
Daily.
In a unanimous decision last
Feb. 2, the court of appeals sided
with the Daily and accepted the
district court's ruling without
amendment. It also found that at
torneys' fees should be awarded
but used a slightly different ar
gument than the district court.
The appeals court rejected two
claims made by the City of Palo
Alto after Peckham's original
decision had been made. One ar
gument was that Phelps, the is
suing magistrate, was the only
proper defendant, while the
other was that the Daily had im
properly sued law enforcement
personnel.
A request by Palo Alto and
Santa Clara County that the ap
oeals court rehear the case was
rejected by the court and the two
governments then appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court.

A third-party search is one in

No injunction
Peckham declined to issue an
injunction, saying "there is no
reason to believe that . . the de
fendants (the police) will con
duct such a search against the
plaintiffs (Daily) in the future."
An injunction would be "un
necessary," he said.
In a later decision, Peckham
awarded the Daily $47,500 in at

Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County appealed the district
court ruling to the U.S. Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals on Au
gust 21. 1974. asking it to review
all decisions in favor of the
Daily.
In a unanimous decision last
Feb. 2, the court of appeals sided
with the Daily and accepted the
district court's ruling without
amendment. It also found that at
torneys' fees should be awarded
but used a slightly different ar
gument than the district court.
The appeals court rejected two
claims made by the City of Palo
Alto after Peckham's original
decision had been made. One ar
gument was that Phelps, the is
suing magistrate, was the only
proper defendant, while the
other was that the Daily had im
properly sued law enforcement
personnel.
A request by Palo Alto and
Santa Clara County that the ap
oeals court rehear the case was
rejected by the court and the two
governments then appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
