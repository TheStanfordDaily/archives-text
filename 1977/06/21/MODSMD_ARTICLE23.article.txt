# Hospital exodus denied
## 
### 
Dr. Thomas Long, interim director of the Chil
dren's Hospital cancer program here, yesterday
denied reports that half of the hospital's 400 pa
tients were leaving the hospital to go to Pacific
Medical Center in San Francisco.
Last week, Dr. Jordan Wilbur, former head of the
hospital's pediatric oncology department, left
Stanford to launch a cancer program at Pacific.
Wilbur claimed that "more than half" of Stanford s
cancer patients were transferring to Pacific with
Tone estimated about J5 per cent of the hospi
tal's patients were transferring to Pacific. He noted
that since the hospital treats primarily outpatients,
the exact number leaving is still unknown.
Dr Harry Jennison, executive director ot Chil
dren's, estimated that only 25 patients were trans

ferring. He called reports of 200 transfers "a fig
ment of someone's imagination."
Wilbur also said four doctors were moving to
Pacific with him. Hut Jennison said only one of
those was an experienced, full-time doctor.
Long said he "can't detect any impact" on the
cancer program caused by Wilbur's departure.
In April, Wilbur had announced his intention to
leave Children's Hospital rather than step down as
head of the pediatric oncology department. Long
said Wilbur's research and administrative record
were issues which caused hospital administrators
to request the resignation.
Wilbur said his programs differ from most in
that he bad parents and patients administer
medicine, monitor charts and perform other tasks
usually left to hospital employes.
