# Judge cites USE for unfair labor practices
## 
### Randy Keith 
United Stanford Employees (USE) has
been ordered to "cease and desist from
two unfair labor practices after the union
was found guilty of violating a section of
the National Labor Relations Act.
In his ruling. Administrative Law
Judge Ferrold Shapiro found the union
guilty of distributing notices to newly
hired employes demanding that they join
the union, and of filing a lawsuit against
three other employes who retused to join
USE.
USE has announced that it will appeal
the ruling to the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) General Counsel's office in
Washington, D.C.
Shapiro's decision came more than a
year after the University first filed charges
with the NLRB accusing USE of:
—Distributing notices to newly hired
workers "demanding or requiring them to
join and become full members of (the un
ion);"
—Maintaining a grievance against the
University "seeking to require employee
Charles Hall to become a full member of
(the union);"
—Filing suit against University
employes Charles Hall. Lupe Del Real and
Ed Bartal, "seeking to compel said
employees to become full members of (the
union);" and
—Refusing to permit University
employes Jimmy Cabading and Richard
Haff to resign from full membership in the
union.

In his ruling that USE violated labor
law by distributing notices demanding
that new workers join the union. Shapiro
said the practice "constitutes an implied
threat of reprisal calculated to interfere
with the employee's statutory right to ref
rain from any and all union activities."
USE had notified new employes that
the union's contract with the University
stated they must join the union and that
"this meant filling out a membership ap
plication card and taking an oath of mem
bership." according to the decision.
Shapiro went on to say that member
ship in the union for contract purposes is
determined by the payment of dues, not
by taking the oath or filling out a member
ship card.
Shapiro also found the union guilty of
filing a lawsuit against three workers who
refused to join the union, stating,
"Clearly, the filing of this lawsuit reason
ably tended to coerce and restrain the
employes."
'Costly burden'
"Faced with the imposition of the
costly burden of defending against the
lawsuit, employees may well feel compel
led to forgo their guaranteed right" under
the labor relations act not to become full
members of the union, taking the oath,
"ratherthan risk involvement ina lawsuit
whose outcome they cannot predict."
USE had filed suit against Hall, Del
Real and Bartal on April 14. 1976 claim
ing that the three had been hired "upon
the condition that they promise to pay an

initiation fee to respondent (the unio
and to join and maintain proper membf
ship" in the uion. according to the de<
sion.
The workers breached their part of tl
bargain by not performing their promt
to pay the union's initiation tee and
join and maintain membership in the u:
ion, according to I SH the decision sat

Jim Berk, former president of US
