# Nine frats miss quotas
## 
### George Anders 
Nine of the 13 fraternities here
did not meet their University
pledge quotas during spring
rush, according to Tom
Hornbeak, assistant row direc
tor. , , ...
As a result, fraternities will
probably step up their efforts to
rush transfer students in the fall,
said Peter McCook, vice presi
dent of the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC).
"I imagine a couple of houses
will be making an effort" to rush
transfer students, he said.
"Otherwise, they'll be stuck

with empty spaces."
The IFC will write to each
male transfer student, informing
him of the fraternity housing op
tion, McCook added.
Past two years
Overall, fraternities were
asked to pledge 233 sophomore
equivalents, but pledged only
222 this spring, Hornbeak said.
In the past two years, the frater
nity system exceeded its quota
during spring rush.
A sophomore equivalent is a
person with two years of guaran
teed University housing remain
ing. A person with one year of

guaranteed housing remaining
counts as half a sophomore
equivalent.
The fraternity system will
probably meet its overall target
by October, Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of student affairs,
predicted. "But this won't help
some houses that are well below
quota," he added.
When the final results are
known, Hornbeak said, alumni
and administrators will consult
with officers of the frats below
quota to plan how those houses
will meet next year's require
