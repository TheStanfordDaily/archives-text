# Nine frats miss quotas
## 
### George Anders 
Nine of the 13 fraternities here
did not meet their University
pledge quotas during spring
rush, according to Tom
Hornbeak, assistant row direc
tor. , , ...
As a result, fraternities will
probably step up their efforts to
rush transfer students in the fall,
said Peter McCook, vice presi
dent of the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC).
"I imagine a couple of houses
will be making an effort" to rush
transfer students, he said.
"Otherwise, they'll be stuck

with empty spaces."
The IFC will write to each
male transfer student, informing
him of the fraternity housing op
tion, McCook added.
Past two years
Overall, fraternities were
asked to pledge 233 sophomore
equivalents, but pledged only
222 this spring, Hornbeak said.
In the past two years, the frater
nity system exceeded its quota
during spring rush.
A sophomore equivalent is a
person with two years of guaran
teed University housing remain
ing. A person with one year of

guaranteed housing remaining
counts as half a sophomore
equivalent.
The fraternity system will
probably meet its overall target
by October, Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of student affairs,
predicted. "But this won't help
some houses that are well below
quota," he added.
When the final results are
known, Hornbeak said, alumni
and administrators will consult
with officers of the frats below
quota to plan how those houses
will meet next year's require
ment.
'A bit complacent'
McCook predicted that frater
nities will meet next year's
quota, but said houses "might
have been a bit complacent" this
spring, since they had surpassed
their quota in spring 1976.
For this spring, Alpha Delta
Phi faced a target of 21.5 sopho
more equivalents, but had
pledged only 14 by May 19.
Theta Xi pledged only five
sophomore equivalents, with a
target of 12.5.
Both houses will need "spe
cial attention" next year,
Hornbeak said. "There's some
thing wrong when they miss
quota by that much," Robinson
added.
Other houses between 0.5 and
3.5 below quota were Beta Theta
Pi, Delta kappa Epsilon, Delta
Tau Delta, kappa Alpha, kappa
Sigma, Phi Delta Theta and
Theta Delta Chi.
Seven above quota
Delta Upsilon, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Chi and Zeta Psi
met their targets, with Sigma Chi
exceeding its quota b> seven.
"Sigma Chi was on the skids
about three or four years ago,"
Hornbeak said, "but it's really
rebuilt its popularity."
Fraternities may already have
pledged slightly more than 222
sophomore equivalents,
Hornbeak said, if "some

stragglers" chose to accept a
fraternity bid after May 19.
No fraternities are liable to be
placed in the draw next year,
Hornbeak said, although the
University can take such a mea
sure under two sets of cir
cumstances.
Furthest below targets
First, if the fraternity system
misses its overall quota for two
years in a row, the house furthest
below its target can be placed in
the draw. This provision does
not apply this year, though.
Second, if a fraternity per-

forms poorly for three off
consecutive years, it may
placed in the draw Perform
poorly means missing the qu
by more than 10 per cent i
year in which the fraternity|
tem makes its overall quota,
missing quota at all when
fraternity system does not n
its target.

tion, McCook added.
Past two years
Overall, fraternities were
asked to pledge 233 sophomore
equivalents, but pledged only
222 this spring, Hornbeak said.
In the past two years, the frater
nity system exceeded its quota
during spring rush.
A sophomore equivalent is a
person with two years of guaran
teed University housing remain
ing. A person with one year of

guaranteed housing remaining
counts as half a sophomore
equivalent.
The fraternity system will
probably meet its overall target
by October, Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of student affairs,
predicted. "But this won't help
some houses that are well below
quota," he added.
When the final results are
known, Hornbeak said, alumni
and administrators will consult
with officers of the frats below
quota to plan how those houses
will meet next year's require
ment.
'A bit complacent'
McCook predicted that frater
nities will meet next year's
quota, but said houses "might
have been a bit complacent" this
spring, since they had surpassed
their quota in spring 1976.
For this spring, Alpha Delta
Phi faced a target of 21.5 sopho
more equivalents, but had
pledged only 14 by May 19.
Theta Xi pledged only five
sophomore equivalents, with a
target of 12.5.
Both houses will need "spe
cial attention" next year,
Hornbeak said. "There's some
thing wrong when they miss
quota by that much," Robinson
added.
Other houses between 0.5 and
3.5 below quota were Beta Theta
Pi, Delta kappa Epsilon, Delta
Tau Delta, kappa Alpha, kappa
Sigma, Phi Delta Theta and
Theta Delta Chi.
Seven above quota
Delta Upsilon, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Chi and Zeta Psi
met their targets, with Sigma Chi
exceeding its quota b> seven.
"Sigma Chi was on the skids
about three or four years ago,"
Hornbeak said, "but it's really
rebuilt its popularity."
Fraternities may already have
pledged slightly more than 222
sophomore equivalents,
Hornbeak said, if "some

stragglers" chose to accept a
fraternity bid after May 19.
No fraternities are liable to be
placed in the draw next year,
Hornbeak said, although the
University can take such a mea
sure under two sets of cir
cumstances.
Furthest below targets
First, if the fraternity system
misses its overall quota for two
years in a row, the house furthest
below its target can be placed in
the draw. This provision does
not apply this year, though.
Second, if a fraternity per-

forms poorly for three off
consecutive years, it may
placed in the draw Perform
poorly means missing the qu
by more than 10 per cent i
year in which the fraternity|
tem makes its overall quota,
missing quota at all when
fraternity system does not n
its target.
Of the houses below qui
only the Alpha Delts misi
their quota b\ more than 10
cent last year. Hornbeak said
the Alpha Delts perform po<
in one of t he next two years.t
could be placed in the draw
Nine of the 13 fraternities here
did not meet their University
pledge quotas during spring
rush, according to Tom
Hornbeak, assistant row direc
tor. , , ...
As a result, fraternities will
probably step up their efforts to
rush transfer students in the fall,
said Peter McCook, vice presi
dent of the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC).
"I imagine a couple of houses
will be making an effort" to rush
transfer students, he said.
"Otherwise, they'll be stuck

with empty spaces."
The IFC will write to each
male transfer student, informing
him of the fraternity housing op
tion, McCook added.
