# University awaits impact of Bakke decision brief
## 
### 
After having helped prepare a brief on the Bakke
case for the U.S. Supreme Court, James Siena, legal
adviser to the president, said he hopes "the court
will be impressed by the seriousness with which
we view the case."
Siena and Iris Brest, associate staff legal counsel
here, joined with representatives from Columbia,
Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania to
prepare the brief.
Race must be taken into account for universities
to achieve racially diverse student bodies, the brief,
filed June 7, contends.
The Bakke case is on appeal from the Supreme
Court of California, which held that a special ad
missions program for minority students at the
UC-Davis Medical School was unconstitutional.
"Admissions decisions based on racially neutral
criteria, which take no account of the educational
deficit under which America's nonwhites have la
bored throughout our history, would not yield a
large enough number of minority students to
achieve substantial diversity," the brief contends.
"By making conscious efforts to include more
minority students in their undergraduate and pro
fessional programs, universities are better per
forming the function of providing tomorrow's
leaders," it continued.
"Stanford prepared the original outline of the
brief," Brest said. "It was then gone over by all
parties in several editing sessions. There were no
deep divisions, but there was a difference of em
phasis."
Few other colleges or universities have filed
briefs on Bakke, she said. Most briefs on the case
have come from bar associations or civil rights

groups, Brest remarked.
The U.S. Supreme Court will probably be
hearing the case this fall. Brest . ! -.1 though!
noted that no definite date has him set.
The brief asserts that if sioi
upheld, the decision "will pr* : t t.ii.av precli

programs which could sii'

The chief option prop:'--. ilifor

"If disadvantage is not tr 1 merely a
euphemism for race, a program Kir •ne disadv

minority applicants," the brief tin hired.
The brief also said universities regard mino
status as a favorable factor when deciding wh(
admit.
"The differences in experience that ariseou
growing up black or chicano or \mericanln
enable students who are members ot thesegro
to introduce into the university community im[
tant perceptions and understandings, the
contended.
Charles Meyers, dean of the law school here.i
signed the brief, but as an individual attorney
as dean or a representative ot his faculty.
