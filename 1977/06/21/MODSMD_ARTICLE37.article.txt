Locust swarming onto an Af

The film wanders aimlessly
from gimmick to gimmick in a
manner painfully reminiscent of
a Roadrunner cartoon. Com
pletely absent is the attention to
personalities which made Wil

Exorcist, such a success.
Instead, we get countless lo
cust shots, a great deal of zipping
across the globe and some tense
shouting matches.
But these cannot substitute for
an understanding of questions
such as why a priest (Richard
Burton) is losing his faith or why
a 17-year-old girl (Linda Blair) is
becoming a saint.
With so many areas like these
left unexplored, the movie is
hollow. It will titillate and it may

brand with her in all her other

Fletcher is able to overcome
only part of this image. And her
performance is further ham
pered because she must ad
minister a laughable imitation of
a psychiatric technique — syn
chronized hypnosis.
Blair's acting skills probably
rate as the best. But as a buxom
17-year-old, she cannot be as
poignant as she was four years
ago, when she was a young girl
possessed by the devil in the
Exorcist.
In fact, Blair's most effective
scenes are flashbacks to the time
of the original Exorcist, when
she lay in her bed, covered in
filth and in the clutches of the
devil.
The special effects in that

scene, and most others (except
for synchronized hypnotism) are
gripping, for at least a few mi
nutes. If locusts don't send you,
watch for the scene where Bur
ton must cross a bed of nails.
That moment is on a par with the
swiveling head atrocity of the
first Exorcist.
Few persons shop for films
solely on the strength of their at
rocities, though. Writer William
Goodhart and director John
Boorman both appear to think
they have gone beyond shockers
and produced a movie with a
message.
If there is a message to the
film, though, it can only be that
the movie industry is not vet wil
ling to tackle exorcism, heretics,
or such religious topics except
on a superficial level.

Fletcher is able to overcome
only part of this image. And her
performance is further ham

a psychiatric technique — syn
chronized hypnosis.
Blair's acting skills probably
rate as the best. But as a buxom
17-year-old, she cannot be as
poignant as she was four years
ago, when she was a young girl
possessed by the devil in the
Exorcist.
In fact, Blair's most effective
scenes are flashbacks to the time
of the original Exorcist, when
she lay in her bed, covered in
filth and in the clutches of the
devil.
The special effects in that

scene, and most others (except
for synchronized hypnotism) are
gripping, for at least a few mi
nutes. If locusts don't send you,
watch for the scene where Bur
ton must cross a bed of nails.
That moment is on a par with the
swiveling head atrocity of the
first Exorcist.
Few persons shop for films
solely on the strength of their at
rocities, though. Writer William
Goodhart and director John
Boorman both appear to think
they have gone beyond shockers
and produced a movie with a
message.
If there is a message to the
film, though, it can only be that
the movie industry is not vet wil
ling to tackle exorcism, heretics,
or such religious topics except
on a superficial level.
