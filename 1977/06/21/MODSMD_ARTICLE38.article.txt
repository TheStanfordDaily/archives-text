# 'A Bridge Too Far'/Jack Vaughn
## More guns, more bombs, more wa[Illegible] 
### 
What did A Bridge Too Far's
producer, Joseph E. Levine, get
for the $25 million of United Ar
tists' money he spent making the
movie? More tanks, more planes,
more bombs, more guns and
more parachutes than any
filmmaker before him.
On the human side, he got
more flying bodies, shrapnel
filled appendages, cratered
skulls and bloodstained civi
lians than ever before.
In short, he and director
Richard Attenborough have put
more of the sheer horror of war

into three hours of film than any
normal person could ask for. The
effect of the film, like the action
it depicts, is devastating.
The movie chronicles the ill
fated allied attempt in Sep
tember 1944 to leapfrog through
Holland to Germany by parat
roop assaults on six Dutch
highway bridges followed by
armored reinforcement. But it is
no anti-war statement.
Instead, it is a hard-hitting at
tack on getting beaten.
While somber notes are struck
as Maj. Gen. Robert Urquhart
(Sean Gonnery) and his parat
roop unit are being decimated by
two unexpected panzer divi
sions at Arnhem Bridge on the
Dutch-German border, the suc
cessful ground assault at the
next farthest bridge, Nijmegen.

is greeted with martial music as
spirited as any found in an army
indoctrination film.
Technically, A Bridge Too Far
is the World War II movie to end
them all. No more realistic battle
scenes have ever been filmed
and the parachute drop in to Ar
nhem is one of the screen's most
awesome events.
The main object of the film's
criticism, Field Marshal Bernard
Montgomery, is strangely ab
sent. Though it was Monty who
convinced Ike to attempt the as
sault, designed to end the war by
December, William Goldman's
script makes little attempt to
explain the lapse in judgment ot
either man.
But the cockiness of the
British command is well dis
