# Bryant and gays
## 
### 
The recent defeat of the Miami
anti-discrimination ordinance
concerning homosexuals is a
clear insult to the democratic
principles upon which America
is supposedly founded. While
constituting only a local defeat
for a repressed gay population
which has long sought accep
tance, it is likely to pave the way
for similar action across the na
tion.
Not only is the gay movement
failing to gain ground in its
struggle for equal rights, it ap
pears to be actually losing it.
California State Senator John
Briggs' proposed legislation
prohibiting homosexual
primary-school teachers is but
one recent example.
Although a confirmed Christ
ian heterosexual, I find it impos
sible to side with Anita Bryant
and her "Save the Children"
movement. From the standpoint
of human interaction, it is one
thing to ostracize an individual
for undesirable habits over
which he has control, yet quite
another when the personal flaw
is biological and not subject to
change. An employer may justly
fire a worker whose continual
absence is due to laziness, but
not one who is stricken with
serious illness.

Furthermore, although Bryant
claims that her battle against the
gays is a crusade for Jesus, her
attitudes can hardly be termed
Christian. She bases her argu
ment upon a single obscure
Bible passage, while at the same
time blatantly violating the love
and acceptance of fellow man
which constitutes the true Chris
tian ethic. More realistically,
Bryant might be justly criticized
lor using the gospel as a cover
up for persona] prejudices and
an inflated ego which is thriving
on recent nationwide publicity.
The Bryant campaign further
rationalizes itself as a movement
aimed at "Saving the Children."
Two facts delineate the absur
dity of this argument: first, chil
dren grow up and must ulti
mately cope with reality; and
second, gay people will cer-

David Sartoris \

tainly be a part of that reality. To
delay a child's awareness of the
existence of homosexuality is
only likely to perpetuate the
biases which currently hold the
gay population in suppression.
Clearly, Bryant's campaign
might be more accurately termed
"Deceiving the Children," and
vaguely resembles the concept
of Santa Claus.
Thus, it is clear that the recent
defeat of the anti-gay discrimi
nation bill in Miami and those
which will inevitably follow are
unfortunate events. They are
representative of the sad fact t hat
democracy and equality can still
be overcome by personal pre
judice.
If Anita Bryant's major goal is
indeed the welfare of American
children, she might better ac
complish it via a return to the
promotion of Florida orange
juice from the sunshine tree.

Thus, it is clear that the recent
defeat of the anti-gay discrimi
nation bill in Miami and those
which will inevitably follow are
unfortunate events. They are
representative of the sad fact t hat
democracy and equality can still
be overcome by personal pre
judice.

The recent defeat of the Miami
anti-discrimination ordinance
concerning homosexuals is a
clear insult to the democratic
principles upon which America
is supposedly founded. While
constituting only a local defeat
for a repressed gay population
which has long sought accep
tance, it is likely to pave the way
for similar action across the na
tion.
Not only is the gay movement
failing to gain ground in its
struggle for equal rights, it ap
pears to be actually losing it.
California State Senator John
Briggs' proposed legislation
prohibiting homosexual
primary-school teachers is but
one recent example.
Although a confirmed Christ
ian heterosexual, I find it impos
sible to side with Anita Bryant
and her "Save the Children"
movement. From the standpoint
of human interaction, it is one
thing to ostracize an individual
for undesirable habits over
which he has control, yet quite
another when the personal flaw
is biological and not subject to
change. An employer may justly
fire a worker whose continual
absence is due to laziness, but
not one who is stricken with
serious illness.

Furthermore, although Bryant
claims that her battle against the
gays is a crusade for Jesus, her
attitudes can hardly be termed
Christian. She bases her argu
ment upon a single obscure
Bible passage, while at the same
time blatantly violating the love
and acceptance of fellow man
which constitutes the true Chris
tian ethic. More realistically,
Bryant might be justly criticized
lor using the gospel as a cover
up for persona] prejudices and
an inflated ego which is thriving
on recent nationwide publicity.
The Bryant campaign further
rationalizes itself as a movement
aimed at "Saving the Children."
Two facts delineate the absur
dity of this argument: first, chil
dren grow up and must ulti
mately cope with reality; and
second, gay people will cer-

tainly be a part of that reality. To
delay a child's awareness of the
existence of homosexuality is
only likely to perpetuate the
biases which currently hold the
gay population in suppression.
Clearly, Bryant's campaign
might be more accurately termed
"Deceiving the Children," and
vaguely resembles the concept
of Santa Claus.
Thus, it is clear that the recent
defeat of the anti-gay discrimi
nation bill in Miami and those
which will inevitably follow are
unfortunate events. They are
representative of the sad fact t hat
democracy and equality can still
be overcome by personal pre
judice.
