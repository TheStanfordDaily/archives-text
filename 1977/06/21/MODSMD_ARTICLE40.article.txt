in George

Lucas' vision (Mark Hamill as a
half-farmboy half-defender of
galaxies, Carrie Fisher as a feisty
princess, and Harrison Ford as a
kind-hearted mercenary mur
derer) are deliberately aesthetic,
like Barbie dolls, or escapees
from an episode of Lu.vsie. They
speak in happy, vapid sentences,
with clean faces and white teeth,
and as they speak they defuse
what could have been a very
powerful movie.
This does not mean that Lucas
should be faulted for avoiding
the asinine political commen
tary implicit in movies like Rol
lerhall, or Logon's Hun. For that
he deserves the highest praise.
Unfortunately, the decision to
center the action around the
aforementioned members of the
I'epsi generation does more than
eliminate the possibility of Hilly

Jockism s.
Because it encourages what
can only be described as bad act
ing, it demystifies the wizardry
with which Hamill and Guin
ness preserve the forces of good.
True 2001 fans tell me that
Star Wars, for all its visual
achievements is really very
bland — even though I still don't
know what the hell was going on
in Kubrick's movie 1 am tempted
to agree.
There is a fine line between
schlock and substance, and Star
Wars is essentially a tightrope
act. Because it is technically
superior, it is a movie not to be
missed; because it is internally
vacuous, representing a pro
foundly law appraisal of
movie-goer's intelligence, it
should not be enshrined.
