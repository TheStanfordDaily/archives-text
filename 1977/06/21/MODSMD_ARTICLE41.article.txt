## Sky's the limit

It's cold and gray, jets rumble and cars honk. The open air eats
much of the play's music and subtleties. Stanford Barn's courtyard
doesn't quite work for The Fantasticks.
The Theatre Works' simple just-for-fun production lets the audi
ence sip wine by candlelight while seated cabaret style around a
platform stage.
This outdoor setting may add "atmosphere" but it dampens the
show. Because of the open stage and cold weather, the singing
sounds "off" and at times uncoordinated with the orchestra. Much of
the play's wry humor is lost to the sky.
What comes through is director Robin Miller's enjoyable but un
even version of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's tale about adoles
cent love.
Though the first act is rough, Act II settles into that sugary make
believe world which The Funtasticks lovingly parodies.
The actors, choppy in the beginning, grow more comfortable after
the intermission, especially David Bryant's El Gallo. Luisa (Corie
Burdick) and Matt (Tim Cole), the young lovers, arj a little too
wide-eyed throughout the show. Their fathers (Tim Enos and Roger
Scoggs) play straight for laughs but neither projects enough to carry
the vaudeville lines.
Paul Edwards' tottering actor-past-his-prime is easily the most
polished and fluid character. Mortimer (Deena Freeman) and The
Mute (Greg Woodward) win the audience with their mime, though
Mortimer gets too carried away with his rubbery routines.
The warm simplicity of Bruce McLeod's set and lighting design
and Elisabeth Roberts costumes work well.
The Fantasticks runs June 23, 24, 25, July 1 and 2.


It depends on what you pay
David Bryant (center) bargains with Tim Enos and Roger
Scoggs as the three plot to bring together young lovers in The
Theatre Works' outdoor production of The Fantasticks.
