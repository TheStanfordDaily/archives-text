Quake strikes near Livermore
A moderate earthquake occurred at
7:43 p.m. yesterday near Livermore. The
epicenter was six miles east of the city,
and the quake was felt in an area at least
60 miles in diameter.
The quake registered 4.7 on the Richter
scale. The last quake of that magnitude
was on lan. 8. in the hills east of Berkeley.
Idi Amin reported missing
An attempt was made to assassinate
Ugandan President Idi Amin during the
weekend and reports that the dictator has
disappeared surfaced in the Nairobi
newspaper The Nation yesterday.
Amin, who has survived many assassi
nation attempts since seizing power more
than six years ago, was attacked by two
gunmen who sprayed his car with bullets
Saturday morning, the newspaper said.
Yet reports remained confusing. One
diplomatic source said that Amin's car
was not involved in a shooting. However,
on the telephone, one Ugandan govern
ment official said, "We do not know
where the president is."
"Something appears to have hap
pened," diplomatic sources said in con
firming there was a shooting incident
Saturday near the spot The Nation cited,
but whether it involved Amin was uncer
tain.
In their late afternoon news yesterday,
Radio Uganda refrained from mentioning
Amin's name. Over the weekend they had
broadcast routine stories about Amin.
The Nation quoted Ugandan Vice Pres
ident Mustafa Adrisi as saying, "If you
find him. please contact Uganda im
mediately."
The newspaper The Nation has been a
strong critic of Amin and has often re
ported incidents which were never ver
ified.
Equal school funding upheld
The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday left
standing a 1976 decision by theCalifornia
Supreme Court which had declared
California's public school financing sys
tem a violation of the state constitution.

Originally, the California Supreme
Court held that the system violated both
state and federal constitutional guaran
tees of equal protection of t he law for all.
Yet later, in a similar Texas case, the
U.S. Supreme Court said the U.S. Con
stitution permits such a system.
So by refusing to involve itself in this
California case, the Court leaves the mat
ter up to the state.
The court's decision "doesn't change
anything and that's fine," said Terry
McHenry, assistant superintendent for
business and administration of the Santa
Clara County schools office.
"The court has already said school
financing is the state's problem and the
state is going to solve it."
The public school financing system
permits wealthy school districts to pro
vide more funds for education by employ
ing additional taxes for schools beyond
the basic state program.
In a 4-3 decision, the California Sup
reme Court found impermissible the con
ditioning of educational opportunity on
the property wealth of the district in
which the student lives.
The decision requires a revision in the
property tax financing of schools so that
the same tax dollars will generate the
same spending per pupil. It affects the
distribution of approximately $7 billion
annually for California's 4.5 million
school age children.
Oil flows in Alaskan pipeline
Hot oil from the North Slope of Alaska
began its long journey to the port of Val
dez, Alaska, through the $7.7 billion
trans-Alaska pipeline yesterday.
The 799-mile pipe took nine years in
planning and building and is the most
expensive project ever undertaken by
private industry.
At 1.1 miles per hour, it will take about
30 to 40 days for the oil to travel from
Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean to the

ice-free port of Valdez on Prince William
Sound.
Officials expect 1.2 million barrels of
oil a day to be flowing through the
pipeline soon. This would be about 15 per
cent of America's domestic crude oil re
quirements.
The pipeline was designed, built and
will be operated by Alyeska Pipeline Ser
vice Co. a consortium of eight oil com
panies.
"We've done a . . . good job." said Wil
liam Darch, president of Alyeska. "Our
destiny is in our hands. The problems are
now ours to solve, which is a very good
position to be in after the last couple
years."
At Valdez, oil will be pumped into tan
kers, but from there its destination is not
known. Refineries on the West Coast are
not designed to handle the high-sulfer oil
from Prudhoe Bay. Proposals for the oil
have ranged from sending it to the East
Coast via Panama or pipeline, to ar
rangements for trading with other na
tions.
Califano attacks health care
The Carter Administration will control
health care even if the American Medical
Association (AMA) will not cooperate,
HEW Secretary Joseph Califano told the
AMA yesterday.
Addressing the AMA's 126 th annual
convention, Califano said the health care
industry is monopolistic, inefficient and
poorly organized.
He said Carter was willing to reor
ganize the system by emphasizing pre
vention over acute care and by modifying
national health insurance to reduce what
he called unfairly-distributed patient
costs.
Health care is the third largest business
in the country, Califano pointed out, with
virtually no competition among doctors
and hospitals and with relatively little
among drugmakers.

He blamed this setup for "a j
economically classic structural]
lems" including tht- unfairdistributj
health resources; the inefficientorga
tion of physicians an>i other trainee
sonnel; and"the expensive and in«
ble crazy quilt' system of Ama
health insurance.
The AMA's outgoing presii
Richard Palmer issued a statementv
said doctors consider costs as onep
the larger health care battle.
Palmer said concentration on fini
problems would !• to unfortunat
tioning of medical treatment.

The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday left
standing a 1976 decision by theCalifornia
Supreme Court which had declared
California's public school financing sys
tem a violation of the state constitution.

Originally, the California Supreme
Court held that the system violated both
state and federal constitutional guaran
tees of equal protection of t he law for all.
Yet later, in a similar Texas case, the
U.S. Supreme Court said the U.S. Con
stitution permits such a system.
So by refusing to involve itself in this
California case, the Court leaves the mat
ter up to the state.
The court's decision "doesn't change
anything and that's fine," said Terry
McHenry, assistant superintendent for
business and administration of the Santa
Clara County schools office.
"The court has already said school
financing is the state's problem and the
state is going to solve it."
The public school financing system
permits wealthy school districts to pro
vide more funds for education by employ
ing additional taxes for schools beyond
the basic state program.
In a 4-3 decision, the California Sup
reme Court found impermissible the con
ditioning of educational opportunity on
the property wealth of the district in
which the student lives.
The decision requires a revision in the
property tax financing of schools so that
the same tax dollars will generate the
same spending per pupil. It affects the
distribution of approximately $7 billion
annually for California's 4.5 million
school age children.
Oil flows in Alaskan pipeline
Hot oil from the North Slope of Alaska
began its long journey to the port of Val
dez, Alaska, through the $7.7 billion
trans-Alaska pipeline yesterday.
The 799-mile pipe took nine years in
planning and building and is the most
expensive project ever undertaken by
private industry.
At 1.1 miles per hour, it will take about
30 to 40 days for the oil to travel from
Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean to the

ice-free port of Valdez on Prince William
Sound.
Officials expect 1.2 million barrels of
oil a day to be flowing through the
pipeline soon. This would be about 15 per
cent of America's domestic crude oil re
quirements.
The pipeline was designed, built and
will be operated by Alyeska Pipeline Ser
vice Co. a consortium of eight oil com
panies.
"We've done a . . . good job." said Wil
liam Darch, president of Alyeska. "Our
destiny is in our hands. The problems are
now ours to solve, which is a very good
position to be in after the last couple
years."
At Valdez, oil will be pumped into tan
kers, but from there its destination is not
known. Refineries on the West Coast are
not designed to handle the high-sulfer oil
from Prudhoe Bay. Proposals for the oil
have ranged from sending it to the East
Coast via Panama or pipeline, to ar
rangements for trading with other na
tions.
Califano attacks health care
The Carter Administration will control
health care even if the American Medical
Association (AMA) will not cooperate,
HEW Secretary Joseph Califano told the
AMA yesterday.
Addressing the AMA's 126 th annual
convention, Califano said the health care
industry is monopolistic, inefficient and
poorly organized.
He said Carter was willing to reor
ganize the system by emphasizing pre
vention over acute care and by modifying
national health insurance to reduce what
he called unfairly-distributed patient
costs.
Health care is the third largest business
in the country, Califano pointed out, with
virtually no competition among doctors
and hospitals and with relatively little
among drugmakers.

He blamed this setup for "a j
economically classic structural]
lems" including tht- unfairdistributj
health resources; the inefficientorga
tion of physicians an>i other trainee
sonnel; and"the expensive and in«
ble crazy quilt' system of Ama
health insurance.
The AMA's outgoing presii
Richard Palmer issued a statementv
said doctors consider costs as onep
the larger health care battle.
Palmer said concentration on fini
problems would !• to unfortunat

Idi Amin reported missing
An attempt was made to assassinate
Ugandan President Idi Amin during the
weekend and reports that the dictator has
disappeared surfaced in the Nairobi
newspaper The Nation yesterday.
Amin, who has survived many assassi
nation attempts since seizing power more
than six years ago, was attacked by two
gunmen who sprayed his car with bullets
Saturday morning, the newspaper said.
Yet reports remained confusing. One
diplomatic source said that Amin's car
was not involved in a shooting. However,
on the telephone, one Ugandan govern
ment official said, "We do not know
where the president is."
"Something appears to have hap
pened," diplomatic sources said in con
firming there was a shooting incident
Saturday near the spot The Nation cited,
but whether it involved Amin was uncer

In their late afternoon news yesterday,
Radio Uganda refrained from mentioning
Amin's name. Over the weekend they had
broadcast routine stories about Amin.
The Nation quoted Ugandan Vice Pres

The newspaper The Nation has been a

trans-Alaska pipeline yesterday.
The 799-mile pipe took nine years in
planning and building and is the most
expensive project ever undertaken by
private industry.
At 1.1 miles per hour, it will take about
30 to 40 days for the oil to travel from
Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean to the

ice-free port of Valdez on Prince William
Sound.
Officials expect 1.2 million barrels of
oil a day to be flowing through the
pipeline soon. This would be about 15 per
cent of America's domestic crude oil re
quirements.
The pipeline was designed, built and
will be operated by Alyeska Pipeline Ser
vice Co. a consortium of eight oil com
panies.
"We've done a . . . good job." said Wil
liam Darch, president of Alyeska. "Our
destiny is in our hands. The problems are
now ours to solve, which is a very good
position to be in after the last couple
years."
At Valdez, oil will be pumped into tan
kers, but from there its destination is not
known. Refineries on the West Coast are
not designed to handle the high-sulfer oil
from Prudhoe Bay. Proposals for the oil
have ranged from sending it to the East
Coast via Panama or pipeline, to ar
rangements for trading with other na
tions.
Califano attacks health care
The Carter Administration will control
health care even if the American Medical
Association (AMA) will not cooperate,
HEW Secretary Joseph Califano told the
AMA yesterday.
Addressing the AMA's 126 th annual
convention, Califano said the health care
industry is monopolistic, inefficient and
poorly organized.
He said Carter was willing to reor
ganize the system by emphasizing pre
vention over acute care and by modifying
national health insurance to reduce what
he called unfairly-distributed patient
costs.
Health care is the third largest business
in the country, Califano pointed out, with
virtually no competition among doctors
and hospitals and with relatively little
among drugmakers.

He blamed this setup for "a j
economically classic structural]
lems" including tht- unfairdistributj
health resources; the inefficientorga
tion of physicians an>i other trainee
sonnel; and"the expensive and in«
ble crazy quilt' system of Ama
health insurance.
The AMA's outgoing presii
Richard Palmer issued a statementv
said doctors consider costs as onep
the larger health care battle.
Palmer said concentration on fini
problems would !• to unfortunat
tioning of medical treatment.

Quake strikes near Livermore
A moderate earthquake occurred at
7:43 p.m. yesterday near Livermore. The
epicenter was six miles east of the city,
and the quake was felt in an area at least
60 miles in diameter.
The quake registered 4.7 on the Richter
scale. The last quake of that magnitude
was on lan. 8. in the hills east of Berkeley.
Idi Amin reported missing
An attempt was made to assassinate
Ugandan President Idi Amin during the
weekend and reports that the dictator has
disappeared surfaced in the Nairobi
newspaper The Nation yesterday.
Amin, who has survived many assassi
nation attempts since seizing power more
than six years ago, was attacked by two
gunmen who sprayed his car with bullets
Saturday morning, the newspaper said.
Yet reports remained confusing. One
diplomatic source said that Amin's car
was not involved in a shooting. However,
on the telephone, one Ugandan govern
ment official said, "We do not know
where the president is."
"Something appears to have hap
pened," diplomatic sources said in con
firming there was a shooting incident
Saturday near the spot The Nation cited,
but whether it involved Amin was uncer
tain.
In their late afternoon news yesterday,
Radio Uganda refrained from mentioning
Amin's name. Over the weekend they had
broadcast routine stories about Amin.
The Nation quoted Ugandan Vice Pres
ident Mustafa Adrisi as saying, "If you
find him. please contact Uganda im
mediately."
The newspaper The Nation has been a
strong critic of Amin and has often re
ported incidents which were never ver
ified.
Equal school funding upheld
The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday left
standing a 1976 decision by theCalifornia
Supreme Court which had declared
California's public school financing sys
tem a violation of the state constitution.

Originally, the California Supreme
Court held that the system violated both
state and federal constitutional guaran
tees of equal protection of t he law for all.
Yet later, in a similar Texas case, the
U.S. Supreme Court said the U.S. Con
stitution permits such a system.
So by refusing to involve itself in this
California case, the Court leaves the mat
ter up to the state.
The court's decision "doesn't change
anything and that's fine," said Terry
McHenry, assistant superintendent for
business and administration of the Santa
Clara County schools office.
"The court has already said school
financing is the state's problem and the
state is going to solve it."
The public school financing system
permits wealthy school districts to pro
vide more funds for education by employ
ing additional taxes for schools beyond
the basic state program.
In a 4-3 decision, the California Sup
reme Court found impermissible the con
ditioning of educational opportunity on
the property wealth of the district in
which the student lives.
The decision requires a revision in the
property tax financing of schools so that
the same tax dollars will generate the
same spending per pupil. It affects the
distribution of approximately $7 billion
annually for California's 4.5 million
school age children.
