# Defense of Humphrey-Hawkins
## 
### 
With a few errors and almost
total misconception, Doug Ban
dow tried to ridicule to death the
Full Employment and Balanced
Growth Act of 1977 (H.R.50-
5.50) — better known as the
Humphrey-Hawkins full
employment bill (Daily. May
25).
Apparently Bandow did not
realize that there have been four
versions of the bill since Rep.
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Calif.)
first introduced the measure in
Congress in June 1974. The
guarantee" of a job for Ameri
cans willing and able to work
was deleted from the third ver
sion of the bill which was intro
duced in Congress in March
1976.
In order to dispel Bandow's
misconception, it is necessary to
try to summarize a 56-page bill.
It is designed to cut the rate of
inflation and the high un
employment rate to three per
cent of the adult work force 2fJ

years and over within four years
— or to about four per cent of the
entire work force — and eventu
ally to end involuntary un
employment.
It requires the president, after
consultation with his Council of
Economic Advisers, to present
annually to Congress his inten
tions for the coming year on
money supply and interest rates.
Congress would have to con
sider the president's proposal
and act on it.
It is not a bill directed against
business as Bandow assumes. In
fact, it is pro-business. To ensure
the achievement of the full
employment goal, the legisla
tion authorizes the president to
establish supplementary, last re
sort jobs. That would occur if,
and only if, the monetary and
fiscal efforts of the president,
Congress and the Federal Re
serve Uoard failed to encourage
business to achieve economic
goals over a period of two years
that are consistent with the over
all four-year employment target
goal.
Bandow's worry over business
competing with the government
for jobs was answered by Secret
ary of Labor Ray Marshall in an
article on the full employment
bill written for The AFL-CIO
American Federationist last
August.
Marshall, who would ad
minister the law should it be
enacted, said that there is little
likelihood that workers would
leave good private jobs with
seniority and other benefits"
for public employment jobs. It
could be made a condition that a
worker would have to lose his
job for reasons beyond his con
trol before he could accept a pub

lic employment job, Marshall
wrote.
He added, "the prevailing
wage rates (for public employ
ment) mentioned in the full
employment bill, need not be
union wages, but might be jobs
at or near the minimum wage."
I don't know where Bandow
got his $30 billion figure for pub
lic jobs' expenditures. The Con
gressional Budget Office (CBO)
estimated that a two million
"last resort" job program would
cost $16 billion to $27 billion —
only four to seven per cent of the
fiscal 1976 spending, according
to Markley Roberts, an AFL-CIO
economist.
"But with more people work
ing, earning income and spend
ing money, the economy will
operate at higher levels,"
Roberts said. "There is a 'multip
lier' effect. Bigger business pro
fits and higher personal income
results in more tax revenues."
"CBO declared that 'after 24
months of operation, the budget
costs amount to about a third of
the program outlays.' The esti
mate of between $16 billion and
$27 billion, therefore, would be
reduced by two-thirds," Roberts
said. He contended that even
these estimates are high because
good planning and well coordi
nated fiscal and monetary
policies will create jobs in the
private sector, thus reducing the
need for "last resort" jobs.
Bandow attributed to CBO a
statement that Humphrey-
Hawkins poses the threat of in
flation, but Marshall quoted the
same source as an argument for
public employment. The latter
wrote, ". . . public employment
is the cheapest and therefore the
least inflationary way to reduce

Frederick Ross

unemployment. Forexamplet
CBO estimates the annual cost
creating a job through pu
employment would be mu
less than the cost per joboiat
Obviously, Marshall did«
look with favor on tax cuts as
means of stimulating enl P
ment as proposed by Kep a
Kemp (R-N.V.) in the Job Cre
tion Act which is favored
Bandow.

only four to seven per cent of the
fiscal 1976 spending, according
to Markley Roberts, an AFL-CIO
economist.
"But with more people work
ing, earning income and spend
ing money, the economy will
operate at higher levels,"
Roberts said. "There is a 'multip
lier' effect. Bigger business pro
fits and higher personal income
results in more tax revenues."
"CBO declared that 'after 24
months of operation, the budget
costs amount to about a third of
the program outlays.' The esti
mate of between $16 billion and
$27 billion, therefore, would be
reduced by two-thirds," Roberts
said. He contended that even
these estimates are high because
good planning and well coordi
nated fiscal and monetary
policies will create jobs in the
private sector, thus reducing the
need for "last resort" jobs.
Bandow attributed to CBO a
statement that Humphrey-
Hawkins poses the threat of in
flation, but Marshall quoted the
same source as an argument for
public employment. The latter
wrote, ". . . public employment
is the cheapest and therefore the
least inflationary way to reduce

unemployment. Forexamplet

With a few errors and almost

Humphrey-Hawkins full

25).
Apparently Bandow did not
realize that there have been four
versions of the bill since Rep.
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Calif.)
first introduced the measure in
Congress in June 1974. The
guarantee" of a job for Ameri
cans willing and able to work
was deleted from the third ver
sion of the bill which was intro
duced in Congress in March
1976.
In order to dispel Bandow's
misconception, it is necessary to
try to summarize a 56-page bill.
It is designed to cut the rate of
inflation and the high un
employment rate to three per
cent of the adult work force 2fJ

years and over within four years
— or to about four per cent of the
entire work force — and eventu
ally to end involuntary un
employment.
It requires the president, after
consultation with his Council of
Economic Advisers, to present
annually to Congress his inten

money supply and interest rates.
Congress would have to con
sider the president's proposal
and act on it.
It is not a bill directed against
business as Bandow assumes. In
fact, it is pro-business. To ensure
the achievement of the full
employment goal, the legisla
tion authorizes the president to
establish supplementary, last re
sort jobs. That would occur if,
and only if, the monetary and
fiscal efforts of the president,
Congress and the Federal Re
serve Uoard failed to encourage
business to achieve economic
goals over a period of two years
that are consistent with the over
all four-year employment target
goal.
Bandow's worry over business
competing with the government
for jobs was answered by Secret
ary of Labor Ray Marshall in an
article on the full employment
bill written for The AFL-CIO
American Federationist last
August.
Marshall, who would ad
minister the law should it be
enacted, said that there is little
likelihood that workers would
leave good private jobs with
seniority and other benefits"
for public employment jobs. It
could be made a condition that a
worker would have to lose his
job for reasons beyond his con
trol before he could accept a pub

lic employment job, Marshall
wrote.
He added, "the prevailing
wage rates (for public employ
ment) mentioned in the full
employment bill, need not be
union wages, but might be jobs
at or near the minimum wage."
I don't know where Bandow
got his $30 billion figure for pub
lic jobs' expenditures. The Con
gressional Budget Office (CBO)
estimated that a two million
"last resort" job program would
cost $16 billion to $27 billion —
only four to seven per cent of the
fiscal 1976 spending, according
to Markley Roberts, an AFL-CIO
economist.
"But with more people work

Humphrey-Hawkins full
employment bill (Daily. May
25).
Apparently Bandow did not
realize that there have been four
versions of the bill since Rep.
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Calif.)
first introduced the measure in
Congress in June 1974. The
guarantee" of a job for Ameri
cans willing and able to work
was deleted from the third ver
sion of the bill which was intro
duced in Congress in March
1976.
In order to dispel Bandow's
misconception, it is necessary to
try to summarize a 56-page bill.
It is designed to cut the rate of
inflation and the high un
employment rate to three per
cent of the adult work force 2fJ

years and over within four years
— or to about four per cent of the
entire work force — and eventu
ally to end involuntary un
employment.
It requires the president, after
consultation with his Council of
Economic Advisers, to present
annually to Congress his inten
tions for the coming year on
money supply and interest rates.
Congress would have to con
sider the president's proposal
and act on it.
It is not a bill directed against
business as Bandow assumes. In
fact, it is pro-business. To ensure
the achievement of the full
employment goal, the legisla
tion authorizes the president to
establish supplementary, last re
sort jobs. That would occur if,
and only if, the monetary and
fiscal efforts of the president,
Congress and the Federal Re
serve Uoard failed to encourage
business to achieve economic
goals over a period of two years
that are consistent with the over
all four-year employment target
goal.
Bandow's worry over business
competing with the government
for jobs was answered by Secret
ary of Labor Ray Marshall in an
article on the full employment
bill written for The AFL-CIO
American Federationist last
August.
Marshall, who would ad
minister the law should it be
enacted, said that there is little
likelihood that workers would
leave good private jobs with
seniority and other benefits"
for public employment jobs. It
could be made a condition that a
worker would have to lose his
job for reasons beyond his con
trol before he could accept a pub

lic employment job, Marshall
wrote.
He added, "the prevailing
wage rates (for public employ
ment) mentioned in the full
employment bill, need not be
union wages, but might be jobs
at or near the minimum wage."
I don't know where Bandow
got his $30 billion figure for pub
lic jobs' expenditures. The Con
gressional Budget Office (CBO)
estimated that a two million
"last resort" job program would
cost $16 billion to $27 billion —
only four to seven per cent of the
fiscal 1976 spending, according
to Markley Roberts, an AFL-CIO
economist.
"But with more people work
ing, earning income and spend
ing money, the economy will
operate at higher levels,"
Roberts said. "There is a 'multip
lier' effect. Bigger business pro
fits and higher personal income
results in more tax revenues."
"CBO declared that 'after 24
months of operation, the budget
costs amount to about a third of
the program outlays.' The esti
mate of between $16 billion and
$27 billion, therefore, would be
reduced by two-thirds," Roberts
said. He contended that even
these estimates are high because
good planning and well coordi
nated fiscal and monetary
policies will create jobs in the
private sector, thus reducing the
need for "last resort" jobs.
Bandow attributed to CBO a
statement that Humphrey-
Hawkins poses the threat of in
flation, but Marshall quoted the
same source as an argument for
public employment. The latter
wrote, ". . . public employment
is the cheapest and therefore the
least inflationary way to reduce

Frederick Ross

unemployment. Forexamplet
CBO estimates the annual cost
creating a job through pu
employment would be mu
less than the cost per joboiat
Obviously, Marshall did«
look with favor on tax cuts as
means of stimulating enl P
ment as proposed by Kep a
Kemp (R-N.V.) in the Job Cre
tion Act which is favored
Bandow.

total misconception, Doug Ban
