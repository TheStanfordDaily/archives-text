incement speaker.
lis June 12 address, the
sity of Chicago historian
he "long, nightmarish
path" to achieve educational
ly has yielded only the
:hance to "secure an edu
i that is mediocre or
(lamed this on public re
ice to break socio
nic barriers and to correct
ii distribution of funds.
Mows "the few schools
e good to remain good,
'he many that are poor re

an awesome responsibil
fighting the nation's edu

Franklin attacked opponents
of forced busing and school en
trance quotas. "The enrollment
in the past of no women and no
blacks . . . was as much a quota
system as any current suggestion
of numbers. . . . Quotas are not
new any more than busing for
racial purposes."
"One cannot imagine how
much time and energy, and . . .
resources are expended in the ef
fort to maintain such
euphemisms as freedom of
choice, neighborhood schools,
freedom from forced busing, and
cultural pluralism," he said.
"Entirely forgotten are the
princip'es of equal rights, justice
and tne future well-being of the
country."
Unwillingness denounced
Franklin denounced "the un
willingness of the American
people to do anything substan
tial to improve educational con
ditions across the land.
"Who in the world would be
lieve that the richest nation in
the world — a country known for
its generosity — would be un
able to find money to educate its
children," he asked.
Inadequate financing has
forced school officials to face
negotiations with powerful
teachers' unions; lack of funds
for proper school operation; and
what Franklin called "an atmos
phere hostile to the educative
process."
"If you know how destructive
a faulty educational system can
be to the social fabric, then you
must surely want to do some
thing about an enterprise in
which you have invested so
heavily," Franklin said.
He told his audience to fight
for equalized educational oppor
tunities because "it is as impor
tant to have excellent schools in
East Palo Alto as it is to have
them in Portola Valley.
