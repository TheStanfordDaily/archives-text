# Fiscal problems, S. Africa
## Massy looks at new post 
### Karen Wada 
Business Prut. William Massy,
vice provost tor research, said he
will face increasing energy costs
and the South Africa investment
controversy when he becomes
vice president for business and
finance in mid-September.
Massy. 43, succeeds Robert
Augsberger. who leaves office
June 30. Assoc. Vice President
and Controller Kenneth
Creighton will serve during the
interim.
Calling rising utility bills "our
biggest financial problem,"
Massy said he has not yet found a
solution.
While paying the bills is a fi
nancial puzzle, "South Africa is
more of a public relations prob
lem," he said. He added that his
experience as vice provost for re
search has prepared him for de
aling with such issues.
Controversies
Since he became vice provost
in 1971. he has dealt with con
troversies caused by Vietnam
related research, recombinant

DNA experiments, research
done for Iran by faculty members
and restriction of faculty rights
to consult for private groups.
To handle these problems.
Massy said he has needed to be
the liaison between the Univer
sity and the community, bet
ween the faculty and foreign
governments, and between re
searcher;; and sponsors.
In the recombinant DNA case,
he set up a committee to evaluate
the experiments, promoted pub
lic hearings, conducted safety
inspections and made the offi
cial decision to continue the ex
periments.
Massy said he plans to de
velop in full force his own ver
sion of model economics for
universities when he assumes
his new post.
Models
He said his models represent
"aspects of the University — fi
nances, structures, costs. From
them we see what happens if we
make certain changes."
"The main purposes are to
trace implications. . .and to find
tradeoffs — what changes in

planning factors and how much
of these changes is needed to
solve our problems."
Nationally acclaimed for his
work in fiscal planning, Massy
admits, "I've been a modeler vir
tually all of my career. I'd done it
in business for 10 to 12 years and
while sitting in on University
budget discussions, I began to
think about doing the same at
that level."
He said his studies have
helped Stanford stand in the
"advance guard" of research on
college funding. "We're leaders
in our specific area," he said,
"because we've developed
things which no one else has
tried.
"We're helping other schools
(including Harvard) to use this
system to see if it really works."
Degrees of freedom
Though models do not give
specific answers, Massy said
they "tell us what degrees of
freedom we have financially.
They also project what future
years hold." This, he said, "is
vital because we can't just solve
