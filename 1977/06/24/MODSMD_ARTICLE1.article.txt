# Fiscal problems, S. Africa
## Massy looks at new post 
### Karen Wada 
Business Prut. William Massy,
vice provost tor research, said he
will face increasing energy costs
and the South Africa investment
controversy when he becomes
vice president for business and
finance in mid-September.
Massy. 43, succeeds Robert
Augsberger. who leaves office
June 30. Assoc. Vice President
and Controller Kenneth
Creighton will serve during the
interim.
Calling rising utility bills "our
biggest financial problem,"
Massy said he has not yet found a
solution.
While paying the bills is a fi
nancial puzzle, "South Africa is
more of a public relations prob
lem," he said. He added that his
experience as vice provost for re
search has prepared him for de
aling with such issues.
Controversies
Since he became vice provost
in 1971. he has dealt with con
troversies caused by Vietnam
related research, recombinant

DNA experiments, research
done for Iran by faculty members
and restriction of faculty rights
to consult for private groups.
To handle these problems.
Massy said he has needed to be
the liaison between the Univer
sity and the community, bet
ween the faculty and foreign
governments, and between re
searcher;; and sponsors.
In the recombinant DNA case,
he set up a committee to evaluate
the experiments, promoted pub
lic hearings, conducted safety
inspections and made the offi
cial decision to continue the ex
periments.
Massy said he plans to de
velop in full force his own ver
sion of model economics for
universities when he assumes
his new post.
Models
He said his models represent
"aspects of the University — fi
nances, structures, costs. From
them we see what happens if we
make certain changes."
"The main purposes are to
trace implications. . .and to find
tradeoffs — what changes in

planning factors and how much
of these changes is needed to
solve our problems."
Nationally acclaimed for his
work in fiscal planning, Massy
admits, "I've been a modeler vir
tually all of my career. I'd done it
in business for 10 to 12 years and
while sitting in on University
budget discussions, I began to
think about doing the same at
that level."
He said his studies have
helped Stanford stand in the
"advance guard" of research on
college funding. "We're leaders
in our specific area," he said,
"because we've developed
things which no one else has
tried.
"We're helping other schools
(including Harvard) to use this
system to see if it really works."
Degrees of freedom
Though models do not give
specific answers, Massy said
they "tell us what degrees of
freedom we have financially.
They also project what future
years hold." This, he said, "is
vital because we can't just solve


William Massy
for this year."
His modeling system is
adapted from industrial
techniques, "changed quite a
bit" because universities and
corporations have different fi
nancial strategies.
In business, Massy said the
"name of the game is earning
money. The private interest
dominates and the personality of
the company reflects this. The
objective is to produce a profit
which goes to the owners, even if
they are removed from the or
ganization itself."
Universities are public
interest-dominated with what
Massy calls qualitative and in
tangible criteria for success.
"The values of Stanford involve
teaching, research, quality more
than quantity. It's a whole host of
things where no one group's
values ought to dominate, con
trary to business where stoc
kholders' interests do."
Public sentiment
Stanford trustees interpret
public sentiment rather than
create their own financial
policies, he explained. "It's not
so much what Bill Massy says, or
what President Richard Lyman
says that's right. It's what we in
terpret as the public good."
Hut Massy admits balancing
faculty, student and alumni in
terests is difficult. The Univer
sity budget, for example, is "in
tellectually difficult to ba
lance. . . It's a lot harder than it
used to be because government
support is down and the
economic environment is more

adverse than it used to be.
"In the long run, the major
problem is bow to make the
tradeoff between higher tuition
and academic resources," he
said. "Should we hold down
academic growth and therefore
tuition? he asked. "We must
make a decision about our inten
tions and responsibilities."
The relationship between
Stanford's educational produc
tivity and its financial statusalso
troubles Massy. "Ironically, the
better we do our job, the worse
off we are." He pointed out that
colleges must operate in markets
dominated by wage and price
rates which rise as graduates'
productivity increases.
The more productive schools
are, the higher their bills, Massy
said.
To fight greater costs, he said
the University is investing
"carefully" and is saving more of
its endowment investments re
turns than before the modeling
began.
"We also became interested in
a lot of investment ideas — but as
luck had it the stock market
crashed in 1974 and we've had to
start the planning over."
Besides fiscal planning,
Massy will supervise University
operations, support services (h
-ousing, personnel, food service)
and accounting control. He will
also handle relations with local
governments and Stanford ten
ants (industrial park and Stan
ford Shopping Center leases).
Despite the range of respon
sibilities, Massy does not con
sider the job unmanageable.

which goes to the owners, even if
they are removed from the or
ganization itself."
Universities are public
interest-dominated with what
Massy calls qualitative and in
tangible criteria for success.
"The values of Stanford involve
teaching, research, quality more
than quantity. It's a whole host of
things where no one group's
values ought to dominate, con
trary to business where stoc
kholders' interests do."
Public sentiment
Stanford trustees interpret
public sentiment rather than
create their own financial
policies, he explained. "It's not
so much what Bill Massy says, or
what President Richard Lyman
says that's right. It's what we in
terpret as the public good."
Hut Massy admits balancing
faculty, student and alumni in
terests is difficult. The Univer
sity budget, for example, is "in
tellectually difficult to ba
lance. . . It's a lot harder than it
used to be because government
support is down and the
economic environment is more

adverse than it used to be.
"In the long run, the major
problem is bow to make the
tradeoff between higher tuition
and academic resources," he
said. "Should we hold down
academic growth and therefore
tuition? he asked. "We must
make a decision about our inten
tions and responsibilities."
The relationship between
Stanford's educational produc
tivity and its financial statusalso
troubles Massy. "Ironically, the
better we do our job, the worse
off we are." He pointed out that
colleges must operate in markets
dominated by wage and price
rates which rise as graduates'
productivity increases.
The more productive schools
are, the higher their bills, Massy
said.
To fight greater costs, he said
the University is investing
"carefully" and is saving more of
its endowment investments re
turns than before the modeling
began.
"We also became interested in
a lot of investment ideas — but as
luck had it the stock market
crashed in 1974 and we've had to
start the planning over."
Besides fiscal planning,
Massy will supervise University
operations, support services (h
-ousing, personnel, food service)
and accounting control. He will
also handle relations with local
governments and Stanford ten
ants (industrial park and Stan
ford Shopping Center leases).
Despite the range of respon
sibilities, Massy does not con
sider the job unmanageable.
Business Prut. William Massy,
vice provost tor research, said he
will face increasing energy costs
and the South Africa investment
controversy when he becomes
vice president for business and
finance in mid-September.
Massy. 43, succeeds Robert
Augsberger. who leaves office
June 30. Assoc. Vice President
and Controller Kenneth
Creighton will serve during the
interim.
Calling rising utility bills "our
biggest financial problem,"
Massy said he has not yet found a
solution.
While paying the bills is a fi
nancial puzzle, "South Africa is
more of a public relations prob
lem," he said. He added that his
experience as vice provost for re
search has prepared him for de
aling with such issues.
Controversies
Since he became vice provost
in 1971. he has dealt with con
troversies caused by Vietnam
related research, recombinant

DNA experiments, research
done for Iran by faculty members
and restriction of faculty rights
to consult for private groups.
To handle these problems.
Massy said he has needed to be
the liaison between the Univer
sity and the community, bet
ween the faculty and foreign
governments, and between re
searcher;; and sponsors.
In the recombinant DNA case,
he set up a committee to evaluate
the experiments, promoted pub
lic hearings, conducted safety
inspections and made the offi
cial decision to continue the ex
periments.
Massy said he plans to de
velop in full force his own ver
sion of model economics for
universities when he assumes
his new post.
Models
He said his models represent
"aspects of the University — fi
nances, structures, costs. From
them we see what happens if we
make certain changes."
"The main purposes are to
trace implications. . .and to find
tradeoffs — what changes in

planning factors and how much
of these changes is needed to
solve our problems."
Nationally acclaimed for his
work in fiscal planning, Massy
admits, "I've been a modeler vir
tually all of my career. I'd done it
in business for 10 to 12 years and
while sitting in on University
budget discussions, I began to
think about doing the same at
that level."
He said his studies have
helped Stanford stand in the
"advance guard" of research on
college funding. "We're leaders
in our specific area," he said,
"because we've developed
things which no one else has
tried.
"We're helping other schools
(including Harvard) to use this
system to see if it really works."
Degrees of freedom
Though models do not give
specific answers, Massy said
they "tell us what degrees of
freedom we have financially.
They also project what future
years hold." This, he said, "is
vital because we can't just solve


William Massy
for this year."
His modeling system is
adapted from industrial
techniques, "changed quite a
bit" because universities and
corporations have different fi
nancial strategies.
In business, Massy said the
"name of the game is earning
money. The private interest
dominates and the personality of
the company reflects this. The
objective is to produce a profit
which goes to the owners, even if
they are removed from the or
ganization itself."
Universities are public

troversies caused by Vietnam
related research, recombinant

DNA experiments, research
done for Iran by faculty members
and restriction of faculty rights
to consult for private groups.
To handle these problems.
Massy said he has needed to be
the liaison between the Univer
sity and the community, bet
ween the faculty and foreign
governments, and between re
searcher;; and sponsors.
In the recombinant DNA case,
he set up a committee to evaluate
the experiments, promoted pub
lic hearings, conducted safety
inspections and made the offi
cial decision to continue the ex
periments.
Massy said he plans to de
velop in full force his own ver
sion of model economics for
universities when he assumes
his new post.
Models
He said his models represent
"aspects of the University — fi
nances, structures, costs. From
them we see what happens if we
make certain changes."
"The main purposes are to
trace implications. . .and to find
tradeoffs — what changes in

planning factors and how much
of these changes is needed to
solve our problems."
Nationally acclaimed for his
work in fiscal planning, Massy
admits, "I've been a modeler vir
tually all of my career. I'd done it
in business for 10 to 12 years and
while sitting in on University
budget discussions, I began to
think about doing the same at
that level."
He said his studies have
helped Stanford stand in the
"advance guard" of research on
college funding. "We're leaders
in our specific area," he said,
"because we've developed
things which no one else has
tried.
"We're helping other schools
(including Harvard) to use this
system to see if it really works."
Degrees of freedom
Though models do not give
specific answers, Massy said
they "tell us what degrees of
freedom we have financially.
They also project what future
years hold." This, he said, "is
vital because we can't just solve


William Massy
for this year."
His modeling system is
adapted from industrial
techniques, "changed quite a
bit" because universities and
corporations have different fi
nancial strategies.
In business, Massy said the
"name of the game is earning
money. The private interest
dominates and the personality of
the company reflects this. The
objective is to produce a profit
which goes to the owners, even if
they are removed from the or
ganization itself."
Universities are public
interest-dominated with what
Massy calls qualitative and in
tangible criteria for success.
"The values of Stanford involve
teaching, research, quality more
than quantity. It's a whole host of
things where no one group's
values ought to dominate, con
trary to business where stoc
kholders' interests do."
Public sentiment
Stanford trustees interpret
public sentiment rather than
create their own financial
policies, he explained. "It's not
so much what Bill Massy says, or
what President Richard Lyman
says that's right. It's what we in
terpret as the public good."
Hut Massy admits balancing
faculty, student and alumni in
terests is difficult. The Univer
sity budget, for example, is "in
tellectually difficult to ba
lance. . . It's a lot harder than it
used to be because government
support is down and the
economic environment is more

adverse than it used to be.
"In the long run, the major
problem is bow to make the
tradeoff between higher tuition
and academic resources," he
said. "Should we hold down
academic growth and therefore
tuition? he asked. "We must
make a decision about our inten
tions and responsibilities."
The relationship between
Stanford's educational produc
tivity and its financial statusalso
troubles Massy. "Ironically, the
better we do our job, the worse
off we are." He pointed out that
colleges must operate in markets
dominated by wage and price
rates which rise as graduates'
productivity increases.
The more productive schools
are, the higher their bills, Massy
said.
To fight greater costs, he said
the University is investing
"carefully" and is saving more of
its endowment investments re
turns than before the modeling
began.
"We also became interested in
a lot of investment ideas — but as
luck had it the stock market
crashed in 1974 and we've had to
start the planning over."
Besides fiscal planning,
Massy will supervise University
operations, support services (h
-ousing, personnel, food service)
and accounting control. He will
also handle relations with local
governments and Stanford ten
ants (industrial park and Stan
ford Shopping Center leases).
Despite the range of respon
sibilities, Massy does not con
sider the job unmanageable.
Business Prut. William Massy,
vice provost tor research, said he
will face increasing energy costs
and the South Africa investment
controversy when he becomes
vice president for business and
finance in mid-September.
Massy. 43, succeeds Robert
Augsberger. who leaves office
June 30. Assoc. Vice President
and Controller Kenneth
Creighton will serve during the
interim.
Calling rising utility bills "our
biggest financial problem,"
Massy said he has not yet found a
solution.
While paying the bills is a fi
nancial puzzle, "South Africa is
more of a public relations prob
lem," he said. He added that his
experience as vice provost for re
search has prepared him for de
aling with such issues.
