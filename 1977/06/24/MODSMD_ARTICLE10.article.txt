# 'Other earths likely'

"We think it quite likely that
there are other earths out there
circling," declared John Billin
gham, chief of the Extraterrestrial
Biology Division at the NASA-
Ames Research Center in a
speech here Wednesday even
ing.
Billingham addressed about
3 5 persons at Ski 1 ling Au
ditorium.
"If there are other earths, then
quite likely life will originate
and evolve there just as it has
evolved here," he added.
The NASA researcher discus
sed several ways in which scien
tists are investigating the possi
bility of extraterrestrial life. One
method is to examine meteorites
for organic materials — the
building blocks of life.
Another method is interplanet
ary space travel, such as the re
cent unmanned Viking mis
sion, he said. However, Billin
gham added, space travel is im
practical for exploration outside
our solar system.
Billingham urged the use of
microwave receiving units
either on earth, on the moon, or
orbiting in space. These receiv
ing units would explore space
for radio transmissions from
other civilizations.
Billingham called for an in
ternational cooperative effort in
the search for extraterrestrial
life.
"We might be able to answer
some of the extremely funda
mental questions" through such
a search, he said.
