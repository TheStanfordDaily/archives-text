# WATSBOX lowers telephone costs

Due to the installation of a
computerized long distance
telephone system (WATSBOX)
Stanford is saving approxi
mately $35,000 per month in
telephone costs.
The system, which went on
line last August, uses a
minicomputer to select the least
costly available telephone cir
cuits.
According to Marilyn kloes,
telecommunications facilities
supervisor, there was some op
position to the system at first.
People did not believe that the
University would save money by
installing an expensive compu
ter and by employing numerous
people needed to run the tele
communications center, she
said.
But in the 10 months the svs

tern has been in use, it has had
"more compliments than com
plaints," kloes added. So far it
has exceeded by at least $17,000
its predicted monthly savings.
To date, savings total $376,734.
Authorized users of the sys
tem, which include faculty, staff
and administrative officers who
frequently make long distance
calls, must acquire a confiden
tial toll number from the tele
communications center.
When these numbers are
dialed the WATSBOX validates
them and offers the caller a dial
tone. It then chooses the most
economical routing for the call,
places it, records all pertinent
data — including the name of the
caller, and charges it to the Uni
versity department from which
the call originated.
