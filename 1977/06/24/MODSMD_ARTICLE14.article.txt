condominiums and separate

being considered for additional
housing, he said.
However, "it's possible we
might not be convinced that it's
necessary to add to the supply of
on-campus housing," Summers
said.
The most recent major addi

dominium complex, "has been
sold out for some time," Sum
mers said.
That complex, opened in Oc
tober 1975, was called a "ghost
town on the Row," in the January
15, 1976 Daily because only 43
of its 82 units had been sold by
then.

"We were a bit over optimistic
in thinking that we could have
all of the units pre-sold," Sum
mers said. "But within nine
months of completion, all ot the
units were sold out."
Summers added that Pearce
Mitchell units have appreciated
in value by 25 to 50 per cent
since 1975.
About half of the tenured fa
culty and 70 per cent of the fa
culty without tenure live off
campus, Summers said.
