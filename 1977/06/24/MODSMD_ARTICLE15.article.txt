Werner Erhard, founder of
Erhard Seminars Training (EST)
told the Daily Tuesday that EST
is not the only or even necessar
ily the best way to improve the
quality of one's life.
EST is a two-weekend therapy
program which had enrolled
80,000 by mid-1976 and has
drawn national attention. Erhard
gave a two hour lecture at the
Medical Center on Tuesday-
Persons can improve the qual
ity of their lives, Erhard said, by
getting in touch with what he
called the generating forces, or
context. EST, he said, is one way
to.do this.
He said most individuals exist

within the framework of experi
ence and concepts. Often ig
nored is the third aspect, con
text, he said, where logic, time
and sense play no part.
Erhard said context, concepts
and experience are the
paradigms by which we live.
Reasserted that success, such
as wealth, recognition and
power, arises from a well-ordered
set of concepts. While this kind
of achievement brings gratifica
tion, he said, it does not improve
the quality of personal lives.
This improvement is ac
complished. he said, through
transformation (the process of
getting in touch with context or
the generating forces).
