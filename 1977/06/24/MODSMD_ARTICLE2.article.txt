No studies have conclusively supported laet
rile's effectiveness. The American Medical As
sociation recently approved a resolution stating
that laetrile has "no proven value as a drug.'
Jones said he believes the medical establishment
is unable to accept any evidence for laetrile's effec
tiveness because of psychological consequences
which would result. "They would be faced with
the indirect responsibility for 25 years of needless
suffering and death."
Dr. Sarah Donaldson, assistant professor of
radiology here,said she hopes the current interest
in laetrile will fade if it is legalized. This is not a
new issue," says Donaldson. "Every few years
people are talking about a new 'cancer cure.
Donaldson speculates that the attention sur
rounding laetrile may be due to the restrictions on
its use. "Because it's not available and not legal,
there's a mystique about it," she says. "If you cou c
buy it over the counter people would find out it
doesn't work."
"I'm concerned that patients will go to'laetrile

lamplis said he agrees that laetrile is a food sub
stance "but its advocates want to use it as a drug.
"California's anti-quackery law has protected
people from 'little black boxes' for 15 years, says
' d "You and I are not allowed to go out and buy an
empty gold mine either. We're trying to protect the
public from quacks. That's the whole thing.
