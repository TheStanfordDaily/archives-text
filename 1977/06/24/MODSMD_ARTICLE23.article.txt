# ASSU Flicks, Theater in Film
## The
						Marx Brothers 
### Jack Vaughn 
If you've set your heart on se
eing Gone With the Wind. Pat
ton, or even Midnight Cowboy
on campus this summer, you
might be disappointed by the
first few ASSU Flicks offerings.
But if quality rather than name is
what you 're after, there are a var
iety of treats in store at the Flicks
and elsewhere.
The ASSU leads off the season
tomorrow with the hilariously
irreverent Harpo. Chico. Zeppo
and Groucho Marx in Duck Soup.
Their costumes are wild, their
gags range from the quiet and
mildly amusing to the slapstick
and their facial expressions are
unmatched for comedic value.
But the Marx Brothers' real
claim to greatness in Duck Soup,
is their unbridled use of the En

glish language for subtle and
not-so-subtle word games, puns
and especially double en
tendres. The sexuality is masked
by today's standards, but the
subtlety with which they intro
duce it into the dialogue is time
less.
The four brothers are followed
next Sunday by their modern
counterparts in outrageous com
edy, the Monty Python com
pany, in And Now For Some
thing Completely Different. The
cinematography is half the fun
with the Python crew and sight
gags come quickly and furi
ously. Nothing is held back as
institutions (particularly the
British royalty) are bludgeoned,
sexual fantasies are acted out
and in general the world is
placed squarely on its head.

By the second week of study,
students are ready for something
slightly more serious and the
Flicks come through nicely with
Casino Bovale on July 2 and
Bonnie and Cl\ de the following
evening. The former is a lames
Bond thriller with class, with
Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress.
David Niven and Woody Allen
satirizing the British intelli
gence service with a stiletto
rather than the usual blunt in
strument. There is less emphasis
on beautiful bodies for their own
sake (though they're around,
don't you worry) and more on
witty dialogue and a clever plot
line.
Bonnie and Clyde is the first
completely sober flick of the sea
son, but is filled with action.
Tracing the most famous couple
in American crime history, the
film is a good portrayal of a gen
eration of notorious outlaws
without the political motives of
the present age. In addition, the
film is a good period piece for
the 19305.
Duck Soup, Casino Boyale
and Beefer Madness will plav
