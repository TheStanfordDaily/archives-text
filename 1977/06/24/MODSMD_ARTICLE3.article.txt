# Evening classes offered in quarter
## 
### Bill Wien George Anders 
Four evening classes are being
offered on a trial basis this sum
mer, in an effort to "provide bet
ter access to Stanford classes for
community members," accord
ing to Michael Oman, director of
the summer session.
Otherwise, Oman said, the
summer program is little diffe
rent from that of past years.
Some 2206 persons registered
on June 20 as students here. That
was 115 less than on registration
day last summer.
According to Asst. Registrar
Gloria Caring, "it's hard to pre
dict" whether this decrease is
significant because registration
will continue into July.
3300 matriculated
She noted that end-of-summer
statistics for last year showed
about 3300 matriculated stu
dents. meaning that about 1000
registered after registration day
last year.
The experimental evening
classes are in English, statistics,
religious studies and sociology.
Oman said it will be several
weeks before he knows how
many nonstudents in the com
munity are coming here to take
the classes.
If there is substantial com
munity interest in the courses,
Oman said, more may be offered
next year.
High schoolers
Among the persons enrolled
this year are some high school
students who have completed
their junior year. Oman said he

has "no idea yet" how many
high schoolers are registered
here, but noted that in past years
that number has been 30 to 50.
Statistics on the composition
of this summer's student body
will not be available until July,
Caring said.
"The nice thing that every
body enjoyed about this registra
tion," she said, "was the fact that
except in one area in Maples, we
really didn't have lines."
"It was a fairly routine type of
registration," Garing added. She
did say some students who had
been hired to work at registra
tion did not show up.
About the same
The overall number of classes
offered this year is about the
same as last year, Oman said, al
though he pointed out that some
departments may have ex
panded or decreased their offer
ings.
He said because of the Univer
sity's "retrenchment program,"
the summer session is operating
under a tightening budget con
straint since its budget does not
keep pace*with inflation.
Oman is in his first year as di
rector of the summer session. He
replaced L. Wayne Price.
Registration will continue
through July 5 for the eight-week
session and through July 11 for
the 10-week session,
