What is the derivation of the
word "JEEP"?
-??
Bob kirkwood, in the vehicle
distribution department at the
Los Angeles American Motors
Corporation district office (the
people who bring you the jeep)
did some asking aound for me
and came up with this story:
Back during the war when the
government wanted the vehi
cles. they were called: "Vehicle
— general purpose." Gradually,
the "general purpose" was shor
tened to "gp." which sounds like
"jeep." So that's how it hap
pened.
It seems to me like there
should be more to the story than
that. If any of the readers know a
different story, please send me a
note.

Hillary Ryniewicz, head of
Occupational Health and
Facilities protection at the Stan
ford Hospital said, "Yes, there
are plans!" It is not yet known
when it will be, but there is a
plan to install bicycle racks.

','iy are the limited but impor
tant lawns in White Plaza being
dried up in a token act of righte
ousness, while the gross around
Encina was watered this morn
ing (May 27)?
-G.L.
According to Bob Garner at
Plant Services, all the lawns are
presently being watered.
Plant Services has just auto
mated all of the watering sys
tems, however there are still a
few bugs in the system, Garner
said. Therefore, some of the
lawns receive more water than
others by the automatic timing
devices.
This could account for the

lawn in White Plaza
browner, or it could justba
gets more traffic than then
lawn.
