Police fire upon rioters
SOUTH AFRICA—One black rioter was
killed and another wounded yesterday as
riot police fired into a crowd of about
1000 blacks in the segregated town of
Soweto.
The group was protesting the arrest of
several student leaders by the govern
ment last week which were made in an
effort to quell the activists before the an
niversary of the race riots that killed more
than 600 people last year.
As the group rushed a police van, the
police fired "several" shots into the
crowd. Otherwise, they said they were
using tear gas, "sneeze machines," and
batons to dispel the mob.
Soweto's white police chief, Brig. Jan
Visser, called the situation "ugly and con
fused" but under control.
Earlier, a march by 500 Soweto school
children into the center of white Johan
nesburg was broken up by baton
swinging police. They chanted, "We
want our land back," and carried signs
which read, "Vorster. release our lead
ers," and "Bantu education is for the edu
cation of slavery."
In the last seven days of unrest in South
Africa, at least 10 blacks have been killed,
most by police gunfire, and 44 have been
wounded.
Senate overrules Brown
SACRAMENTO —The state Senate yes
terday voted to overrule Gov. Brown's
veto of the Deukemijian bill, which
would restore the death penalty to
California.
Brown had warned the legislature in
January that as a "matter of conscience,"

he would veto any death penalty bill.
To override the bill, its author, Senate
leader Grotge Deukmejian (R-Long
Beach) collected the necessary 27 votes —
exactly the two-thirds majority required.
Twelve senators voted to uphold Gov.
Brown, and there was one abstention.
For the bill to become law without
Brown's signature, the veto would also
have to be rejected by the state Assembly
by a two-thirs margin. That vote will be
sometime in August, when the legislators
return from a five-week vacation period.
The last successful veto override hap
pened to Ronald Regan in 1974. He was
the first governor in 28 years to be so
rejected.
The Deukemijian bill provides a death
sentence for: Murder for hire, murder by
torture, murder committed during other
felonies, murder of a peace officer, mur
der of a witness to prevent testimony,
second conviction for murder, sabotage
resulting in death, malicious use of exp
losives, treason, and perjury resulting in
the execution of an innocent person.
AMA prefers saccharin labels
SAN FRANCISCO —Saccharin should
not be banned until there is evidence that
it causes cancer in humans at normal dos
age levels, the American Medical Associ
ation voted Wednesday.

Instead, labels should be placed on
foods containing the controversial
sweetner warning of the "potential in
crease in the incidence of cancer in ani
mals and humans based on the currently
available evidence," the AMA said.
The association's House of Delegates,
meeting here this week, approved the re
commendations after haggling over
wording for some time.
Most of the delegates in favor of the ban
were critical of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration for inferring too much from
studies conducted on animals which re
vealed a higher incidence of cancer when
huge dosages were imposed.
Physicians treating diabetes patients
were especially harsh in their criticism. "I
hope my diabetic patients live long
enough to get cancer," one delegate told
the Los Angeles Times.
In addition, the association recom
mended that the Food Additive Act,
which today mandates banning sub
stances shown to be carcinogens in ani
mals, be amended to require that the ex
periments must be conducted at dosage
levels representing "normal daily con
sumption for humans."

Senate overrules Brown
SACRAMENTO —The state Senate yes
terday voted to overrule Gov. Brown's
veto of the Deukemijian bill, which
would restore the death penalty to
California.
Brown had warned the legislature in
January that as a "matter of conscience,"

he would veto any death penalty bill.
To override the bill, its author, Senate
leader Grotge Deukmejian (R-Long
Beach) collected the necessary 27 votes —
exactly the two-thirds majority required.
Twelve senators voted to uphold Gov.
Brown, and there was one abstention.
For the bill to become law without
Brown's signature, the veto would also
have to be rejected by the state Assembly
by a two-thirs margin. That vote will be
sometime in August, when the legislators
return from a five-week vacation period.
The last successful veto override hap
pened to Ronald Regan in 1974. He was
the first governor in 28 years to be so
rejected.
The Deukemijian bill provides a death
sentence for: Murder for hire, murder by
torture, murder committed during other
felonies, murder of a peace officer, mur
der of a witness to prevent testimony,
second conviction for murder, sabotage
resulting in death, malicious use of exp
losives, treason, and perjury resulting in
the execution of an innocent person.
AMA prefers saccharin labels
SAN FRANCISCO —Saccharin should
not be banned until there is evidence that
it causes cancer in humans at normal dos
age levels, the American Medical Associ
ation voted Wednesday.

Instead, labels should be placed on
foods containing the controversial
sweetner warning of the "potential in
crease in the incidence of cancer in ani
mals and humans based on the currently
available evidence," the AMA said.
The association's House of Delegates,
meeting here this week, approved the re
commendations after haggling over
wording for some time.
Most of the delegates in favor of the ban
were critical of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration for inferring too much from
studies conducted on animals which re
vealed a higher incidence of cancer when
huge dosages were imposed.
Physicians treating diabetes patients
were especially harsh in their criticism. "I
hope my diabetic patients live long
enough to get cancer," one delegate told
the Los Angeles Times.
In addition, the association recom
mended that the Food Additive Act,
which today mandates banning sub
stances shown to be carcinogens in ani
mals, be amended to require that the ex
periments must be conducted at dosage
levels representing "normal daily con
sumption for humans."

Police fire upon rioters
SOUTH AFRICA—One black rioter was
killed and another wounded yesterday as
riot police fired into a crowd of about
1000 blacks in the segregated town of
Soweto.
The group was protesting the arrest of
several student leaders by the govern
ment last week which were made in an
effort to quell the activists before the an
niversary of the race riots that killed more
than 600 people last year.
As the group rushed a police van, the
police fired "several" shots into the
crowd. Otherwise, they said they were
using tear gas, "sneeze machines," and
batons to dispel the mob.
Soweto's white police chief, Brig. Jan
Visser, called the situation "ugly and con
fused" but under control.
Earlier, a march by 500 Soweto school
children into the center of white Johan
nesburg was broken up by baton
swinging police. They chanted, "We
want our land back," and carried signs
which read, "Vorster. release our lead

rejected.

AMA prefers saccharin labels
SAN FRANCISCO —Saccharin should
not be banned until there is evidence that
it causes cancer in humans at normal dos
age levels, the American Medical Associ
ation voted Wednesday.

Instead, labels should be placed on
foods containing the controversial
sweetner warning of the "potential in
crease in the incidence of cancer in ani
mals and humans based on the currently
available evidence," the AMA said.
The association's House of Delegates,
meeting here this week, approved the re
commendations after haggling over
wording for some time.
Most of the delegates in favor of the ban
were critical of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration for inferring too much from
studies conducted on animals which re
vealed a higher incidence of cancer when
huge dosages were imposed.
Physicians treating diabetes patients
were especially harsh in their criticism. "I
hope my diabetic patients live long
enough to get cancer," one delegate told
the Los Angeles Times.
In addition, the association recom
mended that the Food Additive Act,
which today mandates banning sub
stances shown to be carcinogens in ani
mals, be amended to require that the ex
periments must be conducted at dosage
levels representing "normal daily con
sumption for humans."
