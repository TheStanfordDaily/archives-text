# Changing times

"Who wants to get a bachelor's
degree in philosophy and
starve," more and more students
think, as they choose majors in
the hard sciences over the
humanities and social sciences.
There certainly has been a
trend away from the psychedelic
'60s where we were taking ev
erything from beginning sitar to
advanced Hindu. My friends are
job oriented, they're thinking in
practical terms. In the '60s, can
dle making was the ultimate in
"practicality."
You can't say our social con
sciences are sublimated by our
new-born pragmatism. Let the
294 arrested in Old Union dur
ing the apartheid demonstration
stand as witnesses to student in
volvement today.
But many leaders in the de
monstration were not
philosophy or psychology
majors, but biology majors and
business students. Some of them
are going to medical school next
fall.
Perhaps they realize that
change can be implemented
most effectively from within the
system. Anti-establishment con
cerns have been replaced, or for
the most part overshadowed, by
studies.
Somehow I sense, however,
that people are not as ready to
drop their frisbees or abandon
their 10-speeds and 280Zs to
march for a cause. Many of those
milling about Old Union that
day were satisfying their curios
ity about "active involvement"
— they were seeking a taste of
the past. What was a real de
monstration like?
Are we really more concerned

with our own futures than the
future of the world? Does the fu
ture of the planet take second
place in our concerns? Does the
earth belong to us all or are we
more concerned with our own
little plot?
In these money-tight days, the
trend is away from such social
sciences as history, philosophy
and political science, and to
ward occupational courses such
as electronic technology and en
gineering.
Nevertheless, we are not an in
stant replay of the so-called "Si
lent Generation" of the '50s —
we do not generally adopt un
critically the middle-class stan
dards of success.
The '70s student is not a
barefoot floater of the '60s, but
neither is he ready to sell his soul
or spare time for a professional
career.
There are no pat answers to
success and happiness and we
know it. We have many choices
to make, from which courses to
take and why, on up. If we need
change, be it to play, travel or
work, we're not dropping out,
but stopping out.
Even the physical education
class enrollment indicates a
keen interest in individual
rather than group-oriented pur
suits. Look at the popularity of
tennis, folk dancing, sailing,
scuba diving and fencing over
team-oriented sports.
Our emphasis is on individu
ality, but let's not lose sight of
the fact that we are a team. Let's
stay concerned about others,
about the world.
