Israel support
In her article (Daily. May 26), Rachelle Marshall
deplores the continued presence of Israel in the
occupied lands. Perhaps it has slipped her mind
that these territories were conquered by jordan and
illegally occupied for 19 years until her defeat in
the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Why did the international community accord
Jordan's occupation of the West Bank and East
Jerusalem its implied approval by silence, while
later rising in righteous wrath against Israel?Canit
be that there is a double standard in operation —a
stringent one for the Jewish state and an indulgent
one for other nations? Why does not Marshall
speak out against the Soviet Union's continued
and tyrannical occupation of the Baltic States, or
against the Turkish occupation of Cyprus?
As for the Arab village of Deir Yassin, Marshall
asserts that 1550 civilians were "murdered" by the
Israelis ignoring certain relevant facts about this
event. At a stroke of her pen, Marshall has trans
formed the small village of Deir Yassin to a town
that allegedly suffered 1550 casualties.
The loss of even one life is to be deplored and
mourned. In Deir Yassin there was a loss of 240
not, as Marshall asserts, 1550 Arab lives The
episode was one of many during a state of war
started and perpetuated by the Arabs. Regrettably
in war lives are lost. The Deir Yassin incident was a
military operation, not a terrorist attack which is a
favorite exercise of the Arabs as the world has
reason to know.
Perhaps Marshall will think less harshly of her
favorite target, Israel, upon learning that it has
been that nation's unexceptional policy to give
warning tocivi lians before engaging in battle This
was true in Deir Yassin. This village was being
used as a base by Arab mercenaries who had con

hus cutting off the road between Tel-Aviv and
eri 'sal e m. !n consequence, thecivUian population
h Rffective| y de P"ved of food
and water by the besieging Jordanian Legion
It was during their advance to relieve these bloc
kaded civilians that the Israeli contingent came
upon Deir Yassin. They were not, incidentally led
by Menachem Begin, as Marshall mendaciously.

In her article (Daily. May 26), Rachelle Marshall
deplores the continued presence of Israel in the
occupied lands. Perhaps it has slipped her mind
that these territories were conquered by jordan and
illegally occupied for 19 years until her defeat in
the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Why did the international community accord
Jordan's occupation of the West Bank and East
Jerusalem its implied approval by silence, while
later rising in righteous wrath against Israel?Canit
be that there is a double standard in operation —a
stringent one for the Jewish state and an indulgent
one for other nations? Why does not Marshall
speak out against the Soviet Union's continued
and tyrannical occupation of the Baltic States, or
against the Turkish occupation of Cyprus?
As for the Arab village of Deir Yassin, Marshall
asserts that 1550 civilians were "murdered" by the
Israelis ignoring certain relevant facts about this
event. At a stroke of her pen, Marshall has trans
formed the small village of Deir Yassin to a town
that allegedly suffered 1550 casualties.
The loss of even one life is to be deplored and
mourned. In Deir Yassin there was a loss of 240
not, as Marshall asserts, 1550 Arab lives The
episode was one of many during a state of war
started and perpetuated by the Arabs. Regrettably
in war lives are lost. The Deir Yassin incident was a
military operation, not a terrorist attack which is a
favorite exercise of the Arabs as the world has
reason to know.
Perhaps Marshall will think less harshly of her
favorite target, Israel, upon learning that it has
been that nation's unexceptional policy to give
warning tocivi lians before engaging in battle This
was true in Deir Yassin. This village was being
used as a base by Arab mercenaries who had con
thnl It fr i° uses ' nto verUa ble fortresses,
hus cutting off the road between Tel-Aviv and
eri 'sal e m. !n consequence, thecivUian population

It was during their advance to relieve these bloc

upon Deir Yassin. They were not, incidentally led
by Menachem Begin, as Marshall mendaciously.
