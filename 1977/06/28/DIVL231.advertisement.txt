If you are looking for a taste of the newspaper business without the
usual high pressure, the Daily is looking for you. We need reporters,
reviewers, and photographers and in the summer the atmosphere is
somewhat more relaxed. Stop by the office any time Wednesday or
Thursday afternoon, or come in Monday or Thursday nights when
we're putting out the paper (7 p.m. to about 2 a.m.).
We're located in the Storke Student Publications Building just off
Santa Teresa Street next to the new Terman Engineering Building.
No experience is necessary.
