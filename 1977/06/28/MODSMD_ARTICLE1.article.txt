# Doctor to answer fraud allegations
## 
### George Anders 
!oltan Lucas, associate
nr of surgery here, will
ithtop hospital adminis
ater this week to discuss
st in a series of allega
out his work, according
Schwartz, assistant vice
nt for medical affairs.
Iniversity learned earlier
nth that Lucas may have
inflicting statements
hether he has submitted
(articles to journals for
■ion, Schwartz said,
(reported to his sponsor
■ncy, the National Insti
■Health (Nil I), that he had
Bed seven articles to sci
■ournals for publication,
Jies Schriver, an NIH in
■or in Washington, D.C.
■chriver said he later re
■eports that Lucas stated
■ not submitted the arti
■it' reports are based on
■estimony during a court
■ation earlier this year,
■ said.
■ was not available for
Kit.
fr ious years, Lucas has
Bccusations of reporting

experiments he had not per
formed and of reporting a consis
tency in his results that lab notes
did not support.
Such charges were twice refer
red to faculty committees,
Schwartz said.
In committee reports of 1974
and 1975, "neither committee
found any evidence of any delib
erate scientific misrepresenta
tion," Schwartz said.
"The committees found no
evidence of misrepresentation,"
stated Spyros Andreopoulos, in
formation officer for the Medical
Center.
On the new set of charges,
Clayton Rich, vice president for
medical affairs, has asked Lucas
for a response, Andreopoulos
said.
Meet with Lucas
Schwartz said Rich will be one
of the administrators who will
"meet with Dr. L,ucas in the latter
part of this week. I assume they
will discuss the matter further."
Rich confirmed the meeting,
but declined to make further
comments.
According to Schriver, the
discrepancy in Lucas' publica

• tion efforts was first pointed out
by Dr. Eugene Dong, associate
professor of cardiovascular
surgery.
Dong wrote Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.), informing him
of the discrepancy, Shriver said.
Kennedy is chairman of the Se
nate Subcommittee on Health
and Scientific Research.
Dong was out of town and un
available for comment.
Schriver said NIH has yet to
take any action on the alleged
discrepancy. NIH is waiting to
observe the results of a Stanford
investigation if one is underta
ken, he said.
Investigation
"It's possible we might not be
satisfied with the Stanford in
vestigation," he said, "and
might want to look deeper."
Schwartz stressed that the
University will not decide
whether any sort of investigation
is needed until after Lucas con
fers with Rich.
Lucas is also fighting a law
suit charging that documents he
sent to NIH several years ago
libeled one of his employes. The

University is a co-defendent in
the suit, according to the June 21
San Jose Mercurv-
That former employe, Dr. A.
Baronio Martins, charges that
his work and reputation were at
tacked by Lucas to prevent
Lucas' "own false reports and
publications from being con
tradicted and discovered."
'Discovery stage'
The suit was filed in 1975, but
is still in "the discovery stage,"
said Martins, who now works for
Alza Corp. "The other side has
definitely not been very
prompt," he said.
During interrogation before
the suit goes to trial, Lucas made
his statements that he had not
submitted certain articles for
publication. These appear to be
the articles which he had listed
on NIH progress reports as hav
ing been submitted. Schwartz
said.
The second faculty committee
issued its report in 1975. but
continued discussions into
1976, Schwartz said.
The deliberations of both
committees were kept secret.
The San Jose Mercury reported

that Dong objected to the secrecy
provision.
'Crucified'
Schwartz defended the provi
sion, though, saying that a per
son cleared by a faculty commit
tee might nonetheless be
"crucified" if all testimony were
made public.
If such a study does uncover
wrongdoing, however. Schwartz
said, then public disclosure of
the findings of the investigation
might be desirable.
Andreopoulos said he knew of
no instance at the Medical
Center where a doctor has been
found guilty of misrepresenting
his publication efforts or of fak
ing research.
He noted that a doctor at New
York's Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center was accused of faking re
search results several years ago.
"But it is very dangerous to
compare this to that." An
dreopoulos said.
Both Schwartz and An
dreopoulos declined to com
ment on what penalties Lucas
could face if he is found to have
misrepresented his publications
efforts.

Schwartz stressed that the
University will not decide
whether any sort of investigation
is needed until after Lucas con
fers with Rich.
Lucas is also fighting a law
suit charging that documents he
sent to NIH several years ago
libeled one of his employes. The

University is a co-defendent in
the suit, according to the June 21
San Jose Mercurv-
That former employe, Dr. A.
Baronio Martins, charges that
his work and reputation were at
tacked by Lucas to prevent
Lucas' "own false reports and
publications from being con
tradicted and discovered."
'Discovery stage'
The suit was filed in 1975, but
is still in "the discovery stage,"
said Martins, who now works for
Alza Corp. "The other side has
definitely not been very
prompt," he said.
During interrogation before
the suit goes to trial, Lucas made
his statements that he had not
submitted certain articles for
publication. These appear to be
the articles which he had listed
on NIH progress reports as hav
ing been submitted. Schwartz
said.
The second faculty committee
issued its report in 1975. but
continued discussions into
1976, Schwartz said.
The deliberations of both
committees were kept secret.
The San Jose Mercury reported

that Dong objected to the secrecy
provision.
'Crucified'
Schwartz defended the provi
sion, though, saying that a per
son cleared by a faculty commit
tee might nonetheless be
"crucified" if all testimony were
made public.
If such a study does uncover
wrongdoing, however. Schwartz
said, then public disclosure of
the findings of the investigation
might be desirable.
Andreopoulos said he knew of
no instance at the Medical
Center where a doctor has been
found guilty of misrepresenting
his publication efforts or of fak
ing research.
He noted that a doctor at New
York's Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center was accused of faking re
search results several years ago.
"But it is very dangerous to
compare this to that." An
dreopoulos said.
Both Schwartz and An
dreopoulos declined to com
ment on what penalties Lucas
could face if he is found to have
misrepresented his publications
efforts.

Such charges were twice refer
red to faculty committees,
Schwartz said.
In committee reports of 1974
and 1975, "neither committee
found any evidence of any delib

"The committees found no
evidence of misrepresentation,"
stated Spyros Andreopoulos, in
formation officer for the Medical
Center.
On the new set of charges,
Clayton Rich, vice president for
medical affairs, has asked Lucas
for a response, Andreopoulos
said.
Meet with Lucas
Schwartz said Rich will be one
of the administrators who will
"meet with Dr. L,ucas in the latter
part of this week. I assume they
will discuss the matter further."
Rich confirmed the meeting,
but declined to make further
comments.
According to Schriver, the
discrepancy in Lucas' publica

• tion efforts was first pointed out
by Dr. Eugene Dong, associate
professor of cardiovascular
surgery.
Dong wrote Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.), informing him
of the discrepancy, Shriver said.
Kennedy is chairman of the Se
nate Subcommittee on Health
and Scientific Research.
Dong was out of town and un
available for comment.
Schriver said NIH has yet to
take any action on the alleged
discrepancy. NIH is waiting to
observe the results of a Stanford
investigation if one is underta
ken, he said.
