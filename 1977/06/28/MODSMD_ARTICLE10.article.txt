# Refittings next ste[illegible] in energy planning

The University's efforts to cut
energy costs by "quick fix"
changes and voluntary conser
vation have given way to sub
stantial refitting and conversion
of equipment, according to a re
cent University energy report.
The report, by the Office of the
Vice President for Business and
Finance, outlines the energy
management and conservation
program begun here in October
1973.
Initial conservation work was
focused on projects designed to
achieve rapid high energy sav
ings at negligible cost, the report
said.
Most of these were non
technical measures to reduce
temperature and electricity use
levels. Some examples include:
—removal of unnecessary
light bulbs, both incandescent
and florescent;
—redesign of street and park
ing lot lighting systems, includ
ing installation of time clocks;
and
—application of time clock
control to building ventilation
systems.
While these measures, to
gether with voluntary conserva
tion, brought dramatic energy
use reductions within 10
months, the report said energy
price hikes more than offset the
usage changes.
For this reason, the University
has undertaken refitting and
conversion measures to further
reduce energy consumption, the
report said.
Some projects implemented in
the last three years were:
—expansion of the campus au
tomation system to improve its
ability to control ventilation de
vices and valves; and
—conversion of seven campus
buildings from individual air
conditioning units to central
plant connections.
Conservation efforts have not

Examples include:

and a eucalpytus treefari
