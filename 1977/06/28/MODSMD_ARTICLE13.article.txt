# Cafe Meursault

### Fred Grethei 
for wine, quiet evenings

If you're looking for a relaxed
spotfora light lunch or fora cool
summer evening sipping wine,
you might consider Cafe Meur
sault located at 651 Emerson
Street in downtown Palo Alto.
The cafe is touted as a "Wine and
food establishment." Rightly so.
When you arrive for your meal
(noon-2 p.m. for lunch, 6-10 p.m.
for dinner) you will have a
choice of seating in either the re
staurant proper that strikingly
resembles a World War Two
French cafe — after the bomb
ing— or on a patio with "rustic"
and rusted terrace furniture.
Paul, chef de cuisine and man
ager of the cafe, shrugs off the
decor by contending. "We are
the antithesis of Stickney's."
Ken, maitre d', busperson and
maniac extruordina ire will
probably accost and seat you
while wagging his sexist, glib,
and ludicrous tongue. My com
panions and I sat outside, and
while we ordered wine Ken had
a "lively" conversation with the
gas station attendant across the
street. I suppose his chatter may
be amusing, but at times it was a
bit much.
The cafe seems to be a favorite
of the Palo Alto "hip" commun
ity — those people who 10 years
ago drove beat-up VW busses
with a peace sign in lieu of the
VW insignia, but who now often
drive late model BMW's and

wear Birkenstocks. At times
someone may jump up and play
on the piano until he tires or
the management intervenes.
Our wine, Chateau La Coste
1976 ($3.75), was described to us
as not spectacular but dry. As we
desired a dry white at a moderate
price we tried it, but I found it to
be less dry than purported and a
bit acidic — even at this price not
satisfactory.
However, I feel that our ex
perience was an exception and
not the rule, for Cafe Meursault
has wines that range from $3 to
over $100 and include both im
ports and native Californian
vintages. One problem was that
there is no wine list and Ken
must act as a walking index of
the various vinos.
This wasexplained to measan
unfortunate necessity due to the
weekly variation of offerings.
The cafe has a rather limited
menu, including crepes with
several fillings, cheese and meat
boards, stew, quiche and "eggs
en cocotte." One of my compan
ions had the stew. It seemed a bit
old — at the point where the
meat and vegetables were disin
tegrating and becoming "one"
with the wine based broth that
was appropriately spiced.
This dinner ($3.80) came with
some dark bread and abagle both
of which seemed fresh. Another
of our party and I had crepes. I
chose "Crepes Pantagruel"

($3.50), a dish that has
the two French "pancakes"
filled with mushrooms, Dofino,
Jarlsberg. and cheddar cheese
along with slices of turkey. I
found the filling good, the cre
pes sufficiently light, but the
cream and port sauce that co
vered the dish was heavy.
On the side was a bean salad
that I didn't feel "fit" the meal.
In general, the crepe dishes will
satiate only the modest appetite,
especially if you plan on drink
ing much wine.
Desserts are offered sporadi
cally. The evening that we dined
there was chocolate mousse.
All in all the food is good. You
might want to try one of the
specialities de la mnison that
often include crepes stuffed with
crabmeat or shrimp. Most impor
tant of all, choose your wine
carefully and you will have a
fine, casual meal.

Ken, maitre d', busperson and
maniac extruordina ire will
probably accost and seat you
while wagging his sexist, glib,
and ludicrous tongue. My com
panions and I sat outside, and
while we ordered wine Ken had
a "lively" conversation with the
gas station attendant across the
street. I suppose his chatter may
be amusing, but at times it was a
bit much.
The cafe seems to be a favorite
of the Palo Alto "hip" commun
ity — those people who 10 years
ago drove beat-up VW busses
with a peace sign in lieu of the
VW insignia, but who now often
drive late model BMW's and

wear Birkenstocks. At times
someone may jump up and play
on the piano until he tires or
the management intervenes.
Our wine, Chateau La Coste
1976 ($3.75), was described to us
as not spectacular but dry. As we
desired a dry white at a moderate
price we tried it, but I found it to
be less dry than purported and a
bit acidic — even at this price not
satisfactory.
However, I feel that our ex
perience was an exception and
not the rule, for Cafe Meursault
has wines that range from $3 to
over $100 and include both im
ports and native Californian
vintages. One problem was that
there is no wine list and Ken
must act as a walking index of
the various vinos.
This wasexplained to measan
unfortunate necessity due to the
weekly variation of offerings.
The cafe has a rather limited
menu, including crepes with
several fillings, cheese and meat
boards, stew, quiche and "eggs
en cocotte." One of my compan
ions had the stew. It seemed a bit
old — at the point where the
meat and vegetables were disin
tegrating and becoming "one"
with the wine based broth that
was appropriately spiced.
This dinner ($3.80) came with
some dark bread and abagle both
of which seemed fresh. Another
of our party and I had crepes. I
chose "Crepes Pantagruel"

($3.50), a dish that has
the two French "pancakes"
filled with mushrooms, Dofino,
Jarlsberg. and cheddar cheese
along with slices of turkey. I
found the filling good, the cre
pes sufficiently light, but the
cream and port sauce that co
vered the dish was heavy.
On the side was a bean salad
that I didn't feel "fit" the meal.
In general, the crepe dishes will
satiate only the modest appetite,
especially if you plan on drink
ing much wine.
Desserts are offered sporadi
cally. The evening that we dined
there was chocolate mousse.
All in all the food is good. You
might want to try one of the
specialities de la mnison that
often include crepes stuffed with
crabmeat or shrimp. Most impor
tant of all, choose your wine
carefully and you will have a
fine, casual meal.

for wine, quiet evenings

If you're looking for a relaxed
spotfora light lunch or fora cool
summer evening sipping wine,
you might consider Cafe Meur
sault located at 651 Emerson
Street in downtown Palo Alto.
The cafe is touted as a "Wine and
food establishment." Rightly so.
When you arrive for your meal
(noon-2 p.m. for lunch, 6-10 p.m.
for dinner) you will have a
choice of seating in either the re
staurant proper that strikingly
resembles a World War Two
French cafe — after the bomb
ing— or on a patio with "rustic"
and rusted terrace furniture.
