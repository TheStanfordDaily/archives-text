# Falling in love with Chinese Inn
## 
### Fred Grethei 
There comes a time when
every haughty restaurant re
viewer must admit that he has
fallen in love. My new favorite
for Mandarin and Cantonese
cuisine is the Chinese Inn, 1352
El Camino Real in Menlo Park.
The restaurant prepares dishes
that will delight even the most
demanding epicure.
The Inn is owned and oper
ated by Mr. and Mrs. Chin along
with their daughter Pauline. The
Chin's and the rest of the staff are
sure to make you feel at ease, and
they provide excellent service
that includes detailed know
ledge about the content and pre
paration of the food. Due to the
Chins and the cozy but not
cramped main dining room, the
atmosphere is homey.
We chose Viccarie Soaye 1973
($5) for our wine. It is an excel
lent, light, dry Italian white that
accented our meal superbly. Ita
lian white wines remain my
favorite and they will never
cease to amaze me for their ver
satility. The restaurant has an
adequate selection of Califor
nia n and imported wines.
We began with Wintermelon
Soup ($2.50 for four), that has
bits of chicken, mushrooms and
wintermelon swirling in a light
broth. I he soup was prepared
well; it was not heavily seasoned
and the melon was not soggy.
Wintermelon is a seasonal offer
ing, but you needn't worry as the

menu shows nearly 20 varieties,
of which Wor Won Ton ($2.25) is
a favorite at luncheon.
We sampled several appetiz
ers that were all steaming hot —
an attribute that is not found in
many establishments. They in
cluded a very good egg roll
(three for $1.50), butterfly
prawns ($.1.50). steamed pork
buns (two for $.60) and golden
fried chicken wings ($2.95). All
of the battered choices were
crisp.
For the gourmet, fancy chic
ken roll ($3.50) is chicken and
ham pressed in thin layers,
coated with eggwhite and batter,
and rolled layer upon layer to
create one of the most delicate

appetizers I have ever tasted. Fi
nally, Kuo Tieh, or pot stickers,
(six for $1.95) are inexpensive
and fantastic!
We also sampled Steak Cubes
with Chinese Pea Pods, one of
Chef Hubert Kwang's favorites.
Again, the dish was exquisite,
as the steak was lean, tender, and
very flavorful. Both dishes were
wonderful, but the creme de la
creme was Nu Shu Pork — cab
bage, black mushrooms,
peapods, lilly buds, onions, and
egg; all of which you roll in a
steaming, paper thin dough
wrapper that you have spread
with tasty plum sauce.
I have never had better, nor

may you as the Chins specialize
in making the dough wrappers
that they sell to restaurants all
over the country. The filling's
excellence follows logically.
I can only touch upon a few of
the many possibilities found at
the Chinese Inn. The consistent
quality of the food from soup to
entree, along with the caring
service are an unbeatable com
bination. A discovery I'd like to
keep all to myself, the Inn is
open for lunch at 11:30 a.m. (Sat.
and Sun. 12), and closes at 9 p.m.
(Fri. and Sat. 9:30 p.m.). For
lunch, dinner, or take-outs, the
food is some of the best in the
Bay Area.
