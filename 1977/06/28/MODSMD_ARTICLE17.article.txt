# Balkan Village
## Food just half the fun 
### George Anders 
When you walk into the Bal
kan Village on a Saturday night,
you'll get more than just a first
rate Greek meal.
The Los Altos restaurant also
features a three-piece Greek
band, a belly dancer and a
singer who lifts tables with his
teeth.
All in all, it makes for the best
dinner/floorshow combination
this side of the Nevada state line.
Complete dinners cost bet
ween $6 and $9, and include
soup or salad, baklava and cof
fee. The entrees are uniformly
excellent, with top cuts of beef
and lamb carefully cooked and
seasoned.
The Donnar Kebab, the most
expensive entree at $8.95, is a
mound of marinated strips of
beef. The less expensive pas
titso, Greece's answer to lasagna,
is another standout.
Also well worth ordering are
the Dolmades (meat in grape
leaves) and Lamb Kabama.

The zucchini squash which
accompanies each main course
even drew compliments from
one confirmed zucchini-hater.
Then it's time to enjoy the
floor show, which starts at 9:30
p.m. and midnight on Fridays
and Saturdays.
If you've ever wanted to learn
to belly dance, the Balkan Vil
lage's dancer gives lessons — on
stage — to three male patrons
who are willing to have a whole
restaurant laugh at them or
applaud them.
But it's unlikely that anyone
will try to imitate the man who
lifts tables with his teeth, and
twirls them with awesome ease.
The few flaws of the Balkan
Village are hardly major. The re
staurant's tiny tables make it a
challenge to keep wine and ap
petizers on the table. The Feta
cheese is disappointingly mild.
These hardly diminish the
ambiance of the Balkan Village,
though.
