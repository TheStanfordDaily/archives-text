## Sandwiches & pizza 
### Randy Keith Harry Killas 
Ramona's, open a little more
than a year, is different from the
typical "beer, pizza and make it
fast" place.
Using a variety of woods for
the tables, booths and counters
and with a liberal sprinkling of
plants, Ramona's produces a
mellow setting which is becom
ing increasingly popular in
Northern California.
Specializing in pizza, the estab
lishment also attempts to satisfy
a medley of appetites by offering
submarine sandwiches and dis
hes prepared on their grill. A
popular salad bar is usually the
patron's first stop after being
shown to his table. For $1.20 a
bowl you may fill it to overflow
ing with crisp lettuce topped
with an amazing assortment of
fresh vegetables such as cherry

tomatoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing.
The pizza is made with fresh
hand spun dough which forms a
fairly thick crust.
The large size really is large,
and because of the generous por
tions of cheese can be deceiv
ingly filling. A large Special,
containing "almost everything,"
runs $9.15, the most expensive
dish in the house. A problem
with all of the pizza is the small
amount of topping, relative to
the amount of cheese. Nonethe
less, although the prices may
seem high, once you look at the
pizza in front of you, you know
you've found a good deal.
The submarine sandwiches,
with their melted cheese top
ping your choice of meat, are as
delicious as the pizza. The tur-
