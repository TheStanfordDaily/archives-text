He would tell them that good adv

than good adventures; that
nearly every audience has its

is such a thing as too much ten

As it stands, this picture's
makers are suffering from an ad
vanced case of the Texas Chain
Saw disease. The most notice
able manifestation (other than
terminal boredom) is the mista

Deep is a case in point.
This ought not to be inter

There are few experiences as

truly primal as fast-paced un
ified blood-and-guts, devoured
in a single-bite thrillers (Jaws).
Unfortunately, the key to th
ose, lacking at least as far as The
Deep is concerned, is "unity."
There are good performances
(Robert Shaw's curmudgeon and
Eli Wallach's wino) and the
camera work is generally out
standing. But the movie is no
thing more than a broken-down
vehicle, overloaded with the
above-mentioned, unrelated
spectacles.
For awhle it works, because
for awhile this is a damn scary
movie. It begins with one of
those carefree, vacationing
couples who stumble on one of
those incredible underwater tre
asures: a shipload of morphine,
with a galleon of gold beneath it.
Eventually, the plot grows too
bizarre and the dialogue too in
sipid and the whole thing falls
apart.
