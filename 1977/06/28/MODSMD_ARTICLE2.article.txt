I Badon said. But he

said action on a previous appli
cation does not affect a transfer's
chances.
Unlike freshman admissions,
transfer admissions are proces
sed on a rolling basis here, with
students receiving admissions
office decisions at different
times.
"But we're rolling out rather
cautiously," Hargadon said, not
ing that spring quarter trans
cripts have not yet arrived from
some candidates' schools.
"It makes things very tough,"
Hargadon said. The admissions
office has "sent a lot of letters,"
he continued, but about 600
candidates have yet to be
notified of the University's deci
sion.
"I wish we could let them all
know early," Hargadon said,
"but we try not to sew up
places."
In future years, Hargadon said,
the number of transfer students
admitted "won't stay this low.''
This spring, an unusually
large percentage of high school
seniors accepted their offers of
admission here, with the result
that this fall's entering freshman
class will be about 1600 instead
of the targeted 1500.

Over 100 persons ranging from high school juniors to some barely half that age are on
campus for the Football Coaching Camp, according to Bob Young, associate director of
athletics.
This is the third year for the camp, Young said. A basketball camp is in its second year and
a soccer camp has been running for quite a few summers, he added.
