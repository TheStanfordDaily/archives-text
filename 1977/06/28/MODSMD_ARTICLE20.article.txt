## Cobham's hot jazz 
### 
Performing his newest works
Hilly Cobham appeared for two
sets at theCreat American Music
Hall, June 26. The pieces spark
led with an intensity characteris
tic of Cobham. All his selections
will appear on the album Magic,
appearing in October.
In addition to featuring new
works, the concert was the debut
of Cobham's new band. The
band included Peter Monyue
formerly of the L.A. Express.
Cobham captivated the audi
ence throughout the perfor
mance with his amazing drum
solos. Cobham rapped out a furi
ous paced rhythm that brought
unceasing applause from the
audience.
Cobham's music is a combina
tion of rhythm-oriented funk
and creative electronic music. It
is an attempt to utilize the ver
satility of the synthesizer in co
operation with the rhythm
oriented Afro-American style of
music.

The style has two problems.
First, in his attempt to make
creative use of the electronic
sounds at his command Cobham
often goes beyond music and
ends up with little more than
noise. Second, Cobham's em
phasis on rhythm does not allow
for the rest of the band to show
their abilities.
Cobham conquers these dif
ficulties in his piece Magic.
Cobham uses the electronic
music and drumming to build
around instrumental solos.
Bassist Randy Jackson played
his solo inMogic with a style and
flair comparable to that of the
Crusader's Robert Popwell. It
was also inMogic that the talents
Peter Monyue were given a
chance to shine.
The Cobham concert's most
important facet was the potential
excitement it showed a jazz con
cert can generate without the
gimmicks used in many con
temporary concerts.
