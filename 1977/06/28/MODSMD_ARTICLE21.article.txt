43 killed in prison fire
Columbia. Tenn. —43 inmates were
killed in a fire at the Maury County jail
here during visiting hours Sunday. The
fire began in a padded cell, and the smoke
was pumped through the jail by the
prison ventilating system. Most of the vic
tims died through asphyxiation within
four minutes.
At the time of the fire, about 150 per
sons were in the jail, 64 of them prisoners.
None of the visitors were reported in
jured.
Bill Walter administrator of the Maury
County Hospital, said 70 persons were
taken there for treatment, and that 43 of
them, including five women, were dead
of smoke inhalation.
Dep. William Duke said the fire
"started back there in this cell and appa
rently went into the ventilation system. It
just filled the building with smoke."
He also said that when the prisoners
began screaming, jailer Jerry Dickey
grabbed the keys to the cellblock. As he
ran to the door to the visiting area, the
door flew open and visitors came flowing
out.
"Everybody panicked." Duke said.
"They just knocked the keys out of his
hand."
With the thick smoke, it took 12 mi
nutes to find the keys, he said, and by that
timefiremen had begun breaking through
the outside walls.
It took the firemen two hours to control
the fire, and Fire Capt. Mac Craft said,
"We had many, many persons die."
Carter warns Israelis
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
told Israel yesterday that no territory can
be "automatically excluded" from Mid
dle East peace talks. He specifically men
tioned the occupied West Bank of the Jor
dan River, an area claimed by both Tel
Aviv and the Arab states.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin said his government would be ex

tremely reluctant to yield the West Bank
because it is part of historical Israel.
He said his people paid dearly to recap
ture the land during the Six Day War in
1967.
Carter's warning was criticized by Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y ), an avowed Israel
supporter. He called the administration's
announcement "unrealistic" and likely to
increase rather than ease war tensions.
Attorney ads allowed
Washington — The Supreme Court de
cided 5-4 yesterday to allow lawyers to
advertise their fees for routine jobs like
drawing up wills or handling uncon
tested divorces.
The court ruled state laws prohibiting
such advertising violated the First
Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
Its majority decision said "it is entirely
possible that advertising will serve to re
duce, not advance, the cost of legal ser
vices to the consumer."
According to Justice Harry Blackmun's
opinion, the court found publicizing
prices is not inherently misleading, since
only routine services lend themselves to
this treatment. He said though, that "ad
vertising that is false, deceptive, or mis
leading, of course is subject to restraint."
The American Bar Association first re
stricted lawyers' advertisements in 1908
in support of professional dignity. The
ban now is enforced in all states either by
law or by court order.
Fuel standards raised
Washington — Despite complaints
from the auto industry, the Carter ad

ministration has acted to make the
gasoline-efficiency standards tougher in
the years between 1980 and 1985.
Transportation Secretary Brock Adams
Sunday outlined the increased standards
for average fuel economy and noted that
the existing target of 27.5 miles pergallon
by 1985 may be too conservative.
In a television interview, Adams said
that existing mileage standards "are read
ily achievable with presently known
technology, and the prospect of further
fuel economy improvements through ad
ditional weight reductions and alterna
tive engines supports the need for con
sidering higher fuel economy require
ments for 1985 and beyond."
Adams announced that cars already re
quired to average 20 m.p.g. in 1980 will
be required to average 22 m.p.g. for model
year 1981, 24 m.p.g. for 1982, 26 m.p.g.
for 1983, and 27 m.p.g. for 1984 models.
He added that 1C billion gallons of
gasoline a day would be eventually saved
as a result of the standards, and consum
ers would save $1000 in the cost of
gasoline over the life of a car.
The Big Four automakers say they lack
the money and know-how to meet exist
ing average fuel-consumption standards
and air-pollution requirements while still
designing marketable cars.

43 killed in prison fire
Columbia. Tenn. —43 inmates were
killed in a fire at the Maury County jail
here during visiting hours Sunday. The
fire began in a padded cell, and the smoke
was pumped through the jail by the
prison ventilating system. Most of the vic
tims died through asphyxiation within
four minutes.
At the time of the fire, about 150 per
sons were in the jail, 64 of them prisoners.
None of the visitors were reported in
jured.
Bill Walter administrator of the Maury
County Hospital, said 70 persons were
taken there for treatment, and that 43 of
them, including five women, were dead
of smoke inhalation.
Dep. William Duke said the fire
"started back there in this cell and appa
rently went into the ventilation system. It
just filled the building with smoke."
He also said that when the prisoners
began screaming, jailer Jerry Dickey
grabbed the keys to the cellblock. As he
ran to the door to the visiting area, the
door flew open and visitors came flowing
out.
"Everybody panicked." Duke said.
"They just knocked the keys out of his
hand."
With the thick smoke, it took 12 mi
nutes to find the keys, he said, and by that
timefiremen had begun breaking through
the outside walls.
It took the firemen two hours to control
the fire, and Fire Capt. Mac Craft said,
"We had many, many persons die."
Carter warns Israelis
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
told Israel yesterday that no territory can
be "automatically excluded" from Mid
dle East peace talks. He specifically men
tioned the occupied West Bank of the Jor
dan River, an area claimed by both Tel
Aviv and the Arab states.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin said his government would be ex

tremely reluctant to yield the West Bank
because it is part of historical Israel.
He said his people paid dearly to recap
ture the land during the Six Day War in
1967.
Carter's warning was criticized by Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y ), an avowed Israel
supporter. He called the administration's
announcement "unrealistic" and likely to
increase rather than ease war tensions.
Attorney ads allowed
Washington — The Supreme Court de
cided 5-4 yesterday to allow lawyers to
advertise their fees for routine jobs like
drawing up wills or handling uncon
tested divorces.
The court ruled state laws prohibiting
such advertising violated the First
Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
Its majority decision said "it is entirely
possible that advertising will serve to re
duce, not advance, the cost of legal ser
vices to the consumer."
According to Justice Harry Blackmun's
opinion, the court found publicizing
prices is not inherently misleading, since
only routine services lend themselves to
this treatment. He said though, that "ad
vertising that is false, deceptive, or mis
leading, of course is subject to restraint."
The American Bar Association first re
stricted lawyers' advertisements in 1908
in support of professional dignity. The
ban now is enforced in all states either by
law or by court order.
Fuel standards raised
Washington — Despite complaints
from the auto industry, the Carter ad

ministration has acted to make the
gasoline-efficiency standards tougher in
the years between 1980 and 1985.
Transportation Secretary Brock Adams
Sunday outlined the increased standards
for average fuel economy and noted that
the existing target of 27.5 miles pergallon
by 1985 may be too conservative.
In a television interview, Adams said
that existing mileage standards "are read
ily achievable with presently known
technology, and the prospect of further
fuel economy improvements through ad
ditional weight reductions and alterna
tive engines supports the need for con
sidering higher fuel economy require
ments for 1985 and beyond."
Adams announced that cars already re
quired to average 20 m.p.g. in 1980 will
be required to average 22 m.p.g. for model
year 1981, 24 m.p.g. for 1982, 26 m.p.g.
for 1983, and 27 m.p.g. for 1984 models.
He added that 1C billion gallons of
gasoline a day would be eventually saved
as a result of the standards, and consum
ers would save $1000 in the cost of
gasoline over the life of a car.
The Big Four automakers say they lack
the money and know-how to meet exist
ing average fuel-consumption standards
and air-pollution requirements while still
designing marketable cars.

43 killed in prison fire
Columbia. Tenn. —43 inmates were
killed in a fire at the Maury County jail
here during visiting hours Sunday. The
fire began in a padded cell, and the smoke
was pumped through the jail by the
prison ventilating system. Most of the vic
tims died through asphyxiation within
four minutes.
At the time of the fire, about 150 per
sons were in the jail, 64 of them prisoners.
None of the visitors were reported in
jured.
Bill Walter administrator of the Maury
County Hospital, said 70 persons were
taken there for treatment, and that 43 of
them, including five women, were dead
of smoke inhalation.
Dep. William Duke said the fire
"started back there in this cell and appa
rently went into the ventilation system. It
just filled the building with smoke."
He also said that when the prisoners
began screaming, jailer Jerry Dickey
grabbed the keys to the cellblock. As he
ran to the door to the visiting area, the
door flew open and visitors came flowing
out.
"Everybody panicked." Duke said.
"They just knocked the keys out of his
hand."
With the thick smoke, it took 12 mi
nutes to find the keys, he said, and by that
timefiremen had begun breaking through
the outside walls.
It took the firemen two hours to control
the fire, and Fire Capt. Mac Craft said,
"We had many, many persons die."
Carter warns Israelis
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
told Israel yesterday that no territory can
be "automatically excluded" from Mid
dle East peace talks. He specifically men
tioned the occupied West Bank of the Jor
dan River, an area claimed by both Tel
Aviv and the Arab states.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin said his government would be ex

tremely reluctant to yield the West Bank
because it is part of historical Israel.
He said his people paid dearly to recap
ture the land during the Six Day War in
1967.
Carter's warning was criticized by Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y ), an avowed Israel
supporter. He called the administration's
announcement "unrealistic" and likely to
increase rather than ease war tensions.
Attorney ads allowed
Washington — The Supreme Court de
cided 5-4 yesterday to allow lawyers to
advertise their fees for routine jobs like
drawing up wills or handling uncon
tested divorces.
The court ruled state laws prohibiting
such advertising violated the First
Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
Its majority decision said "it is entirely
possible that advertising will serve to re
duce, not advance, the cost of legal ser
vices to the consumer."
According to Justice Harry Blackmun's
opinion, the court found publicizing
prices is not inherently misleading, since
only routine services lend themselves to
this treatment. He said though, that "ad
vertising that is false, deceptive, or mis
leading, of course is subject to restraint."
The American Bar Association first re
stricted lawyers' advertisements in 1908
in support of professional dignity. The
ban now is enforced in all states either by
law or by court order.
Fuel standards raised
Washington — Despite complaints
from the auto industry, the Carter ad

ministration has acted to make the
gasoline-efficiency standards tougher in
the years between 1980 and 1985.
Transportation Secretary Brock Adams
Sunday outlined the increased standards
for average fuel economy and noted that
the existing target of 27.5 miles pergallon
by 1985 may be too conservative.
In a television interview, Adams said
that existing mileage standards "are read
ily achievable with presently known
technology, and the prospect of further
fuel economy improvements through ad
ditional weight reductions and alterna
tive engines supports the need for con
sidering higher fuel economy require
ments for 1985 and beyond."
Adams announced that cars already re
quired to average 20 m.p.g. in 1980 will
be required to average 22 m.p.g. for model
year 1981, 24 m.p.g. for 1982, 26 m.p.g.
for 1983, and 27 m.p.g. for 1984 models.
