Saturday morning, 9:15 a.m.. I
was sitting on the floor of my
apartment, barely awake, watch
ing the Bugs Bunny Road Run
ner Hour on TV.
I heard the phone ring next
door in the office of the Herald,
my place of employment. 1 grab
bed my robe and stumbled
through the door which (to my
increasing disgust) connects the
office to my apartment. Honest,
there's a door between the two
bathrooms.
After a couple of tries, I found
the phone and answered it. Who
the hell would call a weekly
newspaper at the crack of dawn
on Saturday?
A woman's voice:
"Hello, I'd like to cancel a
classified ad in your paper."
Jesus.
Okay, what did it say?
"It said, 'Wanted: Parts from
old Westinghouse dryer with
slant front — approximately
15-20 years old.' "
I remembered the ad: the office
manager had read it to me chuck
ling when it was first submitted.
Had she found the parts?
"Yes. this lady called up right
away, and she had a whole dryer
that still works. She told me ev
erything works including the
buzzer."
The buzzer?
"That's why I wanted the
dryer. The buzzer plays "How
Dry I Am" when the clothes are
done. No one believed me when I
said they used to make dryers
like that, so I'm going to take the
buzzer out and put it in mv own

dryer."
A whole dryer just for the buz
zer?
"For $20, I figure it was a
pretty good investment. Besides
the dryer itself is a collectors
item."
"I took down her name and
number, said goodbye as calmly
as I could, and went back to my
apartment.
Mrs. kubalik was happier be
cause her dryer buzzes "How Dry
1 Am" when her undies aredone.
Some how Bugs Bunny just
wasn't the same anymore.
I Dave Ansley is a Daily staffer,
majoring in communication,
currently employed at a thing
called the Kitsap County Herald
in ci place called Port Orchard,
Washington. He is the reporter,
photographer and part-time de
livery boy and he reports that he
was recently "promoted to
