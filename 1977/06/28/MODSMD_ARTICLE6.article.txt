# RAPE: A crime of violence
##

Io prevent rape in the street,
women are told to stay at home at
night, avoid confining clothing
and be prepared to run at any
moment.
To prevent rape at home,
women are told to lock doors
with heavy bolts and to install
steel on windows.
The police, the ones who usu
ally issue these precautions,
don't offer advice on how
women can conduct their lives if
they cannot go out at night, nor
do they say how a woman can
afford the costly protective de
vices they recommend.
Actually, there is more than a
monetary price attached to these
precautions. The women who
take this advice, who change
their clothing styles and im
prison themselves within their
own homes, are already paying

the price of fear. And their fear is
well-founded.
Recent research on rape shows
that one out of every 10 women
can expect to be raped within her
lifetime. The youngest victim on
record was six months The
oldest victim was 90. Most rape
victims, however, are between
the ages of 18 and 24.
Rape is the most frequently
committed violent crime in the
United States, and is also the
least reported crime. For each
reported case, the FBI estimates
there are seven which go unre
ported.
In all states except California,
the victim can be cross
examined about hep previous
sexual history. If she is not a vir
gi n, her story can be discredited,
and the rapist may be acquitted,
or the rape charge dropped al
together.
Another reason for low report
ing of the crime was eloquently
stated in May by a Wisconsin
judge', who said rape is "nor
mal, and added, "whether you
like it or not, women are sex ob
jects. Why would a woman re
port rape when she will be con
fronted with a judicial system
which will discredit her or say
the crime against her is normal?
Perhaps the Wisconsin judge
knows what he is talking about.
Perhaps he has read recent
studies of convicted rapists,
which show that researchers
have been unable to detect any
psychological abnormality that
would set raping men apart from
those who do not rape.
In practical terms, for women,
these findings mean that any
male is a potential rapist.
Moreover, it is not a crime of
passion, in which the poor fel
low is overcome by lust, giving

way to his base instincts with a
lost cry of, "I can't resist your
charms!" Current FBI statistics
show that 70% of all rapes are
planned well in advance. So
what we have is large numbers of
normal males cold-bloodedly
plotting to commit violence
against women.
Our society oppresses women,
however much we want to pat
ourselves on the back for "lib
erty," "freedom" and "equal
ity." Rape is a tool of this oppres
sion, though we have always de
nied it.
"Only perverts and sickies are
rafpists," we have said. The
studies prove us liars.
We have also denied that the
male is to blame, saying, "She
was asking for it." But the statis
tics prove us liars.
In fact, all the "knowledge"
we have amassed about rape is
being empirically proven false.
It is convenient to our biases, but
false, all the same.
Women are not raped out of
sexual desire, but out of the de
sire by men to exert power, to
humiliate and degrade. This is
directly related to the quality we
admire, even cultivate, in our
male children — aggression.
We teach boys to use physical
force, to dominate, to exert their
wills over others, and we have
only ourselves to blame when
they interpret the lesson in a lit
eral way, a way which leads to
rape.
Margaret Mead discovered a
NewOuinea tribe which had no
concept for rape, proving biol
ogy is not responsible for the
crime. So much for the testos
terone theories.
Rape is a crime of violence
more than it is a sex crime. Every
