a gay San Francisco gar
r' Hillsborough's death
n everybody's mind,
left flowers for him on
' s steps. They waved

banners and chanted "He died
for us. Let's fight for him."
Others were out for personal
reasons. "I'm not here to cut
down Anita. I'm not here to
mourn Robert. I'm here because
I'm gay and I want everyone to
know I'm not ashamed," a
marcher explained.
People around him cheered
and raised their fists. "For once
everyone's all together," said
one participant. "This is great.
Usually, men and us have trou
ble getting on with each other.
But today the sun is shining,
everybody's shouting. We're
showing the world what it
means."
Her female companion agreed,
saying "This is like no other de
monstration I've been too. It's a
lot quieter but not ugly. It makes
a bigger point."
Another marcher was not as
confident. "I'm quite disap
pointed by the number of garish
elements we see today." admit
ted a man in a pinstripe suit and
Cardin sunglasses. "The TV will
no doubt concentrate on these
Halloween characters and the
pseudo-Rose Bowl atmosphere.
The message is lost."
To him the parade should
have been serious and more
structured. "With 100,000 we
could have taken city hall. We
could have proved that we're
talking human rights, not please
don't feed the animals. The pat
ronizing mentality has to be de
stroyed. And we could have
done it today."

Many spectators found the
parade carnival-like. With hot
dog vendors and press photo
graphers "I could swear this was
Hollywood or Disneyland" said
a popcorn-eating curbsitter.
"Transpose this in your mind
and — hell, it's a fantasy."
Behind him, a middle-aged
couple from Wisconsin was tak
ing pictures. The two went wild
as the floats bobbed along,
flower-covered caravans ridden
by male Cleopatras.
Two gay men who had come
only to watch threw confetti

whenever a float passed. "Beaut
iful aren't they?" one asked,
laughing when he saw his audi
ence's stunned faces. "We aren't
going to bite," he assured the
women around him.
A Bush Street policeman ad
mitted, "I'd rather be doing
something else. All leave for
cops was canceled today. Other
than that, this is pretty ordi
nary."
He said no violence was ex
pected and none had occurred.
"We have people stationed
everywhere in case something

does go down, but it's only a pre
caution."
A gay marcher, passing him,
yelled, "That's right. You won't
get anything this time." He later
explained "Our intent today was
to get out and be visible. To at
tract attention. The effect of this
parade will be like no other."
"It's a triumph," a woman
shouted, waving her "1 hate
Anita" poster.
"All 1 can say," a broom
carrying shopkeeper sighed, "is
that this'll be hell to clean up."
