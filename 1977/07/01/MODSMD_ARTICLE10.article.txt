# Hoover expert critiques Social Security
## 
### Bill Wien 
Carter administration propos
als could make Social Security
in almost all respects a welfare
system, a Hoover Institution ex
pert warns.
Rita Ricardo Campbell, senior
fellow at Hoover and author of
Social Security: Promise and
Reality, recently testified before
the Senate Subcommittee on So
cial Security.
Begun in 1935, the Social
Security system was seen as a
compulsory public retirement/
insurance plan for workers who
might not otherwise save
enough for a post-retirement in
come.
Campbell said she believes the
original philosophy was lost "as
early as 1939 when the act was
drastically amended to add de
pendency benefits." These bo
netits go to certain relatives of
workers.
Phase out
In her testimony, Campbell re
commended phasing out retired
Spouses secondary benefits over
a 30-year period and surviving
spouses secondary benefits over
a 30-year period.
I As early as 1968, almost 70
per cent of women were entitled
f 0 a primary (Social Security)
penefit based on their own earn-
p s '"jhe noted. "8y1990, less
pn 15 years hence, over 90 per
ent of women will be entitled to
® primary benefit."
She said it would be necessary
J retain secondary benefits for
L' , L arui a ged parents and
e that it welfare for some
5 ( Pr persons is needed, benefits

under the now-established Sup
plemental Security Income
program are available.
She also recommended "de
coupling," an end to the double
counting of inflation in comput
ing Social Security benefits, cal
ling it the result of a "technical
error that Congress did not un
derstand."
Since 1972 inflation has been
counted twice in the computa
tion of benefits, she said. "There
is agreement on it (decoupling)
and it would reduce the long-run
actuarial imbalance by about one
half," she noted.
Not the intent
Without decoupling, she said,
"In perhaps 15 years many
people will have more in Social
Security benefits, if we let the
system alone and inflation con
tinues, than they have in net
earnings after taxes — and that
cannot be the intent of any type
of system of this sort."
Another change Campbell ad
vocated is the expansion of So
cial Security to include all gov
ernment employes. "As long as
some jobs are covered and others
are not, and as long as earning
entitlement is $3 per week,
people can play the system for
individual gain. This is unfair to
future generations," she de
clared.
Exemption of government
workers adds to the "distrust by
the public as to the viability of
the system and creates resent
ment when their Social Security
taxes are increased," she added.
Over the next four years, Car
ter administration proposals

would add more than $30 billion
to employer taxes by taxing total
payrolls. The proposals would
also add $3.5 billion to employe
Social Security payments.
Total taxes
In families where both a hus
band and wife earned $30,300 by
1985, their Social Security taxes
would total $3545 annually and
employers would pay the match
ing amount.
"Economists are in agreement
that employers do not pay in
creases in pay Toll taxes out of
profits," she noted. Rather,
employers "as fast as possible
shift the tax primarily onto their
employes either through lower
wage rates than otherwise would
occur or by hiring fewer workers
and, secondarily, by increasing
prices to the consumer."
She said, "I think if you have
to have 13 loose-leaf volumes ac
ross a desk like this to explain or
give an answer to people, it's
ridiculous — people are not wil
ling to be taxed for what they
don't understand."
When Social Security was
adopted, few workers were elig
ible for retirement benefits and
the ratio of taxpaying workers to
beneficiaries was large. By the
19505, the ratio of workers to be
neficiaries was four to one and
may be down to about two to one
in 50 years.
Present trends
If present demographic trends
continue, said Campbell, "You
either have to raise more money
or you have to slim down be
nefits or both.
"Most people just address

'How do we tax more?' and not
the fact that the post-war boom
babies are going to become the
aged in 30 years hence. At the
same time, they will be sup
ported by a shrinking popula
tion of younger persons.
"Even if we try to raise more
taxes we will be raising them
from relatively fewer people,
and that's why I got the idea of
phasing out dependency be
nefits of women. Also, the fact is
that most women work," she ad
ded.

The real inequity of the ad
ministration proposal, accord
ing to Campbell, is that it
changes entitlement rules for
secondary benefits for married
women. "It proposes that they
prove dependency. Now they do
not have to prove dependency,"
she said.
The proposals also continue
"the existing inequity for two
married people, each of whom
work," she said.

End of the ivy
The Old Union exterior is being cleaned and prepared for a
new coat of paint by sandblasting, according to Jason
Mavis, plant services director. Most of the ivy on the build
ing is going for good, Mavis said. Ivy is "very invasive,"
Mavis said, noting that it can "grow under tiles and tear
them off the roof."
