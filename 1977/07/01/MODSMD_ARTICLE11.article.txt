# Prof defends recombinant DNA work

Scientists have been honest and reasona
ble in bringing public attention to the poten
tial dangers of recombinant DNA research,
but no actual dangers have been found, Biol
ogy Prof. Robert Schimke said Wednesday
night.
In a speech at Skilling Auditorium,
Schimke emphasized that experimental
techniques such as taking apart a DNA
molecule and stitching it back together again
could be done without concern. The
techniques are simple and inexpensive, he
said. "If you know the techniques, you'd
know it's not dangerous."
Knowing the DNA sequence makes it possi
ble to replicate large amounts of the or
ganism.
Possible hazards in experiments involving

some genetic combinations led scientists to
call for a moratorium in 1975 and 1976.
The creation of disease-causing or
ganisms, toxic substances and penicillin re
sistance were cause for concern.
The National Institute of Health set
guidelines to match the level of containment
with the level of anticipated danger. Con
tainment procedures specify strict laborat
ory conditions to protect against unknown
hazards as well as low level risks.
Not only must researchers get approval
from the funding agency, but they must meet
up to the containment levels specified in the
federal guidelines, said Schimke.
Those with commercial interests such as
drug companies and private researchers not
under NIH supervision need to be brought
under control, he said.

The stringent conditions required for re
combinant DNA experiments makes it im
possible for bacteria to escape, said Schimke.
He said he was convinced that biologically
weakened bacteria or "crippled hosts" used
for dangerous experiments would not sur
vive in an environment outside of the
laboratory.
Other criticism about recombinant DNA
researchers "tampering with evolution and
playing God" or causing mutations were un
founded, Schimke said. It is unlikely that a
single sequence of DNA can change the
human evolution, he said.
He said scare tactics and scenarios only
cause misunderstanding. We are exchang
ing genetic information with other or
ganisms all the time, Schimke said.
