# Private money production urged by Nobel laureate
## 
### George Anders 
Imagine walking into a local
store and being able to pay with
money issued by the Bank of
Menlo Park, an international
bank or many other competitors
to the U.S. dollar.
That was the scenario urged
by economics Nobel laureate
F.A. Hayek in a speech Tuesday
at the Hoover Institution.
Hayek called for an end to
government monopolies on the
production of money, saying
that competition in issuing
money would be a "radical cure"
for world economic woes.
Currently the United States
and most other nations allow
only a central government bank
to produce money.
Hayek said his proposal
"would offer a fully effective
solution to all our monetary
troubles."

"Historically, government has
only abused its power" to create
money, Hayek said, "and has de
frauded people. Government has
used its coinage privilege only to
make a profit and never to pro
vide good money."
However, he said, private
firms that issued currency
would issue "good money" that
would not depreciate in value
because providing "good
money" would be a "question of
life and death."
"A very complex learning
process will be involved" in the
transition from current monet
ary systems to the type he advo
cates, Hayek said.
But he predicted that after a
few months of "experimenta
tion," stores would carry lists of
which currencies they would
accept, and consumers would be
little inconvenienced.

Competing currencies woul
be pegged to different standard
he said. Some would be ei
changable for governmen
issued currency, others woul
be tied to a commodity priceii
dex.
That second option woulß
produce a currency with coi
stant purchasing power -tl
money most people would vvai
to hold, he said,
"I have not yet encountered
single theoretical objection t
the notion of having privat
firms issue money. Hayek sail
Most objections have centere
on political difficulties in in
plementing the plan, h>
explained.
"1 always believe in makin
politically possible what seem
politically impossible," he sail
Hayek said it he were to issu
currency, he would use a beaut
iful name I am keeping secret
In addition to the emergent)
of stable currencies, Havel
claimed his plan has a seconi
benefit — preventing govern
ments from spending more b]
printine more money,
"Cutting off government fron
the tap may prove as importan
in stopping tendencies touari
unlimited government" as pro
viding new currencies, hesai
"The one thing a governmen
of a free country must not be al
lowed to possess is a prinHJ
press by which it can iss
money for whatever purpose
wants," he added.
Hayek received the <
Nobel Prize in economics, an
was made an honorary te
the Hoover Institution following
his speech.
