The AAUP through the Fa-
Bty Senate, is pressing for full
Iclosure of faculty members'
aries. Because of the AAUP,

averages, minimum and
maximum salaries have been
published, Edwards said. The
AAUP's goal is to have every
professor's salary published, he
added.
The theory behind this aim is
that if a professor does not know
other professors' salaries he may
not be getting what he wants or
deserves, Edwards said. If one's
salary is abnormally low, it may
be because the department
chairman "doesn't think you're
any good," he asserted.
If a salary is low for good
reason, a professor can improve
his performance. If the salary is
unjustifiably low, he can file a
grievance.
Paranoia
"I'm not certain that there's a
big problem at Stanford, but

some people get paranoid about
it," Edwards said.
The AAUP will listen to any
professor who has a grievance,
be he a member or not, Edwards
said.
The AAUP was active in 1976
when Belgian economist Ernest
Mandel, who was offered a guest
professorship here, was denied a
visa by the United States.
The AAUP recently fought an
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
proposal to tax the free or par
tially free tuition allowed to fa
culty children at various univer
sities. The IRS backed down.
The AAUP also took action
when New York City laid off
some of its city college profes
sors in response to the city's
monetary crisis.
