There's beer here!
After about two years of trying, TDS Inc., the private
company that runs the Transition and Encina Commons,
has finally started selling beer at the Commons
The Commons remains open to minors, although beer is
sold only to those 21 and over. TDS has been seeking a beer
license for either its Tresidder outlets or for the Commons
since 1975.
