# An 'anti-theater' theater
## Wirth on Brecht 
### 
Brechtian scholar Andrzej
YVirth leads a summer seminar
on the Lehrstuck, a learning
play. His class concentrates on
the "Fatzer" material — un
edited, unpublished dramatic
commentaries, and the begin
nings of a play foreshadowing
The Measures Taken.
Wirth said critics ignored
these documents because they
appear to be "etudes for the ac
tor." But he believes their expo
sure here, equivalent to a pro
duction's world premiere, will
be "unique and very special" to
Brechtian study.
He pointed out Brecht called
the "Fatzer" material one of his
three most important projects.
"That intrigued me," he admit
ted, leading him to extensive re
search and the Stanford seminar.
Wirth plans an "anti-theater"
approach to the "Fatzer" play
excerpts. He will not stage a for
mal production nor will he act as
director of the workshop. He

does not want auditions, players
who "act" or other theater con
ventions.
Instead, he will use Brecht's
true didactic style, one he says
the playwright himself never
could follow.
As a Polish drama critic and
play translator, Wirth developed
Brecht's influence in Eastern
Europe during the 1950s and
19605. As a professor at colleges
including Princeton, Harvard
and Stanford (1967-70), he has
brought his Brecht interpreta
tions to America.
Wirth worked with Brecht at
the Berliner Ensemble during
the playwright's last year.
He is currently a professor at

the Free University of Berlin in
West Germany.
Wirth on Brecht:
(edited from an interview)
The play excerpts
Brecht wrote "Fatzer" bet
ween 1926-31, an important
period — his Marxist indoctrina
tion— which had a big influence
on the play.
It opens as a traditional
soldiers-returning-from-war
play. Four soldiers return to
Germany from World War I.
They're going underground —
desertion brought on by
radicalization They start a col
lective with Fatzer (an egoist) as
the leader.
They must rely on each other
to survive. They try to combine
Fatzer's interest in himself with
his interest in others. But he be
comes dangerous. The play ends
with Fatzer's execution — the
three others kill him.

Brecht had strange strategies
(in dealing with ideological
problems); he used extreme
cases of negativity. Negative
heroes like Puntila or Mother
Courage. One studies Fatzer to
criticize him. He is bad — an
egoist — no socialist.
The four soldiers live in an
almost Beckettian situation of
conspiracy, desperation, under
ground living. Fatzer does not
accept this. For instance, he goes
on a stroll through the city. It's
outrageous. It breaks the collec
tive's solidarity, the esthetic
naivete in this scene. His egoism
and his behavior expose the col
lective to danger. How to use
Fatzer for the benefit of the col
lective (becomes a problem).
Fatzer's execution is like all
Lehrstucke executions. The vic
tim must say "yes" to dying —

the eim erstandnis -
cence. He must agree 1
killing, with what soc
mands. It is a delicate]
The study of acquiescen
study of boundaries off
the problems of survive
the collective.
The approach
My concept is to do'

dactic style.
We would use differs

The results could be 1
