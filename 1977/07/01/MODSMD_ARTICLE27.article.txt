# The 						Bacchae' SRO
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
Classical theater is playing to
SRO crowds as the Bureau of
Western Mythology presents
Euripedes' The Bacchae at the
Palo Alto Cultural Center.
The three performances last
weekend sold out, said Peggy
Scott, who plays one of the three
daughters of Cadmus driven
mad in a revenge of the god
Dionysus. She advised would-be
playgoers to purchase tickets in
advance for the July 1-4,8 and 9
performances.
In addition, she said, ar
rangements are being made with
Palo Alto to extend the play's
run by up to three weeks because
of the high attendance. The ex
tension has not yet been con
firmed, howerver.
The play revolves around the
wine god Dionysus' introduc
tion of frenzied, hedonistic bac
chic rites into ancient Thebes
despite the resistance of the ci
ty's king, Pentheus. The god in
fects Thebes' female population
with an ecstatic possession
which leads them to revel in the
mountains around the city.
To create the ancient setting,
the experimental theater com
pany's set designer, John Pro

sise, has constructed an outdoor
sculpture of the craggy moun
tain area in the cultural center's
patio where the play is per
formed. The center has never be
fore been used for what the com
pany calls an "environmental
performance."
Almost all the cast and the
bulk of the production crew are
associated with the University.
Frosise and director Richard
Carp are former students, while
choreographer Elizabeth Larkam
and lighting designer Wendy
Hefner are currently enrolled,
Scott said.
The company, which is af
filiated with the Council for the
Arts, Palo Alto and Midpenin
sula Area, dates back to 1971
when productions began on
campus. In 1972, thegroup went
professional and took "Robin," a
popular show on campus, to San
Francisco.
Returningto Stanford in 1973,
the company moved off campus
and took the title of Bureau of
Western Mythology in Sep
tember 1975. It has been giving
performances in Palo Alto since
that time and has received sup
port from the Palo Alto city Arts
Department.

Mythology at the Palo Alto Cultural Center.
