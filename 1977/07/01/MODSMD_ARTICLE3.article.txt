# Summer law may close

The Law School may discon
tinue summer course offerings
after this year due to low student
enrollment, according to Assoc.
Law School Dean J. Steven
Mann.
For 25 years, the Law School
has offered summer courses
taught by such notables as
former Watergate prosecutor Ar
chibald Cox and constitutional
law scholar Alexander Bickel.
"Our unequaled program has
fallen into a poor cost/benefit
ratio," Mann said.
Students are "choosing in
creasingly available summer
employment opportunities in
legal career fields," he
explained, rather than speeding
their graduation through sum
mer study.
Total enrollment in law clas
ses this summer is about .')(),
Mann said. This is less than halt
of peak enrollment during the
late 1950s and early 19605, he
added.
75 per cent drop
Enrollment of Stanford stu
dents has dropped even more —
about 75 per cent since those
peak years, he noted. Some ot
this slack has been picked up by
an increase in the number of stu
dents from other schools, Mann
said.

But this year, only 15 students
from other schools preregis
tered. Mann said this occurred
despite a substantial recruitment
effort which sent fliers to 200
law schools across the country.
Visiting students vary geog
raphically from Cornell Univer
sity and the University of Puerto
Rico in the east to the University
of San Fernando Valley and the
University of Wyoming in the
west.
More law schools are now of
fering competing summer prog
rams than before, Mann noted.
He said this competition also
contributes to the summer en
rollment decline here.
"We are unaccustomed to
competing for students," Mann
said, pointing out that over 3000
persons apply for the 165 posi
tions in entering fall classes.
"As to visiting professors, it
has largely been a question of
who we want, he said.
Faculty
This summer's visiting faculty
is comprised of Edward Sher
man, professor at Indiana Uni
versity School of Law; Martin
Redish. associate professor at
Northwestern University School
of Law; Roger Park, associate
professor at the University of
Minnesota L.aw School; and
Gary Schwartz, protessor at

UCLA. Sherman, Redish, Park
and Schwartz each teach a single
course this summer in their re
spective fields. All four are
honor graduates of the Harvard
University Law School.
According to Mann, an alter
native to discontinuing all
courses next summer would be
to offer specially designed clas
ses open to undergraduates.
Mann noted that Cornell Law
School had already sponsored
such a successful summer prog
ram and that Stanford Law
School Profs. John Kaplan.
Robert Rabin, and William
Cohen had already taught simi
lar classes to undergraduates
here during the regular school
year.
Programs unaffected
In any event, Mann said the
scholar in residence program
and other regular activity at the
law school next summer will not
be affected. The scholar in resi
dence program brings a noted
academician in law or related
fields to do research at the law
school.
This summer the scholar in re
sidence is economist Paul Jas
kow, who is doing research in
antitrust problem areas.

This summer's visiting faculty
is comprised of Edward Sher
man, professor at Indiana Uni
versity School of Law; Martin
Redish. associate professor at
Northwestern University School
of Law; Roger Park, associate
professor at the University of
Minnesota L.aw School; and
Gary Schwartz, protessor at

UCLA. Sherman, Redish, Park
and Schwartz each teach a single
course this summer in their re
spective fields. All four are
honor graduates of the Harvard
University Law School.
According to Mann, an alter
native to discontinuing all
courses next summer would be
to offer specially designed clas
ses open to undergraduates.
Mann noted that Cornell Law
School had already sponsored
such a successful summer prog
ram and that Stanford Law
School Profs. John Kaplan.
Robert Rabin, and William
Cohen had already taught simi
lar classes to undergraduates
here during the regular school
year.
Programs unaffected
In any event, Mann said the
scholar in residence program
and other regular activity at the
law school next summer will not
be affected. The scholar in resi
dence program brings a noted
academician in law or related
fields to do research at the law
school.
This summer the scholar in re
sidence is economist Paul Jas
kow, who is doing research in
antitrust problem areas.
The Law School may discon
tinue summer course offerings
after this year due to low student
enrollment, according to Assoc.
Law School Dean J. Steven
Mann.
For 25 years, the Law School
has offered summer courses
taught by such notables as
former Watergate prosecutor Ar
chibald Cox and constitutional
law scholar Alexander Bickel.
"Our unequaled program has
fallen into a poor cost/benefit
ratio," Mann said.
Students are "choosing in
creasingly available summer
employment opportunities in
legal career fields," he
explained, rather than speeding
their graduation through sum
mer study.
Total enrollment in law clas
ses this summer is about .')(),
Mann said. This is less than halt
of peak enrollment during the
late 1950s and early 19605, he
added.
75 per cent drop
Enrollment of Stanford stu
dents has dropped even more —
about 75 per cent since those
peak years, he noted. Some ot
this slack has been picked up by
an increase in the number of stu
dents from other schools, Mann
said.

But this year, only 15 students
from other schools preregis
tered. Mann said this occurred
despite a substantial recruitment
effort which sent fliers to 200
law schools across the country.
Visiting students vary geog
raphically from Cornell Univer
sity and the University of Puerto
Rico in the east to the University
of San Fernando Valley and the
University of Wyoming in the
west.
More law schools are now of
fering competing summer prog
rams than before, Mann noted.
He said this competition also
contributes to the summer en
rollment decline here.
"We are unaccustomed to
competing for students," Mann
said, pointing out that over 3000
persons apply for the 165 posi
tions in entering fall classes.
"As to visiting professors, it
has largely been a question of
who we want, he said.
