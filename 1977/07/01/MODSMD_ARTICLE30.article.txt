Carter kills B1 bomber
Washington — President Carter
said yesterday in a nationally broadcast
news conference that, "we should not
continue with production" of the B1
bomber, while recommending that test
ing and research continue.
Instead of the costly $101.7 million
planes, Carter said he has decided that the
United States should begin deployment
of the Cruise missile in both airborne and
submarine-launched versions.
Although Carter's decision is counter
to the latest congressional vote on the
bomber, he said he hoped Congress will
go along with what he called "one of the
hardest decisions" he has made si nee tak
ing office,
The President said that his decision on
the Bl might show the Soviet Union that
the administration is striving for progress
in the SALT talks.
"I can't deny that was a factor." Carter
said. He also indicated that there always
exists the possibility that he could revive
Bl production should relations with
Moscow deteriorate. However, Carter
doesn't expect that to happen.
- With his decision to stop Bl produc
tion, Carter reaffirmed one of his early
campaign positions. He had then de
clared that the Bl bomber would oe a
waste of the taxpayers money.
But Carter said that he was not guided
by his campaign position. Rather, he said
that his decision was based upon the be
lief that the cruise missile is an adequate
strategic weapon.
The verdict against the bomber was
supported bySecretaryofDefense Harold
Brown.

Mainland China ties sought
Washington — In a news conference
yesterday. President Carter expressed his
hopes for working out an agreement with
mainland China which would establish
full diplomatic relations.
Simultaneously, Carter indicated that
formal ties with Taiwan would be cut, but
that trade, cultural and social exchanges
would be maintained.
U.S. ties with the Nationalists have
been a major block to improving relations
with the Communist mainland.
Carter said the current U.S. security
pact with Taiwan poses a "difficult ques
tion." But he said he is hoping that full
relations can be established with Peking
"while making sure the peaceful lives of
the Taiwanese are maintained."
"That is our hope and that is our goal."
he added.
A final decision may be reached after
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance visits
Peking in late August, Carter said.
The United States is one of less than
two dozen countries which presently
maintains full diplomatic relations with
the Taiwan government.
Human rights trial starts
Moscow — Two human rights ac
tivists have gone to trial in a sealed

makeshift courtroom in the Ukraine, fel
low dissidents reported Wednesday.
Mikola Rudenko and Oleksa Tikhy, Uk
ranian branch members of a group
monitoring Soviet compliance with the
Helsinki accords on human rights, have
been charged v\ ith "anti-Soviet activity,"
and went on trial June 23 in the town of
Druzhkovskv. dissidents said.
They said the trial was being held in a
factory's Red Corner." a place were
ceremonies and Communist party ac
tivities are usually held.
According to former Maj. Cen. Pytor
Grigorenko, head of the Moscow monitor
ing branch, the room was packed with
KGB agents and "even relatives were not
let in," including Tikhy's 80 vear-old
mother.
"The purpose, of course, is to hush up
everything that is happening there so that
we here in Moscow don't know,"
Grigorenko said.
The prosecution has demanded that
Rudenko be sentenced to seven years in a
labor camp and five years in exile and
Tikhy 10 years in prison and five in exile.
Soviet authorities have apparently
sought to break up the monitoring groups
before this month's Belgrade conference,
a preparatory session for this fall's review
of the Helsinki accords.
