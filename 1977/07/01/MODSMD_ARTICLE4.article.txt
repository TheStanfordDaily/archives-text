# Protesters plan innocent pleas
## 
### Randy Keith 
All of the 229 South Africa
protesters who have yet to enter
pleas in connection with their
arrest May 9 in Old Union will
probably plead innocent at their
court appearances scheduled for
today, according to one of the
group's defense lawyers.
"Everybody's pleading not
guilty and are prepared to go
through whatever trial is neces
sary unless authorities in this
county come up with some kind
of reasonable disposition of the
case," said Martin Eichner. one
of 20 lawyers for the protesters.
"What happened in Santa
Cruz County is somewhat the
idea of what we consider to be a
reasonable disposition of the
case," Eichner added.
The Santa Cruz County Dis
trict Attorney's Office recently
dropped charges against 401
protesters who were arrested at
UC-Santa Cruz on May 2(i fol
lowing a sit-in similar to the one
here.

Ten of the 294 protesters ar
rested here have already pleaded
innocent and will have a trial
date set today unless they
change their plea to guilty, ac
cording to a spokesperson at the
county clerk's office.
However, the public defender
representing 9 of the 10 said he
would ask for an extension of
time before a trial date is set.
Most of the other 55 de
monstrators have either pleaded
no contest, or guilty, and have
been placed on six months prob
ation and fined $65 by Munici
pal Court Judge Edward Scoyen.
The 294 protesters were ar
rested following a 16-hour sit-in
at Old Union to protest Univer
sity investments in companies
that have investments in South
Africa.
The arrests came when de
monstrators refused to leave the
building after being told to do so
by police. They were charged
with two counts of trespassing
and with failure to disperse on
the order of police. De
monstrators then either signed
misdemeanor citations at the
scene or were released on their
own recognizance after being
booked at the Elmwood Re
habilitation Facility in Milpitas.
That same day the Board of
Trustees had voted not to recon
sider its decision to abstain from
voting on a Ford Motor Com
pany proxy resolution. The re
solution, which failed over
whelmingly, would have man
dated that the company with
draw investments in South Af
rica.
The trustees did meet two of
the students demands; thata cost
benefit cost/benefit report on
University investments be pre
pared and that several trustees
meet with students to discuss
investment issues.
A legal defense fund for the
protesters has been established
and according to Eric Berg, trea
surer and a student who was ar
rested, the fundraising goal is
$15,000. "We're getting towards
it, but maybe not as rapidly as
some of us would have liked.
We're making progress though."
he said.
According to Eichner, the
money raised will be divided
among the lawyers depending
on the amount of work each
lawyer does.
The court sessions today will
be at 9 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m.
and 3 p.m. with Scoyen presid
ing.
