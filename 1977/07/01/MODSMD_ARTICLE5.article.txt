Freedom of the media has
once again been curtailed by the
U.S. Supreme Court. It
seems to be in vogue to ignore
the basic first amendment rights
guaranteed to the press in our
Constitution.
The court decided five to four
on Tuesday that a "human can
nonball" can demand damages
from an Ohio television station
that showed his entire act on an
evening newscast.
The suit arose after a freelance
reporter for a Cleveland televi
sion station took pictures with
his movie camera of Hugo Zac
chini's act at a county fair in
1972. Zacchini was shot into a
net from a cannon about 200 feet
away.
The basic issue involves a con
flict between the first amend
ment protection of free press,
and the "right of publicity" af
forded to Zacchini under state
law.
The right of publicity has de
veloped in American law under
the auspices of a right to privacy.
The right to privacy itself is not
specifically guaranteed in the
Constitution or federal laws, but
it was developed in the courts
and state legislatures.
At first, the right to privacy
meant solely the right to be let
alone. It still means just that in
some situations. The court de
cided a few years back that Jac
queline Kennedy Onassis, for in
stance. had the right to be rela
tively free of harassment by a
freelance photographer.
But the right has been ex
tended and applied to many
people in many situations. The
right to privacy evolved in Ohio
into a right of athletes and enter
tainers to their "professional
property." which includes pub
licity.

Zacchini contended that he
had a right to the publicity value
of his 15 second act. Bear in
mind, however, that no separate
fee was charged to see Zacchini's
act at the fair.
Zacchini was giving a public
performance, it seems to me. The
media have every right to report
on public events that they deem
newsworthy. If the public has
the right to see Zacchini's act.
then the media has the right to
report on it. The court, in es
sence. is attempting to tell us
what we can and cannot read ab
out.
And, as Justice Byron White
pointed out. the newscast may
very well have increased the
value of the performance by
stimulating the people's interest
to see it live. Zacchini is knock
ing the free publicity that may
very well be keeping his show
above ground.
The point is that the court has
continued the unfortunate trend
of limiting what legitimately
should be published. Remember
that our founding fathers felt so
strongly that the press should
not be limited that they said just
that in our very first amendment.
They realized that the media
can and should play an impor
tant role in our democracy. They
foresaw that the press can serve
as an effective watchdog on the
government, and that it can con
vey to everyone, including the
newsmakers, what really is
going on.
A free press is necessary for
our country to work, and the
Supreme Court has in the Zac
chini decision, violated our
Constitution as well as en
dangered our rights as citizens to
read the news.
