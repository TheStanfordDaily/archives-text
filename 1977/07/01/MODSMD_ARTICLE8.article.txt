# Laetrile and the FDA
## 
### 
The current debate over the
legal use of laetrile as an anti
cancer agent is one of the most
perplexing problems facing
American medicine. Equally
valid arguments both in favor of
and against the drug have been
advanced by patients, physi
cians, the Food and Drug Ad
minisration, and its manufactur
ers.
The attractiveness of laetrile to
the terminal cancer patient as a
"miracle cure" is understanda
ble. Although palliative and
curative effects of the drug have
been claimed by numerous indi
viduals. it has no proven effec
tiveness in animal studies con
ducted to date. At present, then,
laetrile is best classified as a
placebo, and the issue becomes
whether or not placebos belong
in the physician's armamen
tarium. Lack of an obvious ans
wer to this question is an indica
tion for change in current FDA
policies concerning drug evalu
ation.
At present, the FDA requires
that efficacy of a new agent be
demonstrated in a suitable ani
mal species prior to human test
ing. However, the laetrile con
troversy can only be adequately
resolved through controlled in
vestigation of its true effects in
man. Studies have shown that
the handling of pharmacologic
agents by similar mammalian
species may differ widely, and
laetrile could indeed prove to be
therapeutic in humans. In any
case, once the results of these
trials were made available to the
medical profession and the pa
tient population, the issue
would be solved.
I he need for revision of exist
ing FDA guidelines has also
been recently brought out in the
area of food additive safety. The
threatened saccharin ban and
the demise of cyclamates, both

based on the carcinogenic effects
of massive doses in animals, are
actions which represent un
reasonable extrapolation of ex
perimental findings. Consider
ing the plethora of potential car
cinogens to which we are ex
posed daily in the environment,
such overcautiousness with
regard to additives seems hardly
justifiable.
In addition, current FDA
policies concerning testing and
approval of new therapeutic
agents should be liberalized.
While the existing stringent re
quirements for extensive animal
and human trials virtually in
sure that no harmful agent will
reach the market, the price is a
slow process which excludes
many potentially useful drugs.

The current debate over the
legal use of laetrile as an anti
cancer agent is one of the most
perplexing problems facing
American medicine. Equally
valid arguments both in favor of
and against the drug have been
advanced by patients, physi
cians, the Food and Drug Ad
minisration, and its manufactur
ers.
The attractiveness of laetrile to
the terminal cancer patient as a
"miracle cure" is understanda
ble. Although palliative and
curative effects of the drug have
been claimed by numerous indi
viduals. it has no proven effec
tiveness in animal studies con
ducted to date. At present, then,
laetrile is best classified as a
placebo, and the issue becomes
whether or not placebos belong
in the physician's armamen
tarium. Lack of an obvious ans
wer to this question is an indica
tion for change in current FDA
policies concerning drug evalu
ation.
At present, the FDA requires
that efficacy of a new agent be
demonstrated in a suitable ani
mal species prior to human test
ing. However, the laetrile con
troversy can only be adequately
resolved through controlled in
vestigation of its true effects in
man. Studies have shown that
the handling of pharmacologic
agents by similar mammalian
species may differ widely, and
laetrile could indeed prove to be
therapeutic in humans. In any
case, once the results of these
trials were made available to the
medical profession and the pa
tient population, the issue
would be solved.
