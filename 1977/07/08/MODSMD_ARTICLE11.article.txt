# Boskin calls for price rise
## Econ prof views Palo Alto water rationing 
### Bill Wien 
lilorthern California's second straight
(iter of drought has resulted in man
lory water rationing, which went into
jctin Palo Alto July 1.
pithallotments to be made on a sliding
lebased on last year's consumption for
same month, and with fines for over
isumption, Palo Alto joins most other
linsula cities and water agencies
ich have already started rationing
grams of their own.
lowever, Michael Boskin, assistant
nomics professor, proposes that the
:e of water be allowed to rise to choke
consumer demand. Equating supply
I demand "is much less expensive and
re equitable than most rationing
ernes tend to be," he said.
oskin's scheme would allow transfer
e of rights to the amount of water al-

lowed. "If you want to limit everybody to
a certain number of gallons or a certain
percentage of last year's consumption,"
he said, "then those that go under ought
to be able to sell their excess allotment to
those who want to go over."
'Excess water'
This scheme, according to Boskin,
"would essentially create a price for the
excess water and would tend to approxi
mate the efficiency advantages of a free
market."
Despite the Palo Alto City Councils de
cision to base rationing on last year's con
sumption, an alternate per capita plan has
been kept alive. The contingency plan
would involve a citywide postcard cen
sus to determine the number of residents
per household and the square footage of
landscaped area.
Boskin said his "general feeling is that

water usage is not directly proportional to
the number of people."
But he added that "if you're going to
ration, whether it's per person or per
household or of a certain percentage of
what you used at the same time last year,
the important thing is to create a market
for the excess rights that develop.
'Only half
"If you say to people, 'You get to use
three-quarters of what you used last year
at the same time,' and they could get by by
using only half, then they have no incen
tive to do so,
"But if by using only half they could
sell that extra 25 per cent to people who
need to use more, they do have that incen
tive. The important thing is either to use
the market or to create marketable
coupons or marketable rights."
Though the permissable usage and

fines for over-consumption will first ap
pear on August water bills, Boskin said, "I
do not believe they are going to give a
rebate to those who use below a certain
amount."
Boskin added that he "doubts very
much" that the situation would develop
in which people would be unwilling to
profit by using less water.
He also commented on the fiasco
created when Kenneth Boyd, manager of
the San Francisco Water Department,
warned in a press release that unless San
Franciscans use more water," the city's
water rates might increase again.
"In lieu of letting the price go up I
would just as soon have any deficit the
water department ran made up out of
general revenues rather than having
people go ahead and use more water."

a certain number of gallons or a certain
percentage of last year's consumption,"
he said, "then those that go under ought
to be able to sell their excess allotment to
those who want to go over."
'Excess water'
This scheme, according to Boskin,
"would essentially create a price for the
excess water and would tend to approxi
mate the efficiency advantages of a free
market."
Despite the Palo Alto City Councils de
cision to base rationing on last year's con
sumption, an alternate per capita plan has
been kept alive. The contingency plan
would involve a citywide postcard cen
sus to determine the number of residents
per household and the square footage of
landscaped area.
Boskin said his "general feeling is that

water usage is not directly proportional to
the number of people."
But he added that "if you're going to
ration, whether it's per person or per
household or of a certain percentage of
what you used at the same time last year,
the important thing is to create a market
for the excess rights that develop.
'Only half
"If you say to people, 'You get to use
three-quarters of what you used last year
at the same time,' and they could get by by
using only half, then they have no incen
tive to do so,
"But if by using only half they could
sell that extra 25 per cent to people who
need to use more, they do have that incen
tive. The important thing is either to use
the market or to create marketable
coupons or marketable rights."
Though the permissable usage and

fines for over-consumption will first ap
pear on August water bills, Boskin said, "I
do not believe they are going to give a
rebate to those who use below a certain
amount."
Boskin added that he "doubts very
much" that the situation would develop
in which people would be unwilling to
profit by using less water.
He also commented on the fiasco
created when Kenneth Boyd, manager of
the San Francisco Water Department,
warned in a press release that unless San
Franciscans use more water," the city's
water rates might increase again.
"In lieu of letting the price go up I
would just as soon have any deficit the
water department ran made up out of
general revenues rather than having
people go ahead and use more water."
