The program is not remedial,
said Emily Rosa, A'l O house
mother, adding that these chil
dren are "the best.' They were
chosen from a field of 16,000
students in a region that
stretches from San Mateo to \ en
tura counties.
'Accelerated studies
The program seeks to supple
ment rather than supplant tradi
tional education, Rosa said. Its
aim is to "expose students to ac
celerated studies in a university
environment, and to give them
the opportunity to use their po
tential and to challenge them
heyond what they usually get in
school.
"Hopefully, we will inspire
them to continue on to higher
education," she added.

The students were selected
using criteria such as academic
potential, creativity and special
talents in more than one area,
Rosa said. They have high poten
tials. are fast learners and are
self-motivated, she added.
Guerra said he hopes these
students will serve as peer mod
els and will influence their peers
hv planning to attend college,
seeking scholarships, and ti\ i ng
to develop and achieve personal
success.
No money problems
It is too early to determine the
cost of this year's program, but
Guerra said the projected operat
ing budget is $100,000. Guerra
said no money problems are an
ticipated for next year, and said
