The program is not remedial,
said Emily Rosa, A'l O house
mother, adding that these chil
dren are "the best.' They were
chosen from a field of 16,000
students in a region that
stretches from San Mateo to \ en
tura counties.
'Accelerated studies
The program seeks to supple
ment rather than supplant tradi
tional education, Rosa said. Its
aim is to "expose students to ac
celerated studies in a university
environment, and to give them
the opportunity to use their po
tential and to challenge them
heyond what they usually get in
school.
"Hopefully, we will inspire
them to continue on to higher
education," she added.

The students were selected
using criteria such as academic
potential, creativity and special
talents in more than one area,
Rosa said. They have high poten
tials. are fast learners and are
self-motivated, she added.
Guerra said he hopes these
students will serve as peer mod
els and will influence their peers
hv planning to attend college,
seeking scholarships, and ti\ i ng
to develop and achieve personal
success.
No money problems
It is too early to determine the
cost of this year's program, but
Guerra said the projected operat
ing budget is $100,000. Guerra
said no money problems are an
ticipated for next year, and said

ATO, usually a coed fraternity, is now housing 50 children of
migrant workers, here for a six week enrichment program
according to Manuel Guerra, director of the project The studen
above is playing a guitar that he, like all the other children in the
program, received as part of the $100,000 project.
I pes the program will con
ause of the transiency of
lit parents' jobs, their chil
isually lose out education-
Ill erra said.
ools are "competing with
they (youths) can earn in
elds. When a 12 or 16-

year-old can earn $70 a day in
the fields, how can school be
lucrative? How can we keep
them in school? Dropping out is
not such a bad idea if you can
help feed seven hungry
mouths," Guerra said.
The program is run by 10
bilingual teachers with
specialized skills. Guerra said he
hopes teachers will return to

their districts next fall with en
richment through direct contact
with migrant problems.
Native tongue
Most teaching is done in En
glish, although three or four stu
dents needed training in their
native tongue, Guerra said.
The program's major concern
is with what Guerra called the
"effective domain," the area of
education concerned with
moral, spiritual and humanita
rian principles. This domain is
"very important to us as we want
to reinforce and strengthen the
family concept."
Guerra said parental involve
ment is a crucial aspect of the
program, as "America's strength
is in the family.
"Parent involvement is a real
ity. Contrary to old theories, pa
rents are not competitive with
teachers in the classroom, rather
they are effective teachers'-
aides."
Students receive instruction
in art, Mexican folk dance and
intramural sports. Every
weekend they go to San Fran
cisco to the museum, theater or
symphony.
Group and private tutoring is
given to students in the "cogni
tive domain" as well. This do
main includes such disciplines
as mathematics, linguistics and
social studies.
