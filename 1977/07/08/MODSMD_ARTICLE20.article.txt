# Dealing with Brecht's Lehrstücke
## Robert Egan and John Rouse on the problems involved therein 
### John Nielsen 
The Measures Taken and The
Exception and the Rule are
one-act plays by Bertolt Brecht.
John Rouse and Robert Egan
will direct the Stanford Drama
Department's presentation o/
these plays beginning July 12 at
8 p.m. at the Nitery. Tickets will
be $1, at the door.
Recently Rouse and Egan
spoke with the Daily about the
dynamic? o/ Rrecht's
Lehrstucke. What follows is an
edited version of their com
ments.

We don't want to say "OK you swine, now
we're going to tell you the truth." If we do that,
the audience is not likely to respond by re
thinking.

Daily: What is a Lehrstuck?
Rouse: In essence, Lehrstuck
means learning play . . . Brecht's
method by which people could
acquaint themselves with im
portant issues. The play presents
the participants with a situation
and the participants compare
what they see with conditions in
their own lives and social struc
tures.

For instance, in The Exception
and the Rule, the audience is
presented with the innate inhu
manity of the capitalist (pre
revolutionary) system.
Daily: Does The Measures Taken
deal with a similar subject?
Egan: Yes and no. Externally,
Measures involves a policeman,
a capitalist merchant trader and
a sort of overseer warlord who
beats his coolie as they drag rice
barges up the river. Internally,
though, my play concerns itself
with conflict within the party,
within the ideology.

Daily: Did Brecht assume that
he'd have a Marxist audience?
Egan: Yes.
Daily: Is this a problem?
Egan: It's not exactly a problem,
but it does change things. Be
cause we are likely to have an
added conflict between the
ideology of the audience and the
ideology of the play, there will
no doubt be some questioning of
things that Brecht took for
granted. The audience will ques
tion the ideological soundness
of the communist party, for in
stance, or question whether the
party actually can help those
thousands of people. Brecht
spent very little time debating
the efficacy of the Marxist or
Communist doctrine. The
people in his audience would
have assumed these things and
would have gone on to the finer
points.

Daily: How will you adjust to the
tendency of a non-Marxist audi
ence to ask non-Marxist ques
tions?
Rouse: We adjust the emphasis a
little bit, stress the means by
which the play is made accessi
ble. We don't want to be seen as
preaching. We don't want to say
"Okay, you swine, now we're
going to tell you the truth." If we
do the audience is not likely to
respond by rethinking. They are
likely to say "Oh, Geez, it's that
commie Brecht again, blowing
his horn. Big deal. Let's go
home."
Egan: The idea is to get an inter
change going between the play
and the audience and that is not
something they're used to.
American theater is the theater
of naturalism. . . .
Daily: Naturalism.
Rouse: Right. You want a quic
kie definition?
Daily: Yes.
Egan: Okay. Naturalism in
volves a plot that you can follow
from A to B. It makes use of ac

identity of the character that
they play into the foreground.
The great description is of a
fourth wall — you are in a room
and the fourth wall has been sec
retly taken out —
Rouse: And you are part of a
group of voyeurs who have paid
for the privilege of peeking into

the living room of a typical fam
ily. In this country, we are accus
tomed to having a division bet
ween the actors and the audi
ence.
Daily: The audience comes to
see a slice of life?

There is a scene, presented by three or
people. Then these people sit down,
some others get up. Putting it ail togeth
the job of the audience.

Egan: Exactly. If it is John Rouse
up there playing Stanley Kovv
alski, no one wants to see him
reminding the audience that it is
John Rouse. They want to see
Stanley Kowalski. They're try
ing to deny artifice.
Daily: Is that what Brecht re
jected?
Egan: Brecht wants you always
to be aware that there is artifice.
He wants you to think about it
and not get lost emotionally-
In this sense Brechtian
techniques are intended primar
ily as negatives, designed to stop
our insistent tendency to iden

tify with the characters and not
think about the issues of the
situation.
In Measures we don't want the
audience to identify with the
agitators. We will restrict them
to a small emotional range. The
set will be a blank square plat
form and there will be no props.
The costume will not be at all
extravagant, not specific to any
region.
The movement and language
will be very severe, austere. Ac
tors will take up positions arbit
rarily, without real, naturalistic
rationale. Some of the actors wil 1
be placed in the audience.
The actors will wear masks
from time to time. We do not
want the audience emotionally
involved with the characters but
there are other reasons. Masks
