"I hear he's on PCP," one per

shake their heads; those who
have never heard of PCP feign
dismay anyway.

A group of blond college

Helpless spectators in the

usually unable to avoid the splat.
By the time Santana appears,
nearly everyone on the grass is

standing, as more people stream
onto the playing field until there
is no room to sit.
But only Lynyrd Skynyrd is
able to whip the crowd into a
frenzy. When the group moves
into "Freebird" for its encore,
people shout, hug each other,
wave Confederate flags and
throw things in the air.
For Peter Frampton, the top
bill on the day's program, crowd
reaction is far less enthusiastic.
People start to stream out as
Frampton reappears for his first
encore. And by the time he
churns out "Fm in you," only
some die-hards on the grass are
left.
The rest of the crowd is ambl
ing about in parking lots, search
ing for door locks and ignition
switches. The sun alone would
have done them in. And most
people have taken in more than
just some sun.
