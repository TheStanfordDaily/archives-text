# 'Black & White in Color'
## Lacks punch 
### 
Catherine Peters

Within the framework of World War I and a meaningless battle in
west central Africa, Black and White in Color mocks the absurdities
of patriotism, colonialism and war.
This year's Academy Award winner for best foreign film, Jean-
Jacques Annaud's film is set in a combination French military fort
trading post near German-held territory in colonial Africa.
After receiving news of World War I, the outpost's inhabitants
attemptto imitatethefaraway struggleagainsttheGermanswho had
been friends the day before.
Although the film has been applauded for its genuine disgust with
war, it lacks the creative drive necessary for lasting impact. It has
been compared to Renoir's Grand Illusion and De Broca's King of
Hearts, two films which make serious and profound statements
about the extravagances of war and those who conduct them.
Black and White in Color raises the same issues without making
them interesting or memorable. The film delights in showing us the
absurdity of patriotism (friends today, enemies tomorrow); corrup
tion (priests who try to prove white superiority to black natives by
riding bicycles); and racism (natives chant about the stinking feet of
fat white men while an uncomprehending priest extols the sweet
ness of their singing.)
The humor is good for a momentary chuckle but the joke is soon
forgotten.
Black and White in Color is witty without being sharp; intellectual
without being thought provoking. While the issue raised by the fil ms
are important to consider, it would be more informative to see them
presented in a more creative and timeless film.
