Neutron bomb testing done
Washington — Underground testing of
the neutron bomb has been conducted in
Nevada, said a government official yes
terday.
Said one expert familiar with the U.S.
nuclear weapons testing program, "The
neutron bomb has been tested at the
Nevada test site, and probably within the
past year."
"It's a matter of procedure that
weapons are tested before production,"
said James Cannon of the Energy Re
search and Development Administration.
The neutron bomb, destined to be used
as a warhead for the Lance missile, is de
signed to kill people with massive doses
of radiation while leaving most buildings
intact.
The Pentagon is seeking funds in order
to put the bomb into production. Presi
dent Carter is expected to decide in mid-
August whether or not to go ahead with
production.
Cannon said the neutron bomb, known
as the enhanced radiation warhead, "is
under development now." He did not say
however, how often the weapon has been
tested or the results.
Cannon added that the tests have been
conducted under treaties with the Soviet
Union which require that nuclear tests be
conducted underground and that no radi
ation escape.
In Las Vegas however, ERDA official
Dave Jackson said he could neither con
firm nor deny that a neutron bomb had
been exploded this year at the Nevada
Test Site.
"All nuclear weapons tests are con
ducted underground at the Nevada Test
Site. That's where they do it," Jackson

said.
But he added that because it is clas
sified information, he is unable to com
ment on any specific test.
Chinese pilot defects
Taipei — In the first defection of its
kind in more than a decade, a squadron
commander in the Chinese air force flew
his MIGI9 jet fighter to Taiwan yesterday
and asked for political asylum.
Although his plane is outdated, and
therefore of no value to Western intelli
gence officers, the pilot, Fan Yuan-yen,
brought documents concerning Chinese
coastal military installations and other
defense information, said the Nationalist
Chinese defense ministry.
For his deed, informed sources said
that Fan would be rewarded with about
$700,000 worth of gold. The Nationalist
government offers rewards in gold to de
fectors who bring their planes or naval
vessels with them.
A defense ministry spokesman re
ported that Fan told officers in Taiwan
that life on the mainland was "so suffer
ing," he had no "choice but to flee to
Taiwan."
"There are no human rights on the
China mainland," he was quoted as say
ing.
Nationalist Chinese Premier Chiang
Ching-kuo praised Fan's defection move

as a brave act.
New postal rates proposed
Washington — Postmaster General
Benjamin Bailar formally proposed Wed
nesday a special "citizen rate" for postage
that would keep the 13 cent stamp for first
class personal letters or bill payments.
Bailar was following a suggestion made
by President Carter last Thursday. Carter
had suggested a split rate, differentiating
between individuals and businesses.
Under the new plan, first class rates for
business mail would increase to 16 cents
per ounce, postcards would rise to 10
cents, and parcel post charges would in
crease 27 per cent. Second class rates,
covering mailed newspapers and
magazines, would climb an average of 29
per cent under the plan.
The Postal Service's board of governors
should adopt the proposals next week
and then submit them to the Postal Rate
Commission. The Commission then has
10 months to act on the new rates.
To be sent for 13 cents, a letter would
have to bear a handwritten address. This
could be either the delivery or return ad
dress. In this way, the "citizen rate"
would apply to personal correspondence
within the U.S., and to households pay
ing their bills. But the handwritten re
quirement is designed to keep businesses
from trying to use the 13 cent rate instead

of the 16 cent rate.
Crime rate drops 9 per c
