# Trials may be delayed; 235 plead 'not guilty'
## 
### Bonny Rodden 
Jury trials for 235 ot the 294
South Africa protesters arrested
here in May may be postponed
for three months until Director of
Public Safety Marvin Her
rington, a key defense witness,
returns to Palo Alto. The trials
for protesters who pleaded inno
cent were scheduled to begin
July 18 and continue through
Oct.
'"We're going to argue we can't
put on a case without him."
Jeremy Fogel, one of the 20 at
torneys representing the protes
ters, said last night.
Fogel said he heard Her
rington was in \ irginia in an !■ HI
program. A public safety otticer
confirmed that Herrington is out
of the state but refused to specify
his whereabouts.
Herrington read portions ot
the Penal Code to the protesters
May 9 informing them they were
violating numerous laws by oc
cupying the Old Union alter
closing time.
Fogel said the defense attor
neys may make a motion to post
pone the trials today or wait
until July 18. They are scheduled
to argue another motion today
ordering a deposition from Her
rington. rhe deposition would
challenge his status as a peace
officer and his authority to read
the violations.
If Municipal Court Judge Ed
ward Scoyen grants the deposi
tion motion. Herrington will be
required to appear in court
under oath.
The attorneys have also filed a

motion to suppress evidence
charging the arrests were made
illegally.
21 jury trials
Scoyen assigned last Thurs
day an average of 11 defendants
to each of 21 jury trials.
However, it is expected only
three or four trials will be held
before charges are dropped or
the defendants change their in
nocent pleas to guilty.
During the court session
Thursday, attorneys entered in
nocent pleas for 235 protesters
on two trespassing charges and
one of failure to disperse.
Four protesters pleaded no
contest, equivalent to guilty, to
one trespassing charge and were
put on six months probation.
The conviction can be erased
from their records after the prob
ationary period is over. Three of
the four were fined $85 and the
fourth was given two months to
complete 40 hours ol volunteer
work instead ot the fine.
Judicial emergency
Fearing the protesters would
attempt to tie up the court by
demanding jury trials within 45
days as 184 Vietnam protesters
tried to do in 1971. Scoyen asked
the California chief justice be
fore Thursday's session to im
pose the Judicial Emergency Act

for the second time in the state's
history.
The act would permit Scoyen
to call in judges from other juris
dictions to hear cases and to hold
trials in courtrooms outside Palo
Alto.
The act was first used in H)7l
when Scoyen needed help in
hearing cases resulting from
demonstrations at Hansen
Laboratories, at Encina Hall and
on El (-amino Real.
Goal accomplished
Scoyen said Chief Justice Rose
Hird has taken the recent request
under submission but has not
granted it. He said the mere re
quest for the act has ac
complished what he wanted
anyway.
Defense lawyers agreed to
waive the rights of the deten
dants for a trial within tin'
45-day limit, enabling Scoyen to
schedule a trial per week in July
and October and two per week in
August and September.
The attorneys also agreed to
allow Scoyen to schedule trials
in Santa Clara if necessary.
The 55 demonstrators who did
not request jury trials entered
guilty or no contest pleas soon
after they were arrested. They
have been put on probation for six months and
fined $65.
Charges dropped?
Martin Eichner, one of the 20 lawyers represent-
ing the protesters, said most defendants are plead-
ing innocent in hopes the Santa Clara County Dis-
trict Attorney will drop charges instead of going
through with the trials.
D.A. Tom Fahrenholtz refused to say whether he
would eventually drop charges.
"I'm not going to guess what I plan to do in the
future," he said.
The defense lawyers have said Fahrenholtz will
probably drop charges if the defendants in the first
few trials win their cases. If the defendants lose,
many of the protesters scheduled for later court
dates may change their pleas to guilty, foregoing
trials.
Maximum sentence for a guilty conviction is 3
months in jail and/or a $500 fine.
Grant Lichtman, who pleaded no contest before
the judge and was assigned volunteer work, said
he could not plead innocent with a clear consci-
ence.
"I can't go stand up there in front of 12 decent
jury people and tell them I'm not guilty," he said.
Lichtman told the judge, "But I do want to say I
don't believe I was wrong. I do believe it is rightly
the law that is higher than the law of man.

Judicial emergency
Fearing the protesters would
attempt to tie up the court by
demanding jury trials within 45
days as 184 Vietnam protesters
tried to do in 1971. Scoyen asked
the California chief justice be
fore Thursday's session to im
pose the Judicial Emergency Act

for the second time in the state's
history.
The act would permit Scoyen
to call in judges from other juris
dictions to hear cases and to hold
trials in courtrooms outside Palo
Alto.
The act was first used in H)7l
when Scoyen needed help in
hearing cases resulting from
demonstrations at Hansen
Laboratories, at Encina Hall and
on El (-amino Real.
Goal accomplished
Scoyen said Chief Justice Rose
Hird has taken the recent request
under submission but has not
granted it. He said the mere re
quest for the act has ac
complished what he wanted
anyway.
Defense lawyers agreed to
waive the rights of the deten
dants for a trial within tin'
45-day limit, enabling Scoyen to
schedule a trial per week in July
and October and two per week in
August and September.
The attorneys also agreed to
allow Scoyen to schedule trials
in Santa Clara if necessary.
The 55 demonstrators who did
not request jury trials entered
guilty or no contest pleas soon
after they were arrested. They
have been put on probation for six months and
fined $65.
Charges dropped?
Martin Eichner, one of the 20 lawyers represent-
ing the protesters, said most defendants are plead-
ing innocent in hopes the Santa Clara County Dis-
trict Attorney will drop charges instead of going
through with the trials.
D.A. Tom Fahrenholtz refused to say whether he
would eventually drop charges.
"I'm not going to guess what I plan to do in the
future," he said.
The defense lawyers have said Fahrenholtz will
probably drop charges if the defendants in the first
few trials win their cases. If the defendants lose,
many of the protesters scheduled for later court
dates may change their pleas to guilty, foregoing
trials.
Maximum sentence for a guilty conviction is 3
months in jail and/or a $500 fine.
Grant Lichtman, who pleaded no contest before
the judge and was assigned volunteer work, said
he could not plead innocent with a clear consci-
ence.
"I can't go stand up there in front of 12 decent
jury people and tell them I'm not guilty," he said.
Lichtman told the judge, "But I do want to say I
don't believe I was wrong. I do believe it is rightly
the law that is higher than the law of man.
Jury trials for 235 ot the 294
South Africa protesters arrested
here in May may be postponed
for three months until Director of
Public Safety Marvin Her
rington, a key defense witness,
returns to Palo Alto. The trials
for protesters who pleaded inno
cent were scheduled to begin
July 18 and continue through
Oct.
'"We're going to argue we can't
put on a case without him."
Jeremy Fogel, one of the 20 at
torneys representing the protes
ters, said last night.
Fogel said he heard Her
rington was in \ irginia in an !■ HI
program. A public safety otticer
confirmed that Herrington is out
of the state but refused to specify
his whereabouts.
Herrington read portions ot
the Penal Code to the protesters
May 9 informing them they were
violating numerous laws by oc
cupying the Old Union alter
closing time.
Fogel said the defense attor
neys may make a motion to post
pone the trials today or wait
until July 18. They are scheduled
to argue another motion today
ordering a deposition from Her
rington. rhe deposition would
challenge his status as a peace
officer and his authority to read
the violations.
If Municipal Court Judge Ed
ward Scoyen grants the deposi
tion motion. Herrington will be
required to appear in court
under oath.
The attorneys have also filed a

motion to suppress evidence
charging the arrests were made
illegally.
21 jury trials
Scoyen assigned last Thurs
day an average of 11 defendants
to each of 21 jury trials.
However, it is expected only
three or four trials will be held
before charges are dropped or
the defendants change their in
nocent pleas to guilty.
During the court session
Thursday, attorneys entered in
nocent pleas for 235 protesters
on two trespassing charges and
one of failure to disperse.
Four protesters pleaded no
contest, equivalent to guilty, to
one trespassing charge and were
put on six months probation.
The conviction can be erased
from their records after the prob
ationary period is over. Three of
the four were fined $85 and the
fourth was given two months to
complete 40 hours ol volunteer
work instead ot the fine.
