# Public transport

The University's recent an
nouncement that all on-campus
parking will be subject to fee be
ginning this fall might be inter
preted as a move for energy con
servation. Similar measures at
local, state, and federal levels,
such as rising highway tolls and
fuel prices, are intended to pro
mote greater use of public trans
portation as an alternative to
driving.
Nevertheless, regardless of
how burdensome such financial
incentives become, most are de
stined to fail or enjoy only li
mited success. The reason is the
present gross inadequacy of al
ternative means of transporta
tion in America, particularly to
the commuting population.
Of primary importance is ac
cessability; many urban transit
systems simply fail to serve large
portions of their respective cities
and environs. BART, for exam
ple, designed to link all Bay Area
communities, never reached the
west bay due to the unwilling
ness of residents to finance it.
Most felt the existing Southern
Pacific rail line, along with bus
transportation, to be adequate.
Now however, SP is trying de
sperately to close its commuter
service because of recurrent fi
nancial deficits, and Greyhound
has significantly curtailed its
runs between San Francisco and
points south. Furthermore, SP's
paucity of riders is not surpris
ing in view of the inconvenience
afforded by the single disem
barkment point at the extreme
southern end of the city.
The problem of accessability
is often compounded by the lo
cation of many transit lines in
undesirable or poor security
areas. An individual is unlikely
to drive to public transportation
if it jeopardizes his life enroute
to work or his vehicle while at

work. CitiOo such as Chicago
have attempted to overcome this
problem by maintaining
guarded lots forcommuters driv
ing to mass transit systems.
However, the fee associated
with these is often incentive for
the person to continue driving
and pay to park near his
ultimate destination.
Also, time plays an important
role in the inadequacy of present
public transportation. Commut
ers may find it necessary to
transfer several times or even
utilize several different lines to
reach their destination, each in
evitably involving a separate
wait. While crawling through
rush hour traffic may not be any
faster, it is more attractive to
many commuters due to privacy,
the company of a radio, and the
privilege of a guaranteed seat.
Finally, the fact that mass
transit has not remained im
mune to inflation tends to limit
its utilization. Many commuters
find it more economical to drive
to work than to pay daily fares or
public lines. Discounts to regu
lar users are uncommon, and the
requirement of exact change on
many lines (intended to deter
robbery of operators) is often a
nuisance to riders.
It should be evident that ef
forts to discourage driving will
not succeed until realistically
acceptable alternatives are made
available. Improvement of exist
ing public transportation and
planning of new systems must
be done from the commuter's
perspective. Until convenience,
safety, and economy become in
tegral parts of mass transit, en
couragement of car pool forma
tion seems a more fruitful ap
proach toward alteration of cur
rent "wasteful" travel habits.
