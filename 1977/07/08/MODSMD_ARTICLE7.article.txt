# Parents and child abuse

(This is the first of a two-part series.)
At least a million children will be criminally
abused by their parents this year. Many will be
emotionally traumatized. Many will bear perma
nent physical scars. Some will die.
Child abuse occurs in the wealthiest homes and
in the poorest. Like rape, incest and spouse batter
ing, child abuse is a truly democratic social crime.
No group escapes it. Every group perpetrates it.
Each child is a potential victim. Each parent is a
potential abuser. The calm parent of today may
become the violent parent of tomorrow. The sweet
cherub of this morning may become the stil 1 corpse
of tonight.
Why.' 1 The question is asked unceasingly, and
some answers have come to light.
Current wisdom identifies crisis situations and
emotional stress as the chief causes of child abuse.
Parents acting under extreme tension and aggrava
tion may lose their patience and, momentarily,
their sanity. They may strike out unintentionally,
damage unknowingly, kill or mutiliate without
meaning to.
Stress produces anger. Anger produces vio
lence. Violence directed against children is child
abuse.
Another contributing factor to child abuse is
held to be parental ignorance of the needs and
developmental stages of their children.
At so many weeks, infant crying may seem un
bearable. At so many months, infant demands may
seem intolerable. At so many years, infant dis
obedience may seem insurmountable.
If only parents were educated about these child
hood "stages," the thinking goes, they could better
deal with their own reactions to them.
Education, then, is seen as an important tool in
solving the ever-increasing problem of child
abuse. Talklines are established in hopes that pa
rents will pick up the phone instead of a weapon.
Abusive parent seminars are held to help guilty
parents see that they are not alone.
And, as far as these approaches go, they are
admirable and effective. But they do not go far
enough. Stress does not exist in a vacuum. Parental
stress, as it occurs in today's home, is often a direct
result of the nuclear structure of that home.
Consider the following situation:
You alone, or perhaps with one other adult, have
the sole responsibility of raising, say, two chil-

dren. Your job is to guide them into becomin
reasonable facsimiles of yourself.
You must teach them habits of eating an c
liness. You must teach them proper socia
havior. You must give them love and nurture,
must protect them from physical and emoio
harm, keep them well-clothed, teach them sou
values and settle their disputes.
And they are not cooperating. ir Thpvdi
