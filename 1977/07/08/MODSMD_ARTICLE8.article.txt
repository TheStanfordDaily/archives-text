Houck dies
Dr. George Houck, emeritus
professor of medicine, died
Tuesday in Palo Alto of a heart
attack. He was 75.
Houck came here in 1946 to
help establish a student health
service with Dr. John Eckert,
now a retired local physician.
The service made Palo Alto
Clinic physicians available to
students here on a contract basis.
Houck retired in 1967. He is
survived by his widow and two
children. No funeral services are
planned.
