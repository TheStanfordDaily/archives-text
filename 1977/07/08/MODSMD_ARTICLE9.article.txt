# Law prof Sher new P.A. mayor

Law Prof. Byron Sher, recently elected mayor of
Palo Alto, said restructuring the city's zoning laws
will be tops among the duties he faces.
Sher was chosen mayor by the Palo Alto City
Council on its fourth round of balloting Tuesday
night. He previously served as mayor in 1974-75.
Sher said the zoing laws need to be reformulated
to be in line with the city's comprehensive plan,
adopted this spring.
Other goals he identified include searching for
alternative sources of energy, monitoring and pos
sibly revising the town's water rationing plan and
adopting a master plan for Palo Alto's baylands.
In the past year, council efforts to regulate or
close down massage parlors, pinball arcades and
card rooms have drawn considerable attention.
Sher said he hoped "much of that is behind us."
Sher's principal opponent for the four ballots
was Councilman Scott Carey, identified with the
council's more conservative faction. Sher said,
however, that he expects less of a split in this year's
council than in years past.
The mayor's role, Sher said, is "to facilitate the
running of meetings. He takes a less active role in
terms of debate or making motions."
"It's important that the mayor be impartial," he
added.
Sher's term will be until July 1978.
