# Watson wins golf tourney
## 
### 
When Bud Finger, Card golf
coach in 1970, said Tom Watson,
his No. 1 golfer, was "the best in
the world, everyone thought I
was crazy," Finger recalled.
But Finger's prediction is
looking mighty good this year,
with Watson emerging as the
leading money winner on the
Professional Golfer's Associa
tion tour this year.
Watson added to his honors
this weekend by capturing the
British Open, finishing one
stroke ahead of Jack Nicklaus.
"Tom sacrificed a lot to get
where he is," Finger recalled.
"He used to go out on the prac
tice tee at noon, and hit balls
until dinner time. There aren't
many guys who put in that kind
of time."
Watson has continued his ties
to Stanford golf, sponsoring a
Pro-Am tournament in Sep
tember for several years. Finger
said another Watson Pro-Am
will be held Sept. 26, with 21
touring pros playing along with
alumni and "friends of Stanford
golf."
In past years, the Pro-Am has
earned over $20,000, which is
used to support the golf program
here.
Watson, Class of 1970, was a
psychology major.
Finger retired as men's golf
coach this spring.
