# Parents applaud loan program
## 
### George Anders 
Parents have given the Uni
versity's new Parent Loan Prog
ram an "outright enthusiastic"
reception, according to Harry
Turner, associate director of fi
nance.
The program, approved by the
Board of Trustees in February,
lends University money to mid
dleincome parents ofstudents to
help parents meet the costs of
sending their children here. The
program begins with the Class of
1981 and charges 8% per cent
interest annually.
"A lot of parents have gone out
of their way to say good words
about the program," Turner said.
He noted that a comparable bank
loan would entail interest pay
ments of at least 12 per cent a
year.
"There's no way you can get
even a comparable rate from any
commercial institution," he
said.
When Stanford adopted the
program, it and Harvard were
the only schools with such an
option. Now, Turner said,
numerous other schools are con
sidering adopting their own pa
rent loan programs.
These others include the Uni
versity of Southern California,
Pomona College and Mills Col
lege, he said.
About 100 parents of members
of the Class of 1981 have already
taken out these loans, Turner

said. This number isaboutw
was expected, he added.
Turner predicted that betw
100 and 150 loans would be
sued this year, saying
probably be "a surge of actii
around Registration Day."
The average loan is for ab
$4000 each year, or 516,0000
four years. Turner said. As
stantial number of parents h
taken out loans for $6000,
maximum amount possible,
said.
Parents are guaranteed to
ceive the loan for tour years,
said. Repayments, as appro!
by the trustees, begin they
after the loan is issued, and
spread out over six to eij
years.
When the trustees appro!
the program, they left open
option to expand it to theClasi
1980 and other previous class
Such expansion is "doubtf
but not precluded, Turner sa

Only two applications
loans have been refused, Tun
said. "Both looked very qu
tionable," he asserted.
