## Lowering rent the conference way ... 
### Jay Roach 
After spring quarter finals each year,
e mass migration away from campus
ivers enrolled student population from
'er 10,000 to under 3000. But when most
the students are gone, the buildings,
B lawns, the plants and the employes
cessary to service them remain.
Bills and payrolls must still be met.
If it were not for the thousands of pay
g guests who attend various confer
ees on campus each summer, these
;ed costs would be reflected in higher
omand board rates for the students re
rning each fall, said Lois Fariello, con
rence manager.
This summer Fariello's office is handl
g over 6000 conferees who are par
lipating in 81 different programs here,
though convenient, the catch-all label
(inferences" is not completely accurate,
some of the programs are nothing more

than athletic summer camps and cheer
leading clinics.
Financial motives
The justification for the summer col
ference program is a financial one.
"When direct and indirect costs are ac
counted for," Fariello said, "the summer
programs don't make much of a profit."
However, by keeping student residences
as near to full capacity as possible
throughout the summer, she said the con
ferences do offset overhead costs that ac
cumulate even without paying occup
ants.
"When we lose money, it shows up in
the following year's rates," she added.
Fariello pointed out that each spring,
the controller's office includes a forecast
of the coming summer's earnings in de
termining tentative room and board rates
for the following school year.
A group must first be sponsored by

some university department to be consi
dered for scheduling. Each department
uses its own criteria in deciding whether
to sponsor a program or not. The confer
ence brochure summarizes these stan
dards by saying that each conference
must be "consistent with Stanford's edu
cational purposes."
The Graduate School of Business and
the Athletic Department are frequent con
ference sponsors, as are Memorial Church
and the Stanford Alumni Association.
Negotiation
After a group obtains a sponsor, usually
early in the school year, it must negotiate
with the conference office over prices,
length of stay, food and linen services and
facility use. It is then up to Fariello to
make arrangements with the campus of
fices having jurisdiction over those
facilities.
Facility hunting, Fariello said, "is the

hardest part of the job," as she must com
pete with regular summer school classes
and other programs for building space.
Fariello admitted that church and
youth groups often pay lower rates for
food and lodging than some business
oriented groups, since "the
businessmen's expenses are often paid for
by the individual's businesses. They can
afford to pay a little more."
Similar programs
Fariello said she believes most other
universities have similar summer prog
rams
"Almost every university is in the bus
iness. We are always in competition with
other Northern California schools."
She added that many state schools run
conference programs simiiar to Stan
ford's under the auspices of "continuing
education programs."

rence manager.
This summer Fariello's office is handl
g over 6000 conferees who are par
lipating in 81 different programs here,
though convenient, the catch-all label
(inferences" is not completely accurate,
some of the programs are nothing more

than athletic summer camps and cheer
leading clinics.
Financial motives
The justification for the summer col
ference program is a financial one.
"When direct and indirect costs are ac
counted for," Fariello said, "the summer
programs don't make much of a profit."
However, by keeping student residences
as near to full capacity as possible
throughout the summer, she said the con
ferences do offset overhead costs that ac
cumulate even without paying occup
ants.
"When we lose money, it shows up in
the following year's rates," she added.
Fariello pointed out that each spring,
the controller's office includes a forecast
of the coming summer's earnings in de
termining tentative room and board rates
for the following school year.
A group must first be sponsored by

some university department to be consi
dered for scheduling. Each department
uses its own criteria in deciding whether
to sponsor a program or not. The confer
ence brochure summarizes these stan
dards by saying that each conference
must be "consistent with Stanford's edu
cational purposes."
The Graduate School of Business and
the Athletic Department are frequent con
ference sponsors, as are Memorial Church
and the Stanford Alumni Association.
Negotiation
After a group obtains a sponsor, usually
early in the school year, it must negotiate
with the conference office over prices,
length of stay, food and linen services and
facility use. It is then up to Fariello to
make arrangements with the campus of
fices having jurisdiction over those
facilities.
Facility hunting, Fariello said, "is the

hardest part of the job," as she must com
pete with regular summer school classes
and other programs for building space.
Fariello admitted that church and
youth groups often pay lower rates for
food and lodging than some business
oriented groups, since "the
businessmen's expenses are often paid for
by the individual's businesses. They can
afford to pay a little more."
Similar programs
Fariello said she believes most other
universities have similar summer prog
rams
"Almost every university is in the bus
iness. We are always in competition with
other Northern California schools."
She added that many state schools run
conference programs simiiar to Stan
ford's under the auspices of "continuing
education programs."
After spring quarter finals each year,
e mass migration away from campus
ivers enrolled student population from
'er 10,000 to under 3000. But when most
the students are gone, the buildings,
B lawns, the plants and the employes
cessary to service them remain.
Bills and payrolls must still be met.
If it were not for the thousands of pay
g guests who attend various confer
ees on campus each summer, these
;ed costs would be reflected in higher
omand board rates for the students re
rning each fall, said Lois Fariello, con
rence manager.
