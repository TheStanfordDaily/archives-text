Despite press reports to the
contrary, Stanford tennis recruit
John McEnroe told the Daily yes
terday "I'll be going to Stanford
and am looking forward to it."
A July 7 Associated Press dis
patch quoted McEnroe as saying
"1 definitely still want to turn
pro, but I'm not sure when."
McEnroe said the Associated
Press "must have misquoted
me."
Whether McEnroe should turn
pro "has never been an issue,"
his mother, Kay McEnroe, said
Sunday.
"Johnny is clearly going to
college and going to Stanford,"
she added. "Stanford is every
body in the house's first choice
for johnny. He's signed, sealed
and delivered."
John McEnroe advanced to the
semifinals of Wimbleton, losing
to Jimmy Connors, but winning
the fourth set, 6-4. At 18, McEn
roe is the youngest player ever to
have advanced so far at Wimble
ton.
Although he said he will en
roll here, McEnroe added "I
might not go the full four years."
He pointed out that Connors at

tended IJCI.A for only one year
before turning professional.
McEnroe said he has already
passed up ahout $20,000 in win
nings by remaining an amateur.
If he turned pro immediately,
McEnroe said, he would "earn
enough to make a living."
Both McEnroe and his mother
noted that Dick Gould, men's
tennis coach here, had tried to
contact him twice, but McEnroe
was out of town on both occa
sions.
Kay McEnroe said Gould is "a
terribly super fellow," but said
he had not influenced her son's
decision. John McEnroe was
ranked No. 270 in the world
among male tennis players be
fore Wimbleton and had been
the top ranked male under 18 in
the United States.
(McEnroe is from Douglaston,
New York.)
