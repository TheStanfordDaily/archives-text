# The
						man who keeps Cowell running
## 
### 
In the nine years since James
McClenahan was appointed director of
Cowell Student Health Center, he's
helped institute a contraceptive prog
ram, weathered a series ofbudget cuts,
and administered a health center that's
been asked to treat everything from
broken bones to stuffy noses.
Yesterday, McClenahan talked with
the Daily about his experiences as
Cowell director.
Daily: You've said in the past that a
lot of students come in with colds or
other minor ailments that don't really
need treatment. Do you think that's
bound to be part of any student health
service?"
McClenahan: "I guess I would say it
in maybe a different way. A lot of
people come in here who maybe we
aren't going to do much for. If they've
got a cold, we aren't going to do any
thing very specific. But that happens
in any medical practice.
"I think we serve a very important
educative function. A lot of people in
this age are going from depending
somewhat on their parents to depend
ing mostly on themselves. And in that
transitional period, you need to learn a
lot of things and one of them is about
how to take care of yourself. So that
when you've got a lump here, you're
not going to know if it's cancer, you
can't ask your mom, so some people
come in and say 'What's this lump?'
"Well, I'mbeing a bit dramatic to say
that some people need health care be
cause they don't know for sure what

they've got. And those are probably
just as important.
"If you ever get to the state where the
fact that people are coming in and ask
ing about their colds really bugs you,
then you probably shouldn't be doing
it.
"One of the problems with medical
training in the United States is we've
tended to make so many people
special ists that when they get out there
in the field and the first four people
that walk in don't have some rare exo
tic disease, but have flu, they could be
unhappy."
Daily; What sort of impact did Uni
versity cost-cutting measures like the
Budget Equilibrium Program (BEP)
have on Cowell?"
McClenahan: "Initially it was
thought to be a cut of about 20 per cent,
but it's come out to be somewhere bet
ween 15 and 17 per cent. In general,
we've come out better than we thought
we would. We don't think it's affected
the quality of our service.
"Nearly every section — the sec
retaries, the nurses, the physicians —
is down one from before. We shifted

some of the care that we used to render
from the health service to insurance.
That is, we looked around and said
'What kinds of things do most people's
health insurance cover?' That is, outpa
tient surgical and accident care."
Daily: "As far as birth control goes,
what sort of changes have you seen?
When you first came here, couldn't
only married students get contracep
tives?"
McClenahan: "Well, when I first
came here, we didn't even do that. And

the first change of having contracep
tives at the health service was to say
that we could take care of married stu
dents or those intending to be married.
And then that evolved into just gener
ally making women's services includ
ing contraception available to what
ever students requested it.
"Adding the contraception was a.bit
more socially political, but the process
of doing it turned out to be quite an
easy transition. Most of the feedback
we got was not negative, but in a sense
positive. So I think that transition
came more easily than we thought.
And we got support from places like
the Mother's Club who endorsed the
book we put out."
Daily: "Has Cowell been in the van
guard as far as contraception goes
compared to other schools?"
McClenahan: "One hates to say 'in
the vanguard.' We have enough per
sonnel to provide care. One of the
problems that some health services
have in doing gynecological are is that
they don't have enough help. And it's a
fairly well used service, once you have
it.
"Two, because it was initially
somewhat of a sensitive area, we had
the support in that they (adminis
trators) said yes, go ahead and do it.
We didn't advertise or put out a big
sign, we just started doing it. But if
there was any kind of difficulty with it,
they (administrators) were suDDortive.
I guess if you took the whole coun
try and looked at all the health ser
vices, that most of them still don't pro
vide gynecological for women. And
for many years, even a place like Ber
keley didn't. Yes, you could say that
we did it earlier on. But there wasn't
any great cause, it just seemed like the
appropriate thing to do."
Daily: "Does Cowell offer more
comprehensive service in other areas
like counseling as well?"
McClenahan: "In general, again not.
If you look at the larger universities,
they tend to have a range of health care
services similar to ours. If you take
some of the medium and smaller
schools, they definitely don't. Given

the spectrum, we have one of the most
complete services in the country.
"The fact of saying we have a big
service doesn't mean that the students
who come here need more psychologi
cal help than others, or that they're
crazier. We go at it exactly the other
way around. We say 'This is a very
important group of young people here,
and are worth investing in.'
"Our counselor staff probably
spends about half their time working
in the general area of student life, you
know, getting along in the dorm, boy
and-girl relations, how to break away
from your parents, all those kinds of
things. That's one place where we
have an advantage, to be able to do
that where many schools just don't
have the personnel."
Daily: "This fall, there was an un
usually large number of counseling
sessions. Was that just a statistical
fluke, or do you see any kind of a
trend?"
McClenahan: "When we get more
people here, 1 never know exactly what
it means. Does it mean we're getting
moreapproachable, orare more people
out there upset about something? 1
would suspect it could have been some
of both.
"One of the groups you would tend
to see more of, proportionately, is
graduate students and seniors, with
what we call 'exit anxiety.' People
worry about 'Where am I going?" What
am I going to do?' "
Daily: "How difficult is it to get good
doctors to come and work for Cowell?
Is there much of a problem with lower
salaries?"
McClenahan: "That is, in general, a
problem for some health services.
We're very lucky, for many reasons.
One, it's Stanford. Two, it's Palo Alto.
We have a medical school on campus.
We live in a sophisticated medical
community, so that — no, we don't
have much trouble getting people.
There's a certain group of qualified
people who like to work with younger
people, rather than with older patients
and all these other things are a fringe
benefit.

That isn t always the case. If you're
in a small community it's sometimes
more difficult to attract physicians,
period. And our salaries have been
comparable to medical school salaries.
"We don't ever want to get in the
position that because of the salaries,
we can't get anybody that's good. If
you look at health services across the
country, again, we like to stay in the
upper half.
Daily: "How much longer do you
think you'll be director ofCowell? Do

you have anything planned afte
this?"
McClenahan: "Not specifically,
guess I like the setting too. I personall
have been able to find enough variet
in being included with some othe
things in the University that I'vefoun
it attractive. I've been on the Medici
School Admissions Committee, th
