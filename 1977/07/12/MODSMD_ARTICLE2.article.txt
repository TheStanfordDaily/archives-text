The defense argued Friday
that Herrington should be re
quired to testify to determine
whether he is legally a sheriff s
deputy and qualified to order the
arrests.
The second motion is under
submission, Scoyen said.
In person
Should Scoyen grant the de
position motion, Herrington
would be required to testify
under oath in a pre-trial exami
nation, forcing the trials to be
postponed. Herrington is par
ticipating in a three-month prog
ram at the FBI in Virginia,
Scoyen confirmed.
Defense attorney Jeremy I* ogel
said last week the defense plan
ned to ask the judge to postpone

the trials until Herrington re
turned. The police chief is a key
witness because ne ordered the
arrests.
Scoyen said yesterday no mo
tions to postpone the trials have
been submitted. Defense attor
ney Ron Romines said he ex
pects the trials to begin as
scheduled July 18.
Officers questioned
At yesterday's day-long hear
ing, three defense attorneys
questioned the police officers
who arrested protesters occupy
ing the Old Union lobby after
hours May 9.
The attorneys have said the ar
rests were made illegally be
cause the arresting officers were
not present when Herrington

read the Penal Code violations to
the protesters and ordered them
to leave the building. Police
cannot make an arrest without an
arrest warrant unless they wit
ness the crime.
The protesters are charged
with two counts of trespassing
and one of failure to disperse. All
of the charges are misdis
meanors.
Of the three arresting officers
who testified, only Nick Brunot
said he saw the charges being
read to the protesters. Philip
Love and Howard Ashcraft said
they were told the charges had
been read.
Basis for arrest
