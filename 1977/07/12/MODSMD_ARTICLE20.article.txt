# 'Private Lives'/A/ Peterson
## Coward comedy's dynamite 
### 
Modern British high comedy
which transcends the everyday
by intellect-stirring witticisms is
aptly illustrated by Noel Cow
ard's Private Lives. Berkeley Re
pertory Theatre's rendition de
monstrates the genre's strength
beyond doubt.
But that does not mean diving
into metaphysical depths. On
the contrary, Elyot Chase pleads,
"Let's be superficial and pity the
poor philosophers."
Elyot's quick, irreverant wit
distances the audience from the
romantic dilemma of lovers who
can live neither together nor
apart. Instead of being romantic,

their quandry becomes a fencing
event of razor sharp tongues
complete with barbs.
With the influence of Oscar
Wilde evident in the script and
George Kovach's directing, Pri
vate Lives, pushes the depres
sion and other woes of the 1930s
into oblivion and allows total
concentration on the subject at
hand.
The first act, one of the
strongest in modern comedy, is a
study in symmetry. Elyot and
Amanda, five years after their
divorce, each remarry and dis
cover themselves honeymoon
ing at the same French resort.

Their new partners are
stereotypic dolts. Elyot marries
Sybil, a dizzy flirt. The frail,
squeaky voiced women badgers
Elyot about Amanda. Victor,
Amanda's husband, fights to
maintain a stiff upper lip as he
pesters his wife about Elyot.
The set, which could be split
into identical halves enhances
the symmetry. However, it fails
to project the plush, French re
sorts that attracted the upper
middle class Britons. The
foliage, which appear to be
houseplants borrowed from
somebody's kitchen, are sparse
and distractingly out of place.
A beautiful, stylistically accu
rate art deco apartment set is
used for the last two acts.
Throughout the play, the cos
tumes and period music are ex
cellent.
The second and third acts hold
Coward's motif of the futility of
true and everlasting love. Elyot
and Amanda desert their
partners and reunite. Despite

their strong emotional desire to
stay together, they are soon
wolves at each other's throats.
Elyot's bid for light hearted
ness dominates. Flippancy
reigns. Paul Laramore's Elyot
remains charming despite his
sharp, insolent wit. Amanda,
played by Anne Swift, is brash
and lusty yet invokes pity•
The dolts are well played. Vic
tor (Doug Johnson) and Sybil
(Linda Lee Johnson) are socially
inept but maintain sharp wits.
Kendell Jackson, in a short ap
pearance as a French maid, is
hilarious.
Berkeley Rep's Private Lives is
an excellent production without
any major flaws. Its message,
levity as the only recourse to
life's irresolvable dilemmas, is
often recanted in the arts, and is
perhaps best stated by novelist
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
"Maturity," he said, is a dis
appointment for which no re
medy exists, unless it can be said
that laughter cures anything."

cover themselves honeymoon
ing at the same French resort.

Their new partners are
stereotypic dolts. Elyot marries
Sybil, a dizzy flirt. The frail,
squeaky voiced women badgers
Elyot about Amanda. Victor,
Amanda's husband, fights to
maintain a stiff upper lip as he
pesters his wife about Elyot.
The set, which could be split
into identical halves enhances
the symmetry. However, it fails
to project the plush, French re
sorts that attracted the upper
middle class Britons. The
foliage, which appear to be
houseplants borrowed from
somebody's kitchen, are sparse
and distractingly out of place.
A beautiful, stylistically accu
rate art deco apartment set is
used for the last two acts.
Throughout the play, the cos
tumes and period music are ex
cellent.
The second and third acts hold
Coward's motif of the futility of
true and everlasting love. Elyot
and Amanda desert their
partners and reunite. Despite

their strong emotional desire to
stay together, they are soon
wolves at each other's throats.
Elyot's bid for light hearted
ness dominates. Flippancy
reigns. Paul Laramore's Elyot
remains charming despite his
sharp, insolent wit. Amanda,
played by Anne Swift, is brash
and lusty yet invokes pity•
The dolts are well played. Vic
tor (Doug Johnson) and Sybil
(Linda Lee Johnson) are socially
inept but maintain sharp wits.
Kendell Jackson, in a short ap
pearance as a French maid, is
hilarious.
Berkeley Rep's Private Lives is
an excellent production without
any major flaws. Its message,
levity as the only recourse to
life's irresolvable dilemmas, is
often recanted in the arts, and is
perhaps best stated by novelist
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
"Maturity," he said, is a dis
appointment for which no re
medy exists, unless it can be said
that laughter cures anything."
Modern British high comedy
which transcends the everyday
by intellect-stirring witticisms is
aptly illustrated by Noel Cow
ard's Private Lives. Berkeley Re
pertory Theatre's rendition de
monstrates the genre's strength
beyond doubt.
But that does not mean diving
into metaphysical depths. On
the contrary, Elyot Chase pleads,
"Let's be superficial and pity the
poor philosophers."
Elyot's quick, irreverant wit
distances the audience from the
romantic dilemma of lovers who
can live neither together nor
apart. Instead of being romantic,

their quandry becomes a fencing
event of razor sharp tongues
complete with barbs.
With the influence of Oscar
Wilde evident in the script and
George Kovach's directing, Pri
vate Lives, pushes the depres
sion and other woes of the 1930s
into oblivion and allows total
concentration on the subject at
hand.
The first act, one of the
strongest in modern comedy, is a
study in symmetry. Elyot and
Amanda, five years after their
divorce, each remarry and dis
cover themselves honeymoon
ing at the same French resort.
