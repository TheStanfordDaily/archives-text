# Stepping out and up
## Modern, primitive numbers best for Harlem troupe 
### Jamte Monson 
The Dance Theatre of Harlem
recently completed a two-week
engagement at ACT's Geary
Theatre. One of the country's
leading ballet troupes, the com
pany has been a dynamic force in
the dance world as well as in the
growing sphere of black per
forming arts. The nation's first
permanently established black
ballet company, The Dance
Theatre of Harlem has disproven
the myth that black dancers are
incaDable of classical dance, and
has combined classical,
technique with an innovative
repertory of modern and primi
tive works.
The company showed the di
versity of its repertoire. The four
pieces they performed included
classical ballet in "Fete Noire,"
modern dance in Talley Beatty's
"Caravanserai" and Arthur
Mitchell's "Manifestations" and
primitive ritual in Geoffrey Hol
der's "Dougla."
It was made clear, through this

varied program, that the Dance
Theatre's true strength and abil
ity lie in its modern and primi
tive works — a strength that is
lacking in its classical interpre
tation. In "Fete Noire," Mitch
ell's traditional piece, the foot
work was clumsy, the leaps and
lifts were awkward and the gen
eral atmosphere was mediocre as
the dancers went through the
motions of the classical choreog
raphy. It seemed more of a con
centrated exercise rather than an
artistic expression, hardly living
up to the magnificence of the ac
companying Shostakovitch
score.
"Caravanserai," in dynamic
contrast with "Fete Noire," has a
compelling vitality that dispels
any doubts about the company's
capabilities. It begins with the
emergence of a group of dancers
from under a cocoonlike cover
ing. Once freed, the dancers per
form a network of awesome
leaps, extensions, powerful ba
lances and torso movement.
They pass in succession from
one side of the stage to the other,
executing stunning feats and
then disappearing into the
wings. Dancers Paul Russell and
Mel Tomlinson highlight the
piece with their strength and
flexibility. The accompanying
music, chosen from Santana,
pulses in perfect relation to the
choreography.
"Caravanserai" presents a
multiplicity of meaning: an un
veiling, a rebirth, a metamor
phosis, a revelation — all of
which are an expression of black
struggle.
The dancers perform beyond
the confines of choreography.
The movement seems so much a
part of them that it appears in
spired rather than instructed —
each movement is the perfect
combination of energy, time and
music.

"Manifestations," choreog
raphed by Arthur Mitchell, is a
dance version of the Bible's
Genesis. It begins with Adam,
alone in the universe. Eve,
danced by Susan Lovelle, sud
denly unfolds from his rib, grow
ing out of him into his partner
The startling and sinister des
cent of Mel Tomlinson, the ser
pent, poisons the scene and be
gins the seduction of Eve. Tom
linson performs a number o
snakelike acrobatics, as Adam
and Eve execute incredible lifts
and balances. The serpent suc
ceeds, predictably, in handing
Eve the apple — (to Adam's hor
ror, yet he bites it too) — and
Adam and Eve are passionately
united as the lights turn red and
the snake slithers away.
"Dougla," is a ritualistic rep
resentation of marriage cere
monies: "Where Twins meet,
where Hindu and Africantangle,
their offspring are called
Dougla." The dance is accom
panied by mesmerizing African
drumbeats. The dancers con
struct different groups of skirted,
hip swinging males and females;
Gayle Mckinney is beautifully
expressive as the Woman in
Green; and Ronald Perry is strik
ing as the bridegroom with his
precise turns.
The Dance Theatre of Harlem
showed a wealth of spirit, pride
and strength in the modern
works, allowing its abilities full
freedom, although the spirit and
consequently the technical skill
appeared to lag in traditional
choreography. They remain a
compelling and beautiful com
pany, inspiring in their perfor
mance.
Arthur Mitchell, the com
pany's founder, left the New
York City Ballet to create The
Dance Theatre of Harlem in the
summer of 1969, in a church
basement on 122 nd Street in

Harlem. That first summer, the
garage door was left open so that
young people passing hy could
hear the music and see the dan
cers rehearsing, as a form of re
cruitment.
At present, eight years later,
the company has a year-round
school with 1300 students, a re
pertory of over 30 ballets, and a
reputation among critics as "a
controlled avalanche." The av
erage age of the company mem
bers is a mere 20 years.

The Dance Theatre of Harlem
recently completed a two-week
engagement at ACT's Geary
Theatre. One of the country's
leading ballet troupes, the com
pany has been a dynamic force in
the dance world as well as in the
growing sphere of black per
forming arts. The nation's first
permanently established black
ballet company, The Dance
Theatre of Harlem has disproven
the myth that black dancers are
incaDable of classical dance, and
has combined classical,
technique with an innovative
repertory of modern and primi
tive works.
The company showed the di
versity of its repertoire. The four
pieces they performed included
classical ballet in "Fete Noire,"
modern dance in Talley Beatty's
"Caravanserai" and Arthur
Mitchell's "Manifestations" and
primitive ritual in Geoffrey Hol
der's "Dougla."
It was made clear, through this

varied program, that the Dance
Theatre's true strength and abil
ity lie in its modern and primi
tive works — a strength that is
lacking in its classical interpre
tation. In "Fete Noire," Mitch
ell's traditional piece, the foot
work was clumsy, the leaps and
lifts were awkward and the gen
eral atmosphere was mediocre as
the dancers went through the
motions of the classical choreog
raphy. It seemed more of a con
centrated exercise rather than an
artistic expression, hardly living
up to the magnificence of the ac
companying Shostakovitch
score.
"Caravanserai," in dynamic
contrast with "Fete Noire," has a
compelling vitality that dispels
any doubts about the company's
capabilities. It begins with the
emergence of a group of dancers
from under a cocoonlike cover
ing. Once freed, the dancers per
form a network of awesome
leaps, extensions, powerful ba
lances and torso movement.
They pass in succession from
one side of the stage to the other,
executing stunning feats and
then disappearing into the
wings. Dancers Paul Russell and
Mel Tomlinson highlight the
piece with their strength and
flexibility. The accompanying
music, chosen from Santana,
pulses in perfect relation to the
choreography.
"Caravanserai" presents a
multiplicity of meaning: an un
veiling, a rebirth, a metamor
phosis, a revelation — all of
which are an expression of black
struggle.
The dancers perform beyond
the confines of choreography.
The movement seems so much a
part of them that it appears in
spired rather than instructed —
each movement is the perfect
combination of energy, time and
music.

"Manifestations," choreog
raphed by Arthur Mitchell, is a
dance version of the Bible's
Genesis. It begins with Adam,
alone in the universe. Eve,
danced by Susan Lovelle, sud
denly unfolds from his rib, grow
ing out of him into his partner
The startling and sinister des
cent of Mel Tomlinson, the ser
pent, poisons the scene and be
gins the seduction of Eve. Tom
linson performs a number o
snakelike acrobatics, as Adam
and Eve execute incredible lifts
and balances. The serpent suc
ceeds, predictably, in handing
Eve the apple — (to Adam's hor
ror, yet he bites it too) — and
Adam and Eve are passionately
united as the lights turn red and
the snake slithers away.
"Dougla," is a ritualistic rep
resentation of marriage cere
monies: "Where Twins meet,
where Hindu and Africantangle,
their offspring are called
Dougla." The dance is accom
panied by mesmerizing African
drumbeats. The dancers con
struct different groups of skirted,
hip swinging males and females;
Gayle Mckinney is beautifully
expressive as the Woman in
Green; and Ronald Perry is strik
ing as the bridegroom with his
precise turns.

The Dance Theatre of Harlem
recently completed a two-week
engagement at ACT's Geary
Theatre. One of the country's
leading ballet troupes, the com
pany has been a dynamic force in
the dance world as well as in the
growing sphere of black per
forming arts. The nation's first
permanently established black
ballet company, The Dance
Theatre of Harlem has disproven
the myth that black dancers are
incaDable of classical dance, and
has combined classical,
technique with an innovative
repertory of modern and primi
tive works.
The company showed the di
versity of its repertoire. The four
pieces they performed included
classical ballet in "Fete Noire,"
modern dance in Talley Beatty's
"Caravanserai" and Arthur
Mitchell's "Manifestations" and
primitive ritual in Geoffrey Hol
der's "Dougla."
It was made clear, through this

varied program, that the Dance
Theatre's true strength and abil
ity lie in its modern and primi
tive works — a strength that is
lacking in its classical interpre
tation. In "Fete Noire," Mitch
ell's traditional piece, the foot
work was clumsy, the leaps and
lifts were awkward and the gen
eral atmosphere was mediocre as
the dancers went through the
motions of the classical choreog
raphy. It seemed more of a con
centrated exercise rather than an
artistic expression, hardly living
up to the magnificence of the ac
companying Shostakovitch
score.
"Caravanserai," in dynamic
contrast with "Fete Noire," has a
compelling vitality that dispels
any doubts about the company's
capabilities. It begins with the
emergence of a group of dancers
from under a cocoonlike cover
ing. Once freed, the dancers per
form a network of awesome
leaps, extensions, powerful ba
lances and torso movement.
They pass in succession from
one side of the stage to the other,
executing stunning feats and
then disappearing into the
wings. Dancers Paul Russell and
Mel Tomlinson highlight the
piece with their strength and
flexibility. The accompanying
music, chosen from Santana,
pulses in perfect relation to the
choreography.
"Caravanserai" presents a
multiplicity of meaning: an un
veiling, a rebirth, a metamor
phosis, a revelation — all of
which are an expression of black
struggle.
The dancers perform beyond
the confines of choreography.
The movement seems so much a
part of them that it appears in
spired rather than instructed —
each movement is the perfect
combination of energy, time and
