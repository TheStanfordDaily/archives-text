# Summerepertory: Theater merry-go-round
## 
### Jan Miller 
Ten units for a class that meets
seven days a week, 10 hours a
day, for 10 weeks may not seem
like a good deal for most stu
dents but that's the course load
for students in Foothill College's
unique Summerepertory com
pany.
Started after an overflow of
dramatic talent was still availa
ble at the conclusion of the
summer musical auditions at
Foothill, the Summerepertory
company began with nine per
formances of three plays. Now,
just six years later, two plays
have been added and the number
of performances has multiplied
five times.
The 55 members this summer
constitute the largest and "best
company ever" according to
executive director Doyne Mraz.
Immersed in theater daily
from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. from June
15 to September 3 with only

three weeks rehearsal prior to
their opening night, the actors
and actresses lead harried lives.
Three scheduled rehearsals
constitute 10 hours of the day
while the remaining allotments
for lunch and dinner, are cram
med with memorizing lines.
"To train people in the most
advanced kind ot theater work
that there is, repertory theater" is
Mraz's main objective in the
program. Insisting that there are
"no stars" in the company, Mraz
said, "My whole training prog
ram is based on the fact that 1
want everyone to know every
thing about theater."
Roles are distributed evenly.
Someone works lights or designs
costumes for one production
then plays the leading role in the

next. This "gets rid of that stellar
quality immediately" Mraz
explained.
Limited facilities at the cam
pus restrict the number of stu
dents Mraz can handle, and due
to a large backlog of aspiring ta
lent, Mraz no longer holds au
ditions for entrance to the sum
mer program. Instead, heaccepts
applications from interested
people while reserving priority
for past Summerepertory per
formers.
No college funds are ex
pended on the program which is
run entirely on show proceeds.
With money "always a prob
lem," the troupe has elicited
grants and sponsored fundrais
ing activities to increase their
funds. Mraz receives the only

salary.
Calling themselves Friends of
Summerepertory, a group of
friends, former Summerepertory
members and theatrical en
thusiasts have bound together in
an effort to raise money for the
company.
Sellout crowds the past four
seasons in the theater which
seats 106 are the reason "Mar
velous!" is the adjective Mraz
uses to describe the reception
Summerepertory has received in
the past.
The five plays for 1977, A
Thousand Clowns, A Cry of
Players, Gigi, The Cradle Song
and Present Laughter are slated
for 45 performances from July 8
to September 3.

the past.
The five plays for 1977, A
Thousand Clowns, A Cry of
Players, Gigi, The Cradle Song
and Present Laughter are slated
for 45 performances from July 8
to September 3.
Ten units for a class that meets
seven days a week, 10 hours a
day, for 10 weeks may not seem
like a good deal for most stu
dents but that's the course load
for students in Foothill College's
unique Summerepertory com
pany.
Started after an overflow of
dramatic talent was still availa
ble at the conclusion of the
summer musical auditions at
Foothill, the Summerepertory
company began with nine per
formances of three plays. Now,
just six years later, two plays
have been added and the number
of performances has multiplied
five times.
The 55 members this summer
constitute the largest and "best
company ever" according to
executive director Doyne Mraz.
Immersed in theater daily
from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. from June
15 to September 3 with only

three weeks rehearsal prior to
their opening night, the actors
and actresses lead harried lives.
Three scheduled rehearsals
constitute 10 hours of the day
while the remaining allotments
for lunch and dinner, are cram
med with memorizing lines.
"To train people in the most
advanced kind ot theater work
that there is, repertory theater" is
Mraz's main objective in the
program. Insisting that there are
"no stars" in the company, Mraz
said, "My whole training prog
ram is based on the fact that 1
want everyone to know every
thing about theater."
Roles are distributed evenly.
Someone works lights or designs
costumes for one production
then plays the leading role in the

next. This "gets rid of that stellar
quality immediately" Mraz
explained.
Limited facilities at the cam
pus restrict the number of stu
dents Mraz can handle, and due
to a large backlog of aspiring ta
lent, Mraz no longer holds au
ditions for entrance to the sum
mer program. Instead, heaccepts
applications from interested
people while reserving priority
for past Summerepertory per
formers.
No college funds are ex
pended on the program which is
run entirely on show proceeds.
With money "always a prob
lem," the troupe has elicited
grants and sponsored fundrais
ing activities to increase their
funds. Mraz receives the only

salary.
Calling themselves Friends of
Summerepertory, a group of
friends, former Summerepertory
members and theatrical en
thusiasts have bound together in
an effort to raise money for the
company.
Sellout crowds the past four
seasons in the theater which
seats 106 are the reason "Mar
velous!" is the adjective Mraz
uses to describe the reception
Summerepertory has received in
the past.
