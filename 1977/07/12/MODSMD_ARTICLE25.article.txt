# 'Fire Sale'/A/ Peterson
## Five alarm disaster 
### 
By combining a basic Walt Disney plot with
greedy capitalists and ethnic slurs, Fire Sale
has struck a low among contemporary Ameri
can comedy films.
This attempted satire of the Jewish
bourgeoise backfires. The simple plot relies
upon a crooked Jewish businessman (Vincent
Gardenia) and his idiot sons. The sons are try
ing to prove their manhood; one (Rob Reiner) by
saving his father's faltering business and the
other (Alan Arkin), by coaching his high school
basketball team to victory in the "big game."
The mindless plot becomes a rack for display
ing countless worn-out Jew jokes and gags. The
little characterization that is accomplished is
forsaken for the trashy gags. Like Alan Arkin's
use of a hair dryer to warm a toilet seat. It does
not matter who the characters are as long as they
are "schmucks."
And, sure, some of the gags are funny. Sid
Caesar, as a nutty uncle still fighting World War
11, is very laughable in spots.
Jewish humor is perhaps the most noble
genre of American humor but producer Marvin

Worth and screenwriter Bob klane take it out of
its usual context and reduce it to insensitive
hackings. To use such a weak plot to promote
thesegags is an insult toany intelligent viewer.
Blacks are victims of the cheapshots, too. The
basketball coach finds his miracle player, a 6'B"
black slam-dunking on a ghetto court. When
asked if he'll play in the big game, the
ballplayer agrees to play if the coach gives him
$3000 for a hot Cadillac convertible.
And the sexists are appeased. The women,
including a stereotypic Jewish mother (Kay
Medford), are portrayed as being too wacky to
know what is going on. As the movie ends, it
appears that everything will be happy ever after
as the sons, besides winning the big game and
saving the store, have impregnated their wives.
Alan Arkin's directing is disgusting and his
acting is easily his worst performance yet. Rob
Reiner is lost without Archie Bunker cutting
him down. With the exception of Sid Caesar,
the rest of the cast is mediocre at best.
If you fail to heed this review as a warning, be
prepared to stand in line to get your ticket re
funded. I did.
