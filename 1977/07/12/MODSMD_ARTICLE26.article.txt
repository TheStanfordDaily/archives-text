# New York, New York'/John Nielsen
## Beautiful pieces don't fit together 
### 
Ostensibly, it is a celebration of The Vic
tory Over Japan, with confetti and a cast of
thousands. But not quite. Beneath the hilar
ity the tone is dissonance, tension, expecta
tion. Fights break out. The dance floor re
sembles a mob interpretation of Waiting for
Godot. In short, something is wrong here,
something that even the Tommy Dorsey-like
band is unable to dispel.
Enter Robert DeNiro, libidinous G.I.
Funny at first, his mood rapidly becomes
insistent, unsettling. After sound thwartings
at the hands of taken women ("Excuse me,
do I know you from somewhere?" . . . "No.")
DeNiro sees Liza Minnelli, unescorted but
reticent WAC. He makes up his mind and
sets about his business.
What follows sets the pattern for the rest of
the movie. DeNiro inquires, she dissents.
DeNiro, insistent, becomes progressively
more threatening. The movie follows suit.
He gets ugly and the movie gets ugly. Min
nelli gets abused.
Not what's expected
New York, New York is not what I'd ex
pected. I'd expected something simpler, in
which the happy-go-lucky tenor

saxophonist dances up and down the stair
case whilst the golden-throated singer pays
homage to a glorious golden age. Busby Ber
keley, and all that.
I was wrong. Director Martin Scorses,
whose previous pictures include Mean
Streets and Taxi Driver, has always made
personal, painful films, in which the charac
ters pay anything but homage. Apparently
he didn't want this one to be any different.
It is different, though, and not because the
participants wear zoot suits and play in
struments. In Taxi Driver and Mean Streets,
the relationship between the actor and the
environment had been a complex, fluid
thing, always give and take, never contrived
or artificial. Because of this, they were hyp
notic movies, overwhelming.
New York, New York is not like that. In
New York, New York the atmosphere seems
bastardized. Everything seems twisted to fit
the aforementioned intimate ends. It doesn't
work.
But that's too harsh. "Twisted" does injus

tice to everything but the script. The script is
tlimsy and repetitive, and it buckles under
the strength of the acting. "Twisted" under
states the complexity of the music (thrilling,
sour, vindictive, depending on the
DeNiro-Minnelli mood) and ignores the oc
casional genius in staging (stylized, dream
like, purposefully shot in Hollywood
backlots). Still, while the elements are strik
ing, the overall effect is missing, but the
combination seems contrived.
Fine acting
That's too bad. New York, New York has
the finest acting of any film this year. DeNiro
plays an obsessive brooding bastard with a
saxophone to match. His performance is un
nerving. Besides being technically perfect
(the fingerings on his solos are just as they
are rumored to be) the man seems driven
from within, slightly out of control, unable
to sublimate his aggression.
Liza Minnelli has never been better. As
everyone expects, she sings us into a stupor
and raises the ghost of her mother, but she
also counters DeNiro's brilliance with a
broader, cleaner (but no less emotive) ap
proach.

the aforementioned intimate ends. It doesn't
work.
But that's too harsh. "Twisted" does injus

tice to everything but the script. The script is
tlimsy and repetitive, and it buckles under
the strength of the acting. "Twisted" under
states the complexity of the music (thrilling,
sour, vindictive, depending on the
DeNiro-Minnelli mood) and ignores the oc
casional genius in staging (stylized, dream
like, purposefully shot in Hollywood
backlots). Still, while the elements are strik
ing, the overall effect is missing, but the
combination seems contrived.
Fine acting
That's too bad. New York, New York has
the finest acting of any film this year. DeNiro
plays an obsessive brooding bastard with a
saxophone to match. His performance is un
nerving. Besides being technically perfect
(the fingerings on his solos are just as they
are rumored to be) the man seems driven
from within, slightly out of control, unable
to sublimate his aggression.
Liza Minnelli has never been better. As
everyone expects, she sings us into a stupor
and raises the ghost of her mother, but she
also counters DeNiro's brilliance with a
broader, cleaner (but no less emotive) ap
proach.
Ostensibly, it is a celebration of The Vic
tory Over Japan, with confetti and a cast of
thousands. But not quite. Beneath the hilar
ity the tone is dissonance, tension, expecta
tion. Fights break out. The dance floor re
sembles a mob interpretation of Waiting for
Godot. In short, something is wrong here,
something that even the Tommy Dorsey-like
band is unable to dispel.
Enter Robert DeNiro, libidinous G.I.
Funny at first, his mood rapidly becomes
insistent, unsettling. After sound thwartings
at the hands of taken women ("Excuse me,
do I know you from somewhere?" . . . "No.")
DeNiro sees Liza Minnelli, unescorted but
reticent WAC. He makes up his mind and
sets about his business.
What follows sets the pattern for the rest of
the movie. DeNiro inquires, she dissents.
DeNiro, insistent, becomes progressively
more threatening. The movie follows suit.
He gets ugly and the movie gets ugly. Min
nelli gets abused.
Not what's expected
New York, New York is not what I'd ex
pected. I'd expected something simpler, in
which the happy-go-lucky tenor

saxophonist dances up and down the stair
case whilst the golden-throated singer pays
homage to a glorious golden age. Busby Ber
keley, and all that.
I was wrong. Director Martin Scorses,
whose previous pictures include Mean
Streets and Taxi Driver, has always made
personal, painful films, in which the charac
ters pay anything but homage. Apparently
he didn't want this one to be any different.
It is different, though, and not because the
participants wear zoot suits and play in
struments. In Taxi Driver and Mean Streets,
the relationship between the actor and the
environment had been a complex, fluid
thing, always give and take, never contrived
or artificial. Because of this, they were hyp
notic movies, overwhelming.
New York, New York is not like that. In
New York, New York the atmosphere seems
bastardized. Everything seems twisted to fit
the aforementioned intimate ends. It doesn't
work.
