# Not enough mag
## 'Sorcerer'/Steve Reade 
### 
There are certain films about
which there is not much wrong,
but not enough right either. Sor
cerer, William Friedkin's
newest, is that kind of film. This
is obviously a work of care and
thought, and Friedkin seems to
have wanted something special
from it.
His earlier films (The French
Connection, The Exorcist) were
blockbusters; essentially action
and guts movies. Sorcerer, while
active and occasionally sus
penseful, is somehow different.
The trouble is, Friedkin does not
make it clear what the film is
meant to be, do or say.
The film's premise is that four
men, trapped by fates of their
own making in a South Ameri
can rathole and desirous of es
cape, hire out to drive two trucks
— "Lazaro" and "Sorcerer" —
full of volatile nitroglycerin and
dynamite across the mountains
to a burning oil rig.
