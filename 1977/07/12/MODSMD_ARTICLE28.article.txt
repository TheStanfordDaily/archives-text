Russ hijackers surrender
Helsinki — Two hijackers who had
taken over a Soviet airliner surrendered
yesterday after some of the hostages had
manged to escape.
The hijackers comandeered the Aerof
lot jetliner with 79 persons aboard during
a domestic flight from Petrogavodsk,
about 100 miles north of Moscow, to
Leningrad, on Sunday night. The motive
of the hijackers was not immediately
known.
The intention of the hijackers was to fly
to Stockholm, since Finland has an ag
reement with the Soviet Union for the
extradition of hijackers. However, the
plan apparently did not have enough fuel
to reach Sweden, so the pilot landed in
Helsinki, 250 miles from Stockholm.
The Finnish government carried on in
tensive negotiations most of the night,
and took a tough stand, demanding the
surrender of the hijackers, and the release
of all prisoners.
The hijackers had earlier released 40
women and children, but kept 30 hos
tages aboard the plane. They then
threatened to blow up the plane unless it
was refueled to take them out of the coun
try.
All the hostages were released upon the
surrender of the hijackers. None were re
ported injured.
The penalty for hijacking in the Soviet
Union is the death penalty.
Kent State students protest
Kent, Ohio — The trustees of Kent State
University voted Sunday to seek an in
junction for the removal of student pro

testers camped at the site of the 1970 na
tional guard shootings.
The demonstrators are blocking the
construction of a $6 million gymnasium
annex, and ignored a school order which
was read by campus police, to leave the
site.
Protesters, who call themselves the
May Fourth Coalition, say the annex will
desecrate the hill they want preserved as a
memorial for the slain students.
In a 6 to 1 vote, the trustees directed
President Glenn Olds to go to court and
seek immediate implementation if the in
junction is granted.
He said going to court will allow the
protesters a chance to be represented in
the proceedings.
If the injunction is granted and they do
not obey it, Olds said he would try to have
campus police make any necessary ar
rests.
"We must ensure against violence at
any cost," Olds said. The protesters have
vowed nonviolent resistance to arrest.
Lead in McDonald's glasses
Washington — The Food and Drug
Administration confirmed Sunday that
the cartoons painted on the outside of
McDonald's glasses contained lead.
But the FDA stopped short of issuing a
formal health warning or recall order.

John Walden, the agency's assistant
commissioner for public affairs, said
there was "no indication of an acute
health hazard."
He also stated that further tests will be
conducted "because we have to find out
whether there's a possibility that the lead
can find its way into the interior of the
glasses and thus contaminate food."
McDonald's Corp. has suspended na
tional promotion and distribution of the
glasses, but its franchises have not been
forbidden to use those already on hand.
On Friday, the Massachusetts Health
Department announced that tests taken
by an EPA chemist showed the painted
cartoons' lead content to be 18 times the
level allowed.by the state. McDonald's
disputed the accuracy of these initial
tests.
However, Edward Schmitt,
McDonald's president, said he was
pleased that the FDA will conduct more
tests in order to eliminate any doubt about
safety.

Russ hijackers surrender
Helsinki — Two hijackers who had
taken over a Soviet airliner surrendered
yesterday after some of the hostages had
manged to escape.
The hijackers comandeered the Aerof
lot jetliner with 79 persons aboard during
a domestic flight from Petrogavodsk,
about 100 miles north of Moscow, to
Leningrad, on Sunday night. The motive
of the hijackers was not immediately
known.
The intention of the hijackers was to fly
to Stockholm, since Finland has an ag
reement with the Soviet Union for the
extradition of hijackers. However, the
plan apparently did not have enough fuel
to reach Sweden, so the pilot landed in
Helsinki, 250 miles from Stockholm.
The Finnish government carried on in
tensive negotiations most of the night,
and took a tough stand, demanding the
surrender of the hijackers, and the release
of all prisoners.
The hijackers had earlier released 40
women and children, but kept 30 hos
tages aboard the plane. They then
threatened to blow up the plane unless it
was refueled to take them out of the coun
try.
All the hostages were released upon the
surrender of the hijackers. None were re
ported injured.
The penalty for hijacking in the Soviet
Union is the death penalty.
Kent State students protest
Kent, Ohio — The trustees of Kent State
University voted Sunday to seek an in
junction for the removal of student pro

testers camped at the site of the 1970 na
tional guard shootings.
The demonstrators are blocking the
construction of a $6 million gymnasium
annex, and ignored a school order which
was read by campus police, to leave the
site.
Protesters, who call themselves the
May Fourth Coalition, say the annex will
desecrate the hill they want preserved as a
memorial for the slain students.
In a 6 to 1 vote, the trustees directed
President Glenn Olds to go to court and
seek immediate implementation if the in
junction is granted.
He said going to court will allow the
protesters a chance to be represented in
the proceedings.
If the injunction is granted and they do
not obey it, Olds said he would try to have
campus police make any necessary ar
rests.
"We must ensure against violence at
any cost," Olds said. The protesters have
vowed nonviolent resistance to arrest.
Lead in McDonald's glasses
Washington — The Food and Drug
Administration confirmed Sunday that
the cartoons painted on the outside of
McDonald's glasses contained lead.
But the FDA stopped short of issuing a
formal health warning or recall order.

John Walden, the agency's assistant
commissioner for public affairs, said
there was "no indication of an acute
health hazard."
He also stated that further tests will be
conducted "because we have to find out
whether there's a possibility that the lead
can find its way into the interior of the
glasses and thus contaminate food."
