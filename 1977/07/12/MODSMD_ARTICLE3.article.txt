# Decision attacks hospital bylaws
## 
### Karen Wada 
Stanford Hospital's bylaws are
"procedurally unfair" because
they do not provide an unsuc
cessful medical staff applicant
"any semblance of a hearing on
his petition," a Santa Clara
County court preliminary deci
sion said Friday.
Superior Court Judge}. Barton
Phelps filed thememorandum of
intended decision which or
dered the University to admit
radiologist Dr. William Hayden
to its staff.
Phelps' decision said the
"contentions of the parties
(Hayden and Stanford) bring to
the surface ... a controversy
long simmering in silence bet
ween those physicians who wish
touseavailablebeds forteaching
purposes only and those physi
cians who wish to use available
beds for the treatment of com
munity patients who are not
teaching subjects."
Privileges required
Phelps said Hayden contends
that community physicians who
meet commonly accepted stan
dards of character and profes
sional competance must be
granted staff privileges.
Stanford contends it is
"primarily a teaching hospital."
he said, and has the right to close
its staff to exclude community
physicians.
"While the truth lies some
where between the extreme posi

tions taken by the parties,"
Phelps called the case's impor
tance obvious.
Though the judge's memo is a
preliminary opinion, it will
probably stand as the final
statement, according to Paula
Keve-Conway, one of Hayden's
attorneys.
She said the decision was
"uncharacteristically long and
detailed" because Phelps recog
nized the strong chance his
opinion would be appealed.
Phelps also realized, she said,
that his ruling offered guidelines
for "addressing problems
caused by the very real conflict
. . , between Stanford and the
community."
Keve-Conway said she could
not evaluate the impact of the
judgment since the hospital's
bylaws are under revision.
Phelps' decision said "no law
ful reason has been given by
Stanford" for denial of Hayden's
application.
Writ of mandate
Hayden applied for admission
to Stanford's active medical staff
in 1976, filing a writ ofmandate
to force the hospital to admit him
or to explain its denial.
He had been a fulltime Uni
versity faculty member and had
been on the active medical staff
from 1973 until 1975 when he
left to become director of a San
Luis Obispo hospital division.
He remained a clinical faculty
member.
Hospital officials failed to act
on Hayden's application, so the
credentials committee also re
fused to act, Phelps' decision
said.
When Hayden requested a
hearing, he was told the bylaws
did not provide such action, the
opinion said. According to
Phelps, "Stanford emasculated
any appeals procedure which
one might have derived from an
interpretation of its bylaw stat
ing that 'The Board of Directors
has the final authority' by tel
ling Dr. Hayden no appeals pro
cedure existed."
Hayden unsuccessfully asked
for appeal procedures in his
capacity as a clinical faculty
member but was denied by the
Board of Directors.
The board offered him a spe
cial hearing which Hayden re
jected, filing instead the petition
which prompted Phelpji' deci
sion.

Superior Court Judge}. Barton
Phelps filed thememorandum of
intended decision which or
dered the University to admit
radiologist Dr. William Hayden
to its staff.
Phelps' decision said the
"contentions of the parties
(Hayden and Stanford) bring to
the surface ... a controversy
long simmering in silence bet
ween those physicians who wish
touseavailablebeds forteaching
purposes only and those physi
cians who wish to use available
beds for the treatment of com
munity patients who are not
teaching subjects."
Privileges required
Phelps said Hayden contends
that community physicians who
meet commonly accepted stan
dards of character and profes
sional competance must be
granted staff privileges.
Stanford contends it is
"primarily a teaching hospital."
he said, and has the right to close
its staff to exclude community
physicians.
"While the truth lies some
where between the extreme posi

tions taken by the parties,"
Phelps called the case's impor
tance obvious.
Though the judge's memo is a
preliminary opinion, it will
probably stand as the final
statement, according to Paula
Keve-Conway, one of Hayden's
attorneys.
She said the decision was
"uncharacteristically long and
detailed" because Phelps recog
nized the strong chance his
opinion would be appealed.
Phelps also realized, she said,
that his ruling offered guidelines
for "addressing problems
caused by the very real conflict
. . , between Stanford and the
community."
Keve-Conway said she could
not evaluate the impact of the
judgment since the hospital's
bylaws are under revision.
Phelps' decision said "no law
ful reason has been given by
Stanford" for denial of Hayden's
application.
Writ of mandate
Hayden applied for admission
to Stanford's active medical staff
in 1976, filing a writ ofmandate
to force the hospital to admit him
or to explain its denial.
He had been a fulltime Uni
versity faculty member and had
been on the active medical staff
from 1973 until 1975 when he
left to become director of a San
Luis Obispo hospital division.
He remained a clinical faculty
member.
Hospital officials failed to act
on Hayden's application, so the
credentials committee also re
fused to act, Phelps' decision
said.
When Hayden requested a
hearing, he was told the bylaws
did not provide such action, the
opinion said. According to
Phelps, "Stanford emasculated
any appeals procedure which
one might have derived from an
interpretation of its bylaw stat
ing that 'The Board of Directors
has the final authority' by tel
ling Dr. Hayden no appeals pro
cedure existed."
