Men and rape
The fact that Shannon Blando
has provided such incisive
commentary on a large variety of
issues during the past year,
made the appearance of her ab
surd and wild diatribe against
males (Daily, June 28) all the
more disheartening.
Let us make clear at the outset
that rape is indeed a crime of vio
lence, for which the only accept
able reply at the moment is a
stiff, mandatory jail sentence,
and exactly the same fate is de
served by the infamous Wiscon
sin judge. 1 believe none of this
stands in doubt among intelli
gent and non-neurotic people
(and I am not unaware how
many "leaders" are excluded by
that definition).
But Blando's chief thesis is a
blatant affront to that very intel
ligence, and it is so damaging to
progress in human sensitivity
that I feel compelled to speak
out. The notion that males carry
out rapes like so many board pol
icy decisions is such nonsense
that 1 cannot understand how a
university student could give it
even the slightest credence.
The belief that "any male is a
potential rapist" carries exactly
the same currency as "any
woman is a potential Sadie Mae
Glutz" (i.e., Manson family
murderer), "any German is a po
tential Nazi," "any Russian is a
potential Stalin," etc. All that
the referenced "psychological
studies" show is the well-known
fact that the infant science of
psychology has yet to achieve a
significant understanding of
human personalities, their
characterization and measure
ment.
I have no doubt that most,
probably all, rapists evince the
disdain for women which is
characteristic of a sexist social
system, and I certainly agree that
changing that system will go far
towards eliminating the rape
problem.
But it should be quite clear
that the effect is at the subcon
scious, childhood-acquired
neurosis level, clearly not that of
a normally-reasoning adult,
even one with apparently sexist

opinions. How many million
males do you suppose
there are in this country
with such opinions who have
never raped anyone or even
thought of doing so? Or consider
Spain, where sexism is vastly
more "virulent" than here, yet 1
am unaware that the rape rate is
significantly higher there.
Whether Blando is aware of it
or not, there are quite a few
males who take equality of the
sexes to be as natural and neces
sary as life itself. I do not see how
our progress in spreading this at
titude can be helped by polemics
which proclaim, rather like a
super-puritan fire-breather, that
men are all a dirty evil lot out to
do in women every chance they
get.
