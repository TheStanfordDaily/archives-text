How much does nuclear fam
ily structure have to do with
child abuse?
Child abuse agencies see pa
rental stress as a major cause of
the problem, and try to treat in
dividuals as well as to educate
parents as a group. But this ap
proach, valuable as it is, does not
acknowledge one of the major
sources of parental stress, which
is the nuclear family structure it
self.
Contrary to "Genesis", the nuc
lear family did not spring full
blown from heaven. Prior to the
family made up of mother, father
and children, which we have to
day, there was the extended fam
ily, which consisted of several
generations living within the
same household. Each member
of the group served important
functions in keeping the family
strong and intact.
The growth of industrial
technology and world-wide im

perialism marked the end of the
extended family in the western
world. People went where they
could get work or land, and usu
ally left all relatives behind, ex
cept members of the immediate
family.
The death of the extended
family gave birth to the nuclear
family. It also marked the end of
freedom for both parents and
children.
No longer could an ailing pa
rent recuperate while other
adults took over the supervision
of the children. No longer could
an angry parent take a long walk
to calm down while the child
was cared for by an aunt or un
cle.
Today's parents have to be
non-stop parents, always ready
to dispense love, discipline and
justice. Similarly, today's chil
dren have nowhere else to turn
when a parent is busy or furious
or otherwise unavailable. To
day's parents and children are
locked into the hallowed limits
of their homes, homes which
often become battlegrounds, and
sometimes the scenes of abuse
and murder.
Yesterday's grandparent who
would watch the kids while the
mother or father went outdoors
to count to ten is today whisked
off to the nursing home as soon
as his or her age becomes un
sightly. Aunts and uncles have
their own nuclear families to
worry about. There are, con
sequently, no mediating influ
ences within the home. Parents
and children are at each other's
mercies and throats. One con
frontation leads to another, and
sometimes to violence and
death.
But the nuclear family struc
ture is today's ideal, and it is
faithfully imitated, its funda
mental character unquestioned.
More insidious than the inevita

ble stress it produces in the fam
ily, however, is the propaganda
with which it is presented as
ideal.
The "joys" of parenthood axe
highly touted, but rarely
realized. Nothing else is so lied
about except romantic love.
In neither case do the involved
parties "live happily ever after."
The husband or wife who is not
prepared to cope with the self
ishness of a spouse is even less
prepared to deal with the self
ishness of children. The roman
tic aura which dies in the mar
riage bed is only a mild precur
sor of the idyllic fantasy which
dies in the crib.
Parents are led to believe that
having children will be easy,
that nurturing will come natur
ally. This is the common myth
that parents have had neither in
struction or example to prove
false.
Having children today makes
privacy illusory, peace of mind
transitory, freedom from worry
impossible and financial sec
urity a dream. Being a parent in
the modern nuclear family de
mands the intelligence of Eins
tein, the resourcefulness of a
Norway rat, the patience of Job
and the knowledge of the Encyc
lopedia Britanica, plus an inti
mate familiarity with Eriksen,
Piaget, Ginott and Spock.
Now maybe this isn't asking
too much of one or two indi
viduals, but at least they should
know what they are up against
and what is expected of them.
They do not.

blown from heaven. Prior to the
family made up of mother, father
and children, which we have to
day, there was the extended fam
ily, which consisted of several
generations living within the
same household. Each member
of the group served important
functions in keeping the family
strong and intact.
The growth of industrial
technology and world-wide im

perialism marked the end of the
extended family in the western
world. People went where they
could get work or land, and usu
ally left all relatives behind, ex
cept members of the immediate
family.
The death of the extended
family gave birth to the nuclear
family. It also marked the end of
freedom for both parents and
children.
No longer could an ailing pa
rent recuperate while other
adults took over the supervision
of the children. No longer could
an angry parent take a long walk
to calm down while the child
was cared for by an aunt or un
cle.
Today's parents have to be
non-stop parents, always ready
to dispense love, discipline and
justice. Similarly, today's chil
dren have nowhere else to turn
when a parent is busy or furious
or otherwise unavailable. To
day's parents and children are
locked into the hallowed limits
of their homes, homes which
often become battlegrounds, and
sometimes the scenes of abuse
and murder.
Yesterday's grandparent who
would watch the kids while the
mother or father went outdoors
to count to ten is today whisked
off to the nursing home as soon
as his or her age becomes un
sightly. Aunts and uncles have
their own nuclear families to
worry about. There are, con
sequently, no mediating influ
ences within the home. Parents
and children are at each other's
mercies and throats. One con
frontation leads to another, and
sometimes to violence and
death.
But the nuclear family struc
ture is today's ideal, and it is
faithfully imitated, its funda
mental character unquestioned.
More insidious than the inevita

ble stress it produces in the fam

with which it is presented as
ideal.
The "joys" of parenthood axe
highly touted, but rarely
realized. Nothing else is so lied
about except romantic love.
In neither case do the involved
parties "live happily ever after."
The husband or wife who is not
prepared to cope with the self
ishness of a spouse is even less
prepared to deal with the self
ishness of children. The roman
tic aura which dies in the mar
riage bed is only a mild precur
sor of the idyllic fantasy which
dies in the crib.
Parents are led to believe that
having children will be easy,
that nurturing will come natur
ally. This is the common myth
that parents have had neither in
struction or example to prove
false.
Having children today makes
privacy illusory, peace of mind

The death of the extended
family gave birth to the nuclear
family. It also marked the end of
freedom for both parents and
children.
No longer could an ailing pa
rent recuperate while other
adults took over the supervision
of the children. No longer could
an angry parent take a long walk
to calm down while the child
was cared for by an aunt or un
cle.
Today's parents have to be
non-stop parents, always ready
to dispense love, discipline and
justice. Similarly, today's chil
dren have nowhere else to turn
when a parent is busy or furious
or otherwise unavailable. To
day's parents and children are
locked into the hallowed limits
of their homes, homes which
often become battlegrounds, and
sometimes the scenes of abuse
and murder.
Yesterday's grandparent who
would watch the kids while the
mother or father went outdoors
to count to ten is today whisked
off to the nursing home as soon
as his or her age becomes un
sightly. Aunts and uncles have
their own nuclear families to
worry about. There are, con
sequently, no mediating influ
ences within the home. Parents
and children are at each other's
mercies and throats. One con
frontation leads to another, and
sometimes to violence and
death.
But the nuclear family struc
ture is today's ideal, and it is
faithfully imitated, its funda
mental character unquestioned.
More insidious than the inevita

ble stress it produces in the fam
ily, however, is the propaganda
with which it is presented as
ideal.
The "joys" of parenthood axe
highly touted, but rarely
realized. Nothing else is so lied
about except romantic love.
In neither case do the involved
parties "live happily ever after."
The husband or wife who is not
prepared to cope with the self
ishness of a spouse is even less
prepared to deal with the self
ishness of children. The roman
tic aura which dies in the mar
riage bed is only a mild precur
sor of the idyllic fantasy which
dies in the crib.
Parents are led to believe that
having children will be easy,
that nurturing will come natur
ally. This is the common myth
that parents have had neither in
struction or example to prove
false.
Having children today makes
privacy illusory, peace of mind
transitory, freedom from worry
impossible and financial sec
urity a dream. Being a parent in
the modern nuclear family de
mands the intelligence of Eins
tein, the resourcefulness of a
Norway rat, the patience of Job
and the knowledge of the Encyc
lopedia Britanica, plus an inti
mate familiarity with Eriksen,
Piaget, Ginott and Spock.

How much does nuclear fam
ily structure have to do with
child abuse?
Child abuse agencies see pa
rental stress as a major cause of
the problem, and try to treat in
dividuals as well as to educate
parents as a group. But this ap
proach, valuable as it is, does not
acknowledge one of the major
sources of parental stress, which
is the nuclear family structure it
self.
Contrary to "Genesis", the nuc
lear family did not spring full
blown from heaven. Prior to the
family made up of mother, father
and children, which we have to
day, there was the extended fam
ily, which consisted of several
generations living within the
same household. Each member
of the group served important
functions in keeping the family
strong and intact.
The growth of industrial
technology and world-wide im

perialism marked the end of the
extended family in the western
world. People went where they
could get work or land, and usu
ally left all relatives behind, ex
cept members of the immediate
family.
