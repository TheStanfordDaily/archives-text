Lnthony Amsterdam told the
Francisco Commonwealth
i last Friday.
nsterdam said capital
shment is a "fancy word for
lly killing people," and
id that it is "surely the
est evil except for war that
society can intentionally
seto commit."
nsterdam, quoting French
lar Albert Camus, called
lal punishment "the most
Deditated of murders, to
th no criminal's deed, how
calculated . . . can be com
p."
Djustification that has been
meed to support capital
shment is valid, according
imsterdam. None of the
>ns, such as retribution and
fence,can "begin to sustain
Jurden of proof that right
ists upon them."

wders are horrible, but are
, one b y ,he people, in the
~s n ame, or with the

cannot stop these murders,
Mam said.
Her. every execution is

112? ctive name, and we can
'hem all," Amsterdam said.
«wo wrongs
Nerdam asserted that two
K. do no' make a right, and
P n g murderers cannot as-
Jeir victims' sufferings or
[ " e m back to life.
Nerdam also cited the ex
i ~0 s s of capital punish
' said that it is far less

expensive to keep someone at
the Hilton for the rest of his
natural life than to kill him.
Capital punishment is not the
best deterrent to murder,
Amsterdam contended, al
though he conceded that the
point is still "debatable."
The Supreme Court of the Un
ited States last year reviewed av
ailable evidence on the effec
tiveness of capital punishment
as a deterrent, and found it "in
conclusive."
Question before us
Amsterdam said the question
before us now is whether the
death penalty "deters murder
better than does life imprison
ment."
If the evidence is sufficiently
convincing, "are you willing to
accept responsibility for doing
the known evil of killing human
beings on the faith of your con
viction?" he asked.
"Deterrence is debatable,
whereas we know that persons
whom we execute are dead
beyond recall, no matter how the
debate . . . comes out," Amster
dam said.
"Capital punishment not
merely kills people; it also kills
some of thein in error; and these
are errors which we can never
correct," Amsterdam said.
Race and poverty
Amsterdam noted that the
administration of the death pen
alty in this country has been rid
den with discrimination on
grounds of race and poverty.
Our system is "fallible," "we
wrongly kill some people be
cause they are black or poor or
personally ugly or socially un
acceptable." All of this is a result
of happenstance, Amsterdam
said.
It is hard for judges and juries
to put real people to death, to
"look at someone in the eye and

say 'you die.' " Only some can
do it.
In addition, there are "hang
ing juries . . . hanging counties
. . . (and) hanging years; and
men live or die depending on
these flukes."
Identical crimes
Some murderers are executed,
while most who have committed
nearly identical crimes are im
prisoned, he said. Imprisonment
itself may serve as an effective
deterrent, although there is no
particular length of term that is
most effective, Amsterdam said.
"Imprisonment continues to
respect the value of human life,"

Amsterdam said. "The plain
message in capital punishment
is that life ceases to be sacred."
Some people cannot be deter
red by any means, Amsterdam
said, especially those with
power in society. They do not
expect to be called on their
crimes.
To exercise primitive ven
geance on these people, Amster
dam said, "means we are no bet
ter than the beasts we are kil
ling."
Regarding corporal punish
ment, Amsterdam said he finds
it ironic that the Supreme Court
feels it acceptable to kill a person

but not to beat him. Amsterdam
said he does not consider cor
poral punishment to be a viable
alternative to incarceration.
Although Amsterdam said he
does not personally favor hand
ing down life sentences without
the possibility of parole, he said
it is preferable to sentencing
someone to die. Amsterdam said
he would choose to trust the
parole system.
"The parole boards take the
political heat. (Convicted mur
derer) Charles Manson will
never get out again. . . . Deny
parole — do not deny life."

Deditated of murders, to

P n g murderers cannot as-
Jeir victims' sufferings or
[ " e m back to life.
Nerdam also cited the ex
i ~0 s s of capital punish
' said that it is far less

expensive to keep someone at
the Hilton for the rest of his
natural life than to kill him.
Capital punishment is not the
best deterrent to murder,
Amsterdam contended, al
though he conceded that the
point is still "debatable."
The Supreme Court of the Un
ited States last year reviewed av
ailable evidence on the effec
tiveness of capital punishment
as a deterrent, and found it "in
conclusive."
Question before us
Amsterdam said the question
before us now is whether the
death penalty "deters murder
better than does life imprison
ment."
If the evidence is sufficiently
convincing, "are you willing to
accept responsibility for doing
the known evil of killing human
beings on the faith of your con
viction?" he asked.
"Deterrence is debatable,
whereas we know that persons
whom we execute are dead
beyond recall, no matter how the
debate . . . comes out," Amster
dam said.
"Capital punishment not
merely kills people; it also kills
some of thein in error; and these
are errors which we can never
correct," Amsterdam said.
Race and poverty
Amsterdam noted that the
administration of the death pen
alty in this country has been rid
den with discrimination on
grounds of race and poverty.
Our system is "fallible," "we
wrongly kill some people be
cause they are black or poor or
personally ugly or socially un
acceptable." All of this is a result
of happenstance, Amsterdam
said.
It is hard for judges and juries
to put real people to death, to
"look at someone in the eye and

say 'you die.' " Only some can
do it.
In addition, there are "hang
ing juries . . . hanging counties
. . . (and) hanging years; and
men live or die depending on
these flukes."
Identical crimes
Some murderers are executed,
while most who have committed
nearly identical crimes are im
prisoned, he said. Imprisonment
itself may serve as an effective
deterrent, although there is no
particular length of term that is
most effective, Amsterdam said.
"Imprisonment continues to
respect the value of human life,"

Amsterdam said. "The plain
message in capital punishment
is that life ceases to be sacred."
Some people cannot be deter
red by any means, Amsterdam
said, especially those with
power in society. They do not
expect to be called on their
crimes.
To exercise primitive ven
geance on these people, Amster
dam said, "means we are no bet
ter than the beasts we are kil
ling."
Regarding corporal punish
ment, Amsterdam said he finds
it ironic that the Supreme Court
feels it acceptable to kill a person

but not to beat him. Amsterdam
said he does not consider cor
poral punishment to be a viable
alternative to incarceration.
Although Amsterdam said he
does not personally favor hand
ing down life sentences without
the possibility of parole, he said
it is preferable to sentencing
someone to die. Amsterdam said
he would choose to trust the
parole system.
"The parole boards take the
political heat. (Convicted mur
derer) Charles Manson will
never get out again. . . . Deny
parole — do not deny life."

d crime justifies inflicting

Lnthony Amsterdam told the
Francisco Commonwealth
i last Friday.
nsterdam said capital
shment is a "fancy word for
lly killing people," and
id that it is "surely the
est evil except for war that
society can intentionally
seto commit."
nsterdam, quoting French
lar Albert Camus, called
lal punishment "the most
Deditated of murders, to
th no criminal's deed, how
calculated . . . can be com
p."
Djustification that has been
meed to support capital
shment is valid, according
imsterdam. None of the
>ns, such as retribution and
fence,can "begin to sustain
Jurden of proof that right
ists upon them."

Mam said.

Nerdam also cited the ex
i ~0 s s of capital punish
' said that it is far less

expensive to keep someone at
the Hilton for the rest of his
natural life than to kill him.
Capital punishment is not the
best deterrent to murder,
Amsterdam contended, al
though he conceded that the
point is still "debatable."
The Supreme Court of the Un
ited States last year reviewed av
ailable evidence on the effec
tiveness of capital punishment
as a deterrent, and found it "in
conclusive."
Question before us
Amsterdam said the question
before us now is whether the
death penalty "deters murder
better than does life imprison
ment."
If the evidence is sufficiently
convincing, "are you willing to
accept responsibility for doing
the known evil of killing human
beings on the faith of your con
viction?" he asked.
"Deterrence is debatable,
whereas we know that persons
whom we execute are dead
beyond recall, no matter how the
debate . . . comes out," Amster
dam said.
"Capital punishment not
merely kills people; it also kills
some of thein in error; and these
are errors which we can never
correct," Amsterdam said.
Race and poverty
Amsterdam noted that the
administration of the death pen
alty in this country has been rid
den with discrimination on
grounds of race and poverty.
Our system is "fallible," "we
wrongly kill some people be
cause they are black or poor or
personally ugly or socially un
acceptable." All of this is a result
of happenstance, Amsterdam
said.
It is hard for judges and juries
to put real people to death, to
"look at someone in the eye and

say 'you die.' " Only some can
do it.
In addition, there are "hang
ing juries . . . hanging counties
. . . (and) hanging years; and
men live or die depending on
these flukes."
Identical crimes
Some murderers are executed,
while most who have committed
nearly identical crimes are im
prisoned, he said. Imprisonment
itself may serve as an effective
deterrent, although there is no
particular length of term that is
most effective, Amsterdam said.
"Imprisonment continues to
respect the value of human life,"

Amsterdam said. "The plain
message in capital punishment
is that life ceases to be sacred."
Some people cannot be deter
red by any means, Amsterdam
said, especially those with
power in society. They do not
expect to be called on their
crimes.
To exercise primitive ven
geance on these people, Amster
dam said, "means we are no bet
ter than the beasts we are kil
ling."
Regarding corporal punish
ment, Amsterdam said he finds
it ironic that the Supreme Court
feels it acceptable to kill a person

but not to beat him. Amsterdam
said he does not consider cor
poral punishment to be a viable
alternative to incarceration.
Although Amsterdam said he
does not personally favor hand
ing down life sentences without
the possibility of parole, he said
it is preferable to sentencing
someone to die. Amsterdam said
he would choose to trust the
parole system.
"The parole boards take the
political heat. (Convicted mur
derer) Charles Manson will
never get out again. . . . Deny
parole — do not deny life."
