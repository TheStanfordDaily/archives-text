# Nairobi head asks for student support
## 
### Wily Leber 
Gertrude Wilks. director ot the
private Nairobi Schools in East
Palo Alto, said she "would ex
pect more help from Stanford"
with the school's programs.
During the school year, stu
dents here participate in a one
to-one tutorial program coordi
nated through Memorial
Church. Students have done a
very good job in this program,
according to Wilks.
However, for a marathon two
week refurbishing campaign
starting July 16, help is needed,
Wilks said. With plans already
drawn up for the summer,
Nairobi "could use folks to just
roll up their sleeves and do some
work" â€” physical work, she ad
ded.
The predominantly black
schools (an elementary school
and a high school) have a wait
ing list of 86 students, and are
trying to develop resources to
accommodate as many students
as possible, Wilks said. Nairobi
High School is the only high
school in the community of
19,000.
Parents group
Nairobi schools were started
in 1968, according to a Nairobi
publication, by a group of pa
rents who evolved into the
Mothers for an Equl Education.
The parents had originally been
coordinating "The Sneak Out
Program," it continues, in which
black children were placed in
white homes so they could at

tend quality public schools.
Nairobi was established when
the group realized the impor
tance of educating their children
in their own community, the
publication adds.
The classes were first taught in
churches, until Nairobi moved
to its own site. The school has
recently had another opportun
ity for expansion, with the dona
tion of three new modular build
ings.
These buildings have just
been put on foundation, but
must be remodeled for clas
sroom use. Wilks said the school
is appealing to the community
for needed classroom and playg
round equipment. Especially
needed is someone to fix a water
pump at the school grounds, she
added.
Volunteer labor
The schools depend on volun
teer labor and supplies, she said
as they receive no federal or state
school funding.
Wilks said Nairobi plans to
keep one of these new modular
buildings open after school and
evenings to give the students a
place to go. The school's
parent-organization operates an
educational day care center and
bookstore.
Ms. Wilks said she sees great
potential for Stanford involve
ment and points to a complete
playground built by Stanford ar
chitectural students, which she
terms, "... a great addition to
the day care center."
