# Prof rides from D.C.
## Biking across the U.S. 
### 
When John Shvne, a professor
in the Material Sciences De
partment, pedaled into Palo Alto
on his bicycle last Friday after
noon, he was greeted by a crowd
of cheering friends and admir
ers.
Shyne, who had been in
Washington, D.C. for the past
two years working with the Na
tional Science Foundation, de
cided to make his return trip
memorable by riding his bicycle
instead of choosing a less

strenuous form of transporta
tion.
"It was something I had to
do," said Shyne. "Cross-country
riding is one of the ultimate chal
lenges for a cyclist. Once the
idea took root in my mind it was
more of an obsession than any
thing I rationally decided.
"I guess the cross-country ride
is to the cyclist what scaling
Mt. Everest is to the mountain
climber. You do it because it is
there."

Shyne is a veteran cyclist,
whose other trips include a 1971
tour of Ireland with his family
and a 600 mile circuit of Califor
nia completed last summer with
friends.
He completed his cross-coun
try trip alone, however. Begin
ning on May 19, Shyne averaged
HO miles a day, arriving at his
destination on July 8. Except for
"one deliberate day of rest" near
Tonopah, Nev. he kept a steady
pace throughout the trip, riding
from early morning until dusk
and resting at night.
Excluding California, Shyne
said Utah was the most impres
sive state on his trip because of
the "incredible geologic forma
tions" and variety of scenery
around Capitol Reefs National
Park.
Appalachia was his least favo
rite area, he said. "1 was depre
ssed by the rural slum condi
tions there and by the effects of
the coal mining operation which
tore up the roads and spread coal
dust everywhere" Shyne
explained.
