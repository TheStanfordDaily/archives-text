The price of a Southern Pacific
train ticket from Palo Alto to San
Francisco will rise 25 per cent
when a California Public
Utilities Commission ruling
goes into effect August 5.
The company also plans to
continue seeking elimination of
its commuter line between San
Jose and San Francisco because
of low ridership and a $10
million-a-year loss on the run.
The price of a one-way ticket
from Palo Alto to San Francisco
will rise from $2.05 to $2.55.
