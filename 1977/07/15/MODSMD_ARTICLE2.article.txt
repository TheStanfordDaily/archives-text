Possony said neutron bombs could be used to
replace present U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in
Western Europe. Those weapons, he said, "are too
large and too deadly. They are not adequate for the
purpose for which we would use them if we have
to."
Battlefield weapon'
A neutron bomb would be "strictly a battlefield
weapon," Possony said. He rejected the notion of
neutron bombs being used to kill the populations
The neutron bomb is needed, Possony said, to
deal with "the threatening imbalance in Western
Europe" between Western and Soviet forces
Drell expressed concern over the notion hat na
