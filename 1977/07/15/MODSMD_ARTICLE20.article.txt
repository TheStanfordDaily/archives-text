# 'A Chorus Line'
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
Waiting. In tights. Standing on one of
the busiest streets in downtown San
Francisco at the back of a line that
stretches from the sidewalk all the way
down an alley beside the Curran Theater.
Blue leotards, click heels and not much
else.
Why?
"It's a chance to be in a professional
show," says Maryann Daley, one of the
last of over 200 women who tried out for
A Chorus Line Tuesday. "I figure the
worst that can happen is that I'll get
weeded out of the first group. But I need
the experience."
And most do spend more time in line
for the audition than in the theater. Out of
the 200 women, a little over 40 make it
through the process; from 150 men, about
30 are chosen.
Dance captain Tom Reed's eyes move
slowly down the line of 10 young men
standing downstage. He asks each to per
form two steps: a double pirouette and a
time step.
"That's the simplest thing to do," says a
student from the American Conservatory
Theater sitting in on the tryout. "Day one
at dancing school."
But only a few can do both steps with
even a hint of grace.
"Watch me fall off the stage now," says
Frank as he removes his glasses to attempt
the pirouette. "I hope not," replies Reed,
with more than a little distaste in his
voice.

Frank poses, twirls and nearly makes it
to the rim of the orchestra pit before catch
ing himself. "Oh, well," he sighs as he
picks up the spectacles. He admits to
Reed his inability to do a time step.
"Thank you." says Reed, and on down the
line.
Most of the time, Reed avoids comment
on even the worst peformance. He saves
his speeches for later stages of the screen
ing process, figuring there's no need to
shame those without experience. But
sometimes he can't hold back.
"Can I try it again?" asks John after
flubbing a time step. "I just learned it
now," he admits amid nervous laughter

from the rest of the line. Reed is game but
John's second attempt is closer to a jig in
army boots than a lightstep.
Next is Mike, a friend of John's. The two
have been practicing together and Reed
senses Mike might have done the instruc
tion. But Mike's performance makes it
clear that the blind were leading the blind
and Reed comments, "1 think you guys
need a new teacher."
The male contestants come in all
shapes and sizes, but the bulk of those
kept for the semifinal stage are the tall,
lean stereotypical stage males.
