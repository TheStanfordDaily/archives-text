# Tryouts give dancers the chance to dream

There are also a variety of costumes,
ranging from blue jean and T-shirt
combinations—with tennis shoes, of
course —to dance pants and shiny click
heeled shoes. But strangely enough, some
of the worst dancers are the most profes
sionally apparelled, and there are more
thana few prosamong the American Graf
fiti set.
Reed gives little clue as to his opinion
of the dancers until, after each line has
finished, he reads off the numbers of
those selected to stay on. But there ap
pears to be something of a correlation be
tween selecting a dancer and asking his
age after the dance steps.
Soon that correlation is discovered by
the participants.
"How old are you, Tony?" Reed asks
one hopeful. "Twenty, sir, ' Tony replies
brightly, then beams to his right, stretches
out his arms and mouths, "He's asking
ME!?!" Tony is kept on for the second
round.
Now it's the women's chance again.
Most of the female hopefuls were
screened before lunch, but Daley and
about 40 others have waited through the
guys' first stage to show off their dancing.
In contrast to their male counterparts,
the females' costumes give a good hint
about the coming performance. Perhaps
because of dancing school, the well
trained women are properly attired for an
audition.
And there are fewer rank amateurs; the
judging is far more difficult. But Reed

does his job just as efficiently and,

are back on Geary Street
