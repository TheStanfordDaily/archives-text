John Catania at Plant Services,
said that because the area had so
much construction and digging
going on, the surface was rather
broken and rough. So after the
work was done, the patchwork
surface was replaced with a
smooth one. To do this, a black
slurry coat was laid down.
This new coat did not cover up

anything that wasn't black be
fore. In other words, White Plaza
did not become Blacktop Plaza.
The new coat is just darker than
the old one, and probably in
time, will fade to the characteris
tic grey of the older asphalt sur
faces.

-G.B.
According to Robert Esparza,
associate planner at facilities
planning, the lights aren't ar
ranged to represent anything in
particular. It's "just aesthetic,"
he said. Like most other things. it
was simply in the design.
