Siector Robert kelley has

marshalled his troops well de
spite the script and the result is
an entertaining production,
especially in the faster-paced
second act.
The play, which revolves
around the efforts of Prof. Au
gust Howe (Mort Wisotsky) to
find the remains of the early
Mississippi mound-building
culture, is academic both in sub
ject and tone.
Its sarcastic wit, which is plen
tiful, is for the most part urbane,
even scholarly. The exceptions
are a few frankly slapstick scenes
which appear to be thrown into
the work without regard to the
rest of the play. The cast per
forms both types of comedy wel 1,

however.
Wisotsky does a fine job with
his role, which requires him to
provide a running narration
from his office in Urbana, 111. as
well as participate in the main
plot, a flashback to the previous
summer. Indeed, his witty side
shows between flashback scenes
are excellent breaks in the first
act.
His only weak spot is in the
finale, which is delivered with
out sufficient force to produce an
audience reaction, but he more
than makes up for this flaw in his
performance a few moments ear
lier when he quarrels with his
wife (Antoinette Wrubel) and
her paramour, Chad Jaskar
(Henry Woessner III).
Wrubel and Woessner, who
have a tough time overcoming
their strained lines in the first
act, come through well in the
second. Woessner, the son of the
dig's owner with visions of
riches in land development, is

especially moving as he turns
from bravado to despair as he
discovers there will be no high
way on his property, with its ac
companying potential for
wealth.
And Alden Crews, who plays
Wisotsky's young colleague, Dr.
Dan Loggins, excels in his rendi
tion of Wilson's biting sarcasm.
Though the lines, especially in
the first act, are uncomfortably
long. Crews' delivery does more
than justice to the script.
Crews' sarcasm plays well off
his wife (Jan Teter) and Wisots
ky's hypochondriac sister
(Bridget Ross), who together log
the best efforts of the production.
Teter is appropriately effete and
bitchy as a gynecologist uncer
tainly committed to life in gen
eral and to her husband's Scien
tific American idealism.
Along with the narration from
Wisotsky, the brightest moments
in the first act are provided by
Ross, who breaks into the inter

minable technical dialogue with
shrieks of "God, is it dismal
here!"
Ross says the line with the
kind of conviction which can
only come, as one imagines it
does, from a deserved anger at
Wilson for having written the
preceding harangues. Given the
maturity of her character, it is
appropriate that Ross speaks for
the cast in this attack by Wilson
on the flaws in his own work.
Marshall Watson gives the
players a break in his set design,
which utilizes nearly every inch
of the small Palo Alto Commun
ity Theater stage. He manages to
squeeze five focal points into
about 300 square feet, no mean
accomplishment. Elevation,
often overused on space
squeezing sets, was kept to a
minimum.
The company's only real mis
take was in selecting Wilson's
second major effort as the vehi
cle for a fine troupe of players.
