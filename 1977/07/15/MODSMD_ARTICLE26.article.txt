Brecht tells us, cannot be ac

where compassion is the excep
tion and cruelty is the rule.
It is a powerful statement that
demands able acting. Martin
Curland, as the merchant, grasps
the essence of the Brecthian bad
guy. The coolie, Sean Thomas
O'Connor, tries hard but his
voice lacks the subordination
and the meekness. Forest Rouse,
the proletariat hero and guide,
has a difficult part that calls for
quick changes from compassion
to disgust. His performance is
strong and compelling.
Susan Lichtman, the judge
who renders the decision about
the inhumanity of the modern
world, carries her role well. She

is forceful, rational and non
apologetic.
John Rouse's direction keeps
the play well paced through eas
ily defined demarcation of the
scenes. However, Rouse fails to
arouse enthusiasm in the sup
porting cast. They are sluggish,
apparently cognizant of their
secondary role in the play.
Staging
The staging is adequate; the
set is Brecht-tuse — barren,
black and shadowless.
Brecht intended The Measures
Taken to be a propagandaist
tract but it became an emotional
tragedy concerning the justifica
tion of the ends versus the means
in the international communist
movement.

The Measures Taken, using a
common Brechtian device of a
trial, involves the defeat of a
humanistic means which hinder
an idealogical end. Four Russian
agitators explain the execution
of a comrade because of his out
bursts which were timely and
sensitive yet harmed the overall
plan of the proletariat revolt.
Brechtian device
Before a control chorus that
represents the Soviet communist
party, the agitators re-enact the
scenes that led to the comrade's
death. According to Brecht's in
structions, the agitators alternate
playing the comrade before his
death. Its a strong device for pre
serving the identities of the
agitators. Director Robert Egan

and the four agitators ac
complish the necessary transi
tions fairly convincingly.
The agitators: Joseph Siravo,
Tricia Heaton, Malcolm Young
and Jamie Reid, in typical Mar
xist anonymity, give solid per
formances. The faceless control
chorus has good changes in
dynamics which adds power to
their outbursts of party dogma.
The overpowering content ot
the plays tends to subordinate
any acting performances except
the mediocre and the excep
tional. Stanford Drama Depart
ment's production lies in this
limbo. They do a good job but
because the plays are so literate
and over-bearing, the evening
belongs to one man — Bertholt
Brecht.
The plays last performance is
tonight at 8 p.m. at the Nitery.

Brecht tells us, cannot be ac

where compassion is the excep
tion and cruelty is the rule.
It is a powerful statement that
demands able acting. Martin
Curland, as the merchant, grasps
the essence of the Brecthian bad
guy. The coolie, Sean Thomas
O'Connor, tries hard but his
voice lacks the subordination
and the meekness. Forest Rouse,
the proletariat hero and guide,
has a difficult part that calls for
quick changes from compassion
to disgust. His performance is
strong and compelling.
Susan Lichtman, the judge
who renders the decision about
the inhumanity of the modern
world, carries her role well. She

is forceful, rational and non
apologetic.
John Rouse's direction keeps
the play well paced through eas
ily defined demarcation of the
scenes. However, Rouse fails to
arouse enthusiasm in the sup
porting cast. They are sluggish,
apparently cognizant of their
secondary role in the play.
Staging
The staging is adequate; the
set is Brecht-tuse — barren,
black and shadowless.
Brecht intended The Measures
Taken to be a propagandaist
tract but it became an emotional
tragedy concerning the justifica
tion of the ends versus the means
in the international communist
movement.

The Measures Taken, using a
common Brechtian device of a
trial, involves the defeat of a
humanistic means which hinder
an idealogical end. Four Russian
agitators explain the execution
of a comrade because of his out
bursts which were timely and
sensitive yet harmed the overall
plan of the proletariat revolt.
Brechtian device
Before a control chorus that
represents the Soviet communist
party, the agitators re-enact the
scenes that led to the comrade's
death. According to Brecht's in
structions, the agitators alternate
playing the comrade before his
death. Its a strong device for pre
serving the identities of the
agitators. Director Robert Egan

and the four agitators ac
complish the necessary transi
tions fairly convincingly.
The agitators: Joseph Siravo,
Tricia Heaton, Malcolm Young
and Jamie Reid, in typical Mar
xist anonymity, give solid per
formances. The faceless control
chorus has good changes in
dynamics which adds power to
their outbursts of party dogma.
The overpowering content ot
the plays tends to subordinate
any acting performances except
the mediocre and the excep
tional. Stanford Drama Depart
ment's production lies in this
limbo. They do a good job but
because the plays are so literate
and over-bearing, the evening
belongs to one man — Bertholt
Brecht.
