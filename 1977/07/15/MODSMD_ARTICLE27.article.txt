New York hit by power failure
New York — Electric power was slowly
being restored here, but New York City
was still paralyzed yesterday by a wide
spread blackout which began at 9:34
Wednesday night.
Consolidated Edison (Con-Ed)
spokesmen blamed the power failure on
an electrical storm that damaged trans
mission lines and caused a transformer to
explode. But no one had an explanation
for the failure of devices designed to pro
tect Con-Ed equipment from lightning.
"We don't know why they didn't
work," Joyce Tucker, Con-Ed assistant
vice-president said of the devices. "There
will be autopsy after autopsy after au
topsy."
The blackout brought the nation's
largest city to a standsill. Subways were
shut down, trading on the stock exchange
was suspended millions of workers had to
stay home, and looting was widespread.
Mayor Abraham Beame told the resi
dents, "It will not be possible to operate a
normal day. I urge you to stay home until
the emergency has been resolved."
In declaring a state of emergency,
Beame called for an investigation, saying,
"We cannot tolerate in this age of modern
technology a power system that can shut
down the nation's largest city."
The city transit authority reported that
about 1500 passengers and 15 subway
trains were trapped when the lights went
out, but the trains, operating under re
sidual power and without the benefit of
signals, crept into the nearest station and
unloaded their passengers within two
hours.
On Broadway, theaters went dark. At

the Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln
Center, a harpist in the company of the
National Ballet of Canada broke into a
rendition of "Dancing in the Dark" as the
lights went out.
Through the long, humid night, police
airested over 2500 looters. The fire de
partment said there were 1100 false
alarms.
At City Hall, where Beame and other
officials huddled by candlelight, an aide
stood up from his work to say: "It's going
to be a hell of a mess."
N. Koreans down U.S. copter
Washington — North Koreans shot
down a U.S. Army helicopter yesterday,
killing three crew members and captur
ing a fourth.
President Carter said the aircraft appa
rently strayed into communist territory
due to a "navigational mistake." He told
Senate leaders that he wants to make sure
"this does not escalate into a confronta
tion."
North Koreans charged that the
Chinook chopper had made a deep in
trusion into their airspace and was armed.
American officials said it was carrying
concrete for construction and was un
armed.
Carter said North Koreans fired a warn
ing shot at the helicopter. Then, he said,

the Americans "got out and inspected
their helicopter, and then got into the
helicopter and took off." After they took
off, the approaching North Koreans shot
down the chopper.
"We understand that two of the crew
members were killed when the helicopter
crashed," Carter said. "Another was kil
led in the exchange of gunfire in some
way we don't know yet. And the fourth
one apparently has been captured."
Press Secretary Jody Powell said the in
cident occured on or near the northern
portion of the 2.5 mile wide Demilitarized
Zone between North and South Korea.
He told reporters, "Any penetration of
North Korean air space was accidental
and regrettable."

allow the sale of saccharin and
saccharin-sweetened products for
another 18 months. However, cancer

N. Koreans down U.S. copter
Washington — North Koreans shot
down a U.S. Army helicopter yesterday,
killing three crew members and captur
ing a fourth.
President Carter said the aircraft appa
rently strayed into communist territory
due to a "navigational mistake." He told
Senate leaders that he wants to make sure
"this does not escalate into a confronta
tion."
North Koreans charged that the
Chinook chopper had made a deep in
trusion into their airspace and was armed.
American officials said it was carrying
concrete for construction and was un
armed.
Carter said North Koreans fired a warn
ing shot at the helicopter. Then, he said,

the Americans "got out and inspected
their helicopter, and then got into the
helicopter and took off." After they took
off, the approaching North Koreans shot
down the chopper.
"We understand that two of the crew
members were killed when the helicopter
crashed," Carter said. "Another was kil
led in the exchange of gunfire in some
way we don't know yet. And the fourth
one apparently has been captured."
Press Secretary Jody Powell said the in
cident occured on or near the northern
portion of the 2.5 mile wide Demilitarized
Zone between North and South Korea.
He told reporters, "Any penetration of
North Korean air space was accidental
and regrettable."

New York hit by power failure
New York — Electric power was slowly
being restored here, but New York City
was still paralyzed yesterday by a wide
spread blackout which began at 9:34
Wednesday night.
Consolidated Edison (Con-Ed)
spokesmen blamed the power failure on
an electrical storm that damaged trans
mission lines and caused a transformer to
explode. But no one had an explanation
for the failure of devices designed to pro
tect Con-Ed equipment from lightning.
"We don't know why they didn't
work," Joyce Tucker, Con-Ed assistant
vice-president said of the devices. "There
will be autopsy after autopsy after au
topsy."
The blackout brought the nation's
largest city to a standsill. Subways were
shut down, trading on the stock exchange
was suspended millions of workers had to
stay home, and looting was widespread.
Mayor Abraham Beame told the resi
dents, "It will not be possible to operate a
normal day. I urge you to stay home until
the emergency has been resolved."
In declaring a state of emergency,
Beame called for an investigation, saying,
"We cannot tolerate in this age of modern
technology a power system that can shut
down the nation's largest city."
The city transit authority reported that
about 1500 passengers and 15 subway
trains were trapped when the lights went
out, but the trains, operating under re
sidual power and without the benefit of
signals, crept into the nearest station and
unloaded their passengers within two
hours.
On Broadway, theaters went dark. At

the Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln
Center, a harpist in the company of the
National Ballet of Canada broke into a
rendition of "Dancing in the Dark" as the
lights went out.
Through the long, humid night, police
airested over 2500 looters. The fire de
partment said there were 1100 false
alarms.
At City Hall, where Beame and other
officials huddled by candlelight, an aide
stood up from his work to say: "It's going
to be a hell of a mess."
