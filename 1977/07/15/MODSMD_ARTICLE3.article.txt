# Trials start Monday
## Motions denied in protest case 
### Randy Keith 
Jury trials for 235 of the 294
protesters arrested in Old Union
May 9 will begin Monday at 9
a.m. as scheduled. Municipal
Court Judge Edward Scoyen de
nied two defense motions Wed
nesday which would have post
poned the trials or possibly
eliminated them altogether.
Scoyen denied a motion to
suppress photographic evidence
and a motion requiring a deposi
tion on the legal status of Public
Safety Department Director
Marvin Herrington.
In his ruling. Scoyen said pic
tures taken of protesters being
formally arrested were admissa
ble as evidence because the ar
rests were made legally.
Lawyers for the demonstrators
had contended that the arrests
were illegal because police did
not have "probable cause" to be
lieve that protesters had commit
ted the offenses for which they
were arrested.
"The officers didn't have
probable cause to make arrests
because they themselves had no
personal knowledge of what was
going on," said Harry Gruber, a
defense attorney.
Not present
He said some arresting officers
were not present when the warn
ing to disperse was given and
thus officers had "no way of
adequately knowing that those
people (the arrested protesters)
had been warned to leave."
Protesters were arrested on a
variety of charges including
trespassing, lodging and failure
to disperse after being warned to
do so. The district attorney's of
fice formally filed two trespas
sing charges and one failure to
disperse charge against each
protester.
'Continuing offense'
Tom Fahrenholtz, deputy dis
trict attorney, disputed the de
fense lawyer's claim. He said
probable cause to arrest was pre
sent because demonstrators
were arrested for "continuing
type offenses which were con
tinuing" at the time of each indi
vidual arrest. The protesters
were trespassing, as long as they
remained in the building,
Fahrenholtz added.
"The test (of whether the ar
rests were legal) is whether or
not the officers believed offenses

were being committed,"
Fahrenholtz added.
Scoyen, in his decision deny
ing the motion, said the arrests
were valid as long as "some
grounds for arrest exist."
Wednesday morning Scoyen
also denied a defense motion
which had asked Herrington be
required to file a deposition on
his legal status as a police of
ficer. Scoyen said the deposition
was unnecessary.
