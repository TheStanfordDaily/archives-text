# Recycling center evicted
## 
### 
A campus recycling center
which Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis said has been "a
headache for the whole year" re
cently received an eviction
notice from the University.
Mavis said the eviction notice
was issued July 6 and will take
effect Aug. 31. The recycling op
eration on Pampas Lane caused
traffic problems and had garbage
in public view, he said.
But Enid Pearson, conserva
tion director of the Peninsula
Conservation Cener which runs
the recycling operation, said the
operation has been "very suc
cessful."
"It's an inappropriate use of
land," Mavis said. "It doesn't
fit." He added that complaints
about the recycling center had
come from nearby credit union,
day care and food service opera
tions.
Pearson said the center had
not been a maintenance problem
except for a few days at the end
of spring quarter. At that time,
she said, "people deluged us.
For a couple of days.it was dif
ficult to get everything in."
The recycling operation hand
les newspapers and cans — and
deals with about 20 per cent of
recyclable material on campus,
Pearson said.
The operation was established
last year on a pilot basis, Mavis
said.
"We're willing to com
promise," Pearson said, "but
we're unwilling to leave."
