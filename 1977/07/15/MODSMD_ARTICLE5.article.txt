Migrant education
In the interest of good report
ing, may 1 correct the impression
and misquote of kathy Trafton's
article "A break for migrant
kids" (Daily. July 8).
All migrant students in the
Migrant Education Stanford Pro
ject came to Stanford with shoes
— some with more than two
pairs. Miss Trafton misquoted
me when she said "Some did not
have shoes when they came
here." Some of our students
purchased athletic shoes in the
Stanford Store, along with other
articles, but so does everybody
else. Her by-line "A break for
migrant kids" emphasizes the
poverty condition of the migrant
student, rather than the
achievement and talent of won
derful young people here at
Stanford.
In other words, Miss Trafton's
article drew attention to the
economic condition of our par
ticipants without mentioning
why their parents were poor or
why their achievements were so
outstanding. Their parents har
vest the crops which enrich the
well-being of every person here
at Stanford, in California, and
wherever their work is under
paid. They provide the profit
margin of the biggest industry in
California — agribusiness.
Despite hardships, our boys
and girls come from loving
families, they excel in school,
and here at Stanford they have
demonstrated that once they
have access to equal educational
opportunity , they can profit
from the educational process
much like other highly
'motivated young people.
The fact that many schools
with migrant students have
never graduated a single migrant
student, with a 100% drop-out
rate, corroborates the achieve
ment of the Migrant Education
Stanford Project predicated on
quality education and ability.
There is nothing gratuitious
about this program like the by

line implies. Our boys and girls
are high achievers despite obsta
cles and hardships.
What was unfortunate about
the article was the stereotype
that emerged. 1 know that the au
thor did not mean it, nor did I
express it. Stanford University is
very fortunate to have such
wonderful young people take
advantage of its resources and
facilities. Our boys and girls are
very fortunate to have this op
portunity. The Congress of the
United States which represents
the people and sources of sub
sidy would be very pleased with
this Stanford experience be
cause they want the best for the
tax-payers dollar, and that is
what we have. Kathy Trafton's
article should have stressed ta
lent and intellect; that's what our
program is all about.

Laetrile and strawberries

Further suppose that cancer vic

Question: Will the Food and

California — agribusiness.
Despite hardships, our boys
and girls come from loving
families, they excel in school,
and here at Stanford they have
demonstrated that once they
have access to equal educational
opportunity , they can profit
from the educational process
much like other highly
'motivated young people.
The fact that many schools
with migrant students have
never graduated a single migrant
student, with a 100% drop-out
rate, corroborates the achieve
ment of the Migrant Education
Stanford Project predicated on
quality education and ability.
There is nothing gratuitious
about this program like the by

line implies. Our boys and girls
are high achievers despite obsta
cles and hardships.
What was unfortunate about
the article was the stereotype
that emerged. 1 know that the au
thor did not mean it, nor did I
express it. Stanford University is
very fortunate to have such
wonderful young people take
advantage of its resources and
facilities. Our boys and girls are
very fortunate to have this op
portunity. The Congress of the
United States which represents
the people and sources of sub
sidy would be very pleased with
this Stanford experience be
cause they want the best for the
tax-payers dollar, and that is
what we have. Kathy Trafton's
article should have stressed ta
lent and intellect; that's what our
program is all about.

Laetrile and strawberries
Suppose some quack succeeds
in fooling people into believing
that the abundant ingestion of
strawberries cures cancer.
Further suppose that cancer vic
tims start gorging themselves on
strawberries instead of seeking
proper medical care.
Question: Will the Food and
Drug Administration prohibit
the sale of strawberries?

In the interest of good report
ing, may 1 correct the impression
and misquote of kathy Trafton's
article "A break for migrant
kids" (Daily. July 8).
All migrant students in the
Migrant Education Stanford Pro
ject came to Stanford with shoes
— some with more than two
pairs. Miss Trafton misquoted
me when she said "Some did not
have shoes when they came
here." Some of our students
purchased athletic shoes in the
Stanford Store, along with other
articles, but so does everybody
else. Her by-line "A break for
migrant kids" emphasizes the
poverty condition of the migrant
student, rather than the
achievement and talent of won
derful young people here at
Stanford.
In other words, Miss Trafton's
article drew attention to the
economic condition of our par
ticipants without mentioning
why their parents were poor or
why their achievements were so
outstanding. Their parents har
vest the crops which enrich the
well-being of every person here
at Stanford, in California, and
wherever their work is under
paid. They provide the profit
margin of the biggest industry in
California — agribusiness.
