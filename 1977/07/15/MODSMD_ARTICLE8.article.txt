# The 						'gutpopper' test

Al Schwartm

Armageddon, Nev.: The Hexagon today re
ported upon its latest test of the neuf bomb,
codenamed STYX (Say There, You're Extermi
nated), but widely referred to as "thegutpopper."
The neut bomb has been celebrated as being the
ultimate weapon since it kills only men, women
and children regardless of race, religion, creed or
national origin, without harming so much as a
single blade of grass or leaving residual death
lying around. It has been said that the neut bomb
"abolishes the clear delineation between the dam
age chemistry can inflict and the devastation
physics can wreak." in the words of the soldier in
the field, "it is a brothershucker."
The Hexagon was surprised to learn this morn
ing that Armageddon, Nevada was the home of the
world s only trilobite colony. It was under inten
sive study by the late Dr. Black and what was his
209 man research team.
Hexagon spokesman Corporal L. A rdass Wheery
regretted the accidental deaths. "They sacrificed
their lives to make their country strong," he said,
and officially regretted the deaths of the trilobites
which, "of course, had no business dying." He
further said that "the trilobite was a worthless bug
that did not fit into our atomic ecology. In the
interests of maintaininga uniform and minimally
diverse-a military-environment, it is our duty to
eliminate anything that exhibits signs of useless
individuality. The obliteration of the trilobite is a
tribute to administrative officers
everywhere.""After all," he said, "how would you
like if if your mailbox suddenly became transpa
rent?"
Corporal Wheery then showed pictures of the
remains of the 210 men at the sight of the bomb
test. They had been transformed into "high quality
organic mulch suitable for the cultivation of farm
crops or African Violets."
The neut bomb, a triumph of modern military
research, is the size of a .22 caliber bullet and costs
$49.95 to manufacture. It has a kill radius of ten
miles under ideal conditions and 60-100 miles on
cloudy days. Planned deployment includes 60
million "gutpoppers" along the Eastern European
front. "We are sure the Russians will now be more
than just fair weather friends. By assuring our
military superiority, we have achieved lasting
peace in our time."
Police units nationwide have requested the
"gutpopper" to arm their patrolmen in theevent of
massive civil disturbances, local Communist in
surrections or uncontrollable college campus

thought crimes.

Armageddon, Nev.: The Hexagon today re
ported upon its latest test of the neuf bomb,
codenamed STYX (Say There, You're Extermi
nated), but widely referred to as "thegutpopper."
The neut bomb has been celebrated as being the
ultimate weapon since it kills only men, women
and children regardless of race, religion, creed or
national origin, without harming so much as a
single blade of grass or leaving residual death
lying around. It has been said that the neut bomb
"abolishes the clear delineation between the dam
age chemistry can inflict and the devastation
physics can wreak." in the words of the soldier in
the field, "it is a brothershucker."
The Hexagon was surprised to learn this morn
ing that Armageddon, Nevada was the home of the
world s only trilobite colony. It was under inten
sive study by the late Dr. Black and what was his
209 man research team.
Hexagon spokesman Corporal L. A rdass Wheery
regretted the accidental deaths. "They sacrificed
their lives to make their country strong," he said,
and officially regretted the deaths of the trilobites
which, "of course, had no business dying." He
further said that "the trilobite was a worthless bug
that did not fit into our atomic ecology. In the
interests of maintaininga uniform and minimally
diverse-a military-environment, it is our duty to
eliminate anything that exhibits signs of useless
individuality. The obliteration of the trilobite is a
tribute to administrative officers
everywhere.""After all," he said, "how would you
like if if your mailbox suddenly became transpa
rent?"
Corporal Wheery then showed pictures of the
remains of the 210 men at the sight of the bomb
test. They had been transformed into "high quality
organic mulch suitable for the cultivation of farm
crops or African Violets."
The neut bomb, a triumph of modern military
research, is the size of a .22 caliber bullet and costs
$49.95 to manufacture. It has a kill radius of ten
miles under ideal conditions and 60-100 miles on
cloudy days. Planned deployment includes 60
million "gutpoppers" along the Eastern European
front. "We are sure the Russians will now be more
than just fair weather friends. By assuring our
military superiority, we have achieved lasting
peace in our time."
Police units nationwide have requested the
"gutpopper" to arm their patrolmen in theevent of
massive civil disturbances, local Communist in
surrections or uncontrollable college campus

thought crimes.
