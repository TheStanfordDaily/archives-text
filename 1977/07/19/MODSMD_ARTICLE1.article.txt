# Cool brew lows at Encina

For the first time in the Uni
versity's long, dry history, a stu
dent may walk into an on
campus establishment, legally
purchase a glass of beer and sit
down at a table to enjoy it.
That has been true for only
three weeks, since Encina Com
mons, the cafeteria behind En
cina Hall, began selling beer
June 27.
But students are only a few of
those buying the beer so far. ac
cording to Commons manager
Norma Young. She estimated
that 80 per cent of her patrons are
workers from surrounding of
fices and construction sites.
The proportion hasn't
changed much since beer sales
began, she said.

The Commons is currently
open from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
on weekdays, which Young said
partly explains the small
number of students. Young said
she may try a "happy hour" on
Fridays and extend closing time
into the evening.
"We're easing into it," Young
said. "We are setting a precedent
on campus, so we're being care
ful."
She explained that small
summer crowds are providing
an opportunity to work out the
problems with selling the suds
with a less hectic pace than in
the fall.
Checking identification for
proof of age is one of the new
tasks the Commons' employes
must get used to.

Young made it clear that
young-looking customers
should expect to show identifi
cation at least once in the serving
line. She said a formal ID card
with a picture is required.
"We've carded people who
haven't been carded in years,"
Young said. "Some people are
flattered to be carded." She
added that the oldest customer
whose identification she had
asked for turned out to be 53. She
went on to say that people had
been very cooperative.
The Commons is operated by
TDS, Inc., a food service com
pany which has a long-term con
tract with the University and
also runs the Transition, The
Coffee House, and the Political
Science Lounge.

In July, 1975, TDS first applied
to the California Alcoholic Be
verages Control Commission
(ABC) for a license to sell beer
and wine either in a pub planned
for Tresidder or in the Com
mons.
After hearings, delays and
more applications, a "beer on
sale" license was finally granted
by the ABC last April. Facility
alterations and new equipment
further delayed selling beer until
late June.
Young said the"beer on sale"
license allows the Commons to
sell only beer and prohibits cus
tomers from carrying any beer
off the premises.
"If someone does try to take it
out, we not only confiscate the
er. but we don't feel obligated
give a refund," Young said,
e explained this was because
t rules are posted in plain
|ht.
John Martin, assistant man
;rof TDS campus operations,
dtheUniversitv has been very
operative throughout the
ensing period. .
'They're just as interested in

us making a profit as we are," he
said.
The University's coopeation
with TDS is the culmination of
an 80-year controversy over
liquor on campus.
Leland and Jane Stanford
sponsored rules excluding
liquor from dormitories in the
Unviersity's second year. Off
campus drinking, once called
the "Menlo Habit," was toler
ated, however, until 1908.
In that year, an intoxicated
student returning from Menlo
Park entered the w r rong house in
Palo Alto, was mistaken for a
burglar and shot to death. From
that incident until 1966, drun
kenness was grounds for sus
pension.
A five-year study in the early
1960s showed that for three out
of four students here, "drinking
is well established . . . even at
the time they enter Stanford . .
and is apparently sanctioned by
their peers, their parents and
society."
In 1966, the Unviersity re
lented and said that although it
did not condone drinking, it rec
ognized it. Students were al
lowed to drink in residences
only, but the sale of alchohol on
campus remained expressly
prohibited.
Finally, in 1972, the Faculty
Club obtained a license to sell
hard and soft liquor, and began
doing so despite several pro
tests.

cording to Commons manager
Norma Young. She estimated
that 80 per cent of her patrons are
workers from surrounding of
fices and construction sites.
The proportion hasn't
changed much since beer sales
began, she said.

The Commons is currently
open from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
on weekdays, which Young said
partly explains the small
number of students. Young said
she may try a "happy hour" on
Fridays and extend closing time
into the evening.
"We're easing into it," Young
said. "We are setting a precedent
on campus, so we're being care
ful."
She explained that small
summer crowds are providing
an opportunity to work out the
problems with selling the suds
with a less hectic pace than in
the fall.
Checking identification for
proof of age is one of the new
tasks the Commons' employes
must get used to.

Young made it clear that
young-looking customers
should expect to show identifi
cation at least once in the serving
line. She said a formal ID card
with a picture is required.
"We've carded people who
haven't been carded in years,"
Young said. "Some people are
flattered to be carded." She
added that the oldest customer
whose identification she had
asked for turned out to be 53. She
went on to say that people had
been very cooperative.
The Commons is operated by
TDS, Inc., a food service com
pany which has a long-term con
tract with the University and
also runs the Transition, The
Coffee House, and the Political
Science Lounge.

In July, 1975, TDS first applied
to the California Alcoholic Be
verages Control Commission
(ABC) for a license to sell beer
and wine either in a pub planned
for Tresidder or in the Com
mons.
After hearings, delays and
more applications, a "beer on
sale" license was finally granted
by the ABC last April. Facility
alterations and new equipment
further delayed selling beer until
late June.
Young said the"beer on sale"
license allows the Commons to
sell only beer and prohibits cus
tomers from carrying any beer
off the premises.
"If someone does try to take it
out, we not only confiscate the

'They're just as interested in

us making a profit as we are," he

The University's coopeation
with TDS is the culmination of
an 80-year controversy over
liquor on campus.
Leland and Jane Stanford
sponsored rules excluding
liquor from dormitories in the
Unviersity's second year. Off
campus drinking, once called
the "Menlo Habit," was toler
ated, however, until 1908.
In that year, an intoxicated
student returning from Menlo
Park entered the w r rong house in
Palo Alto, was mistaken for a
burglar and shot to death. From
that incident until 1966, drun
kenness was grounds for sus
pension.
A five-year study in the early
1960s showed that for three out
of four students here, "drinking
is well established . . . even at
the time they enter Stanford . .
and is apparently sanctioned by
their peers, their parents and
society."
In 1966, the Unviersity re
lented and said that although it
did not condone drinking, it rec
ognized it. Students were al
lowed to drink in residences
only, but the sale of alchohol on
campus remained expressly
prohibited.
Finally, in 1972, the Faculty
Club obtained a license to sell
hard and soft liquor, and began
doing so despite several pro
tests.
For the first time in the Uni
versity's long, dry history, a stu
dent may walk into an on
campus establishment, legally
purchase a glass of beer and sit
down at a table to enjoy it.
