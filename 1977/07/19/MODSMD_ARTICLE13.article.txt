### George Anders 
After spending the last three
weeks directing a debate prog
ram for high school students
here, veteran debater John Roos
declared "some of those stu
dents knew a lot more than I did
by the end of it."
Roos headed the Forensics
Institute for High School Stu
dents, which concluded with a
tournament Saturday.
The institute, in its first year,
drew 50 high school debaters
from states as far away as Ohio
and Texas. It was intended as a
fundraiser for debate here, Roos
said, although he added he did
not know how much money it
had raised.
Stanford's debate team "was
in bad shape financially last
year," Roos said. "We're trying
to get it back on its feet."
Medical care
High school students in the
institute worked with a resolu
tion calling for a national com
prehensive medical care prog
ram, Roos said. "I was surprised
at how much those kids got into
it,"he said.
"The night before the tourna
ment, I would say about half the
kids stayed up all night prepar
ing for it,"he noted.
The institute's offerings in
cluded theory lectures from five
full-time instructors in the
morning, Roos said, followed by
lectures from Medical School
professors and other local ex
perts.
Afternoons were spent work
ing on extemporaneous presen
tations and other non-debate as-

pects of speech competitii
Roos said.
The sponsor
The institute was sponsored
by the Dean of Students Office.
Roos said he started work on
the institute in September, and
began lining up speakers in Feb-
ruary.
The institute included two
day programs as well as the three
week program which began June
26. Students who signed up for
the three week program paid
$447, most of which went to
meet room and board costs, Roos
said.
Roos was a member of the
Class of 1977, and participated
in many speech tournaments as
an undergraduate..
