ence's dingy blackened tables
and chairs. The difference is es

Koron makes an earnest at
tempt to get around this harrier;
flappers mingle with the crowd,
actors party at the bar, the spot
light pierces through the audi
ence to announce entrances. Its
all nice but not enough to over
come the audience-players sep
aration that has already occur
red.
While A Marvelous Party fails
to induce a time warp, it is great
entertainment. The plot is a shal
low device to bring the big
names together. George Ger
shwin, Ethel Merman, Fred As
taire and Ginger Rogers all show
up and do their stuff.
Once the song and dance
routines begin, the show snow
balls. It gains speed through
flashy tap numbers interspliced
with some not-so-tender comedy
ballads.
Virgil Pearson-Smith's Fred
Astaire is too accurate; his danc
ing is superb but as a crooner
he's often out of tune. Helen
Morgan (Carolyn Zarimba) has
too much classic beauty and not

enough lust for her part.
Gershwin (Barry koron) and
Merman (Julie Knox) steal the
show. Both koron and Knox
strongly resemble the charac
ters. When Gershwin steps to t he
elegant white grand to play
"Rhapsody In Blue," the audi
ence and players are united for
the only time. We're silent aw
struck. He does a great job that
could serve as a finale but no,
into the spotlight struts Big
Ethel. Brash, bossy and over
powering, her rendition of "I've
Got Rhythm" captures Merman
at her best. It's a marvelous
finale; the entire cast high step
ping and the audience is sent
home humming Gershwin
tunes.
Overall, its a good production.
The acting and singing is good,
and the dancing is generally al
right except some of the group
numbers lack polish. The brass
man in the four piece orchestra
has scattered intonation prob
lems.
A Marvelous Party is a lot of
fun. There's nostalgia present
but don't expect a total diver
sion, it just doesn't happen.
