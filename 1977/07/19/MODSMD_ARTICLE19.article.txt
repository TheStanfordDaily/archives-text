An 11 minute version of
"That's the Way (I like it)" put
everyone except the teenybop
pers into the doldrums.
For them, nothing could mar
the concert. Like the rest of the
audience, they waited patiently
for the end of Vernon Burch's
pathetic warm-up concert, then
exploded in screams as KG and
the Sunshine Band took the
stage.
Hundreds of pudgy, white
girls pressed around the stage,

ignoring security guards efforts
to push them away. Casey
played right to them, putting the
band into a holding pattern sev
eral times so he could prance
around the stage and throw roses
to the squealing masses.
Even the simplest bits of
choreography—a few steps for
ward or back—drew shrieks
from the teenyboppers. It's
doubtful that the band could
have done anyt hi ng to defuse the
groupies, or hide its musical
flaws from the rest of the crowd.
