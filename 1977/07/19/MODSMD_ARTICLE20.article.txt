## A 						Wilde hit 
### 
A flurry of French is heard
in the wings and after a few
moments of silence Oscar
Wilde strolls out onto the
stage. He holds a yellow
rose in one hand and his al
most auburn hair flam
boyantly curls at the ends.
One unconsciously sus
pends disbelief. The year is
1899 and Marines' Memo
rial Theatre becomes a
seedy Parisian concert hall.
The man onstage may bear a
slight physical resemblance
to Vincent Price but nothing
else. He captures the audi
ence with his first sneer and
holds it rapt till his final
haughty bow.
Diversions and Delight, a
one-man show, stars Vin
cent Priceasthebrilliant but
ailing Wilde. John Gay
creates the play, a lecture
presumably given the year
before Wilde's death, by
weaving excerpts from ac
tual lectures, as well as let
ters. This results in a fluid
speech where one incon
gruous subject flows natur
ally into another.
Wilde, a witty dandy, led
an extremely successful
writing career until he sued
the Marquess of
Oueensbury for criminal
libel and lost. He spent the
next two years in Reading
Prison, convicted of
homosexuality. The Wilde
presented has a middle-ear
infection (acquired in
prison) and drinks absinthe
throughout the performance
to ease the pain. While
physically submissive in
prison, he never becomes
subordinate in spirit.
Vincent Price, an actor
whose credits include over
100 films, is probably best
known for his horror
movies. One forgets all this,
however, when he steps
onstage as Wilde. Price
never slips out of the
slightly affected voice and
walk of his character. He
proves an admirable acting
talent in portraying the vain
and shallow, as well as the
thoughtful and philosophi
cal, aspects of Wilde.

Tony award winning di
rector Joseph Hardy keeps
the play moving at a brisk
pace. In the first act Wilde's
attitude of sharp but casual
sarcasm becomes bit
tersweet reminiscence. This
introduces the bitterness
and anger of the second act
when Wilde discusses his
days in prison.
Throughout the play
Wilde's quips raise one out
of the melancholy moods he
falls into. After speaking
morosely about Lord Alfred
Douglas, the man he con
siders his betrayer, respon
siblefor his prison sentence,
Wilde suddenly grins mis
chievously. "I have lied to
you tonight, don't you
know? Yes, you do know
but you don't know where
or when." His occasional
fidgeting is an effect of
prison life, while his total
ease on stage reflects his
self-confidence.
The set and lighting de
signer, H.R. Poindexter,
realizes the power of
simplicity. He uses only the
essentials, a tectum, chair
and table, for his set. His
lighting centers incon
spicuously on the play's
sole character, increasing
the audience's visual as well
as mental concentration on
Wilde. The costume de
signer. Noel Taylor, con
trols the opportunity for
gaudiness. knowing
Wilde's reputation as a
dandy. Wilde's costume,
though showy, is not
ludicrous.
The professionalism of all
the technical and artistic
forces in Diversions and De
lights produce a fine, highly
polished production. Only
one aspect shines brighter
than all else — Wilde's bril
liance.
One leaves the ACT
hosted performance filled
with Wilde's witticisms, in
cluding the closing "Give
me the luxuries of life and I
can dispense with the
necessities. Nothing suc
ceeds like excess."

tersweet reminiscence. This
introduces the bitterness
and anger of the second act
when Wilde discusses his
days in prison.
Throughout the play
Wilde's quips raise one out
of the melancholy moods he
falls into. After speaking
morosely about Lord Alfred
Douglas, the man he con
siders his betrayer, respon
siblefor his prison sentence,
Wilde suddenly grins mis
chievously. "I have lied to
you tonight, don't you
know? Yes, you do know
but you don't know where
or when." His occasional
fidgeting is an effect of
prison life, while his total
ease on stage reflects his
self-confidence.
The set and lighting de
signer, H.R. Poindexter,
realizes the power of
simplicity. He uses only the
essentials, a tectum, chair
and table, for his set. His
lighting centers incon
spicuously on the play's
sole character, increasing
the audience's visual as well
as mental concentration on
Wilde. The costume de
signer. Noel Taylor, con
trols the opportunity for
gaudiness. knowing
Wilde's reputation as a
dandy. Wilde's costume,
though showy, is not
ludicrous.
The professionalism of all
the technical and artistic
forces in Diversions and De
lights produce a fine, highly
polished production. Only
one aspect shines brighter
than all else — Wilde's bril
liance.
One leaves the ACT
hosted performance filled
with Wilde's witticisms, in
cluding the closing "Give
me the luxuries of life and I
can dispense with the
necessities. Nothing suc
ceeds like excess."
A flurry of French is heard
in the wings and after a few
moments of silence Oscar
Wilde strolls out onto the
stage. He holds a yellow
rose in one hand and his al
most auburn hair flam
boyantly curls at the ends.
One unconsciously sus
pends disbelief. The year is
1899 and Marines' Memo
rial Theatre becomes a
seedy Parisian concert hall.
The man onstage may bear a
slight physical resemblance
to Vincent Price but nothing
else. He captures the audi
ence with his first sneer and
holds it rapt till his final
haughty bow.
Diversions and Delight, a
one-man show, stars Vin
cent Priceasthebrilliant but
ailing Wilde. John Gay
creates the play, a lecture
presumably given the year
before Wilde's death, by
weaving excerpts from ac
tual lectures, as well as let
ters. This results in a fluid
speech where one incon
gruous subject flows natur
ally into another.
Wilde, a witty dandy, led
an extremely successful
writing career until he sued
the Marquess of
Oueensbury for criminal
libel and lost. He spent the
next two years in Reading
Prison, convicted of
homosexuality. The Wilde
presented has a middle-ear
infection (acquired in
prison) and drinks absinthe
throughout the performance
to ease the pain. While
physically submissive in
prison, he never becomes
subordinate in spirit.
Vincent Price, an actor
whose credits include over
100 films, is probably best
known for his horror
movies. One forgets all this,
however, when he steps
onstage as Wilde. Price
never slips out of the
slightly affected voice and
walk of his character. He
proves an admirable acting
talent in portraying the vain
and shallow, as well as the
thoughtful and philosophi
cal, aspects of Wilde.

Tony award winning di
rector Joseph Hardy keeps
the play moving at a brisk
pace. In the first act Wilde's
attitude of sharp but casual
sarcasm becomes bit
tersweet reminiscence. This
introduces the bitterness
and anger of the second act
