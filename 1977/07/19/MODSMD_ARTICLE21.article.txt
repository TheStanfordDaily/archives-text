Israel slashes budget
Tel Aviv — The new government in
Israel took drastic measures Sunday, cut
ting its defense budget by $143 million,
devaluing the Israeli pound and reducing
subsidies on food.
Finance Minister Simha Ehrlich an
nounced the economic change at a late
night news conference. It sets the stage for
the first confrontation between Prime
Minister Menahem Begin's new govern
ment and the opposition Labor Party.
The reduction in subsidies meant an
immediate jump in prices at supermar
kets and gasoline pumps of as much as 25
per cent. Transportation, electricity and
water will also rise an average of 25 per
cent, the government said.
The devaluation of the Israeli pound
will be approximately two per cent. It will
be the second such devaluation this
month.
Ehrlich said that drastic measures were
needed immediately to prevent the
pound "from becoming a worthless piece
of paper."
"Without these steps, we would have
spiraling inflation and a loss of foreign
currency reserves." he added.
The Central Committee of the Histad
rut. the massive labor federation control
led by the Labor Party, went into
emergency session to discuss the price
increases of such basics as milk, bread,
sugar, eggs and cheese. The Histaerut
claims to have 95 per cent of all Israeli
workers as its members.
A Treasury Ministry official called the
surprise announcement, "a distinct mes
sage to Washington." "Israel is doing its
utmost to cutback where it can. and we
hope the United States will do what it can

to help us," he said.
N. Korea releases solider
Panmunjom, Korea — After nine hours
of negotiations, the North Korean gov
ernment released Chief Warrant Officer
Glenn Schwanke. the only survivor of the
four men who were shot down in a U.S.
Army helicopter over North Korea
Thursday.
Schwanke walked across the demarca
tion line between North and South Korea
at sunset Saturday after 58 hours in cap
tivity. Minutes earlier, the bodies of his
three crew members were released to the
American-led U.N. Command here.
The release was rather rapid, prompt
ing U.S. officials to speculate if it was a
sign that North Korean President Kim II
Sundg is seeking better relations with the
United States.
On previous occasions where Ameri
can servicemen were taken by the North
Koreans, prolonged waiting, written
apologies, and conditions were charac
teristics of the release.
The only note of a disharmony came
from the American side after the ex
change had been completed.
Rear Adm. Warren Hamm Jr., senior
U.N. delegate to the armistice commis
sion. read a statement by President Jimmy
Carter.
It said, in part. "We deplore the loss ot
life and the use of force against an un

armed and inadvertant intrusion."

partment's border task force, were on the
