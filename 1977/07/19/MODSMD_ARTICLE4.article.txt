fending the 235 protesters who
started the first round of trials
yesterday is "approaching
$10,000," according to Eric
Berg, treasurer of the fund and
one of the students arrested.
The legal defense fund has
mailed letters to all protesters
telling them about recent de
velopments in the case and ask

he added.
A goal of $15,000 has been set
