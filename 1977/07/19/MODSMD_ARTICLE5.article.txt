# Star Wars: the cult
## 
### 
David Charnow

I've seen Star Wars. Twice. I
saw it three weeks ago on the big
screen in Boston. And I saw it
last week at the Old Mill Theatre
down on San Antonio Road.
This is not a review of the film.
For that, you can read the better
reviews which have appeared all
over. 1 do want to impress upon
you that I have had a fantastic
experience, and you have not,
yet, and that this fact is the be
ginning of the cult.
I stood in long lines for hours. I
paid outrageous prices. 1 have
seriously thought of getting a
Star Wars T-shirt. I've even nar
rowed it down to which of the
four shirts I would buy: the one
with Luke or the one with the
droids.
Now, if you wait until thelines
and prices go down, and go just
to see a "good flick," you will be
missing the cultic aspect of this
thing. Go see it now. Half, no,
more than half of the people
watching have seen it before. By
personal estimate, 80 per cent
are between the ages of 15 and
20. And 76 per cent are stoned,
off one thing or another. But it
still is good for the young and
the old, the stoned and the sober.
After seeing Star Wars for the
second time, I began to get to
gether with friends who have
seen it more than once, and ex
press my concern that the bad
guy did get away. That the Em
pire still exists. And of course,
the Princess is not married. I
suppose this means, in movie
talk, that they have left the op
tion open for a sequel.
You have, no doubt, heard a
lot about the special effects. The
one thing in this movie that I en
joyed was the one thing that

can't be seen: the Force. If you
don't know what I'm talking ab
out. well, I guess that's 0.k.. I
mean your life could certainly be
as rich and full as anyone else's.
It's just that I have another way
of expressing a hope and com
municating a faith when I say to
my people, "May the Force be
with you."
I want to warn you about a
kind of cognitive dissonence
here. I would think that
technological advance, over
planetary systems and such,
would imply some kind of cul
tural progress. Not so. The bad
guys are awful, and the good
guys still have to struggle. The
movie is one long chase scene.
I'm saying here that maybe in
some far future there won't be an
energy problem, or ecology
problem, but there will defi
nitely be people problems.
I feel silly writing this, trying
to sell it. You will see it. You will
all see it. I've never written a
movie review before. But I think
I have a kind of cultic side to
everything I do, including my
choice of graduate school. And
that's what I don't want you to
miss.
Listen. Let's have letters to the
editor over this thing. Let's buy
those T-shirts. Let's organize.
The administration won't mind,
there will be no arrests, no bad
consequences of other causes,
yet we can get all the benefits!
The issue is timely, the com
mittment is minimal.
Courage, friends. Call on it,
and Let the Force guide you.
