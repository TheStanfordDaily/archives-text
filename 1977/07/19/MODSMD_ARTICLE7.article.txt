# Women and the ERA
## 
### 
Why are so many women opposed to the Equal
Rights Amendment?
Recently the San Francisco Examiner con
ducted a straw poll, asking, "Are you in favor of
the Equal Rights Amendment becoming a part of
the Constitution?"
The results showed 52 per cent answered "No"
and 48 per cent replied "Yes." A number of letters
were printed, arguing one side or the other.
Some who voted "No" said existing legislation
is sufficient to protect women's rights. These
people have obviously never heard of "backlash
legislation" or the Supreme Court's right to de
clare legislation un-Constitutional.
Others who stated opposition to the ERA fell
back on the Anita Bryant bug-a-boo, "homosexual
marriage."
"The real civil rights issue," said one writer, "is
the right of straight citizens not to have gay values
imposed upon us." Now, even if gay marriages
were possible under the ERA, how would that
impose upon" heterosexuals? No straight would
be torced to marry a gay,
A token woman executive announced that her
personal ability and "our great Constitution" were
all she had ever needed to succeed, even thouuh
she "wore the wrong kind of pants."
Another writer menacingly noted, "If women
realized What the ERA was all about, they wouldn't
be so anxious for it to become part of the Constitu
tion. She didn't say what it was about.
One of the saddest letters came from a pair of
women who said, Women have been sheltered to
make a loving home for their family and to nurture
their children. There would be no romance were it
otherwise."
This kind of thinking is pathetic. Is romance in
smelly diaper buckets? Or the waxy yellow build
up on the floor? Or hearing the news that your
husband is deserting you, the nurturer of his chil
dren, tor a much younger woman who has more to
talk about than Billy's braces?
Most of the writers who answered the Examiner
poll were women. One signed herself, "Registered
o er, > an I'rancisco married woman," apparently
he facts she considers most important about her
self.
Others signed their husbands' names after the de
rigeur "Mrs." Perhaps they have no identities of

Why are so many women opposed to the Equal
Rights Amendment?
Recently the San Francisco Examiner con
ducted a straw poll, asking, "Are you in favor of
the Equal Rights Amendment becoming a part of
the Constitution?"
The results showed 52 per cent answered "No"
and 48 per cent replied "Yes." A number of letters
were printed, arguing one side or the other.
Some who voted "No" said existing legislation
is sufficient to protect women's rights. These
people have obviously never heard of "backlash
legislation" or the Supreme Court's right to de
clare legislation un-Constitutional.
Others who stated opposition to the ERA fell
back on the Anita Bryant bug-a-boo, "homosexual
marriage."
"The real civil rights issue," said one writer, "is
the right of straight citizens not to have gay values
imposed upon us." Now, even if gay marriages
were possible under the ERA, how would that
impose upon" heterosexuals? No straight would
be torced to marry a gay,
A token woman executive announced that her
personal ability and "our great Constitution" were
all she had ever needed to succeed, even thouuh
she "wore the wrong kind of pants."
Another writer menacingly noted, "If women
realized What the ERA was all about, they wouldn't
be so anxious for it to become part of the Constitu
tion. She didn't say what it was about.
One of the saddest letters came from a pair of
women who said, Women have been sheltered to
