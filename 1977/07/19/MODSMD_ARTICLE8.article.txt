xperts hope will help) addicts
reak their habits.

oundation is also testing Nal
ronex. what clinic head Dr.
ivram Goldstein, a biochemis-
Tprof here, calls "a possible
elp" in eliminating narcotic
ravings.
It proved effective, LAAM
rould replace methadone, the
eroin substitute which causes
evere side effects and over 1000
eaths every year.
Patients who successfully use
AAM for at least three months
rould be encouraged to use Nal
fonex. Goldstein said.
With the new drugs, he said
all the deceit, game-playing
nd manipulation" associated
nth methadone will end. Pa
cnts will not need to smuggle

home doses or cheat on lab tests,
Goldstein said because the
chemicals don't create
methadone's vicious daily
high-low cycle.
He said LAAM is no "cure . ..
but it buys time so our patients
can get themselves together."
Naltronex gives ex-addicts
"the help you need to not use —
or not to feel it if you do use, and,
therefore, not go get strung out,"
Goldstein said.
LAAM (levo-alpha
acetylmethadol) was developed
25 years ago to help heroin ad
dicts relieve withdrawal pains.
As powerful and addictive as he
roin or methadone, it does not
cause intense "highs" or the
need for frequent use which
made methadone an impractical
rehabilitation drug.
Naltronex is an opiate an
tagonist, a non-addicting agent
which biochemically blocks the
effects of narcotic drugs.
