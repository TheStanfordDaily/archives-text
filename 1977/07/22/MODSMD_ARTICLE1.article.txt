figures released by

Asst. Registrar Gloria Garing, are
30 persons who were high
school students during the
academic year.
"Things look pretty good,'
Garing said. "In some areas
we're up students from last
year."
Also enrolled are 470 terminal
graduate students, 262 post
doctoral fellows and 31 persons
with permits to attend (PTAs).
These PTAs are issued primarily
to persons taking music classes
on a noncredit basis, Garing
said.
About 1000 persons registered
after registration day, Garing
said, adding that "this seems to
have been a busy summer.'
Oman said he did not know
how the leveling trend here
compared with summer sessions

at other schools.
Four evening classes were
added this summer to bring in
local residents who would not
normally take classes at the I Jni
versity, Oman said.
But Oman said yesterday that
these classes have not received
"the overwhelming flood of
community people I would have
expected."
Some community people are
enrolled in the classes though
Oman said, including "several
who wouldn't have taken classes
here otherwise."
These evening classes are in
statistics, English, religious
studies and sociology.
Overall, "there isn t anything
extraordinary" about this year s
registration, Oman said.
