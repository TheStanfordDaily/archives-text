# 'Orca'/Paul Miller
## Soggy fish story 
### 
Dino De Laurentiis' latest production, Orca,
though quite enjoyable, never reaches its full
potential.
The film deals with Richard Harris, a
frightened Irish fisherman, and a male killer
whale, whose mate has been hunted down by
Harris.
Orca begins with Harris trying to capture a
whale to make money. He kills the whale but
the late whale's mate challenges Harris face to
face at sea.
The whale then begins to destroy everything
along the shore in an attempt to get Harris to
come out and fight. It succeeds.
Charlotte Rampling, as a Newfoundland (the
locale of the action) marine biologist, talks Har
ris into going out to fight the whale, building

the dramatic climax.
The picture suffers a great deal from Luciano
Vincenzoni and Sergio Donati's uninspired
script. But the constant excitement throughout
the film vastly makes up for it.
Richard Harris, in the lead human role (the
whale is the main lead), gives one of the best
performances of his career. He makes a lot out of
his meaningless dialogue.
Charlotte Rampling as the cold, charmless
whale expert is quite weak in the role. Will
Sampson, who gave that unforgettable perfor
mance as "Chief" in One Flew Over the Cuc
koo's Nest, also adds virtually no spark to his
dreary lines.
Orca is still a lot of fun and does demand to be
seen.
