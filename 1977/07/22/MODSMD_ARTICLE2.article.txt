# Protesters convicted on two sit-in counts

### Randy Keith 
The first seven South Africa
protesters to go to trial were
found guilty yesterday of two of
three charges filed against them
for occupying Old Union May 9.
All were put on six months pro
bation and six were fined $05.
The group was found innocent
of entering Old Union with the
intent to obstruct lawful busi
ness.
The guilty verdicts on charges
of refusing to leave private prop
erty after being ordered to do so
and failure to disperse on the
order of a police officer came
after the jury had deliberated for
nearly Vk hours.
Defendants Geoffrey
Creighton. Dan Howard. Frances
Lowery. David Runsten and Ray
Sten are Stanford students. Kath
leen McCall, a student spouse,
and Vicki Campbell, assistant
manager of the Coffee House,
were also defendants.
Creighton's father, University
controller and acting vice presi
dent for business and finance,
watched the final arguments. He
refused to talk to the press.
Same sentence
In sentencing the de
monstrators, Municipal Court
Judge Edward Scoyen said they
deserved the same sentence as
protesters who had earlier
pleaded guilty or no contest be
cause "we don't penalize people
for exercising their constitu
tional right" to go to trial.
Scoyen said the four-day trial

had cost Santa Clara County
about $750 per day and that ar
resting all 294 protesters had
cost the University and the
county $12,000. The protesters
were "not getting any support or
friends from the people of Santa
Clara County," he said.
Defendent Sten, not fined be
cause he signed a citation when
he was arrested, told Scoyen he
had "no regret by having incur
red the court any monetary ex
penses. The fine and probation is
no small cost to our own lives
too," he added.
Respect
Scoyen went on to say "in the
technical sense you are crimi
nals because you have been con
tacted." but he added, "you
people care and I respect you."
In a sometimes high pitched
voice accompanied by vigorous
gesticulating, Dep. Dist. Atty.
Tom Fahrenholtz argued that the
protesters had entered the Old
Union with the intention of dis
rupting the work going on in the
building. "They (the protesters)
put up their loudspeaker in the
lobby and let it rip,' he said.
Dean of Student Affairs lames
Lyons testified Tuesday there
was "one incident" of a student
commenting that it was a "has
sle" to get to Lyon's office.
Defense attorneys Jerry Fogel
and Tony Estramera disputed
the district attorney's claim say
ing that "people (the protesters)
went out of their way to avoid
the disruption of business" by
clearing aisles.
Registrar Sally Mahoney tes
tified that all of the lobby win
dows for the registrar's office
were open and that business
could be conducted despite the
noise.
No obstruction
The jury found the defendents
innocent of obstructing busi
ness.
Fahrenholtz also argued that
the protesters had violated the
law by occupying the building
after being ordered out by Robert
Rosenzweig, vice-president for
public affairs.
Fahrenholtz claimed that the
defendents were "there at the
time of the admonitions (warn
ing to leave or face arrest)."
When they did not leave they
were arrested and charged with
violating the law, Fahrenholtz
said.
Fogel in his final argument
said there was "no way of know
ing beyond a reasonable doubt

whether these people (the seven
defendents) were there when the
warnings were given."
He introduced two witnesses
who claimed they had walked in
the front doors of Old Union
after it had been closed by the
Sheriff's Office. The security
"leaked likea sieve," Fogel said.
Fahrenholtz further argued
that for the defendents to be con
victed of being present at an un
lawful assembly it was "not
necessary that the defendent
participate in the original un
lawful assembly (when the
warnings were given.)"
