Flood strikes Johnstown
Johnston, Pa. — At least 37 persons
have been lcilled in a new Johnston flood,
the city's worst since 1889.
The flood was triggered by an eight
hour rainfall which washed away roads
and knocked out earthen dams. Some
areas of the city were under at least eight
feet of water before the flood began to
recede.
President Jimmy Carter has declared
seven counties in the Conemaugh Valley
a disaster area enabling them to receive
federal funds. Gov. Milton Shapp said he
is also making plans to release an addi
tional $1 million in state aid.
"It's too early to tell how much money
we will need," the governor said. "We
just have no way of assessing the total
damage."
Shapp said the White House action
would allow local authorities to begin
purchasing badly needed food,
emergency equipment and medical
supplies.
The flood is a grim reminder of the
flood of 1889 which obliterated this coal
and steel town in the Conemaugh Valley
50 miles east of Pittsburgh. That time
2209 persons died.
No one was guessing how many more
bodies would be found in this flood.
"We are going after the living first and
then the dead will come later," said Rich
land Township Police Chief James Mock.
Meanwhile, the residents of ravaged
Johnstown were beginning the hard work
of cleaning up.
"You don't find anyone sitting around
and crying," said Police Chief Ed Piur
kowsky. "They will probably rebuild
Johnstown better than it was before the

flood."
Begin rules out PLO
Washington — Israeli Prime Minister
Menahem Begin said Wenesday he had
proposed to President Carter that "mixed
commissions" be set up and reconvened
at a Middle East peace conference this fall
in order to negotiate peace treaties and
permanent boundaries with Egypt, Syria
and Jordan.
He flatly ruled out any role for the
Palestine Liberation Organization or any
of its members at the conference in
Geneva.
"Their design, bluntly and simply, is to
destroy our country and to destroy our
people," Begin said at a news conference
after his final meeting with President Car
ter.
Carter told reporters that the Geneva
conference "very likely" will be recon
vened in October despite the differences
between the Arab states and Israel.
At the news conference. Begin declined
to outline the territorial concessions Is
rael might be prepared to make in ex
change for peace treaties.
Jaworski to probe House
Washington—Former special Water
gate prosecutor Leon Jaworski agreed
Wednesday to become chief investigator
of the House probe into alleged Korean

influence-buying in Congress.
Jaworski accepted the assignment
without pay, after having received unpre
cedented assurance from House leaders
that he would have the same privileges
he had while Watergate prosecutor.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (Dem-
Mass.), said he would have "complete
freedom to do a complete and thorough
job no matter whom it touches."
Jaworski accepted the job in a tele
phone call to John Flynt (Dem-Ga.),
chairman of the House Ethics Committee
conducting the investigation.
When Jaworski accepted, Flynt replied,
"I'm indeed grateful and appreciate it
more than words can say."
The 71-year-old Texas lawyer will suc
ceed Philip Lacovara. who resigned from
the post last Friday in a dispute with
Flynt.
As Watergate prosecutor, Jaworski had
obtained the so-called "smoking gun"
tape that forced Nixon to resign on Aug. 9,
1974.

is also making plans to release an addi

"It's too early to tell how much money
we will need," the governor said. "We

Shapp said the White House action
would allow local authorities to begin
purchasing badly needed food,

The flood is a grim reminder of the
flood of 1889 which obliterated this coal

No one was guessing how many more

Meanwhile, the residents of ravaged
Johnstown were beginning the hard work

"You don't find anyone sitting around

kowsky. "They will probably rebuild
Johnstown better than it was before the

flood."

Meanwhile, the residents of ravaged
Johnstown were beginning the hard work
of cleaning up.

and crying," said Police Chief Ed Piur

Johnstown better than it was before the

flood."
