# Prof: lost continent a reality
## 
### 
The formation of the Rocky
Mountains and identical fossils
10,000 miles apart can be
explained by postulating
Pacifica, a lost continent in the
Pacific Ocean, according to
Amos Nur, associate geophysics
professor.
Nur said he developed the
theory about a year ago, along
with Israeli researcher Zvi Ben
Avraham, and has since been re
fining the theory.
"When I first came up with the
theory, the question was
whether I could prove that it was
a possible explanation," he re
called.
"Later, people agreed that it
was a possible explanation and
now the debate is on whether I
placed Pacifica in the right
spot," he added.
Crash theory
In a speech last month before
the American Geophysical Un
ion, Nur said fragments of
Pacifica collided into the west
ern United States and Canada
about 120 million years ago
forming the Rockies, Cascades
and Sierras.
Other fragments, he said,
formed mountains in Alaska,
Siberia and South America's
western shore.
Nur said the existence of a
fragmenting Pacifica would also
explain why identical fossils
have been found in China, New
Zealand and Canada.
