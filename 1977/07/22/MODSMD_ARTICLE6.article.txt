Attempted rape
Wednesday afternoon, as 1 was
out jogging in the hills behind
Stanford, 1 was attacked by a
man who tried to rape me. 1 man
aged to fight him off and re
ported the incident, and he was
apprehended. I am writing this
letter for the benefit of other
women in the community, so
that they will be aware of the
danger they are in and also of the
importance of reporting such
crimes immediately.
My initial impulse was not to
call the police, but to seek com
fort with friends. Shaken as 1
was, I was also reluctant to
knock on a stranger's door and
ask to use the phone. If I hadn't
called right away, however, it
would have been difficult or im
possible to find and positively
identify the offender.
The problem for me now is the
fear that I am left with and what
to do about it. I have enjoyed for
months running alone in the
hills, and considered it safe. It
infuriates me that my freedom is
curtailed merely because I am a
woman. However, though rape
is not common on campus, I
would now find it hard to enjoy a
solitary run, given my experi

ence that it is possible.
I would also like to respond to
a letter from James Sheats
(Daily, July 12), in which he ob
jected that calling all men poten
tial rapists is like calling all
Germans potential Nazis. I cer
tainly do not suspect that men I
know and trust might at some
time in the future rape a woman.
However, until I have some clue
to his character, every male
stranger is a potential rapist and

recycling center located on
Pampas Lane. Having gone to
college in the somewhat
ecologically-unconcerned East, I
was extremely pleased to find
recycling operations in full force
on the Stanford campus.
Now, however, because "it
doesn't fit" (whatever that
means) and because it has al
legedly been "a headache for the
whole year" (although not for
those of us who utilize its valu

is unimportant.
According to Plant Services,
the center causes traffic prob
lems; as an Escondido Village
resident, my only encounters
with "traffic" have been with the
cars on Serra Street (campus, not
Pampas bound) and the E.V. ac
cess road.
Additionally, Plant Services
has said that garbage is in public
view; the only members of the
"public" that can see the opera-

cal. Rather than evict ther
ing center, why not prov
with some other space on
ford's vast acreage? Surely
must be some place on ca
that is out of "public vie\
of heavy traffic areas, andy
enough room for ade(
facilities for the "garbage'
